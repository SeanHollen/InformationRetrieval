   Leftist guerrillas attacked the
1st Army Brigade headquarters Thursday evening with
rocket-propelled grenades and rifle fire, and combat raged through
the capital for more than an hour.
   Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the brigade, told journalists
six rebels were killed in the fighting, which panicked thousands of
residents of the city's northern sector. He said five militarized
National Police, one army soldier and three civilians were wounded.
   The fighting was the heaviest in the capital in at least a year.
   Zepeda said four men aboard a jeep fired U.S.-made M-69 grenades
and Soviet-made RPG-18 rocket-propelled grenades into the brigade
headquarters at dusk.
   He said six or seven projectiles landed inside the base
perimeter, causing property damage but no casualties.
   The brigade commander said combat in the neighborhoods of
Zacamil, Mejicanos and around the headquarters of Transit Police
broke out after police and soldiers clashed with retreating
guerrillas. He estimated about 30 insurgents took part in the
attack.
   Rebel spokespersons called several local radio stations to say
the strike comprised coordinated attacks on four military and
police posts. The rebels said the actions was part of an offensive
called ``All against Arena. We're Going to Win.''
   President-elect Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, is to take office from outgoing
Christian Democrat Jose Napoleon Duarte on June 1.
   Earlier Thursday, the rebels declared a natiowide transport ban
for the inauguration.
   ``We call on all our units to enforce the ban and the people to
observe it in repudiation of this government from the moment of its
inception,'' said a communique issued by the high command of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The indefinite ban is to begin at 12:01 a.m. May 31. Previous
transport bans have lasted an average of three days.
   An estimated 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas are waging a
9-year-old revolution against the U.S.-backed government. The war
has killed about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.
   The rebels periodically call transport bans and enforce them
with threats and sabotage. The previous ban, during the March 19
presidential election, virtually paralyzed interprovincial
transport.

   An East German cleaning a road near
the West German border suddenly gunned the engine of his
street-sweeping vehicle and safely escaped from his communist
homeland, police said.
   The 62-year-old man fled Wednesday as two East German border
soldiers were overseeing his work, but there were no reports of any
shots being fired, said a statement by the Bavarian border police.
   The worker, who was not identified, was operating the
streetcleaner on East German turf near the West German checkpoint
at Eussenhausen, about 75 miles northeast of Frankfurt.
   According to Bavarian border police, he suddenly stepped on the
gas and savely drove the machine onto Bavarian soil.
   The man's wife has been visiting in West Germany and he decided
to join her after she told him she would not be returning to
communist East Germany, the police statement said.
   The statement said West German officials planned to return the
street-cleaning machine to East German authorities.

   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and another
leading liberal were placed in custody as hardliners moved to
stifle political opposition and end massive demonstrations for
democracy, sources said Friday.
   Communist Party and East European sources said Wan Li, the head
of China's legislature who also is associated with the liberal
camp, was detained in Shanghai after returning from a trip to the
United States.
   The reports, which could not be officially confirmed, further
supported recent indications that party hardliners, led by senior
leader Deng Xiaoping and Premier Li Peng, have taken command in the
current power struggle.
   There also have been signs in the official media that
conservatives have been winning the battle for control of China,
most recently an appearance by Li on nationwide television in which
he defended his martial law crackdown in Beijing.
   Sources said Zhao, one of the architects of China's economic
reforms, was stripped of power and was under house arrest. His
movements were being restricted.
   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman insisted Thursday that Zhao was
still the party general secretary. But he has not been seen or
heard from since May 20, when Premier Li declared martial law in
Beijing and ordered troops to restore order in the capital.
   A government source also said President Yang Shangkun, a Deng
ally, delivered a speech Thursday that strongly criticized Zhao for
his activities during the current pro-democracy student movement
that triggered the political crisis.
   Yang, speaking to members of the party Politburo, retired
revolutionary leaders and Beijing delegates of the National
People's Congress, or legislature, said Zhao's actions ``had a very
bad effect'' on the nation.
   Yang said Zhao added to the disturbances with his actions, which
included expressing sympathy for the goals of the students and
guaranteeing the students would not face reprisals.
   Students initially were calling for a dialogue with the
government to discuss corruption and sweeping political changes.
Since martial law was declared, they have demanded the ouster of
Premier Li and Deng.
   A day before martial law was declared, Zhao and Li went to
student-occupied Tiananmen Square to talk to students on a hunger
strike for democratic reform.
   But whereas Li left after a few minutes, Zhao, with tears in his
eyes, made an impassioned speech calling for conciliation between
the government and the students.
   Yang also said the People's Liberation Army, prevented from
entering Beijing by tens of thousands of citizens who have blocked
roads and set up barricades, would eventually move in to assume
military control of the streets.
   But he said the army would stay out for the time being ``in
order not to worsen the situation.''
   The 81-year-old president also indicated that Communist Party
members who have participated in the popular uprising will be
punished.
   The government will continue to acknowledge that the student
movement is patriotic, he said, ``but as for the others, they were
controlled by a small band and will be suppressed.''
   Thousands of party members from state-run news organizations,
research institutes, ministries and factories have joined the
demonstrations. Many have joined the common call for the
resignations of Premier Li and Deng.
   Two sources said National People's Congress chairman Wan Li was
being held in Shanghai after being prevented from returning to
Beijing on Thursday.
   While in Canada and the United States, Wan had praised the
students as leading a patriotic movement and urged a peaceful
resolution to the standoff between the government and the students.
   He cut short his trip and returned to China early Thursday. The
official Chinese press said he was staying in Shanghai for
``medical treatment.''
   Sources said the fate of Hu Qili, who recently was reported to
have backed Zhao, was less clear. Some said he was under house
arrest. Others said only that it appeared he was in trouble. Hu, in
addition to sitting on the Politburo Standing Committee, is in
charge of propaganda work in the party.
   Premier Li made his first public appearance Thursday since
declaring martial law six days ago.
   Appearing confident and relaxed at a welcoming ceremony for
three new ambassadors, Li said that ``anyone with common sense''
should realize the army could enter Beijing if it wanted to.
   ``But our government is a people's government and our army is a
people's army,'' state-run television news showed Li telling the
ambassadors from Mexico, Burma and Liberia.
   He said the troops would enter the city after citizens
understood the reason for the martial law order. He did not
elaborate.
   More than 100,000 workers and intellectuals, meanwhile, defied
Li's martial law crackdown for the second time this week and
marched Thursday in a sea of banners, calling for freedom and the
resignation of Li and Deng.
   In another sign that Zhao had lost out to Li, state-run radio
reported that 27 out of 29 provinces have backed the martial law
order. Already, six out of China's seven military regions have
expressed support for the crackdown. Only the Beijing military area
has been silent.
   A shrill letter, published in all major newspapers and broadcast
on the radio and television Thursday, further indicated that the
military was closing ranks around Li.
   The letter by the army Headquarters of General Staff and General
Political Department strongly supported Li's hardline position.
   ``If we let their plot succeed, then the results of 10 years of
struggle to reform China ... will be for naught,'' it said.
   The protests are the biggest spontaneous political movement in
Communist China's 40-year history. Li's hard-line stance apparently
reflects the views of Deng, who has tried to reduce central
controls of China's economy but refuses to relax tight political
control.
   Troops remained poised on Beijing's outskirts Thursday, but none
have openly entered the central districts. Hundreds of thousands of
citizens surrounded their trucks and threw barricades across
streets to keep them out. After days of standoff, most of the
troops pulled into military and other compounds.
   A circular from the State Council, China's cabinet, said
students forced their way onto trains to Beijing, hindering efforts
to end turmoil in the capital and disrupting rail operations. Tens
of thousands of students have poured into the city over the past
few weeks from as far away as Kasgar near China's northwestern
border.
   The State Council also sent a letter to troops expressing hope
they ``will overcome the difficulties confronting them (and)
successfully impose martial law.''
   Under government regulations, foreign reporters are banned from
conducting interviews on the street and in schools, government
offices, factories and other places.
   In Washington, the State Department said the Voice of America
added two Chinese language frequencies to compensate partially for
three frequencies that Chinese authorities began jamming Monday.
   State-run media said China's Red Cross urgent appealed for
students to leave Tiananmen Square to avoid deteriorating health
conditions there.

<HEAD>Young Afrikaners Questioning Their Role as Apartheid's Heirs</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Friday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young Afrikaners have begun
questioning their role as apartheid's heirs.
   In recent months, the first anti-apartheid newspaper published
in Afrikaans has doubled its circulation to 8,000 and provided
publicity for a new wave of alternative culture.
   Three anti-establishment Afrikaner rock bands have been drawing
enthusiastic crowds at campuses and theaters during an
unprecedented nationwide tour.
   The movement is small as yet.
   Most Afrikaner children grow up in tight-knit, conservative
families and attend rigid state schools where curriculum is
tailored to fit government ideology. Young white men must serve two
years in the military, prolonging the period in which they are
screened from other ways of thinking.
   ``Afrikaners have a very authoritarian tradition _ children are
meant to be seen and not heard,'' said Max du Preez, editor of the
7-month-old newspaper Vrye Weekblad (Free Weekly). ``This has
retarded the growth of young people. We're all late bloomers.''
   Du Preez's newspaper is aimed both at readers who already have
broken with apartheid and at those who still condone the concept of
white-minority rule under the National Party government.
   ``We have a converting role, a responsibility to stimulate
Afrikaners who are on the verge of breaking away and to provide a
new home for them,'' du Preez, 37, said in an interview. ``It's
been a very lonely place to be, to be an Afrikaner who has broken
with apartheid.''
   It doesn't seem lonely at the boisterous concerts of the Voelvry
(Free Bird) rock `n' roll tour, which succeeded despite being
banned from several places. One of the touring groups is called Die
Swart Gevaar _ ``The Black Menace'' _ and is a phrase used in
describing whites' fears o a black majority takeover.
   Dirk Uys, manager of another group called the Gereformeerde
Blues Band, told one music writer: ``We're bringing home a lot of
those homeless people who have never been able to identify with the
current state of Afrikaans culture.''
   Says the leader of the Blues Band, Johannes Kerkorrel: ``If you
can make a language into rock `n' roll, it can't be an oppressive
language any more.''
   Along with the alternative music movement is an upsurge in
provocative, topical Afrikaans drama, with new works surfacing
regularly from university-based playwrights.
   ``This radical school of dramatists challenges and even
undermines the principles and mores on which Afrikanerdom is
based,'' said The Weekly Mail, an English-language anti-apartheid
newspaper.
   About 60 percent of South Africa's 5 million whites are
Afrikaners, descendants of Dutch and other European settlers who
began arriving here 337 years ago. Only in 1948 did the Afrikaners
take full control of the government, and they proceeded to enact
the harsh segregation laws of apartheid, force millions of blacks
from their homes, and suppress campaigns for black rights.
   Small numbers of Afrikaners have opposed apartheid since the
1960s, and their ranks have grown since the widespread black unrest
of 1984-86, but most remain opposed to black majority rule and
uninterested in learning about other political perspectives.
   Mike Joubert, who last year was president of the student council
at the University of Pretoria, said most of the 22,000 students at
the Afrikaans-language school were preoccupied with academics and
social life and had ``a very strong antipathy toward any kind of
political activity.''
   ``They were very uninformed,'' said Joubert, a nephew of Foreign
Minister Pik Botha. ``They accept anything they read or see on
television.''
   Only a few hundred students were active in either left-wing or
right-wing political groups, said Joubert, who is now in business
school. Many of the others might accept major political reforms but
would need to be led in that direction, he said.
   At the University of Stellenbosch, the most prestigious
Afrikaans university, a slightly more liberal mood prevails. A ban
on the Voelvry tour provoked emotional protests, and there was
widespread support for a group of 18 students who went to Zambia in
April to participate in forums that included members of the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement.
   The Dutch Reformed Church, by far the largest Afrikaner
denomination, has suffered fewer defections of young people than
major Protestant churches in the West, according to Dr. Pierre
Roussouw, a senior church official.
   He said more than 90 percent of the youths who are baptized by
the church complete the process that leads to adult membership.
Services at university chapels are packed, he said.
   ``There are victims of secularization, and we're worried about
that,'' he said. ``But we have much to be thankful for.''
   One of the factors behind the church's strength, said Roussouw,
is Christian National Education, the education system at white
public schools that promotes Afrikaner nationalism,
Calvinist-oriented Bible study, and a white-oriented view of
history.
   The Dutch Reformed Church has repudiated its former endorsement
of apartheid, but Roussouw said it would never abandon its support
of Christian National Education.
   ``We sometimes underestimate the power of the school system.''
said du Preez. ``It's a very potent force _ the history courses,
the language, Bible study, praying for the president, raising the
flag.''
   Most Afrikaners in their 20s and 30s sense that black majority
rule is inevitable, du Preez said, but they have deep worries and
uncertainties about how that change will affect them.
   ``I feel so sad as I look at my people _ they're the most unfree
people in this country,'' he said. ``They're resented by everybody
else. They're angry and afraid and confused.''

<HEAD>Documents Unsealed In Rob Lowe Sex Scandal</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with documents showing Lowe's attorneys had

   Rob Lowe's attorneys were trying to reach a
settlement with a teen-ager's mother, who sued the actor after her
daughter appeared in a sexually explicit home video with the ``Brat
Pack'' star, court documents show.
   The attorneys also denied that Lowe tried to seduce the girl,
who was 16 at the time.
   The papers unsealed Wednesday also contend that the teen-ager
planned to blackmail the actor with the videotape showing her
having sex with him, and include affidavits from friends of Lena
Jan Parsons of Marietta that say the teen-ager bragged about having
sex with the 24-year-old actor last summer.
   The documents say the girl intended to use the videotape to
extort $2 million from Lowe.
   The affidavits had been filed in Superior Court in Cobb County
in connection with the divorce of Miss Parsons' parents.
   Lowe asked the court to dismiss the civil lawsuit that Lena
Arlene Wilson filed May 12 on grounds that she lacked standing to
sue since she no longer had legal custody of her daughter after her
divorce.
   A hearing on the motion is scheduled for June 13.
   In one document dated March 30, Lowe's lawyer, Edgar Neely III,
said he asked to view the videotape ``for the purpose of providing
me with sufficient information to advise my client in an attempt to
reach a compromise settlement of Ms. Wilson's claims prior to the
initiation of formal litigation.''
   Fulton District Attorney Lewis Slaton has said he is looking
into the possibility of charging Lowe with exploitation of a minor.
   A document filed in support of Lowe's dismissal motion said,
``The plaintiff's complaint does not allege and Mr. Lowe
specifically denies that he induced plaintiff's daughter to have
sexual intercourse with him.''
   Another document quotes a neighbor, Amanda Hinson, as saying
Miss Parsons told her about the videotape in August.
   ``Jan Parsons came over to my house and told me that she had had
sex with Rob Lowe and to come over and see the videotape of the sex
scene,'' the affidavit read. It also said that ``she was going to
use the film to blackmail Rob Lowe for two million dollars.''
   Another friend, Lela Valerie Smith, was quoted in documents as
saying she ``was told by Jan Parsons that she had had sex with Rob
Lowe. ... and that they all took turns filming each other while
having sex with Mr. Lowe.''
   Miss Parsons, who turned 17 in April, apparently met Lowe at a
local nightclub during last summer's Democratic National Convention.
   Lowe's public relations firm issued a statement late Tuesday
saying Lowe had no comment on the lawsuit ``and he will have no
comment until the matter is resolved.''
   Fulton State Court Judge Frank Hull ordered that divorce case
documents related to the case be released, saying their contents
``have now been widely reported.''
   Television stations that have broadcast edited portions of the
tape have said it depicts the girl and another woman having sex,
with Lowe directing them off camera. The stations say the tape also
contains scenes of the actor and a male companion having sex with a
third woman.
   Slaton said he has not yet requested an appointment with Lowe
but plans to meet with the actor before concluding his criminal
investigation.
   A hearing on motions to dismiss Ms. Wilson's lawsuit against
Lowe is set for June 13.
   Hue Henry, the Athens attorney representing Ms. Wilson, could
not be reached for comment after business hours Wednesday; his
office telephone was answered only with a recording and his home
telephone is unlisted. Ms. Wilson could not be located by telephone.
   But the girl's father told WSB-TV that his daughter never
intended to blackmail Lowe.
   ``No, she would never do something like that. She wouldn't want
to be involved in something like that,'' John C. Parsons said.

   Two people born hours apart died
within 4{ hours of each other in traffic accidents 270 miles apart.
   Jacqueline Johns Wiatrek and Billy Wayne Mutz were born Oct. 7,
1966, in a San Antonio hospital. Their mothers shared a room and
the same doctor handled the deliveries.
   Nineteen years later, they graduated together from Floresville
High School.
   Last weekend, they died.
   Mrs. Wiatrek, 22, and her 29-year-old husband, Richard, were
killed instantly in a head-on collision Saturday evening in the
Dallas suburb of Mesquite.
   Mutz died in a crash 4{ hours later when he lost control of his
pickup on a curving farm road near Floresville, southeast of San
Antonio.
   ``I was taking it so hard, but when I found out that Jacqueline
had died too, it struck me as a sign from God,'' Elizabeth Mutz
said Tuesday after her son was laid to rest in St. Ann's Cemetery
in Kosciusko.
   Funeral services for the Wiatreks were held Wednesday in
Elmendorf.
   Mrs. Wiatrek's mother, Rosie Johns, said she didn't hear about
Mutz's death until Monday.
   ``We went to the funeral home to make arrangements and saw some
of the Mutz family there,'' she said.
   ``I asked ``Who did you lose?' and they said it was Billy
Wayne,'' said Mrs. Johns. ``I said, ``Oh my gosh' and went to hug
his mother. We talked about what happiness we'd both had at the
same time 22 years ago.''
   Mrs. Mutz said the two women had been friends as had their
mothers, but that they'd lost touch with each other until they
arrived in the hospital to deliver their babies.
   ``We hadn't seen each other in a while, and then there we were
having the same doctor deliver our babies on the same day.''

   The left main gear on a Delta 727 en route to
Atlanta collapsed Wednesday as the plane was being towed away from
an airport gate, but officials said there were no injuries among
the 121 people on board.
   The aircraft ``pivoted down'' on the left side, but the nose
gear kept most of the plane upright, said Stapleton International
Airport spokesman Norm Avery.
   The passengers and seven crew members deplaned through the
jetway. There was some damage to the left wingtip, but a report of
other damage was not immediately available, he said.
   The Delta 727-200, was scheduled to depart Stapleton at 8 a.m.
on a nonstop flight to Atlanta, he said.
   The aircraft had received authorization to be pushed back from
its gate when the mishap occurred, Avery said.

<HEAD>Abbie Hoffman's Oldest Son Contemplates Family Business</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEYMOUTH, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since Abbie Hoffman's death last month,
his oldest son has been considering taking over the family
business: agitating.
   Andrew Hoffman, 28, has been living a quiet life here as a
jeweler, photographer, sculptor and carpenter, a self-described
``blue collar jack of all trades.''
   But it might be time for a change.
   ``So many people are wanting me to take on the family business.
But Abbie did a lot of stuff, and he had a lot of help,'' he said.
``We're all feeling a void now. Before, we didn't have to worry
about it, because Abbie was out there doing it.''
   The younger Hoffman has been collecting news clippings about his
father's death, planning memorial services and other benefits.
   He had never sought publicity, but now he's trying to organize
fund-raisers in memory of his father to help causes that had been
backed by the '60s radical.
   Andrew said his first thought after learning of his father's
death was that he had committed suicide, although now he believes
there are too many questions surrounding Hoffman's death.
   The elder Hoffman was found dead in a Bucks County, Pa.,
apartment in March. A medical examiner found he had taken 150
phenobarbital tablets.
   ``The last year or so, he was depressed, and he had tried
suicide before,'' Andrew Hoffman said. ``But he wasn't depressed in
the same way. He was not suicidal. The last conversation I had with
him was very upbeat.''
   Andrew and his sister Ilya are the offspring of Hoffman's first
marriage, which ended in 1966.
   Hoffman left his entire estate to his longtime companion Johanna
Lawrenson. In a 1983 letter to his children, unsealed after his
death, Hoffman tried to explain his will.
   ``I felt what he really meant was that we should carry on, to do
what we find best to do in our hearts. By not leaving us anything
monetary, he was saying, `You have my blood and my spirit, and you
can do great things in this world if you just fight on,''' Andrew
Hoffman said.
   ``That's basically what I'm trying to do.''

<TEXT>
   The University of California at
Berkeley, which for years has tried to come up with an ethnically
fair admissions formula, on Wednesday announced a standard based on
high academic performance regardless of race.
   The proposal represents a move back to admissions based on
academic excellence and away from preferential treatment based on
ethnic background and considerations, said Robert L. Bailey, a
member of the Academic Senate committee that drafted the proposals.
   The changes would restore special considerations for students
eligible for the University of California and are from poor or
uneducated families, a category eliminated in 1984, said sociology
Professor Jerome Karabel, the committee's chairman.
   The number of Berkeley applicants has increased dramatically
since 1981, creating ``ferocious'' competition and giving the
campus a chance to ``attract a student body that is both stronger
academically and diverse socially and economically than ever
before,'' Karabel said.
   The number of applicants for approximately 7,700 offers of
admission at Berkeley increased from 9,006 in 1981 to 22,439 in
1988, according to university figures. Only about 3,400 students
actually enroll. The rest go on to other universities where they
also applied.
   The changes, which will take place by the fall of 1991 if
approved, were made in part because of complaints that current
policies discriminate against Asian-American applicants.
   Changes in 1983-84 withdrew automatic admission for all eligible
students who were also poor, a program that benefited a large
percentage of Asian students, Karabel said.
   Thursday's report ``was issued in the wake of a bitter
controversy on the Berkeley campus over allegations of
discrimination against Asian-Americans, who comprise about 26
percent of undergraduates,'' Karabel said.
   Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman and the Asian American
Task Force on University of California Admissions issued a joint
statement in March that said policies adopted in 1983-84 were
unfair.
   Under the new proposal, which must still be approved by the
administration, the proportion of freshmen admitted on the basis of
outstanding academic records alone would be increased from 40
percent to 50 percent.
   This will ensure that all students with good enough high school
records to place them in the top half of Berkeley's entering class
will be accepted, the committee said.
   In California, 32.8 percent of Asian high school graduates meet
UC eligibility requirements, compared to 15.8 percent of whites and
5 percent of Hispanics and 4.5 percent of blacks.
   Another 45 percent of the freshmen would be selected from among
groups given ``special consideration.'' All of these students will
have met academic standards for UC admission, placing them in the
top eighth of the state's graduating high school seniors.
   The changes would add a category of ``socioeconomically
disadvantaged'' to this group, which already includes
underrepresented minorities on campus _ blacks, Hispanics and
Indians _ as well as outstanding athletes and the disabled.
Re-entry applicants, typically older women, would also be given
special consideration.
   ``There will be more disadvantaged white and Asian students on
the campus,'' Karabel said.
   The addition of the economic disadvantage category is ``in
addition to affirmative action (based on race) not in place of it''
and will not lower the number of underrepresented minorities on
campus, he said.
   The remaining 5 percent accepted would be filled by ``special
admission'' students, who do not meet admission standards but are
accepted because their racial or economic background placed them at
a disadvantage or because they have special talents, such as
athletic or artistic achievements. Berkeley currently admits 6
percent of its freshmen on this basis.

<HEAD>Early Menopause May Signal Body Aging Faster, Study Suggests</HEAD>

   A woman's age at natural menopause may be an
indicator of her body's aging rate and general health, according to
a study that suggests women reaching menopause before age 45 may
tend to die earlier.
   Early natural menopause may signal that the body is aging faster
than normal, said co-author David Snowdon of the University of
Minnesota.
   He and colleagues from the university and Loma Linda University
in California presented the work in June's American Journal of
Public Health.
   Other scientists called the work interesting, but cautioned that
its conclusions are limited because of the study's methods.
   Menopause, when a woman permanently stops menstruating,
generally occurs around age 50.
   The study was conducted on 5,287 white Seventh Day Adventists
who had experienced natural menopause. They filled out
questionnaires in 1976, when they were ages 55 to 100. Of this
group, 663 reached menopause before age 45.
   Six years later, 772 of the women had died from a variety of
causes, including 139 who had menopause before age 45.
   Women whose menopause had occurred before age 40 showed a 95
percent higher risk of dying during the six years of the study than
did women of similar ages whose menopause came at ages 50 to 54.
   For women who had reported menopause at ages 40 to 44, the risk
was 39 percent higher.
   In contrast, no relationship between age at menopause and death
appeared in 3,166 other Seventh Day Adventists whose menopause was
caused by surgery.
   Previous studies have suggested that loss of estrogen production
at menopause puts women at increased risk of heart disease. But the
new study found that replacing estrogen did not increase longevity,
as well as the finding that surgical menopause did not show the
link to death that natural menopause did.
   That suggests that something other than loss of estrogen caused
the mortality differences, Snowdon said.
   The study is ``the sort of thing you cannot dismiss,'' said
Robert N. Butler, chairman of the department of geriatrics and
adult development at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. ``I
certainly take it seriously.''
   But he said similar research should be conducted in other
population groups to see if results apply to other women. In
addition, he said, the study relied on the women's memory of when
menopause occurred, which may have been faulty.
   Many women do not precisely recall that age, said Toni Miles,
assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois
at Chicago. She also questioned whether results from Seventh Day
Adventists, who generally avoid smoking and drinking alcohol, would
apply to others.
   If researchers had asked why the women experienced early natural
menopause, it might have revealed diseases that could explain their
earlier deaths, said menopause expert Morris Notelovitz, director
of the Women's Medical and Diagnostic Center in Gainesville, Fla.
   He also said the study runs against previous research that
showed women with early menopause can be protected against heart
disease by taking estrogen treatments. The new results should not
discourage use of the treatments, he said.

   The massive protests for a freer China have
prompted an identity crisis at the People's Liberation Army: Is it
an army serving the people or just those in power?
   The PLA was the military force that swept the Communists to
power in 1949, establishing along the way a reputation of devotion
to China's peasant masses.
   In a country where armies often have attracted riffraff
interested primarily in rape and plunder, the army of revolutionary
leader Mao Tse-tung went to great effort to serve the people and
treat them decently.
   The army's Eight Points for Attention include: fair pay for
purchases, the return of all borrowed items, no hitting or
swearing, no damage to crops and no liberties with women.
   That attitude won over millions of people to the Communist
cause, and the image of servant to the masses is still nurtured by
the army.
   ``The People's Army loves the people,'' has been a refrain from
soldiers and Beijing residents alike since troops were sent to
restore order in the capital, where more than 1 million people have
demonstrated for a more democratic society, press freedom and an
end to official corruption.
   But the PLA, which has about 3.2 million soldiers, also has
shown loyalty to individual leaders, first Mao and now 84-year-old
senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is thought to be the main force
behind the hard-line stance against student demonstrators.
   The argument by Deng and his followers that a crackdown on
pro-democracy students occupying Tiananmen Square in central
Beijing is necessary to restore order strikes a responsive chord
among many military leaders.
   The problem, however, is that the people of Beijing and other
major Chinese cities have taken to the streets daily to support the
Tiananmen students and demand the ouster of Premier Li Peng, the
most vocal champion of a crackdown.
   That outpouring of support for student activists cannot be
ignored by an army that prides itself as being of the people.
   Indications are that a split has developed among the military
over how to proceed.
   On Monday, more than 100 senior military officers signed a
letter opposing Li's declaration of martial law in Beijing, saying
the PLA ``will never shoot the people.''
   Former Defense Minister Zhang Aiping and former PLA Chief of
Staff Yang Dezhi were among those who wrote the letter, according
to a source at the People's Daily.
   The same day, however, the top army command signed a letter
supporting Li's imposition of martial law in Beijing on Saturday.
It said ``an extreme minority of people are fanning the flames,
creating turmoil, with the goal of negating the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party and the socialist system.''
   Caught in the middle are the thousands of soldiers sent to
Beijing to restore order. Many were deployed on the city's
outskirts for several days, the road to Tiananmen blocked by tens
of thousands of residents, before retreating to nearby barracks.
   During the standoff, the soldiers were befriended by the people
of Beijing. The young soldiers were fed, entertained, lectured,
and, most importantly, admonished by students and grandparents
alike not to attack the protesters.
   Some soldiers clearly were moved.

   A fire destroyed the vacant Pan Pacific
Auditorium on Wednesday night in a spectacular sunset blaze that
sent a column of black smoke more than 1,000 feet into the air that
was visible at least 35 miles away.
   ``The entire structure is engulfed,'' said Fire Department
spokesman Jim Williamson.
   Fire officials said the fire might have been sparked by
transients at the huge, art deco-style sports arena and exhibition
hall five miles west of downtown.
   Flames burned through the roof of the building, which was built
during the Depression by the Works Project Administration and
provided a stage for such performers as Sonja Henie and Elvis
Presley.
   ``There's not gonna be much left, if they ever put it out,''
said Elsie Cutler, who watched as 150 firefighters battled the
blaze.
   Flames shot more than 100 feet into the air, and the smoke was
visible in Malibu 35 miles west of downtown, witnesses said.
   The fire was reported shortly after 7 p.m., Williamson said.
   Firefighters dumped water on the blaze from three-story-high
elevated cranes.
   ``The roof is pretty much gone,'' said Deputy Fire Chief Greg
Drummond.
   Drummond said the fire appeared to have broken out in the
southwest corner of the 150-foot-by-300-foot building and quickly
spread through the structure.
   Assistant Fire Chief Tony Ennis said he doubted the building
could be salvaged.
   ``I think it could be arson,'' Ennis said. ``But it will be
several days before we determine that.''

<HEAD>Student Speed: 4,300 Students Study Physics at Amusement Park</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANDUSKY, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 4,000 students outfitted with a
map of an amusement park, a few instruments and a questionnaire
spent a day riding roller coasters and other contraptions to learn
more about physics.
   Students from Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan participated in
the Cedar Point amusement park's fourth annual Physics Day.
   Tuesday's event allowed students to experience some of the
concepts they are studying, including gravity, acceleration, and
centrifugal force.
   ``The rides show how our physics equations relate to real
life,'' said Andre Takacs, an eighth grader from Midview Junior
High School in Lorain County. ``If it wasn't for physics, there
wouldn't be roller coasters.''
   Some answers were harder to obtain than others because rain kept
many rides closed.
   ``It would be a lot easier to measure the speed of the Blue
Streak (roller coaster) if I was on it,'' said Angela Kabasan of
Midview.
   Instead of wondering whether they could scream the loudest and
raise their arms on the downhill, students were busy figuring the
gravitational pull exerted on them by the new Magnum XL-200, which
the park bills as the world's tallest, fastest roller coaster.
   Physics Day has been recognized as a valid educational activity
by the American Association of Physics Teachers, said Robert
Speers, an associate professor at Firelands College and originator
of the Physics Day program.

   A woman who said ``I do'' after partying
for 12 hours wants the Las Vegas marriage annulled because neither
she nor the groom realized the ceremony was legitimate.
   Kimberly Lorna Scott, 21, who is from Boulder, filed a motion in
District Court on Tuesday seeking to annul her Dec. 17 marriage to
Michael Shawn Dalzell, 22, of Anchorage, Alaska.
   ``No toaster ovens here,'' Scott said jokingly by telephone from
Alabama, where Dalzell is a student at the University of Alabama.
``It was just a joke, an accident, and we didn't think it was
real.''
   The two college students exchanged wedding vows at the Little
White Chapel after they spent nearly 12 hours consuming alcohol and
wandering along the popular Las Vegas strip of hotels and casinos,
Scott said in an affidavit that accompanied the motion.
   Scott and Dalzell decided to ``get a Las Vegas marriage just to
see what it was like, not realizing that it would be as valid as a
marriage performed anywhere else,'' according to the motion.
   Shortly after the ceremony, the two parted company, but after
they received a Social Security name change request form they
realized the marriage was legal, the motion said.
   ``It was sort of a slight panic, maybe shock,'' Dalzell said.

   New Yorkers are used to standing in lines. There
are lines for Broadway tickets, lines for movies and even lines for
trendy restaurants.
   But lines for bread?
   Residents formed bread lines on Wednesday to buy loaves of real
Russian rye flown in from the Soviet Union.
   ``We're selling it at a rate of one loaf every two minutes;
right now, the line is very long,'' said Miraed Peake Smith,
spokeswoman for Bloomingdale's, where 1,100 loaves arrived Tuesday
night.
   ``One person came in and bought 14 loaves,'' she said. Among the
buyers were employees from the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
   ``The bread is good. It's not a gimmick,'' Ms. Smith said. ``But
Americans also seem to be fascinated with Russian items.''
   Yes, but they're still Americans, and any resemblance to Moscow
ends at the rear of the line. Competition broke out before the
bread had even arrived in the United States, and a bakery chain is
already planning to undercut Bloomingdale's price _ a hefty $6 for
each two-pound loaf.
   The dense bread was made in Moscow on Sunday, shipped Sunday
night, arrived Monday via Aeroflot, uderwent federal inspections
and was delivered to Bloomingdale's on Tuesday.

   The new gnu is good news.
   The herd of 15 large African antelopes at International Wildlife
Park should soon increase by more than 50 percent with the
pitter-patter of little hooves.
   Terrie Gonzalez, a spokeswoman for the drive-through park, said
zoo officials were worried about the condition of eight pregnant
gnus that were displaced following a flood at the park. But park
officials examined them and said they are doing fine even though
they were evacuated from their normal range.
   The damage from last week's heavy rain has kept the park closed
for more than week.
   An adult male gnu was swept away by the high water and died.
   But park officials expect new gnus soon and already have a
``gnumber of gnames.''
   Following a 3-year-old park tradition, all gnus are given common
names beginning with an ``n,'' with a ``g'' added in front.
   ``We already have a short list,'' Gonzalez said. ``Some of the
names we have are Gnixon, Gned, Gnatalie, Gnancy and Gnat.''

   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said in
long-awaited testimony to Parliament Thursday that he is ``totally
innocent'' of opposition charges that he was linked to the Recruit
influence-peddling scandal.
   Nakasone spoke under oath in the Budget Committee of the House
of Representatives, and his words were broadcast live nationwide
though with only a still photo. By law live television broadcasts
are banned from testimony of special witnesses in Parliament.
   ``I am totally innocent,'' the former prime minster said in his
opening statement. ``I refused to testify earlier because I have
never done anything wrong.''
   After his statement, he faced questioning by opposition parties
that was to continue for over two hours.
   Meanwhile, support for the governing Liberal Democratic Party
appeared at an all-time low.
   According to a survey of 2,280 eligible voters conducted May
20-21 by the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbum, support for the
Liberal Democrats stands at just 26.5 percent, the lowest since its
founding in 1955, while combined support for five opposition
parties stands at 26.7 percent. The survey said 44.1 percent of
those polled supported no party.
   ``We hope that this testimony before Parliament will not be the
end of the matter,'' and that Nakasone ``will resign from
Parliament and maybe take some others with him,'' said Seiji
Masamori of the Communist Party.
   Masamori and four other opposition lawmakers questioned Nakasone
in a session scheduled to last 2 hours, 20 minutes, with the time
given each determined by his party's number of seats. The committee
chairman, of the governing Liberal Democrats, also was to be
allowed time for questions.
   For months, the opposition has demanded testimony in Parliament
from Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of dubious stock
deals and large contributions to politicians by the Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate.
   The Liberal Democrats refused until last week, calling the
demands ``improper'' because of Nakasone's status as a former prime
minister.
   A long opposition boycott of debate on the budget finally
changed that.
   Liberal Democrats forced the budget through the House of
Representatives last month, but widespread criticism resulted and a
deal was made: The opposition would not boycott the budget in the
upper house if Nakasone testified before the budget committee.
   Prosecutors have arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen so far
on charges involving bribery and violations of securities laws, and
have filed charges aginst two members of Parliament.
   Recruit sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to scores of people
prominent in government and business, including at least 17
politicians or their aides. The buyers made large profits when the
shares went on public sale.
   Eleven of the 17 were members of Nakasone's Cabinet, and
opposition leaders claim he was a central figure in the scandal.
Nakasone, prime minister in 1983-87, has acknowledged his aides
bought 29,000 shares and said the profits were used for political
activities.
   One of the lawmakers against whom bribery charges were filed
Monday was Takao Fujinami, a Nakasone lieutenant and former chief
Cabinet secretary.
   Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, Nakasone's finance minister and
successor, has said he will resign to take responsibility for the
Recruit scandal.
   National newspapers reported last weekend that Nakasone would
resign from Parliament, but an official of his party faction said
privately: ``There is no truth to the reports. Mr. Nakasone said he
inends to continue as a legislator, although in the face of
adversity.''
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Socialist Party, the
largest opposition group, has accused Nakasone of doing Recruit a
special favor that involved ordering Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Co. and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to buy
multimillion-dollar U.S. supercomputers.
   Two of the supercomputers made by Cray Research Inc. were resold
to Recruit and helped establish it in leasing computer time and
related telecommunications services.
   Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which was a government monopoly until 1985, was arrested
and accused of taking bribes from Recruit in the form of the
bargain stock shares.
   The opposition also wants to know whether Nakasone recommended
Hiromasa Ezoe, founder and former chairman of Recruit, for
membership on several government advisory committees.

   Yang Zhisheng wakes up each morning and stands
facing the sun atop the commandeered public bus that is his
temporary home, playing his accordion.
   Nearby, a sea of ramshackle tents and campsites stretches across
Tiananmen Square.
   A makeshift tent city has sprung up on the 100-acre square,
where about 30,000 students leading a civil uprising for democratic
reforms and an end to official corruption have camped out for the
past 13 days.
   ``It's great, I like sleeping on top of this bus,'' said Yang, a
junior from Inner Mongolia studying management at Beijing
University of Science and Technology. ``It's quite comfortable up
here.''
   More than 100 buses are lined up at the north end of the square,
under the gaze of a portrait of Mao Tse-tung, Communist China's
founder. Students clamber to their lofty beds through windows and
air vents, and hop from roof to roof to get around, while others
bunk out underneath the big rigs.
   Hundreds of scarlet flags flutter above the squatters and from
buses, which are plastered with slogans such as ``1.1 billion
hearts are bleeding.''
   This city within a square has roads, food depots, clinics and
its own radio station, actually a network of loudspeakers. Its
leaders are sequestered at the two-tiered Monument to the People's
Heroes, surrounded by three cordons of student security guards.
   Those who built it are their own government and their own police.
   Only students, journalists, medical personnel and those
delivering food are allowed in and the student guards demand
identification at every checkpoint.
   During the day the students take turns guarding Tiananmen's
perimeter or defending the square from soldiers who might be sent
to disperse them.
   Premier Li Peng on Saturday declared martial law in Beijing and
ordered in soldiers to restore order. In response, city residents
blocked major roads with barricades and the soldiers have yet to
come.
   ``It's really tough. The government cut off the water at the
square and won't let some hospitals deliver medicine,'' said a
sophomore from Shenzhen University, 1,300 miles south of Beijing.
   Duan Bin, a junior from far western Xinjiang province who
studies at Beijing Forestry College gestured around a bus provided
by sympathetic transport workers. ``The people of Beijing donated
everything to us, blankets, mattresses, food, clothing,
cigarettes.''
   Two buses _ set apart from the others _ are used as toilets.
They reek and leak onto the square.
   First aid stations are on the road in front of the Museum of
History on Tiananmen's east side. A week ago the street was
screaming with ambulances taking away hunger strikers every two to
three minutes, leading students to nickname the alley `The
Lifeline.'''
   These days the clinics treat students mainly for colds, sore
throats, diarrhea and sunstroke, said a volunteer doctor from
Beijing Union Medical College.
   ``I've only slept two or three hours a day for the last week,''
the doctor said. ``I work overnight at the hospital and donate my
days to the students.''
   The borders around Tiananmen abound with merchants, marchers and
moochers. Popsicle and soda pop vendors do a booming business and
do not charge students. Others hawk watermelons, hardboiled eggs
and Chinese crepes while couples picnic in the reviewing stands
next to the balcony from where Mao declared the foundation of the
People's Republic of China in 1949.
   A rainstorm on Tuesday scattered hundreds of thousands of
supporters. About 5,000 spent the night jammed into two underground
passageways out of the square, turning them into anthills of
humanity.
   The biggest question is how long the squatters will remain. The
student-run radio has told them to stay until the unpopular Li is
gone. But some maintain the students have sown enough confusion in
the party and military that they can leave in glory.
   After a tense weekend when the students and citizenry of Beijing
were convinced they would be attacked by the People's Liberation
Army, fears have abated that military might raze the tent city.
   Despite the martial law decree, the only soldiers in sight are
two honor guards at Tiananmen's flagpole, their holsters empty.
   ``The army's not here, so how can this be martial law?'' asked
Yang, the accordionist. ``We're not afraid. The people of Beijing
will keep them out.''

   The Senate returns from its Memorial Day
recess next week to tackle a pair of bills that fund federal
efforts against drug dealers and help financially ailing veterans
programs.
   The House on Wednesday approved a $3.7 billion domestic spending
bill that would pour an additional $822 million into the
government's anti-drug initiatives in 1989.
   The chamber approved the measure 227-197 on a party-line vote
after majority Democrats beat back repeated Republican attempts to
reject it.
   GOP lawmakers found themselves boxed into voting against beefing
up federal drug efforts because the Bush administration opposed the
measure, arguing that it would supply more money than the
authorities need.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., called the
legislation and another Democratic anti-drug proposal that was
defeated ``a two-headed malodorous swamp animal.'' He complained
that the money in the so-called dire emergency spending bill _
intended for drug efforts and other domestic programs _ was ``no
more a dire emergency than the distinguished chairman's dry
cleaning.''
   But Democrats, who argued that the drug problem affects
everyone, prevailed.
   ``You can't walk the streets in Washington or any rural
community in safety today,'' said House Appropriations Committee
Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.
   The White House has threatened to veto the measure because of
its anti-drug component.
   In a statement delivered to lawmakers Tuesday, the Office of
Management and Budget noted Bush's desire to battle illegal drugs
but warned, ``This commitment does not mean, though, that the
president will forgo the war against the deficit.''
   The measure now moves to the Senate, where senators have
indicated a desire to tack on their favorite programs. The Senate
returns from its Memorial Day recess on Wednesday.
   On a narrow 213-205 tally, the House turned down a separate bill
championed by liberal Democrats that would have siphoned money next
year from Star Wars research to drug programs. The measure would
have frozen spending for the proposed anti-missile defense system
in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, to the same $3.7 billion level
of this year. Money provided by Congress above that cap would have
automatically been transferred to anti-drug initiatives.
   The $822 million would be spent for building and modernizing
prisons, hiring additional law enforcement officers and other
drug-related pursuits.
   Other funds in the bill include $1.2 billion for veterans, $893
million for the Guaranteed Student Loan program for college
students, $423 million for state foster care efforts and $88
million for public housing.
   A $4.7 billion version of the bill failed to garner House
approval on April 26, when legislators rejected a Democratic plan
to pay for the measure by cutting other programs by 0.57 percent.
   The House also voted 409-0 to reaffirm its support for a
separate bill providing $1.2 billion for health programs,
cost-of-living benefit increases, and other programs for veterans.
   The House initially approved that bill last Thursday. That same
evening, the Senate passed the same bill after limiting its
spending to about $75 million, enough to see the Department of
Veterans Affairs through June 15.
   By creating a need for a later, second bill to finance the
department, the Senate left a vehicle onto which it could attach
pet projects of its own.
   ``The Senate won't release the veterans as hostages,'' lamented
Silvio Conte of Massachusetts, ranking Republican on the House
Appropriations Committee.

<HEAD>Report: US Supplied Weapons, then Sent Help for Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States gave Somalia weapons which
were used to crush an insurgency. Then it turned around and sent
emergency assistance to patch up the victims.
   Those are the findings of a report by the congressional General
Accounting Office, which sent a team to Somalia to investigate
allegations of serious human rights abuses and to find out whether
U.S. aid was used last year against rebels retaliating for the
abuses.
   The U.S. shipment of 1,200 M-16 automatic rifles and more than 2
million rounds of ammunition was authorized in November 1986 as
part of a military aid package to the strategically located African
country on the shores of the Red Sea.
   But for technical reasons, the delivery did not get to Somalia
until June 28, 1988, the report found. It was immediately trucked
to Hargeisa, a town that government troops were trying to retake
from the rebels, according to the GAO, the watchdog agency of
Congress.
   ``A senior Somali military official confirmed that the U.S.
equipment was distributed to troops in the north and was used
during the conflict,'' the report said.
   The Somali military also ``resorted to using artillery and
aerial shelling in heavily populated urban centers,'' and about 70
percent of Hargeisa was damaged or destroyed, the team found.
   ``Starting in August 1988, the U.S. government responded to the
emergency with $1.9 million in disaster assistance to help the
victims of the conflict,'' said the report. The assistance included
a field hospital unit, plastic sheeting, blankets and food staples,
it said.
   The use of the arms to crush the rebel Somali National Movement
prompted the administration to suspend further weapons deliveries.
   Since then, the administration has ``voluntarily limited the
military assistance programs to nonlethal items, including spare
parts for previously supplied weapons,'' the report said.
   State Department officials say the United States has stopped
deliveries in order to encourage the government to negotiate a
peace agreement with the SNM.
   Although the government has responded to U.S. pressure and
released more than 300 political prisoners in recent months, no
progress has been made toward talks with the SNM, partly through
the rebels' fault.
   The curbs on U.S. aid are straining ties with the Somali
government at a time when the United States seeks to renegotiate an
agreement for use of the Berbera port on the Red Sea. Under an
existing agreement, which is up for renewal next year, Berbera is
used by U.S. ships going to and from the Indian Ocean.
   The fighting between the government and the SNM began in May
1988, when the rebels retaliated against government abuse of rebel
sympathizers by attacking officials in Hargeisa and Burao and
taking over the towns. As a result of the fighting, 350,000 people
fled to neighboring Ethiopia.
   ``A majority of the refugees we interviewed stated that their
homes were destroyed by shelling despite the absence of SNM
combatants from their neighborhoods,'' the report said. The
refugees also described looting, jailing, beating and rapes by
government soldiers prior to the conflict, the report said.

   The Robert Morris College campus,
including its fabled ``kissing rock,'' is for sale again after
school trustees rejected the only bid made at last week's auction.
   But school officials are still hopeful they can negotiate a deal
with the spurned bidder, who offered $400,000.
   ``The board simply felt the bid was not right,'' Michael Viollt,
the school's vice president for financial affairs, said Wednesday.
``Instead, the board proposed terms which would be acceptable and
submitted that to the bidder.''
   The College Education Foundation, a non-profit association of a
dozen Carthage-area businesses, bid for the 20-acre campus, which
includes 484 dormitory rooms, four classroom buildings, a library,
gym and even the ``kissing rock,'' which fokelore says will bring a
kiss to whoever sits on it.
   ``I thought we were safe, since $400,000 was the suggested
opening bid. But sometimes in business deals you have offers and
counteroffers,'' said Terry Newell, the foundation's president.
   Newell said the school's trustees suggested the campus should go
for slightly less than $2 million.
   ``I don't think it's outrageous,'' Newell said. ``But I've got
to get together with the foundation board and we'll decide what to
do.''
   The college estimates the campus is worth $11 million.
   ``This is a steal at $400,000,'' college President Richard
Pickett said after last Thursday's auction.
   Residents were stunned in December when the college said it was
abandoning this rural, western Illinois town of 3,000 and moving
the school's headquarters to Chicago, 260 miles to the northeast.
   The school is one of the town's largest employers with 110
faculty and staff and about 370 students.
   Robert Morris College opened 24 years ago as a business school.
   Last spring, the college opened a new campus in Springfield,
where it has about 170 students. About 1,350 students attend in
Chicago.

<HEAD>Bush Plan For New Nuclear Weapons Plants Draws Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is coming under
increasing attack for its plan to build new military reactors in
South Carolina and Idaho that could provide far more material for
nuclear warheads than the Pentagon says it will need.
   The latest barrage of criticism comes from the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. It said
Wednesday that lawmakers were given inaccurate and incomplete
information about key elements of the plan to build reactors in
South Carolina and Idaho.
   The GAO also questioned whether it was necessary to build the
reactors, which the Energy Department says would provide 150
percent of the anticipated need for tritium, a radioactive gas used
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   The administration wants to build one reactor at the federal
Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., and another at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. It says they
could be built within 10 years for $6.8 billion.
   The main reason for constructing new reactors is that the only
existing ones capable of producing tritium _ all situated at the
Savannah River Site _ are shut down for repairs and safety
improvements until sometime next year. They are 35 years old and
not expected to run more than another 15 years.
   Ronald W. Cochran, the Energy Department official in charge of
the new reactor program, told a special panel of the House Armed
Services Committee on Wednesday that the tritium supply outlook was
``a major national security issue.''
   ``A crisis is at hand,'' Robert B. Barker, the defense
secretary's top adviser on nuclear energy, told the panel in a
written statement. ``Without a source of new tritium ... unilateral
disarmament is inevitable.''
   Prominent U.S. scientists, however, have cast doubt on the claim
that failure to resume tritium production in the next several years
would hurt U.S. security.
   Carson Mark, a former atomic bomb designer, told the panel
Tuesday that Congress should put off deciding whether to finance
the construction of the two new reactors. He said the United States
already has more than enough tritium in hand to maintain its
existing stockpile of approximately 23,000 nuclear weapons.
   Mark said the improved outlook for substantial new reductions in
U.S. and Soviet nuclear arsenals could eliminate the need for new
tritium-production reactors.
   He and other scientists have urged the administration to take
advantage of the forced suspension of U.S. tritium production to
propose a mutual U.S.-Soviet production ban.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins and other administration
officials have sought to persuade Congress that an improved
capability to make tritium is vital to U.S. security because there
is no immediate prospect for complete disarmament.
   Watkins has acknowledged that two new reactors, as envisioned by
the administration's plan, would provide more tritium production
capacity than is needed. But he said this would provide insurance
against possible mechanical failures or other problems such as the
safety questions raised about the existing older reactors.
   J. Dexter Peach, an assistant GAO comptroller general, said the
administration needs to take a closer look at the budget
implications of the two-reactor approach. He noted that the Energy
Department already faces a daunting task in finding an estimated
$100 billion or more to clean up the environmental damage caused by
40 years of nuclear weapons production at existing sites.
   Peach said the Energy Department, in its August 1988 report to
Congress on the new reactor plan, had inaccurately estimated the
costs involved and the amount of time it would take to get the
reactors running. Peach did not give his own cost estimate but said
the 10-year construction schedule was at least 2{ years too short.

   To get to Tiananmen Square, Ji Xiujie took three
trains, blocked railroad tracks for hours with his classmates,
bounced along in a bus and threatened a police officer with a
beating.
   But the student from Chongqing, an industrial city about 1,100
miles from Beijing, finally made it to the heart of China's
month-long student movement for freedom.
   ``I will tell my children about this with pride,'' said the
20-year-old junior from Chongqing University surrounded by his
classmates under a makeshift styrofoam tent. ``I have come to
Beijing to take part in a great revolution.''
   Ji is one of tens of thousands of students from outside Beijing
who made the long march to the capital to demonstrate for a more
democratic China and the resignation of Premier Li Peng and senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   The students' presence in Beijing has given the movement a boost
now that thousands of others in the capital have retuned to their
schools, exhausted after sleeping for 10 days on concrete.
   Indeed, the out-of-towners now make up more than half of the
students on the square, student leaders say.
   Many traveled across the country for free because train clerks
and ticket sellers also support the movement. Now they live on the
good graces of Beijing residents who bring them noodles and steamed
bread, and man the blockades keeping army troops out of the city.
   Their travels have echoes in China's recent past. During the
ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, hundreds of thousands of
students took to the road to visit the revolutionary sites. For
many, the experiences on the road as Red Guards were formative ones.
   For Ji, his travels to Beijing play the same role.
   Ji and about 30 classmates started their trek to Beijing on
Friday night, a day before Premier Li Peng ordered a martial law
crackdown in Beijing to suppress the movement.
   ``By the time we left there was a news blackout on the movement
throughout all of China,'' Ji said. ``We just had to know what was
going on.''
   On Sunday, they arrived in Loyang in Henan province, but police
on orders to keep protesters from coming to Beijing forced them
onto a train returning to Chongqing.
   They got off a few stops later and rented a mini-bus to head
back to Loyang to get a train to Beijing.
   ``A police officer came to the bus station and said we couldn't
go,'' Ji said. ``We pleaded with him but he refused to give in.''
   Finally, the Sichuan students threatened him with a thrashing
and he let them go. ``That was very satisfying,'' Shi Zhifen, a
Sichuan classmate, said with a smile.
   In Loyang, they boarded another train, but it was stopped in
Anyang, another Henan city.
   ``Police threw all the students off,'' said Ji.
   Thousands of students then began a demonstration in the station,
lying on the railroad tracks for seven hours until just before dawn
Sunday. The railroad office relented.
   ``We had shut down the whole railyard. There was nothing they
could do,'' Ji said.
   The band arrived victoriously in Beijing on Monday.
   ``I haven't taken off my clothes in five days,'' Ji said as he
batted at a fly under the styrofoam roof. ``But my spirit is
strong. We will stay here until the government falls.''
   Qian Jin and her classmates from Yunnan University didn't have
any problems traveling from Kunming, capital of faraway Yunnan
province, until they neared Beijing.
   ``We heard rumors that police were throwing students off trains
at the next station,'' said the 21-year-old senior, her face burned
by the sun. ``So we got off and started to walk.''
   A day later, on Tuesday, they arrived in the city.
   ``My feet are still blistered,'' the English major said as she
sat under a 3-foot-high tent. ``But I am proud to be here.''
   Bao Shu from Qingdao, on the Pacific coast, remembered the tales
his father told of his days as traveling Red Guard during the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   ``He covered the whole country,'' said the 18-year-old student
from Ocean University. ``He met my mother on the road, too.''
   Although Bao's ideals are different from those of his parents,
who at the time sought a radically communist society, he said he
understands the excitement they felt.
   ``Coming here I felt for the first time that China has hope,''
he said. ``I know what my parents felt then.''

   As quickly as rumors began sweeping the
Capitol that Jim Wright might soon step down as House speaker, they
were followed by speculation on the fights likely to ensue over
Democratic leadership posts.
   At least nine names, led by Majority Leader Tom Foley of
Washington, were mentioned Wednesday as various scenarios emerged
for how the Wright succession could play out.
   Foley was regarded as the overwhelming favorite to become
speaker should Wright step down. But potentially tough fights could
emerge for the posts of majority leader and majority whip.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley,'' said Rep.
Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   ``I don't think the Angel Gabriel could beat Tom Foley,'' said
another congressman who insisted on anonymity.
   But that didn't halt speculation that a ``clean sweep'' slate
would emerge to challenge all the incumbent members of the
Democratic leadership.
   Under that scenario, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri would run
for speaker. Joining him on a slate would be Rep. Ed Jenkins of
Georgia as a candidate for majority leader, and Rep. Bill Gray of
Pennsylvania, currently chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and
the only black mentioned as a candidate for a top leadership post,
for majority whip.
   Other names mentioned were Rep. Beryl Anthony of Arkansas,
chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee; Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois, Ways and Means committee chairman; Rep.
John Dingell of Michigan, chairman of the Energy and Commerce
committee, and Rep. Mike Synar of Oklahoma.
   One rumor was that Wright would announce his resignation
effective next Wednesday and even that timing was considered
significant in any leadership fight.
   The next meeting of the Democratic Caucus is scheduled for
Wednesday and if that is the day Wright steps down, the assembled
Democrats would vote that day for their choices for the leadership
posts.
   The theory was that a quick vote would favor incumbent
leadership figures such as Foley and Rep. Tony Coelho of
California, the Democratic whip. Challengers would have little
chance to round up support because most House members would be
scattered across the country for the long Memorial Day weekend.
   But Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House leadership,
has ethics problems of his own. The congressman has acknowledged
that he failed to disclose a $50,000 loan from a savings and loan
in California that he used toward purchase of $100,000 worth of
junk bonds.
   Despite that, Coelho was regarded as likely to bid for the
majority leader's post. He might face a challenge even if he opted
to remain as whip.
   Gephardt was considered more likely to challenge Coelho for
majority leader than to oppose Foley for the speakership.
   Dingell said he expected Foley to run for speaker ``and I expect
to support him.'' If for any reason, Foley decided against trying
to succeed Wright, Dingell said he would ``consider my own
options.''
   Rostenkowski was described by House sources, who declined to
speak for attribution, as content to remain as head of the Ways and
Means committee, but also interested in blocking Foley's accession
to the speakership.
   Jenkins was a favorite of many Southerners who were concerned
that Wright's resignation would leave their region without anyone
in the leadership.
   Jenkins also is closely tied to Rostenkowski.
   ``There is talk about succession and how you do it,'' said
Williams. ``If the speaker resigns, the House is then faced with a
vacancy in the person third in line to be president. We must move
quickly.''

   A federal judge refused to continue an
injunction that banned herbicide use on national forests in Oregon
and Washington, allowing the use of 13 chemicals on Pacific
Northwest timberland.
   District Judge James M. Burns' order Wednesday affects U.S.
Forest Service land. U.S. Bureau of Land Management timberland in
the region remains under the injunction.
   A legal dispute began in 1983 when the Northwest Coalition for
Alternatives to Pesticides and other groups filed a lawsuit
claiming herbicide spraying practices violated federal
environmental laws.
   The order includes a mediated agreement that spells out how the
Forest Service will implement its 1988 environmental impact
statement on controlling unwanted vegetation on land it manages.
   Herbicides are sprayed on timberlands in the Pacific Northwest
to control competing vegetation that might otherwise overwhelm
newly planted Douglas fir seedlings.
   Mary O'Brien of the Northwest Coalition said conservation groups
were satisfied with the mediated settlement because it makes it
clear alternatives will be tried before herbicides are applied.
   O'Brien said the agreement calls for the Forest Service to
stress prevention of vegetation management problems in developing
plans for harvesting timber. Each project will be analyzed and the
public will have a chance to comment before any treatment method,
including herbicides, is used.
   She said the Forest Service also had agreed to look into what
happens when vegetation treated with certain herbicides is burned.
   Michael Ferris, a Forest Service spokesman, said the process of
analzying and taking comment on potential spraying projects meant
that it would be months before herbicides are actually applied to
forest lands.
   ``I don't think we'll see anything before next year,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cholesterol Particle May Encourage Heart Attacks By Promoting Clots</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A cholesterol-carrying particle in the blood may
encourage heart attacks by hampering the body's ability to destroy
blood clots, researchers reported today.
   Two teams of scientists found that in the test tube, the
particle known as lipoprotein (a) interfered with a key step in
clot destruction.
   Clots trigger heart attacks by plugging narrowed arteries, and
one researcher said they may encourage the narrowing of the
arteries in the first place.
   The studies appear in today's issue of the British journal
Nature.
   Lipoprotein (a) resembles the better-known low-density
lipoprotein, the so-called ``bad cholesterol'' that contributes to
atherosclerosis, the buildup of material on artery walls. The
buildup narrows the vessels and sets the stage for heart attacks.
   Lipoprotein (a) also is associated with atherosclerosis and
heart attacks, scientists from the Research Institute of Scripps
Clinic in La Jolla, Calif., and the University of Chicago noted in
their Nature report.
   They followed up on the earlier discovery that one component of
the lipoprotein (a) particle strongly resembles a blood protein
called plasminogen.
   Plasminogen plays a key role in the destruction of blood clots,
once it binds to other proteins called receptors. The receptors
appear on blood cells and the lining of blood vessels.
   Researchers found that in the test tube, lipoprotein (a) also
bound to those receptors, interfering with the plasminogen binding.
So in the body, that interference may hamper the destruction of
clots, they suggested.
   The same result was reported in the second Nature paper, by
scientists from Cornell University Medical College and Rockefeller
University in New York. They also found evidence of lipoprotein (a)
accumulations in the atherosclerotic build-up in blood vessels.
   Katherine Hajjar, study co-author from Cornell, said some
scientists suspect that repeated clot formation may predispose a
blood vessel to atherosclerosis. So high levels of lipoprotein (a)
may encourage atherosclerosis by hampering a vessel's ability to
fight clot formation, she said.
   The test-tube results make it logical to suspect that
lipoprotein (a) may hamper clot destruction in humans, said John
Albers of the University of Washington School of Medicine.
   For more evidence, scientists should follow people with
different levels of lipoprotein (a) to see if they show different
rates of clot-induced heart attacks and strokes, he said.

<HEAD>Scientists Locate Gene Underlying Inherited Melanoma</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists have located a gene responsible for
irregularly shaped moles that are a major underlying cause of fatal
skin cancer.
   The gene causes moles known as dysplastic nevi, which often run
in families. The moles can become cancerous, resulting in malignant
melanoma.
   Unlike other forms of skin cancer, melanoma is often fatal. Most
cases are not inherited, but about 10 percent of cases occur in
people with a family history of the disease.
   In the research, scientists came closer to locating the gene
involved in inherited melanoma, although they have not yet isolated
it.
   They said their work ``provides a starting point for the use of
molecular techniques to identify the gene for the disorder and
characterize its function.''
   The research was directed by Dr. Sherri J. Bale of the National
Cancer Institute and was published in today's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   They said that finding the gene and learning the protein it
makes should help scientists understand the causes of inherited
melanoma.
   The research was based on genetic studies of 99 relatives and 26
spouses in six families where melanoma is common. Thirty-four
family members had malignant melanoma, and 31 of these also had
dysplastic nevi. Twenty-four other relatives had dysplastic nevi
alone.

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega met with
an Organization of American States delegation and told them it
would be a dangerous precedent for them to interfere in a country's
internal affairs.
   Noriega also blamed the United States and its history of
intervention in Panama for the country's political crisis.
   ``Today it's Panama, tomorrow it could be any other country,''
the Defense Forces chief told journalists Wednesday after meeting
the OAS delegates.
   The OAS mission was sent in response to the Noriega-controlled
government's voiding of the May 7 presidential vote and the beating
of the top three opposition candidates by pro-Noriega thugs.
International observers say the opposition won the balloting by a
3-1 margin.
   Opposition leaders also met with the OAS delegation on Wednesday
and said they want their election victory recognized and Noriega
retired.
   About 300 marchers accompanied opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara and his running mates Ricardo Arias Calderon and
Guillermo Ford to the OAS delegation's hotel.
   The demonstration, in defiance of a government ban, was broken
up peacefully by about 25 riot police wielding bullhorns. Arias
Calderon said two opposition workers were arrested.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Noriega spokesman, said that when the
issue of retiring Noriega was raised, staff officers expressed
loyalty to Noriega and told the OAS delegates the matter was solely
up to the Defense Forces.
   When asked directly what he planned to do, Noriega thought a
second and said, ``That's the million-dollar question.''
   OAS spokesman Edgardo Costa called the 2{-hour discussion with
Noriega and his staff ``very informative.'' The visiting delegation
comprises the foreign ministers of Trinidad and Tobago, Guatemala
and Ecuador and OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares of Brazil.
   ``We talked about the intimidation, of outrages, of excessive
foreign presence and intimidation by air, sea, land, submarine ...
even the ozone layer has suffered intervention,'' Noriega joked.
   Washington has been working for Noriega's ouster since the
general was indicted on drug-trafficking charges in Florida last
year.
   After the opposition candidates were beaten, President Bush sent
1,900 extra troops to augment security at U.S. Panama Canal
installations.
   The troops have conducted exercises and run armed convoys along
Panamanian roads, as permitted by the 1977 treaties under which the
United States must turn the canal over to Panama in 1999.
   Noriega, who denies the drug charges, claims the United States
is trying to oust him because it does not want to give up the canal
it built and protected for so long.
   ``Noriega has a historical perspective on the issues,'' said
Costa, the OAS spokesman. He said Noriega's talk went back to how
the United States _ wanting a canal _ helped found Panama in 1903
by aiding its secession from Colombia.
   The OAS passed a resolution last week criticizing Noriega and
calling for ``a transfer of power in the shortest possible time.''
   The Panamanian government said some aspects of the resolution,
including the mention of Noriega, violate the OAS charter. It said
it would accept no interference in Panama's internal affairs.
   Noriega holds power in Panama through his command of the Defense
Forces, which have so far remained loyal despite U.S. and
opposition calls for a coup.
   Acting President Manuel Solis Palma told an open meeting of
government bureaucrats on Wednesday that no new elections are
possible before Sept. 1, when his term as ``minister in charge of
the presidency'' ends.
   Solis Palma replaced Eric Arturo Delvalle in the presidency
after Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 following
Noriega's indictment on U.S. drug-trafficking and money laundering
charges.
   Noriega denies the charges.
   The meeting with the OAS was pointedly held in a building in the
Panamanian section of Fort Amador, a former U.S. installation at
the edge of Panama City.
   The fence that surrounds the building abuts a U.S. naval
station, and even Noriega must pass a U.S. military policeman to
enter the area.

<HEAD>US Ahead in Drugs from Biotechnology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. pharmaceutical industry holds a
substantial lead over Japan in use of biotechnology to develop new
drugs for fighting cancer, AIDS and other diseases, according to
the Food and Drug Administration.
   ``Japanese production of new drugs with biotechnology techniques
is robust, but the U.S. holds roughly a 2-1 lead in both numbers of
companies involved and numbers of products,'' said Henry I. Miller,
special assistant to FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young.
   Miller said Wednesday that the U.S. edge was documented in a
recent study by the agency. He also noted that an October 1988
survey by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association found that
54 U.S. companies had 97 products in some phase of clinical
testing, while the FDA study found that the Japanese had 24
companies with a total of 45 products.
   Miller spoke at a ews conference sponsored by the
Washington-based pharmaceutical association. The group's president,
Gerald J. Mossinghoff, said he was encouraged by findings of the
FDA study.
   ``Five years ago there were predictions that Japan would
overtake us in biotechnology by the end of the decade,''
Mossinghoff said. ``That has not happened. There is enormous
vitality in today's biotechnology research and development in the
United States.''
   Mossinghoff said 70 genetically engineered drugs and vaccines
are in human clinical tests in this country, while 10 others on
which clinical testing has been completed are at the FDA for review
before they can be marketed.
   The total of 80 is fewer than the 97 products cited in the
October 1988 survey because the association since then has decided
to focus only on drugs and vaccines that result from genetic
engineering _ excluding other biotechnology products such as
synthetic peptides.
   Genetic engineering involves manipulating the genes that
determine the fundamental physical characteristics of an organism.
   Mossinghoff said that of 182 biotechnology health care patents
issued in the United States last year, 155 had American owners _
far ahead of Japan with 15 patents and Western Europe with nine.
   The latest survey released by the industry association found
that cancer is still the main focus of pharmaceutical biotechnology
research. More than half _ 45 _ of the products involved in
clinical tests or undergoing FDA review are targeted at cancer or
related conditions.
   It also reported that 14 genetically engineered products _
almost twice as many as were listed in the association's first such
survey last July _ are being tested for AIDS or AIDS-related
illnesses.
   Mossinghoff said the association is concerned about efforts by
states to get involved in ``duplicative and unnecessary
regulation'' of biotechnology, despite the existence of ``a
comprehensive regulatory scheme at the federal level.''
   He said that in 1988, 10 state legislative measures were
introduced and three passed _ in Hawaii, Maine and Wisconsin.
   Currently, Mossinghoff said, another biotechnology-related bill
is awaiting the governor's action in Wisconsin while additional
measures are pending before legislators in that state, New Jersey,
New York, Oregon, Texas and Washington.

<HEAD>Feds Reportedly Target House Majority Whip, L.A. Mayor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department reportedly is
conducting preliminary criminal investigations of Mayor Tom Bradley
and Rep. Tony Coelho involving financial dealings with Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Details of the investigations remained secret, but a key
question under scrutiny was whether Bradley and the House majority
whip received illegally preferential treatment with the firm's
``junk bond'' dealers, the Los Angeles Times report today.
   The probe was likely to study whether investment opportunities
may have been offered to the two Democrats in exchange for possible
political favors, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified
sources.
   The report of the preliminary investigation of Bradley follows a
federal subpoena issued last week by the U.S. Attorney's office in
New York's Manhattan district seeking records of his transactions
with the beleaguered brokerage firm.
   Such a preliminary investigation is the first official step in
the Justice Department's formal process for determining whether
evidence warrants a full-scale grand jury investigation leading to
possible criminal prosecution.
   The Justice Department declined to comment on the matter, the
newspaper said.
   Bradley spokesman Bill Chandler said that the mayor was unaware
of any such investigation.
   Coehlo spokesman Fred Hatfield said the California congressman
is positive he is not the target of a Justice Department
investigation.
   Bradley and Coehlo have acknowledged they made investment deals
through Drexel Burnham.
   The brokerage house came under scrutiny after allegations of
insider trading and other securities violations were leveled
against Los Angeles-based Michael Milken, who built its junk bond
division and established the high-risk, high-yield bonds into a
premiere tool to finance corporate takeovers.
   The investigations were begun in Washington by the Justice
Department's Public Integrity Section after an apparent
disagreement between U.S. attorneys' offices in Los Angeles and New
York over whether they were warranted, the Times said.
   In Los Angeles, U.S. Attorney Robert Bonner reportedly concluded
that the available facts did not call for further inquiries.
   But sources told the newspaper Acting U.S. Attorney Benito
Romano of New York concluded that information gathered in his
office's long-running investigation of Drexel Burnham warranted
inquiries into dealings between the investment firm and Bradley and
Coelho.
   Since Romano's office lacked jurisdiction to pursue the probes
because the transactions in question took place in Los Angeles, the
Public Integrity Section assumed responsibility for the
investigations after concluding they were warranted, the Times said.
   The section is a Justice Department unit responsible for looking
into allegations of corruption against judges and other political
figures.
   Bradley, who last month won an unprecedented fifth term as
mayor, faces several investigations into allegations of financial
misdeeds and possible political favoritism.
   Coelho, the third-ranking member of the House leadership, has
acknowledged that he failed to disclose a $50,000 loan from a
savings and loan in California that he used toward purchase of
$100,000 worth of junk bonds.

<HEAD>Tax Burden Higher for Rich and Poor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taxes take almost 36 percent of the income of
the average American but about half the earnings of the nation's
richest and poorest families, the Tax Foundation says.
   For most taxpayers, the federal system is progressive, meaning
it is based in large part on ability to pay, the foundation said.
But state and local taxes are moderately regressive, falling
disproportionately on those with lower incomes.
   In a study released Wednesday, the nonpartisan research
organization found great disparity in the way some taxes are
distributed among the various income levels.
   ``For example, the individual income tax burden of the
$90,000-or-more income group (who pay 27.4 percent of income) is
nine times greater than that of a family in the lowest income
class,'' which pays at an effective rate of 3.1 percent, the
foundation said. The average of all income groups is about 11.4
percent.
   ``Conversely, the gasoline tax burden is almost 10 times greater
for the lowest income group (1.88 percent of income) than for the
highest income families,'' which pay 0.19 percent, the report
stated. The national average is 0.71 percent.
   In 1986, households under $10,000 gave just about half their
incomes _ 49.5 percent _ to federal, state and local governments.
Those with incomes of $90,000 and more paid an average 51.6
percent, the foundation said.
   The tax burden of Americans at all income levels averaged 35.53
percent in 1986 and rose slightly to 36.31 percent a year later.
The figures do not take into account the massive tax overhaul
enacted in 1986, but foundation economists estimated those changes
had little effect on distribution of the individual income tax
burden, except to lessen the load at lowest income levels.
   The foundation, whose trustees include heads of some of the
nation's largest corporations, conducted the study with an eye on
the battle to cut the federal deficit. Even while that fight is
being waged, wrote Robert C. Brown, president of the foundation,
there is a continuing cry for expanding some spending programs and
creating others.
   ``Fundamental to balancing these competing voices is an
awareness of where public money comes from, how the burden falls
upon various income classes, and what types of taxes account for
the various income streams flowing to public coffers,'' Brown
wrote. The study, he said, seeks to provide some of the answers.
   The study reinforced conclusions that liberals have argued for
several years: that the individual income tax is the most
progressive part of the tax system while excise taxes on gasoline,
cigarettes and alcohol are the most regressive.
   In 1986, the average under-$10,000 family used 0.22 percent of
its income to pay the federal tax on telephone service. That tax
claimed only .05 percent of the family making between $30,000 and
$40,000. Payments for social insurance _ chiefly Social Security _
took 10.6 percent of the income from a family making $15,000 to
$20,000 but 6.17 percent of those with incomes over $90,000.
   A family with income between $10,000 and $15,000 paid 3.36 of
its income for state and local sales taxes, compared with 1.42
percent for a $90,000 family.
   The wealthiest families paid an effective rate of almost 38
percent in federal taxes, compared with 19.9 percent for the
$30,000-40,000 family. State and local taxes took almost 13.7
percent from the richest and just under 16 percent from the
$15,000-19,000 family.
   The foundation acknowledged that the study understates total tax
burdens because it is based on a very broad definition of income.
For example, the rental value of the home a family owns is counted
as income, as are employer-paid health insurance and pension
contributions as well as welfare payments.
   The study also assumed that all taxes, including those collected
from corporations, are paid by individuals.

<HEAD>News for the Supermarket Tabloids: Most Say the Line Moves Fast Enough!</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something to contemplate next time you are
stuck in a supermarket checkout line: In a survey, seven out of 10
shoppers say the line in their supermarket moves fast enough.
   Nine out of 10 rate that aspect of their shopping trip as an
important factor when deciding where to get their groceries.
   The Food Marketing Institute, a trade organization representing
the owners of 17,000 U.S. retail food stores which do a total of
$180 billion of business a year, has just issued results of its
18th annual survey of supermarket shoppers.
   While most people rated a speedy checkout as important, they
gave even more weight to seven other factors: the quality of the
fruits and vegetables (important to 98 percent), the variety of
goods, the quality of meat, the friendliness of workers, the
prices, the readability and accuracy of shelf tags and the store's
location.
   The survey, conducted by Opinion Research Corp. through
telephone interviews with 1,031 shoppers, also made these points:
   The shoppers said they spend an average of $74 a week on
groceries, up $3 over last year and up $19 since 1981. They go to
the supermarket an average of 2.3 times a week, same as last year.
   Only about a third of them use coupons or look at ads in the
newspaper for specials. That's down significantly from previous
years.
   One person in five said he buys postage stamps frequently in his
supermarket. Among people whose stores don't sell stamps, one in
four said he would buy them there if they were offered.
   Sixty-nine percent of the women and 63 percent of the men said
their diets could be either a lot or somewhat healthier. Thirty
percent of the men and 22 percent of the women said their diets are
healthy enough.
   Three-quarters of the shoppers under age 24 said they ought to
be eating healthier. But of shoppers over age 65, only half felt
that way.
   As for what they do eat, one in six people claimed to eat more
fruit and vegetables than they used to, one in three to eat less
meat, one in five to eat less fat, oil and sugar.
   Eighteen percent said they eat more fish; 16 percent said they
eat more chicken; 13 percent said they use less salt; 10 percent
said they eat less fried food.
   About six people in 10 said cholesterol and fats are serious
hazards. Four years ago, it was slightly more than four in 10. But
only a fifth of those asked thought sugar is a serious hazard, down
from five years ago, when one person in three thought so.
   Somewhat more than half of those questioned said they are
preparing food differently than they did three to five years ago.
Last year, two-thirds said yes to that question.
   Of those who claim to have changed their cooking methods, 37
percent fry less, 24 percent use less salt, 22 percent use the
microwave more and 20 percent add less fat.
   But last year, even more people claimed to be cutting down on
salt, fat and sugar.
   People in the East said yes more often than those in other parts
of the country when asked if they worry about spoilage or germs,
tampering or improper packaging or canning of food, or pesticides
or residues in their food.
   But Midwesterners are more likely than other people to worry
about unsanitary handling of food by supermarket employees or
fellow shoppers. And Midwesterners, Southerners and Westerners
worry twice as much as Easterners about food preservatives.
   The survey had a sampling error, depending on the percentage of
those responding to individual questions, that ranged from 1.9 to
3.1 percent.

   The dollar was moderately lower against the
Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange rose.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
35.21 points the previous day, added another 153.57 points, or 0.45
percent, to end at 34,005.39 points.
   The dollar finished trading at 142.35 yen, down 0.65 yen from
Wednesday's close of 143 yen. Opening at 142.60 yen, the currency
ranged between 141.45 yen and 142.60 yen.
   ``Japanese investors, including trading houses and securities
firms, sold the dollar for profit taking all at once,'' said an
analyst with the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``After such a sharp rise of the dollar, everybody's selling it
now to collect profits,'' he said.
   The trader said the dollar's downswing followed its trend in New
York Wednesday, where market players sold the currency after
President Bush's comment that the dollar's recent sharp rise was
not favorable. It closed at 142.90 yen on Wall Street.
   On the stock exchange, dealers said the Nikkei rose as the yen
started to recover against the dollar.
   Uncertainties over the foreign exchange market and over a
possible discount rate hike remain in the stock market, making
trading less active, the dealer said.
   Market sources and media reports have been speculating the Bank
of Japan will soon raise official discount rate by at least 0.5
percent from the current 2.5 percent. So far, the monetary
authorities have not made official comments on the rate hike.

<HEAD>Study Finds Bike Helmets Reduce Head Injury Risk 85 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bicycle helmets are so effective at preventing
head injuries that a major campaign should be launched to encourage
riders to wear them, a study published today concludes.
   Although many people have long assumed that helmets are an
important part of bike safety, there has been little scientific
data to back this up. Now, a study has shown that riders with
helmets had an 85 percent reduction in their risk of head injury
and an 88 percent reduction in their risk of brain damage.
   Yet despite their value, the report found, children who are
involved in bicycling accidents rarely wear them.
   ``Safety helmets are effective, but they are not being used
enough,'' the researchers wrote. ``The time has come for a major
campaign to increase their use.''
   They said that stated another way, their results suggest that
people who ride without helmets are seven times more likely to
suffer head injuries and eight times more likely to get brain
injuries than riders who do.
   The report, based on injuries treated at five Seattle area
hospitals over a one-year period, was directed by Dr. Robert S.
Thompson of the Group Health Cooperative in Seattle. It was
published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   They noted that in 1985, bicycle injuries accounted for an
estimated 574,000 emergency room visits and 1,300 deaths in the
United States. The most common cause of death and serious
disability in biking accidents is head injury.
   Among the findings:
   _Sixty-eight percent of the severe brain injuries occurred in
children under age 15.
   _Only 4 percent of those with brain injuries were wearing
helmets.
   _Of the children under age 15 who were involved in biking
accidents, 4 percent wore helmets.
   _Use of helmets increased substantially in those over age 25.
   ``Physicians are not always aware of the importance of helmets,
and they are seldom part of health education efforts,'' the
researchers wrote. ``These factors certainly contribute to their
lack of widespread use.''
   The study was based on 235 people who suffered head injuries
while bicycling. They were compared with 433 people who received
emergency care for other biking-related accidents and 558 members
of a health maintenance organization who said they had been
involved in biking mishaps.
   In an accompanying editorial, Daniel Callahan, head of the
Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., said bicylists should
wear helmets. But he opposed making them mandatory.
   ``In general,'' he wrote, ``we should resist but not totally
oppose the use of the coercive power of the state to force us to
behave in a healthful way.''
   On May 15, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission and
the National Highway Safety Administration announced plans to
improve bicycle safety, including increasing the use of helmets.
   The agencies said they will seek to coordinate local and
national efforts to increase public understanding of bicycle safety
requirements. And the commission is testing available helmets
designed for bicycle riders for effectiveness.

<HEAD>Ethics Panel is Told Congress Can Ban Honoraria, Raise Pay, and Survive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a House ethics task force have been
told that members of Congress can ban honoraria, raise their pay
and still survive politically to serve another term.
   ``Why don't you just do it? You're not going to lose your
seats,'' Lloyd N. Cutler, the chairman of a now-defunct
presidential pay commission, testified Wednesday before the
eight-member panel studying changes in House ethics rules.
   Cutler, White House counsel in the Carter administration, even
suggested how lawmakers could accomplish the politically risky
task: Vote this year for a package to abolish honoraria and
increase pay by an equal amount, make the change effective in
January 1991, and take the case to the voters next year.
   ``It's a risk, but it's a principled stand. If the public
decides that it prefers the finest Congress that other people's
money can buy, I should think you would not wish to be a member of
that kind of a Congress,'' Cutler said.
   Cutler testified only days after House and Senate members
disclosed they earned more than $8.7 million in honoraria last
year, mostly from speeches to special interest groups.
   The chairman of the former Commission on Executive, Legislative
and Judicial Salaries, Cutler referred to special interest payments
of speaking fees as ``dishonoraria'' and ``a totally indefensible
practice.''
   The system ``comes very close to government for sale, at least
legislation for sale,'' Cutler said.
   Cutler's commission recommended, and former President Reagan
proposed, that Congress this year raise its pay 51 percent while
abolishing honoraria.
   After a public outcry that included a campaign against the raise
by radio talk show hosts across the nation, the House voted 380-48
and the Senate 94-6 last February to defeat the pay plan. Cutler
recalled receiving a letter during the debate that said, ``The only
thing worse than a public official is a child molester.''
   Before the plan collapsed, a bipartisan group of House leaders
had worked out broad outlines for a proposal that would have
abolished honoraria in return for more pay and instituted other
ethics reforms.
   After the whole package was dropped, Speaker Jim Wright
appointed the eight-member task force to conduct a long-term ethics
review, and divided the panel's membership equally between the two
parties, with Reps. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., and Lynn Martin, R-Ill.,
as co-chairs.
   Cutler also suggested that Congress end the current restrictions
on amounts of outside earned income that members can receive, and
move instead to establish categories of outside earnings that would
be permitted or prohibited.
   Examples of ``harmless'' outside earnings that should be
allowed, he said, could include income from writing books.
   Currently, rank-and-file House members can retain 30 percent of
their $89,500 salaries, or $26,850 in earned outside income.
Senators can keep 40 percent, or $35,800. There is no restriction
on unearned income such as investment earnings.
   Edward S.G. Dennis, chief of the Justice Department's criminal
division, and former Sen. Charles McC. Mathias Jr., R-Md., told the
task force that the same ethics rules should be applied to all
three branches of government unless there are valid reasons for
exceptions. Ethics provisions currently are far more stringent in
some areas for top executive branch officials than for members of
Congress.
   President Bush has proposed legislation that would revise ethics
laws and would extend many provisions to lawmakers for the first
time.

   Engineers analyzed radio data and
inspected a failed engine valve today to learn why the launch of a
high-tech navigation satellite was aborted at the last second.
   Wednesday night's postponement was the fourth in five days for
the launch of the Delta 2.
   After the engine ignition command was given, a computer sensed a
stuck fuel valve and stopped the Delta 2 rocket's main engine from
firing.
   ``We have a main engine cutoff,'' reported Lt. Col. Ron Rand,
the Air Force launch commentator.
   The 12-story-tall rocket remained locked firmly on the launch
pad. Rand said the launch team used remote controls to stabilize
pressures and make the vehicle safe.
   ``At no time were we in a hazardous condition,'' said the launch
test director, Air Force Lt. Col. Bob Tayloe.
   The Delta 2 was to have boosted into orbit a $65 million Navstar
satellite that will enable U.S. and allied military units such as
ships, planes, submarines and tanks to determine their location
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe.
   Tayloe said no new launch date would be set until experts learn
what went wrong and the problem is fixed. He said the delay would
be at least a few days.
   He said a valve in the main liquid oxygen propellant line failed
to open. The engine ignition command had been given, he said, ``but
with no oxygen, the engine sequence shut down.''
   The valve failure meant the engine did not get enough fuel. The
oxygen mixes with a kerosene-like propellant to power the
spacecraft.
   Small steering rockets at the base of the Delta 2 flashed to
life when the ignition command was given.
   But the main engine start is delayed 2.3 seconds to allow
propellant to flow into the ignition chamber and to give the
computer a chance to determine if anything is wrong.
   If the propellant flows properly, the main engine ignites and
pressures build up, a signal for nine solid fuel booster rockets
surrounding the engine to fire and start the rocket on its way.
   ``Without the proper pressure reading, the signal did not go to
the solids,'' Tayloe said.
   The cutoff, at 7:48 p.m., occurred in the final seconds of a
nine-minute launch opportunity, dictated by the requirement to
launch the satellite into the proper orbit. The first part of the
launch ``window'' was eaten up while a weather plane inspected
clouds suspected of containing potentially dangerous lightning.
   When none was detected, the all-clear was given.

<HEAD>Mass. Officials Say Watkins Wrong About Seabrook, New England Energy
Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

   Massachusetts officials say Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins paints an ``incorrectly bleak picture'' when he
says New England can't generate sufficient energy without the
Seabrook, N.H., atomic plant.
   Watkins' assertion that New England desperately needs Seabrook
to avoid utility-imposed brownouts and blackouts is ``simply
incorrect,'' Massachusetts Energy Resources Secretary Sharon M.
Pollard said Wednesday.
   Watkins on Monday submitted an affidavit urging the U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals to reject a plea by Massachusetts and anti-nuclear
groups to block a low-power testing license for Seabrook. He said
the 1,150-megawatt reactor was the only near-term answer to meet
the region's growing energy demand.
   ``This assertion is false, and paints an incorrectly bleak
picture of the current electric supply situation,'' countered
Pollard in an affidavit and letter submitted to the court Wednesday
in response to the federal energy chief. She said New England's
power needs can be met with improvements in energy conservation,
management and efficiency.
   Pollard also said Watkins was wrong in his assertion that New
England last year suffered ``rolling blackouts,'' or
utility-imposed power outages, due to severe shortages.
   ``New England did not experience any rolling blackouts during
the summer of 1988,'' Pollard wrote. ``According to the director of
power planning for the New England Power Pool, there were only
isolated, localized blackouts due to malfunctions in the
distribution system, not due to New England-wide capacity
deficiencies.''
   Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon criticized
Watkins for inserting himself in the dispute over low-power
licensing between Seabrook opponents and the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, which is an independent federal regulatory agency.
   ``I don't think it's appropriate for the energy secretary to be
wading into these adjudicatory proceedings at this point,'' Shannon
said in a telephone interview from Boston. ``I think it undermines
the credibility of the whole process.''
   Shannon noted that Watkins affidavit did not address any of the
safety and financial concerns raised by Seabrook opponents in their
request for an emergency stay of the license.
   ``They're trying to inject extraneous policy, ideological
arguments, into a legal proceeding. It's not appropriate,'' the
attorney general said. ``There's nothing in the law that says
safety standards shall be met unless the energy secretary says
there's a need for the energy. ... There's nothing that justifies a
terribly unsafe nuclear power plant.''
   ``If he's going to involve himself in the question of nuclear
power plants, then he should familiarize himself with what the law
requires. They think they can rewrite the law through these kinds
of affidavits and regulations,'' Shannon said.
   Shannon and Gov. Michael S. Dukakis say the plant should never
be licensed because of the difficulties of evacuating residents in
the coastal towns near the plant.
   Meanwhile, the NRC voted 4-0 Wednesday to reject opponents'
request to reconsider last week's commission order denying a
regulatory stay. The request was filed Monday on the basis of
critics' assertions that a plant computer system designed to assess
the radiological consequences of an accident was insufficient.
   ``The lateness of intervenors' raising this new theory
constitutes a total failure timely to alert the commission to their
concerns,'' Acting NRC Secretary John C. Hoyle wrote in a
three-page order. ``Moreover, it is clear demonstration that this
matter is not one that even in intervenors' eyes jeopardizes public
health and safety during the limited low-power operations
authorized for Seabrook.''
   The opponents, which include the state, the town of Hampton,
N.H., the Seacoast Anti-Pollution League and the New England
Coalition Against Nuclear Pollution, filed a new stay motion with
the appeals court Wednesday based on that contention.
   Massachusetts Deputy Attorney General Stephen Jonas said the
argument was strengthened Wednesday when the NRC's Atomic Safety
and Licensing Appeal Board sent the issue back to the licensing
board, which had thrown it out Monday.

<HEAD>Bureau To Kill Tortoise-eating Ravens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALIFORNIA CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As many as 1,500 ravens are
targeted for execution to protect Mojave Desert tortoises, which
are too slow to escape the birds' hunting prowess.
   Hundreds of tortoise shells stacked next to some raven nests
help the U.S. Bureau of Land Management to identify 200 to 300
ravens that habitually feast on young tortoises.
   In a pilot program to protect the tortoises, the agency began
killing the birds last week at one site, and two more sites are
being prepared for the four-month kill.
   The agency said up to 1,500 ravens could be killed if it saves
enough tortoises. In recent years, ravens have been killing a
disproportionate number of tortoises.
   In spots, ravens are responsible for 85 percent of young
tortoise deaths, said agency wildlife biologist Ted Rado.
   Once rare in the desert 125 miles northeast of Los Angeles, the
ravens now number between 10,000 and 12,000 _ 15 times their 1968
population.
   Officials have prepared for the raven kill by getting the birds
accustomed to a diet of hard-boiled eggs. At the appointed hour,
the eggs are laced with Starlicide, a poison originally used to
kill European starlings.
   ``We've gone to great pains to absolutely minimize the
poisoning'' of non-target animals, Rado said.
   The eggs are wired to a platform and removed at night. Officials
said Starlicide breaks down into non-toxic compounds so the dead
ravens will pose no threat to wildlife higher in the food chain.
   Other ravens will be shot with rifles, which Rado suspects will
prove a less successful method. He said the birds will likely learn
quickly to steer clear of humans.

   Protesters in Shanghai and the northwestern
cities of Xian and Lanzhou staged funerals last week for students
who died in Beijing during a hunger strike for freedom and
democracy.
   The somber Shanghai procession featured huge wreaths of flowers
to remember comrades in Beijing that an epitath said were
``sacrificed for democracy.''
   The only problem: nobody died.
   Without a free press at a time of great social and political
turmoil, China has been taken over by rumors.
   From student loudspeakers, official government sources,
journalists and the man on the street, the flow of hints and
innuendoes is unceasing.
   Sometimes the rumors are created to sully an enemy or aid a
friend. Sometimes it seems all of Beijing is playing a gigantic
game of ``telephone,'' with no goal other than the passing of
strange information.
   Chinese with a political ax to grind are putting out false or
distorted information to benefit whichever faction they support.
Others, reveling in their life on the inside track, are relaying
the stories with all the glee of small-town gossips.
   The situation is so bad the government outlawed rumor-mongering
in Beijing when it declared martial law on Saturday.
   Widespread student rumors included an imminent attack on
Tiananmen Square, which student protesters have occupied, by
paratroopers and the electrification of subway grates by
authorities.
   But the rumors are not confined to the student movement.
   Within one week, various sources reported that Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang had resigned, returned to power and then was
forced out again.
   Other rumors said Premier Li Peng and three other conservatives
had seized power. Then there was the story that Li and senior
leader Deng Xiaoping had stepped down and that President Yang
Shangkun, a former general, was poised to stage a coup.
   A government source said someone he know in the State Council,
China's Cabinet, told him Li had resigned and that the resignation
would be broadcast on state-run television that night.
   ``I called the TV station and a friend there started laughing.
It just wasn't true but this thing came from the State Council,''
he said.
   Zhang Weiguo, a reporter on the World Economic Herald, a
relatively liberal newspaper based in Shanghai, said the rumor mill
shows how badly China needs a freer press.
   ``People are learning about major government changes and about
the biggest student movement in China's history from popsicle
sellers and newspaper dealers,'' he said. ``This is not a way to
inform the people.''
   Indeed, after several days in early May when the official media
gave lively objective reports about the student movement, the press
has returned to somber reporting, pockmarked with an occasional
shrill editorial calling for stability.

<HEAD>S&amp;L Legislation Clears Another Hurdle, Thanks to Liberal Democrats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush once again is relying on
liberal Democrats to protect his savings and loan bill from attacks
by members of his own party.
   The legislation cleared another hurdle Wednesday on its way to
the House floor for a vote next month. But a GOP amendment that
critics said would have ``crippled'' Bush's proposal to make S&amp;L
owners put up more of their own money narrowly escaped passage by a
17-17 tie, promising future challenges.
   ``We have no illusions that we'll have to fight the capital
issue again, again and again,'' said Assistant Treasury Secretary
David Mullins, the administration's point man for keeping Bush's
package intact. ``It's like one of those cheap movies; the monster
keeps coming back.''
   Bush and other critics have blamed thrift operators' risky and
often fraudulent lending, using federally guaranteed deposits
without exposing much of their own money to possible losses, for
the $90 billion hole in the government S&amp;L insurance fund that
necessitated the bailout.
   ``In the past, this industry has repeatedly won capital fights
in the Congress,'' Mullins said. ``That's one of the reasons we're
here today.''
   The legislation, as approved by the House Banking Committee and
the Senate and endorsed by Bush, would require S&amp;L owners to put
$1.50 of their own money at risk for every $100 of federally
insured deposits they lend.
   Under the House banking panel's version, that hard-cash capital
requirement would rise to $3 for every $100 in outstanding loans by
June 1990.
   The latest assault on the proposal came from an amendment by
Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., during the House Judiciary Committee's
consideration of the bill.
   The measure would make federal regulators go through a lengthy
series of hearings before imposing the proposed new standards on
about 450 S&amp;Ls that enjoy so-called ``supervisory good will''
exemptions from the current capital requirements.
   Federal regulators granted the exemptions in the early 1980s to
then-healthy institutions that agreed to take over and absorb the
losses of unhealthy S&amp;Ls to minimize payouts from the federal
insurance fund.
   Hyde argued that it's unfair to ``change the rules in the middle
of the game.'' He warned that 152 institutions will have to be
considered insolvent unless they are permitted to continue counting
good will as capital.
   ``You're taking institutions that are treading water and headed
toward shore and you're drowning them,'' he said. ``My amendment
says ... you get a chance at due process before we hold the
funeral. I'm trying to make an honest lady out of my government.''
   However, defenders of Bush's proposal argued that capital has no
more value than air in insulating the insurance fund and taxpayers
from poor lending practices.
   ``The capital standards the president proposed and are in this
bill are our insurance policy,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
``This amendment would cripple the bill and make it a
laughingstock.''
   Eleven of the committee's 14 Republicans and six Democrats
supported Hyde's amendment _ one vote shy of the simple majority
needed for approval. Three Republicans and 14 Democrats voted no,
while the committee's chairman, Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas,
abstained.
   ``Strong capital survived,'' Mullins rejoiced afterwards.
   But Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, who as chairman of the
House Banking Committee has been the administration's main
legislative spear carrier on the capital issue, was worried about
the closeness of the call.
   ``The vote ... points to the need for more work to let members
know the seriousness of the problem before the legislation reaches
the floor,'' said Gonzalez.
   In other action, the judiciary committee adopted an amendment
offered by Rep. William J. Hughes, D-N.J., that he said was
designed to avoid a court challenge of civil penalties for bank and
S&amp;L fraud.
   The Bush administration had proposed maximum civil fines for
fraud by individuals and institutions of $1 million a day for any
one violation, up to a total of $5 million.
   Hughes' measure cutting in half the maximum for individuals
passed by a 17-14 vote. But the committee later adopted his
subsequent proposal throwing out the caps for both individuals and
institutions, but limited the penalty to double any loss and
expense to the government.
   The committee defeated by voice vote an attempt by Hughes to
halve the maximum proposed jail term for financial institution
fraud from 20 years to 10 years.

   The struggle to rid China of official corruption
has been a galvanizing force behind the phenomenal outpouring of
support for the pro-democracy student movement.
   Bespectacled office workers and elderly women in baggy trousers
say they are all for democratic reform, but what really angers them
is nepotism and ``guandao,'' the official corruption they must deal
with every day.
   ``Mao sent his son to Korea, Deng sends his children to
America,'' goes one popular slogan, which by the contrast accuses
today's Communist Party leaders of furthering their own interests
instead of serving the public.
   One of Mao Tse-tung's sons died in the Korean War, while several
of senior leader Deng Xiaoping's children have had extended stays
in the United States.
   Ordinary Chinese view with helplessness and rage the power of
high officials to send their sons and daughters abroad, obtain good
housing and cars and buy amenities.
   Common people often cannot buy a train ticket or a good
television unless they know the right people. The ``back door'' is
the most common entrance for getting many goods and services, and
everything comes with a price, ranging from ``gifts'' of cigarettes
and free meals to cash bribes.
   Officials' access to sought-after goods has made them
susceptible to bribery. Many consider receiving money, lavish
banquets, color television sets or stereos all part of the job.
   Newspapers regularly report how officials stockpile scarce goods
such as fertilizer and steel, buying them up at artificially low
state-set prices and selling them for huge profits on the free
market.
   Despite a government crackdown last year, many officials still
use their positions to set up companies that distribute _ for a
healthy profit _ hard-to-get raw materials and resources.
   One of the first posters to go up at Beijing University during
the student upheaval listed several dozen senior officials who it
alleged got their jobs because of family connections.
   Premier Li Peng, it noted, was the adopted son of the late Chou
En-lai. People's Liberation Army Chief of Staff Chi Haotian is
President Yang Shangkun's son-in-law.
   A recent survey of 10,000 workers found that 46 percent listed
corruption as China's most serious social problem and 63 percent
said improper deeds by party members was a major political problem.
   Chinese courts handled 37,000 cases of official profiteering
last year, up 50 percent from 1987, and 101 embezzlers and
bribe-takers were sentenced to death or life imprisonment.
   Local governments have set up neighborhood centers where
ordinary people can report official abuses of power without fear of
recrimination.
   But most agree that corruption is here to stay until China
alleviates imbalances in supply and demand and closes the wide gap
between subsidized state-set and free market prices.

<HEAD>American Hearth Association Now Says Four Eggs A Week Is Okay</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Healthy Americans can now add a fourth egg to
their weekly menu and still stay within American Heart Association
recommendations for a low-cholesterol diet.
   Heart association officials say the diet recommendations haven't
changed, but that what is known about eggs has. New tests show that
eggs are not as rich in cholesterol as previously believed.
   Dr. John LaRosa, a George Washington University clinician and
chairman of the American Heart Association's nutrition committee,
said Wednesday that the AHA's dietary guidelines were revised after
new tests by the U.S. Department of Agriculture showed that egg
yolks average 213 milligrams of cholesterol instead of 274 as
previous tests showed.
   The AHA recommends that dietary cholesterol should be limited to
300 milligrams a day. Previously, the heart group had said healthy
Americans should limit egg consumption to just three a week.
   Under the new measurements, LaRosa said four eggs a week could
now be consumed by healthy Americans and still meet the AHA's
guidelines.
   New measurements on the egg's cholesterol levels were announced
last week, and LaRosa said Wednesday at a meeting on dietary fats
that the AHA was revising its egg recommendations.
   The AHA decision comes as good news to an egg industry that has
suffered from a growing American awareness of the effects of
dietary cholesterol.
   Industry figures show that egg sales in the U.S. dropped by a
billion dollars, from $4.1 billion to $3.1 billion, between 1984
and 1988. Industry officials have blamed the decline on changes in
dietary patterns.
   Officials at the AHA conference emphasized that the new heart
association guidelines of four eggs a week apply to people with
healthy cardiovascular systems. The guidelines still call for
patients with elevated cholesterol levels or heart disease to avoid
eggs and other foods rich in cholesterol or saturated fats.
   The announcement noted that ``the four eggs include invisible
yolks consumed in baked and other prepared foods.''
   LaRosa, in a news conference at the conclusion of a two-day AHA
conference on dietary fats, said the rest of the dietary guidelines
recommended by the heart association for three decades remain in
effect and are finding more support by other scientific
organizations.
   ``They have been adapted by almost ever body that has looked at
nutrition in the last few years. The guidelines have stood the test
of scientific scrutiny,'' he said.
   Recent studies by the National Academy of Science and the U.S.
Surgeon General's Office have been consistent with the heart
association guidelines.
   The AHA conference on dietary fats came to no firm consensus on
the value of omega-3 fat from fish oil, a substance that some
studies have suggested is able to reduce cholesterol levels in the
blood substantially.
   ``We have lots of data, but not enough yet to know what the
picture looks like on fish oil,'' said LaRosa.
   He said there are not yet enough studies to prove conclusively
the benefits of a diet rich in omega-3 fats, which are commonly
found in the oils of cold water fishes.
   Dr. Scott Grundy, director of the University of Texas Center for
Human Nutrition in Dallas, said ``we are not at the stage where we
can generalize'' the benefits of fish oil for the public.
   ``I think it holds great promise, but we don't yet know the
direction the research will take,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, D. M. Hegsted of the Harvard Medical School said a
sensible diet ``better include a serving of fish once a week.''
   Other elements in the AHA dietary guidelines include:
   _Limiting fat consumption to less than 30 percent of the daily
calories.
   _Limiting saturated fats to 10 percent of the calories. These
fats come from red meats, butter, whole dairy products, coconut and
other palm oils.
   _Limiting cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams or less daily.
   _Having carbohydrates, such as breads, pasta, beans, fruits and
vegetables, account for half or more of dietary calories.
   _Limiting sodium intake to three grams a day or less.
   _Limiting alcohol consumption to one to two ounces daily.

   A state official whose nomination for a top
federal post has run into trouble with anti-abortion forces spent a
rocky 4{ years as head of the Oklahoma's largest agency before
switching jobs.
   Robert Fulton took over as director of the state's Department of
Human Services amid controversy and left as criticism of his
administration grew in the Legislature.
   His critics questioned his administrative capabilities and
accused him of replacing a legislative patronage system with a one
of his own.
   Fulton's supporters say he is a hard worker gifted in putting
together programs and obtaining federal dollars. But one backer
said he is an eternal optimist prone to promise more than he can
deliver.
   For the past two years, he has been social services secretary, a
member of Gov. Henry Bellmon's cabinet serving as liaison with
Human Services.
   Fulton, 57, had a long federal career before coming to Oklahoma,
working for five agencies over 21 years, including the U.S. Senate
Budget Committee.
   Now, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan
wants him to return to Washington to head the Family Services
Administration, which manages major welfare programs.
   But his nomination has come under attack by some conservative
Republican senators because of a old policy at an Oklahoma state
hospital regarding the treatment of infants with crippling spina
bifada.
   Fulton was named as a defendant in a 1985 lawsuit alleging that
from 1977 to 1983 several babies born with the severe spinal defect
were denied live-saving surgery at the state hospital.
   Fulton said the deaths occurred before he became Human Services
director in 1983 and he took steps to improve treatment for spina
bifida babies. He was recently dropped as a defendant.
   In a recent interview, he said anti-abortion forces ``have their
axes out for Louis Sullivan and I've become their symbol.'' He said
he couldn't change their minds if ``I laid down in front of 15
abortion clinics across the country.''
   Sullivan's own nomination ran afoul of anti-abortion advocates
when he indicated in an interview earlier this year that he
personally opposed abortion but favored women's right to choose.
   Fulton had a difficult task ahead of him when he came to
Oklahoma to succeed the late L.E. Rader, who ruled the Department
of Human Services with an iron fist from its infancy and was
considered one of the state's most powerful figures.
   ``He was an institution,'' said Fulton. ``I didn't go in and
purge Rader people because that is not my style. I thought my job
was to be something of a healer and I tried to do that.
   ``But I was obviously not a Loyd Rader. I could not play those
games with the Legislature like he could and I ran into some flak.''
   His 4{ years as Human Services director covered a time of severe
budget restraints caused by a collapse in the oil industry in 1983.
   State Sen. Bernest Cain, chairman of the Senate Human Services
Committee, said Fulton is ``is brilliant in understanding the
interaction of state and federal programs and dollars.''
   ``He also was an extreme optimist,'' Cain said.
   He said Fulton's optimism may have led him to tell legislators
that he could get by on less funding than the agency really needed
``and that caused some problems.''
   A few months after Fulton took over the post, a huge revenue
shortfall hit state government, forcing cutbacks at Human Services.
   In the next two years, the work force was slashed from about
14,500 to about 12,500.

<HEAD>Bush Issues Reserved Statement on Israel Plans for Palestinian Elections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's cautious response to Israel's
plan for Palestinian elections in the occupied territories fell
short of the State Department's wholehearted approval.
   The election proposal ``constitutes an important contribution to
a process that has the potential to bring about negotiations''
leading to limited Palestinian self-rule, Bush told Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Rabin in a meeting Wednesday.
   The proposal ``gives us something to work with, and we are now
looking for a constructive Arab response to it,'' said the White
House statement released following the meeting.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler, who spoke
shortly before Bush and Rabin met, was more enthusiastic. Referring
to the plan put forward by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir,
she said, ``We are wholeheartedly supportive of his election
proposals. We want to work with the Israelis and the Palestinians
to move the peace process forward.''
   Tutwiler's comments marked the first time the Bush
administration has expressed unreserved backing for the election
proposal set forth seven weeks ago. The State Department reserved
judgment on other aspects of the Israeli plan.
   A State Department official said he had not seen the White House
statement and could not comment on the difference in tone between
the two statements.
   Bush also ``voiced his deep concern over the escalating violence
in the occupied territories and expressed the strong hope that all
parties would exercise maximum restraint,'' according to the
statement.
   Rabin appealed to Bush to help Israel enlist support among Arabs
and Palestinians for the Israeli election plan.
   ``My impression is the United States would like to assist Israel
in finding the partner among the Palestinians in the territories to
move ahead along the outlines of the peace process,'' Rabin told
reporters outside the White House. He did not say what steps Bush
urged Israel to take.

<HEAD>A Look at Key Democrats Involved in Negotations Over Wright's Future</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a brief look at key congressional
Democrats who are involved in negotiations over House Speaker James
Wright's political future, or who will be affected by them.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Speaker</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   First elected to Congress in 1954, Wright is a New Deal Democrat
who represents the district around Fort Worth, Texas. Wright was
elected House majority leader in 1976, which put him in line for
the speakership after Thomas P. O'Neill stepped down in 1986.
Potential opponents for the speaker's post stepped aside,
recognizing Wright already had the votes among his Democratic House
colleagues.
   But Wright drew criticism from those colleagues once in the job.
Some accused him of a tyrannical leadership style. Others said his
old-fashioned, pompous rhetorical style wasn't in step with the
times, didn't represent the Democrats well on television, and
provided the opposition with an easy target.
   Wright took the lead in forging a Central American peace plan.
But he drew fire from House members on the touchy issue of a
congressional pay raise, giving in to public pressure and forcing
members to go on record with a vote _ a move that killed the big
pay raise proposal.

<HEAD>The Majority Leader</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Thomas Foley of Washington state has served in Congress
since his election in 1964, and emerged as a leader in 1974 when he
leaped through the seniority system to the chairmanship of the
agriculture committee. In 1980 he was appointed to the post of
majority whip by O'Neill and Wright, and when Wright moved up in
1986 Foley drew no opposition to become majority leader.
   Foley is a former practicing lawyer and prosecutor from Spokane
who has built a liberal voting record in Congress. He is widely
respected by his colleagues for his calm judgment, although he is
hardly exciting or dynamic as a speaker.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Majority Whip</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Tony L. Coelho of California has served in Congress since
he was first elected in 1978, after working as an aide to his
predecessor for 15 years. He represents California's Central Valley
farmland.
   Already wise in the ins-and-outs of Congress when he was
elected, Coelho quickly moved up the leadership ladder. He
succeeded in generating political IOUs from many Democratic members
as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee _
where his job was raising millions of dollars and handing it out to
Democratic campaigns.
   He was rewarded in 1986 with the majority whip's post. He has
been admired for his fund-raising success, his political savvy and
his ability to overcome epilepsy. But Coelho's reputation, and
perhaps his future on the leadership ladder, may have been hurt by
recent reports of questionable financial dealings.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Richard Gephardt</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Although he no longer holds a leadership position, Rep. Richard
Gephardt of Missouri is one of the leaders House Democrats look to.
He ran an unsuccessful but credible campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1988 and is widely expected to try again.
   He formerly held the job of chairman of the Democratic Caucus,
and is considered a possible candidate for House speaker if Wright
gives up the post, or, if Foley moves up, a potential candidate for
the majority leader's post.
   Gephardt has a moderate voting record and has made tough trade
legislation his big issue. His presidential campaign attracted wide
support from his House colleagues, evidence of his political
spadework as well as the respect of his peers. But it also caused
him some discomfort, as his record as a congressional insider did
not mesh well with the populist image he built his campaign on.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>William Gray</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Rep. William H. Gray III of Pennsylvania is chairman of the
House Democratic Caucus and chairman of the Budget Committee, where
he has been a visible leader of Democrats on the budget, deficit
and tax issues.
   Gray was elected to Congress in 1978 and quickly moved into the
ranks of the party's leaders. He continues to preach at the Baptist
church in Philadelphia whose pulpit propelled him into politics.
Gray has advanced quickly in Congress by being able to forge
effective compromises.

<HEAD>Microbe in Public Water Blamed for Large Diarrhea Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty percent of residents of a Georgia county
got sick two years ago from drinking the public water supply,
demonstrating that germs can get through the standard purification
process, a study concludes.
   Investigators from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta tracked the cause of the outbreak of intestinal illness in
Carrollton County in the first two months of 1987. The culprit was
a microscopic parasite called cryptosporidium.
   They estimated that 13,000 of the 64,900 residents of the county
got sick from drinking the public water supply.
   The researchers found that the microbe got through the county's
filtering and purification system even though it met standards set
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
   A report on the investigation, directed by Dr. Edward B. Hayes,
was published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The county gets its water from a small river that runs through
pastureland. The researchers speculated that low-level
cryptosporidium infection in cattle and an overflowing sewer pipe
may have allowed the microbe to get into the river.
   The parasite is highly resistant to chlorine, which kills other
germs.
   The CDC investigators said their results ``demonstrate that
cryptosporidium can contaminate filtered public water systems _
even when the water quality is within regulatory limits for
coliform bacteria, chlorine, and turbidity.''
   In an editorial, Dr. Betty Olson of the University of
California, Irvine, said the report ``is a dramatic and important
reminder of the country's need to keep a vigilant eye on its water
supplies.''

<HEAD>Safety Board Urges FAA to Improve Air Safety Over LA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board says
the Federal Aviation Administration should act immediately to
improve air traffic procedures in the crowded skies over southern
California.
   The NTSB, which conducted a special probe into the incident,
said Wednesday that controller errors contributed to a Feb. 13
incident in which two planes flew too near each other.
   The investigation into air traffic in that region cited a
variety of problems, including excessive overtime, poor training
and understaffing of controllers.
   The NTSB ``believes that these safety problems warrant immediate
attention and corrective actions by the FAA to prevent a diminished
level of safety in the high traffic density of the southern
California basin area,'' the board said in a 22-page letter to the
FAA.
   The February close call occurred when a British Airways jumbo
jet and an American Airlines plane were misdirected and passed
closer to each other than federal rules permit.
   The study noted that nine errors have been committed in the
chief control facility in the past 14 months.
   Southern California was the site of the nation's last major
midair crash, which killed 82 people in August 1986 over the Los
Angeles suburb of Cerritos.
   The NTSB noted that the FAA has been aware of personnel and
equipment problems at the Los Angeles Coast Terminal Radar Approach
Control Facility for at least three years.
   ``The safety board believes that numerous deficiencies and
problems have contributed directly or indirectly to the increase in
operational errors and that this increase should serve as a warning
or precursor to a potential accident,'' the NTSB said.

<HEAD>House Going After Fax Attackers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House members are going after ``fax attacks''
by advertisers and telephone merchandisers who use computers to
dial phone numbers at random could endanger the public health and
safety.
   The lawmakers said Wednesday the intrusive sales pitches on
facsimile machines use up the receivers' paper and that, for mobile
and pager-phone users, often make the recipient pay for the calls.
   On top of that, citizens have a right to privacy, said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass., the author of one of three bills that would
restrain the use of ``junk fax'' advertising and computer
auto-dialers.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., said
unsolicited telemarketing ``increasingly crosses the line between
helpful and unacceptably obtrusive.''
   ``Each day they are used by more than 180,000 solicitors to call
more than 7 million Americans. Unfortunately, these machines are
often programmed to dial sequentially whole blocks of numbers,
including hospitals, fire stations, pagers and unlisted numbers.''

<NOTE>Bill Would Require Disclosures on Athletic Graduates</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill requiring colleges to disclose how many
of their athletes graduate could improve education standards for
student athletes, a congressman and former pro basketball player
says.
   Rep. Tom McMillen, D-Md., a sponsor of the ``Student-Athlete
Right to Know Act,'' called the effort ``a relatively innocuous
consumer information bill, designed to provide the students and
parents with valuable information about the school they are
considering.''
   McMillen played for the University of Maryland before playing
professionally with the Atlanta Hawks and Washington Bullets.
   In testimony submitted Wednesday to a House subcommittee, he
said the disclosure bill itself will not ensure that athletes get
the education they deserve but could help ``to move us back towards
the primary goal of educating young people and to developing basic
standards for student-athletes.''
   The right-to-know measure, sponsored by former New York Knicks
star Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., in the Senate, would require
schools receiving federal assistance to report on the graduation
rates of their athletic-scholarship recipients and compare their
rate with that of the general student population.

<NOTE>GAO Says America's Elderly May Need Protection</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (ap) _ Federal rules may be necessary to protect
America's elderly from ripoffs because private nursing home
insurance is so poorly regulated by states, the General Accounting
Office says.
   In a report prepared at the direction of 88-year-old Rep. Claude
Pepper, the GAO said many states allow insurers to sell policies
with less protection than recommended by model plans developed by
the national organization of state insurance commissioners.
   ``While such provisions can result in lower policy premiums,
they can adversely affect policy holders by decreasing the
likelihood that needed services will be covered and increasing the
risk of policy terminations for reasons other than non-payment of
premiums,'' the report said.
   Pepper, chairman of the health and long-term hospital care
subcommittee of the House Select Committee on Aging, is
hospitalized in serious condition at Walter Reed Army Medical
Center.

<HEAD>California Bans Assault Rifles; Lousisiana Kills Similar Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   California has become the first state to ban the sale of
semiautomatic assault weapons, but a similar bill in the Louisiana
Legislature was killed in committee.
   California's legislation, signed into law Wednesday by Gov.
George Deukmejian, bans the sale of 55 semiautomatic assault
rifles, pistols and shotguns beginning Jan. 1. But they allow
people who currently own those weapons lawfully to keep them if
they register with the state.
   ``There's no question it's a defeat for gun owners and for us,''
Richard Gardiner of the National Rifle Association's Washington,
D.C. office, said of the signing. ``But I think the backlash will
be greater than the spread (of similar bills). While it's a
tactical loss, strategically it's going to be a big help.''
   The legislation was prompted by a Jan. 17 attack at a Stockton
elementary school in which a deranged man with an AK-47 assault
rifle killed five children and wounded 30 other people before
taking his own life.
   Deukmejian said he wasn't surprised or worried about gun owners'
ensuing threats to recall him for signing the measures, adding that
he also would sign pending legislation requiring a 15-day waiting
period for all gun sales. There is already a waiting period for
pistols.
   In Louisiana, gun control proponents said a similar bill's
failure to gain approval Wednesday was the result of rural
legislators who did not appreciate the problems of violent crime in
New Orleans and other metropolitan areas.
   The Louisiana House's Committee on Criminal Justice deferred
action on the bill, which would have required registration of
semiautomatic assault rifles.
   Lawmakers said it was unlikely the ``Sportsman's Paradise''
would adopt any gun legislation this year.
   Sarah Brady, whose husband, James, was wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt on then-President Reagan, praised
Deukmejian's action.
   ``We're very pleased with the bill,'' Mrs. Brady, head of
Handgun Control Inc., said during an appearance in Philadelphia.
``It's significant because people statewide came together and
realized this issue is becoming less and less political and more
necessary.''
   She said believes President Bush eventually will sign a
permanent federal ban on the domestic manufacturing and sale of
assault weapons.
   Bush recently banned importation of such weapons.
   Gardiner scoffed at claims that the California legislation would
spread across the states, noting that gun-control advocates made
similar statements in 1981, after the town of Morton Grove, Ill.,
passed a handgun ban in the wake of the shootings of singer John
Lennon, Reagan and Pope John Paul VI.
   ``They've said it every time they passed a bill, and it's never
happened,'' Gardiner said. ``After Morton Grove, three little
neighboring cities passed bans. But what was important was that a
whole passel of states passed legislation prohibiting cities from
taking such action.''

<TEXT>
   Some of House Speaker Jim Wright's
hometown supporters say the 34-year veteran's political troubles
are Republicans' way of getting even for John Tower's rejection as
defense secretary.
   ``Jim is a dedicated person. He is honest,'' said Maybelle
Gregory, a longtime Democratic activist. ``It's pure and simple
politics.''
   ``It's get-even-for-Tower time,'' added Bob Collins, a patron at
the White Elephant Saloon in the Fort Worth Stockyards.
   The House ethics committee is investigating 69 charges that the
Democratic congressman violated the congressional ethics code.
   His attorneys reportedly proposed an arrangement Wednesday under
which Wright would step down from the speakership if the most
serious ethics charges were dropped.
   But Wright, 66, denied that he's considering resigning and vowed
to ``press ahead.''
   ``All of these people who are out there accusing him of things
have done the same ... things he did,'' said Diane Emling of nearby
Euless. ``I just wish people would leave him alone.''
   Ms. Emling and several other regulars at Angelos barbecue
restaurant in Fort Worth were pondering Wright's political fate as
they drank beer Wednesday night.
   ``They jump on a whipping dog and they get with it,'' said
mechanic Jack Russell, referring to Wright's political enemies.
   Estil Vance, former chairman of the Tarrant County Democratic
Party and former Fort Worth city councilman, lauded Wright's
congressional career, citing Wright's push for military contracts
that benefit Fort Worth manufacturers and his efforts to keep
Carswell Air Force Base in the city. Vance also said Wright was a
key player in the decision to locate the super collider in Texas.
   Like others, Vance blamed much of Wright's predicament on
partisan politics, which he said was enhanced by the Tower
rejection.
   ``I think it almost feeds on itself,'' Vance said. ``It, to a
certain extent, is partisan, just as the John Tower thing is
partisan.''
   Texas Attorney General Jim Mattox said it would be ``a tragedy''
for Texas if Wright stepped down as speaker.
   And Republican Gov. Bill Clements said: ``I think that it would
be a great loss to the state of Texas. He is a most, most powerful
person in Washington and it has to be good for Texas. There's no
question about that.''

<HEAD>Stocks Rise, Dollar Falls In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index rose
moderately today, while the dollar declined against the Japanese
yen after gaining 8.56 yen since May 11.
   The dollar closed at 142.35 yen, down 0.65 yen from Wednesday's
143.00-yen close. The currency opened at 142.60 yen and fluctuated
in a wide range of 141.45 yen to 142.60 yen.
   ``The basic tone of today's trading was speculative investors'
dollar-selling,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   He said a rumor that the Bank of Japan might raise its official
discount rate by 0.75 percentage points also encouraged yen-buying.
   Japanese market sources and news media have speculated that the
central bank would raise the key rate by at least 0.5 percentage
points from the present 2.5 percent, but monetary authorities have
made no official announcement. Higher interest rates in Japan would
tend to make the yen more attractive to investors.
   ``But the release of the wholesale price index, which showed
only a modest increase in May, made investors think Japanese
economic growth was slowing down and buy back the dollar,''
Kinugasa added.
   The Bank of Japan reported that the nation's wholesale price
index rose by 0.2 percent in the first 10 days of May from the
previous 10-day period and 3.1 percent from a year earlier.
   ``Basically, the market has a strong demand for the dollar even
though some speculative players occasionally sell it like they did
today,'' Kinugasa said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed
at 34,005.39, up 153.57 points, or 0.45 percent. The index had
climbed 35.21 points the previous day.
   Dealers said the yen's recovery reassured stock investors and
prompted buying.
   Kenji Ishizuka, a dealer with Daiwa Securities, said the
wholesale price index report also encouraged buy orders.
   ``It's mainly because the figure was within their
expectations,'' he said.
   Ishizuka said the Nikkei's rise also was helped by substantial
profit increases shown in corporate financial reports for fiscal
1988 that came out today.

<HEAD>Nakasone Acknowledges Recruit Donations; Says He's Innocent In Scandal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone today
acknowledged receiving political donations from the company at the
center of an influence-peddling scandal but testified that he was
innocent of any wrongdoing.
   In long-awaited testimony before Parliament, Nakasone said he
received $235,000 in political donations from the Recruit Co. from
1982 to 1987.
   It was his first public acknowlegement that he accepted
political donations from the information and publishing
conglomerate, but he said the contributions were reported according
to law.
   ``I am totally innocent,'' Nakasone told the Budget Committee of
the House of Representatives. ``I refused to testify earlier
because I have never done anything wrong.''
   Opposition leaders contend Nakasone, prime minister from 1983 to
1987, played a central role in the scandal that has seriously
shaken public confidence in government. They demand his resignation
from parliament.
   Nakasone refused to step down, saying ``I will continue my job
to make a contribution to my country.''
   While the former prime minister's voice was heard in a national
televivion broadcast, cameras flashed only still pictures of a
grim-faced Nakasone during more than two hours of testimony. By
law, TV cameras are banned at parliament sessions during testimony
of special witnesses.
   Nakasone had acknowledged that three of his aides bought a total
of 29,000 Recruit shares and that profits from their sale after the
issue went public were used for political activites.
   He testified that sale of the shares had reaping the aides about
$450,000.
   Recruit had sold unlisted shares in a subsidiary to scores of
people prominent in government and business, including at least 17
politicians or their aides. The buyers made large profits when the
shares went on public sale.
   Eleven of the 17 were members of Nakasone's Cabinet.
   During questioning by Seiichi Inaba, a member of the opposition
Japan Socialist Party, Nakasone denied personal involvement in the
stock purchases. ``These were economic acts by the individuals who
purchased them,'' he said.
   For months, the opposition has demanded testimony in Parliament
from Nakasone, who was prime minister at the time of dubious stock
deals and large political contributions by Recruit.
   The governing Liberal Democrats refused until last week, calling
the demands ``improper'' because of Nakasone's status as a former
prime minister.
   A long opposition boycott of debate on the budget changed that.
   Liberal Democrats forced the budget through the House of
Representatives last month, but widespread criticism resulted and a
deal was made: The opposition would not boycott the budget in the
upper house if Nakasone testified before the budget committee.
   Prosecutors have so far arrested 14 bureaucrats and businessmen
in the scandal on charges involving bribery and violations of
securities laws. They have also filed charges against two members
of Parliament.
   On Monday, prosecutors charged lawmaker Takao Fujinami, a
Nakasone lieutenant and former chief Cabinet secretary, with
bribery in the scandal.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Socialist Party, the
largest opposition group, has accused Nakasone of doing Recruit a
special favor that involved ordering Nippon Telegraph and Telephone
Co. and the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications to buy
multimillion-dollar U.S. supercomputers.
   Two of the supercomputers made by Cray Research Inc. were resold
to Recruit and helped establish it in leasing computer time and
related telecommunications services.
   Hisashi Shinto, former chairman of Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone, which was a government monopoly until 1985, was arrested
and accused of taking bribes from Recruit in the form of the
bargain stock shares.
   The opposition also wants to know whether Nakasone recommended
Hiromasa Ezoe, the former chairman of Recruit, for membership on
several government advisory committees.
   In a survey published today, support for the governing party
slipped to an all-time low.
   According to a survey of 2,280 eligible voters conducted last
weekend by the mass-circulation Yomiuri Shimbum, support for the
Liberal Democrats stands at just 26.5 percent, the lowest since its
founding in 1955, while combined support for five opposition
parties stands at 26.7 percent. The survey said 44.1 percent of
those polled supported no party.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Boosts Handicapped Schooling</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public schools must provide education for all
handicapped children, no matter how severe the disability or how
little they might benefit, a federal appeals panel has ruled in
reversing a lower court.
   The ruling Wednesday by the three-judge panel of the 1st U.S.
Circuit of Appeals was in a New Hampshire case, but it could affect
public schools and handicapped children throughout the country.
   Judge Hugh Bownes wrote the decision that reversed a ruling last
year in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire.
   The appeals court said the 1975 Education for All Handicapped
Children Act ``mandates an appropriate public education for all
handicapped children, regardless of the level of achievement that
such children might attain.''
   The judges also said, ``A school district has a duty to provide
an educational program for every handicapped child in the district,
regardless of the severity of the handicap.''
   The case began in 1974 with a complaint filed in the federal
court in New Hampshire on behalf of a boy identified as Timothy W.
   The complaint alleged his rights under federal and New Hampshire
law were violated by the Rochester, N.H., school district when it
said the boy was not eligible for special education.
   At later hearings, the boy's mother and therapists testified
that Timothy could hear, see bright light and respond to music,
touching and talking.
   But a developmental pediatrician testified Timothy ``did not
have educational needs and could not benefit from an education.''
   The district court ruled last July that federal law mandates
that before a child receives a special education, a determination
must be made whether the child will benefit from it.
   The court concluded that Timothy could not be educated.
   The appeals court remanded its ruling to the district court
until the school district develops a ``suitable individualized
program'' for Timothy.
   Rochester School Superintendent Raymond Yeagley said the appeals
court decision will force the school district to shift resources
from students who could benefit from education and focus them on
less capable students.
   ``School districts are getting to the point they are asked to do
everything and spend more on education services than education,''
said Gwendolyn Gregory, deputy general counsel of the National
School Boards Association in Washington.
   The association had filed a brief in support of the Rochester
school district.
   Ms. Gregory said the appeals court decision could make a school
liable for such medical services as physical therapy that could be
considered education.
   But Lorraine Greiff, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Office of
Handicapped Affairs, hailed the decision.
   ``I think it's terrific. How can you prove who is going to
thrive and who isn't?'' she said.
   Ronald K. Lospennato, the New Hampshire lawyer who represented
Timothy and the Disability Rights Center, said, ``It simply
reinforces what the Education Act said all along: that all
handicapped children are entitled to an education.
   ``They shouldn't have to fight to get in the schoolhouse door.''

<TEXT>
   The Congress Of People's Deputies is new, but the
method of counting votes is as old as Communist rule.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, presiding over the initial
debate and several procedural votes at today's inaugural session of
the 2,250-member body, promised to speed up the process _ but not
in time for this session.
   Since the Communists came to power in 1917, balloting has been
by show of hands. At party meetings, delegates traditionally raise
their party cards. Members of the legislature, the Supreme Soviet,
vote with ``a forest of hands.''
   By custom, such votes simply endorse the decisions of the
leadership, making precise counts unnecessary.
   The tradition started to falter only within the last year.
   But as wrangling broke out today at the start of the
long-awaited session of the country's first competitively elected
congress, it became apparent the old way would be quite
time-consuming.
   Opposition to the leadership emerged, even on procedural
questions.
   ``Who is for this agenda?'' Gorbachev asked as the body
considered the plan adopted by a closed caucus Wednesday night.
Most of the 2,155 deputies present raised their delegate cards.
   ``Who is against?'' he asked. When only a smattering of cards
appeared in the cavernous auditorium, Gorbachev began counting
aloud. He gave up when he reached 31 and asked for an official
count.
   A 10-minute pause ensued as representatives of each sector in
the hall counted votes by hand. The tally was 379 against with nine
abstentions.
   Gorbachev declared the agenda adopted, but there was grumbling
among the deputies and he called for another show of hands of those
opposed.
   ``Do not get excited,'' he said. ``I know what to do. I can see
that this is the minority. I think we are not going to count this
time. There is an absolute majority. The agenda is adopted.''
   After several more vote counts, the president told the delegates
that an electronic counting system would be installed.
   ``Soon,'' he said. ``Very soon.''

<HEAD>Five Students Arrested in Sexual Assault on Mentally Retarded Girl</HEAD>

   More arrests are possible in the sexual
attack of a mentally retarded teen-ager who was assaulted with a
baseball bat and broomstick by five boys as eight others watched,
authorities said.
   Five high school students from the affluent suburb of Glen
Ridge, including the co-captains of the football team, were
arrested Wednesday. The eight who apparently watched the attack
also were Glen Ridge High School students between 16 and 18 years
old, authorities said.
   ``We are satisfied that this was a non-consensual sexual assault
by these five males against this young woman,'' Essex County
prosecutor Herbert Tate said at a news conference. ``She didn't
understand the nature and quality of her actions.''
   Police said the other eight students are being investigated
although none has been charged. The group includes the son of the
Glen Ridge police lieutenant who initially handled the
investigation, according to WNBC-TV and the New York Daily News.
   When the detective discovered that his son was one of the eight
teens who allegedly was present and did not intervene, he took his
son in for questioning and notified his superiors, according to the
published reports. He then reportedly was removed from the case and
it was turned over to Essex County authorities.
   The hourlong assault took place March 1 after the students and
the girl met in a Glen Ridge park and went to the nearby home of
the football players charged in the case, 18-year-old twins Kevin
and Kyle Scherzer, authorities said. The Scherzers' parents were
not at home, authorities said.
   The girl, who has since turned 18, was assaulted in a basement
room with a small baseball bat and a broomstick, Tate said. There
was no sexual intercourse, police said.
   Rumors of a gang rape had circulated throughout the small town
for weeks, and some parents said they were angry at the long delay
in making the arrests.
   ``Why weren't parents told?'' asked Marcia Mann, whose daughter
is a sophomore. ``Apparently a lot of kids knew all the sordid
details. There was bragging going on in the halls.''
   The arrests were made a day after WNBC-TV reported that no
arrests had been made despite the time that had passed.
   ``I think there was a coverup,'' said Josh Golin, a 17-year-old
senior. ``Until the media got called, this was going to be kept
quiet until it blew over.''
   Tate said the NBC report was not a fact, just that the
investigation took time.
   Kevin Scherzer is charged with one count of conpiracy to commit
sexual assault, and two counts each of aggravated criminal sexual
contact and aggravated sexual assault, said Assistant Prosecutor
Robert D. Laurino.
   Kyle Scherzer and Peter Quigley, 18, each were charged with
conspiracy and two counts of aggravated sexual assault, Laurino
said.
   Quigley was accused of cheering on the assault, although Tate
would not give details.
   The three were released on bonds. A 17-year-old male and another
student who has since turned 18 were charged as juveniles in all
three counts, Tate said.
   Two juveniles appeared in Family Court, said Ray Weiss, a
spokesman for Tate. Details of that appearance were unavailable
since those proceedings are closed to the public, Weiss said.
   The girl attends a special education program at West Orange High
School, and participates in extracurricular activites in Glen
Ridge, a community of about 8,000 located about five miles
northwest of Newark.
   School officials declined comment but issued a statement that
said school administrators had become aware of the attack through
``informal reports.''

<HEAD>Three Leading Soviet Hockey Players Free To Play In NHL</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three of the Soviet Union's finest ice hockey
players are now free to play with the National Hockey League, the
official Tass news agency reported today.
   The announcement that Vyacheslav Fetisov, Igor Larionov and
Sergei Makarov were discharged Wednesday from the Red Army _ whose
hockey team they represent in the Soviet league _ capped months of
unprecedented public squabbling within the world champion hockey
team.
   Tass said the three were discharged ``owing to reduction of
staff'' in the Red Army and ``are now free to sign contracts with
NHL or any other foreign clubs.''
   The agency did not mention the squabbles in its brief dispatch
and it was unclear how much of their hard-currency earnings the
players would be permitted to keep if they sign NHL contracts, as
expected.
   Other Soviet athletes competing internationally have been
required to turn over a share of their earnings or winnings to
Soviet sports organizations.
   Larionov last year publicly criticized the methods of national
team coach Viktor Tikhonov. In a long article in the weekly
Ogonyok, Larionov complained of rigorous training, inadequate
compensation and a lack of debate and discussion in the team.
   Fetisov quit the national team after a public row with the coach
over the treatment of his players. The two reconciled before the
World Championships in Stockholm in late April.
   The Soviets won the title but lost one of their best young
players, Alexander Mogilny, who defected to the United States.
   The defection of Mogilny, who has been contracted to play with
the Buffalo Sabres, prompted speculation in Moscow that the Soviets
would block freedom for other players to play for foreign teams.
   Today's announcement did not specify whether Fetisov, Larionov
and Makarov would continue to play for the Soviet national team.
   Fetisov is a standout defenseman, and Makarov and Larionov are
star forwards on the Soviet team.
   The New Jersey Devils have contract rights on Fetisov, the
Vancouver Canucks on Larionov and the Calgary Flames on Makarov.
   There was no immediate reaction from the three players.

<HEAD>Hollywood Discriminates Against Minorities, Women, Study Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Script writing in Hollywood is the
domain of white men and with a shift toward young white men,
according to a survey conducted by the Writers Guild of America.
   The survey found female and minority writers and writers over
age 40 receive fewer job offers and less pay for the meager scripts
they can sell. The study was issued Wednesday by the Writers Guild
of America, West.
   The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers rebutted
the survey, saying in a statement that it ``appears to contain
inaccurate information and certain of the conclusions do not appear
to be supported by industry data.''
   The producers' group also noted that more than 97 percent of the
WGA's membership is white.
   Richard Frank, president of the Disney Studios, also disputed
some of the findings of the WGA, which singled out Disney as having
the worst record of hiring minority and female writers.
   Frank admitted though that the company could improve its
minority hiring practices. ``I think we have to do better,'' he
said. ``I think it's all of our problem and we should address it.''
   The WGA leaders were less diplomatic, calling the pattern of
hiring prejudices morally repugnant.
   ``The statistics contained in this report are simply
unacceptable,'' said Brian Walton, executive director of the WGA
West. ``Inaction in the face of these continuing realities would be
a disgrace to our industry.''
   The employment survey of WGA West's 6,400 members shows that
women writers earn 63 cents for every dollar collected by their
male counterparts.
   Minorities account for 2 percent of film and television authors,
and older scriptwriters, once paid a premium for their screenplay
experience, now earn less than their younger colleagues, it said.
   WGA Board Member Mort Thaw said it was ``inconceivable'' that
scriptwriting experience now ``should be considered a detriment to
a career.'' He called the discriminatory hiring practices ``morally
repugnant and legally accountable.''
   Television programs not using any writers over age 40 were ``The
Popcorn Kid,'' ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``The Charmings,'' and
``Moonlighting.'' By comparison, more than 85 percent of the
writers on ``Dallas,'' ``Dynasty'' and ``The Colbys'' were over age
40.
   Yet the WGA said it would not seek to remedy the situation
immediately with legal action. Walton said a class-action lawsuit
against the studios would be expensive and perhaps ineffective.
   At the same time, guild leaders said that the WGA's 1989
Hollywood Writers Report reflected an irrefutable pattern of bias.
A 1987 survey by the Screen Actors Guild concluded that limited
film and television casting of black and Hispanic actors did not
reflect the ethnic mix of the United States.
   ``Typically, you're going to find most of your black writers on
black shows,'' said Vida Spears, a black writer who sits on the WGA
board. ``You're just not called in to other shows.''
   The study surveyed major film and network, syndicated and cable
television production from 1982 to 1987.

<TEXT>
   Half the editorial staff of a New York-based
Chinese newspaper quit after the publisher demanded they print his
commentary urging the use troops to restore order in Beijing, The
New York Times reported today.
   Four reporters, two editors and the editor in chief walked out
of The Center Daily on Wednesday, two hours before the paper's 10
a.m. presstime, the Times said.
   The Center Daily's publisher, Chaochu Fu, called on typists and
graphic editors to compose the front page to include his article,
which the editor in chief and others had objected to as reactionary.
   The chaos created by the walkout at The Center Daily led to the
paper's Wednesday editions being printed in two sections instead of
the usual four, the Times said.
   Fu had wanted to run the article calling for the government
crackdown on Tuesday, but editors refused. He then demanded the
article go in Wednesday's paper, precipitating the resignations.
   Powin Lin, the editor in chief, said he did not want the article
to appear ``because it is against the students, and the whole world
supports the students.''
   On Monday, Fu demanded publication of another commentary, which
he signed with a pseudonym that praised China's senior leader, Deng
Xiaoping, for his contributions, the Times said.
   Deng's resignation has been among the demands of Beijing
protesters.
   The pseudonymous commentary brought a storm of protest from
readers of The Center Daily and 100 threatening phone calls, Lin
said.
   Fu could not be reached for comment, the Times said.
   The Center Daily is published Monday through Saturday with a
circulation of 60,000 and is the second-largest Chinese newspaper
published in the United States.
   The paper was founded by Fu in 1981.

<HEAD>Tornadoes, Thunderstorms Push Across Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Rain fell today from the Great Lakes to the middle Mississippi
Valley as a line of thunderstorms pushed across the Midwest. A
tornado hit a campground in Springfield, Ill., early today
following several twisters in other states.
   Strong winds overturned a trailer near Appleton, Wis., killing a
32-year-old woman and injuring two relatives, officials said.
   A cold front moved into moist and unstable air, producing severe
thunderstorms Wednesday evening across the upper Mississippi
Valley. Tornadoes and high winds were reported in Iowa, Minnesota,
Missouri, Kansas, Wisconsin and Illinois.
   A twister that swept through the Abe Lincoln campground in
Springfield injured five people. Seven trailers were damaged and
two were overturned.
   A tornado also touched down at Riverton, Ill., downing power
lines that caused fires. Thunderstorm wind blew down two barns and
large trees and blew windows out of homes west of Elgin.
   Marshall County, Iowa, was one of the hardest hit areas in the
state, with severe damage reported. Three people suffered broken
bones and bruises when they were caught by tornado winds as they
tried to reach a storm cellar.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included 2 inches at Green Bay, Wis., and 1\ inches at Wausau, Wis.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes across the Ohio Valley and southeast Missouri to much
of Arkansas and Oklahoma; scattered showers and thunderstorms
across Mississippi, Alabama and southern Florida; showers from the
Pacific Northwest to North Dakota with some snow in Montana and
gusty winds from Wyoming across the Dakotas to the upper
Mississippi Valley.
   Predicted high temperatures: 50s and 60s from the central and
northern Pacific Coast across the northern and central Rockies and
much of the northern Plains to northern Minnesota; the lower 90s
over portions of West Virginia, Kentucky and Tennessee; 90s from
Georgia and Florida across the Gulf Coast states, most of Texas and
southern New Mexico to the desert Southwest. A few readings between
100 and 105 degrees were expected in southwest Texas and the desert
Southwest. Elsewhere, highs were to be in the 70s and 80s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 29 at
McCall, Idaho, to 86 degrees at Laughlin Air Force Base in Del Rio,
Texas.

   In nervous reaction to political developments
in China, share prices on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange suffered
their worst loss this morning since the worldwide market collapse
of 1987.
   Stocks rebounded in the afternoon but still ended the session
sharply lower.
   Brokers said investors reacted primarily to reports that
hardliners in the Chinese leadership, led by Premier Li Peng, had
won a power struggle against moderates, headed by Communist Party
Secretary General Zhao Ziyang.
   The market rebounded after China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs
announced that both Li and Zhao were still holding their posts.
   Investors in British-run Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese
rule in 1997 when a territorial lease expires, remain skittish over
political shifts in China even though the Chinese government has
promised to preserve the territory's social and economic lifestyle
for 50 years.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips lost 256.22 points to 2752.51,
down 58.92 points from Wednesday. It ended the morning session at
2,668.70 points, down 340.03 points from Wednesday's close,
suffering from the worst loss since the worldwide market collapse
of 1987.
   On Monday, the Hang Seng Index plunged 339.06 points, its worst
single-day loss since the worldwide market collapse in October
1987. It recovered 261.08 points on Tuesday, but fell 58.92 points
on Wednesday.
   Li imposed martial law in Beijing on Saturday in an attempt
suppress a student-led democracy movement that has swept China, but
the students have refused to quit their protest and citizens have
come to their aid.
   Zhao, who has been sympathetic toward the students, is regarded
by many as the only Chinese leader able to resolve the impasse
without violence.
   On Sunday, a crowd of Hong Kong Chinese estimated at between
400,000 and 1 million rallied in support of the pro-democracy
demonstrators in China in what was described as the largest protest
march in the British colony's history.
   There have been daily rallies since Li imposed martial law, and
on Wednesday an estimated 100,000 students, teachers, housewives
and workers demonstrated through streets, demanding the resignation
of the Chinese premier.

<TEXT>
   A man charged with manslaughter
for a skiing collision that killed an 11-year-old girl Feb. 17 has
pleaded no contest to a reduced charge and is expected to receive a
month in jail.
   The case was one of the first in Colorado in which a skier was
prosecuted for an accident on the slopes.
   Howard Hidle, 31, of North Richland Hills, Texas, entered the
plea to criminally negligent homicide Wednesday in the death of
Kari Meylor, 11, of Sioux City, Iowa. She was struck by Hidle's
skis at the Winter Park ski area.
   Hidle was skiing out of control when he hit Meylor, according to
a witness.
   Under a proposed plea bargain, Hidle would get a month a jail,
two months under house arrest and four years' probation, and would
be required to do 400 hours of community service, working with the
handicapped and critically injured.
   He also would be required to pay $15,000 to the child's family
and pay for a plaque to be erected in her memory at Winter Park.
   Judge Richard Doucette tentatively accepted the plea and set
sentencing for July 21.
   ``Every spare penny and every spare hour of the next four years
of his life will be spent on restitution and helping others,'' said
District Attorney Greg Long. ``We see this as a more positive
consequence (than jail).''

   A suspicious fire destroyed the landmark Pan
Pacific Auditorium, the streamlined, art deco arena where Elvis
Presley made his West Coast debut and Sonja Henie skated during the
1930s, officials said today.
   The auditorium, vacant since 1972, once boasted the world's
largest indoor ice rink and was host to the Ice Capades.
   The fierce, fast-moving fire broke out shortly after 7 p.m.
Wednesday and burned for about two hours.
   Fire officials said the blaze may have been started by
transients.
   ``The building has been abandoned for several years and sealed
up. As far was we know the power is cut, too, and there is and no
reason to assume natural causes,'' said Assistant Fire Chief Tony
Ennis.
   The building, which boasted a dramatic, multi-pillared facade,
was listed on the National Registry of Historic Buildings. It also
featured prominently in the recent film ``Miracle Mile,'' an action
thriller about nuclear apocalypse.
   ``Virtually everyone performed there,'' said Mike Venema, a
public relations man who noted that Presley gave his first West
Coast performance there in 1956.
   The building was created by the Works Progress Administration
during the Depression and ``is considered, was considered, one of
the finest examples of Art Moderne in existence. It's considered a
landmark piece,'' said Venema, who was working on behalf of a
preservationist seeking to save the building.
   A man who sought treatment for burns was questioned by fire
investigators.
   ``Right now, we just want to talk to him in regards to what he
observed at the time of the fire,'' Arson Capt. Gary Seidel said.
   Fire authorities had no immediate dollar estimate on the damage.

<HEAD>Advisers More Upbeat than Bush on Soviet Weapons Proposals</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts graf 5, White House chief, with Sununu quote.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House officials are putting a belatedly
upbeat cast on Moscow's latest weapons-reduction proposal, despite
skepticism voiced by President Bush toward Soviet intentions.
   Bush, in a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., on Wednesday greeted Soviet Leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's latest proposal for conventional arms reduction with
faint praise.
   ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming, and we hope to achieve
the reductions that we seek,'' Bush said.
   But he said Soviet-bloc nations still maintain a ``massive
advantage in conventional forces'' in Europe. He said various
Soviet promises to cut troops and tanks in eastern Europe are ``not
enough'' to erase that superiority.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu said today on ``CBS This
Morning'' that ``if Mr. Gorbachev gets his levels down to a point
where the offensive and sudden strike capability of the Soviet
Union is gone, then at that point you can begin negotiations.''
   While Bush was still on the platform handing out diplomas to
graduating cadets, his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
was telling reporters backstage that ``there are good signs here.''
   Past proposals by Gorbachev had been vague, Scowcroft said.
   He called the new Soviet proposals, outlined in Vienna on
Tuesday at an arms-negotiating session, ``very promising'' and
said, ``They've put more meat on it.''
   Asked if there had been a change in the administration's
assessment, Scowcroft said: ``No, it's a matter of appearance. The
president felt he appeared too negative before, so he's trying to
appear more positive now.''
   Bush leaves Friday for Europe, where he is to attend a NATO
summit meetng due to open Monday in Brussels.
   In advance of that session, the Soviets virtually accepted
Western demands that ceilings be set on troop levels in each East
European country as well as on Soviet forces overall, Bush
administration officials said.
   The officials also said Gorbachev agreed to negotiated limits on
Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary and Poland,
and to an overall limitation on the Red Army.
   However, Bush made little direct reference to these proposals in
his New London speech, even though his text was revised shortly
before he delivered it, well after the Soviet offer was publicized.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater also sought after
Bush's speech to portray the new Soviet offer in a positive light.
   Fitzwater praised the apparent willingness by the Soviets to
accept two central principles they had rejected previously: an
overall limit on the number of tanks, artillery and personnel
carriers, and a NATO-suggested rule limiting each country to no
more than 30 percent of the total.
   ``Those are major, major concessions,'' Fitzwater said.
   Asked why his and Scowcroft's tone appeared to be more upbeat
than Bush's, Fitzwater said: ``We all want to have the same tone.''
   In his speech, Bush said Gorbachev's proposed reductions, ``even
if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the numerical
superiority that the Soviet Union enjoys right now.''
   Later, Fitzwater said Bush's reference to Gorbachev's
``unilateral reductions'' largely dealt with earlier statements by
the Soviet leader, not the new proposal.
   Bush chose to mention it in the New London speech because ``it's
still a part of the whole scheme of things,'' Fitzwater said.
   If White House aides were trying to sound encouraging about the
new Soviet offer, they were less optimistic about resolving a
dispute that has split NATO _ on whether to negotiate reductions in
short-range nuclear weapons.
   Scowcroft, asked if there had been progress in reconciling West
German support for such talks with U.S. resistance to them, said
``not measurably.''
   He said that although talks are continuing, ``time is running
out'' to settle the dispute before the NATO summit.
   Bush, in his New London speech, said it is still necessary to
maintain a strong nuclear deterrence, and he challenged Gorbachev
to disclose accurate figures on Soviet military spending. ``Open
the ledger,'' Bush said.
   The president also took note of the pro-democracy demonstrations
in China, saying his administration ``will do all it can to
encourage'' those who ``are speaking the language of democracy and
freedom.''
   The coming 16-nation NATO summit seemed certain to be dominated
by Gorbachev's new proposal for limits on conventional forces.
   However, Bush, in an interview with a group of European
journalists, appeared to issue a warning to Western allies against
being lulled by the force of Gorbachev's arguments.
   While giving the Soviet leader high marks for public relations,
Bush declared, ``You do not make foreign policy based on the
personality or charm of an individual in another country. You do it
on facts.''
   Bush was interviewed by reporters from news organizations from
Britain, West Germany, Italy and Belgium.

<HEAD>Judge Stays Suffolk Ban on Some Plastic Packaging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEER PARK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled Suffolk County cannot
enforce its ban on plastic packaging until it studies the potential
effect on the environment.
   Supreme Court Justice Jack Cannavo on Wednesday stayed the law,
which would ban stores from packaging food in polystyrene or
polyvinyl. The law, which was to go into effect July 1, is opposed
by plastics manufacturers and food merchants.
   Wednesday's ruling requires the county Legislature to file a
complete environmental impact statement, which takes about three
months.
   The judge ruled that Suffolk County legislators failed to comply
with state environmental law when they approved the measure last
year after saying it would have do no significant harm to the
environment.
   The law would ban grocery bags, coffee cups, eating utensils and
fast-food containers made from either of the two plastics. Similar
bans have been adopted in St. Paul, Minn.; Minneapolis; Berkeley,
Calif., and Portland, Ore.
   Advocates of such bans say the non-degradable, non-recyclable
plastics take up too much space in landfills and might release
harmful emissions if incinerated.
   In a lawsuit filed last year, however, the Society of the
Plastics Industry and manufacturers of plastic food packaging said
paper products are a greater environmental threat than the plastic
items they would replace.
   They said that paper products dumped in landfills could pollute
ground water as the paper products decomposed.
   Suffolk County attorney Paul Sabatino said the county may appeal.

   Arab leaders extended their summit an
extra day as they sought agreement on a strategy to resolve the
conflict in Lebanon and on whether to support PLO chief Yasser
Arafat's peace moves.
   Traditional foes Iraq and Syria remained at loggerheads over the
presence of Syrian troops in Beirut as foreign ministers attending
the summit began drafting a final summit communique today. They
were to consider three separate resolutions drafted by Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and Jordan.
   Syria's President Hafez Assad told a marathon session Wednesday
night that he is willing to withdraw the 15,000 Syrian soldiers in
the Lebanese capital if an Arab force replaces them. But some of
the Arab leaders reportedly do not want to send troops to Syria's
war-plagued neighbor.
   The extraordinary summit, called mainly for the ceremonial
return of Egypt following a 10-year ostracism for making peace with
Israel, has turned largely into a quarrel over Lebanon.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, has
indicated his country wants to stop presiding over the six-nation
league committee designated to find an Arab compromise in Lebanon,
conference sources said.
   Heads of state met for 5{ hours Wednesday night but made no
headway in resolving the bitter dispute between Syria and Iraq.
   Syria supports Lebanon's Moslem acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss
against his Christian rival, Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Iraq is the only outspoken Arab supporter of Aoun.
   The Syrian soldiers are among 40,000 Syria deployed in Lebanon
under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Christian Lebanese and
their backers say Damascus broke that mandate by siding with
Moslems in recent sectarian fighting that has killed at least 359
people.
   At Wednesday night's meeting, Assad chided his fellow Arabs for
their inability to act on promises to dispatch a multinational Arab
peacekeeping force to Beirut. The Syrian leader threatened to leave
Beirut with only a Lebanese garrison _ or no garrison at all.
   Conference sources said Assad argued bitterly with Iraq's Saddam
Hussein through most of the session. ``Basically, Assad accused
Hussein of backing the anti-Moslem Christians, while Hussein
accused Assad of introducing Iranians into Lebanon,'' one source
said.
   Most Arab countries, including powerful Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
Jordan, reportedly are leaning toward the Iraqi position. This
leaves Syria in need of a compromise or facing isolation in the
Arab world.
   Despite the arguments, the 22-nation league summit has brought
some spectacular reconciliations, particularly between Libya's
leader, Moammar Gadhafi, and Egypt's leader, Hosni Mubarak.
   The Egyptian president told a Moroccan television interviewer
the readmission of the Arab world's most populous state ``will
undoubtedly help to bring the Arabs together.''
   Syria also challenged on Wednesday night the Palestine
Liberation Organization's recognition of Israel and the PLO's offer
to negotiate peace with the Jewish state. All the other Arab
leaders seem to accept PLO leader Yasser Arafat's move as
unpleasant but inevitable, sources said.
   President Bush has sent a message expressing hope the summit
will support peace initiatives from Israel and Arafat.
   The summit, originally scheduled to end Wednesday, was to end
with a public session late today.
   Tunisia's President Zine Abidine Ben Ali and Djibouti's Hassan
Gouled Aptidon quietly slipped out of town Wednesday to attend the
summit of French-speaking countries in Dakar, Senegal.

<HEAD>Privacy Seeking Dolphins Get Ulcers From Crowds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>

   Dolphins, like Greta Garbo, want to be alone
sometimes, scientitsts have learned.
   A study by the former chief of medicine at Baltimore's National
Aquarium says three dolphins developed ulcers shortly after
arriving at the newly-opened aquarium eight years ago because of
the big crowds that came to see them.
   ``We looked at everything we thought could be stressful to them,
such as the configuration of the tank, temperature, being watched
by the public, light levels and noise from the pumps,'' said
Michael K. Stoskopf, professor of comparative medicine at Johns
Hopkins University School of Medicine.
   ``The real problem with the exhibit was the people,'' said
Stoskopf, chief of medicine at the aquarium from 1981 to 1988.
   Kibby, Mimi and Aphrodite developed gastro-intestinal ulcers in
1981 within 50 days of arrival in Baltimore but recovered within
six months of their being flown to the Dolphin Research Center in
Grassy Key, Fla., in 1982, Stoskopf said.
   The Baltimore aquarium's multimillion-dollar dolphin tank was
never used for dolphins again.
   The animals didn't have enough room to get away from the crowds,
Stoskopf said. Researchers found later that by fleeing from the
crowds, the mammals congregated in a spot where noise from the
tank's pumps was loudest.
   Aquarium officials spent $250,000 on modications that reduced 98
percent of the noise, limited visitors to a maximum of 850 people
an hour and set firm closing hours to assure the animals at least
eight hours of rest every night.
   The lessons learned led aquarium officials to select beluga
whales as replacements and allow them more time to adjust to their
new home.
   The first two belugas spent a year in a quiet tank at the New
York Aquarium and were introduced slowly to larger numbers of
people.
   The belugas, Anore and Illamar, ``seem to be very happy,'' said
Robert L. Jenkins, aquarium director of operations and husbandry.
They were joined last summer by a third whale.

   Syrian troops exchanged gunfire with
pro-Iranian militiamen in south Beirut today, while Syrian and
Christian gunners skirmished on the city's dividing Green Line,
police said.
   One person was killed and 11 people were wounded in the clashes,
police said. The casualties brought the toll to 359 killed and
1,399 wounded since the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war broke out March 8.
   Also today, low-flying Israeli jets on reconnaissance sorties
drew anti-aircraft fire from Druse positions in mountains above the
Lebanese capital, a police spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. None of the planes was hit, police said.
   Militiamen of Hezbollah, or Party of God, Iran's main Shiite
Moslem ally in Lebanon, opened fire on a Syrian army jeep in Ouzai,
on Beirut's southern edge. ``Other Syrian troops in the area fired
back. The gunbattle sent panicky residents at a nearby cooking gas
distribution center fleeing,'' said the police spokesman. He said
one Hezbollah militiaman was killed in the 10-minute shootout. Five
militiamen were injured, the spokesman said.
   The Hezbollah is believed the umbrella group for underground
factions holding most of the 15 foreign hostages in Lebanon. The
longest held is Terry A. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,
1985.
   In another incident, six civilians were wounded in a sudden
half-hour flare-up with 106mm recoilless guns and rocket-propelled
grenades between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian troops and
Syrian forces. The clash occurred on the mid-city Museum crossing
that divides Beirut into Moslem and Christian sectors.
   Each side accused the other of starting the fight, which
violated a fragile cease-fire called by the Arab League May 11 to
halt the fighting between Christian forces and Syrian troops allied
with Druse militiamen.
   The fighting broke out weeks ago after Aoun ordered a blockade
of three illegal harbors run by Moslem militias.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
retaliated by shelling the Christian enclave. The Syrians are in
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Also today, Aoun reiterated that Syria should pull its troops
out of Lebanon to facilitate Israel's withdrawal from the
6-to-10-mile border enclave under its control for almost seven
years. Israel refers to the region in Lebanon as its security zone.
   Syria says it will pull out only after the Israeli army also
withdraws. Aoun criticized the United States for not pressuring
Syrian troops to leave.

   A military judge today acquitted four
soldiers of manslaughter in the death of a Palestinian man they
beat with a broomstick and rifle butts but found them guilty of
mistreating the detainee.
   Col. Emanuel Gross said the four, members of the elite Givati
Brigade, should have refused orders by their superiors to punish
detainees with beatings. He said they went further than those
instructions allowed.
   The case was seen as a test of the army's willingness to
discipline soldiers accused of brutality in the Palestinian
uprising.
   Maltreatment is a misdemeanor punishable by up to three years in
prison. Sentencing was set for June 15.
   The soldiers, none older than 21, were accused of beating to
death 42-year-old Hani el-Shami on Aug. 22 while conducting an
arrest in the Jabaliya refugee camp in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Gross found that they inflicted blows ``indiscriminately'' for
about 15 minutes, hitting the man all over his body with rifle
butts and a broomstick. One soldier jumped from a bed onto
el-Shami's stomach, he said.
   But he said the cause of el-Shami's death was not that beating
but a second beating administered by unknown soldiers at a military
base.
   The judge said the investigation was so poorly conducted it was
doubtful the soldiers who actually administered the fatal beating
could be identified.
   Had the defendants _ Pvts. Yitzhak Kibbudi, Aryeh Luchato and
Ron Hakhel and 1st Sgt. Yitzhak Adler _ been convicted of
manslaughter they could have received up to 20 years in prison.
   The judge also acquitted an army doctor, David Nussam, of
negligence related to his treatment of el-Shami after the beating.
   The verdict did not make any judgment on the policy of beating,
and the army withheld comment on whether charges would be brought
against the defendants' superiors.
   Beatings became widespread after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
in January 1988 authorized soldiers to beat Palestinian rioters to
prevent violent demonstrations.
   Commanders said many soldiers initially felt they were required
to break bones to punish rioters, but this was later clarified and
the number of beating cases fell significantly.
   The often brutal use of clubs has brought widespread criticism
of Israel, especially after pictures of soldiers beating
Palestinians were shown on foreign television news programs.
   The State Department has criticized Israel as failing to bring
soldiers who mistreat detainees to trial or being too lenient in
punishing them.
   In testimony at the trial in March, the army chief of staff, Lt.
Gen. Dan Shomron, acknowledged the army's policy was unclear and
left many ``gray areas'' open to soldiers' discretion.
   ``Deterrence is not the goal, overcoming violence is,'' Shomron
testified. ``But when someone stops resisting, that's a matter of
opinion.''
   Gross, in his 100-page verdict, reviewed the policy, which
allows soldiers to beat Palestinians to disperse demonstrators or
in pursuit of troublemakers. He said beating is to stop when a
Palestinian is in custody.
   Defense lawyers contended the troops had been following orders
given by a field commander, whom they said should bear
responsibility for any wrongdoing.
   Gross said the soldiers' commander had told them they could beat
Palestinians after arrest as punishment.
   ``The order given to them was manifestly illegal,'' the judge
said. ``The beating of someone who disturbs order for the purpose
of deterrence is not a military need. It is punishment.''
   The soldiers sat quietly through the two-hour reading of the
verdict and hugged their families afterward.
   Hakhel's sister Shira, 19, said she thought the trial was often
unfair. ``I think the trial was very hard,'' she told reporters.
``I think they just took them to set an example. These soldiers are
just kids.''
   The soldiers were among 67 officers and soldiers charged with
crimes ranging from assault and battery to manslaughter since the
start of the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising.
   Excluding the Givati soldiers, 36 of the troops have been found
guilty and received a maximum punishment of 21 months in jail.
Three others were acquitted. Cases of the others are still in
progress.

<HEAD>Asians' Criticism Spurs UC Berkeley To Change Freshman Admission
Standards</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY McGRATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERKELEY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by criticism from Asian
Americans, the University of California at Berkeley announced plans
today to put more weight on academics in admissions and also open
new spots for the poor.
   The proposal adds the poor to the list of groups given special
consideration, said Robert L. Bailey, a member of the committee
that drafted the proposals. Special consideration already is given
on the basis of race, ethnicity and other factors.
   If approved by the administration, the policy changes will take
effect by the fall of 1991.
   The changes were proposed in part because of complaints that
current policies discriminate against Asian American applicants.
   Changes in 1983-84 withdrew automatic admission for all
academically eligible students who were also poor, a program that
had benefited many Asian students, said sociology professor and
committee chairman Jerome Karabel.
   The new proposal would restore that policy.
   Asian Americans make up about 26 percent of Berkeley's
undergraduates. In California, 32.8 percent of Asian high school
graduates meet UC academic requirements, compared with 15.8 percent
of whites, 5 percent of Hispanics and 4.5 percent of blacks.
   Under the proposal, the proportion of freshmen admitted on the
basis of outstanding academic records alone would be raised from 40
percent to 50 percent.
   Another 45 percent would be selected from among groups given
special consideration, whether on the basis of race, ethnicity,
income or other factors. These students would still have to meet UC
academic standards.
   The proposal also would reserve 5 percent of the freshman spaces
for ``socioeconomically disadvantaged'' students, including blacks,
Hispanics, Indians, athletes and the disabled. Re-entry applicants,
typically older women, would also get special consideration.
   ``There will be more disadvantaged white and Asian students on
the campus,'' Karabel said. The addition of the economic
disadvantage category is ``in addition to affirmative action (based
on race), not in place of it'' and will not lower the number of
underrepresented minorities on campus, he said.
   The number of applicants to Berkeley has increased dramatically
since 1981, with more than 20,000 people applying for 3,400
freshman slots each year.

<HEAD>Vietnam Minister Predicts U.S. Ties May Be Normalized in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach today
predicted that Vietnam-U.S. relations will be normalized by 1990,
after Vietnam has ended its military occupation of Cambodia.
   ``The United States has repeatedly stated that relations with
Vietnam would be normalized after complete withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops from Cambodia,'' he said.
   ``I am of the opinion that the United States will keep the words
of a big country. The sooner it is normalized, the better, and it
is better late than never,'' Thach said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Asked to predict when relations would be normalized, he said a
reasonable guess would be next year. ``It is the end of the tunnel.
Now we can get out of the tunnel,'' he said of the Cambodian
conflict.
   The key player in any peace agreement is guerrilla leader Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, who has failed to fashion a deal in several
rounds of negotiations with the Vietnam-installed government in
Cambodia.
   Thach said Sihanouk often has changed his behavior and tactics
but always had the same objective _ to be head of state in
Cambodia. Since the pro-Vietnamese government has now offered him
that post, Thach said, ``I don't think he will miss the
opportunity.''
   The United States has not recognized the communist government
that has ruled since defeating the U.S.-backed South Vietnam
government in April 1975. The Carter administration came close to
normalizing ties in the 1970s, but that fell apart after Vietnam
invaded Cambodia in late 1978.
   The United States, which supports the resistance guerrillas, has
said it would not consider ending its trade and aid embargo or
normalizing ties until the last Vietnamese troops leave. Vietnam
has pledged to withdraw its remaining 60,000 to 70,000 troops by
Sept. 30.
   U.S. ties are crucial to Vietnam's top priority of drawing the
aid and investment to develop its economy, one of the world's
poorest.
   The United States and Vietnam in recent years have made rapid
progress on humanitarian issues, including the resettlement of
refugees and migrants to the United States and resolving the fates
of U.S. soldiers missing in action in Vietnam.
   Private U.S. citizens also have substantially increased contacts.
   Arnold Schecter, a leading American researcher, said on
Wednesday that Vietnam is allowing him to open an office in a Hanoi
medical school to study the health effects of Agent Orange, the
herbicide U.S. forces sprayed on Vietnam during the war.
   ``It is something of a breakthrough. Vietnam now is very
different and relatively easygoing compared to the extreme rigidity
that used to be there,'' said Schecter.
   Schecter, of the State University of New York at Binghampton,
just ended a visit to Vietnam.

<TEXT>
   Andreas Hillgruber, a controversial
German historian and catalyst of acrimonious debate on the
historical perspective of the Holocaust, died this month after a
long illness, Cologne University said today. He was 64.
   Hillgruber, a Cologne University professor and prolific author,
gained respect among historians around the world for his detailed
works on Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the Nazi dictator's
foreign policies.
   The university said he died May 8.
   Over the past three years, Hillgruber was involved in bitter
arguments among West German academicians over how best to
historically interpret the Holocaust, in which 6 million Jews were
killed.
   Hillgruber supported the view that historically speaking, the
Holocaust, while certainly atrocious, could not be singled out as
generally different from other atrocities, such as Josef Stalin's
reign of terror in the Soviet Union.
   In a controversial 1986 book titled ``The Destruction of the
German Reich and the End of European Judaism,'' he also praised the
German army's desperate last-ditch attempt in 1945 to fend off
Soviet troops, saying that gave civilians time to flee from
``revenge organs of the Red Army.''
   Hillgruber also argued that the Allies decided to crush Germany
long before they knew of Nazi atrocities.
   The book sparked anger among some West Germans, with many
newspapers calling it a scandal.
   But fellow historians say Hillgruber will long be respected for
his earlier work.
   ``He was an excellent historian, particularly on Hitler's
political and military plans, which were the basis for Hitler's
program to conquer the world,'' said Reinhard Meyers, a historian
at Muenster University.
   Some of Hillgruber's other works include ``The Second World War
1939-45: Goals and Strategies of the Great Powers;'' ``The
Destruction of Europe,'' and ``Hitler's Strategies, Policies and
Leadership From 1940-41.''

<HEAD>Burmese Rebels Welcome Call For Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Burmese guerrillas waging a 40-year war
for greater autonomy today welcomed their government's reported
willingness to negotiate a cease-fire.
   Thailand's army chief, Gen. Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, said
Wednesday that Burma has accepted in principle a Thai proposal to
mediate peace talks.
   There has been no immediate comment from the Rangoon government,
which late last year began intensifying its offensive against the
rebels.
   A Bangkok-based official of the National Democratic Front, which
combines 10 ethnic minority rebel groups and claims to control half
of Burma, said the group does not trust the Rangoon government of
Gen. Saw Maung. ``But if there is a chance (for peace), we must
take that chance,'' he said.
   ``Maybe with the pressure of the outside world or mediators,
there can be something coming out that is positive,'' said the
official.
   A representative of the Karen National Union, the largest
guerrilla group, said, ``A cease-fire is no problem. We are ready
... but we cannot believe in killers.'' Both officials asked not to
be named.
   Rangoon's troops have been hitting particularly hard at Karen
bases along the Thai frontier. Their offensive drew criticism from
U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY), who charged the Burmese
army attacks rebel bases without regard for the presence of
civilians.
   In a statement received in Bangkok today, Moynihan welcomed
Thailand's offer to mediate in the world's oldest civil war.
   ``It is my hope that Thailand will play a neutral and
constructive role ... and will quickly facilitate a cease-fire
among the warring parties,'' Moynihan wrote. He said negotiations
eventually should lead to free elections and discussions about a
federated union.
   Bangkok's proposal came after Burmese troops Saturday intruded
into Thailand's northern Tak province to attack a Karen base. The
soldiers occupied a Thai village and burned its marketplace before
being forced back.
   Burma's army commander, Lt. Gen. Than Shwe, told the Thai
delegation on Tuesday he regretted the incursion. But he also asked
Bangkok not to allow insurgents to take refuge in Thailand.
   Bangkok hopes to expand trade with Burma in line with Prime
Minister Chatichai Choonhavan's campaign to turn Southeast Asian
``battlefields into marketplaces.''

   Two engineers said they squabbled over who
was in charge shortly before their runaway freight train roared
into Montana's capital and caused an explosion that cut off power
to thousands of people.
   The testimony came Wednesday during the first day of a National
Transportation Safety Board hearing into the cause of the Feb. 2
accident, which caused about $10 million in damage. Testimony
continues today.
   The two engineers aboard the 49-car Montana Rail Link train said
they argued over who had authority over the westbound freight.
   Robert Estes was engineer of three ``helper'' engines pulling
the train over a mountain pass; Jody McCloud was engineer of the
train getting the assist.
   When his lead locomotive lost power and its cab heater failed,
Estes said he wanted to stop the train and move another locomotive
in front. McCloud said he offered to operate the train from the
cold, dead locomotive, but Estes said no.
   Estes said he told McCloud: ``It's the principle of the thing.
If anyone will operate this train from this locomotive, it will be
me.''
   In his testimony, McCloud said he opposed Estes' plan to stop
the train and switch locomotives. ``I just said, `I'll run the
train the rest of the way and you can go back and ride in the warm
unit,''' McCloud testified.
   Crewmen were realigning the locomotives when the 49 freight
cars, disconnected from the engines, rolled 11 miles down from the
Continental Divide and collided with other locomotives in Helena.
   Rail cars containing isopropyl alcohol and hydrogen peroxide
exploded, shattering windows for miles, severing power lines and
forcing the evacuation of 3,500 residents before dawn in minus-27
degree cold. Fifteen minor injuries were reported.
   An NTSB report cited uncertainty over who was responsible for
decisions on the train.
   ``As a result of the decision to move the engines around, there
was some confusion as to who was in charge of the train,'' the
report said. A final NTSB report on the accident is not expected
until late this year.

<HEAD>`Private Eye' Appeals For Help to Fight Record Libel Judgment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The satirical magazine ``Private Eye'' appealed
today for help in fighting a record $942,000 libel judgment.
   A jury on Wednesday ordered that sum paid to Sonia Sutcliffe,
wife of a mass murderer known as ``the Yorkshire Ripper,'' because
of Private Eye's false report that she sold her story to a tabloid
newspaper for $392,000 after carousing with its reporters at a
hotel.
   The award is the highest given by a jury in a British libel suit.
   Ian Hislop, the magazine's editor, admitted the report was
incorrect but said the magazine would go bankrupt if it had to make
the payment.
   ``By launching an appeal in this way we are making it clear that
we are fighting this absurd award which we want overturned,''
Hislop told a news conference. He was accompanied by actor-comedian
Peter Cook, a major owner of the 200,000-circulation magazine.
   Peter Sutcliffe was jailed for life in 1981 for killing 13 women
and attempting to kill five more. Mrs. Sutcliffe, 38, was not
implicated and since has separated from her husband.
   ``We shall apply for a speedy hearing,'' Hislop said. ``As we
understand it, this will mean a retrial. If the damages are not
substantially reduced then it looks as though we will have to
bankrupt the company.''
   He said he believed a fair settlement would have been about
$24,000.
   The amount awarded by the jury, Hislop said, was 100 times the
average compensation paid to three of Sutcliffe's victims.
   Private Eye first alleged in 1981 that Mrs. Sutcliffe had made a
deal with London's Daily Mail newspaper. In 1983, it repeated the
allegation. This year, after she sued, it published two more
articles that Mrs. Sutcliffe said implied she knew about her
husband's crimes.
   During the trial, Private Eye conceded there was no deal with
the Daily Mail but argued that Mrs. Sutcliffe had negotiated with
newspapers and was prepared to capitalize on her husband's crimes.
   The previous British libel award record was $831,000 awarded to
novelist Jeffrey Archer in 1987 against The Daily Star, a London
tabloid newspaper that alleged he gave money to a prostitute. He
said he never met her.

<TEXT>
   A West German pilot's daredevil landing in Red
Square prompted an embarrassed Soviet Union to try to buy U.S.
computers on the black market to bolster its air defenses, a
federal official charged.
   Patrick O'Brien, the Customs Service's top agent in Miami, made
the allegation Wednesday after a federal grand jury indicted five
people and two companies on smuggling charges.
   The smuggling operation was based in Belgium and involved $1.8
million worth of sensitive computer equipment, which was seized by
U.S. authorities before it was shipped overseas, he said.
   A Dutch citizen arrested last year while working for the network
provided the basis of the government's case, O'Brien said. Eddy
Haak told investigators that others in the network told him they
were working on behalf of East bloc countries to smuggle the
computers into the Soviet Union, the Customs agent said.
   U.S. computers were needed ``to shore up their air defense after
they found that it was ineffective and in disrepair,'' O'Brien
said. ``They discovered this when a West German pilot landed in Red
Square.''
   West German Mathias Rust, then 19, penetrated Soviet air
defenses in a small plane in 1987, buzzed the Kremlin and landed
the aircraft before a startled crowd in Red Square. Soviet
authorities imprisoned him for 14 months.
   Haak, recently convicted of federal charges of trying to divert
a similar system to Bulgaria, was lured to the United States and
arrested, O'Brien said. Customs agents then infiltrated the
smuggling ring.
   The indictment charges illegal export of sensitive U.S.
materials and conspiracy to export two Digital Equipment Corp. VAX
8820 computer systems through Canada to Bulgaria, a routine channel
for Soviet bloc procurements.
   The indictment named Steve Smylie, 39, and his wife, Carole, 36,
of Houston, and their Technology International Consultants Inc.;
Warren Wetstein of Toronto and his Asset Conversion Specialists
Inc., and computer company employees Jerry Blalock, 52, of Houston,
and Rick Parish, 44, of Dallas.
   The four Texans were taken into custody last week; Wetstein is
being sought. The suspected Belgian ringleader identity was not
released.
   The individual defendants could face up to 15 years in prison
and up to $6.5 million in fines. The companies face fines of up to
$6.8 million.

   The Foreign Office said today that four diplomats
at Czechoslovakia's Embassy are being expelled for ``activities
incompatible with their status,'' a euphemism for spying.
   Czech Ambassador Jan Fidler, who was summoned to the Foreign
Office this morning, was told the diplomats had 14 days to leave
the country.
   Fidler later issued a statement denying what he called the
``totally unfounded allegations.''
   Last week, Britain expelled eight Soviet diplomats and three
Soviet journalists who had been accused of spying, and Moscow
responded in kind.
   The Soviet government this week informed Britain that it must
reduce its diplomatic staff in Moscow to 205 people from the
present level of around 375.
   Sir John Fretwell, a senior British official who is political
director in the Foreign Office, told Fidler that he regretted
Czechoslovakia had not heeded a warning in September that such
activities would not be tolerated.
   The four who must leave by midnight on June 8 are Jan Pavlicek,
39, third secretary and press attache; Dr. Helena Krepelkova, 38, a
second secretary; Jan Sarkocy, 35, third secretary, and Rudolf
Kasparovsky, 35, technical adviser.

<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today unveiled an
ambitious plan to clean up the Dutch environment by the year 2010,
but it said 80 percent of the nation's forests may die even if the
measures are put into effect.
   The 250 pages of pollution-fighting measures are likely to be a
major issue in September elections. Controversy surrounding them
brought down the government headed by Premier Ruud Lubbers.
   The proposals will be taken up by the new government after the
elections.
   If passed, the government would spend about $2.9 billion yearly
by 1994 on the program, which aims to clean up the heavily polluted
Dutch environment by 2010. That expenditure would come on top of
the $3.5 billion already spent annually on environmental programs,
said Environment Minister Ed Nijpels.
   The package is expected to cost the average Dutch household $13
a month, he said.
   But even if the government meets the targets set by the plan,
only 20 percent of Dutch forests will be saved, the document warned.
   Environmental groups criticized the plan as ``mopping up water
from a running faucet,'' and said it was inadequate.
   The plan cited acid rain caused by car exhaust emissions,
coal-burning power stations and the farming industry's fertilizer
production as major causes of pollution in the Netherlands.
   Its recommendations include removing 7,000 toxic waste dumps
scattered around the Netherlands, cutting pesticide and fertilizer
use by 50 percent, and slashing industrial discharges by 75 percent.
   It said the emission of acidity-causing chemicals must be cut by
at least 70 percent.
   For the second successive day, Dutch Television broadcast an
official appeal for drivers to leave their cars at home as
pollution reached a dangerous high. Authorities were considering a
complete driving ban, according to the network.
   Lubers' Christian Democrats had hoped to include among the
measures the elimination of breaks for long-distance commuters. But
the ruling coalition's junior partner, the Liberal Party objected
to the measures and the subsequent battle split the government.

<TEXT>
   The Dixie Brewing Co., the Deep South's last
major independent beer maker, has filed for bankruptcy protection
to keep city tax officials from closing the 82-year-old brewery.
   The Chapter 11 petition, filed late Wednesday, apparently will
allow the company to continue operating while it reorganizes its
finances. Workers were seen entering the brewery this morning.
   Dixie received a letter Tuesday from the city giving it 24 hours
to come up with $375,000 in overdue sales and property taxes or
shut down.
   Stewart Walker, the city's chief administrative officer, said
the city had no way to arrange a compromise on the unpaid property
taxes.
   City spokeswoman Jinx Broussard on Wednesday said New Orleans
cannot grant an alcohol permit if a company has outstanding
obligations.
   ``Basically the city right now is just doing what it has to do
under the law. If they don't have an Alcohol Beverage Permit they
can't operate,'' she said.
   Earlier this month, the city gave Dixie's husband-and-wife
owners, Joseph Bruno and Kendra Elliott, an extension to pay water
bills of $215,000.
   New Orleans once had 13 breweries providing an estimated 3,000
jobs.
   Dixie survived Prohibition by dabbling in ice cream, sodas and a
near-beer named Dixco. When Prohibition ended, Dixie established
itself as the frontrunner among New Orleans beers.
   But in 1975, phenol fumes given off by a new flooring material
in the brewery's cellar seeped into the brewing water and gave the
beer a bad taste. Beer drinkers switched to other brands and Dixie
sales plummeted, never to recover.
   Dixie's share of the local beer market, which once topped 20
percent, has dropped to less than 1 percent. The brewery employs
about 100 workers

<TEXT>
   A regional court today sentenced a
white ex-policeman to hang for killing seven blacks and an Indian
man in two shooting sprees he took pride in and viewed as the start
of a race war.
   Justice Louis Harms said there were no extenuating circumstances
to spare Barend Strydom, 23, from the gallows.
   The killings were committed ``in an unfeeling and cold-blooded
manner that I have never before experienced or heard of,'' Harms
said. ``Mass murder or racial murder will not be tolerated by this
court.''
   The case has been one of the most dramatic in South Africa, with
relatives of the black victims and white extremists supportive of
Strydom crowding into Pretoria Supreme Court over the past 10 days
to hear detailed testimony about the defendant's racist beliefs.
   After the sentencing, the white-supremacist Boerestaat Party
announced the start of a campaign to seek clemency for Strydom. The
party leader, Robert von Tonder, described the defendant as ``a
sensitive Afrikaner patriot.''
   After standing impassively for an hour while the judge read his
ruling, Strydom gulped a glass of water when the sentence was
pronounced.
   He strode into the packed courtroom smiling broadly, waving to
friends and shaking hands with supporters. After the sentencing he
was escorted swiftly to a police van and driven to a death row cell
at Pretoria Central Prison.
   The judge convicted Strydom last week of killing seven people
and wounding 15 blacks in a rampage on the sidewalks of downtown
Pretoria on Nov. 15.
   A week before the Pretoria killings, Strydom killed a black
woman and wounded another at a squatter camp in what he described
as a practice attack to determine if he was ready for a
larger-scale massacre.
   Strydom had acknowledged that he smiled as he shot his victims,
telling the court, ``I'm a friendly person.''
   The judge gave Strydom eight death sentences plus 30 years in
prison for 16 counts of attempted murder. No execution date was set.
   Police vehicles blocked streets leading to the court. Scores of
officers stood guard inside and outside the courtroom, packed with
about 100 spectators. More than 200 people, most of them black,
waited in a small park across from the courthouse.
   Strydom had testified that he had fired the first shots in a
``war of freedom'' on behalf of whites threatened by the country's
black majority. ``I'd do it again,'' he told the court.
   His father, also a former policeman, testified that he believed
blacks were animals, not humans.
   Both father and son belong to the Afrikaner Resistance Movement,
a neo-Nazi group that seeks to establish a whites-only state. Other
members of the movement attended the trial to show solidarity with
Strydom.
   Psychiatrists appointed by the state concluded that Strydom was
sane and responsible for his actions. Strydom's lawyer, Johan
Englebrecht, argued Wednesday that the defendant's guilt was
lessened by various factors, including the racist ideology he
learned from his father.
   However, the prosecutor, Paul Fick, said South African judges
repeatedly had ruled that political motives could not be accepted
as extenuating circumstances.
   Under South African law, the death sentence is mandatory in
murder cases unless the judge determines that there were mitigating
circumstances.
   Also today, three black men in Pretoria prison's death row were
hanged, bringing to 24 the number of executions this year.
   Those hanged were: Simon Mbatha, 35, convicted of murdering two
white policeman in March 1987; Patrick Mosomi, sentenced last year
for murdering a black woman; and Abraham Mngomezuluh, who was
convicted of killing a black man in Soweto in 1987.

   The battle of the Berettas ended today with an

   Pier Giuseppe Beretta, chairman of the weapons maker Fabbrica
D'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A., and General Motors Corp. Chairman
Roger Smith signed an agreement allowing GM to use the Beretta name
for the Chevrolet Beretta car.
   In exchange, the automaker agreed to donate $500,000 to the
Beretta Foundation for Cancer Research and Treatment.
   The 463-year-old Italian company sued GM last year over use of
the Beretta name after the automobile was introduced in 1987.
   During today's signing ceremony in Italy, Smith presented
Beretta with a Chevrolet Beretta GTU Coupe, which carries a base
price of $15,610 before a $1,000 rebate. In return, Beretta gave
Smith a rifle and a shotgun.
   A statement issued here by GM didn't say how much the weapons
were worth.

<TEXT>
   The Navy has not reported at least three
accidents involving nuclear weapons, according to documents
released by an environmental group and an interview with a retired
admiral.
   In the most thoroughly documented case, a raging fire aboard the
USS Belknap in the Mediterranean Sea in 1975 came within 40 feet of
nuclear weapons aboard the missile cruiser, according to a military
cable released by the Greenpeace environmental group.
   Joshua Handler, director of the Greenpeace Nuclear Free Sea
campaign, said at a news conference today that Pentagon
authorities' ``record on public disclosure of naval accidents is as
bad as their accident record itself.''
   Despite the disclosures, the Navy maintained its policy of
refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on its
vessels.
   The admiral who commanded the carrier task force to which
Belknap belonged confirmed the incident and told The Associated
Press that he had witnessed two additional accidents that
threatened nuclear weapons aboard ships.
   ``I have seen firsthand a live nuclear weapon caught in a fuel
fire. I have seen a nuclear weapon crushed in a hoist, an elevator
that carries nuclear weapons to the flight deck,'' said retired
Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, who commanded the task force that
included the Belknap.
   ``The military does not announce every time they have had a
dicey accident. They do so when the knowledge becomes public,''
Carroll said.
   In one case, he said, fire broke out on the hangar desk of an
aircraft carrier, and ``the crew battled the fire, spraying water
on an airplane carrying a nuclear bomb, trying to keep it cool
until they could get the thing off.''
   In the three accidents, he said, ``we never faced the danger of
nuclear explosion. ... The warheads are configured in such a way
they a fire could not cause a nuclear detonation. But it could
spread a lot of radiation around.''
   He declined to disclose further details of the elevator and
aircraft fire incidents, but was willing to discuss the Belknap
accident because Greenpeace released a previously classified
document describing the event.
   The collision in the Mediterranean between the Belknap and the
aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy was widely reported, but the
Navy did not note the nuclear aspect of the accident at the time or
in lists released in 1981 and 1986 of incidents involving nuclear
weapons.
   William Arkin, a naval analyst working with Greenpeace, said,
``The Navy's purposeful exclusion of the Belknap accident is a
violation of the public's right to know.''
   Eight sailors were killed and 46 were injured when the Belknap
and the Kennedy collided 70 miles off Sicily on Nov. 26, 1975.
   A cable written by Carroll hours after the accident alerted
superiors to the ``high probability that nuclear weapons'' on the
missile cruiser ``were involved in fire and explosions subsequent
to the collision.''
   Aviation fuel from the carrier rained down on the cruiser,
knocking out its firefighting equipment.
   ``It was pretty hairy out there. As we viewed the Belknap, it
seemed to be a fairly total involvement. As it turned out, the fire
gutted the midships,'' Carroll said.
   The destroyer USS Claude V. Ricketts came alongside, in heavy
seas and driving rains, and helped extinguish the fire, the
commander of the Ricketts, Robert C. Powers, said in a 1976 article
published in the U.S. Naval Institute Proceedings.
   Carroll's cable, stamped ``Secret,'' said that an unknown number
of W-45 warheads were aboard the cruiser and alerted the Atlantic
Command ``of high probability that nuclear weapons on USS Belknap
were involved in fire and explosions subsequent to the collision.''
   The cable said officers aboard the Kennedy had ``no direct
communications with Belknap at this time. No positive indications
that explosions were directly related to nuclear weapons. No repeat
no Kennedy weapons involved. Fires on Belknap diminishing at this
time.''
   It also said ``casualties recovered thus far show no repeat no
exposure to radiation'' but that ``monitoring teams and medical
personnel alerted possibility of contamination.''
   A man who identified himself as a former sailor from the Belknap
said today he had suffered severe burns fighting the fire and had
been checked for radation for the next three years by Navy doctors.
No traces of radiation were found, said the sailor, who telephoned
The Associated Press after reading accounts of the disclosures.
   Carroll, now deputy director of the liberal Center for Defense
Information in Washington, said, ``The idea that this is a `broken
arrow' never released is incorrect. I sent subsequent messages that
the nuclear weapons were not endangered.'' A ``broken arrow'' is an
accident involving nuclear weapons.
   Arkin said other documents showed that there were six W-45
warheads, used by Terrier anti-aircraft missiles aboard the
Belknap. He said he based his 40-foot estimate on photographs of
the damaged ship; Carroll said that estimate was correct.
   The ship, severely damaged, was decommissioned, returned to the
Philadelphia Navy Yard, and recommissioned after four years of
repair work.
   The Navy, responding to Arkin's report, said no nuclear weapons
were involved in the fire, and adhered to its policy of refusing to
comment on reports of nuclear weapons aboard vessels.
   ``It is U.S. government policy neither to confirm nor deny the
presence of nuclear weapons on ships, aircraft or U.S. military
installations,'' said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman. ``That
policy applied in 1975 as it does now.''
   Cole confirmed that the Belknap was capable of carrying Terrier
anti-aircraft missiles, a weapon that can be armed with nuclear or
conventional warheads, but said, ``The 1981 Department of Defense
report is correct in that no nuclear weapons were affected by the
1975 Belknap-Kennedy collision.''
   On May 8, Arkin and Greenpeace disclosed that a hydrogen bomb
accidentally lost off the carrier USS Ticonderoga in 1965 was 80
miles off Okinawa, now part of Japan, rather than ``more than 500
miles from land ... at sea in the Pacific,'' as disclosed in the
Pentagon's 1986 list of accidents involving nuclear weapons.

   The instigator of the ethic charges that have
House Speaker Jim Wright fighting for his political life said today
that Wright should not be permitted to make a political deal to
resolve the case against him.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, the Georgia Republican who parlayed his
ethics campaign against Wright into Gingrich's election as House
minority whip, said Wright either should fight the charges to their
conclusion or resign from Congress.
   ``He does deserve his day in court,'' Gingrich said on ABC-TV's
``Good Morning America'' program. ``He deserves a full and fair
opportunity to defend himself... If he wants to end the process, he
can do that by resigning from Congress. But if he's going to stay,
I don't think that any kind of political deal should be made.''
   The House ethics committee adjourned Wednesday until June 1
after reportedly refusing to accept a deal offered by Wright's
attorneys in which the committee would dismiss the most serious
charges against Wright in exchange for his resignation as speaker.
   If Wright resigned from Congress without such a deal, the
investigation would end because the committee's jurisdiction
extends only to members of Congress. But Wright would not be able
to claim exoneration on any of the charges.
   Gingrich said in an interview Wednesday night that the
committee's refusal to accept the deal leaves Wright with only
three options _ resign from Congress, fight the charges to the end,
or step aside in favor of an interium speaker who would not be a
threat to his job should he be exonerated by the committee.
   ``But the notion that he has some standing to go in and plea
bargain with the ethics committee is nonsense,'' he said.
   Gingrich said he was not involved directly in any of the
negotiations Wednesday. But he said his impression of the talks was
that ``a very clever effort was made to run something through the
committee before the committee had time to think about it and
examine all of the ramifications.''
   He said the committee's decision to adjourn until June 1 sends
``a very powerful signal'' that it does not intend to negotiate
with Wright over the charges pending against him.
   Gingrich is facing an ethics complaint filed by Rep. Bill
Alexander, D-Ark., after Gingrich initiated the investigation of
Wright. The complaint, still pending before the committee, contends
that a partnership created by Gingrich to promote his 1984 book,
``Window of Opportunity,'' violated House rules.

<HEAD>Trial Beginning in Suit Against Actor in Drowning Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jury selection has begun in a lawsuit
over from a woman's accidental death 2{ years ago in a hot tub on
Dustin Hoffman's estate.
   Five of the eight jurors needed were chosen Wednesday.
   Sheila Cruse Fionda, 43, was found floating face down in the hot
tub at Hoffman's Roxbury estate in 1986. The actor was not there at
the time. The woman had gone out to dinner with the estate's
caretaker the previous evening.
   State Police concluded that Ms. Fionda drowned accidentally; her
blood-alcohol level was three times the legal limit for driving in
Connecticut.
   Her former husband, A. Joseph Fionda, sued Hoffman, the
property's former caretaker, the tub installer and the manufacturer
of its heater.
   The suit does not specify amount of damages sought, but Fionda's
attorney, Robert Guendelsberger, said last year that the family
would settle for $200,000.
   The suit accuses Hoffman of failing to have the area of the hot
tub fenced, failing to ensure that the water did not get too hot
and failing to instruct the caretaker about the safe use of the tub.
   Hoffman is in a play in London, and his attorney, Jon Berk, said
he would not return to the United States until September.

<HEAD>KGB Alleges `Illegal Acts' By Expelled British Journalists</HEAD>

Tass dispatch, quotes on Soviet expelled. No Pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The KGB said today it has evidence that three
British journalists expelled last week engaged in spying. It was
the first time the Soviets had published detailed accusations
against the three.
   ``Competent organs possess information that testifies to the
involvement of these journalists with British intelligence
services,'' KGB spokesman Vladimir Strunin told a news conference.
   The British journalists _ Jeremy Harris of the British
Broadcasting Corp., Ian Glover-James of Independent Television News
and Angus Roxburgh of The Sunday Times _ have denied wrongdoing.
   Glover-James and Roxburgh could not immediately be reached by
telephone to comment on the KGB charges. Harris declined comment
until he had read the Tass news agency's report on Strunin's
allegations.
   On Saturday the journalists, along with eight British diplomats
based in Moscow, were given 14 days to leave the Soviet Union.
Britain said the move was revenge for Britain's decision on Friday
to expel 11 London-based Soviets _ eight diplomats and three
journalists _ accused of spying.
   The most serious accusation leveled today was against Roxburgh.
The KGB accused him of trying to enlist a Soviet citizen to obtain
information on unspecified ``government installations.''
   ``To this end, (Roxburgh) gave him equipment for listening and
recording telephone conversations and also promised to pay a
monetary reward for information that was interesting to him,'' the
KGB spokesman alleged.
   Strunin said the listening device was disguised as a household
appliance and could be also used to capture low-frequency magnetic
fields generated by telephone lines, cables and computers.
   Roxburgh also was accused of violating regulations that restrict
foreigners' travel in the Soviet Union.
   In particular, Roxburgh allegedly traveled to the southern
resort city of Yalta in July without giving the required 48 hours'
advance notice to the Foreign Ministry.
   ``Soon afterward, Roxburgh was detained during an attempt to
enter a closed area in the Moscow region,'' the KGB charges said.
   Harris ``on several occasions tried to enter zones closed to
foreigners,'' according to the allegations. ``There is information
that he used technical means for the gathering of information in
those areas.''
   Glover-James was accused of ``demonstrating on numerous
occasions a heightened interest in installations of a military
character that is unjustified for a journalist.''
   He was also accused of repeatedly violating the regulations on
foreigners' travel in Soviet territory.
   Since the expulsions, the Soviets have said the number of
Britons allowed to work in Moscow will be cut from 375 to 205 _ the
number of Soviets permitted to work in Britain.
   In a separate Tass dispatch, Leonid Kravchenko, the official
Soviet news agency's general director, denied that the Tass London
correspondent was involved in espionage and said his expulsion
order was ``regrettable.''
   In a letter to British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe,
Kravchenko said correspondent Igor Peskov was a professional
journalist, not a spy.
   ``Nothing in his activities has contradicted either British or
international law, nor could they do any harm to the security
interests of Britain,'' Kravchenko said in the letter, quoted by
Tass.
   He said the expulsion of Peskov was at odds with improved
Soviet-British relations and could hinder future positive
developments between the countries.
   The dispatch did not mention the other two Soviet journalists
expelled.

<HEAD>GAO Study Sees Serious Problems In Air Traffic Control System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's air traffic controllers complain
they are handling too many planes, working too many hours and
suffering from low morale in a system that has changed little since
the same problems were cited four years ago, a congressional report
said today.
   ``In short, the (Federal Aviation Administration,) simply
ignored recommendations for change,'' said Rep. Guy V. Molinari,
R-N.Y., referring to the General Accounting Office study that
showed 43 percent of controllers characterize their morale as low.
   FAA officials said their own surveys painted a brighter picture.
   The GAO study said that while most controllers were concerned
about working conditions, the increasing traffic they have to
handle and ``other aspects of air traffic control that affect
system safety and operating efficiency,'' their supervisors were
far less concerned.
   The survey, released at a House subcommittee hearing, was based
on 5,098 questionnnaires filled out by controllers and supervisors
at the FAA's largest facilities late last year.
   Molinari, ranking minority member of the Public Works and
Transportation subcommittee on investigations and oversight, said
the results were ``nearly a replica'' of a similar 1985 GAO survey
and show that many of the problems that contributed to a 1981 air
traffic controllers strike still exist.
   More than 11,000 controllers were fired for the illegal walkout,
and Molinari said the system still has 3,600 fewer fully qualified
controllers than it did before the strike. The FAA says the work
force totals 16,464, with 9,689 classified as ``full performance
controllers.''
   Molinari said the number of full performance controllers has
dropped by 150 in the last six months.
   ``The FAA has failed in these eight years to rebuild the air
traffic control system adequately and they have failed to heed the
views of controllers and supervisors,'' he said.
   GAO official Kenneth M. Mead said the Flight Safety Foundation
concluded from the survey that the system ``is not unsafe but that
the margin of safety _ that undefined limit beyond which the system
would no longer be safe _ remains less than desirable.''
   The private foundation acts as a consultant to the GAO, which is
the investigative arm of Congress.
   The FAA's acting administrator, Robert E. Whittington, told the
subcommittee that the agency's own surveys of controllers show some
encouraging results. He gave figures showing that most controllers
believe their supervisors communicate honestly with them, believe
their training is adequate and believe they are treated fairly
regardless of age, sex or race.
   Whittington said safety records also indicate that the system
works well.
   He quoted statistics showing that runway incursions, reported
near-collision and operations errors all decreased between 1986 and
1988.
   Meanwhile, the National Transportation Safety Board said the FAA
should act immediately to improve air traffic procedures in the
crowded skies over southern California.
   The NTSB, in a letter to the FAA, its investigation of air
traffic in that region cited a variety of problems, including
excessive overtime, poor training and understaffing of controllers.

   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has
removed the powerful army intelligence chief who handed out
millions of dollars in American military assistance to Afghan
rebels, officials said today.
   Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, director general of Inter Services
Intelligence, was transferred to army headquarters in neighboring
Rawalpindi, a Defense Ministry spokesman said on condition of
anonymity. He reportedly has been replaced by retired army general
Shamsur Rahman Kallu, said the spokesman.
   Gul gave the military assistance to the Afghan anti-communist
resistance, headquartered in Pakistan. Both Pakistan and the United
States have helped finance guerrillas fighting the Soviet-supported
Afghan government.
   But Gul came under fire from moderate Afghan guerrilla groups
for giving most aid to hard-line Islamic fundamentalists, the
Hezb-e-Islami, led by Gulbadin Hekmatyar.
   He was also apparently behind the guerrilla's much-criticized
attack on the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad after Soviet troops
ended their nine-year intervention in Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
Although some guerrilla leaders predicted Jalalabad would fall
quickly, the fighting has reached a stalemate.
   Gul was appointed by Pakistan's late president and military
leader Mohammed Zia Ul-Haq, who was killed last year in a plane
crash that investigators said was sabotage.
   Zia retired Kallu, the reported new army intellegence head,
after Kallu suggested Zia should forfeit the post of army chief of
staff while ruling the country as president.
   Analysts, who requested anonymity, said Gul's removal appears to
indicate Ms. Bhutto's growing strength in Pakistan, the first
Moslem nation in modern times to be governed by a woman.

   Most of the deputies who have come to Moscow for
the new Soviet parliament are traveling by bus, eating ordinary
hotel food and must survive on about $24 a day.
   In an article reflecting sensitivity to the issue of privileges
for the powerful, the Communist Party daily Pravda said
rank-and-file representatives in the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies aren't getting special treatment, despite rumors
to the contrary.
   Citizens are concerned whether their representatives are
``getting special food parcels, black Volga sedans, presents and
special passes for the GUM central department store,'' the
newspaper said Thursday.
   The newspaper made no mention of existing privileges for top
party and government officials, many of whom are members of the new
Congress. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other members of the
ruling Politburo are entitled to chauffeured Zil limousines,
country houses, access to special food packets, stores, medical
care and other services not available to ordinary Soviets.
   Lesser officials may get smaller cars and somewhat limited
special treatment.
   Many successful candidates for the congress, notably political
maverick Boris N. Yeltsin, campaigned against special privileges
for top officials.
   ``Each deputy is paid a per diem of 15 rubles,'' Pravda said.
``The offered transportation is mainly by bus, but a lot of
deputies prefer to walk because hotels are located near the
Kremlin. In special cases, a car may be provided.''
   As for food, Pravda said, ``it is the same as it always was at
restaurants and buffets of the Moskva and Rossiya hotels.''
   The only ``perks'' for the deputies are free telephone calls to
their constituencies and well-stocked book stalls, the newspaper
said.
   ``Although some deputies were violently against even such a
small privilege,'' Pravda said, ``others believed that it might be
good for deputies from far places to bring a few good books to
their small villages and towns where such books are in short supply.

<TEXT>
   American doctors returning from a week in Soviet
Georgia said today they believe the Soviet army used a World War
I-era toxic gas against demonstrators in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi last month.
   Soviet officials have acknowledged that two forms of tear gas
were used to disperse a crowd of 8,000 to 10,000 holding an
all-night demonstration in Tbilisi's Lenin Square on April 9. At
least 20 people died during and after the protest.
   The American delegation from Physicians for Human Rights, a
1,300-member group based in Somerville, said it concluded on the
basis of interviews, medical records and videotapes that a third,
more potent gas was probably used.
   The group identified the gas as chloropicrin, first used during
World War I in 1916. Also known as nitrochloroform, it was once
used for crowd control in the United States but is now banned
because of its toxicity, the group said.
   The chemical, which causes potentially lethal chest irritation,
can be used in the United States only by licensed applicators as a
fumigant against insects, the group said.
   According to Georgian health officials, about 4,000 people
sought hospital treatment after the demonstration.
   Dr. Jonathan Fine, executive director of Physicians for Human
Rights, said the delegation concluded that ``the majority of those
hospitalized were probably suffering from the lingering effects of
toxic gas exposure.''
   But, he said, there is no conclusive evidence that chloropicrin
caused any of the deaths.
   Physicians For Human Rights was invited by Andrei Sakharov, the
Soviet physicist and human rights activist, and top Georgian health
officials to send a delegation to investigate the alleged use of
toxic chemicals in Georgia.
   The delegation, which spent May 17-22 in Soviet Georgia,
consisted of a leading toxicologist, Dr. Barry H. Rumack, director
of the Rocky Mountain Poison Center in Denver, Colo; Dr. Jennifer
Leaning, chief of emergency services for the Harvard Community
Health Plan in Cambridge, and Dr. Ruth A. Barron, a psychiatrist at
McLean Hospital in Belmont.
   The delegation met with officials of the Georgian Ministry of
Health and a large number of doctors who treated people injured in
the demonstration. The group also examined pathology reports of 20
known deaths, examined photographs and videotapes of the
demonstration and inspected canisters of gas allegedly used by
troops.

   The Foreign Ministry has selected Ryohei Murata as
the new ambassador to the United States, replacing Nobuo Matsunaga,
officials said Thursday.
   Murata, administrative vice foreign minister, is expected to
replace Matsunaga in September, said a ministry official, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Matsunaga became ambassador to the United States in January
1985, after serving as deputy foreign minister.
   The Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported the decision came because
the ministry thinks it is a good time for the personnel change now
that the Bush administration has settled in.
   The ministry has also decided to promote Takakazu Kuriyama,
deputy vice minister for political affairs, to administrative vice
minister in July, according to the Foreign Ministry.
   Hisashi Owada, ambassador to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development will take Kuriyama's place, the

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce today
defended his role in a subsidy program under investigation for
favoring well-connected Republicans, saying he tried to kill the
program and suggesting that Democrats also benefited from it.
   Pierce's comments before a congressional committee provoked an
angry, sometimes shouted exchange with Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
who charged that the former Reagan administration officials was
trying to ``deflect some of the blame'' by making ``irresponsible
statements'' he could not back up.
   Pierce's appearance before a House Government Operations
subcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigative
report sharply criticized the management of a Department of Housing
and Urban Development program that provided indirect subsidies for
rehabilitation of privately owned low-income housing projects.
   Current HUD Secretary Jack Kemp suspended further awards under
the program pending a review.
   Pierce, who headed HUD throughout all eight years of the Reagan
administration, testified that he recommended Congress kill the
so-called mod-rehab program.
   He acknowledged that department officials used their discretion
in awarding subsidies to selected developers, but he said that was
because Congress in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-share
allocation procedures.
   The HUD inspector general said his audit found a pattern in
which former department officials and other well-connected
Republicans received a large share of project awards either as
developers or as consultants to developers. Among those cited was
former Interior Secretary James Watt, who was reported receiving a
$300,000 consulting fee on a Maryland project.
   Pierce said the report failed to mention Democrats who
benefited. He added: ``It should be interesting to see how much
those affiliated with the Democratic Party benefited from this
program, since strong _ and I am sure very intelligent _ Democratic
Congresses repeatedly appropriated funding ... when the Republican
administration repeatedly sought to terminate it.''
   Pressed by Frank, Pierce said he believed Democrats benefited
but could not name any.
   ``You've made an irreponsible staement and you're trying to
filibuster your way out of it,'' Frank charged.
   Subcommittee Chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., read from a memo he
said the inspector general sent Pierce in 1988 warning him of
problems in the program.
   Pierce said he had previously altered the selection process and
did not respond to the inspector general's suggestion because the
earlier changes needed time to work. He said he followed advice of
other aides.
   ``Those people know something too,'' Pierce said. ``The
inspector general is not God.''
   Pierce said he met with Watt on the Maryland project. But he
said he referred Watt to the appropriate office at HUD and told him
only that ``we'd look very carefully at his project.''
   ``No promises were made to him. How he got his money, I didn't
ask him that,'' Pierce said. ``Whatever he said, I really paid very
little attention to him.''
   The developer who hired Watt on the Maryland project told the
subcommittee that Watt was hired ``to move and unsnarl the
bureaucracy throughout the development process.''
   ``Mr. Watt can get phone calls returned at HUD. I can't,'' said
Judith S. Siegel, president of Landex Corp.

   An anonymous bomb threat forced a Soviet jetliner
with 160 people aboard to make an emergency landing shortly after
takeoff from an airport in remote Central Asia, Tass said Thursday.
   The call was traced and the caller, who made the threat as a
joke, was arrested, the official news agency said.
   The Tupolev-154 had taken off Wednesday from Dzhambul, in the
Kazakstan republic 1,500 miles southeast of Moscow, when the
airport's information service received a telephone call warning of
a bomb on board, Tass said.
   ``By the time the aircraft returned to the airport, the security
forces were on full alert, ready to check the plane and trying to
trace the caller,'' said the city's militia chief, Maj. Gen. M.T.
Bersenev.
   A search of the aircraft found no bomb, and after a five-hour
delay, the passengers took another flight, he said.
   Airport security traced the call to V.V. Fan, 21, who was seeing
relatives off at the airport, Tass said.
   ``He made the call for fun and had no idea of the
consequences.'' It said Fan will have to pay all costs incurred by
the hoax.

   Syrian troops battled pro-Iranian
militiamen and Christian army units Thursday in separate clashes
that left one person dead and 11 wounded in Beirut.
   Low-flying Israeli warplanes cracked the sound barrier over
Druse-held mountains southeast of the capital, but avoided
anti-aircraft fire, police said.
   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun said Syria should pull
its troops out of Lebanon to ease Israel's withdrawal from a border
strip it has controlled for almost seven years.
   Police said militiamen of the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem
Hezbollah, or Party of God, opened fire on a Syrian army jeep near
the Iranian Embassy in the seaside Ouzai district on Beirut's
southern edge.
   ``Other Syrian troops in the area fired back. The gunbattle sent
panicky residents crowding a nearby cooking gas distribution center
fleeing,'' said a police spokesman, who cannot be identified under
standing rules.
   He said one Hezbollah militiaman was killed in the 10-minute
shootout. One woman, a Hezbollah fighter and three Syrian soldiers
also were wounded, he said.
   Witnesses said the firefight began when the factions quarreled
about who had priority for butane gas refills. The cooking gas has
been in short supply since artillery duels began devastating Beirut
11 weeks ago in battles between Aoun's mainly Christian troops and
an alliance of Syrian troops and Druse militiamen.
   Six civilians were wounded in another clash, police said,
describing a 30-minute firefight with 106mm recoilless guns and
rocket-propelled grenades between Aoun's units and Syrian troops at
a crossing on the Green Line that divides the segregated capital.
   Shells also triggered fires in four cars near the western edge
of the crossing and halted traffic across the divide for two hours,
the police spokesman said.
   Each side accused the other of provoking the clash, which
violates the latest cease-fire called by the Arab League on May 11.
   Thursday's casualties raised the toll to 359 killed and 1,399
wounded since the fighting broke out March 8, two days after Aoun
imposed a blockade of militia-run ports south of Beirut to recoup
lost taxes of $10 million a year.
   Syrian gunners joined militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt
in shelling the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the
capital.
   None of five cease-fires called by the Arab League has held
because the Syrians continued to shell the enclave's coastline to
prevent Aoun receiving supplies by sea.
   Aoun on Thursday reiterated a call for Syria to withdraw its
troops from Lebanon to strip Israel of any pretext for maintaining
control of a six- to 10-mile border strip.
   The Christian leader criticized the United States for not
pressuring Syrian troops to leave.
   Syria first intervened militarily in Lebanon in June 1976 and
now has 40,000 troops there under an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Aoun has declared a ``war of liberation'' to drive Syria out of
Lebanon. Syria says it will pull out only after the Israeli army
withdraws from its self-designated security zone.

   The federal government issued a new AIDS
prevention guide today specifically intended for parents and other
adults to use in counseling young people about the disease.
   ``Too many of our young people are dying from AIDS and unless we
take immediate action the epidemic will continue to spread among
this very vulnerable population,'' said Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan.
   The new guide is packaged in a folder containing a number of
loose pages bundled in three categories _ one aimed directly at
adults emphasizing the importance of young people learning about
AIDS, one with specific information on the disease itself, and the
third with material written for various age levels that parents can
pass on to their children if they desire.
   The publication is being accompanied by radio and television
public service spots encouraging parents to call the National AIDS
Hotline _ 1-800-342-AIDS _ if they wish to have copies mailed to
their homes.
   The prevention guide is the cornerstone of the third year of the
Public Health Service's education campaign entitled ``America
Responds to AIDS.''
   ``I ask the people of America _ parents, guardians and others _
to take one simple, direct action to protect our children's health:
to sit down and tell them how they prevent infection with HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS,'' said Sullivan.
   More than 18,000 of the nearly 95,000 Americans who have been
diagnosed with AIDS were between 20 and 29 years of age when the
diagnosis was made. Because a person can be infected with the HIV
virus as long as 10 years before symptoms of AIDS appear,
scientists believe a significant number of people in that age group
were infected when they were still teen-agers.
   Dr. James Mason, head of the Public Health Service, emphasized
that the new guide is carefully tailored so parents can decide how
to present the subject to their children in a way that takes into
account each family's own values.
   ``Only you can tell your children which behaviors you think are
responsible and proper,'' he said.
   But along with that observation, he urged ``every concerned
adult to order one and use it right away.''
   ``The parent who does not take the time today to teach his child
properly could end up sitting in a hospital room watching that
child die,'' said Mason, former head of the Centers for Disease
Control.
   PHS spokesman Jim Brown said 500,000 copies of the new guide
have been printed in English and 100,000 in Spanish. The television
announcements promoting the guide have been produced in both
English and Spanish.
   The guide was developed by the CDC in consultation with
specialists in education, child development, health care,
biological sciences and communications.
   Before final publication, it was tested with various groups of
parents for readability, usefulness and effectiveness.
   The one-page ``handout'' included in the kit for parents to give
to late elementary- and middle school-aged children focuses largely
on the ways a person cannot get AIDS. But it does state that a
person can become infected ``either by having sexual intercourse
with an infected person or by sharing drug needles or syringes with
an infected person.''
   The handout written for high school students advises ``don't do
drugs of any kind'' and ``delay sexual intercourse.'' It offers
five reasons for delaying sex, including avoiding unwanted
pregnancy.
   But it goes on to say that ``when you decide you are ready to
become sexually active, do so only with one uninfected partner in a
mutually faithful, long-term relationship, such as marriage.''
   It advises to ``avoid sexual intercourse with people who may be
infected with HIV.''
   Finally: ``If you have sexual intercourse outside of a mutually
faithful, long-term relationship with an uninfected partner, use a
condom. But remember that condoms are not foolproof and may break.
However, use a latex condom whenever having any type of sexual
intercourse.''

   Cornell University has suspended the
graduate student accused of writing a software virus last year that
infected thousands of computers hooked up to a national network,
his lawyer said today.
   The New York Times reported today that Robert Tappan Morris, 23,
was told he had violated the school's code of academic integrity.
   His lawyer, Thomas Guidoboni, confirmed today that a letter to
that effect had been sent to his client, but he would not comment
further.
   The virus entered the national computer network known as
Internet in November and rapidly copied itself, ``infecting'' as
many as 6,000 computers at universities, corporations and military
installations.
   The rogue program did not destroy data but forced operators to
shut down many computers while they purged it. Morris' friends have
quoted the first-year graduate student as saying he did not intend
to create such a problem.
   In a letter to Morris dated May 16, the dean of the graduate
school and the university's Academic Integrity Hearing Board said
Morris would be suspended until the 1990 fall semester.
   Dean Alison P. Casarett said that if Morris wanted to reapply,
the decision to readmit him would be made by the graduate school's
computer science faculty.
   Casarett said the decision to suspend Morris was an academic
ruling and not tied to any criminal charges that Morris might face.
   ``Our process was entirely separate from anything legal
authorities might have done,'' she said.
   Morris faces no criminal charges. A federal grand jury earlier
this year forwarded its recommendations to the Justice Department,
but the department has not taken any action.
   A Cornell University commission in April said that Morris'
action was ``a juvenile act that ignored the clear potential
consequences.''

<TEXT>
   Two U.S. Mormon missionaries were shot
and killed in downtown La Paz, and a group that tried to kill
former U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz last summer claimed
responsibility.
   Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, both 20 and both from
Coalville, Utah, were returning home late Wednesday when
unidentified men shot them with machine guns. One of the victims
died immediately, the other died en route to a hospital.
   A radical leftist group, Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front,
claimed responsibility in a written statement distributed to La Paz
newspapers.
   ``The violation of our sovereignty cannot go unpunished,'' the
front said in a statement. ``The Yankee invaders who come to
massacre our fellow farmers, be warned. We the poor have no other
road than to rise up in arms. Our hatred is implacable and our war
is to the death.''
   The missionaries from the Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints lived in a poor neighborhood in La Paz. Police
said they have no suspects in the killings, and no further details
on the shooting were immediately available.
   The Liberation Front was unknown until it claimed responsibility
for an attempt in August to assassinate Shultz, who was in La Paz
for talks with government officials. A bomb exploded near vehicles
carrying him, his wife and members of his delegation. No one was
injured in the attack.
   The U.S. Embassy in La Paz said in a statement today that the
United States ``deplores and condemns the assassination of two
American citizens in an act that can only be described as
cold-blooded murder. No cause, political or otherwise, can justify
a crime of this nature.''
   A spokesman for the Mormon Church in Bolivia said: ``It is a
tragedy that we condemn and feel terrible about.'' The spokesman,
who requested anonymity, said several churches have been damaged by
bomb attacks in recent months.
   In Salt Lake City, church spokesman Don LeFevre said it was the
first time Mormon missionaries have been killed by terrorists. The
6.6 million-member Mormon church has about 35,000 missionaries
worldwide. Under church rules, men serve two-year missions and
women serve for 18 months.
   Ball arrived in La Paz in June and Wilson in July, according to
Steven Wright, president of the church's La Paz mission.

   Two eighth-graders admitted
belonging to a computer hacking network that defrauded more than 20
companies of up to $1.5 million in goods and services, federal
authorities said.
   The computer systems infiltrated include Home Box Office, the
Michigan Treasury Department and RCA Telephone System Sales, the
Secret Service said.
   ``This is the kind of crime we are going to deal with more and
more in the 20th century as we move into a cashless society,''
James Huse, agent in charge of the Secret Service's Detroit office,
said Wednesday.
   In addition to the two 14-year-olds in Sterling Heights, Secret
Service agents questioned five teen-agers in Boston, Atlanta and
Columbus, Ohio, and a woman in Chicago.
   At least 55 other people nationwide used the network's
information, officials said.
   The Michigan teen-agers are too young to face federal charges
but could be charged under state juvenile laws.
   ``They got hooked because of their fascination with the
medium,'' Huse said. ``They gained access to telephone access codes
and financial institutions' access codes which could be used by
them to obtain free phone services and property.''

<HEAD>Cut 100,000 From Force, Defense Minister Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Swiss army's required strength will
be cut by 100,000 men by the mid-1990s, and soldiers' military
service will end at age 42 instead of 50, the defense minister
proposed Thursday.
   The proposals, which need parliamentary approval, would make the
army ``leaner without losing muscle'' and free more people to run
the economy and civilian sectors during a crisis, said Defense
Minister Kaspar Villiger.
   The changes were proposed because of a drop in the number of
available young soldiers and financial pressure on defense spending.
   The plan was unveiled 10 days before an unprecedented popular
proposal to disband the army takes center-stage in Swiss politics.
The Socialist Party, a member of the country's ruling coalition,
will meet to decide its stand on the anti-army referendum, due for
a national vote Nov. 26.
   Launched by socialists and religious groups, the referendum is
opposed by the Socialists' three center-right partners _ potential
trouble for an alliance that has governed since 1959 and often is
cited as a key to Switzerland's political stability.
   The neutral nation's army _ a traditional pillar of society and
highly rated by foreign experts _ would be mobilized from among its
5.4 million citizens. The government lists full mobilization
strength at 740,000.
   The military reform would gradually reduce the army's minimum
target strength to 450,000 by about 1995, from 550,000 today.
   Soldiers would have to continue periodic service after basic
training only until age 42, instead of through age 50. The cutoff
age for officers would be lowered to 50 from 55.

   The chairman of the Interstate Commerce
Commission resigned in tears today, saying ``the White House and I
have concluded it was not in our interest to fight the Senate
Commerce Committee.''
   Heather J. Gradison, a member of the commission since 1982 and
its chairman since December 1985, offered no further explanation at
a meeting attended by about 100 ICC employees. They applauded when
she finished her brief statement.
   Her five-year term was up last December but she has remained on
the job. A source at the ICC who declined to be identified said
Democratic Sens. Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and J. James
Exon of Nebraska have expressed strenuous opposition to her
renomination.
   ``I think it's time to move on,'' said Mrs. Gradison, wife of
Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio.
   Aides said Hollings and Exon were not avbailable for comment
immediately.
   Insiders said the dispute with the Senate Commerce Committee
goes back to last year when a bill to reregulate the railroad
industry was defeated 11-10 in the committee.
   Mrs. Gradison is a strong advocate of deregulation.
   ``We have a different agency today than we had seven years
ago,'' Mrs. Gradison said. ``We have far fewer employees ... we
have a healthy rail industry, we have a competitive motor carrier
industry.''
   The 100-year-old ICC has been a target of budget cutters. Two
years ago, the Senate transportation appropriations subcommittee
slashed the commission's budget so sharply that all employees had
to be put on a four-day work week for four months.
   The ICC source said when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va.,
introduced a bill last year to reregulate the railroad industry,
Exon voted against it and that ``it was understood that the deal
cut by Exon was that the bill would not come up again if new people
came on to the commission.''
   The source said because of the opposition to Mrs. Gradison, the
feeling was that if her name were sent over for renomination by
President Bush there would be a difficult fight and the
reregulation bill would be introduced again.
   ``Rather than having her personality and renomination be the
focus of the move to reregulate the railroads, the White House and
Mrs. Gradison decided it would be best not to get into that
fight,'' the source said.
   Mrs. Gradison said she will stay on until a successor is
confirmed for the job.
   Her voice breaking, Mrs. Gradison said: ``I think the time has
come to take advantage of the free market opportunity I have talked
about and find some for myself.''

<HEAD>Economy Grew at 4.3 Percent Annual Rate in First Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts 2 grafs of Boskin comment after 12th graf, ``Fed policy''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a 4.3 percent annual
rate in the first three months of 1989, much slower than previously
thought, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department's estimate of growth in the gross
national product, the broadest measure of economic health, was well
below an initial estimate a month ago that put the GNP increase at
5.5 percent.
   The slowdown was even more pronounced when the effects of a
rebound from last year's drought in the farm sector were removed.
   That rebound added 2.5 percentage points to growth in the first
quarter after the drought had subtracted 1.1 percentage points in
the last quarter of 1988.
   Thus, growth in the non-farm economy slumped to a lackluster 1.8
percent in the first three months of the year, down from a non-farm
growth rate of 3.5 percent in the fourth quarter and the slowest
quarterly GNP advance in more than two years.
   At the same time, inflation grew at an annual rate of 5 percent
during the January-March quarter, unchanged from the earlier
estimate.
   The 4.3 percent overall GNP increase was substantially lower
than expected. In advance of today's report, many forecasters were
looking for only a slight downward revision to 5.4 percent GNP
growth.
   However, Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm,
said the GNP report was actually good news for the economy because
much of the weakness came from a big downward revision in the
amount of inventories being accumulated by businesses.
   While inventory growth adds to the GNP growth rate, it is often
worrisome to economists who fear that it will lead to big cutbacks
in production in later months as companies try to get their
stockpiles more in line with sales. If the production cutbacks and
job layoffs are too severe, then an unwanted inventory buildup can
trigger a recession.
   ``The fact that inventories were well under control means there
won't be a cutback this quarter,'' Evans said. ``The economy is in
amazingly good shape. There seem to be no signs of a serious
slowdown.''
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the Federal Reserve's
efforts to fight inflation by slowing growth appeared to be having
the desired effects.
   ``Fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding in
steering the economy to a more moderate, but sustainable, growth
path,'' he said in a statement. ``A more moderate pace of economic
growth at this stage of the record expansion will assist in
reducing inflationary pressures in the quarter ahead.''
   At the White House, Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's
Council of Economic Advisers said, ``It's not usual, but it's not
at all uncommon'' to see a revision in the GNP figures as large as
that reported today.
   ``I'm confident the economy will continue growth, inflation will
be contained and the economy will remain solid,'' he told reporters.
   In a separate report, the National Association of Realtors said
existing home sales fell by 1.2 percent in April to an annual rate
of 3.36 million units. It was the fourth consecutive monthly
decline, reflecting the fact that rising mortgage rates are
continuing to take their toll on the housing industry.
   In another report, the National Association of Business
Economists said its latest survey projected that economic growth
will slow dramatically this year but the nation should be able to
forestall a recession until at least 1990.
   The consensus of 54 forecasting experts surveyed by the
association was that unemployment would rise modestly this year
with inflation picking up as well because of higher food and energy
prices.
   The slowdown being forecast by the business economists was
evident in today's GNP report.
   Even with the effects of the drought, the GNP expanded last year
at a four-year high of 3.9 percent. That rapid pace helped to drive
unemployment down sharply and the overall prosperity was credited
in part with helping the Republicans hold onto the White House.
   However, the expansion, which has lasted a peacetime record of
more than six years, is expected to slow this year under the impact
of the credit-tightening engineered by the Federal Reserve in an
effort to keep inflation under control.
   Economists say it is still an open question whether the Fed's
intervention will succeed in achieving slower growth and lower
inflation or a more severe weakening that could topple the country
into a recession.
   A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 5
percent from January through March, reflecting higher wage costs
for federal employees and higher food and energy prices.
   The inflation advance, while unchanged from the initial estimate
a month ago, was up from a 4.2 percent rate of inflation in the
final three months of 1988.
   The sharp downward revision in overall growth reflected in large
part a slower buildup in business inventories than previously
believed. The Commerce Department said part of this reduction in
estimated inventories came from $1 billion lower growth in the
value of unsold autos.
   This development was viewed positively by economists because it
means automakers may not have to cut back production as sharply as
previously believed.
   The lower inventory growth was offset somethat by a
better-than-expected decline in the U.S. trade deficit. As measured
by the GNP, it narrowed at an annual rate of $17.6 billion in the
first quarter, the first quarterly improvement since the spring of
1988. Exports shot up at a 15.3 percent rate, while imports rose a
slight 0.9 percent.
   In other developments, consumer spending rose at a modest 1.1
percent rate in the first three months of the year, down sharply
from a 3.5 percent fourth quarter increase.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of overall
economic activity, is expected to slow sharply this year.
Economists thus are pinning their hopes for avoiding a recession on
continued improvement in the trade deficit and further growth in
business investment.
   Reflecting that scenario, the GNP report showed that capital
spending by businesses jumped 7.6 percent in the first quarter,
rebounding from a 2.9 percent decline in the October-December
fourth quarter.
   Housing construction, which has been hurt by rising mortgage
rates, fell at a rate of 5.4 percent in the first quarter while
government spending grew at a modest rate of 1.4 percent,
reflecting in part efforts to reduce the federal budget deficit.
   In another report today, the Commerce Department said the
after-tax profits of corporations fell by 1.7 percent in the first
quarter of 1989 following a 3.2 percent rise in the fourth quarter.
It was the biggest decline in business profits since a 2.5 percent
drop in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   The GNP, before adjusting for inflation, grew 8.7 percent to
$5.105 trillion from January through March, reflecting the first
quarter the economy has passed the $5 trillion mark.
   In inflation-adjusted dollars, the GNP measured $4.077 trillion.
   The Bush administration is counting on growth to remain at a
fairly robust level in order to reduce the federal budget deficit
below $100 billion next year without resorting to tax increases.
   The Bush budget is built on economic assumptions that the GNP
will grow at a 3.2 percent rate this year, down only slightly from
last year's 3.9 percent increase.
   However, private analysts generally believe that forecast is too
optimistic with many private analysts looking for growth to average
around 2.8 percent for the entire year, more than a full percentage
point lower than the 1988 growth.

   Premier Li Peng today denied that he called
troops into Beijing to crush a pro-democracy student movement.
China's Cabinet ordered local officials to use ``forceful
measures'' to quell the campaign.
   Earlier today, more than 100,000 workers and intellectuals
marched to join students in demanding Li's ouster. An intense power
struggle within the political leadership appeared unresolved.
   Li's statement on state-run television broke a silence that
began Saturday, when he imposed martial law in Beijing.
   He said the army had not yet entered the city because ``our
government is a people's government and our army is a people's
army.''
   Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people built street
barricades to stop the army's advance on students occupying central
Tiananmen Square.
   The television news quoted Li as saying that the thousands of
troops surrounding Beijing would only enter the city once local
citizens understand their purpose.
   He denied claims the army was called in to crush the monthlong
student movement, the largest in communist China's 40 years.
   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman denied today that either
Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang _ who had shown sympathy for the
students' cause _ or Li had lost their posts. She refused to
comment on strife within the leadership.
   In a defeat for Zhao, long a rival of Li, state-run radio
reported that 27 of 29 provinces have backed the martial law order.
   The State Council, China's Cabinet, issued a circular saying
students had forced their way onto trains to Beijing, hindering
efforts to end turmoil in the capital and disrupting railway
operations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The circular said local police and governments should use
``forceful measures'' to stop the students, but it did not explain.
   Today's marchers converged on Tiananmen Square, China's symbolic
center of power, two days after an estimated 1 million people held
a similar protest demanding Li's ouster.
   The banner-waving procession chanted, ``We won't stop until Li
Peng steps down!'' They also demanded the resignation of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, believed to have been behind Li's crackdown.
   ``This is the first time I've demonstrated in my life,'' said
Zhang Ciling, 54, a composer. ``But today I have to express my
feelings. My country is facing a crisis.''
   Some marchers were led by the newly formed Independent Union of
Beijing Intellectuals: teachers, researchers and artists joinging
civil servants from city offices and the ministries of Railways,
Forestry and Foreign Affairs.
   Another procession was led by the Beijing Independent Workers'
Union, a new group challenging government bans on non-official
trade unions.
   ``The movement no longer belongs to the students,'' a machine
factory worker said. ``Intellectuals and workers must unite and
carry it on.''
   The marchers, cheered on by 100,000 onlookers, proceeded around
the square, which has been occupied since May 13 by tens of
thousands of students, who are pressing for reforms including a
free press and an end to official corruption.
   China's leaders were believed to be holding secret meetings to
decide how to cope with the government's worst crisis since the
1966-76 Cultural Revolution.
   Western diplomats said today that Zhao, a relative liberal, had
been strongly criticized in recent meetings of the party's ruling
Politburo and was in danger of being publicly humiliated.
   The diplomats said Li is following the lead of Deng, who had
urged putting Beijing under martial law and having troops crush the
student movement.
   A Foreign Ministry spokeswoman, Li Jinhua, insisted at a weekly
briefing that there had been no leadership changes.
   She said that ``because of the new arrangements of his work''
President Yang Shangkun was postponing a Latin American visit next
week. She refused to answer questions about the Politburo or
whether Zhao was under fire.
   Because of his decision to try to end the upheaval, Premier Li
has been the target of demonstrations that have spread to Shanghai
and dozens of other Chinese cities in the past few days.
   Early today, an effigy of him lying in a tomb was hung in front
of the Great Hall of the People next to Tiananmen Square. Some
passers-by laughed and clapped.
   The military has not tried to push through the barricades set up
by city residents, and some senior officers have called for an end
to martial law.
   But it appeared Wednesday the army was closing ranks behind Li,
with the general staff publishing a letter strongly supporting Li's
hard-line position. The letter was republished today in all major
newspapers.
   However, Chinese sources said the struggle between Zhao and Li
was not yet over. ``The struggle is very intense,'' one source
said. ``We don't even believe our own rumors now.''
   One of the top candidates to move into the void if Zhao and Li
fall, National People's Congress Chairman Wan Li, arrived in
Shanghai late Wednesday after cutting short a visit to the United
States.

   The Soviet Union has retracted a threat to
retain some nuclear missiles banned under a 1987 treaty, U.S.
officials said today.
   The SS-23 missiles, which have a range of about 315 miles, or
just above the treaty threshold, were outlawed along with all U.S.
and Soviet missiles with a range of 312 to 3,125 miles.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said May 13 while
on a trip to West Germany that destruction of the SS-23s might be
stopped if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization deployed new
Lance missiles.
   The U.S.-built Lances have a range of about 75 miles, but after
the treaty was signed the United States and Britain launched a
campaign within NATO to more than triple the missile's range to
just below 300 miles.
   West Germany and several smaller countries in the Western
alliance registered objections to the modernization program and
called for U.S.-Soviet negotiations over the Lances and other
short-range nuclear arms.
   The issue will be aired in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday when
President Bush and the leaders of the 15 other NATO countries hold
a summit meeting in the Belgian capital.
   Shevardnadze's statement was interpreted as an attempt to
pressure the allies to postpone plans for making the Lance missiles
more potent. The United States and Britain also are resisting West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's call for negotiations as
potentially harmful to NATO's strategy.
   The State Department on May 15 denounced Shevardnadze's
statement as ``outlandish'' and Bush last Sunday said the threat
made ``clear that Soviet `new thinking' has not yet totally
overcome the old.''
   However, the day before Bush spoke Pravda, the Soviet Communist
party newspaper, had published an interview with Shevardnadze in
which he said ``no one in the U.S.S.R. intends to upset the INF
(Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) treaty.''
   On Monday, the Soviet foreign ministry spokesman, Gennady
Gerasimov, gave similar assurances in Moscow.
   The Soviets ``called our attention'' to the retractions, a U.S.
official said today. The official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said it had been considered unlikely in any event that
the Soviets would not fulfill their obligation under the treaty to
destroy the missiles.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler today welcomed
Shevardnadze's statement and said Gerasimov's remarks had also been
noted.
   During negotiations that preceded the 1987 treaty the Soviets
resisted including the SS-23s, but relented. They have 200 missiles
in the category as well as trainers. All are supposed to be
destroyed by Dec. 1.

<HEAD>Energy Official Says Soviets Selling More Nuclear Fuel To U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is increasing its sales of
enriched uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants and is ``not playing
fairly'' in the global market for this product, a senior Energy
Department official said Thursday.
   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, said the Soviets now
have 8 percent of the U.S. market for enriched uranium, which is
used as a fuel for civilian nuclear power plants.
   ``There are plans for them to move even more aggressively to
take even more of our market right out from under our noses,''
Moore told a Capitol news conference at which House members
unveiled a bill aimed at revitalizing U.S. sales of enriched
uranium.
   Moore did not elaborate on his assertion that the Soviets were
``unfairly'' marketing their uranium enrichment services, except to
say it was difficult to determine their production costs because of
the closed nature of that society.
   Moore said the Bush administration had helped draft the House
bill, which would tranform the Energy Department's enriched uranium
operations into a government corporation. The United States has no
privately run uranium enrichment business.
   Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., a lead sponsor of the bill, said
the U.S. share of the world market for sales of enriched uranium
has plunged from 100 percent 15 years ago to less than 50 percent
today. She said the decline would continue unless the operation
were made a government corporation.
   Rep. Bob McEwen, R-Ohio, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said
taking the Energy Department out of the business would give it more
flexibility, since its executives would not have to get
congressional approval before making key moves.
   The department runs its enrichment operations at plants in
Portsmouth, Ohio, and Paducah, Ky. These plants increase, or
``enrich,'' uranium-235 atoms beyond their natural concentration
for use in nuclear reactors, including those used to power Navy
ships and submarines.

<HEAD>Farmers May Face Taxes On Forgiven Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service says farmers may
be liable for capital-gains taxes if part of a Farmers Home
Administration loan is forgiven.
   The ruling, which was made public in a letter to members of
Congress, is in line with the law affecting other taxpayers, which
holds generally that forgiveness of a debt creates taxable income.
   ``We are disappointed, but it's not something that was totally
unexpected,'' Jim Sinner, an aide to Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
said Thursday. ``What the IRS is saying basically is that where
there is forgiveness of debt, there is going to be an income tax
consequence.''
   The IRS letter resulted from a Farmers Home Administration query
asking hypothetically how a restructuring of an FmHA loan would be
treated for tax purposes.
   ``The one outstanding issue that was resolved in this IRS
explanation is treatment of `shared-appreciation agreements' and
other contractual arrangements that continue beyond the act of
restructuring,'' Sinner said.
   Under shared appreciation, a farmer agrees that as a condition
of having a loan restructured, any increase in value of the
property securing the loan over the next 10 years will be shared
with the government.
   Under the ruling, Sinner said, current taxes would not be
affected by such an agreement. But once the property increases in
value and the sharing arrangement is triggered, there would be a
new calculation that takes into account the higher value.
   Sinner said Dorgan will introduce a bill that would forgive
taxes due on restructured loans in cases in which the farmer is
operating on a margin so thin that he cannot afford the taxes.

<HEAD>Congress Urged to Open the Way for Quicker Refunds</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Regulators and consumer advocates urged
Congress Thursday to open the way for quicker refunds to customers
of more than $19 billion in excess taxes collected by utilities.
   ``The plain, unvarnished fact is that investor-owned utilities
have collected from ratepayers _ and are using for their own
purposes _ $19 billion more (about $223 per household) than they
owe the U.S. government for income taxes,'' Susan C. Stone, a
member of the Illinois Commerce Commission, told a news conference.
   The taxes were collected in advance from customers in
anticipation that the utilities would have to pay federal taxes at
a maximum corporate rate of 46 percent. However, that rate was
reduced to 34 percent in 1986, and power companies and other
utilities were allowed to keep the excess taxes for as long as 30
years before refunding them.
   A bill introduced by Reps. Bob Matsui, D-Calif., and Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D., would authorize state utility commissioners to
require that the taxes be refunded to customers over a period of at
least three years, starting in 1991.
   ``Never before in my 11 years in Congress has an issue been as
crystal clear as this one,'' Matsui said. ``It's a matter of right
vs. wrong, good public policy vs. bad special interests, ethics vs.
greed.''
   Utilities insist they need to retain the taxes for much longer
to finance improvement of plant and equipment.
   ``This money is not just sitting in a bank account,'' said Bill
McCloskey, spokesman for BellSouth. ``It is being used to improve
the telephone network for the benefit of our customers, which is
the exact intention of the tax code.''
   David M. Barasch, president of the National Association of State
Utility Consumer Advocates, said there is no disagreement that
utilities will never have to pay the excess taxes over to the
government. The only issue, he said, is how soon the money should
be returned to taxpayers.
   ``The timing of refunds is a consumer protection and utility
health issue that is within the expertise of regulators, rather
than tax collectors,'' said Peter Bradford, chairman of the New
York State Public Service Commission. The bill, he added,
``corrects this glaring flaw by providing a minimum refund period
that is more in line with economic reality.''

<TEXT>
   A young Korean conductor was named today as music
director at the new Opera-Bastille, ending months of public
speculation.
   Myung-Whun Chung, 36, who has studied and performed in the
United States, fills the vacancy left in January when Paris Opera
Chairman Pierre Berge fired Israeli conductor Daniel Barenboim,
accusing him of elitist ideas on opera and saying his salary was
too high.
   ``I have preferred to bet on youth and audacity,'' Berge, the
head of the Yves Saint Laurent fashion empire, told reporters. ``He
is a man of talent, integrity, ambition and enthusiasm.'' He
declined to disclose Chung's salary.
   Chung was on hand for the announcement which was made during a
heated news conference held in the Opera-Bastille's brand new
amphitheater, a sleek design in glass and marbled polished granite.
   Berge and Chung were pressed for details on their plans for
performances but said they could not yet provide them. The schedule
for the new Opera has been the subject of intense public disputes
for years.
   ``If there is a fight, and I'll say it publicly right now, I
won't fight, I'll just leave,'' the soft-spoken Chung said in
English, translated into French for reporters.
   ``I have one request _ that we work together for the benefit of
the Opera Bastille as a unified team and do not let other people
throw us off,'' he said.
   Berge was appointed by President Francois Mitterrand to
supervise the final days of the Opera-Bastille project during the
countdown to its inauguration on July 13. The gala concert, to be
performed before Mitterrand, President Bush and a host of other
VIPs, is to be one of the centerpieces of official celebrations of
the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution.
   It will feature a series of classical arias from famous French
operas sung by a cast of international singers and staged by
American Bob Wilson, the longtime darling of the French avant-garde.
   Chung was born in Seoul, South Korea, on Jan. 22, 1953, and
moved with his family to the United States in 1971 so that he and
his gifted sisters could pursue their music studies. His younger
sister is the well-known violinist Kyung-Wha Chung and his older
sister is the cellist Myung-Wha Chung.
   He studied piano and conducting at the Mannes School of Music in
New York and in 1974, won second prize in the Tchaikovsky Piano
Competition in Moscow.
   He entered the Juilliard School of Music the following year as a
conducting student. In 1978 he became assistant to Carlo Maria
Giulini and associate conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
   He is the principal guest conductor at the Teatro Communale and
Maggio Musicale festival in Florence, Italy, where he is conducting
Mozart's ``Idomeneo.''
   Although Chung is known as a serious and gifted musician, his
selection came as a surprise because of his limited experience in
conducting opera.

   Two Vietnam veterans from Akron, Ohio, said
Thursday they will continue to organize group tours of Vietnam for
fellow veterans, in defiance of a Treasury Department order.
   The American Civil Liberties Union said it will defend the two
men if they are prosecuted.
   The Treasury Department sent a letter in February to Donald
Mills and John Myers, of the Akron chapter of Vietnam Veterans of
America, them to ``immediately terminate performing any activities
involving travel tours to Vietnam.''
   The department's letter said such activities are prohibited
under foreign assets control regulations and are punishable by a
fine of up to $50,000, imprisonment for up to 10 years, or both.
   The regulations were issued in March, 1988, in accordance with
economic embargo laws affecting Vietnam, Cambodia and North Korea
under the Trading with the Enemy act. They do not prevent a veteran
from traveling on his or her own.
   Mills and Myers have conducted the trips twice yearly since
1984. The seventh and most recent one was in February.
   The next trip is scheduled for November and will involve 21 or
22 veterans, paying $2,700 for three weeks in Vietnam including
travel, accomodations and meals, Mills said.
   He said it would be too difficult and costly for most veterans
to make the trip individually.
   Mills said he began the trips after going to Vietnam on a
permitted mission for the veterans' organization in 1984, and
finding that many veterans wanted to return to the scene of the war.
   ``I feel that going back to Vietnam is very beneficial to
them,'' he said. ``Every other veteran in history has been able to
return back to the battlefield that they served in. There is no
reason why we as veterans can't do the same thing.''
   Susan R. Brenda, legislative analyst with the Washington office
of the ACLU, joined Mills and Myers at a news conference and said,
``The Treasury Department is simply without authority to reach
directly into the First Amendment-protected activities of Americans
in the United States and prevent them from organizating towards the
perfectly legal end of travel to Vietnam.''
   In 1977, the Treasury Department issued regulations exempting
travel transactions from the embargo, and authorizing individuals
to spend funds incident to travel. The March, 1988, regulation
amended this by prohibiting Americans in the United States from
arranging or promoting such travel.
   ``We believe that an attempt to prosecute Vietnam veterans for
traveling back to Vietnam in an effort to learn about present day
Vietnam and heal old, deep wounds would be a grave mistake,'' Ms.
Brenda said. ``Should the government proceed along that course,
however, we will assist these veterans in their legal defense.''
   A telephone call was placed to Roger Bolton, assistant secretary
of the treasury for public affairs, for comment, but he was not
immediately available.
   Ms. Brenda said the ACLU is supporting a bill sponsored by Rep.
Howard Berman, D-Calif., that would prohibit the embargo laws from
being used to limit the travel of Americans abroad.

<HEAD>Wages of Major Japanese Firms Rise 5.11 Percent in 1989</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The average wage at 317 major Japanese companies
rose by 5.11 percent this year, compared with last year's 4.39
percent raise, the Japan Federation of Employees' Association said
Thursday.
   An association official attributed the bigger raises to a
domestic business boom.
   In April, labor unions demanded shorter working hours as well as
higher wages, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said 28.6 percent of the 317 companies agreed to shorten
working hours.
   According to Labor Ministry figures, Japanese workers took only
7.6 days of the 15.1 days of vacation to which they were entitled
in 1987. The government seeks to reduce average annual working
hours from 2,111 in 1988 to 1,800 by 1993.
   Workers are seeking to live more comfortably by working less and
gaining higher purchasing power with price stabilization, since
their monthly pay is nearly the highest in the world, the official
said.
   Management tries to hold down monthly wages while paying higher
bonuses _ twice a year _ if a company earns high profits, the
official said.
   Before the wage increase in April, the average monthly wage at
the 317 companies was $1,715, not including bonuses and overtime,
the official said.
   Those companies employ 2.43 million workers, or 5.4 percent of
Japan's 45 million-member labor force, the official said.
   The Institution of Labor Administration, a private research
center, said workers at 263 major firms will receive bonuses
averaging $4,400 this summer, up 7.7 percent from a year ago and
the highest in nine years.

   Soldiers today shot and killed a Palestinian in
the occupied Gaza Strip, and Arab reports said 17 other
Palestinians were injured in stone-throwing protests in the
occupied territories.
   The killing raised to 498 the number of Palestinians killed in
the anti-Israeli uprising.
   Five soldiers were wounded in the clashes, Israel radio reported.
   Also today, a military judge acquitted four soldiers of
manslaughter and an army doctor of negligence in the beating death
of a Palestinian man last summer. The four soldiers were convicted
of a lesser charge of mistreating the detainee.
   The focus of today's violence was the Jabaliya refugee camp, a
shantytown housing 53,000 refugees in the north of the Gaza Strip.
   U.N. relief officials and Arab hospitals initially reported
three deaths, but later said only one youth, identified as
18-year-old Khaled Mohammed Atawneh, died in the camp of a fatal
gunshot wound to the head.
   The army confirmed the death and said another Palestinian was
critically injured in Jabaliya.
   A U.N. relief official reached by telephone in nearby Gaza City
said there were ``ongoing incidents'' in the camp, although
soldiers had imposed a curfew.
   Nine youths were also reported wounded in the legs in Jabaliya.
   Another eight Palestinians suffered slight to moderate wounds in
clashes that broke out in four other places, including Gaza City's
Sabra quarter and the Shati and Bureij refugee camps.
   Five Israeli soldiers were treated for injuries from rocks and
bricks thrown at them in Jabaliya, Israel radio said.
   Speaking to Israeli reporters in the Gaza Strip, Justice
Minister Dan Meridor defended the army's tough response to the
protests saying, ``The Arabs must understand there will be no
chances for a peace process without the army's determination to put
down violence.''
   In Spain, Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir challenged Arab leaders
to sit down with Israelis to discuss an end to the ``state of war''
in the Middle East.
   The Israeli leader was in Spain on a two-day official visit
seeking support for his plan to hold elections among the 1.7
million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Palestinians object to the proposal because it does not
guarantee them independence or an end to Israeli military rule.

   A dispute over short-range nuclear
weapons policy may not be resolved before President Bush and the
other NATO leaders begin a summit next week, the alliance's chief
executive said Thursday.
   ``I've still some hope, but I'm not sure,'' Secretary-General
Manfred Woerner said in an interview at North Atlantic Treaty
Organization headquarters.
   Failure to settle the disagreement, which is primarily between
the United States and Germany, would be ``a rather unfortunate
situation, but it would not be a crisis or a catastrophe,'' he said.
   ``This alliance has lived with differences of opinion all
through its very successful lifetime, and if this question is not
solved today it will be solved tomorrow,'' the former West German
defense minister declared.
   Woerner added, however, that he would like the allies to
overcome their divisions ``and avoid the impression of being split
in an important matter.''
   Bush and leaders of the 15 other members will meet on Monday and
Tuesday for a 40th anniversary summit. It will be the first NATO
meeting for the president since his inauguration in January.
   NATO officials had hoped the meeting would be an example of
unity at a time when Mikhail S. Gorbachev's promises of reductions
in the Soviet military personel, arms and defense spending have
captured public imagination in Western Europe.
   The argument over short-range, or battlefield, nuclear weapons
has dominated preparations for the meeting, at which the leaders
are expected to plot NATO strategy.
   At issue is a West German demand for early negotiations with the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact on reducing such arms in Europe. Most of
NATO's short-range nuclear missiles are based in West Germany and
would be used there in case of war.
   The United States and Britain arguing that attention should
center on new talks in Vienna on reducing conventional weapons.
They also feel negotiations on tactical nuclear arms would lead
inevitably to removal of all such weapons from Europe.
   Woerner said any solution to the dispute must connect the
beginning of short-range nuclear negotiations to a specific stage
of the conventional arms discussions.
   As examples, he mentioned the end of the first phase, during
which bargaining positions are introduced, and when results of the
talks are implemented.
   Alliance officials have been seeking acceptable language on the
future role of short-range nuclear weapons for the Comprehensive
Concept, a blueprint for NATO planning on arms control and force
structures. The document is virtually complete except for a
paragraph on the contentious issue.
   Some diplomats have said they would like the document released,
probably Monday, even if teh dispute is not settled. Woerner would
not speculate on whether that would be done.
   He also said the summit's main task will be to map the future
NATO agenda, including a ``political message'' on relations with
the changing Soviet bloc.
   Bush and the others will consider ``how we want to cooperate
with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe (and) make use of the
existing opportunities,'' Woerner said. ``Let me make it very clear
that this summit is not a missile summit.''

   Georgy Tovstonogov, one of the Soviet Union's
best-known producers who created ``a golden age of theater'' on the
Leningrad stage where he worked for more than 30 years, has died at
the age of 75.
   ``Many believe that Soviet culture has suffered an irretrievable
loss,'' Tass said Thursday in announcing the death of the chief
producer at the Leningrad Gorky Academic Bolshoi Drama Theater.
   It did not give the cause of death, but Leningrad TV news said
he died in a car accident.
   Tovstonogov, a native of Tbilisi, the capital of Soviet Georgia,
was named chief producer at the theater in 1956.
   ``At the Leningrad Academic Theater, Tovstonogov staged
productions which created a golden age of theater,'' Tass said.
   Among his most famed productions was a stage adaptation of
Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel ``The Idiot.'' He also wrote books on
stage technique and theory.
   Tovstonogov's official death notice was signed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other Communist Party and government
leaders, a tribute to Tovstonogov's prominence.
   He also served for many years as a member of the Supreme Soviet
legislature and as secretary of the governing board of the
theaterworkers union, Tass said.

<HEAD>Tentative Settlement in 11-Day Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Teachers today tentatively agreed to end a
strike that has crippled the nation's second-largest school
district for 11 days.
   A 10-hour bargaining session ended about 1 a.m. with an
agreement on a three-year package that would give teachers an 8
percent raise per year and more say in shaping the curriculum in
the 594,000-student district.
   Teachers could be back in class by Friday if they approve the
pact, said union president Wayne Johnson. A ratification vote was
set for this afternoon.
   The union board of directors met to consider the agreement this
afternoon as ballots and copies of the offer were printed up for
the ratification vote.
   The union representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers
walked out May 15 in the city's first such strike in 19 years.
   About half the students stayed away from school, opting for the
beach, shopping malls or home. Many who did attend school were
treated to games, cartoons and filmstrips because there weren't
enough substitute teachers.
   Teachers had been earning between $23,440 and $43,319 a year,
depending on experience and education. The new pact would raise
those salaries in the first year of the contract to $25,316 and
$46,594.
   At the start of the walkout, the district was offering a 21.5
percent raise over three years; the union had sought a two-year, 21
percent increase.
   The contract would also give teachers a bigger hand in deciding
what goes on in their classrooms, with the district no longer
enjoying veto power on curriculum decisions.
   ``I hope this signals a new era of working together, of
cooperation, rather than confrontation,'' said school board
President Roberta Weintraub.
   But Johnson said the union made compromises that could become
stumbling blocks, including an agreement that teachers would work
extra hours to recover pay docked during the dispute. He would not
say whether he would recommend ratification.
   Johnson said the strike probably would leave no hard feelings
between the union and district but that it would take a
``considerable amount of time to heal those wounds'' between
striking teachers and those who crossed picket lines.
   On Wednesday, a striking teacher was booked on assault charges
for allegedly throwing a rock at a substitute. Sheriff's deputies
said the rock missed the teacher's car and struck a 12-year-old
girl outside a junior high school.
   Negotiations had collapsed Sunday with both sides accusing each
other of lying and bargaining in bad faith.
   But Johnson said the impasse was broken following meetings
Tuesday in Sacramento in which officials from both sides spoke to
Los Angeles-area lawmakers. The meetings laid groundwork for
Wednesday's negotiating session.
   Most classes wind up June 23, but some schools operate
year-round.

   The cost of being represented in court

snakes.
   Robert Haggerty, who breeds snakes for a living, told Cass
Circuit Court Judge Donald Leicht that he could not afford an

   So Leicht reviewed Haggerty's assets this week and ordered his
stock of snakes sold at auction to pay legal costs.
   Haggerty, 36, estimated the value of his pets at $3,800, said
court reporter Debbie Frey.
   The snakes were taken from Haggerty's apartment April 18 after
police arrested him on charges of possession of cocaine and
marijuana.
   Authorities had been called to the apartment by a neighbor
complaining of a burning smell. The odor turned out to be caused by
a makeshift electrical system through which Haggerty allegedly was
using the neighbor's electricity, investigators said.
   When authorities entered the apartment, they saw a sign on a
bedroom door that read: ``Don't enter this room. A rattlesnake is
out of the cage.''
   The officers called in animal control officer Dan Baker.
   ``There was no power in the house,'' said Baker, ``and I'm
walking around with a flashlight trying to find a snake.''
   They found 18 reptiles, all in aquariums. One other aquarium
housed 23 live mice _ the snakes' intended meals.
   The snakes included three poisonous rattlesnakes, an Arizona
mountain king, an albino black rattler and three boa constrictors.
One of the boas is pregnant and could give birth to about 50
offspring, each worth $80 to $100, Baker said.
   Authorities have been calling zoos around the Midwest but have
yet to receive an offer for the snakes.

   Chinese students at U.S. universities
are setting up news hot lines and raising thousands of dollars to
provide communications equipment for the protesting students in
Beijing.
   The $27,000 raised so far by students in the Boston area
includes $15,000 from a fund-raiser Tuesday night. The money for
such equipment as fax machines and copiers and material will have
to be taken clandestinely into China by students returning home or
by other friends of the movement, organizers said Wednesday.
   Dubbed the ``May 4th Foundation,'' after one of China's first
pro-democracy student uprisings in 1919, the fund has drawn chiefly
from the roughly 600 Chinese students studying in the Boston area.
It has also attracted contributions from students from Hong Kong
and Taiwan as well as a few from Americans.
   The demonstration that has dominated Beijing and other Chinese
cities for weeks ``will be remembered probably as the greatest
popular movement in China,'' said Pei Minxin, 31, a third-year
graduate student in government at Harvard.
   ``It has accomplished a great deal so far. It has aroused the
political consciousness of the Chinese people and also provided the
Chinese people both at home and abroad with a sense of hope,'' he
said.
   In addition to raising money, Chinese students in the Boston
area have set up an informal information center.
   The Walker Center for Ecumenical Exchange, an international
study center in Newton, Mass., has donated its phones to Chinese
students who man them in 24-hour shifts, monitoring news reports,
receiving information from China, and passing on news not available
on the streets of Beijing.
   Wednesday was the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's turn
to man the phones. Chinese students from Harvard, Boston
University, Northeastern, Brandeis and Tufts University also have
participated.
   Center Director Gordon Schultz said he is ``terrified'' of the
phone bill he will receive, but hopes to raise funds from Americans
to support the effort.
   The center also is providing computers and fax machines for the
students.
   At the University of California at Berkeley and Stanford
University, students are compiling news reports and using fax
machines to transmit the information back to China under the name
``operation newslift.''
   Li Hao, 24, a student at MIT, said the fund-raising effort is
designed to sustain the demonstration. But he said the protest
movement has already achieved its primary goal.
   ``China is no longer what it was before,'' Hao said. ``The
Chinese government can no longer do whatever they want.''
   The students studying here say they wish they could participate
in the China demonstrations and are acting to contribute something.
But they are anxious for their friends.
   ``Most of my classmates are in Tiananmen Square, so I'm
concerned very much,'' said Hao, a graduate of Beijing University.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The West German dispute with the Bush
administration over short-range nuclear weapons has ended decades
of German acquiescence over NATO strategic policy and severely
strained relations with the United States.
   The West German call for prompt superpower talks on the missiles
came just weeks before the upcoming North Atlantic Treaty
Organization summit in Brussels. NATO officials had hoped the May
29-30 meeting would be a show of unity as the alliance celebrates
its 40th anniversary.
   But the unprecedented West German drive for the talks put NATO
on notice that this front-line nation intends to take a greater
role in determining future alliance policy.
   Several European NATO allies expressed support for the West
German position on the talks, deepening the rift.
   ``The age of West German timidity is ending,'' Peter Danylow, a
domestic and foreign policy expert with the Bonn-based Foreign
Affairs Institute, told The Associated Press.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is also resisting
a joint U.S.-British effort to replace NATO's aging short-range
missile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets of more than
triple the current range.
   The issue is sensitive because most of the weapons are deployed
in West Germany and would fall on German soil in the event of war.
   The United States and Britain oppose early talks on the weapons,
saying the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional forces must
first be reduced.
   Kohl, and his foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, maintain
that their nation's legitimate interests must be taken seriously.
   Genscher, architect of the current West German missile policy,
has long advocated that the West take every opportunity to improve
relations with the Soviet bloc.
   But West German resolve on the missile matter is new.
   ``The current missile dispute has made it clear that West
Germany must be seriously reckoned with on alliance decisions that
directly affect German interests,'' said Heinz Timmermann, a
researcher at the Cologne-based Institute for Eastern European and
International Studies.
   Timmermann said Bush administration sluggishness in formulating
a foreign policy response to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's disarmament initiatives fueled Bonn's decision to press
for the talks.
   ``I think many in the government perceived that Washington was
not moving quickly enough and letting Moscow steal the tune,''
Timmermann told the AP.
   The recent West German decision to press for talks on the
weapons came while the popularity of Kohl's coalition government
was at an all-time low, with West Germans becoming increasingly
impatient for the West to respond to Gorbachev's initiatives.
   ``The political pressure to take the missile stand at the time
was certainly enormous,'' Timmermann said.
   After Kohl's Christian Democrats were buffeted by serious
regional election setbacks, the chancellor reshuffled his cabinet
and engineered a coalition consensus on the rockets issue in line
with the growing public mood for progress in arms control efforts.
   Public opinion polls indicate Bonn's current course is supported
by the majority of West Germans, who have become increasingly
defiant about heavy defense burdens put on the country by the
alliance.
   Michael Stuermer, a former Kohl speechwriter and historian now
with the Foundation for Political Science in Ebenhausen, said a
1987 superpower agreement to eliminate intermediate-range nuclear
missiles fueled public demands for new disarmament initiatives.
   ``The chain of arms escalation was broken,'' Stuermer said,
referring to the treaty.
   ``The new dynamic in East-West relations has triggered an urgent
domestic policy issue at home,'' Stuermer said.
   Shortly before the start of the summit, West Germany, Britain
and the United States were still divided over the most contentious
issue, when to start East-West talks on reducing the short-range
missiles.
   In Washington on Thursday, State Department spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said: ``Discussions are continuing. There remains a gap to
be bridged.'' She added that ``we have received a response today
(from West Germany) and the gap remains.''
   Earlier, in an editorial, the respected Die Zeit weekly
newspaper, had admonished the West German government not to back
down too soon.
   ``Better an anniversary fight than a weak compromise,'' said the
independent Die Zeit.

   Navajo police in riot gear and gas
masks removed dozens of supporters of suspended tribal Chairman
Peter MacDonald from an administration building they had occupied
for three days.
   Six people, including MacDonald's sister and three Tribal
Council members, were arrested when about 40 officers stormed the
building held by some 60 MacDonald supporters. The six were
released on their own recognizance this morning.
   MacDonald called Wednesday's arrests ``a disgrace to the Navajo
Nation.''
   ``This whole thing is a silly game. It's an embarrassment to the
chairman and the Navajo Nation,'' said Duane Beyal, a spokesman for
interim Chairman Leonard Haskie.
   Two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries, Beyal
said. One person was hit by a passing car and was held for
observation at a hospital.
   Those arrested were booked on various counts, including
resisting arrest, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct,
according to police.
   Haskie was named interim chairman by the Tribal Council after it
placed MacDonald on leave in February. That followed allegations
before a U.S. Senate committee that MacDonald had taken kickbacks
from contractors.
   MacDonald had denied any wrongdoing and contests the legality of
the council's actions, but tribal courts have upheld his suspension.

<HEAD>Constable Wants Raise From $40 Per Month to $30,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAXAHACHIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Constable Gary Witherspoon wants Ellis
County to pay him $30,000 per year to do what he now does for $40
per month.
   County officials claim Witherspoon and Constable Bruce
Hollabaugh have virtually no duties.
   Witherspoon and Hollabaugh have sued, accusing county
commissioners of acting arbitrarily and unjustly by paying them
only $25 a month plus a $15 monthly car allowance. They want to be
paid what constables in comparable counties earn, as much as
$30,000.
   County Judge Penelope Redington says the county does not give
the constables so much as a pencil or a desk, let alone a car, a
staff and the other usual trappings that would indicate they carry
out official county business.
   State law requires each county with more than 30,000 people to
have at least four justice of the peace precincts, each with a
constable and a justice. Ellis County's population is estimated at
75,000.
   A constable, like a sheriff, is an elected official and a
certified peace officer authorized to carry a gun, make arrests and
serve court-related documents.
   In urban counties, constables usually serve notices of lawsuits
and other papers associated with the civil court system. They also
serve as bailiffs in the justice of the peace courts while the
sheriff runs the jail and carries out law enforcement functions.
   Each of Dallas County's eight constables is paid $49,152
annually plus a monthly car allowance of $350.
   But in rural counties, the sheriff is responsible for all jail
and court-related activities, and the constable's office is largely
symbolic.
   Ellis County Sheriff John Gage, who took office in January and
is paid $34,140 annually, said his deputies serve virtually all
warrants and civil court papers.
   Witherspoon said he also serves civil court papers, mostly those
coming from other counties. He declined to say how many papers he
serves monthly.
   A hearing is set for June 5 on Hollabaugh's suit; no date has
been set for Witherspoon's suit.

<TEXT>
   Relatives of people killed in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Scotland have agreed to allow
filming of a television movie about how they've coped in the
aftermath of the terrorist attack.
   About 75 people, members of a relatives' group called Victims of
Pan Am Flight 103, voted unanimously last weekend to negotiate a
movie deal with Rainy Day Pictures.
   Peter Tsairis said some relatives reacted negatively at first,
but that they now believe a television movie could spur public
opinion toward changes in airline security regulations. The
survivors have been lobbying for stronger passenger safety measures
since the bombing.
   Rainy Day, a Los Angeles company, has produced one short drama,
called ``Lovestruck,'' which was nominated for an Academy Award in
1986, said Fredda Weiss, vice president of the company.
   Weiss said she conceived the idea for the Flight 103 movie after
meeting Tsairis, whose daughter Alexis was one of 35 Syracuse
University students killed in the bombing. A total of 270 people
were killed, including 11 on the ground in Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Weiss said the movie will deal only with events after the
bombing. She said she hopes to buy the story rights of about 25
relatives. Tsairis said all the victims' families will be offered
contracts and that money paid directly to the organization will go
to its lobbying efforts.

   Reijo Kela awakens, performs his
morning hygiene rituals, eats breakfast and dresses in a black suit
and bow tie.
   Sounds normal enough, but Kela is doing it all in a glass box in
a public square downtown, in front of hundreds of curious
pedestrians.
   Kela, a famous Finnish dancer and performance artist, is
performing a week-long modern dance called ``Cityman.''
   Since May 19, Kela has danced, slept, ate, bathed in a
see-through bathtub, and gone to the toilet in his 5-yard-square
booth.
   Kela made no announcement before turning himself into a human
goldfish, and no one is quite sure what he's doing there. He has a
telephone, which he refuses to answer. He reportedly plans to
emerge Friday.
   Music from commercial radio stations blares through a speaker,
interrupted occasionally by recordings of Kela announcing that he
is ``the Cityman. The best. Everybody wants to make love to me.''
   The booth, which has glass on two sides and two boarded walls,
is equipped with a mattress, sleeping bag, two laundry baskets, a
stereo and a red rose beside his bed.
   Occasionally, Kela is joined by one of the seven women who
belong to his dance troupe.
   In his recorded message he promises to ``win over every single
woman who passes by.''
   Pedestrians often walk by quickly with a bemused comment or an
embarrassed smile. ``This must be the answer to the housing
problem,'' one Finn was heard telling his wife.
   Kela also has fans. Some have drawn hearts in lipstick and
written his name on the glass wall, and others have left flowers.
   Not everyone is amused. A TV crew left angrily after hours of
waiting to shoot while Kela, stretched out on a bear rug in midday,
refused to move.
   One young girl complained: ``I've come a long way to see him
because I've liked his dances _ but he hasn't budged.''

<HEAD>New AIDS Brochure Urges More Explicit Family Talks About Sex</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government launched a campaign Thursday to
encourage parents to talk more explicitly with their children about
sex, saying their failure to do so has contributed to the AIDS
epidemic.
   ``The parent who does not take time today to teach his or her
child properly could end up later in a hospital room watching that
child die,'' said Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary of Health
and Human Services.
   Mason unveiled a $1.5 million campaign, involving a new brochure
and television advertisements, designed to spur family dialogues
about sex and AIDS.
   He said the program is taking a somewhat different tack,
stressing the advantages of sexual abstinence by youth, than
earlier AIDS-prevention campaigns, which put more emphasis on the
use of condoms as a ``safe sex'' option.
   ``Kids and condoms don't work awfully well,'' said Mason.
``We've done studies and we find that they act on impulse, they
don't plan ahead so a condom is there.''
   ``I think the fact that parents have not sat down and talked
with their children is the reason that we're today reaping the
harvest of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS),''
said Mason. ``We're trying to bring the nation's parents into this
picture, and let them make the contribution that they are capable
of making.''
   Mason also blamed the lack of frank parental guidance for
contributing to other sexually transmitted diseases, and the 1
million teenage pregnancies annually.
   AIDS is an incurable disease that already has been diagnosed in
almost 95,000 Americans and caused more than 53,000 deaths.
Officials say that about 18,000 of the current cases involve people
aged 19 to 29 years. Since a person may be infected with HIV for up
to 10 years before AIDS symptoms appear, HHS scientists believe
many of the current cases result from teen-age infections.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan and Walter
R. Dowdle, acting director for the Centers for Disease Control,
concurred with Mason at the news conference that parental guidance
is essential if the epidemic is to be brought under control.
   ``Adults have to send a clear message to the young people they
care about,'' said Sullvan. ``No matter how young you are, you can
become infected with HIV if you have sex with an infected person.''
   The officials showed a series of short television commericials
that will be offered to the TV networks as public service
announcements. The ads themselves encourage parents to initiate
frank discussions with their children about AIDS, and give a
toll-free telephone number _ 1-800-342-AIDS _ that adults can call
to obtain copies of the more detailed brochure.
   The campaign calls for sexual abstinence by youth, monogamy for
adults, and the use of condoms for those who insist on having
multiple partners.
   The new guide includes special sections written for children of
various age levels. The Public Health Service is printing 500,000
copies in English and another 100,000 in Spanish. The television
ads are being produced in both languages.
   The guide's section for high school students advises ``don't do
drugs of any kind'' and offers five reasons for delaying sex,
including avoiding unwanted pregnancy.
   The guide for teens, however, goes on to say that ``when you
decide you are ready to become sexually active, do so only with one
uninfected partner in a mutually faithful, long-term relationship,
such as marriage.''
   Finally: ``If you have sexual intercourse outside of a mutually
faithful, long-term relationship with an uninfected partner, use a
condom. But remember that condoms are not foolproof and may break.
However, use a latex condom whenever having any type of sexual
intercourse.''

<HEAD>Economists See ``Soft Landing,'' Inflation Relief Ahead</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top business economists predicted on Thursday
that the U.S. economy is headed for a ``soft landing'' in which
growth slows enough to tame inflation and interest rates without
toppling the country into a recession this year.
   The latest survey from the National Association of Business
Economists projects that the gross national product, the broadest
measure of the economy's health, will grow 2.8 percent this year
and 1.8 percent in 1990.
   That would represent a significant retreat from the robust 3.9
percent pace of growth last year.
   Jay N. Woodworth, president of the association and an economist
with Bankers Trust Co., said the report ``supports the case for a
soft landing to take place in the economy, ... a period of fairly
slow GNP growth, slow enough so that it takes the pressure off the
inflation rate, it takes the pressure off interest rates.''
   The anticipated slowdown also is likely to be accompanied by an
increase in unemployment and slower growth in industrial
production, the forecasters said.
   While signs of a slowdown already have been emerging, the
quarterly surveys by the business group have been becoming
gradually more optimistic about prospects for avoiding a recession.
   Forty-three percent of the 54 analysts surveyed earlier this
month predicted the next recession would occur in 1990, while 20
percent expect the nation's record peacetime expansion to end this
year.
   That projection is slightly more optimistic than the group's
last quarterly forecast, issued in February, when 75 percent of
those surveyed expected a recession this year or next. Last
November, 88 percent expected a recession by the end of next year.
   Recent government reports measuring the economy's performance so
far this year indicate that growth is slowing in response to a
Federal Reserve campaign to restrain economic growth and curb
inflation by pushing up interest rates.
   The government reported Thursday that the GNP grew at a 4.3
percent annual rate in the first three months of 1989, much slower
than previously thought. The pace was a lackluster 1.8 percent when
a statistical bounceback from last year's drought is excluded.
   But Woodworth said the new GNP report was ``good news'' because
it reflects a downward revision in the accumulation of inventories
held by businesses.
   If the group's economists were polled again now, they ``might be
just a trace more optimistic'' than they were when surveyed earlier
this month, Woodworth said.
   Despite their growing optimism, the forecasters acknowledged
that ``the real trick from an economic policy perspective is
preventing the forces that are responsible for a major slowdown
from degenerating into a full-blown recession.''
   ``Soft landings have often appeared possible ... but inflation
has invariably worsened,'' the group's report said. ``With the
run-up in prices, government policy has been forced to squeeze
still harder and soft landings are lost in the process.''
   The economists forecast that in conjunction with slower growth,
the unemployment rate will creep up from a 15-year low of 5 percent
in March, averaging 5.4 percent for all of 1989 and 5.8 percent in
1990.
   Inflation, which advanced at a sharp 6.6 percent pace in the
first four months of 1989, was expected to peak at the middle of
the year and then moderate. Price increases were forecast to
average 5.3 percent this year and 4.7 percent in 1990, up from 4.4
percent in 1988.
   Both long- and short-term interest rates were expected to
continue dropping, with current declines in rates already
outstripping the group's projections.
   The yield on three-month Treasury bills was projected to drop
from 8.8 percent in March to 7.3 percent in December 1990; yields
on 30-year Treasury bonds were estimated at 8.7 percent in December
1990, down from 9.2 percent this March.
   Progress on the country's twin trade and budget deficits,
meanwhile, was expected to continue over the next two years, but at
a slower pace.
   The median trade deficit forecast was $112 billion for 1989 and
$100 billion in 1990, down from $119.8 billion in 1988. The budget
deficit, which reached $155.1 billion in 1988, was pegged at $160
billion for 1989 and $140 billion in 1990.

   A court decided Thursday to reduce by two
years the 30-year sentence given to Mehmet Ali Agca, who tried to
assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981, the Italian news agency AGI
reported.
   A state prosecutor had called for a reduction in Agca's sentence
because of good behavior. Agca was awarded a reduction of 45 days
for every six months he had been in jail, or 720 days, AGI said.
   He received a life sentence, which in Italy is 30 years.
   Agca shot and wounded the pope on May 18, 1981, in St. Peter's
Square and wounded two American women. He has been serving his
sentence in prison in Ascoli Piceno, 85 miles northeast of Rome.
   He could be paroled in the year 2001.

the Navy said today.
   No injuries were reported among the Grunard's 135-member crew,

   ``They were able to get themselves free without assistance, but
we're not going into the details about how they were able to do

   Inspections of the hull and other components continued today at
the Point Loma submarine base at the mouth of San Diego Bay.
   The grounding is under investigation.

   The commission that oversees federal election
laws is heading to the Soviet Union for talks with that country's
Central Election Commission in Moscow.
   Federal Election Commission Chairman Danny Lee McDonald wrote a
memo to the agency's staff, announcing the trip ``with considerable
pride and great pleasure.''
   The six members of the commission and several senior employees
were invited by the Soviet government to visit Moscow, Leningrad
and Kiev. Expenses for the trip were being picked up by private
foundations and the Soviet government, commission spokeswoman
Sharon Snyder said.
   McDonald's memo was dated May 5, the 171st anniversary of the
birth of Karl Marx.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Volcanic Dust May Not Cool Climate</HEAD>
<NOTE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Weriter</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dust plumes spewed out by volcanoes, long
thought to cool the climate, may well have little weather effect, a
new study contends.
   ``Previous suggestions of large cooling during the first few
months after volcanic events appear to be unwarranted,''
researchers Clifford F. Mass and David A. Portman say in the June
issue of the Journal of Climate, published by the American
Meteorological Society.
   Volcanic eruptions have often been blamed for cooling of the
climate in the past, based on the theory that the dust they inject
into the atmosphere would block sunlight and reduce the normal
warming of the land and sea surface.
   Indeed, the cold weather in 1816, known to historians as ``the
year without a summer,'' has been widely blamed on a series of
volcanic eruptions that occurred in various parts of the world
between 1812 and 1815.
   In their study, Portman and Mass said prior analyses may have
been confused by temperature changes that involve a periodic
warming and cooling of sea and air temperatures, a pattern known as
the El Nino-Southern Oscillation.
   After subtracting those effects from the historical records,
they concluded that ``only the largest eruptions are suggested in
the climatic record and that a modest cooling is observed for one
to two years after these large events.''
   They defined modest cooling as about one-tenth to two-tenths of
a degree Celsius in average temperatures. That would amount to 0.2
to 0.4 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The authors found little hint of any effect on air pressure or
rain or snowfall.
   Considering that eruptions throwing dust into the air should
interfere with radiation from the sun, they asked themselves: ``Why
is the volcanic effect on surface climate so small?''
   The answer, they concluded, amounts to an altered form of the
greenhouse effect _ the currently widely discussed threatened
heating of the planet.
   ``Volcanic stratospheric aerosols can drastically reduce the
direct solar beam,'' they concluded, an effect which should lower
the temperature by reducing the warming from the sun.
   But at the same time these chemicals and dust also block
infrared rediation from the ground and ocean what would normally be
radiated back into space, cooling the planet.
   Because volcanic clouds often shade only a small portion of the
surface and have only a negligible net effect on the radiation
balance, they result in little measurable climate change, concluded
Mass, of the University of Washington in Seattle, and Portman of
Atmospheric and Environmental Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass.
   Records which seem to indicate cooling following eruptions could
reflect ordinary variations in climate, they conclude. In fact, a
more detailed analysis of the records indicates that in some cases
gradual cooling reported following eruptions had actually begun
beforehand.
   As for 1816, Mass and Portman conclude that it was an unusually
cold summer in North America and parts of Europe, but the degree of
cooling was not unprecedented. The cold year could have resulted
from consistent wind patterns bringing arctic air south, they said.
   The greenhouse effect which has become a source of concern in
recent years results from an accumulation of carbon dioxide and
other gases in the atmosphere, largely a result of burning fossil
fuels and other industrial processes.
   Like volcanic dust, these gases trap the earth's heat,
preventing it from radiating out into space and cooling the planet.
But unlike the volcanic dust, the greenhouse gases do not balance
things by blocking incoming sunlight.

   Rep. Donald Lukens denied having sex with
a teen-age girl but did offer her mother a job during a telephone
conversation secretly recorded by the FBI and police and played for
the jury today.
   On the tape, played on the fourth day of Lukens' trial on
charges of contributing to the delinquency or unruliness of a
minor, the congressman told the girl's mother that her daughter had
been calling, and he asked that she stop.
   Later, a private investigator J.D. Caudill testified that
Lukens, who is divorced, admitted to him in January that he had sex
with the girl and knew she was underage. The investigator had been
hired by Lukens' then-attorney.
   ``He admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with Rosie
Coffman,'' Caudill testified.
   After the prosecution completed its case, the defense rested
without calling any witnesses.
   Defense attorney Thomas Tyack said he would have introduced
testimony about the girl's juvenile record if the judge had not
ruled such evidence inadmissable.
   If convicted of the misdemeanor, Lukens, a 58-year-old
Republican, could be sentenced to six months in jail and fined
$1,000.
   During the taped Nov. 11 telephone conversation, Anna Coffman
told the congressman that her 17-year-old daughter, Rosie, had
confessed to her that she had sex with Lukens on Nov. 6.
   ``She was there with Mercedes. What Mercedes and I did was
private. Your daughter had nothing to do with it,'' Lukens replied,
according to the tape.
   Mercedes was the name used by Ms. Coffman's friend, Michelle
Foster, then 19, who had invited Ms. Coffman to Lukens' apartment
that night.
   Lukens also asked Mrs. Coffman whether she was still
``interested in the job.'' Mrs. Coffman testified earlier that
Lukens made her a job offer during a meeting between at a Columbus
fast-food restaurant earlier in the day.
   On Tuesday, Ms. Coffman testified that she had sex with Lukens
on the eve of her 17th birthday and lied to Lukens, telling him she
was turning 19 years old. But Ms. Coffman said she also gave him
her real birthdate _ Nov. 7, 1971.
   ``I told him my birthday was the next day,'' Ms. Coffman
testified. ``He asked me how old I was going to be. I told him 19
years old ... but I gave him my real birthdate. I wasn't thinking.
He wrote it down on a yellow tablet.''
   She also testified Wednesday in Domestic Relations Court that
Lukens gave her $40 and a birthday gift after she had sex with him
that night. Ms. Coffman also said Lukens made several racial slurs
during the evening.
   Lukens is white. Ms. Coffman is black.
   WSYX TV reporter Ted Hart continued testifying today on his role
in the videotaping of a Nov. 11 meeting between Lukens and Rosie
Coffman's mother at the fast-food restaurant.
   Hart, who arranged the taping, told the jury he never heard Mrs.
Coffman ask for money from Lukens. But he said he heard Lukens
offer to help Mrs. Coffman find a job after she explained that her
daughter was underage.
   Lukens has said Mrs. Coffman attempted to extort money from him
in exchange for her silence. Mrs. Coffman has testifed, however,
that Lukens tried to bribe her with an offer of help in finding a
government job.
   Lukens, who is divorced, served in Congress for two terms in the
1960s, then in the Ohio Senate before returning to Congress in
1986, representing the Middletown area in southwest Ohio.
   Rosie Coffman testified that she went to Lukens' apartment to
talk to him about their first meeting, in 1985. Under
cross-examination, however, she admitted she never did discuss the
1985 incident with Lukens and that she did not recall for sure
whether she told Lukens she was 18 or 19.
   The congressman appeared agitated as Ms. Coffman described in
graphic detail their alleged sexual encounter. At one point, he
balled up both fists and hit his knees. At other times, he shook
his head and scowled.
   Ms. Coffman said she and a friend, Michelle Foster, visited
Lukens at his home Nov. 6. Ms. Foster was 19 at the time.
   ``My friend Michelle gave me a call. She said she had met a
congressman. She called him by the name of `Buz,''' Ms. Coffman
said, referring to Lukens' nickname.
   At his apartment, she said she performed oral sex on Lukens and
had intercourse with him twice. She said Lukens gave her two $20
bills and paid Ms. Foster $30 even though Ms. Coffman said her
friend did not have sex with him.

<HEAD>Death Sentence For Murderer Who Said Blacks Are Not Human</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A white ex-policeman who said he
believes blacks are animals was sentenced to hang Thursday for
killing seven blacks and an Indian man in two shooting sprees he
hoped would provoke a race war.
   The killings by Barend Strydom were committed ``in an unfeeling
and cold-blooded manner that I have never before experienced or
heard of,'' said Justice Louis Harms. ``Mass murder or racial
murder will not be tolerated by this court.''
   In one of South Africa's most dramatic trials, relatives of the
black victims and white extremists supportive of Strydom crowded
into Pretoria Supreme Court for two weeks to hear testimony about
the 23-year-old defendant's racist beliefs.
   Harms convicted Strydom last week of killing seven people and
wounding 15 blacks in a rampage on the sidewalks of downtown
Pretoria on Nov. 15. A week earlier, Strydom said he killed a black
woman and wounded another at a squatter camp, using them as target
practice to determine whether he was ready for a larger-scale
massacre.
   After the sentencing, the white-supremacist Boerestaat Party
said it will campaign for clemency for Strydom. Boerestaat leader
Robert von Tonder said Strydom is ``a sensitive Afrikaner patriot.''
   Standing impassively for an hour while Harms read his ruling,
Strydom gulped a glass of water when the sentence was pronounced,
then was escorted to a police van and driven to death row at
Pretoria Central Prison.
   Police vehicles blockaded streets around the courthouse, and
scores of officers stood guard. They used dogs to control several
hundred people, mostly black, who waited in a park across the road.
   Harms gave Strydom eight death sentences and 30 years in prison
for 16 counts of attempted murder. No execution date was set, and
defense lawyers said they would appeal.
   Harms thanked Simon Mkonduleli, a black taxi driver who grabbed
Strydom's pistol to halt the Nov. 15 massacre. Mkonduleli said he
has been harassed and threatened by white men several times since
the rampage, including after Thursday's court session.
   Strydom had acknowledged that he smiled as he shot his victims,
telling the court last week, ``I'm a friendly person.''
   He testified he fired the first shots in a ``war of freedom''
for whites threatened by the country's black majority.
   ``I do not think blacks are human beings,'' he said.
   State-appointed psychiatrists concluded Strydom was sane.
   His father, also a former policeman, testified he taught his
children that blacks were animals.
   Defense lawyer Johan Engelbrecht argued Strydom viewed the
killings as self-defense, saying: ``He fears blacks, fears that the
government will yield and that whites will be sold out.''
   Harms drew a parallel between Strydom's case and that of Robert
McBride, a mixed-race guerrilla of the African National Congress
who argued he was taught to hate whites. McBride is on death row
after being sentenced for planting a bomb that killed three women
in 1986.
   The death sentence is mandatory for murder in South Africa
unless the judge determines there are mitigating circumstances.

<HEAD>Government Reports Economy Growing at Moderate Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a moderate 4.3
percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the
government said Thursday in a report which economists and the Bush
administration saw as a sign the country's record peacetime
expansion is continuing.
   The Commerce Department's revision in the first-quarter gross
national product to well below its original 5.5 percent estimate
came amid worries that Federal Reserve efforts to stem inflation
could move the economy into a recession.
   But Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the report shows
that ``Fed policy over the past year appears to be succeeding in
steering the economy to a more moderate, but sustainable, growth
path.''
   Michael Boskin, chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the report made him ``confident the economy will
continue (its) growth, inflation will be contained and the economy
will remain solid.''
   Some private economists said flatly that the report rules out
any recession for at least the remainder of the year. A survey of
economic forecasting experts conducted before the latest GNP
release also discounted any recession in 1989.
   ``Not only is there no sign of a recession in sight,'' said
Allen Sinai of the Boston Co., ``but the question now is whether we
will get a significant rebound in the second and third quarters.''
   Michael Evans of Evans Economics, Inc., agreed that ``the last
chance for a recession this year has just evaporated.
   ``The economy is in amazingly good shape,'' he said. ``There
seems to be no signs of a serious slowdown.''
   Both the 4.3 percent growth rate and the earlier 5.5 percent
estimate included the statistical effects of last year's drought on
the farm sector. Removing that sector means the non-farm economy
grew at only a 1.8 percent rate, compared with the earlier estimate
of 3.5 percent. This is the slowest quarterly non-farm GNP advance
in more than two years.
   Not all economists were encouraged by the report, however.
Lawrence A. Hunter, deputy chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said the non-farm growth rate means ``we have fallen
through the Fed's target for a `soft landing' and would be heading
directly to a `hard fall.'''
   The new report did not change the earlier 5 percent annual
inflation rate in the first quarter, compared with 4.2 percent in
the previous October-December period.
   As the Commerce Department announced the latest GNP, the
National Association of Business Economists released a survey
predicting a dramatic slowing in economic growth but also without
any recession during the remainder of the year.
   NABE President Jay N. Woodworth said in releasing the report
that the 54 forecasting experts in the survey ``might be just a
trace more optimistic today than they had said earlier this month''
when the survey was conducted.
   But the NABE survey suggested a moderate increase in
unemployment and higher inflation due to rising food and energy
prices.
   In yet another economic report, the National Association of
Realtors said rising mortgage rates continued their toll on
existing home sales. Sales fell by 1.1 percent in April, the fourth
consecutive monthly decline, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 3.36 million units, the report said. It was the slowest annual
rate since February 1988.
   Fed efforts to stem inflation by tightening credit have been
blamed for rising interest rates.
   The Commerce Department also reported Thursday that
first-quarter, after-tax corporate profits were off 1.7 percent.
The decline follows a 3.2 percent increase in 1988's last quarter
and was the biggest drop since a 2.5 percent fall in the fourth
quarter of 1987.
   In its GNP report, Commerce said the economy grew $43.1 billion
to $4.077 trillion in the first quarter when adjusted for
inflation. Without the inflation adjustment, growth increased $106
billion to $5.105 trillion _ the first quarter the GNP topped the
$5 trillion mark.
   A slower inventory build-up together with a faster export pace
than previously believed was most responsible for the downward
revision in the first-quarter GNP.
   The smaller inventory list was seen as a plus for the economy
because large build-ups without accompanying sales often mean job
layoffs.
   And the increased exports combined with fewer imports resulted
in a better-than-expected decline in the trade deficit. The report
said the deficit narrowed at an annual rate of $17.6 billion, the
first improvement since the spring of 1988. Exports in the
January-March quarter rose at a 15.3 percent annual rate compared
with a 0.9 percent increase in imports.

   Carla Brouwenstyn says she ``prayed
like I never prayed before'' for hours in Lake Michigan's chilly
and turbulent waters, trying in vain to save the lives of two
companions when their boat wrecked.
   Two people were dead and one missing after a 23-foot powerboat
crashed into a concrete breakwater Tuesday night outside Indiana
Harbor, authorities said. Ms. Brouwenstyn and the boat's owner
survived.
   Ms. Brouwenstyn, 21, of Highland, was found by a fisherman
Wednesday morning, more than eight hours after the wreck, said
Deputy Police Chief Angelo Machuca.
   She was found clinging to the body of one of her friends,
21-year-old Rhonda Russell of Hammond, Machuca said. She had also
tried through the night to hang onto another friend, Christyne
Mason, 21, of Hammond, but lost her grip in the choppy, 52-degree
water. Ms. Mason was missing and presumed dead, authorities said.
The search for her body resumed Thursday.
   ``This brave lady, Carla, trying to hold on to her friends, was
in the water from 10 o'clock last night until the fisherman found
her at 6:30,'' Machuca said.
   The boat's owner, Gary Gaskin, 25, also of Hobart, was found
alive, hanging onto the damaged boat, which had drifted away from
where Ms. Brouwenstyn were found, Machuca said. But the driver of
the boat, John Clifford, 25, of Hobart, was found dead on the boat.
   Ms. Brouwenstyn was listed serious but stable condition Thursday
at St. Catherine Hospital in East Chicago. Gaskin was listed in
guarded condition at St. Mary's Medical Center in Gary.
   Brenda Brouwenstyn said her sister was ``a pretty strong girl. I
never would have made it.''
   ``I prayed like I never prayed before,'' the family quoted Ms.
Brouwenstyn as saying from her hospital bed. ``I kept asking for
God's help. I will have a different attitude on life from now on.''
   The five left from Portage on Tuesday night for a trip to
Chicago, but the choppy water changed their plans.
   ``About 10 o'clock the water started getting rough, and they
turned around to come back,'' Machuca said. ``The boat hit the
breakwall at the very north end of Inland Steel in our city. The
boat broke up.''

straight overhead. For that moment skinny people, flagpoles and
buildings will cast no shadow.
   Among the 50 states, it's a phenomenon unique to Hawaii,
occurring twice a year because it's in the tropics.
   To mark the occasion, the Bishop Museum Planetarium issued a
tongue-in-cheek public advisory that:
   _It's a good day for taking outdoor group photographs, because
nobody will be in anybody else's shadow.
   _You can safely wax the sides of your car.
   _Moss won't be able to tell which side of the tree to grow on.
   _Bald men should stay indoors, wear hats or add extra sunscreen.
   _People who tell time with a sundial should get a wristwatch.
   _Shadow boxers should sit out the round.
   _You can play ``Who's shadow is the longest?'' with your tallest

really hit the kids.''
   The 342 students who attended Willow Run from 1965-69 have been

   House Majority Leader Tom Foley offers a
striking contrast to Speaker Jim Wright and that is a big reason
why so many congressmen _ Republicans as well as Democrats _ hope
he soon will become speaker.
   As House members scattered Thursday at the start of a long
Memorial Day weekend, there was a clear sense that the ethics
controversy surrounding Wright was overwhelming him and forcing him
to step down.
   ``I know of no plans for the speaker to retire,'' said Foley who
flew to Seattle to attend the funeral of former Democratic Sen.
Warren Magnuson. ``The speaker, as far as I know, intends to go
forward now with the regular process of the evidentiary hearing.''
   That was something Democrats clearly hoped was not the case. In
fact, some seemed eager to have Foley take over the leadership of
the House.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley,'' said Rep.
Pat Williams, D-Mont.
   During the period of turmoil and tension in the House, why is
the Washington congressman considered such a shoo-in to be the next
speaker?
   Part of the answer is tradition. As majority leader, Foley
occupies the post that customarily is the stepping-stone to the
speakership. Wright moved up after serving as majority leader and
so did his predecessor, Thomas P. O'Neil, as did his predecessor,
Carl Albert, and his, John McCormack.
   But that logic of succession doesn't fully account for Foley's
unique standing during this troubled time.
   It's more a case of perception.
   ``The speaker's problems have translated into institutional
problems for all of us,'' said Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas.
``The institution is getting a black eye.''
   During the little more than two years he has been speaker,
Wright proved a strong leader who gave the Democrats the initiative
on many issues during the last two years of Ronald Reagan's
presidency, though he was not given high marks for his more recent
handling of the unsuccessful push for a congressional pay raise.
   ``I think when the history of the House in this era is written,
Jim Wright's tenure in the 100th Congress will be compared with
Henry Clay in the 12th Congress or Joe Cannon in the 58th or Sam
Rayburn in the 76th,'' said Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., a member
of the House ethics committee.
   ``But we're not here to stand in judgment of Jim Wright's
speakership,'' went on Atkins.
   What the committee was examining was the speaker's book deal,
his oil well deal, his partnership with Texas businessman George
Mallick.
   What finally confronted the Democrats were the allegations _
accurate or not _ that Wright profited from his power at the
pinnacle of the House.
   Ironically, as the case against Wright began to unfold early in
the 101st Congress, the Senate was flourishing under new
leadership, that of Sen. George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   If anyone in the House leadership could be compared to Mitchell,
it was Foley. Both men come across as down-to-earth types, who
adhere to principles without being unduly partisan. Both are
effective on television.
   Some of the highest praise for Foley comes from Republicans.
   ``Tom Foley is just a very able, capable individual,'' said Rep.
Bob Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader. ``He's well
liked on our side, and he's also recognized as a very formidable
opponent, one who will state the case well, and he is eminently
fair.''
   ``He's a man of total integrity,'' said Senate GOP leader Bob
Dole of Kansas.
   One rainy October evening in Seattle during the 1988
presidential campaign provided an example of Foley's self-effacing
style.
   Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis had just addressed a huge
downtown crowd. The speech over, the campaign retinue raced through
the downpour to the waiting vehicles.
   A rain-soaked Foley, a large, gray-haired bear of a man,
approached a Dukakis staff car and was waived away.
   As he started walking away, reporters in the next car invited
him to join them. He did and, laughing off the incident, regaled
them with stories of similar occasions.
   Already one of the nation's most powerful politicians, he
demonstrated an ability to avoid taking himself too seriously.

   More and more Americans know people can get AIDS
from sexual intercourse with an infected person but not from casual
contact with an AIDS victim, a federal study released Thursday
shows.
   The study, based on about 3,500 interviews a month from August
1987 to August 1988 and conducted by the federal Centers for
Disease Control's National Center for Health Statistics, indicates
that Americans think they know more about AIDS than before and that
they may be right.
   But it may be years before the improvement shows up in a drop in
reported new AIDS cases, because some people can be infected with
the AIDS virus for 10 years before symptoms appear, federal
researchers say.
   The CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report released
Thursday in Atlanta said the overall gain in knowledge about
acquired immune deficiency syndrome coincides with a national
public awareness campaign.
   It said the effect of one element of the campaign, the mailing
of an AIDS fact brochure to most American households in May and
June of 1988, is being analyzed.
   The report said the percentage of parents who discussed AIDS
with their children remained constant at about 60 percent but that
those reporting their children had AIDS education in schools was up
from 36 percent to 59 percent.
   The adults correctly answering it was ``definitely true'' that
AIDS was an infectious disease caused by a virus rose from 44
percent to 64 percent.
   Other study findings included:
   _Those who knew it is very unlikely or impossible to contract
AIDS by working near someone who has the disease increased from 53
percent to 67 percent.
   _The percentage of people saying the knew ``a lot'' or ``some''
about AIDS increased from 60 to 66 percent.
   _Those correctly answering that it is ``definitely true'' that
AIDS can be transmitted through intercourse with an infected person
increased from 75 percent to about 85 percent.

   An 11-year-old boy appearing in
juvenile court for violating terms of a sentence was ordered locked
up for a night because he refused to wear a tie.
   The boy, whose name was not released because of his age,
appeared in court Tuesday wearing a T-shirt and shorts, in
violation of Circuit Judge Robert Foster's dress code for juvenile
court.
   The judge instituted the dress code about a year ago, telling
boys to wear neckties and trousers and girls to wear slacks or
dresses. Foster said this was the first time a child had been
detained for violating the code.
   The boy, convicted of petty theft, was brought into court
Tuesday for violating his sentence, which required him to work 40
hours in the Youth Mediation Program.
   Foster said the boy had been told at least five times that he
must wear a tie and slacks to court and had done so in past court
appearances.
   However, when the youth appeared Tuesday, his mother said he had
refused to wear a tie and the shirt she had ironed for him.
   Foster ordered the boy to spend the night at the detention
center and told the mother to take the shirt and tie to the
detention center. The boy returned to court Wednesday in the proper
attire.

<HEAD>Bush Heads for NATO Summit Clouded By Discord</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush departs Friday for a NATO
summit clouded by discord over nuclear strategy and concerns that
Moscow is driving a wedge in the Western alliance with politically
appealing disarmament offers.
   On the eve of his departure, Bush received a new message from
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who is pushing for superpower
talks to slash arsenals of short-range nuclear missiles _ the issue
that separates Washington and Bonn. However, presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said the two sides were still at an impasse.
   ``The consultations are about where they have been,'' Fitzwater
said. ``The issue is still an open one ... but it has not been
resolved at this point.''
   He said ``time is running out'' on chances to resolve the
quarrel before the leaders of the 16 NATO countries meet in
Brussels on Monday. Playing down the dispute, Fitzwater said, ``We
don't believe it will overwhelm or dominate the summit and it
should not and will not be allowed to.''
   Bush's trip _ his first to Europe as president _ will take him
to Italy, Belgium, West Germany and England.
   The journey is an important step for Bush as he tries to
establish himself as a world statesman and attempts to counter the
success of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in projecting himself
as a peacemaker with a series of promises to cut military spending,
arms and troops.
   Coming on the heels of Ronald Reagan's series of five summits
with Gorbachev and the signing of a major U.S.-Soviet arms
agreement, ``Bush is between a rock and a hard place,'' said
University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato.
   ``The rock is Reagan and the hard place is Gorbachev. Between
the two giants he's coming out on the short end,'' Sabato said.
   Norm Ornstein, a political analyst at the American Enterprise
Institute, said European leaders all know Bush and regard him with
``a sense of predictability and familiarity.
   ``At the same time, I don't think there's a sense of awe or a
feeling we've got somebody in there who can keep up with
Gorbachev,'' Ornstein said.
   He said Bush ``needs to show that the leader of the free world
is going to be just that.''
   Before arriving in Brussels, Bush will spend two nights in Rome.
He will meet with Italian leaders, have an audience with the Pope
John Paul II and deliver an address previewing the NATO summit. The
speech site is the American cemetery at Nettuno, the burial site of
7,850 men and 12 women who were killed in World War II.
   He will go to Bonn after the summit for a two-day visit and then
stop in London before flying to his vacation home in Kennebunkport,
Maine, on June 2.
   The NATO summit was intended an as anniversary party toasting
the strength of the Western Alliance and celebrating 40 years of
peace in Europe.
   However, the missile dispute with Bonn has marred the atmosphere.
   The rift was triggered by Germany's demand for the United States
and the Soviet Union to begin negotiations soon to reduce and
possibly eliminate nuclear missiles on both sides with a range of
up to 300 miles.
   Bush has opposed opening talks, saying he would not go along
with any steps leading to the elimination of nuclear weapons in
Europe. In a gesture of compromise, Bush agreed last week to the
principle of negotiations, but under conditions that would put off
any talks for years.
   The West German government also is resisting a joint
U.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missiles
to just below 300 miles. All U.S. and Soviet missiles with ranges
between 300 and 3,000 miles were banned under a 1987 treaty.
   The U.S.-built Lances now can hit targets from about 75 miles.
Most of the 88 launchers, carrying about 700 single-warhead
missiles, are based in West Germany.
   ``It's nothing new that a new president faces a test from
Moscow,'' said Burton Pines, senior vice president and director of
research at the Heritage Foundation. ``The first test of Bush is
not coming from Moscow. It's Bonn which is testing the new
president.''
   ``It's going to be a crossroads summit,'' said William J.
Taylor, vice president for political-military affairs at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies.
   ``Our forecast for at least the last six years has been that by
the late 1980s, NATO cohesion would be under serious challenge and
there was a reasonable probability of the disintegration of NATO,''
he said.
   Bush rejects that kind of scenario. ``I have a feeling that
there's been a lot of smoke and that we'll have a good summit,'' he
said recently.
   ``This alliance is not going to fall apart. It is going to stay
together and be strong,'' Bush said.
   However, the administration readily acknowledges there are major
strains on the alliance.
   ``The glue that has kept it together and has overcome all the
divisive issues that always plague the alliance _ it's always in
trouble _ the glue has been the threat of the Soviet Union,'' said
a senior administration official, one of the top advisers to Bush.
   ``Well, you know, maybe that's not true anymore, and there's a
growing perception that, hey, there isn't going to be an attack in
Europe. So we need to infuse the alliance with some new unifier,''
added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   The United States and Laos are about to begin

have died during the Vietnam War, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   The excavation, scheduled to begin Friday, will be the sixth
such joint project since the end of the war. Previous excavations
have resulted in the recovery of remains that were later identified
by a U.S. laboratory.
   ``The United States government appreciates this step by the Lao
government toward establishing a year-round program of cooperative
efforts to resolve the POW-MIA issue,'' the Pentagon said.
   The last excavation was conducted in March. The site about to be
searched was surveyed in December 1988, and is located in the
Savannakhet Province in southern Laos.

   Two U.S. diplomats have been expelled
from Nicaragua for allegedly instigating wildcat strikes by
teachers seeking higher pay, the government announced today.
   Dionisio Marenco, spokesman for the ruling Sandinista party,
identified the diplomats as Kathleen Williamson Barnon, the U.S.
attache for Central American labor affairs who is based in
Honduras, and Joel Franklin Cassman, economic attache at the U.S.
Embassy in Nicaragua.
   Marenco said the two officials ``were expelled for interfering
in the internal affairs of the country.'' He said they ``went
around distributing money and exhorting the teachers to strike.''
   Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto met this morning with John
Leonard, the U.S. Embassy's attache for business affairs, to inform
him of the expulsions.
   In Washington, State Department officials said they had not been
been informed of the expulsions.
   Marenco said Ms. Barnon had been in Nicaragua for two days and
that Cassman had been in the country a week before the expulsion
orders were issued.
   Radio Sandino reported earlier today that the expulsions were
ordered by President Daniel Ortega and Foreign Minister Miguel
D'Escoto.
   Barricada, the official newspaper of the Sandinista National
Liberation Front, also accused the U.S. Embassy of fomenting the
wildcat strikes.
   Barricada reported strikes in two provincial cities, raising to
three the number of municipalities outside Managua where teachers
have split from their national labor union and struck to demand
better pay and working conditions.
   In Managua, teachers at two schools have threatened to strike if
the leftist government fails to answer their demands.

   House Speaker Jim Wright is considering
resigning his post next week, regardless of whether the House
ethics committee first agrees to drop charges against him,
congressional leadership sources said today.
   The sources, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
speaker had not yet made a firm decision to abdicate but the
Democratic leadership was making arrangements for a resignation
speech before the House next Wednesday.
   ``I think he just wants his day in the well'' of the House, said
one source close to the arrangements.
   Democrats have begun speaking of a succession in which Rep.
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., the majority leader, would move up to
speaker as early as next week.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley,'' Rep. Pat
Williams of Montana said Wednesday. Foley himself said today he
knew of ``no plans for the speaker to retire.''
   Wright, D-Texas, remained secluded in his office today. But he
issued a statement indicating he was no longer counting on success
from the efforts of his lawyers on Wednesday to convince the House
ethics committee to drop charges of financial improprieties against
him in exchange for his stepping down, sources said.
   ``There is no deal now. There will be no deal in the future,''
the statement said.
   Wright's statement was issued as Republicans toughened their
stance that any ``plea bargain'' would be improper.
   Publicly, Wright insisted he would ``press ahead'' with his
defense against the charges in the House ethics committee.
   At the same time, he dispatched his lawyers to explore
alternatives to what could be weeks of trying to change the minds
of committee members who brought the charges against him.
   The speaker's lawyers, meeting Wednesday with attorneys for the
ethics committee, offered his post in exchange for dismissal of the
charge that he accepted improper gratuities from a developer
friend, according to sources familiar with the talks.
   Some sources said Wright might subsequently resign from the
House, where he has served since 1955.
   One alleged gift was a job for Betty Wright. The committee's
outside counsel says she did little if any work for her salary.
Wright says she did, and has vowed in sometimes dramatic statements
to protect her honor.
   The talks on Wednesday included suggestions that the
conflict-of-interest charges could be narrowed to eliminate the
years when Mrs. Wright's job was involved.
   Rep. John Myers of Indiana, ranking Republican on the ethics
committee, said today he ``would not be party to such a deal.''
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., the House minority whip, said of
Wright, ``As long as he's a member of the House I think our
position is that it is totally inappropriate for the ethics
committee to engage in plea bargaining.''
   ``On the other hand, if the speaker thinks the ethics commitee
has a sound case he has every right to collapse,'' Gingrich said on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   House GOP campaign officials have said Wright's ethics will make
a juicy campaign issue for them in 1990.
   Meyers said ethics committee members Wednesday afternoon
authorized outside counsel Richard Phelan to hold discussions _ but
not negotiations _ with Wright's lawyers. Phelan met with Rep.
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a member of the speaker's defense team.
   House Republican leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., who was keeping tabs
on the talks, told reporters that, ``Quite frankly, the integrity
of the ethics committee might very well be undermined if they were
to succumb to that kind of entreaty'' from the speaker.
   He said if he were up against the kind of charges facing the
speaker, he would have resigned already.
   Still, one congressman familiar with the talks, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said a majority of the ethics committee
favored some sort of negotiated settlement. The committee is made
up of six Democrats and six Republicans.
   Publicly, Wright himself refused to concede his 35-year
legislative career might be nearing an end, or even that Democrats
were losing confidence in him. ``I don't feel that at all,'' he
told reporters.
   The speaker's search for a political solution to his dilemma
came only one day after his lawyers made a dramatic televised pitch
to the committee that the charges should be dropped for legal
reasons.
   The committee recessed Wednesday until June 1 without making a
decision on the legal arguments.
   Committee chairman Julian Dixon met privately with Majority
Leader Foley to discuss the situation. Neither man would discuss
their talks publicly.
   Some said they expected a deal would be made before that next
committee meeting.
   ``What I know is that negotiations are taking place that deal
with resolving this issue very soon,' Rep. Bill Richardson said
Wednesday. Richardson said he expected an arrangement to be made
within a day or two.
   While dropping all or part of the conflict-of-interest charge
was discussed, sources said the committee was not receptive to any
arrangement that would clear Wright of charges that he evaded House
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book,
``Reflections of a Public Man.''
   Wright was something other than a public man on Wednesday.
   He skipped a Democratic Party event staged to highlight their
fight with President Bush over the minimum wage bill, which Bush
has promised to veto.
   He spoke briefly with reporters who threw out questions as he
entered a meeting with his Texas House colleagues, and spent most
of the day in a series of meetings with his supporters and his
leadership team before leaving the Capitol early in the evening.
   He issued a statement insisting on his innocence.
   ``I very firmly believe that my position is right. I hope and
trust that the committee will consider the matter on its merits and
dismiss the charges.
   ``I eagerly await the time and opportunity when my side of this
whole question may be heard clearly by my colleagues and the
American people. To this end, I shall press ahead.''
   Richardson, reflecting the weariness of House Democrats, agreed
with the speaker that it was important ``that his case be made.''
But he added: ``That was done yesterday,'' referring to Tuesday's
televised hearing.
   While Foley was considered a sure thing for the speaker's job,
Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri did not dampen speculation that
he might seek the speaker's job or perhaps Foley's current
position. The Democratic whip, Tony Coelho of California, caucus
chairman Bill Gray of Pennsylvania, deputy whip David Bonior of
Michigan, and Rep. Lee Hamilton of Indiana were also mentioned as
seeking to move up in the leadership.

<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising mortgage rates slowed the sale of
existing homes in April to the worst pace in 14 months, the
National Association of Realtors reported Thursday.
   The trade group said sales of single-family homes declined last
month to an annual rate of 3.36 million units, down 1.1 percent
from March, off 4.3 percent from a year ago, and the lowest figure
since February of 1988.
   ``Higher interest rates have stymied efforts of renters to
become homeowners,'' NAR President Ira Gribin said.
   ``Trade-up buyers, in large part, are driving the market now,''
he added. ``First-time buyers, with no equity and a tight budget,
continue to be left behind, particularly in high-cost areas.''
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said that interest on
fixed-rate conventional mortgages ranged between 11.07 percent and
11.03 percent in April, up more than 0.5 percent from a year ago.
The interest-rate increase results from Federal Reserve efforts to
stem inflation by tightening credit.
   The NAR said a 7.5 percent
   drop in existing home sales in the West, which had recently
experienced heavy resale activity, led the April decline. And there
was flat activity in the South, which previously had the highest
sales volume.
   Sales in the West declined to an annual pace of 620,00 homes; in
the South the rate remained 1.27 million units yearly.
   Sales actually rose 7 percent in the Northeast, to an annual
rate of 610,000 units, and were up 2.3 percent in the Midwest, to a
rate of 890,000 units.
   The national median price for existing single-family homes was
$93,500 in April, the NAR said. That was up 6.3 percent from a year
ago and $1,500 higher than in March. Analysts said this primarily
reflected the higher costs of move-up homes.

   Corporations' after-tax profits fell 1.7
percent in the first quarter of 1989, the biggest decline in more
than a year, the government said Thursday.
   In a report indicating earnings are slowing along with the
economy, the Commerce Department said after-tax profits dipped to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $171.6 billion during the first
quarter, down from $174.5 billion during the previous three-month
period.
   Decreases in profits were widespread within manufacturing
industries, while earnings in trade, transportation, public
utilities and other non-manufacturing industries also fell.
   After-tax profits had risen 14.7 percent during 1988, reflecting
the robust economic growth that occurred last year, but earnings
are widely expected to fade this year as the economy slows and
labor costs rise.
   Economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. called it a ``standard
late-stage business expansion phenomenon'' for earnings to fall as
an economic recovery ages.
   The first-quarter falloff in after-tax profits was the biggest
drop since a 2.5 decline registered in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   ``The momentum of growth in profits in the first quarter showed
significant signs of beginning to fade and that will be the story
on profits for the next year,'' Sinai predicted.
   Among the details in the profits report:
   _Before-tax profits edged down 0.2 percent last quarter, to a
seasonally adjusted annual level of $319.9 billion, after rising
2.1 percent during the previous three-month period.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, fell 6.3 percent last quarter, to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of $319.3 billion, after rising 3.3 percent in
the fourth quarter.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, fell 5.3 percent last quarter, to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $388.1 billion, after rising
3.4 percent during the fourth quarter.
   _Dividend payments to stockholders rose 2.9 percent in the first
quarter, to an annual rate of $111.1 billion, following a 2.2
percent rise in the fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Some Democrats Worry Ethics Questions Could Make Coelho a Political
Target</HEAD>

   Some House Democrats worried Thursday that
ethics questions raised about House Majority Whip Tony Coelho could
make him an inviting political target if the feisty Californian
becomes majority leader.
   But the former Democratic congressional campaign chairman, who
dispensed money for many members' successful re-election campaigns,
still enjoys significant backing among colleagues.
   Coelho could face a challenge from Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,
who was an unsuccessful presidential candidate last year. One
Democratic member, who spoke only on condition he not be named,
said ``there's a good chance'' Gephardt would run for majority
leader.
   Democrats said in interviews their problems could be compounded
if Speaker Jim Wright resigned because of ethics charges, and _
after Rep. Thomas Foley, D-Wash., moved from majority leader to
speaker _ Coelho was sitting in the No. 2 spot with an ethics cloud
over his head.
   Some colleagues suggested that a way out would be to quickly
elect Foley as speaker and allow several weeks to pass before
deciding on other leadership positions.
   ``We must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has any
impediments that cause problems,'' said Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.
``If we have a secondary ethics problem, it could be very
catastrophic for our party in the House. We're on somewhat shaky
footing now and need to re-establish our stability.''
   Glickman said a cooling-off period after election of Foley would
allow races to develop and time to gauge reaction to Coelho's
ethics problems.
   News stories have detailed, and Coelho has confirmed, that a
California savings and loan official purchased a $100,000
high-yield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 _ after Coelho found
himself unable to finance the purchase himself.
   A month later, the bank official sold the bond to Coelho for the
initial offering price, which saved the lawmaker about $4,000
compared with the market price at the time.
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyone
with a direct interest in legislation. Coelho said he did not
violate House rules, and asked the ethics committee to review the
transaction.
   On Thursday, the Los Angeles Times reported the Justice
Department is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of
whether Coelho received favors from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
the firm that issued the junk bond.
   Coelho said in a statement, ``I am confident the story is
inaccurate and I so advised the Los Angeles Times, which chose to
go ahead with the story anyway. In Washington's current atmosphere,
such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable, but
no less regrettable.''
   The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Coelho
owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he
was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some
dairy farms.
   Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., said House Democrats should not
immediately fill the majority leader, whip and caucus chairman
positions should Wright resign, but added the Coelho camp wants the
incumbents to quickly move up the ladder.
   Williams said some members believe Coelho has ``put a lid on the
junk bond matter,'' but when informed of the story on a possible
criminal probe, said, ``any continuation of the investigation ...
would of course have a negative effect on (his) chances.''
   Coelho's strongest support appeared to come from his own
California Democratic delegation, whose chairman, Rep. Don Edwards,
said, ``We just think Tony has been the best whip in the history of
the House, and deserves to be majority leader.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said of Coelho's ethics
questions, ``People want answers, but I don't see a panic about it
at all.''
   And Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., a Coelho supporter, said that
``members will take into consideration the public reaction to the
situation.''

   A gasoline pipeline exploded today
in a cauldron of flames that engulfed the neighborhood where a
runaway train demolished a row of houses May 12. At least two
people were killed, 24 injured and seven homes destroyed, officials
said.
   Flames reached 500 feet into the sky, and black and gray smoke
towered thousands of feet following the blast at 8:11 a.m. in the
14-inch line.
   ``My windows started shattering. The houses were on fire, the
cars. One man ran out. He was in flames,'' said June Chung, whose
home in Rialto overlooks the scene about a mile away.
   ``It's just a terrible scene. It looks like a bomb went off over
Duffy Street,'' said City Attorney James Penman.
   The explosion occurred in a pipeline buried six feet below the
site of the train wreck earlier this month. The pipeline had been
inspected and reopened by Calnev Pipeline Co. several days ago
after the city was assured it was safe, Penman said.
   ``Obviously, in this case, the experts were wrong. Calnev has
got a lot of explaining to do,'' said Penman.
   At least two people died in the blast, city fire spokesman Paul
Allaire said.
   Sgt. Dan Hernandez said seven homes were destroyed by flames
across the street from where the freight train destroyed six houses
and damaged five earlier this month. Twenty homes threatened by the
inferno were evacuated, Penman said.
   Seven people who were burned, one seriously, were at San
Bernardino County Medical Center, said Eleanor Borkowski, a
spokeswoman. Five more people were being treated for minor injuries
at St. Bernardine's hospital, and 12 others at San Bernardino
Community Hospital, officials said.
   ``There's some people we are looking for,'' said Mayor Evlyn
Wilcox as she comforted a weeping woman who said she lost
everything.
   On May 12, a 69-car Southern Pacific freight train jumped the
tracks on a mountain pass at 90 mph, killing two crew members and
two boys in a home.
   Part of the pipeline, which carries fuel from Los Angeles-area
refineries to Las Vegas, was exposed after the train wreck, when
crews had to move earth to salvage the freight cars. The
neighborhood was evacuated for several days for fear the line had
been weakened.
   Railroad spokesman Jerry Pera said it is possible the
catapulting freight cars damaged the underground pipeline.
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators who probed
the train wreck were returning. ``Obviously, we have to see if
there's a connection,'' said NTSB spokesman Alan Pollock in
Washington.
   ``I'm out of my house again. We don't have nowhere to go,'' said
LaRuth Littlejohn, 51, who lives a block from the explosion site
and was evacuated during the train wreck.
   Mrs. Littlejohn said she saw one girl burned and helped carry
away a woman hurt when her house exploded.
   ``I was astounded,'' said Kevin Chafee, describing the explosion
and fire from six miles away. ``There's a huge tower of black smoke
going up over San Bernardino. I thought downtown San Bernardino was
on fire.''
   A witness Steve Blade, reporting from 200 feet away, said six
homes were engulfed in flames moments after the explosion.
   It wasn't immediately known how much gas was burning, said Jed
Robinson, Calnev general manager.
   The flow of gas was shut off when an automatic alarm signaled a
drop in pressure, Robinson said. ``The fact the fire has continued
to burn makes us think there might be a leak in the check valve,''
he said.
   The line carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank farm
in Colton, which is several miles from the blaze site, to southern
Nevada.

   Actor Lee Majors says he didn't hesitate to
invest more than $3 million in two oil-patch businesses because he
considered their president and chief operating officer a friend.
   Television's former ``Six Million Dollar Man'' now claims he
lost $1.5 million because of his investments in two Enid
oil-drilling-rig companies operated by Vaughn Good.
   He appeared in court Wednesday to testify on a lawsuit that he
and investor Ray Davis filed against Good and his wife, Laura. The
two men are seeking $3 million in actual damages plus unspecified
punitive damages.
   Majors said Good was a father figure to him after they met in
1971 when Good was his host during the Grand National Quail Hunt,
which each year draws celebrities to Enid.
   The actor testified that he was flattered in July 1980 when Good
asked him to invest in one of his companies. Without contacting his
business manager, Majors said, he signed a personal line of credit
of $600,000 to get a 30 percent share in the company. Two months
later, Majors said, he invested $2.6 million in a second drilling
company operated by Good.
   He testified that he would not have invested in either company
had he known of a number of questionable financial transactions
that he claimed eventually cost him $1.5 million.
   In their lawsuit, Majors and Davis claim that the Goods used
company money to pay personal bills and buy expensive oil-field
equipment only to turn around and sell it and keep the profit for
themselves.
   The Goods' attorney, Stephen Jones, claimed the legal dispute
stems from ``sour grapes,'' partly because of the drop in oil
prices after the 1982 oil bust. The trial on the lawsuit continued
Thursday.

   Roger Ebert gives a great big thumb's-up to
alphabetizing his video collection; Gene Siskel says deep-six that
A-to-Z nonsense.
   The two Chicago-based movie reviewers, famed for their bickering
on their syndicated television show, differ in their video habits
as well. Siskel collects old-time musicals, old TV game shows and
classic baseball footage; Ebert amasses opera, Hitchock, Japanese
movies and obscure examples of the ``film noir'' genre.
   Both prefer laser discs to tape; both have such films as
``Notorious,'' ``Raging Bull'' and ``Citizen Kane'' in their troves.
   But while Siskel owns one X-rated feature _ ``Last Tango in
Paris'' _ Ebert has a complete collection of the sexploitation
films of Russ Meyer, for whom he once wrote a screenplay, ``Beyond
the Valley of the Dolls'' of 1970.
   ``By definition, if I like a movie, it can't be bad,'' Ebert
says in the June issue of Self magazine.

   A writer who claimed the makers of the
1986 hit movie ``Hoosiers'' stole his screenplay has agreed to
settle his 2-year-old lawsuit.
   Michael Lilly, 47, had sought $1 million from Hemdale Film
Corp., claiming ``Hoosiers,'' starring Gene Hackman and Dennis
Hopper, was based on his script ``Bird Man of Flat Gap.''
   ``There are no hurt feelings. It's an excellent story,'' Lilly
said after the settlement was announced. Lilly, who lives in Cocoa
Beach, said the settlement this week amounted to less than $100,000.
   Under the terms, Lilly agreed to drop the appeal, and Hemdale
will not be required to acknowledge whether the film was based on
Lilly's script.
   His script involved a new high school basketball coach in a
rural mining town in Kentucky. ``Hoosiers'' takes place in a town
in Indiana.
   In both stories, the team's coach falls in love with a teacher,
the son of the town drunk is the team's key player, and the
underdogs win the state championship because of the final shot by a
player who originally did not want to join the team.
   In January, U.S. District Judge G. Kendall Sharp threw Lilly's
lawsuit out of court in Orlando. Sharp ruled that Lilly failed to
get the script copyrighted before distributing it to movie agents.
   Lilly appealed that ruling on the grounds that many writers
register their works with the Writers Guild in Southern California
instead of getting a copyright.

   Harvard University on Thursday named
former Atlanta Journal-Constitution editor William Kovach as
interim head of the Nieman Fellowship program to replace the ailing
Howard Simons.
   The program offers journalists who are in midcareer a year off
to study any topic they want at Harvard.
   Simons, 59, is suffering from pancreatic cancer and has gone on
an indefinite medical leave of absence, school officials said. He
took charge of the Nieman program in 1984.
   Kovach, 57, was with The New York Times for 18 years, including
a stint as Washington bureau chief before moving to Atlanta. He
departed last year after a well-publicized dispute with the
Journal-Constitution's publisher, and is winding up a year as a
Nieman fellow.
   Harvard President Derek Bok said Simons, former managing editor
of The Washington Post, helped expand the role of journalists at
the university.
   ``Howard has brought to the program impressive experience, good
judgment, and a keen interest in each fellow,'' Bok said. ``We will
miss him more than I can say.''
   Simons was a Nieman fellow himself in 1958, and then rose from
science reporter at the Post to become managing editor in 1971. In
that role, he helped oversee the newspaper's Pulitzer Prize-winning
coverage of the Watergate scandal.

   Laws intended to make polluters pay for oil
spills and toxic wastes are not working because the government
hasn't been willing to spend enough to assess the damages, a House
subcommittee was told Thursday.
   State environmental prosecutors from New York and Massachusetts
said Interior Department regulations, coupled with the lack of
funds for assessment studies, actually obstruct more than enhance
efforts to make polluters pay.
   ``The rules so severely limited the damages collectable that, to
our knowledge, no state trustees have used the regulations in the
almost three years since their promulgation,'' said New York
Assistant Attorney General Gordon Johnson.
   ``The only winners have been the polluters,'' Johnson told the
House Merchant Marine Committee's subcommittee on fisheries and
wildlife conservation.
   Administration officials conceded a dearth of damage
assessments, both for the hundreds of major oil spills that have
occurred since the 1972 Clean Water Act was passed, and for
corporate liabilities under the 1980 Superfund law to clean up
thousands of toxic waste sites.
   Officials for the Interior and Commerce departments as well as
the Environmental Protection Agency all said separate funds for
assessments were opposed by the Reagan administration, and that
none of their agencies have money for them.
   But they said the Bush administration is now ``rethinking'' that
view in light of the Valdez tanker spill in Alaska in March, and
noted that President Bush is seeking money to assess damages as
part of his proposal to establish a $500 million oil spill cleanup
fund.
   Louise Wise, deputy director of the EPA's office of marine and
estuarine protection, said her agency had opposed setting money
aside for assements out of fears it would deplete actual cleanup
funds provided for toxic waste dumps under the Superfund law.
   ``We are talking to our administrator about reconsidering our
position,'' she said.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., the subcomittee's chairman,
encouraged that effort, saying of Bush, ``The president has enough
middle names without adding `maybe' to the list.''
   Because there is no money for the damage assessments, Studds
said, compensation cannot be obtained.
   Erik Olson of the National Wildlife Federation noted that the
government had to rely on the Exxon Corp. to put up $15 million for
the assessment of damages from its Valez oil tanker spill March 24
in Prince William Sound.
   ``This lack of money can lead to a subtle blackmail problem,''
he said. ``... Because Exxon is paying, it likely will argue that
it should have a lot to say about how the damages are calculated.''

   The weekly Battle Mountain Bugle is
being sold this week to brothel owner Chuck Barrett, editor and
co-owner Linda Robertson said Thursday.
   Mrs. Robertson, who with her husband, Dayle, ran the paper for
the past four years, said Barrett had offered to buy the Bugle
after it was offered for sale nearly a year ago. Other offers were
made but weren't pursued.
   ``The fact that he owns a brothel disturbs us somewhat, because
we aren't in favor of brothels,'' Mrs. Robertson said. ``But nobody
else wanted to buy it. I haven't been in the best of health, and we
wanted to bail out.''
   The cost of the paper, with a circulation of about 1,850, wasn't
disclosed.
   Barrett plans to hire Jerry Teague as editor. Teague formerly
ran the Humboldt Sun and ``he's the same person I would have
hired,'' Mrs. Robertson said.
   Barrett owns several businesses in this northern Nevada town,
including the Calico Club and Desert Club brothels, a bookstore and
dress shop, and T-shirt print shop.
   Bordellos are legal in Nevada, under county option. The state's
largest counties, Clark and Washoe, ban brothels, but many of the
outlying counties permit them. Las Vegas is in Clark County and
Reno is in Washoe.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev was overwhelmingly elected
president today by the country's new congress, winning more than 95
percent of the vote.
   The sole candidate, Gorbachev received 2,123 of the 2,210 votes
cast, Yuri A. Osipyan, chairman of the commission that counted the
ballots, reported during nationally televised proceedings of
Congress of People's Deputies. Eighty-seven deputies voted against
the Communist Party chief, Osipyan said.
   Gorbachev, who was unanimously elected president on Oct. 1 by
the Supreme Soviet, replacing Andrei A. Gromyko, secured 95.6
percent of the votes cast by deputies in today's secret balloting,
Osipyan said.
   Earlier today the congress, the first competitively elected
Soviet parliament, nominated Gorbachev as the sole candidate after
rejecting demands he first report on his accomplishments and
failures.
   Maverick communist Boris N. Yeltsin withdrew his nomination bid.
   A little-known Leningrad deputy, Alexander Obolensky, offered
himself as an alternative to Gorbachev, but two-thirds of the
2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies rejected him.
   Obolensky, who is not a member of the ruling Communist Party,
said he knew he had little chance of winning the nomination but
wanted to ``set a precedent of an alternative.''
   Yeltsin, whose anti-etablishment campaign garnered 90 percent of
the vote in an election in Moscow, took himself out of the running,
saying simply ``I'm withdrawing myself.'' He said as a member of
the party's Central Committtee he was bound by the committee's
decision to support Gorbachev's election.
   Before the vote, human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said
he would not take part in the secret balloting for the presidency.
   ``We can't let these elections just be a formality,'' the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize winner said. Sakharov was one of four deputies
who abstained when the congress voted to place Gorbachev's name on
the ballot.
   Noone voted against Gorbachev's nomination.
   Estonian activist Marju Lauristen offered Gorbachev her vote on
condition he answer some tough questions first. For instance, she
wanted to know who in the ruling Politburo knew of plans to use
troops to break up a pro-independence demonstration in Soviet
Georgia, and how soon Gorbachev learned of the plans.
   Nineteen people died in the ensuing clash.
   Others demanded explanations of privileges enjoyed by Soviet
leaders and of a decree banning statements that discredit
authorities.
   As the inaugural session opened, the congress immediately
plunged into spirited debate over its agenda and powers. The lack
of parliamentary experience showed.
   Gorbachev led the proceedings, sitting behind two microphones
with a giant statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at his back. He
arbitrarily called for votes on some procedural issues while
ignoring others. Only a few deputies objected.
   At one point, the Soviet president took the microphone for 20
minutes, and in one of his most impassioned political speeches,
pledged not to abuse power if re-elected.
   Gorbachev vowed ``to pursue the line of democracy until the very
end so that what has happened in this country will never again be
repeated.'' His remark was an obvious reference to past
authoritarian Soviet regimes.
   One of the first deputies to take the floor was Sakharov, who
was banished from Moscow until December 1986 for human rights
activities.
   Sakharov praised Gorbachev for changing the face of Soviet
society and said he should be re-elected president but demanded
that Gorbachev first give congress an account of the mistakes and
achievements of his reform efforts.
   Sakharov also argued for changing the agenda of the congress,
chosen in the country's first contested elections in seven decades.
He said the congress should act as the nation's principal
law-making body. That is supposed to be the job of a new 542-member
Supreme Soviet being elected by the congress.
   Gorbachev cut Sakharov off after five minutes, set a time limit
on subsequent speakers, and moved to end debate on the agenda.
   The agenda was adopted by a wide margin. However, in a country
where legislative proceedings traditionally have been by unanimous
consent, there were 379 votes against the agenda and nine
abstentions.
   Not all parliamentarians were happy with the morning session.
   ``It's not at all democratic,'' said Egidijus Klumbys, a member
of the Lithuanian reform group Sajudis. Klumbys said he doubted
other sessions would be different.
   At least 80 percent of the deputies are Communist Party members,
but a small band of reformers assured the congress will differ
sharply from the docile, rubber-stamp assemblies of the past.
   Formally, the congress has little power other than to elect the
president and members of the Supreme Soviet and review the
president's appointments for top government posts.
   Two-thirds of the delegates were chosen by voters and the rest
were chosen by official organizations.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet neurosurgeon who was gassed during an
ethnic protest in Soviet Georgia has helped American doctors
identify the poison as a World War I-era field gas named
chloropicrin, the doctors said Thursday.
   ``He gave us an exquisitely detailed account of the symptoms,''
said Dr. Barry H. Rumack, director of the Rocky Mountain Poison
Center in Denver. ``They couldn't have gassed a better guy _ at
least in terms of getting complete neurological findings.''
   Soviet officials have said Red Army troops used two chemical
agents, the tear gasses CN and CS, to disperse a crowd of 8,000 to
10,000 people demonstrating April 9 in the Georgian capital of
Tbilisi.
   But because more than 350 people were hospitalized and at least
20 died during and after the protest, Georgian officials have
charged for weeks that something more potent than tear gas must
have been sprayed.
   Rumack was one of three medical experts sent by Physicians for
Human Rights, a 1,300-member group based in the Boston area, to
investigate those charges. The American doctors spent May 17-22 in
Tbilisi at the invitation of Georgian health officials and Andrei
Sakharov, the Soviet physicist and human rights activist.
   After interviewing dozens of doctors and patients, examining
videotapes of the protest and analyzing some gas canisters
allegedly used by Soviet troops, the American team is ``99 percent
certain'' that chloropicrin was used, Rumack said.
   The chemical, also known as nitrochloroform, was first used on
humans on a World War I battlefield in 1916. It causes potentially
lethal chest irritation and pulmonary edema, or fluid leakage into
the lungs.
   Until the 1960s, chloropicrin occasionally was used for civilian
crowd control in the United States, but is now banned because of
its toxicity. It can be used legally in the United States only by
licensed applicators as a fumigant against insects, Rumack said.
   The strongest evidence that it was used in Georgia, he said, was
the patients' symptoms, including burns in their mouths and
throats, and a molecular analysis of a gas canister by a highly
accurate technique known as gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy.
   Rumack said he watched as Soviet laboratory technicians analyzed
the canister and came up with results ``consistent with
chloropicrin.''
   He also said some of the symptoms, such as dry mouths and
dilated pupils, could not have resulted from tear gas or most nerve
gasses, but would be expected with chloropicrin.
   Citing the possibility of retribution against the neurosurgeon
who helped describe his own and other people's symptoms, Rumack
declined to name him.
   Besides Rumack, who is a professor of toxicology at the
University of Colorado Medical Center in Denver, the members of the
American delegation were Dr. Jennifer Leaning, chief of emergency
services for the Harvard Community Health Plan in Cambridge, and
Dr. Ruth A. Barron, a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont.
   Rumack said he believed four demonstrators died instantly when
they were sprayed directly in the face with an aerosol propellant
used with tear gas. He said neither tear gas nor chloropicrin alone
would account for such rapid deaths.
   How many later died from chloropicrin is uncertain, because
autopsy reports were impounded by the military and more than a
month has gone by, he said.

   One side was given a Chevy and the other received
a pair of hunting guns, and an agreement was signed Thursday
settling a name dispute between General Motors Corp. and a famous
Italian weapons maker.
   GM Chairman Roger Smith and Pier Giuseppe Beretta, chairman of
Fabbrica D'Armi Pietro Beretta S.p.A., exchanged the products
during a ceremony in Italy putting to rest a suit brought nearly a
year ago, the company announced.
   Beretta, a 463-year-old gunmaker, sued GM in federal court in
New York last July over GM's use of the name Beretta for a midsize
Chevrolet introduced in 1987.
   The settlement called for a $500,000 donation by GM to the
Beretta Foundation for Cancer Research and Treatment in return for
permission to use the name Beretta for the line of cars.
   Smith presented Beretta with a Chevrolet Beretta GTU Coupe,
which carries a base price of $15,610.
   In return, Beretta gave Smith, an avid hunter, a rifle and a
shotgun. The statement didn't say how much the weapons were worth.

<HEAD>Shuttle Engine Test Shuts Itself Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A test firing of a modified space
shuttle rocket engine aborted automatically after 2.5 seconds when
instruments detected excessive vibration, the Marshall Space Flight
Center said Thursday,
   But spokesman Jim Sahli said Wednesday's test, scheduled to last
2{ minutes, was not a failure because it can still provide
information about the engine's operation.
   Sahli said engineers attempting Thursday to trace the cause of
the abort, which could be related to a test detonation of an
explosive within the engine's combustion chamger.
   The cut-off occurred a fraction of a second after engineers were
to detonate explosives inside the combustion chamber of the engine,
which was mounted in a 300-foot-high rocket test stand.
   John McCarty, head of Marshall's Propulsion Laboratory, said the
explosives and a second device that may not have detonated were
placed inside the engine to show how engine systems perform during
unexpected occurrences.
   Steve Richards, McCarty's technical assistant, said the
explosive device could have caused systems to sense changes and
shut down the engine.
   Sahli said the test was part of a five-year program aimed at
developing a ``better, more efficient and better performing''
engine. He said it was a ``technology development'' test and not a
flight test.
   Wednesday's test firing was the seventh since the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration began the program at Marshall
in October.
   Sahli said the test would be rescheduled in about three weeks.
   Marshall is responsible for shuttle main engines, booster
rockets and external fuel tanks.

   The lessening of military tension between East
and West could lead to lower defense budgets and free resources to
preserve the environment, said a study released Thursday by the
Worldwatch Institute.
   ``I think that everyone realizes that one era is coming to a
close,'' Worldwatch director Lester R. Brown told a news
conference. ``No one is quite sure what the next era will look
like.''
   The study, ``National Security: The Economic and Environmental
Dimensions,'' forecast that as the superpowers decrease military
spending, they will devote more resources to solving ecological
problems of their own and of poorer countries.
   ``Both the United States and the Soviet Union have pursued an
elusive military superiority at the cost of their international
ecomomic standing,'' said Michael Renner, author of the report.
   But, he said, ``if eiher side claims to have won the Cold War,
it is surely a pyrrhic victory.''
   ``Japan is probably the real winner of the arms race,'' Renner
told the news conference at Worldwatch offices. Worldwatch is a
non-profit research group.
   Already nations have devoted increasing attention, if not
resources, to environmental protection, forming ``environmental
alliances'' to combat such problems as pollution of the Baltic Sea
and the depletion of the ozone layer, the report said.
   ``Environmental alliances are already beginning to cut across
military alliances,'' said Renner, noting that the nations
cooperating to curb pollution in Baltic Sea include members of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact: Denmark,
East and West Germany, Poland the Soviet Union.
   In another instance cited by Renner, ``West Germany agreed to
pay for sulphur dioxide scrubbers on Czechoslovakian power plants
in an effort to reduce the air pollution wafting across the border,
and will probably assist East Germany in the same manner.''
   Many of the ``environmental alliances'' involve
government-to-government contacts, said the report, but citizens'
groups are already beginning to cooperate.
   ``Environmental links across the East-West divide on the
grass-roots level are still in their infancy. But (environmental
groups such as) Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, among others,
are busy building contacts with the nascent Eastern European and
Soviet environmental movements,'' it said.
   Brown acknowledged that many Soviet citizen environmental groups
were also active in national front movements that seek greater
independence for the Soviet Baltic republics of Lithuanian, Latvia,
and Estonia.
   Western groups, said Brown, were avoiding contact with the
Baltic movements to avoid infringing on what the Kremlin might view
as a national security risk.
   Another Worldwatch report issued earlier this year, ``Action at
the Grassroots,'' said that ``in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe, where officially sanctioned local organizations are
numerous but largely controlled by state and party hierarchies, the
political openness of this decade has brought the genesis, often at
great risk to the founders, of independent citizens groups.''

   Frederic Remington's 1902 bronze ``Coming
Through the Rye,'' depicting four cowboys firing pistols into the
air at full gallop, was sold at auction Thursday for $4.4 million,
a world record price for a piece of American sculpture.
   The piece was bought by an anonymous telephone buyer, said Dana
Micucci, a spokesman for Christie's auction house in Manhattan.
   The work was part of a group of important American paintings,
drawings and sculptures of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.
   The statue, a first cast, is one of Remington's most recognized
works. The turn-of-the-century sculptor and painter was known for
works which captured the spirit of the American West.
   Christie's had estimated the piece would sell for $2 million to
$3 million. The record price includes the auction house's 10
percent buyer's premium.
   The previous world record for a piece of American sculpture was
Elie Nadelman's ``Tango,'' which sold for $2.86 million at
Christie's New York in December 1987, said Micucci. That piece was
painted cherrywood of a couple dancing.
   The previous high price for a Remington was $715,000 for
``Norther,'' which was sold in New York in 1982.

   Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone denied
involvement in the Recruit bribery scandal in long-awaited
testimony before Parliament on Thursday, but he admitted he
received donations from the company.
   ``I am totally innocent,'' Nakasone said under oath before the
Budget Committee of the House of Representatives. ``I regret such a
scandal occurred when I was the head of the government. I deeply
apologize for causing distrust in politics.''
   But Nakasone acknowledged publicly for the first time that since
1982 he received a total of $322,000 in political donations from
Recruit Co., an information and publishing conglomerate.
   People nationwide turned on their television sets for Nakasone's
testimony, which was broadcast live.
   Officials of the governing Liberal Democratic Party said the
three hours of questioning proved Nakasone's innocence in the
financial scandal, which occurred during his 1982-87 administration.
   But opposition leaders said he dodged crucial questions. They
demanded he testify a second time before Parliament's upper house.
   Meanwhile, members of the governing party's Executive Council
were to meet Friday in their continuing search for a successor to
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.
   The Liberal Democrats have been unable to replace Takeshita, who
announced last month he would resign in face of widespread distrust
in the party and government after the Recruit scandal. Most senior
party officials have admitted receiving money or stock from the
company.
   Nakasone said contributions he received from Recruit were
reported to the government as stipulated by law, but suggested that
some donations may have been divided among several support groups
to remain below the minimum reporting amount.
   Nakasone, 70, is the first politician called to testify under
oath in Parliament in the scandal. He had refused earlier
opposition demands to testify, leading to a three-month opposition
boycott of debate on the fiscal 1989 budget.
   ``I refused to testify earlier because I have never done
anything wrong,'' Nakasone said Thursday.
   After the session, a visibly relieved Nakasone told reporters:
``Facts are facts. They always prevail.''
   But opposition leaders said they doubted his testimony.
   ``I regret his testimony was filled with lies,'' said Tsuruo
Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the Japan Socialist Party, the
largest opposition group. ``It amounted to a defense of his seat in
Parliament.''
   In the scandal, Recruit sold highly discounted, unlisted stock
to about 160 influential people, including 17 politicians or their
aides. Many recipients sold the stock after it was publicly listed
and rose quickly in value, reaping large profits.
   Eleven of the politicians were members of Nakasone's Cabinet,
and opposition parties have charged that he was at the center of
the scandal.
   Nakasone has acknowledged that three aides bought a total of
29,000 Recruit shares, the largest amount of any politician. He
testified Thursday that they made a profit of about $450,000 and
used the money for entertaining political associates.
   In his testimony, Nakasone also denied any involvement in the
resale of two U.S.-made Cray supercomputers to Recruit by Japan's
semi-private telecommunications giant, Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone.
   Former company chairman Hisashi Shinto is among 16 bureaucrats,
businessmen and politicians arrested or charged in the scandal.
Prosecutors have said he assigned preferential treatment to Recruit
in return for stock.
   Prosecutors on Monday lodged bribery charges against two
politicians _ Nakasone's chief Cabinet secretary and the former
secretary general of the opposition Komeito.
   The scandal has caused the resignation of three Cabinet members
in addition to Prime Minister Takeshita and led to a sharp drop in
public support for the Liberal Democrats.

   Consumer food prices are rising faster than
predicted a few months ago and may gain an average of 5 percent to
7 percent over the entire year, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   That would compare with a 1988 average gain of 4.1 percent and
would be the sharpest 12-month increase since 1981, when retail
food prices rose 7.9 percent.
   ``Consumer demand will pull up food prices in 1989,'' the
department's Economic Research Service said. ``While growth in the
general economy is slowing, growth in real disposable personal
income is still likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent this year,
after rising 2.9 percent last year.''
   The report said that the Labor Department's consumer price index
for food increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent in the first
three months of 1989, well above the rate expected last fall.
   ``Additional upward adjustments are likely for the rest of this
year, based primarily on the strength of consumer demand and the
impact of higher petroleum prices,'' the report said.
   Much of the sharp rise in the first quarter was blamed on cold
weather in Mexico, Florida and California which cut supplies of
fresh vegetables. Retail prices, which had been expected to decline
during the quarter, rose an average of 5.7 percent.
   Other price increases in the first quarter resulted from
lingering effects of last summer's drought.
   ``Processed vegetable prices continued to rise because of
smaller supplies of canned sweet corn, green peas, snap beans and
dry beans, all victims of the drought,'' the report said. ``Smaller
supplies of canned vegetables forced frozen vegetable prices higher
as well.''
   Another first-quarter factor was retail egg prices, up 29.5
percent from a year earlier. Production was cut back because of
high, drought-related feed costs, the report said.
   Food price increases are expected to be more moderate in the
remainder of 1989. Prices for meats, poultry and fish ``will remain
reasonably stable for the rest of the year,'' the report said. Egg
prices are expected to fluctuate but should remain well above
year-earlier levels.
   Retail prices of fresh vegetables, following a normal pattern,
will decline this spring and summer from the first quarter's high
marks, and then ease up again in the fourth quarter.
   Prices of cereals and bakery products, fats and oils, and other
prepared foods were forecast to rise at ``a modest but steady'' 1
percent to 3 percent annual rate per quarter through 1989.

<TEXT>
   W. Gaston Caperton Jr., the father of
Gov. Gaston Caperton and a co-founder of a small insurance company
his son made a giant, died Thursday from complications from a
stroke. He was 83.
   He had suffered a stroke May 2 and had remained hospitalized
since. He died shortly after 12:30 a.m. Thursday at the Charleston
Area Medical Center.
   ``My father was truly a great man. His love for God, his family
and his state was greater than that of any man I have ever known,''
the governor said. ``He was a successful businessman and civic
leader who will be greatly missed by all who knew him.''
   The elder Caperton was born William Gaston Caperton Jr. in
Wright.
   In 1936, he helped found McDonough-Caperton-Shepherd-Goldsmith,
a general insurance agency, in Charleston. McDonough was Caperton's
brother-in-law.
   In 1964, Caperton was Hulett Smith's campaign director in
Smith's successful bid for governor. He also was a member of the
committee on export expansion for the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   His son, West Virginia's future governor, began working for the
firm in 1963. In 1970, the younger Caperton bought out his father
and uncle when the insurance group had just 13 employees.
   At the time his son became governor, the firm had more than 500
employees and 19 offices and was one of the top 20 insurance
brokers in the nation.
   His son was a political novice when he upset incumbent Gov. Arch
Moore in the November 1988 general election. He took office in
January and placed the insurance company in a blind trust.
   Caperton Jr. is survived by his wife, Eliza Ambler Caperton; his
son, the governor; a daughter, Cary Caperton Owen of Asheville,
N.C.; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled Friday at St. John's Episcopal Church in
Charleston.

<HEAD>ICC Chairman Resigns in Face of Senate Fight</HEAD>

   Heather J. Gradison resigned Thursday as
chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission rather than face a
tough re-confirmation fight in the Senate.
   ``The White House and I have concluded it was not in our
interest to fight the Senate Commerce Committee,'' said Mrs.
Gradison, a member of the commission since 1982 and its chairman
since December 1985. She said she will leave when a successor is
confirmed.
   The White House did not respond immediately to a request for
comment.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Neb., a member of the committee, said Mrs.
Gradison, wife of Rep. Willis D. Gradison Jr., R-Ohio, probably
would not have been reconfirmed.
   ``Most of the Democrats and most of the Republicans on the
Commerce Committee had the feeling that she had not during her term
followed the intent of the Railroad Deregulation Act,'' said Exon,
reached in Nebraska. Asked whether he would have voted for
reconfirmation, Exon said: ``I would not.''
   The senator called Mrs. Gradison ``a dedicated and talented
woman'' but said ``We felt that the president could select someone
that would be maybe a little more in tune with what the Congress
intended when they wrote that bill.''
   The act that freed railroads from government regulation had
provisions to protect the so-called ``captive shipper'' _ the coal
mine operator or wheat farmer who had only one a single source of
transportation available.
   Under the act, the ICC could hold hearings and bring pressure to
bear on railroads if it felt they were out of line, Exon said. ``We
felt that under Mrs. Gradison, the ICC did not perform as was
intended.''
   Mrs. Gradison, 36, had spent eight years in the railroad
industry with the Southern Railway System when she was appointed as
one of the five ICC commissioners by President Reagan. She is a
strong supporter of transportation deregulation and, said the ICC
in a news release, she ``firmly maintained throughout her tenure
that reduced governmental regulation encourages the development of
new and better ways for transportation companies to serve the
public.''
   Exon said, however, that she did little to help the captive
shipper.
   ``One of the classic cases in this regard was the Public Power
Company in Nebraska being charged exorbitant rates by the
railroad,'' he said. ``The company took it to the ICC which said it
couldn't or wouldn't do anything about it.''
   The case went to court, he said, and the railroad was ordered to
pay back a substantial amount of money.
   Mrs. Gradison announced her resignation to about 100 co-workers
in a brief and emotional speech.
   ``I think it's time to move on,'' said Mrs. Gradison.
   Her voice breaking, Mrs. Gradison said: ``I think the time has
come to take advantage of the free market opportunity I have talked
about and find some for myself.''

<HEAD>Owens: ``The Current System Is Completely Out of Whack''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Physicians and lawmakers urged Congress
Thursday to overhaul the system of Medicare payments that enables a
doctor in New York to receive $7,500 for triple-bypass surgery
while a Kansas colleague only gets $3,500.
   ``The current system is completely out of whack,'' Rep. Wayne
Owens, D-Utah, told the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on
health and the environment.
   Witnesses who testified before the House panel agreed that the
Medicare physician reimbursement system discriminates against
doctors practicing in rural areas, but they disagreed over ways to
eliminate the inequities.
   The focus of the debate were the recommendations of Physician
Payment Review Commission, an independent agency that monitors
Medicare payments and has proposed replacing the present system
with a Medicare fee schedule.
   Under the plan, developed by the Harvard School of Public Health
and outlined by commission chairman Dr. Philip R. Lee, the fee
would be based on a physician's work including his time, effort and
the skills needed to perform the task and the overhead cost of a
practice. A physician's cost-of-living expenses would not be
included in the fee schedule.
   The new formula would replace the current system in which
payments are based on ``customary, prevailing and reasonable'' fees
charged in an area.
   Dr. Robert Graham, executive vice president of the American
Academy of Family Physicians, argued that the cost of operating a
practice in rural areas is higher than the cost in a metropolitan
area.
   ``I support a plan for a single fee for single service
regardless of speciality or geographic area,'' Graham said.
   Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan., had told the panel earlier that
although rural physicians pay less for office space and salaries
for assistants, they usually treat a wide range of problems and
have more than one office.
   Slattery had raised the problem of vast discrepancies between
the reimbursement payments for doctors in metropolitan areas such
as New York City and Beverly Hills, Calif., and those in his home
state of Kansas.
   Specifically, he said physicians in all but two counties of
Kansas receive $49.68 for a limited consultation while general
practitioners in New York City receive $49.88 and specialists get
$117.59.
   He also cited the disparity between the payment for
triple-bypass surgery.
   The main point of contention, however, was the commission's
solution to the increasing cost of Medicare expenditures and the
rise in the number of unnecessary procedures.
   The panel proposed imposing expenditure targets which would
reflect ``increases in practice costs, growth and aging of the
enrollee population and a decision concerning the appropriate rate
of increase in volume of services per enrollee.''
   Tied to the targets would be an emphasis on common practice
guidelines for all physicians in the community.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., expressed reservations about
implementing the targets when adoption of practice guidelines may
take a few years to work out. But Lee said the targets should not
be delayed and the guidelines eventually will be set.
   ``That sounds a little like wishful thinking,'' Wyden said.
   Representatives from the American Medical Association, the
American Society for Internal Medicine and the American College of
Physicians complained about the expenditure targets, saying such a
plan would force physicians to ``ration'' services.
   ``Expenditure targets can only work if individual doctors
decline to provide certain services to their patients that they
otherwise would have provided,'' said Dr. Joseph F. Boyle,
executive vice president of the American Society of Internal
Medicine.
   ``It is also unclear how the medical profession can collectively
control utilization across the country in order to meet the
expenditure target,'' Boyle said.

<HEAD>Hundreds Attend Hearing on Nation's Health Care System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's health care system is
``expensive, bureaucratic and often cruel,'' an elderly woman told
more than 400 people at the first of several hearings by a
congressional commission.
   ``As one who has faced the problems associated with paying for
the acute care of my husband and the nursing home care for my
mother, I know first-hand the complexities and costs of our present
system,'' said Grace Nelson, 80, of Edina.
   Nelson represented the Minnesota Long Term Care Campaign, a
coalition of various community services organizations with chapters
in 26 states, as well as the Minnesota Senior Federation and the
Minnesota Health Care Coalition.
   Also testifying at the hearing conducted by the U.S. Bipartisan
Commission on Comprehensive Health Care was the Rev. Joseph Head, a
90-year-old World War I veteran from Minneapolis who uses a
wheelchair. His wife, he said, is bedridden and they cannot afford
outside help.
   ``We need help, long-term care for two patriots who have served
their country,'' Head testified.
   ``We love this country and have always done our part, but now we
are helpless and not getting all we need,'' said Head, a past
president of the National Chaplains of the Veterans of Foreign Wars.
   Nelson and Head were among more than 20 people who testified as
the 15-member commission began its public inquiry into how to help
Americans who lack health insurance and how to provide long-term
health care.
   U.S. Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., vice chairman of the
commission, told the hearing that action must be taken ``to avert
an impending catastrophe in the American health care system.''
   Noting that some people are unable to get the kind of care
readily available to others, he said, ``every American must have
membership in a health plan which provides financial access to
health care and manages the provision of all medical services.''
   The commission will submit its final report to Congress in
November after conducting six more hearings around the country. It
includes 12 congressmen and three White House appointees.
   Many of those testifying were in tears.
   ``I've worked hard to make a good life for me and Jennifer,''
Sue Stevens of St. Louis Park said of her 12-year-old daughter. But
she said they are unable to obtain medical insurance for their
asthma and other allergies.
   ``I don't know how much longer I can go on each day wondering if
our health-care problems are going to drag us down,'' Stevens said.
   James Reinertsen, a rheumatologist and president of Park
Nicollet Medical Center where the hearing was held, suggested an
approach to the medical ``haves'' and ``have-nots.''
   The average American, he said, uses more services than necessary
to maintain good health. He called on the ``haves'' to give up
coverage of such procedures as baldness treatment, breast
reductions and wart removal so that the ``have-nots'' could receive
basic coverage.
   ``I believe that reduction in health-care costs for those
Americans who now enjoy overinsurance would be more than enough to
pay for the costs of those who now have no insurance,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Former Housing Secretary Samuel Pierce on
Thursday defended his handling of a subsidy program that an
auditors report said favored well-connected Republicans.
   Pierce said he did not suspend the program, as recommended by
the auditors, because he believed changes to the program had
alleviated many of its problems.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development program provided
indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned low-income
housing projects. Jack Kemp, the current housing secretary, last
month suspended awards under the program, pending further review.
   The HUD inspector general said his audit found a pattern during
the Reagan administration in which former department officials and
other Republicans received a large share of project awards either
as developers or as consultants to developers.
   Among those cited by the inspector general's report was former
Interior Secretary James Watt, who was reported receiving a
$300,000 consulting fee on a Maryland project.
   Pierce drew an angry response from Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,
when he told a House Government Operations subcommittee that the
auditor's report focused on Republicans and that he would like to
see ``how those affliated with the Democratic Party benefited from
this program.''
   ``I think what you were trying to do was deflect some of the
blame ... making irresponsible statements that you can't back up,''
said Frank.
   It was Pierce's first public response to the inspector general's
report, which claimed the program was riddled with ``favoritism''
and ``mismanagement.''
   Pierce, Reagan's sole black Cabinet member who remained at HUD
throughout the eight years of the administration, denied that
projects pushed by well-connected Republicans got any greater
consideration than others.
   Pierce said he had one meeting with Watt but ``no promises were
made to him.''
   He said he would have advised housing authorities and developers
who hired consultants that they were wasting their money.
   ``There are other ways of getting to the people at HUD,'' Pierce
said without elaborating.
   Pierce defended his decision not to carryout the inspector
general's recommendation to suspend the program awards.
   ``I did not cavalierly disregard it (the IG's recommendation),''
he said.
   ``The IG is not God,'' he added, defending his decision to give
a 3-member selection committee full discretion in selecting which
projects would be funded.
   The former housing secretary admitted he had final authority
over the committee's decisions although he ``automatically approved
every project selection made by the panel'' since he received no
complaints about the process.
   Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., reminded Pierce that Congress had
ordered HUD to considered funding requests from ``public housing
authorities'' not specific ``projects'' or ``developers.''

   Private exporters have sold China an

marketing year that will begin on June 1, the Agriculture
Department said Thursday.
   No selling prices or the names of the companies involved were
announced. Wheat sales to China in the current 1988-89 marketing
year total almost 8.3 million tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The 150,000 tons would be about 5.5 million bushels and,
at recent prices of about $4.03 per bushel, would have a farm value
of around $22 million.

   Farmers whose crops are lost to drought this
year would get relief from a bill passed Thursday by the House
Agriculture Committee.
   The original purpose of the legislation was to extend the 1988
drought relief emergency bill to cover winter wheat crops being
harvested this year.
   But the amendments offered by lawmakers from non-wheat states
that could also experience drought problems expanded the bill to
cover many more crops.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told the committee through
a letter that he would not recommend that President Bush sign the
bill unless it was ``budget neutral,'' applicable only to 1989
crops affected by drought and accompanied by a promise that
Congress would agree to use crop insurance as the sole vehicle for
disaster assistance after this year.
   ``I think we are in the ballpark,'' said Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, after the vote.
   He said the improvements to the crop insurance program would not
be ready in time for action on this bill, but the progress the
House is making should stand as an indication that continued
emergency relief like this legislation will not be necessary in the
future.
   ``The secretary is going to say, `how much does it (the bill)
cost?''' said John Campbell, deputy agriculture secretary in charge
of commodities. ``We have a lot of work to do in analyzing the
bill.''
   He praised the strict crop insurance component of the bill, but
noted that policy changes would have to be made in how crop
insurance works.
   The adminstration wants farmers to purchase crop insurance
rather than depending on the government to always bail them out
when bad weather causes crop failures. But farmers are unhappy with
the current crop insurance program and haven't been participating.
   The bill requires them to buy insurance for 1990 as a
qualification for getting relief for 1989.
   Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the subcommittee on
wheat, soybeans and feed grains, called the inclusion in the bill
of crops besides winter wheat a ``political accommodation'' to
lawmakers from other states.
   ``I think we can sell this program,'' said Glickman.
   De la Garza estimated that the bill would cost about $1 billion
in relief payments, which is close to the amount of money the
government has saved in assistance payments to wheat farmers.
   In other words, the drought caused a shortage in supply which
means higher prices and no need for government subsidies. The money
that had been set aside for the subsidies would be used to pay the
farmers who lost their crops to drought.
   That's why the lawmakers call the legislation budget neutral.
   Glickman said the money farmers would receive in relief,
however, is not as much as they would have gotten if they had had a
crop.
   ``It's about a third,'' he said.

   A federal judge considering whether to block
the largest demolition of public housing stepped over a pile of
trash and broken furniture Thursday as he toured a building that is
slated for dynamiting.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise passed through the
dim, graffiti-marred hallways in the Kretchmer Homes project to
gather background for the court case that is before him.
   ``I can visualize better what the plaintiffs are talking about
on paper,'' said the judge, who has been attempting to mediate the
dispute.
   The Kretchmer Homes complex was begun in 1953. But already,
vandalism and neglect have taken their toll, and the project is now
only about one-third occupied.
   In one vacant apartment, Debevoise stepped over a ripped
mattress and trash piled on the floor, passed tattered wallpaper
and gaping holes in the walls.
   He paused briefly at a large window in the eight-story building
to peer through dirty, broken panes of glass at a barren complex of
12 similar buildings across the dusty courtyard.
   Housing officials are seeking to demolish Kretchmer's 730 units
and more than 5,000 other government-built apartments elsewhere in
Newark, more public housing than any other city has demolished.
Fighting the proposal is a coalition of tenants and homeless
advocates.
   ``The whole silly notion of having these buildings torn down is
beyond me,'' said Modesto Hill, 22, who has lived in the Kretchmer
project for 19 years. He spoke Thursday as he and his mother
prepared to move to another apartment, while the judge toured
elsewhere in the building.
   The battle in this city, where one-third of the 316,000
residents receive public assistance, reflects a national trend by
housing authorities who say high-rise projects are unmanageable and
dangerous and should be replaced by townhouses and low-rise
buildings.
   ``High-rise housing in a lot of areas is a concept that just
doesn't work,'' said Bill Glavin, a spokesman for the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   The targeted projects in Newark are ``beyond redemption''
despite millions of dollars poured into them for renovation, sid
Pamela Goldstein, a spokeswoman for Mayor Sharpe James.
   ``When you pile people in degrading circumstances on top of one
another, it just doesn't lend itself to good living,'' she said.
   But activists contend that with thousands of people living on
the streets _ an estimated 16,000 homeless in Newark and up to 3
million nationwide _ demolition is folly.
   They urge other solutions: closer tenant management that might
cut down on vandalism, reconfiguration of apartments and hallways,
keeping families with children on lower floors, and renovation
through grants.
   ``Rather than try to solve the problems, they decided to
eliminate them,'' said Melville D. Miller Jr., president of Legal
Services of New Jersey and a signer of the court suit that
Debevoise is considering.
   The first major project to be razed was St. Louis' Pruitt-Igoe
complex, which were destroyed in the mid-1970s after only about 20
years of use. The site is still vacant.
   From 1982 to 1987, more than 12,500 of 1.4 million federally
funded apartments were dynamited, Glavin said. Just Wednesday, a
10-story building was demolished by the wrecking ball in
Providence, R.I., after attempts to bring it down with dynamite
failed.
   Similar actions are planned in Jacksonville, Fla; Bridgeport,
Conn.; Houston; and New Orleans. Friday marks the deadline for
housing authorities to submit requests for federal funds to replace
demolished apartments. Glavin said about 20 communities had
applied, but he could not identify them.
   The lawsuit before Debevoise names the Newark housing authority
and HUD, which itself has criticized the authority for
mismanagement.
   The Newark authority, eighth-largest in the nation, controls
13,000 apartments and has a waiting list of 10,000 families. Nearly
40 percent of the apartments are vacant _ including many of those
awaiting demolition. More than 800 units have already been razed.
   The authority plans to replace the high-rises eventually with
smaller, more manageable builings, and to combine subsidized and
market-rate homes. The suit alleges that those replacement plans
are inadequate, citing a 1988 federal law requiring each demolished
apartment to be replaced.
   Activists largely have been unsuccessful in legal challenges to
the demolition of deteriorating public housing elsewhere. But
Debevoise, who before he became a judge was the founder of the
state's first legal project for the poor, has tried to settle the
dispute here.
   The parties agreed to Debevoise's temporary ban on demolition,
and he took the unusual action of assigning a mediator to meet with
them, ordering weekly updates.
   ``I knew from the outset that this was a no-win situation in the
litigation context,'' he said.
   The temporary halting of demolition has not halted the city's
effort to relocate tenants from buildings that are on the
demolition list.
   Hill and his mother are among the lucky ones, because they are
being relocated to a modern, subsidized townhouse rather than
another high-rise that might also be targeted for destruction.
   As she packed belongings Thursday, she pointed out new cabinets
and fixtures in the kitchen she was leaving behind. The vandals,
she said, are ``going to come tonight to strip all this out of
here.''

<HEAD>EPA Sued Over Pesticides In Food</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two environmental groups joined the state of
California and the AFL-CIO on Thursday in suing the Environmental
Protection Agency for allegedly failing to protect consumers from
dangerous pesticides in food.
   The suit asks that the federal courts require the EPA to impose
more stringent regulations on cancer-causing chemicals in food,
especially in processed fruits and vegetables often consumed by
small children.
   Al Meyerhoff, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said the suit is aimed at forcing the EPA to be more
aggressive in prohibiting the use of pesticides on food and to ban
them altogether if they are found to cause cancer.
   Under current EPA procedures, the agency allows the use of some
older pesticides even though agency officials concede that if the
same chemicals were newly introduced they would not be approved
because of health concerns.
   The agency is in the midst of re-examining scores of older
pesticides using current health criteria, but that process could
take years.
   At the same time, the agency applies a ``negligible risk'' test
when determining whether a cancer-causing chemical should continue
to be used, banning it if the increased risk is one in one million.
The suit asks the court to direct the EPA to automatically take a
chemical off the market for food use if there is any proof it is
carcinogenic, no matter what the expected risk.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, Calif.,
accused the EPA of a ``consistent failure'' to carry out the
requirements of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which requires the
regulation of unsafe residues from pesticides on food products.
   The EPA had no comment on the suit.
   Jay Vroom, executive vice president of the National Agricultural
Chemicals Association, criticized the suit as ``a political move
for additional publicity to further confuse and confound the
public'' about the dangers of pesticides in food.
   The industry has consistently argued that the levels of
pesticides in food products is so low as to pose no health danger.
   In addition to the Natural Resources Defense Council, plaintiffs
in the lawsuit are Public Citizen, a private environmetnal and
consumer group in Washington, the state attorney general of
California and the AFL-CIO. The NRDC is a private, non-profit
environmental organization.
   The suit also charges the EPA with not requiring enough
information from processsed food manufacturers to determine residue
levels of many pesticides, including some that have been found to
cause cancer.
   ``The law requires EPA to identify cancer-causing pesticides in
processed foods ... By refusing to collect the data and to apply
the law, EPA jeopardizes the public health and violates the public
trust,'' said William Schultz, an attorney for Public Citizen, a
private environmental and consumer group.
   In addition to the suit, the plaintiffs filed a petition with
the EPA asking that seven cancer-causing pesticides immediately be
banned in processed foods. They argued such a ban is required under
a 1958 law, although the chemicals were in use prior to that.
   These pesticides have been found to have higher concentrations
of residues in processed foods than in raw agricultural products,
the petition maintains, and should be subject to a provision of the
1958 law that prohibits any levels of a carcinogenic pesticide in
certain foods.
   The EPA has said that the so-called Delaney clause in the 1958
law does not apply to pesticides that were approved for use prior
to the law's enactment even though latest tests showed them to be
carcinogenic. In such cases, the agency allowed if they are
perceived to pose merely a ``negligible risk.''
   The plaintiffs claim there are at leat 20 pesticides now allowed
by the EPA in processed foods despite links of various degrees to
cancer.

   South Korean authorities Thursday
ordered radical students to stop burning U.S. flags at
anti-American protests on college campuses and said those caught
would be punished.
   School officials were told to prevent students from defiling the
Stars and Stripes, education officials said. Offenders face
two-year jail terms under South Korean Law.
   On Monday, radical students began a week of anti-American
protests in Seoul and other cities. They have repeatedly burned
flags and effigies of Uncle Sam wearing the Stars and Stripes.
   Protests were to call for the withdrawal of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty.
Radicals and dissidents say the U.S. troops hamper unification with
communist North Korea.
   They also say the United States props up authoritarian rule in
South Korea.
   On Thursday, about 500 radical students calling for the
overthrow of President Roh Tae-woo battled riot police at Korea
University after an anti-government rally. Students hurled
firebombs and rocks and police responded in kind. There were no
reports of injuries or arrests.
   At Dankook University, about 200 students held a peaceful rally
to denounce Roh and the United States. Riot police surrounded the
school, but did not intervene.
   Meanwhile, police raided a gallery in downtown Seoul Thursday
and seized a large painting of the U.S. flag displayed on the floor
where it was walked upon by visitors. Students at four schools in
Seoul painted huge Stars and Stripes on campus roadways so
pedestrians and vehicles could walk or drive on them.
   Newspapers in Seoul Thursday carried critical commentaries and
editorials urging radical students to stop their harassment of a
friendly nation.
   ``Defaming a nation's flag is a deplorable act,'' the Foreign
Ministry said in a statement Monday.
   Korean government officials are concerned that anti-U.S.
sentiment may create an anti-Korean backlash in the United States,
South Korea's largest trade partner.
   The Korea Herald, an English-language newspaper in Seoul, said
in an editorial Thursday: ``That uncivilized outrage of soiling and
disgracing the flag of a nation is self-degrading and
self-defeating at the same time.''
   Most South Koreans support the presence of U.S. troops.
Officials have said American forces will remain as long as they are
wanted by the Seoul government. Radical students lack public
support because of their violent tactics and extreme views.
   Meanwhile, about 700 teachers nationwide took part in sit-ins
calling for better working conditions and trade unions. They were
protesting a government threat to bring criminal charges against 34
colleagues who were called in for questioning, sources said.

   Here is a look at some of the key players in the
first session of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies on
Thursday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MIKHAIL S. GORBACHEV _ Age 58, received a renewed stamp of
approval for his reform program and personal leadership, winning
95.6 percent of the vote in his bid for the presidency. But in
pre-election debates he was subjected to unprecedented questioning
from deputies who took him to task for his policies on ethnic
relations, party privileges and legal changes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ANDREI D. SAKHAROV _ Age 68, 1975 Nobel Peace laureate, was
exiled to the closed city of Gorky in January 1980 for speaking out
against the Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan. Gorbachev
allowed him to return to Moscow in December 1986, and he has since
become a vocal but not uncritical supporter of Gorbachev and a
rallying leader for the progressive faction among deputies.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   BORIS N. YELTSIN _ Age 58, was elected from Moscow with the
largest popular vote of any deputy. His outspoken criticism of
privileges for the elite and calls for more radical reform appeal
to many Soviets. But his bluntness cost him a Politburo seat and
his job as Moscow party chief in early 1988. He turned down a
nomination for president Thursday, but said he would not withdraw
from any more races.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ALEXANDER OBOLENSKY _ A middle-aged scientist at a polar
research institute in Leningrad, not a member of the Communist
Party. He declared himself Gorbachev's rival for the presidency,
saying he wanted history to record that there was an alternative
candidate. But he admitted he had no chance against Gorbachev, and
the Congress voted not to put his name on the ballot despite strong
applause for his pro-reform platform.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MARJU LAURISTIN _ A professor at the University of Tartu in the
tiny Baltic republic of Estonia and an outspoken leader of the
Estonian People's Front. She pushed Gorbachev for answers to
questions on nationalities-related and legal issues. Other
non-Russian deputies also brought before the Congress tensions in
Georgia, Azerbaijan and the restive Baltic republics.

   Ariel Sharon, Israel's most charismatic and
provocative politician, is leading a right-wing revolt against
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's peace plan and the government's
failure to put down the Palestinian uprising.
   ``We are very late. We wasted 18 months. But I think that the
first thing the Israeli government should deal with now is how to
restore law and order,'' said Sharon, the former defense minister
who was the architect of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982.
   Slamming Shamir's proposal to hold elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip, Sharon added that the perpetrators of
terror and violence would first have to be dead,deported or behind
bars.
   His message sparked applause and cries of ``Arik for defense
minister!'' from the nearly 100 Likud bloc central committee
members, members of Parliament and ex-army pals who crowded into
the living room of Sharon's heavily guarded apartment in the Moslem
quarter of the walled Old City.
   Sharon, the trade and industry minister, is holding a series of
meetings before a showdown with Shamir on the peace plan at a
meeting of the 3,000-member Likud central committee, tentatively
set for mid-June.
   Sharon's seven-point counterplan calls for the governnment to
give first priority to ending the intefadeh, or uprising, which has
claimed nearly 500 Palestinian and 22 Israeli lives.
   It also demand Jerusalem be excluded from any peace negotiations
and the 130 Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank and Gaza
officially be made part of Israeli territory.
   Shamir, 73, has threatened to resign if he doesn't win
endorsement for his peace strategy.
   It is uncertain if Sharon will succeed in galvanizing right-wing
support. But Israeli anger has been on the rise, evidenced by an
``anti-fada'' of Israeli stone-throwing attacks on Arab motorists
and vigilante raids by settlers on Arab villages.
   The rotund, white-haired Sharon listened, occasionally jotting
notes on the palm or back of his left hand, as supporters in his
living room aired their frustrations over the army's inability to
stop the uprising.
   One man said the uprising could have been stopped with single
machine gun if the army had killed 20 Palestinians after the first
riot broke out in December 1987. A man in a wheelchair said any
Palestinian who threw a stone should have his house torn down and
more serious offenders should be expelled.
   Yehoshua Saguy, former head of military intelligence and Likud
member of parliament, told the audience ``whoever doesn't act today
will have to act tomorrow because anarchy is taking over in the
streets.''
   Shamir, Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
the chief of staff, were attacked for being too soft on rioters.
   To many, Sharon is seen as the only Israeli leader who has the
daring to shrug off world criticism and get the job done.
   He is remembered as the can-do general who crushed a Palestinian
insurgency in Gaza in 1970 and the hero who ended the 1973
Arab-Israeli war with a daring strike across the Suez Canal that
encircled Egypt's Third Army.
   A survey of 1,206 Israelis by the independent Modiin Ezrachi
agency indicated Israelis believed he could do a better job ending
the uprising, than anyone else. For example, he got 44.4 percent
backing to 20.5 percent for Rabin, whose job it is to put down the
revolt. The remaining percentage was scattered.
   Sharon's critics, however, note his military record was blotted
by acts of harshness such as the reprisal raid on the Jordanian
town of Qibia in 1953 when his Unit 101 commandos blew up a row of
houses killing 69 men, women and children. Sharon contended he was
unaware the houses were occupied.
   Sharon was also forced to resign the defense minister's post in
1983 after a judicial commission found he was indirectly
responsible for the Sabra and Chatilla massacre of at least 800
Palestinians in Beirut. It said he failed to forsee the danger of
allowing Christian militiamen into the camps.
   Sharon, 61, with characteristic self-confidence, said in an
interview he was the man to end the Palestinian uprising just as he
did the 1970 Gaza revolt, when the army built wide roads through
the refugee camps, set up ambushes for guerrillas and resettled
several thousand Gazans in the Sinai Desert.
   ``In Gaza, it took us seven months, day and night, but the
government was determined then to bring and end to terror and
violence, and we did it,'' he said, adding that all that was needed
now was resolve.
   ``It's not that Israel does not have strength. Israel has
military strength and economic strength. The problem is the
weakness of the national will. But in my opinion, it's all still in
our hands,'' he said.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Predicts Normal Relations Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HANOI, Vietnam (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach said
Thursday he expects normal relations with the United States to be
achieved next year, after Vietnam ends its decade-old military
occupation of Cambodia.
   ``The United States has repeatedly stated that relations with
Vietnam would be normalized after complete withdrawal of Vietnamese
troops,'' he said. Hanoi has promised its soldiers will be out of
Cambodia by Sept. 30.
   ``I am of the opinion that the United States will keep the words
of a big country,'' Thach said in an interview with The Associated
Press. ``The sooner it is normalized, the better, and it is better
late than never.''
   Asked when, he said ``the middle course'' _ meaning a reasonable
guess _ would be next year.
   ``It is the end of the tunnel,'' he said of the Cambodian
conflict. ``Now we can get out of the tunnel.''
   Central to any peace agreement is Prince Norodom Sihanouk,
former ruler of Cambodia and now leader of the guerrilla alliance,
who has been negotiating with the Vietnam-sponsored government.
   Thach said Sihanouk often has changed his behavior and tactics,
but always had the same objective: to be head of state. Since the
pro-Vietnamese government now has offered him that post, the
foreign minister said, ``I don't think he will miss the
opportunity.''
   Washington has not recognized the communist government that has
ruled all of Vietnam since winning the war in April 1975. The
Carter administration came close to recognition in the 1970s, but
that fell apart when Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978.
   The United States, which supports the Cambodian resistance, has
said it will not consider ending its trade and aid embargo or
establishing relations until the last Vietnamese troops leave.
   Relations with the United States are essential if Vietnam is to
get the aid and investment necessary to develop its economy, one of
the world's poorest.
   Vietnam also has been pressing China to fulfill what Hanoi says
was its pledge to discuss restoring normal relations once Vietnam
began withdrawing from Cambodia. China supports the rebels and the
Soviet Union backs Vietnam.
   In recent years, the United States and Vietnam have made rapid
progress on humanitarian issues, including resettlement of refugees
and migrants to the United States and resolving the fates of
American soldiers still listed as missing in action.
   Private U.S. citizens also have increased their contacts with
Vietnam.
   Arnold Schecter, a leading American researcher, said Wednesday
the Vietnamese were allowing him to open an office in a Hanoi
medical school to study the health effects of Agent Orange, the
herbicide U.S. forces sprayed on Vietnam during the war.

<HEAD>Britain Expels Four Czechoslovaks, Soviets Say Journalists Spied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain expelled four Czechoslovak diplomats
Thursday, a week after ordering out 11 Soviets. Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher said the crackdown was vital ``regardless of the
effect upon our relations.''
   In Moscow, the KGB said it had evidence that three British
journalists expelled last week engaged in spying. It was the first
time the Soviets had published detailed accusations against the
three.
   The employers of the British journalists denied the charges, one
calling them ``part of the tit-for-tat going on at the moment.''
   The Foreign Office accused the four Czechoslovaks of
``activities incompatible with their status,'' diplomatic parlance
for spying, and said they must go within two weeks.
   Foreign Office political director Sir John Fretwell summoned
Czechoslovak Ambassador Jan Fidler and said Britain deeply
regretted that the Prague government ignored a warning to rein in
diplomats last September, when three others were expelled.
   In the House of Commons, Mrs. Thatcher brushed aside opposition
charges she is jeopardizing what had been Britain's best relations
with the Soviet Union since World War II.
   ``The action had to be taken, regardless of the effect upon our
relations,'' she said. ``The worst thing of all would have been to
say because we had better relations, we could ignore those
unacceptable activities.''
   She said such activities were uncovered ``both in the Soviet
Embassy _ we have to take action against them _ and also in the
Czech Embassy.''
   Fidler termed the British allegations ``totally unfounded.''
   An embassy spokeswoman, who demanded anonymity, said Fidler told
Fretwell the move undermined British-Czechoslovak relations and
``damages positive developments in Europe as well.''
   The Czechoslovaks ordered expelled were Jan Pavlicek, 39, third
secretary and press attache; Helena Krepelkova, 38, a second
secretary; Jan Sarkocy, 35, third secretary, and Rudolf
Kasparovsky, 35, technical adviser.
   The expulsions reflected a tough stance with communist countries
despite what Mrs. Thatcher has hailed as the ``end of the Cold
War'' as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pursues his reform
policies. Despite giving Gorbachev a warm welcome on a visit six
weeks ago, Britain has complained that Soviet agents continue
widespread espionage.
   Britain has also sought better relations with Czechoslovakia,
partly to get help in trying to make more detectable the
Czechoslovak-manufactured explosive Semtex used by the Irish
Republican Army and other militant groups.
   The Foreign Office said Fretwell made a point Thursday of
thanking Fidler for Czechoslovak cooperation over Semtex.
   Foreign Office officials said allegations against the expelled
Soviets and Czechoslovaks were not linked.
   The 11 Britons expelled from the Soviet Union included eight
diplomats and three journalists.
   In Moscow Thursday, KGB spokesman Vladimir Strunin told a news
conference that: ``Competent organs possess information that
testifies to the involvement of these journalists with British
intelligence services.''
   The journalists _ Jeremy Harris of the British Broadcasting
Corp., Ian Glover-James of Independent Television News and Angus
Roxburgh of The Sunday Times _ on Saturday were given 14 days to
leave the Soviet Union.
   Britain said the move was revenge for Britain's decision on
Friday to expel 11 London-based Soviets _ also eight diplomats and
three journalists _ accused of spying.
   The most serious accusation leveled was against Roxburgh. The
KGB accused him of trying to enlist a Soviet citizen to obtain
information on unspecified ``government installations.''
   It said Roxburgh gave the Soviet equipment for listening and
recording telephone conversations, and promised to pay a monetary
reward for information that was interesting. It also accused him of
violating regulations that restrict foreigners' travel in the
Soviet Union.
   Andrew Neil, editor of The Sunday Times, said the charges
announced earlier Thursday by the Soviet KGB were obviously part of
continuing inter-government reprisals.
   ``These allegations are clearly absurd and obviously part of the
tit-for-tat going on at the moment,'' Neil said. The BBC and
Independent Television News also denied the charges.

   The leader of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army is coming to the United States on his first official visit to
seek support for his organization's war against the U.S.-backed
government, an organizer said Thursday.
   John Garang will meet with members of Congress and journalists
during his three-day visit beginning June 6, said Roger Winter,
Director of the private non-profit United States Committee for
Refugees.
   He will also be granted meetings with State Department officials
if he asks, said an administration source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Garang is coming at the invitation of former President Jimmy
Carter, who has undertaken an attempt to advance negotiations
between the SPLA and the government in Khartoum, Winter said.
   Carter visited Sudan in April, meeting with government officials
and with Garang's lieutenants, but the SPLA chief was ``in the
bush'' at the time and did not meet with Carter, Winter said. He
will meet with him in Georgia before coming to Washington.
   Carter's mission had the blessing of the Bush administration,
which has made an end to the Sudanese civil war a priority item on
its foreign policy agenda.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen visited Khartoum
earlier this week for talks with the government on ending the war,
and he plans to meet too with representatives of the SPLA, said the
administration official.
   Cohen will also discuss the Sudan situation with his Soviet
counterpart in Rome this weekend, the official said.
   The SPLA began fighting in 1983, demanding greater autonomy for
the southern provinces which are populated mainly by Christians and
animists. The rebels and their supporters in the West accuse the
Moslem-dominated government of waging genocide against the
southerners by preventing food convoys from reaching them and by
attacking population centers controlled by the SPLA.
   In recent months, Garang's troops have scored successive
victories over government forces and consolidated their control of
the south.
   But in early May, Garang announced a unilateral one-month
cease-fire to assist a U.N.-sponsored relief program that is trying
to stockpile enough food to save some 100,000 Sudanese from
starving. Both sides have used food as a weapon in the war,
resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths.
   Garang, a U.S.-educated renegade army colonel, is seeking to
build up public opinion and official support in the United States
in the event that negotiations get underway with the U.S.-backed
government, Winter said.
   The government has shown some willingness to discuss a peace
proposal offered by the SPLA last year, but Moslem fundamentalists
have so far derailed the process.

<HEAD>Opposition Candidates Again Defy Ban on Demonstrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders toured a hospital
Thursday to the cheers of hundreds of patients, visitors and
employees and said they will keep fighting they until they win
recognition of having won the election.
   It was the fifth time the candidates defied a government ban on
demonstrations, which is in effect until a visiting Organization of
American States delegation turns in its report.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and his two
running mates told OAS delegates Wednesday that they won the May 7
election and want their victory recognized and Panama's ruler, Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted.
   ``The OAS can help in one of two ways, either by starting us on
the road to a negotiated solution or by establishing a strict
quarantine of the Noriega regime,'' said Ricardo Arias Calderon,
the candidate for first vice president.
   Arias Calderon said the candidates' campaign-style appearances
were meant as ``a message of faith in ourselves.''
   ``We're telling the government we will continue to fight,'' he
said.
   The OAS mission was sent to help fashion a solution to Panama's
political impasse following the vote. The delegation had no
meetings scheduled Thursday, a spokesman said.
   International observers say the Endara ticket won the
presidential vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the government nullified
the vote, claiming that foreign interference made an accurate vote
tally impossible.
   The OAS then condemned Noriega and called for a transfer of
power in Panama.
   Noriega's backers claimed their presidential candidate, Carlos
Duque, had been ahead by 2-1 when the election was voided.
   In his meeting with the OAS delegation Wednesday, Noriega blamed
Panama's crisis on a long history of U.S. intervention.
   In brief comments to reporters, Noriega warned it would be a
dangerous precedent for the OAS to do anything that would be
considered interference in another country's internal affairs.
   ``Today it's Panama, tomorrow it could be any other country,''
he said.
   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, a Noriega spokesman, said OAS delegates
raised the issue of Noriega's retirement during one meeting but
that officers said they were loyal to Noriega and the question
would be decided by the Defense Forces.
   Noriega holds power through his command of the Defense Forces,
which have remained faithful despite U.S. and opposition signals
that a coup would be welcome.
   In Thursday's visit to the public Social Security Hospital in
Panama City, the opposition candidates were greeted by chanting,
autograph-hunting crowds on every floor.
   Operating room staff members in green gowns, caps, masks and
gloves emerged briefly into a waiting room.
   ``I'm between operations, but I have to get back to work,'' said
one after joining a chant of ``Justice! Justice!.''
   ``That beautiful man kissed me,'' boasted one woman to friends
in a waiting room after she hugged Endara.
   A nurse who works in the hospital laboratory said conditions
have grown worse in the last few years.
   ``We have minimal supplies,'' she said. ``We have to get rid of
the corruption.''
   The first demonstrations against Noriega began in June 1987. He
was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug charges in February 1988, and
U.S. economic sanctions were imposed on the Panamanian government.
   Noriega denies the charges and called them part of a U.S. plot
to abrogate treaties under which Panama gains control of the Panama
Canal at the end of 1999.

   The sun warmed to the occasion Thursday,
powering the entries in the first American Tour de Sol, a race for
solar-powered cars from Vermont to Massachusetts.
   The trip, which takes four hours for internal combustion-engined
vehicles, will take these competitors four days.
   All five entries _ plus a pint-size speedster driven by a
preschooler _ had large panels of photovoltaic cells, which turn
sunlight into electricity to run electric motors and charge
batteries.
   The solar cars were running the route in four legs of several
hours each day, with overnight stops at Hanover, N.H., Concord,
N.H., and Lowell, Mass., before reaching the finish line, scheduled
Sunday at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge,
Mass.
   The MIT entry, Solectria V, easily won the first leg of the race
Thursday, covering the 59 miles from the Statehouse lawn in
Montpelier to the Dartmouth College Green in just under 1 hour, 40
minutes.
   The car entered by the New Hampshire Technical Institute from
Concord finished second, in 2:33:17, and the Dartmouth College
entry finished in about 3:01.
   The Worcester (Mass.) Polytechnic Institute team had what it
called last-minute bugs that caused it to take more than seven
hours to arrive at Dartmouth. And a unique, wedge-shaped vehicle
brought by a two-man team from Alabama broke down on the first leg
of the race.
   Participants said they hoped for Thursday's sunny weather to
continue through Sunday. Clouds could make it impossible to finish
the race in the four days allocated.
   Race organizer Jim Kirby, of the Brattleboro-based Northeast
Solar Energy Association, said the aim of the event is to promote
interest in and development of cleaner transportation technologies.
   ``Only a few years ago this would have been thought of as a
rather novel and bizarre event,'' said Gov. Madeleine Kunin, who
waved a flag to start the race Thursday morning.
   But with heightened concern over environmental damage caused by
cars, she said, the racers might be offering ``a preview of what
life will be like in a couple of years.''
   Costs of the solar-powered vehicles were said to range from
about $10,000 in materials ``plus labor'' for the New Hampshire
Technical Institute entry to $30,000 for the state-of-the-art model
from MIT.
   One of the MIT innovations is brakes that, when applied,
generate electricity to help recharge the batteries, said team
member Lee Weinstein of Lexington, Mass.
   The four school cars were of a basic streamlined design.
   The fifth car, an independent entry driven by Ed Passarini of
Tuscaloosa, Ala., was taller and roomier. ``This is the commuter,''
Passarini said. ``You can carry your groceries in this one.''
   And then there was the sixth vehicle in the race, the favorite
entry of many but sure not to finish, said the driver's mother.
   Four-year-old Ian Cotter of Waldoboro, Maine, showed off and
then took off down the road after the others in a solar-powered
mini-car, bearing a big number ``6,'' that his father designed and
built for him.
   Asked how fast it would go, Ian said, ``about five miles.''
   Organizers said it is the first race of its kind in the United
States, and was modeled on an event that has been held annually in
Switzerland since 1982.
   Kirby said some of the cars can top 70 mph, going downhill. He
said they can get about two hours of use for about eight hours of
the sun's recharging. ``That makes them ideal for commuting,'' he
said.
   Dartmouth driver Lara Horner and others said a key part of the
strategy is not to go too fast uphill. ``That really runs the
batteries down,'' she said.
   New Hampshire Tech driver Don King said one of the best features
of the cars is their novelty. ``It's really neat. People wave,
their jaws drop open.''
   He said he's never been stopped by police, ``but a couple of
times, they nearly snapped their necks when we went by.''

<TEXT>
   Two Mormon missionaries from Utah were
gunned down and killed in La Paz, and left-wing terrorists who
claimed reponsibiliity threatened a ``war to the death'' against
``Yankee invaders.''
   Todd Ray Wilson, of Wellington, and Jeffrey Brent Ball, from
Wanship, were returning to their home in a poor suburb late
Wednesday when unidentified men shot them with machine guns. One of
the victims died immediately, the other on the way to a hospital.
Both were 20 years old.
   The radical Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front claimed
responsibility shortly after the shootings. It is the same group
that last summer tried to kill former Secretary of State George
Shultz when he was visiting La Paz.
   ``The violation of our sovereignty cannot go unpunished,'' the
revolutionaries said in a statement. ``The Yankee invaders who come
to massacre our fellow farmers are warned. ... We the poor have no
other road than to rise up in arms.
   ``Our hatred is implacable and our war is to death.''
   The slain missionaries lived in a neighborhood around the corner
from a church that was seriously damaged by a bomb explosion last
year, local church president Stephen R. Wright said in an interview.
   Two other bombs have been planted in the past nine months, he
said. One dmaaged a church and another was discovered before it
exploded.
   ``We are being targeted unfairly and inappropriately as being
imperialists,'' Wright said. ``We have been targeted because we
have a high profile, our missionaries wear shirts and ties and we
have nice churches.''
   Police say they have no suspects in the killings or bombings.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Mark Jacobs said American officials will
work closely with Bolivian investigators.
   ``The U.S Embassy in La Paz deplores and condems the
assaassination of two American citizens in La Paz in an act that
can only be described as cold-blooded murder,'' Jacobs said.
   The slayings were the first politically motivated killings of
Mormon missionaries in memory, spokesman Don LeFevre said at the
church's headquarters in Salt Lake City.
   ``They have died as martyrs in the cause of the Lord. We extend
our love and sympathy to their families and pray that they may be
comforted and sustained in this hour of tragedy,'' the governing
First Presidency of the Mormon faith said in a statement.
   Wright said Ball and Wilson came to Bolivia voluntarily and at
their own expense nearly a year ago to preach the gospel and enrich
lives of Bolivians. There are about 40,000 Mormons in the country.
   ``I feel great sadness and anger at the loss of these fine young
men,'' Wright said.
   All young Mormon males are encouraged to serve two years as
missionaries. Older couples and women serve 18 months.
   Church officials said the an autopsy was conducted Thursday and
bodies of the missionaries would be flown to Utah this weekend.
   Last year, the terrorists claimed responsibility for a bomb that
exploded near vehicles carrying Shultz, his wife and delegates in
La Paz for talks with government officials. No one was injured in
the attack.

   Richard L. Armitage, a top Defense Department
official throughout the Reagan administration and tapped by
President Bush as the next secretary of the Army, has decided to
leave government service, the Pentagon said Thursday.
   Armitage, currently the assistant defense secretary for
international security affairs, ``has asked that the president
withdraw his name from consideration for Army secretary,'' said
Peter Williams, the Pentagon's chief spokesman.
   ``Mr. Armitage also has asked to be relieved of his (current)
duties ... effective June 5. Rich Armitage has been one of the
mainstays of the Department of Defense since 1981 ... he will be
greatly missed by his colleagues in the government.''
   Williams quoted Armitage as writing in his letter of resignation
that he could ``no longer accomodate the needs of my ever-growing
family with the time and travel demands of public service.''
   ``The Army needs full-time, dedicated leadership. I regret to
say that I find myself, at present, after over eight years of
80-hour work weeks, unable to face that challenge,'' Armitage wrote.
   Armitage has eight children and Williams said his ``family
priorities ... were certainly unassailable.''
   Bush told Armitage he was withdrawing the nomination with
regrets. ``Your years of work to build strong defenses for America
and its allies and friends around the world has earned the
gratitude of the nation. You have helped to renew the bonds of
America's alliances and bring freedom and democracy to people who
have never enjoyed them before,'' Bush wrote.
   Williams had no information on whether Armitage already had
found a new job in private industry. A secretary in Armitage's
office said he was unavailable for comment, and would not be in the
office the rest of the week.
   The 43-year-old Armitage early this year had been slated to
leave the Pentagon for an executive position at the State
Department. But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney prevailed on him to
stay with the promise of a higher, service secretary position.
   In his current job, Armitage played a major role in policymaking
in the Persian Gulf, in the ouster of Philippine leader Ferdinand
Marcos and in overseeing foreign military assistance programs.
   Williams said Thursday he had no information on whether Cheney
and President Bush had selected a replacement for the Army post.

   A federal appeals court upheld the right of a
profoundly retarded boy to be educated at public expense, and a
disability advocate said Thursday that the ruling lifts a threat to
special education.
   The ruling issued Wednesday by the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals here overturned a U.S. District Court ruling last July in
New Hampshire which said the boy was not entitled to publicly
financed educational services because he could not benefit from
them.
   The higher court ruled that the 1975 federal Education for All
Handicapped Children Act means what the title suggests: ``A school
district has a duty to provide an educational program to every
handicapped child in the district, regardless of the severity of
the handicap.''
   ``I feel it is a reaffirmation of what I thought was clear all
along _ that all handicapped students are entitled to an
education,'' said attorney Ronald Lospennato, who represented the
14-year-old boy identified only as Timothy W. and the Disabilities
Rights Center.
   But attorney Gerald Zelin, who represented the Rochester, N.H.,
school district, warned that the ruling could expose cities and
towns across the country to potentially unlimited costs for
programs that will have minimal impact.
   Zelin said the town might appeal the ruling to the U.S. Supreme
Court.
   ``The statute defines handicapped children as those who need or
require special education,'' Zelin said. ``The district argues that
a child who can't benefit cannot `need' or `require' it.''
   Nationwide, Zelin said, as many as 10 percent of all school-age
children qualify for special education, although most of them have
relatively mild disabilities and can be accommodated in mainstream
classrooms.
   For children with extraordinary or multiple handicaps, however,
the cost to local government can be high. Day programs can cost
$5,000 to $10,000 or more per year, and residential placements can
cost more than $50,000 a year.
   Zelin said Congress never appropriated more than about $300 a
year per pupil under the law, which covers young people from age 3
to age 21.
   ``If Tim were to remain in a day program at $10,000 to $20,000 a
year, that's not going to break Rochester's budget. It is on the
other hand, arguably, a waste of public resources. For $20,000 you
could hire another whole teacher,'' Zelin said.
   ``It's a real head-versus-heart case,'' Zelin said.
   The boy's attorney agreed that funding was an issue, but argued
that the law raises questions beyond the school district's budget.
   ``First of all, Timothy is clearly the type of kid where society
has some obligation,'' Lospennato said. ``He is going to be, or
could be, an extraordinary expense for anybody, one way or another.
If it isn't the school district, it's going to be some other social
service agency.''
   ``More than that, the failure to provide services will result in
more expense to taxpayers,'' he said, arguing that if the town had
paid for services beginning when Timothy was 3, he might not need
such expensive services now.
   The dispute began in 1978, when Timothy turned 3 and the town
rebuffed his family's request for an educational program. In 1984,
the case went to U.S. District Court in New Hampshire.
   In court hearings, the boy's mother and therapists testified
that Timothy could hear, see bright light and respond to music,
touching and talking. But, a developmental pediatrician testified
that Timothy ``did not have educational needs and could not benefit
from an education.''
   Rochester School Superintendent Raymond Yeagley said the
appellate court's ruling will force the school district to shift
resources from students who could benefit from education to those
who may not.
   ``School districts are getting to the point they are asked to do
everything and spend more on education services than education,''
said Gwendolyn Gregory, deputy general counsel of the National
School Boards Association in Washington, which filed a brief siding
with the town.

<HEAD>17 Felony Charges Filed Against Two `Super Cops'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY NEMEC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two members of an elite police crime-fighting unit
have been charged with 17 felony counts accusing them of perjury,
doctoring evidence and staging a crime to entrap habitual criminals.
   Larry Subia and Daril Cinquanta, members of the Police
Department's Career Criminal Unit, were charged Wednesday with
first-degree perjury, attempting to influence a public servant,
false reporting and tampering with physical evidence. They were
immediately suspended without pay.
   El Paso County District Attorney John Suthers and his chief
deputy, Robert Brown, serving as special prosecutors, filed the
charges in Denver and Arapahoe County courts following a two-week
investigation.
   ``This is something we don't like to see,'' said police
spokesman Bill Phillips. ``We're not in a position to break rules.
Obviously something was wrong, something was not monitored.''
   ``Any time you file charges against a public official, it's not
great,'' said Arapahoe County District Attorney Bob Gallagher.
``This is not a happy time. I do have faith in the criminal justice
system that everything comes out okay.''
   Questions about Denver's so-called ``super cops'' operation came
to light during an investigation of a burglary in the Arapahoe
County city of Littleton last June that was allegedly staged for
television.
   Cinquanta and Subia allegedly paid an informant to get John
LeFebre and Martha Bell to burglarize a Littleton residence. Police
and KMGH-TV of Denver were at the home when the burglary attempt
was made and officers arrested LeFebre and Ball.
   Englewood attorney Robert Ransome told prosecutors that LeFebre
and Ball had been recruited by police informant Pete Lopez, who
allegedly helped break into the home but was allowed to escape.
   After evidence surfaced that the burglary may have been set up
by Denver police, the Arapahoe County district attorney's office
dropped felony charges against LeFebre and Bell.
   The Denver charges stem from a robbery case a year ago in which
Subia and Cinquanta allegedly gave false testimony at pretrial
hearings.
   Roy Lee Tyler and Dale Robinson were convicted in the case. But
in March, Denver District Attorney Norm Early said the two would be
released because of the possibility that tainted testimony had been
given.
   Cinquanta's attorney expressed disappointment and surprise
Wednesday after his client and Subia were charged.
   ``We thought there might not be any charges filed at all,''
Robert Dill said. ``We've presented a lot of information and had
the expectation that would prove beyond a reasonable doubt'' the
officers' innocence.
   Dill said Cinquanta is ``sad and upset that he's been charged,
but he's confident he will be vindicated ... and I'm not just
saying that.''
   In Arapahoe County, Cinquanta is charged with one count of
attempting to influence a public servant and three counts of filing
false police reports. Subia is charged with one count of perjury,
one count of attempting to influence a public servant and one count
of filing a false report.
   In Denver County, Cinquanta faces two counts of perjury and five
counts of attempting to influence a public servant. Subia has been
charged with one count of perjury and two counts of attempting to
influence a public servant.

<TEXT>
   Lawmakers have struck a deal that saves the
state Agriculture Department from extinction, but strips the
embattled commissioner of his power over pesticide regulation,
officials said Thursday.
   Commissioner Jim Hightower had angered conservatives and
chemical interests with tough new pesticide rules his department
wrote and enforces. He upset others with his efforts to sell
hormone-free beef to Europe earlier this year.
   Republican Gov. Bill Clements, who has the power to veto the
Agriculture Department out of existence _ as some have urged _
promised to sign a compromise bill that would turn pesticide
regulation over to an independent board.
   ``It would mean a more reasoned, more effective, more consistent
and more coordinated enforcement of pesticide rules,'' Clements
said in a statement that never named Hightower, a Democrat and
self-described populist.
   Hightower's press secretary, Andy Welch, said the two-term
commissioner would wait until the Legislature finishes with the
bill before commenting.
   Under the compromise, a new nine-member Agricultural Resources
Protection Authority would set all policies and regulations on
pesticide use.
   The board would coordinate efforts of all state agencies,
including the Water Commission and Structural Pest Control Board,
which rule on pesticide use.
   The panel would be headed by the agriculture commissioner and
include officials from universities and state agencies. The
governor would appoint a consumer member and an agricultural
producer.
   The plan also requires that licensed pesticide applicators _
private farmers or commercial applicators _ ensure that their
employees are familiar with the pesticides they work with, said
Glenn Smith, an aide to Lt. Gov. Bill Hobby, who proposed the
provision.
   A key part of the deal says the new board can't weaken existing
rules, said State Rep. Lena Guerrero, a former farm worker.
   ``They are not allowed to change a law ... when the effect would
be less protective of the public's health, safety or welfare,'' she
said.
   Creation of the board appeared to be the best deal Hightower's
allies could get, Ms. Guerrero said.
   ``It's probably not the best way to set regulatory pesticide
policy in this state, but it's a legislative agreement,'' she said.
   Rep. Rick Perry, a Hightower opponent, called the plan the best
for all concerned.
   ``I've just got some problems with a single individual with
total control over the pesticide regulation in this state,'' Perry
said. ``I just think the board's a lot better way to go.''
   A coalition of 40 agricultural groups that have opposed
Hightower, including the Texas Farm Bureau and the Texas and
Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, called the board ``a small
step in the right direction.''
   Hightower's political problems mounted as the Legislature
considered the Agriculture Department sunset bill, legislation that
must be approved every 12 years to keep each state agency in
business.
   If the bill fails to pass _ or is vetoed by Clements _ the
department would cease to exist on Sept. 1, 1990. If Clements signs
the bill, the department would continue for another 12 years.
   The Texas Farm Bureau had urged lawmakers to abolish the elected
agriculture commissioner's post and replace it with an appointee.
   Clements says he only has the power to kill the department, and
doing so wouldn't eliminate the elected commissioner's post.
   Saving the department was a top goal, Ms. Guerrero said.
   ``I also wanted to make sure we maintained an elected
agriculture commissioner,'' she said. ``Everybody eats, and
everybody should have a right to elect their agriculture
commissioner.''

   Arab leaders continued arguing
heatedly Thursday about Lebanon, and differences over Syria's
military presence there threatened to wreck the summit and further
fragment the Arab world.
   Iraq is insisting on a total withdrawal of all 50,000 Syrian
troops in the war-plagued country. Syria, resisting pressure from
its traditional foe, is refusing to pull out even from Beirut,
where its soldiers and Christian Lebanese troops battled again
Thursday.
   Underscoring the general frustration, Kuwait resigned Thursday
from chairmanship of the league's six-nation committee on Lebanon.
   Behind closed doors, foreign ministers searched for a compromise
acceptable to Syria and Iraq, which is the only outspoken Arab
supporter of Lebanese Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
   Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz told reporters after a
five-hour session: ``We are still looking at the options. The main
one is for total Syrian withdrawal. If that is not achieved, there
cannot be a solution.''
   Aziz returned to the hotel lobby late in the evening to announce
that a Kuwaiti-Egyptian compromise solution was being submitted to
the summit for approval at a late night session.
   He gave no details of the compromise but said the Syrians
continued to block every compromise suggested on Lebanon.
   Unless there is a last-minute change, he said, ``I think the
situation is going to deteriorate very badly.''
   The summit had been delayed from closing Wednesday by the
quarrel over Lebanon.
   Syria, stressing its geographic proximity and historic links to
Lebanon, claimed its withdrawal would leave a security vacuum
facing Israel and fuel the 14-year civil war. Syrian troops have
been deployed there since 1976 under an an Arab League peacekeeping
mandate.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein argued at a late-night closed
summit session Wednesday that Syria no longer is a neutral mediator
in Lebanon because its troops are fighting alongside Moslems.
   Conference sources said Saddam also accused Syria of introducing
a new complication by allowing Iranian Revolutionary Guards into
Lebanon.
   The sources said most Arab countries agree on the need to
curtail, if not end, Syria's monopoly in Lebanese affairs.
   King Hussein of Jordan suggested compromising with a joint Arab
peace force but said Syria must have a role.
   ``It is high time for the Arabs to lift the heavy burden that
Syria and its forces in Lebanon ... have had to carry alone,'' he
said. But a solution would come ``only through a comprehensive Arab
effort in which Syria would have its role alongside its Arab
brethren.''
   But only Jordan openly has expressed willingness to send troops
to Lebanon, the sources said on condition of anonymity. Jordan's
delegation made available the text of Hussein's speech.
   He backed Iraqi demands that Iranian forces should be withdrawn.
About 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards deployed in Lebanon in
1982, ostensibly to help fight the invading Israeli army. It was
not clear if Hussein was suggesting that more Iranians lately have
entered Lebanon.
   The Jordanian leader also called for Israel's withdrawal from
its self-designated security zone in south Lebanon, carved out
after the 1982-1985 invasion, and suggested the U.N. Security
Council mediate.
   The Lebanon crisis and Palestinian issue have dominated a
conference convened primarily to reinstate Egypt in the Arab League
after 10 years of ostracism for signing peace with Israel.
   Conference sources said Syria has voiced reservations over
Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat's peace
moves, including his recognition of Israel.
   But the sources said the Syrians would not block a resolution
backing Arafat because they already are too isolated on the Lebanon
issue.

   Two Mormon missionaries killed in Bolivia
were part of a long tradition that sends thousands of young Mormons
into the far corners of the world to share their faith.
   Since The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was
founded in 1830, its members have been taught that the task of
reaping converts was a high and holy calling _ more important than
school, career or courtship.
   Todd Ray Wilson and Jeffrey Brent Ball, shot to death on their
way home in La Paz late Wednesday, were products of a missionary
zeal that has made Mormonism one of the world's fastest growing
religions.
   The radical Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front claimed
responsibility shortly after the shootings. It is the same group
that last summer tried to kill former Secretary of State George
Shultz when he was visiting La Paz.
   Ball, 20, of Wanship, Utah, left college and a girlfriend to
become a missionary.
   Wilson, 20, of Wellington, Utah, also forsook his studies and
worked at a restaurant to finance two years of missionary service.
He, too, had a girlfriend.
   Ball's older sister is serving a mission in Guatemala and in
both families brothers of the victims also are preparing for
missionary service.
   Among Mormons such sacrifices are not uncommon. Worldwide the
faith is served by about 36,000 volunteer missionaries who work
without salary. Most either pay their own way or are supported by
their families or local congregations.
   Each year, they bring about 200,000 converts to the 6.6
million-member church.
   All young men are urged to serve missions before marriage or
completing college. In recent years the church increasingly has
urged older couples and single young women to join the ranks.
   ``It's a scriptural mandate and early presidents of the church
and church leaders down through the years have emphasized that
mandate,'' said church spokesman Don LeFevre.
   The faith's founder, Joseph Smith, taught that all other
religions were false and told his followers to carry his message to
``every nation, kindred, tongue and people.''
   Proselytizing even reaches beyond the grave. Mormons conduct
proxy baptisms for non-Mormon ancestors in the hope they will
accept the faith in the hereafter.
   John Jaussi, former bishop of the Wanship congregation, said
that typically about five people from the mostly Mormon community
of 250 are serving missions at any given time.
   Currently, Wanship has a missionary in London and three just
returned from Argentina, North Carolina and Texas, he said.
   ``The average mission costs about $10,000, so it's quite a
sacrifice financially, but it's a sacrifice that's well worth it.
Families are quite happy to see their sons go out,'' he said.
   On Thursday, a new group of missionaries arrived at the church's
Missionary Training Center at Brigham Young University to study
doctrine and learn foreign languages before departing for their
assignments.
   Ed Pinegar, the center's director, declined to discuss the
shootings in Bolivia. He said through his secretary that the
trainees had not been informed of the tragedy, but would be told
later.
   During any given week, about 1,500 missionaries are at the
center, said LeFevre.

   A Mormon missionary who was a star athlete
and another who was an honor student enjoyed Bolivia, where their
young lives were cut short by men with machine guns, their fathers
said Thursday.
   Jeffrey Ball and Todd Wilson were shot to death as they entered
their apartment in a poor neighborhood in La Paz on Wednesday. The
leftist Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front claimed responsibility.
   Ball ``dearly loved it in Bolivia. Every letter we got was how
much he loved it there,'' said his tearful father, Brent.
   Arvil Wilson, a mine electrician in the coal-rich mountains near
his Wellington home, said his son wrote often, telling the family
how much he enjoyed the country and his prosyletizing.
   ``He loved the people,'' the elder Wilson said.
   Ball and Wilson, both 20, had been in Bolivia since last fall.
They were machine-gunned as they were entering their apartment in a
poor neighborhood. The leftist Zarate Willka Armed Liberation Front
claimed responsibility.
   ``Everyone's totally stunned,'' said Sandra Jaussi, a neighbor
of the Ball family in Wanship, about 65 miles east of Salt Lake
City.
   ``This is something we never would have imagined could happen to
one of our fine young men. We are so broken-hearted,'' she said.
   Her husband, John Jaussi, Ball's former bishop and high school
teacher, said the killings ``hit us particularly hard because it's
such a far-off place and it happened in such an unexpected manner.''
   At North Summit High School, Ball's ``whole dream was to play
football,'' said Earl Blonquist, his principal and coach.
   Ball, a stocky 200-pounder, played on the varsity as a freshman
and sophomore and was an all-state player his last two years. He
also was vice president of the student body.
   A knee injury in junior college put an end to football, the
coach said.
   ``His goal got changed,'' Blonquist said. ``He was a competitor.
I felt he was doing what he should have been doing.''
   Ball's sister, Wendy, is a missionary in the Guatemala-Guatemala
City North Mission.
   Arvil Wilson said his son was the seventh of 10 children and an
honors graduate of Carbon High. During his few quarters at the
College of Eastern Utah, he was the night manager of a restaurant
in nearby Price.
   However, unable to keep up the pace, he dropped out of school
and worked to save money for his mission.
   ``He was a very joyful kid, liked to kid around,'' the elder
Wilson said. ``He was good at what he did.''
   Another of his sons, Brad, is preparing to leave on a mission
this summer for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
   ``We're all very emotionally hurt,'' said Roger Branch,
president of the church's Wellington Stake. ``But we're all doing
fine, the family's doing fine. It hurts, but there is no anger, no
meanness.''

   When the new Soviet parliament opened Thursday,
the free debate that characterized the session took a little
getting used to.
   Vitaly Korotich, editor of the avant-garde weekly Ogonyok,
compared the session to ``dancing lessons for legless people.''
   ``We don't really know how to move in conditions of democracy,''
he said.
   At the start of the proceedings, the only leader on the stage
was a towering statue of Soviet founder and veritable Communist
saint Vladimir Lenin.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev was just another portly, balding party man
in the front row until he was elected temporary chairman and left
his fellow deputies to take charge of the Congress under Lenin's
watchful gaze.
   Then Gorbachev became puppetmaster, pulling strings to set the
session dancing to his desires.
   Dozens of deputies strode decisively to the one microphone in
the well to argue procedural points or offer frank criticism and
probing questions of Gorbachev and his government. Their colleagues
in the Kremlin's starkly modern glass-and-granite Palace of
Congresses laughed, booed, glowered and listened avidly _ an abrupt
contrast to the bored perusing of Pravda typical in the old
parliament.
   Defeat did not discourage the vanquished, so thrilled were they
to hear the debate.
   ``We've never had anything like this,'' said Alexander N. Kraiko
of Moscow, undeterred by his side's defeat in an attempt to hear
the candidates before voting on them.
   The vote on that proposal was overwhelming, with only 379 of the
2,250 deputies voting on Kraiko's side. But it was only last
October that the old Soviet parliament experienced its first ``no''
votes when 13 brave souls raised their hands to oppose a law on
using paramilitary troops against demonstrators. At the time,
colleagues gasped, smirked and pointed at the handful making a
historic break with decades of unanimity.
   ``Debates are going on,'' said Deputy Dmitri S. Likhachev on
Thursday. ``That's democracy.''
   Gorbachev displayed a surprising mastery of parliamentary
trickery. He ignored amendments he didn't like, ordering votes on
the original proposals instead. He gave early speakers five
minutes, later ones only 30 seconds.
   Vitas Tomkus, a Lithuanian delegate, observed that when
Gorbachev agreed with a suggestion, he genially asked for the
hall's opinion.
   ``He carries on like a god, permitting others to speak,'' Tomkus
said with reluctant admiration for the leader's skill. ``He's like
a great actor, attuned to the hall.''
   Outside the vast auditorium, reporters who in the past were
hemmed into a distant balcony and only occasionally released for
brief meetings with chosen delegates were stunned to find
themselves wandering about the lobby surrounded by hundreds of
deputies. Some journalists even bumped into members of the ruling
Politburo, who are almost never seen in public.
   In a hallway on the ground floor of the auditorium, masses of
chain-smokers reduced visibility to about 10 yards, but there was
no indication of politicking or caucusing in the room. It was
strictly for smoking.
   At the lunch break, Tomkus and several of his fellow Lithuanian
deputies relaxed in the Kremlin sunshine, cracking strained jokes
about the impossibility of winning approval for their radical
proposals for Baltic sovereignty. They looked thoroughly out of
place among deputies generally 25 years their senior.
   ``Look,'' Tomkus joked, pointing at some passing deputies
sporting distinctive felt caps that marked them as representatives
of conservative Central Asia. ``There are some more who won't vote
for us.''

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto has
removed the army intelligence chief who distributed millions of
dollars worth of U.S. military aid to Afghan guerrillas, officials
reported Thursday.
   Lt. Gen. Hamid Gul, director of Inter Services Intelligence, was
transferred to army headquarters in neighboring Rawalpindi and
replaced by retired Gen. Shamsur Rahman Kallu, a Defense Ministry
spokesman said privately. Gul distributed the aid to insurgent
groups based in Pakistan. Both Pakistan and the United States have
helped finance and supply guerrillas fighting the Soviet-supported
Afghan government.
   Moderate Afghan guerrilla organizations accused Gul of giving
most of the assistance to the Islamic fundamentalists Hezb-e-Islami
led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
   He also was believed to be behind the much-criticized attack by
guerrillas on Jalalabad, their first major assault after Soviet
troops withdrew Feb. 15 after nine years of involvemnt in the
Afghan civil war.
   Some insurgent leaders predicted the eastern city would fall
within a few days after the attack began March 6, but the battle
has been stalemated for weeks.
   The Afghan government welcomed the news about Gul. Foreign
Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said in Kabul: ``Maybe
Pakistan is not continuing to pursue a military option. ... This
may be a step toward a peaceful settlement with Pakistan.''
   Gul was appointed by President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, a general
who was killed in a plane crash last year that investigators
described as sabotage.
   Zia forced Kallu to retire after Kallu said he should step down
as army chief of staff while serving as president.
   Analysts said Gul's removal indicated Ms. Bhutto's growing
strength in Pakistan, the first Moslem nation in modern times to be
governed by a woman. In 1977, Zia overthrew her father, Prime
Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged two years later.

<HEAD>Tornado, Large Hail Batter Illinois And Missouri</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe thunderstorms rolled across the Midwest on Thursday with
high wind, a tornado, large hail and heavy rain.
   The storms, forming in unstable air along a cold front, spawned
a tornado near Vandalia, Ill., and dropped hail as big as baseballs
east of that city. The tornado damaged some trees.
   Parts of the Chicago area received more than an inch of rain
between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m., said National Weather Service
meteorologist Rich Brumer.
   ``This is the springtime weather which we should have got last
year when we had the drought,'' Brumer said. ``Farmers still need
more rain.''
   The night before, tornadoes flattened farmsteads and wrecked
mobile homes in Iowa and Wisconsin, and one person was killed.
Early Thursday, a tornado in northwestern Ohio damaged buildings in
one village and ripped the tops off trees, the weather service said.
   Hail more than 3 inches in diameter pelted areas near Dittmer
and Herculaneum, Mo. Hail as big as golf balls damaged cars in
northern Webster County, Mo., and broke windows and tore siding off
houses at Greenfield, Ill.
   Hail the size of golf balls also fell in Illinois at
Taylorville, Carrollton, Litchfield and Carlinville, and in
Missouri near St. Clair and at Marshall.
   Hail 1{ inches in diameter broke windows in Lafayette County,
Mo., and caused crop damage in Lafayette County, the weather
service said.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted to 58 mph at Jefferson City, Mo., and
to 60 mph at Midway, Mo.
   Wind overturned a mobile home with five people inside near
Mexico, Mo., but no one was injured, the weather service said.
   A storm that hit a campground at Springfield, Ill., damaged
seven trailers, including two that were overturned, and a 30-foot
recreational vehicle was moved 40 feet, officials said. Six people
suffered minor injuries.
   Elsewhere, snow showers tapered off over the mountains and
foothills of north-central Montana. Two to 3 inches of snow fell in
the Bearpaw Mountains of Montana.
   Temperatures across western and southern Texas climbed into the
90s and above 100 again, and San Antonio reached a record high of
97 degrees.
   By contrast, a freeze advisory was posted overnight for
southeastern Wyoming, where temperatures were expected to drop to
the 20s and 30s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 104 at Laredo,
Texas. Thursday's low for the 48 contiguous states was 19 degrees
at Truckee, Calif.
   For Friday, scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast
from the Texas Panhandle to Arkansas, the Ohio Valley, the central
Appalachians and New England. Scattered showers were forecast
across the Great Lakes and over the Pacific Northwest.
   Highs in the 50s were predicted from eastern North Dakota to
northern Minnesota; the 60s from the Pacific Northwest to the
northern and central Rockies, the northern Plains and upper
Michigan; the 90s from inland Southern California to southern New
Mexico, all of Texas except the Panhandle, much of the Gulf Coast,
Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast; above 100 degrees in the
desert Southwest and along the Rio Grande Valley of southwestern
Texas; and in the 70s or 80s over the rest of the nation.

   A military court acquitted four soldiers of
manslaughter Thursday in the beating death of a Palestinian because
medical evidence indicated he died of blows administered later by
other soldiers.
   All four were found guilty of brutality and will be sentenced
June 15.
   Arab hospital officials said Israeli soldiers in the occupied
Gaza Strip shot and killed an 18-year-old Palestinian and wounded
at least 35 people on Thursday, including a 6-year-old boy. Two
Palestinians were reported wounded in the West Bank.
   At least 498 Palestinans have been killed in the uprising
against Israeli occupation that began more than 17 months ago.
Twenty-two Israelis have been slain.
   The military court decided the case of four soldiers accused of
beating 42-year-old Hani Shami to death Aug. 22 after arresting him
during a roundup at the Jabaliya refugee camp in Gaza.
   Jabaliya is a squalid camp of 60,000 Palestinians just north of
Gaza City. The first riots of the uprising occurred there, on Dec.
8, 1987, and it is considered one of the Gaza Strip's most militant
areas.
   Col. Emanuel Gross, the presiding judge, said the soldiers beat
Shami indiscriminately in his home for about 15 minutes with rifle
butts and a broomstick. He said one defendant jumped from a bed
onto the victim's stomach.
   Medical evidence showed, however, that Shami died of a further
beating by other soldiers after he was taken to an army base, the
judge said, adding that the investigation was so poor that those
who dealt the fatal blows probably could not be identified or
disciplined.
   The trial was seen as a test of the army's willingness to punish
soldiers for brutality. The United States has criticized Israel for
either not bringing violators to trial or being too lenient with
penalties.
   Beatings became widespread after Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin
authorized soldiers in January 1988 to beat Palestinian rioters.
Commanders said many soldiers initially felt they were required to
break bones.
   Gross said officers in Jabaliya had ordered soldiers to beat
Palestinians in detention, in violation of written army orders. He
said the orders issued in Jabaliya were ``manifestly illegal'' and
the defendants should have refused to obey.
   ``The beating of someone who disturbs order, for the purpose of
deterrence, is not a military need; it is punishment,'' the judge
said.
   Army spokesmen refused comment on whether charges would be filed
against officers in Jabaliya who issued illegal orders.
   Military officials who testified at the trial acknowledged that
the orders on beating were ambiguous.
   When asked when beatings were permitted, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron,
the chief of staff, testified in March: ``You are asking me about
gray areas. ... Soldiers are told to use their own judgment _ how
severe a situation is and how much force is necessary.''
   Gross said the army should issue clear written orders on the use
of force.
   ``We must guard the rule of law, which is the basis for our
values as a civilized nation,'' he declared. ``The law must not be
harmed, despite the great distress faced by soldiers as they
perform their duties.''.
   The defendants _ 1st Sgt. Yitzhak Adler and Yitzhak Kibbudi,
Ariyeh Luchato and Pvt. Ron Hakhel, all privates _ could be given
up to three years in prison each for brutality. For manslaughter,
the maximum sentence is 20 years.
   On Thursday, soldiers in Jabaliya opened fire on stone-throwers,
fatally wounding Khaled Mohammed Atawneh, 18, the Arab hospital
officials said.
   Trouble started in the camp when soldiers tried to arrest a
Palestinian in his home and rumors spread that soldiers would
demolish the building.
   In other developments Thursday, hundreds of Jewish settlers from
Kiryat Arba near Hebron in the West Bank rioted after a firebomb
attack on an Israeli car. There were no injuries in the attack.
   Israel radio said the settlers opened fire indiscriminately, but
army radio said they were blocked by the army and could not reach
Hebron, the second largest West Bank city. No casualties were
reported.
   The army released Ghassan Khattib, a Palestinian university
lecturer detained May 15, a day before he was to meet with visiting
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross. His release came following appeals from
Peace Now, an Israeli left-wing movement.
   Also Thursday, troops demolished two houses and sealed two other
houses belonging to four suspected stone-throwers and rioters in
the village of El-Azariya near Jerusalem, the army said.

<HEAD>Researchers Say Patience Among Children Pays Off Later In Life</HEAD>

   Four-year-olds who were able to wait the
longest in pre-school for rewards of candy treats tend later in
life to accomplish more, to be more intelligent and to have higher
scores on college entrance exams, researchers said Thursday.
   That's the finding of three Columbia University researchers who
followed up on experiments conducted in the 1970s among students at
a Stanford University pre-school. The study is to be published
Friday in the journal Science.
   Columbia researchers Walter Mischel, Yuichi Shoda and Monica L.
Rodriguez reported in the study that ``children who tend to prefer
delayed rewards ... tend to be more intelligent, more likely to
resist temptation, to have greater social responsibility and higher
achievement strivings.''
   And when those children later took Scholastic Aptitude Tests for
college, the co-authors said, the patience they demonstrated in
pre-school is reflected in higher scores and better academic
performance.
   The early studies at Stanford involved teaching pre-schoolers a
game in which they were shown a pair of treats of different value
prior to being left alone in a room. The first treat, for instance,
could be one marshmallow, and the more valuable treat could be two
marshmallows.
   Each child was told that they could receive the more valuable
treat by waiting until the experimenter returned to the room.
   The wait could be ended at any time by ringing a bell, but this
would result in the least valuable of the treats. In effect, the
rule was, the longer they waited, the more they got.
   After a child was left alone, the researchers recorded the
length of the delay and observed the child without being seen.
Typically, the child was left alone for about 15 minutes, unless
the child ended the wait himself.
   A recent follow-up, said the researchers, showed that ``those
who had waited longer in this situation at 4 years of age were
described more than 10 years later by their parents as adolescents
who were more academically and socially competent than their peers
and more able to cope with frustration and resist temptation.''
   At least 35 of the children tested in the 1970s in one variation
of the experiment have since taken SAT examinations for college
admission and the researchers said, ``their verbal and
quantititative SAT scores were significantly related to seconds of
preschool delay time.''
   The more seconds that a child was able to wait while a
pre-schooler, the study said, the higher the child later scored on
the SAT tests.
   Since there was only a small sample in the group that has taken
SAT exams, the Columbia researchers said that the finding
``dictates special caution.'' They said more research is needed to
establish the relationship between learning at an early age to
``delay gratification'' and the later effects in life.
   Science, which published the study, is a the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

   The American tall ship Pride of
Baltimore II, which replaced a topsail schooner that sank in 1986,
on Thursday rescued two men whose fishing boat was sinking.
   Officials at the Halifax search and rescue center said most
rescue aircraft in the area were grounded by dense fog when the
distress call came in from the 36-foot Miss Clara at 2 p.m.
   The Pride of Baltimore II, which was sailing for Halifax to
promote Maryland tourism, picked up the call and was near the site
about 25 miles off Nova Scotia's south shore near Port Mouton.
   Coast guard vessels, four other fishing boats and an aircraft
from Prince Edward Island had set out when the rescue center was
told at 2:21 p.m. that the Pride II had taken the two men off a
life raft.
   ``They picked up the two chaps and everything was fine,'' said a
spokesman for the center.
   No reason was given for the sinking of the Miss Clara, which
went down in light seas with waves of only about 18 inches.
   The Pride II represents Maryland state and is a replica of a
Baltimore clipper from the early 1800s. It replaced the Pride of
Baltimore, which sank in a storm off Puerto Rico in May 1986 with
the loss of four lives.
   Last Sunday, the ship began a four-month cruise to Canada and
the Great Lakes to promote tourism and economic development in
Maryland. It is scheduled to visit Halifax, Montreal and Toronto,
then call at American cities on the Great Lakes.

   Students at the fore of China's wave of political
dissent live in a makeshift city of appalling squalor, in unheated
rag tents with no sewage or plumbing facilities.
   Tens of thousands camped out on the vast Tiananmen Square in the
heart of Beijing risk epidemics of flu, enteritis and
conjunctivitis because of poor sanitation, medical officials say.
   ``There are just too many people here. How can you clean all the
corners and get rid of all this garbage?'' said a nurse from Temple
of Heaven Hospital.
   ``About 40 garbage trucks come to Tiananmen every day to pick up
the trash, but look what's still here,'' she said, gesturing to one
of hundreds of piles of refuse dotting the 100-acre square.
   The students, whose numbers in the square at times have topped
200,000, have occupied it since May 13 to press for democratic
reforms.
   Thousands of plastic soda bottles, juice cartons and jagged
glass fragments are strewn among the tents. Television news said
Thursday that 143 tons of garbage had been collected.
   Buckets of waste stand beside bicycle carts distributing food.
Two public buses have been converted to toilets.
   On Wednesday, the Red Cross Society of China asked the students
to leave the square to avoid an outbreak of contagious diseases. It
urged caution in handling food and drinking water and warned
Beijing residents, who have been drawn to the scene by the hundreds
of thousands, to avoid the area.
   The Beijing Evening News said Thursday that 9,158 students had
been taken to local hospitals, most of them for stomach and eye
ailments.
   ``It's awful. We all eat with our hands, and several people
drink from the same bottle,'' said a young woman from Beijing
Agricultural Institute.
   ``Our tent's only two by three meters (6{ by 10 feet), but 14
people sleep in it lying down and several others sleep sitting up
around the sides,'' she said. ``We only have cotton jackets spread
on the ground, but they all got wet in the rain, so we were sitting
around on soggy jackets.''
   Students complain of stale air inside the tents, fouled by the
odor of unwashed bodies.
   Qi Bing, a freshman at Hubei Law School in Wuhan, a 20-hour
train ride from the Chinese capital, said he hadn't bathed in three
days and would not be able to for the next three.
   Another dozen students take shelter in a canvas-covered frame
used to cover a hospital truck. ``We have enough water to drink,
but for washing our hands and face it's something else,'' said
Zhang Fuzhi of Beijing No. 1 Light Industry School.
   Temporary latrines have been set up outside the Museum of
History on one side of the square.
   Several hospitals, including the Temple of Heaven, have pitched
their own tents among the student squatters. ``We're doing all
right as far as medicine goes, though we're getting low on
antibiotics,'' said a doctor from the hospital.
   ``I tell the students ... to take it easy and go to a hospital
if they can,'' he said. ``It's a bad environment out here. It's
dirty, it gets real hot, then real cold. It's hardly a place to get
well.''

   ABC News reported from Beijing Thursday that
sources close to the Politburo said Communist Party chief Zhao
Ziyang will be stripped of power.
   The report said Ziyang and some other members of the hierarchy
would be branded as having formed an anti-party clique.
   It quoted the sources as saying the decision was made at a
special meeting of the Politburo, the party's ruling body, led by
Deng Xiaoping, China's 84-year-old senior leader.
   An announcement on the purges is expected within days, the
report said.
   The sources told ABC that for the power shift to be enforced, a
military occupation of Beijing may be imminent.
   Others to be stripped of power are Defense Minister Qin Jiwei,
believed to have opposed the imposition of martial law in Beijing;
propaganda chief Hu Qili, who allowed the press freedom to report
the protests; and Vice Premier Tian Jiyun, who has helped implement
Zhao's liberal economic policies, ABC said.
   Weeks of mass demonstrations in Beijing and other Chinese cities
are believed to have provoked a power struggle between Zhao, a
relative moderate, and conservatives led by Premier Li Peng and
Deng.
   Also involved in the decision to make the purges was President
Yang Shangkun, ABC said. Yang has said he was embarassed by the
protesters during the recent visit by Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.

   WASHINGTON (AP)_ President Bush on Thursday designated Memorial

who died in the April 19 explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa.
   The designation came as the Pentagon said the Navy's probe of
the explosion has ``a criminal investigative aspect to it'' and
officials said the relationship between two shipmates is a focus of
the investigation.
   The FBI, originally called in to help the Naval Investigative
Service with forensic evidence work, is now exploring other
matters, the Pentagon said.
   Forty-seven sailors died in the explosion, which occurred when
one of the battleship's huge 16-inch guns was being prepared for
firing.

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said it will
issue a low-power test license for the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear
reactor Friday, after a federal appeals court rejected a last-gasp
plea by opponents.
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a ruling issued late
Thursday afternoon, refused to impose an emergency stay on
low-power tests at Seabrook, a $6 billion plant that is already a
decade behind schedule and billions over budget.
   The court order had been sought by Massachusetts Gov. Michael
Dukakis and other opponents who have tried for three years to block
low-power testing.
   In Boston, Dukakis attacked the planned low-power licensing,
saying there is no acceptable plan to evacuate nearby residents in
case of an accident ``nor is there any evidence that such a plan
can even be produced.''
   The governor and Massachusetts Attorney General James Shannon
vowed to continue the fight against a full-power commercial
operating license. ``We're not out this by a long shot,'' said
Shannon.
   NRC Chairman Lando W. Zech Jr. said a commercial license could
come as soon as this fall, but Shannon predicted ``we have a long
fight ahead of us,'' with a web of regulatory and court appeals
still to come.
   In a one-page order, the appeals court said, ``Petitions have
failed to demonstrate the requisite irreparable injury and
likelihood of success on the merits to warrant the preliminary
relief sought.''
   NRC spokesman Frank Ingram said the license would be issued
Friday morning.
   Seabrook officials said they would start preparations for atomic
testing immediately after receiving commission authorization and
begin the plant's first nuclear tests within 10 days.
   Low-power testing, which would allow the reactor to operate at 5
percent capacity, would be the biggest milestone in the checkered
20-year history of Seabrook.
   The 1,150-megawatt reactor on the southern New Hampshire coast
has been set back 10 years by protests, politics, regulatory
obstacles and financial crises that have increased the project's
cost tenfold and left the lead owner seeking bankruptcy protection.
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins this week jumped into the
fray, saying the plant is badly needed to meet New England's
increasing energy needs and avoid brownouts and other regional
energy emergencies.
   An elated Edward Brown, president of Seabrook operator New
Hampshire Yankee, said: ``We will successfully complete low-power
testing. We will go into commericial operation and we will produce
safe, efficient, clean electricity, electricity that will supply
more than 1 million New England homes and businesses.''
   ``Seabrook Station is the safest power plant that's ever been
built, and we are staffed with a team of operators and engineers
that I think are unsurpassed anywhwere in the world,'' Brown said
at a Seabrook news conference.
   The low-power license became the rallying point for Seabrook
opponents, many of whom have been trying to kill the plant for two
decades.
   Seabrook's three-year quest for a low-power license was first
halted in 1986 when Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, in the
wake of the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union, refused to
cooperate with evacuation planning for the six northeast
Massachusetts towns near the plant.
   Dukakis says it is impossible to quickly evacuate the coastal
area, especially when beach goers swell the area's summer
population.
   A low-power license was set back again last year when Seabrook's
lead owner, Public Service Company of New Hampshire, filed for
federal bankruptcy protection.
   The NRC approved the license after Seabrook officials set up a
$72.1 million fund to cover the estimated added costs of
mothballing the plant if it undergoes low-power testing but never
operates commercially. But the commissioners, in a 4-0 ruling last
Thursday, said it would delay issuance of the license for one week
to give the court time to rule on the stay petition.

   Bush and his wife, Barbara, visited the hospital to present the

   ``As a champion of the most vulnerable among us, Claude Pepper

legislative efforts and personal example, he has helped the
disadvantaged and elderly gain self respect and dignity. During six
decades of public service, Claude Pepper has built bridges that

strengthen the Social Security and Medicaid programs.
   Pepper is suffering from an undisclosed stomach ailment.

<TEXT>
   China's political crisis gave the Hong Kong Stock Exchange a bad
case of the jitters Thursday and stirred concern in Vietnam that
China might attempt ``outside adventures'' to distract from its
domestic problems.
   The European Parliament, representing the 12 European Community
member states, called in Strasbourg, France, for China's leaders to
talk to student demonstrators who for five weeks have been
demanding more democracy.
   Share prices took their worst beating in Hong Kong's morning
session since the October 1987 worldwide market collapse. They
rebounded in the afternoon but still ended the day sharply lower.
   Brokers attributed the fall to nervousness over China's power
struggle. The market snapped back after China's Foreign Affairs
Ministry announced that both antagaonists, Premier Li Peng and
Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, still held their
posts.
   British-run Hong Kong reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. Investors
there remain skittish over political shifts in China even though
the Beijing government has promised to preserve the territory's
social and economic lifestyle for 50 years.
   The Hang Seng Index of blue chips closed at 2,752.51, down
256.22 points from Wednesday. The morning session ended at 2,668.70
points, a drop of 340.03 points, before rebounding.
   Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach expressed concern in
Hanoi on Thursday that China's government may start something
outside China to deal with its political crisis at home.
   ``Over the past 40 years China has witnessed one political
upheaval every 10 years,'' he said. ``What worries foreign
countries is whether China would carry out outside adventures to
solve its internal crisis.''
   He spoke in an interview with The Associated Press.
   China shares a long and often embattled 800-mile border with
Vietnam.
   Rivalry between the two dates to 111 B.C., when China's Han
Dynasty annexed what is now Vietnam and the Vietnamese began
fighting off Chinese invasions.
   They were close allies during the Vietnamese communist war
against the Americans, but later fell out again over other issues.
   Philippines Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus said in Manila on
Thursday that the unrest in China shows that the radical ideology
of Mao Tse-tung is dying there.
   ``I think Maoism as we knew it has been dying and, with this
development, is probably to be considered in agony,'' he told
reporters. ``I don't think anybody in China anymore seriously
believes in the old Maoist ideology.''
   ``Certainly, the developments in China will have an impact on
the region,'' Manglapus added, without citing what changes could be
expected.
   In Budapest, Hungary, about 30 members of the FIDESZ independent
youth group held a two-hour rally in front of the Chinese Embassy
on Thursday in a show of solidarity with the Beijing students, the
state MTI news agency said.
   Some held aloft posters calling for more democracy in China. One
poster, addressed to the Chinese students, said, ``We Are With
You.''

<HEAD>Tap Dancers Shuffle Across Golden Gate During National Tap Day</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chorus line of shuffle-stepping tap
dancers hoofed it across the Golden Gate Bridge on Thursday,
celebrating National Tap Dance Day on the birthday of legendary
tapper Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson.
   The wind and salty air threatened to blow off their hats as
about 30 dancers shim-sham-shimmied across the span dodging
befuddled joggers and bicyclists.
   ``I don't care if I'm overweight and pushing 40. I feel like a
star,'' said tap dancer Debby Keleher, thrusting her arms out like
Ethel Merman.
   The BART escalator mechanic, who practices on broken subway
escalators in her cowgirl costume, passed a gold-sequined ``torch
of tap'' during the single-file relay watched by wide-eyed drivers.
   Against a backdrop of San Francisco skyscrapers and a vast
expanse of water below, the tappers made their way from Marin to
the San Francisco side where they received a City Hall proclamation.
   In Washington, Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., got a resolution
approved by the House declaring Thursday National Tap Dance Day.
Conyers, who admitted being a frustrated tap dancer soon to begin
lessons, was playing host to celebrations in the nation's capital
by the Tap America Project.
   ``Tap dancing is widely recognized as America's only original
form of dance, yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a
lost art,'' Conyers, said in a telephone interview.
   He said Bojangles' former dance partner, 65-year-old Lloyd
Story, tried to tap on the House floor but was barred by the
parliamentarian, who said it violated rules against demonstrations.
   On the bridge, English tourist Joan Burke let out a whoop when
the dancers assembled.
   ``Oh great. We saw `42nd Street,' the musical in London. Yes,
it's super. This is a bonus,'' Burke said as her husband, Paul,
snapped pictures of dancers from the group Rosie Radiator and the
San Francisco Supertappers.
   The troupe, led by Rosie in her red flared skirt, white tuxedo
vest, and sailor hat, is listed in the Guinness Book of World
Records for longest tap dance for its 7.3-mile performance in 1987.
   Seven tap dancers with sandwich boards were barred from crossing
the span by officials who feared written words would distract
commuters on the six-lane bridge.
   But everything was copacetic, as Bojangles used to say, for an
``aerobitapper,'' with metal taps on her running shoes, and a
tapping clown, who stomped their way across.
   Tap, a rhythmic art that blends African dance with the Irish jig
and lively English clog, originated among black dancers performing
on street corners and in saloons.
   Unlike ballet dancers, tap dancers hold their body limp like a
rag doll and use the natural movements to belt out rhythms with
their feet.
   Tap greats such as Bill ``Bojangles'' Robinson, who died in
1949, and Howard ``Sandman'' Sims popularized the dance in musical
extravaganzas of the 1930s and 40s.
   ``There is a happiness there when I tap dance,'' said hoofer
Marilyn Winston. ``There are very few ways that comes out of my
body. It's a natural happiness that comes out of me. I have to tap
to live.''

<TEXT>
   A Canadian woman conspired with dozens of
computer hackers across the United States, some as young as 14, in
a scheme to steal as much as $1.5 million in goods, services and
cash, authorities said Thursday.
   Leslie Lynn Doucette, 35, was charged with conspiring to steal
telephone and computer service, the U.S. attorney's office said.
She was charged with trafficking in illegal credit cards and
telephone calling-card numbers on corporate and government
voice-mail computers.
   Ms. Doucette, arrested Wednesday in Chicago, is from Toronto,
and was convicted in Canada in 1987 of telecommunications fraud,
said Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Cook.
   Authorities believe her operation involved at least 50 people in
several states, Cook said.
   Federal agents have questioned pairs of teen-agers in Columbus,
Ohio; Sterling Heights, Mich.; and Boston; and they impounded the
computer equipment of a 15-year-old in Marietta, Ga., authorities
said. Search warrants also were issued in Los Angeles, Cook said.
   U.S. Magistrate Joan Lefkow ordered Ms. Doucette, whose two
children live with her, held without bond at least temporarily,
Cook said.
   Earlier in the four-month investigation, ``she called the
attorney general's office in Arizona and indicated ... they weren't
going to be able to locate her,'' Cook said.
   If convicted, Ms. Doucette faces up to 10 years in prison for
illegal use of computer-access devices, 5 years for wire fraud and
5 years for conspiracy, Cook said.
   In Sterling Heights, Mich., Secret Service agents questioned two
eighth-graders said to have admitted belonging to the hacking
network. The 14-year-old boys ``got hooked because of their
fascination with the medium,'' said James Huse of the Secret
Service's Detroit office.
   One of the boys ran up a $3,800 phone bill for April because he
mistakenly thought he was making free long-distance calls, Huse
said.
   Authorities estimated the value of goods and services obtained
illegally by the network to be between $200,000 and $1.5 million.
Huse said investigators still had to sort through evidence to find
out what the hackers ordered with other people's credit cards, and
how much revenue long-distance companies lost.
   Court documents in Chicago charged that Ms. Doucette, using the
code-name ``Kyrie,'' infiltrated electronic ``mailboxes'' in which
businesses store and exchange information and messages.
   The hackers communicated with each other through companies'
private mailboxes to avoid the scrutiny police have been giving to
public ``bulletin boards,'' the forums where computer users
normally share information, authorities said.
   The hackers used their computers to program their telephones to
keep dialing until they got into an electronic mailbox, prosecutors
said. There they found codes that gave them access to other
computers or telephone services, credit card numbers and other data.
   Ms. Doucette, for example, obtained at least $1,000 in money
orders purchased from Western Union with credit cards whose numbers
she passed on to other hackers, Cook said.
   Home Box Office and RCA Telephone System Sales also suffered
losses, Huse said.

   House Speaker Jim Wright has all but decided
to resign his leadership post, friends said Thursday, but he
remained torn over details of his leaving and insisted he had
``done no serious wrong'' despite numerous ethics allegations.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
plans were being made for Wright to make a farewell address to the
House on Wednesday.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley of Washington appeared to be the
odds-on favorite to replace him in the top post in the House.
   Foley, at a news conference in Seattle, said he knew of no plans
by Wright to resign, but he said Wright expressed a desire to state
his case next week or shortly afterward.
   Wright, first elected to Congress 34 years ago, remained in his
Capitol office during the day. From there, he issued a statement
proclaiming there would be ``no deal'' in which he would quit his
post in exchange for dismissal of some of the ethics committee
charges.
   But his departure seemed ever more likely.
   ``There are plans for Wednesday, but we don't know if he'll do
it,'' said one friend of the Texas Democrat. ``He's torn between
wanting to be heard (in an ethics committee hearing) and doing
what's best for himself and the House.''
   The speaker was said to have been personally hurt by reports on
Wednesday that he had sought to negotiate a plea bargaining
arrangement with the ethics committee, which charged him April 17
with 69 violations of House rules.
   In his statement, he said: ``There is no deal now. There will be
no deal in the future. ... I earnestly believe that I have
committed no serious wrong in the conduct of my official duties or
of my private affairs.''
   But it was clear that there had been a flurry of proposals and
counter-proposals between Wright's representatives and the ethics
panel on Wednesday. Those efforts fell short of agreement, but some
on both sides still held out hope that a negotiated settlement
could be achieved.
   Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., a member of Wright's legal
defense team who was involved in the talks, said he believed a
consensus was emerging among ethics committee members that charges
Wright improperly accepted gifts from a businessman friend with a
direct interest in legislation were not well founded.
   The other serious charge against Wright _ that he evaded House
limits on outside income through bulk sales of his book to groups
to which he had delivered speeches _ was believed by panel members
to be on solid ground, Torricelli said.
   Wright spokesman Mark Johnson said the Texas Democrat planned a
weekend getaway with his wife Betty to an undisclosed location. One
lawmaker close to the talks speculated that Wright would spend the
time writing his final speech.
   ``I think he just wants his day in the well,'' said the source,
referring to the front of the House chamber.
   The ethics panel was scheduled to meet again next Thursday. But
that session could be rendered moot if Wright both stepped down as
speaker and, as associates have reasoned, resigned his House seat.
Friends of the speaker said he was making his plans independent of
any action by the ethics committee and was not deterred by the
collapse of Wednesday's talks.
   As the planning continued, would-be successors to Wright and
other House Democratic leaders who might move up or out in a
shake-up could not restrain behind-the-scenes campaigning.
   ``There's a certain amount of inappropriateness in mounting a
campaign before the funeral,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont.
``Our bizarre system in Congress somehow puts the hanging in front
of the trial, and Jim Wright looks up and it's his corpse that's
swinging,'' he said.
   Foley publicly dismissed assertions that Wright was poised to
resign. But fellow House Democrats were already privately assuming
he would shortly be speaker.
   ``I have no expectations that the speaker is going to resign,''
Foley said in Seattle. ``He repeated his desire to have an
opportunity to state his case, his side of the case, to the widest
possible audience and he's determined to take that opportunity at
the first time that seems appropriate. I assume that will be with
either next week or shortly thereafter.''
   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., was being urged strongly by
supporters to run to replace Foley as majority leader, the No. 2
position. It was unclear whether the third-ranking Democrat in the
House, majority whip Tony Coelho of California, would seek to move
up or would be prevented from doing so by separate ethics questions
that have arisen over his business dealings.
   Contenders also were lining up for the No. 3 whip's spot,
including Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the current chief deputy
whip, and Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa.
   Congressional sources confirmed that Wednesday's talks,
including offers by Wright's lawyers for him to resign his
leadership post in return for dropping some of the most serious
charges, had fallen apart.
   One lawmaker close to the discussions said there was still a
willingness on the part of ethics committee members, Democrats and
Republicans alike, to craft a negotiated settlement.
   However, Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the ethics committee's
senior Republican, said any sort of ``plea-bargaining'' arrangement
would be unprecedented and would set a nightmarish example for the
future.
   ``There have been members who have quit rather than face
charges, but we have no control over that,'' Myers said. ``But
where we have control, we say, we'll drop this if you'll do that.
... I don't really think the House of Representatives should do
this.''
   The effort was complicated by publicity about the dealing, said
one legislator who commented only on condition he not be named. He
said committee chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., ``doesn't want to
be perceived as asking for a negotiated settlement, and the speaker
doesn't either.''

<HEAD>Ireland's Minority Government Calls Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's minority
government, elected 28 months ago by the narrowest margin possible,
on Thursday called for a general election June 15 in a bid to
capitalize on Ireland's economic revival and gain a majority.
   Haughey rose in the Dail, or parliament, and in a one-line
statement said he would ask President Patrick Hillery to formally
dissolve the 166-seat legislature.
   The election is timed to coincide with elections to the
12-nation European Parliament.
   Haughey is midway through a maximum five-year term. His fiscal
austerity has brought a turnaround from harsh recession, reflected
in a low inflation rate of 3.3 percent, a trade surplus and a
moderate economic growth rate.
   But with interest rates creeping up this month to 9.25 percent
and signs inflation may rise, Haughey wants to try for an outright
parliamentary majority before the economic situation deteriorates.
   In February 1987, Haughey and his Fianna Fail Party failed to
win a majority in the Dail for the second time. He won power on the
vote of a lone left-wing maverick, toppling the 1982-87 coalition
government of Garret FitzGerald.
   Fianna Fail is riding high in opinion polls, and critics say
opposition parties, led by the main opposition Fine Gael under its
new leader Alan Dukes, are in disarray and unable to offer a
credible alternative.
   An opinion poll published in the Sunday Independent newspaper on
May 7 gave Fianna Fail a 50 percent approval rating against 28
percent for the opposition. It said Haughey's personal approval has
climbed to a 54-percent peak.
   Critics complain that the improvements in this island republic
of 3.4 million people are not filtering through to the poor and the
young. Unemployment remains at 17.9 percent and emigration, at an
estimated 32,000 a year, is at its highest level since the 1950s.

   As Jacqueline Onassis and President Kennedy's two
children looked on Thursday, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy announced the
creation of an award honoring political courage in public officials.
   The ``John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award'' was created to
honor the slain president and promote individualism among the
nation's public officials.
   ``Too often, contemporary elected officials are captives of
popular opinion and public opinion polls,'' Kennedy told a news
conference at the John F. Kennedy Library. ``They're unwilling to
resist partisan or regional pressures or offend powerful interest
groups.''
   The name of the $40,000 award is based on John Kennedy's book
``Profiles in Courage,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1957.
   ``Ever since then, he has been closely linked in the public mind
with that idea,'' said Kennedy, D-Mass. ``We feel that the concept
of political courage captures the essence of President Kennedy's
enduring appeal, his vision of public service, and the continuing
challenge of elective office.''
   After Kennedy's remarks, reporters called on Mrs. Onassis,
wearing a hot pink jacket and a black miniskirt, to speak. But she
touched her son John's shoulder, saying, ``He'll speak for the
family.''
   The younger Kennedy spoke briefly, saying the award ``means a
great deal ... hopefully it will be administered well in years to
come.''
   His sister, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, also attended the news
conference.
   The award will be presented each year to those in public life
who demonstrate a ``principled stand for what they believe is right
on fundamental issues of the day, even though they are risking
their careers and the wrath of their constituents.''
   Award recipients will be named on John Kennedy's birthday May
29, according to the Kennedy family. The president, who was
assassinated in Dallas in 1963, would have been 72 years old this
Memorial Day.
   The first award will be presented next year.
   ``Our family is attempting to shift the tributes to President
Kennedy from the date of his assassination in November to the date
of his birth in May,'' Sen. Kennedy said. ``We want to remember his
life, not relive his death.''

   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini got out of his hospital bed Thursday and rested in a
chair, two days after undergoing surgery on his digestive tract,
state-run Tehran television reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, showed Khomeini propped up
in bed in a Tehran hospital and saying a few words with his eyes
shut, and a tube in his nose. It did not show him sitting in a
chair.
   The medical team treating the 89-year-old leader said in a
statement that his condition was ``very good.'' It said his
``cardio-vascular system, blood pressure, pulse, respiration and
kidneys are satisfactory.''
   The statement said the internal bleeding that prompted the
operation was ``completely under control'' and that he had no need
of a blood transfusion after the operation.
   The medical statements issued on Khomeini's condition have not
named his illness.
   The television also repeated footage of Khomeini in the hospital
before the operation in response to thousands of telephone calls, a
commentator said.
   The film showed the Iranian leader sitting up in bed combing his
beard and performing his prayers.
   The commentary said, ``This is the hour not to think of the
operation but to be with God.''

   A common virus killed the nation's first
heart-pancreas transplant patient, doctors at the Washington
Hospital Center said Thursday.
   About 80 percent of the population has carried the cytomegalo
virus at some point, but when Barry Katz contracted it he was
unable to fend it off, said Dr. John Macoviak, director of
transplant surgery.
   Katz, a 45-year-old Defense Department physicist from Silver
Spring, Md., died Wednesday night with family and friends at his
side, Macoviak said. Katz had been in critical condition since
undergoing surgery on March 25.
   Katz initially was given an 80 percent chance of surviving for a
year following the operation.
   Doctors were hopeful immediately after the surgery, when Katz
responded well, said hospital spokesman Alexander Sinclair, but he
suffered a setback in April, when an ulcer developed near the
transplanted pancreas and was removed.

<HEAD>Survival of AIDS Patients Better At Experienced Hospitals, Study
Suggests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS patients with a form of pneumonia commonly
fatal to them are more than three times as likely to survive in
hospitals experienced in treating AIDS sufferers than in other
hospitals, a study suggests.
   The findings support the belief that regional centers are needed
to provide the best care for people with the AIDS virus, said
authors of the study published in Friday's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The study involved 257 AIDS patients with the infection called
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. It found that the in-hospital death
rate was only 12 percent at experienced hospitals, compared with 33
percent at hospitals less familiar with AIDS.
   After making statistical adjustments to correct for differences
in severity of illness, the in-hospital death rate for AIDS
patients with the pneumonia was about 3.6 times higher than in less
experienced hospitals, the study said.
   Researchers said they studied patients with the pneumonia
because it is a common complication of AIDS, often treated
successfully, but frequently leading to death.
   Hospitals considered experienced in the study were those that
discharged at least 30 patients with AIDS-related medical problems
for every 10,000 patients discharged overall.
   All patients studied were at 15 California hospitals,
researchers said.
   It is likely that the technology for fighting AIDS is being
developed unevenly among the nation's hospitals ``and that
hospitals with low AIDS familiarity are at a marked disadvantage in
the treatment of patients with AIDS,'' said the researchers, led by
Dr. Charles L. Bennett of the RAND@University of California at Los
Angeles Center for Health Policy Study and the UCLA School of
Medicine.
   Creating regional AIDS centers soon would be a tough job,
according to an accompanying JAMA editorial in which Dr. Deborah J.
Cotton of Beth Israel Hospital in Boston said the nation's health
care system is already in crisis.
   Problems would include how to meet the patients' needs for
long-term care and community services outside the centers and the
possibility that special hospitals ``might increase the isolation
and stigmatization experienced by patients with AIDS.''
   ``Nonetheless, the creation of such centers should be considered
urgently as part of along-term planning strategies,'' she wrote.
``As AIDS therapy becomes more complex, the ability of many
acute-care hospitals to provide such therapy will become
increasingly difficult.''

   The new parliament on Thursday reaffirmed its
predecessor's choice of Mikhail Gorbachev as president in a session
marked by unprecedented debate and tough questioning of a Soviet
leader.
   Gorbachev won more than 95 percent of the vote in uncontested
balloting at the opening session of the Congress of People's
Deputies, the first competitively chosen Soviet parliament.
   Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin withdrew his name before the
vote, and the new parliament rejected a member who tried to
nominate himself.
   Although opponents of the established leadership were a distinct
minority, the combative atmosphere contrasted sharply with that of
previous Soviet parliaments that rubber-stampedthe actions of the
Kremlin leadership.
   Gorbachev received 2,123 of the 2,210 votes cast, Yuri A.
Osipyan, chairman of the commission that counted the ballots,
announced during the nationally televised proceedings. Eighty-seven
deputies voted against the Communist Party chief, Osipyan said, and
11 abstained.
   Gorbachev, who has led the Soviet Union since 1985, had been
elected president on Oct. 1 by the congress' predecessor, the
Supreme Soviet. He succeeded Andrei A. Gromyko in what was then a
largely ceremonial post.
   In the new governmental structure, the five-year presidency is
to be invested with greater powers, including the chairmanship of
the Defense Council and the right to propose laws and negotiate
with foreign powers.
   In a clear reference to past Soviet dictatorships, Gorbachev
vowed ``to pursue the line of democracy until the very end, so that
what has happened in this country will never again be repeated.''
   Communist Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told reporters
the party's victory in nationwide balloting in March entitled it to
pick its leader as president.
   ``The party went through the election process, it won support,
therefore the so-called Cabinet will be formed from its leaders,''
Medvedev said.
   One deputy sought to nominate Yeltsin to run against Gorbachev
for president, and a little-known engineer from Leningrad offered
himself as a sacrifice alternative to the Soviet leader.
   ``I'm no idiot, and I understand perfectly well that I have no
chances in a struggle with Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev,'' said
Alexander Obolensky, the engineer. ``But I want there to be a
precedent of an alternative in elections in our history.''
   Human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, who was voted down
when he tried to require a state-of-the-union report from Gorbachev
before the election, said he would not take part in the secret
ballot.
   ``We can't let these elections just be a formality,'' the 1975
Nobel Peace Prize winner said. Sakharov was one of four deputies
who abstained when the body voted to place Gorbachev's name on the
ballot. No one voted against.
   Estonian activist Marju Lauristin offered Gorbachev her vote on
condition he answer some tough questions first.
   She said she wanted to know who in the ruling Politburo knew
about plans to use troops to break up a pro-independence
demonstration in Soviet Georgia last month and how soon Gorbachev
learned of them. Twenty people died in the unrest.
   ``There have been mistakes, major oversights,'' Gorbachev said.
``And some of them didn't have to happen. I'm suffering because of
them, too.
   ``We understand with our brains that it's necessary to change,''
he said. ``But the system doesn't let us.''
   Gorbachev said he had intended to send Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze, a Georgian, to Tbilisi before the demonstration
but was advised the situation was under control.
   Others demanded explanations for the privileges enjoyed by
Soviet leaders and of a decree banning statements that discredit
authorities. Some questioned whether he should serve as both
Communist Party chief and head of state.
   Yeltsin, whose populist campaign garnered 90 percent of the vote
in citywide elections in Moscow, took himself out of the running
after being nominated by a deputy from his native Sverdlovsk region
in the Urals.
   Yeltsin noted that as a member of the party's Central Committee,
he was bound by its decision to support Gorbachev. Only 14 deputies
opposed a motion not to put his name on the ballot.
   With the exception of the secret ballot, the entire session was
televised live, offering Soviets a rare look at the workings of
their government. Still, the Soviets' lack of experience with
parliamentary democracy was apparent.
   Gorbachev, as presiding officer, arbitrarily called for votes on
some procedural issues while ignoring others. Only a few deputies
objected.
   There was fierce debate over procedural issues, but the agenda
hammered out in advance by Gorbachev and a few hundred deputies in
a private caucus Wednesday was adopted by a lopsided margin.
Sakharov and economist Gavril Popov led the fight against the
establishment.
   Sakharov, once the nation's most famed dissident and now a
member of the parliament, praised Gorbachev.
   ``I don't see another person who could lead the country at this
time,'' said the winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize. But he added
Gorbachev should first be required to give an account of the
mistakes and achievements of his reform program.
   Gorbachev, a giant statue of Vladimir I. Lenin at his back,
frequently intervened in the debate amid shouts from the floor,
guiding and controlling the assembly in the vast auditorium of the
Kremlin's marble-and-glass Palace of Congresses.
   At least 80 percent of the deputies are Communist Party members,
but the presence of a small band of reformers _ including
grassroots activists from the three tiny Baltic republics _ assured
that the congress will differ from the docile parliaments of the
past.
   Deputies squabbled over every point of the agenda.
   ``Just a moment, I haven't given you the floor,'' Gorbachev told
one deputy who walked to the podium and began to speak. ``I'll give
you the floor, but you have to ask for it.'' The member was then
permitted to speak.

   U.S. Rep. Donald Lukens acknowledged
having sex with a girl he knew was a minor, a private investigator
testified Thursday at a trial at which the congressman had no
defense witnesses.
   ``He admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with Rosie
Coffman,'' said J.D. Caudill, the final witness called by
prosecutors.
   Lukens' attorney Thomas Tyack, who called no witnesses, said the
defense was strapped by Judge Ronald Solove's refusal to allow him
to bring up Ms. Coffman's juvenile delinquency and school records.
   ``It puts us in the position of this man being tried in a
vacuum,'' Tyack said.
   Lukens, a 58-year-old conservative Republican, is being tried on
a misdemeanor charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.
The Franklin County Domestic Relations Court jury is expected to
get the case Friday. If convicted, Lukens could be sentenced to 180
days in jail and a $1,000 fine.
   Assistant Prosecutor Rita Mangini said she had proved that Ms.
Coffman engaged in prostitution and consumed alcohol, both elements
of unruliness and delinquency, as a result of Lukens' actions.
   ``I would submit under these facts that Mr. Lukens is an immoral
person,'' she said.
   Caudill, a former Dayton police officer hired by Lukens' former
attorney, said the congressman admitted to the sexual encounter
when he came to Caudill's office for a polygraph examination Jan.
30.
   Caudill testified that Lukens, who is divorced, told him that
when the congressman and Ms. Coffman had sex at his apartment on
Nov. 6 she told him she would turn 18 the next day.
   Ms. Coffman, who actually was to turn 17, on Wednesday testified
that she had lied to Lukens by telling him she was 18 or 19. But
she said she also gave him her real birthdate: Nov. 7, 1971.
   Earlier Thursday, the jury heard a taped telephone conversation
in which Lukens, unaware that the FBI and police were recording the
call, denied to Anna Coffman, Rosie's mother, that he had sex with
the girl.
   In the tape, Lukens told Anna Coffman that her daughter had been
calling him and asked that she stop it. Mrs. Coffman said on the
tape that her daughter had confessed to her that she had sex with
Lukens on Nov. 6, the previous Sunday.
   ``She was there with Mercedes. What Mercedes and I did was
private. Your daughter had nothing to do with it,'' Lukens replied
on the tape. Mercedes was the name used by Rosie Coffman's friend,
Michelle Foster, then 19, who had invited Ms. Coffman to Lukens'
apartment that night.
   But Lukens in the phone call also asked Anna Coffman whether she
was still ``interested in the job.'' Mrs. Coffman has testified
Lukens earlier that day met her at a restaurant and tried to bribe
her with an offer to help her find a government job. Lukens claims
she was trying to extort money from him in exchange for her silence.
   Reporter Ted Hart of WSYX-TV in Columbus, who arranged to
secretly videotape the meeting between Anna Coffman and Lukens at
the restaurant, acknowledged the station paid for Anna and Rosie
Coffman's two-night stay at a hotel beginning Feb. 22, the day
Lukens was indicted.
   He denied that the station paid the Coffmans any money before
that for their story. Anna Coffman was first interviewed in
November after she called WSYX for help.
   Rosie Coffman had testified Wednesday that Lukens made her wear
a black robe to have sex with him and made racial slurs during the

disciplinary action by the ethics committee.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Sunken Sub Was Powered By Water-Cooled Reactors</HEAD>

   The Soviet Union has informed Norway that a
submarine that sank in the Norwegian Sea on April 7 was powered by
conventional water-cooled reactors with low-enriched uranium cores,
officials said Thursday.
   Officials had thought that the Komsomolets was powered by more
dangerous liquid-metal-cooled reactors with high-enriched uranium
cores. Forty-two Soviet crewmen died in the accident.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Sigrid Romundset said the Soviet
Foreign Ministry gave the information in a letter delivered to the
Norwegian Embassy in Moscow on Wednesday.
   ``The Soviet reply was surprising but reassuring. It will now be
studied by experts to make sure there are no misunderstandings
concerning the reactor types,'' said Knut Gussgard of Norway's
nuclear inspection agency, which had asked the Soviets for
information on the reactors.
   ``Some of our questions still remain unanswered, among them the
exact reactor size and the quantity of radioactive material in the
cores,'' he said.
   Johan Baarli, director of the Norwegian National Institute of
Radiation Protection, said earlier that tests last month showed
that the submarine's reactors and weapons have withstood tremendous
water pressure. Water samples collected near the sunken sub showed
no radiation that could be attributed to the vessel, the institute
said.

   Mayor Sophie Masloff was confused Thursday as
to who is coming to town for a rock concert this summer.
   Masloff, 71, who recently called the Grateful Dead the
``Dreadful Dead'' and the group's fans ``Deadenders,'' asked Three
Rivers Stadium officials about an upcoming concert by ``The How.''
   ``Not The How, The Who,'' said George Whitmer, the stadium
authority's chairman.
   ``The who?'' Masloff asked.
   ``Yes,'' Whitmer replied.
   ``Is there a Who group and a How group?'' Masloff asked.
``Somebody asked me the other day if The How was coming here.''
   ``What the hell is The How?'' said state Sen. Eugene Scanlon,
who, like Masloff, is an authority member.
   ``There isn't a group called The How as far as I know,'' said
Gerald Baron of Spectacor Management, which runs the stadium.

   A prisoner was killed and 48 others were
reported injured Thursday after some of the worst violence at
Folsom Prison in several years erupted in an exercise yard,
officials said.
   Guards fired 10 shots to break up the melee, wounding three
prisoners, said prison spokeswoman Lt. Cammy Voss.
   The three were hospitalized, as were two convicts who were
stabbed, Voss said.
   The fight appeared to have been racially motivated, Voss said.
Mostly black and Hispanic prisoners and a couple of white prisoners
were involved.
   Authorities don't believe the fight was gang-related, she said.
``We don't know why it erupted. There was no buildup that led up to
this ...''
   Officers locked all 7,000 inmates at the maximum-security prison
20 miles east of Sacramento into their cells.
   The slain inmate, who was black, was identified as Michael
Coleman, 29. He arrived at the prison April 20 to serve a four-year
term for a Los Angeles County armed robbery.
   Forty-three inmates were treated at the prison infirmary for
minor stab wounds, scrapes and cuts, said prison spokesman D.L.
Porter.
   However, not all the injuries were believed to have been
suffered in the fight, said state Department of Corrections
spokesman Tipton Kindel.
   Guards strip-searched the approximately 300 men who were in the
yard during the fight, Kindel said. Officers were required to list
all injuries not previously reported to authorities.
   ``Some of the injuries they said they knew were at least a day
old,'' he said. ``But by the procedures, they had to write those
down.''
   Voss said the fight was the worst violence at a new wing of the
prison that opened in 1986 and perhaps the worst at the entire
prison since racial violence involving mainly Hispanic and black
prison gang members led to an extended lockdown seven years ago.

   The arrest of five high school boys _
including twins who co-captain the football team _ in the sexual
assault of a mentally retarded teen-ager has some students
condemning their classmates and others rallying to their defense.
   Eight other male teens, including the son of a police lieutenant
in the affluent town, cheered while they watched the attack,
investigators said. They are considered witnesses and have not been
charged.
   The five Glen Ridge High School students were arrested Wednesday
and charged with sexually assaulting the then 17-year-old girl with
a broomstick and miniature baseball bat.
   The case sparked taunts, threats and incidents of vandalism at
the school of 340 pupils. Thursday was the annual ``spring day'' at
Glen Ridge High and along with the picnics and games there were
fights, car vandalism and graffiti scrawled on walls inside the
school, students said.
   The five who were charged were suspended from school Thursday
for 10 days ``because of the disruption their presence in the
school would have on the educational program,'' said Superintendent
Rose McCaffrey.
   Damian DeVito, a 17-year-old junior, defended the accused
teen-agers, two of whom are his football teammates. He said he has
known the victim since elementary school and said he believes she
willingly participated in the March 1 incident.
   ``I know them well enough to know they wouldn't do anything
against somebody's will,'' DeVito said. ``These kids are really not
bad kids at all.''
   Nearby, one student removed a rock and shards of glass from the
back seat of his car. Some passers-by in cars shouted ``rapists''
as they went past the school.
   Students said one school wall inside had messages directed
against the youths accused in the case.
   Some students who were interviewed refused to give their names,
saying they were frightened by threats made by friends of the
accused students. A junior said he received a death threat
Wednesday from a telephone caller who warned him against talking
about the case.
   A girl who gave her name as W. Sanford said some students were
pulling together to support those involved. ``You've got to give
sympathy to both sides,'' she said.
   School officials refused Thursday to allow journalists onto the
campus, saying it would be disruptive. Reporters spoke to students
in the parking lot of the school in this community of 8,000 people
about 20 miles from New York City.
   The unidentified victim, now 18, met a group of youths in a
local park and then went to the nearby home of two of the teens
charged in the case, 18-year-old twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer,
said Essex County Prosecutor Herbert Tate. The twins are
co-captains of the school football team and Kyle captains the
baseball team.
   The prosecutor said the girl is mentally retarded but refuses to
elaborate on the seriousness of her condition.
   Tate said the girl told a teacher about the attack on March 4
and that relatives and school officials took the information to
police on March 22. Police notified the prosecutor's office a week
later. The prosecutor's office took charge of the investigation
April 12.
   The teen-agers were arrested Wednesday morning. Tuesday night,
WNBC-TV in New York had broadcast a report on the case.
   Karl Greiner, a spokesman for the Association for Retarded
Citizens-New Jersey, called the attack demeaning.
   ``I suppose that she was treated like an object ... a
dehumanizing affair at best, with spectators cheering on,'' Greiner
said. ``It's difficult enough to live your life with a handicap.
It's especially difficult to be treated in a dehumanizing way.''
   Kevin Scherzer was charged with one count of conspiracy to
commit sexual assault, and two counts each of aggravated criminal
sexual contact and aggravated sexual assault.
   Kyle Scherzer and Peter Quigley, 18, were charged with
conspiracy and two counts of aggravated sexual assault. Quigley was
accused of cheering on the assault.
   A 17-year-old male and another student who has since turned 18
are charged as juveniles on all three counts, Tate said. Both boys
have appeared in Family Court, said Ray Weiss, a spokesman for Tate.
   The three students charged as adults are free on bail. One of
the two charged as juveniles was released to his parents, and the
other was in a juvenile detention house.

<HEAD>Cabinet Reshuffled; Political, Economic Paralysis Spark Unrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lame-duck President Raul Alfonsin
on Thursday replaced his economy minister after weeks of political
paralysis and economic deterioration led hungry people to loot food
stores.
   Over the past three days, about a dozen supermarkets and food
stores in three of Argentina's biggest cities _ Cordoba, Rosario
and Mendoza _ were raided. Groups of men, women and children
entered the stores and filled shopping carts with food _ or ate it
on the spot _ and then fled.
   The Cabinet reshuffle was forced by the loss of Alfonsin's
Radical Civic Union to the Peronist Party in the May 14 national
elections. Alfonsin and President-elect Carlos Menem had discussed
plans to let Menem take over before Alfonsin's term expires Dec.
10, but the talks broke down.
   Jesus Rodriguez, chairman of the Budget and Treasury Committee
in the Chamber of Deputies, was named economy minister to replace
Juan Carlos Pugliese, who lasted less than two months in the job.
   Rodriguez, 33, is Alfonsin's fourth economy minister. Pugliese,
74, moved over to the Interior Ministry.
   Foreign Minister Dante Caputo, who recently was elected to the
Chamber of Deputies, was replaced by his top aide at the ministry,
Susana Ruiz Cerrutti.
   Most of the looting disturbances were relatively peaceful, but
police in Rosario used tear gas and rubber bullets Wednesday to
disperse a crowd of about 500. Several people suffered minor
injuries and several were arrested.
   In the capital, Buenos Aires, riot police were stationed at the
biggest supermarkets Thursday. No incidents were reported.
   Store officials initially withheld details of the disturbances
and presidential press secretary Jose Ignacio Lopez urged
newspapers to play down the incidents so as not to encourage
further raids.
   The two biggest newspapers in Buenos Aires, La Nacion and
Clarin, carried reports of the raids on inside pages. The Buenos
Aires Herald, however, bannered the story on the front page.
   Argentina has suffered a 90 percent devaluation of its currency,
the austral, since February. Inflation may hit 70 percent this
month. A severe budget deficit has forced double-digit rate hikes
for public services and delays in wage increases.
   Alfonsin's government has been in a quandary since Menem and the
Peronists won the May elections.
   Alfonsin retains political power, but Menem has the public
support needed to implement an unpopular economic program. But the
two could not agree on Menem taking office early, and on Tuesday
Alfonsin pledged to remain as scheduled until Dec. 10. He was to
swear in a new Cabinet Friday and unveil a new program Sunday.
   It was unclear what policies the new Cabinet would implement to
stabilize an economy whose deterioration cost Alfonsin's party
re-election.
   Recently the crisis in Argentina has had even more of an impact
on ordinary citizens. Meat prices jumped 70 percent this week and
consumption has dropped. Shoppers stare at packages of coffee or
cartons of milk, shake their heads and walk away without making a
purchase.
   Bakers say flour is so expensive they can't buy it to make
bread. Pharmacies, supermarkets and department stores that used to
sell on credit now insist on cash. Some have rationed supplies.
Many have bare shelves.
   ``The clerk told me, `We're not a bank,' when I went in to buy
medicine for my husband,'' said a middle-aged woman who asked that
she not be identified. ``He was on the operating table and the
hospital didn't have the drug. I grabbed the medicine and left my
watch'' at the pharmacy.
   Aldo Bignola, a 23-year-old auto mechanic waiting in line at the
Spanish consulate for a work visa, said, ``This is my home and I
hope to return to it and live here and die here. But not if it
means starving to death because I don't have any work.''
   Teachers, airline personnel and workers for the state oil
company say they will strike or stage job actions next week to
press demands for pay raises.
   A survey this week by the Latin America Research Foundation
indicated that businesses are operating at 66 percent of capacity,
and stocks are extremely low. Four of every 10 described their
economic situation as ``bad.''
   Dealers were allowed to raise new car prices by 105 to 183
percent effective Thursday. Many apartment owners now charge in
dollars and even middle class Buenos Aires residents find it
difficult to pay the rent, let alone save enough to buy their own
homes.
   Banks, some of which are on the verge of collapse, limit
withdrawals to 20,000 australs, or about $100, every two days.
   Begining Friday, the Central Bank will issue 5,000-austral
notes. In June 1985 when the austral was introduced, each was worth
about $1.20. Today, each is worth less than one cent.
   La Semana magazine taped an austral to each cover of its current
edition, the lead story of which was entitled, ``The Death of the
Austral.''

<HEAD>`Indiana Jones' Has Third-Best Movie Opening Ever</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade'' enjoyed
the third-best opening night in movie history, according to
box-office figures released Thursday.
   Some moviegoers, including 40 fans at the Chinese theater on
Hollywood Boulevard, camped out overnight to be the first to see
Jones' latest exploits.
   Some adorned themselves in Jones' regalia, including the
trademark fedora and scuffed leather jacket, and a few even carried
bullwhips or replica revolvers for dispatching imaginary evildoers.
   The third, and perhaps final, chapter in the adventures of the
1930s archaelogist played by Harrison Ford collected more than
$5.62 million on 2,327 movie screens Wednesday night, $600,000 less
than opening night champions ``Return of the Jedi'' and ``Rocky
IV.''
   ``Return of the Jedi'' collected $6.2 million its first
Wednesday night in 1983, and ``Rocky IV'' drew more than $5.68
million its first Wednesday in 1985.
   ``Indiana Jones'' may go on to claim the largest opening week
ever, when complete box-office figures are released next Tuesday.
   John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., said
``Indiana Jones'' could gross more than $50 million in its first
week, topping the record $45.7 million debut week in 1984 of
``Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''
   Admission records were broken at several theaters showing
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' including the Mann Chinese
in Hollywood. The box-office grosses were bolstered by new $7
tickets at several local theaters.
   In the new film, set in 1938, Indy is reconciled with his
father, played by Sean Connery, and the two battle the Nazis to
recover the Holy Grail.
   The film completes the trilogy begun in 1981 with ``Raiders of
the Lost Ark,'' in which the Indiana Jones character retrieved
another precious relic from the Nazis.

   Japan lashed out at the United States Friday for
targeting Japanese trade barriers under a U.S. trade law that could
lead to stiff tariffs on Japanese exports to its biggest market.
   Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno called the action ``extremely
regrettable.''
   He said it was unfair ``because the United States has
unilaterally made such a decision on the trade practices of other
countries including Japan, despite the fact that the U.S. itself
maintains import restrictive measures and practices to a
considerable degree.''
   The Foreign Minister urged the United States to reduce its
``huge budget deficit.'' He said the so-called ``Super 301'' list
of unfair trade practices was an attempt to ``divert attention from
the major cause of the trade imbalance'' between the two countries
and to deny U.S. responsibility for faltering economic policies.
   ``As a result of many market-opening measures which have been
taken to date, the Japanese market has now become a widely open
market,'' Uno said. ``None of the identified `priority practices'
can be considered to constitute trade barriers.''
   The Bush administration announced Thursday it had named trade
barriers in Japan, Brazil and India under its massive trade law
enacted last year. U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the
administration will immediately begin negotiations with the three
countries to try to get the barriers removed so that any threatened
U.S. trade sanctions would be unnecessary.
   If the talks are unsuccessful, the U.S. government can levy
tariffs of up to 100 percent against selected imports from an
offending country.
   Mrs. Hills, who made the announcement in Washington, cited Japan
for refusal to buy American-made satellites and supercomputers as
well as its barriers on U.S. lumber products.
   ``This framework, by which the United States forces us to
negotiate by selfishly imposing sanctions, violates the fundamental
idea'' of multilateral trade negotitions under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT, said Hiroshi Mitsuzuka,
Japan's minister of international trade and industry.
   ``We will raise this issue at mutinational meetings,'' Mitsuzuka
added.
   ``Our government is ready to talk about (the matter) at
international levels including GATT. But we would not consider any
U.S.-Japanese bilateral negotiations in the framework of Super
301,'' said Mitsuzuka.
   Foreign Minister Uno said Japan would prefer to solve trade
problems between the two nations ``through quiet talks and joint
cooperation with the United States.''
   In Washington, outgoing Japanese Ambassador to the United States
Nobuo Matsunaga said his government would strongly oppose any
future sanctions.
   ``In light of the good faith efforts that have been made, the
government of Japan and the Japanese people are greatly
disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' Matsunaga said in a
statement. ``There may well be some domestic backlash in Japan
which will make the resolution of the various problems even more
difficult.''

   Striking teachers Thursday approved by
acclamation a contract with a 24 percent pay raise over three years
and more authority for instructors whose walkout crippled education
for a half-million students.
   Teachers will return to the classroom Friday after an 11-day
strike in the nation's second-largest school district.
   ``Our children will have their teachers back,'' Board of
Education member Julie Korenstein said after the board approved the
pact in a 4{-hour close-door meeting.
   ``It's done as far as we're concerned,'' said board member
Warren Furutani.
   The tally of the board's vote was not known, and an official,
public vote was scheduled on June 19. But board member Rita Walters
criticized the contract, and refused to stand with her six
colleagues at a news conference.
   She said the $600 million salary plan for teachers would drain
the budget in other areas. The union has disputed that any cuts
would be needed.
   Teachers union President Wayne Johnson characterized the
settlement as historic.
   ``Things in the Los Angeles Unified School District, as far as
teachers are concerned, have changed for all time,'' a jubilant
Johnson declared minutes before the voice vote by teachers in the
Sports Arena.
   Union members who filled the arena on the strike's 11th day
still had to fill out ballots to satisfy bylaws. But it was
apparent during an hour-long meeting that virtually all points of
the contract, including yearly 8 percent wage increases, were
enthusiastically accepted.
   The board of directors of United Teachers-Los Angeles had voted
to make no recommendation to the rank-and-file on the agreement,
reached early Thursday morning after a 16-month labor dispute in
the nation's second largest school district.
   ``I hope this signals a new era of working together, of
cooperation, rather than confrontation,'' said school board
President Roberta Weintraub.
   Johnson expects the strike to leave no hard feelings between the
union and district, but said a rift would remain between striking
teachers and those who crossed picket lines.
   Teachers had been earning $23,440 to $43,319 a year, depending
on experience and level of education. The new pact raises those
salaries in the first year of the contract to $25,316 and $46,594
and at the end of three years to $29,529 and $53,938 respectively.
   Teachers, whose contract expired in July 1988, will receive a
retroactive pay raise for the first year of the new contract.
   The agreement also provides teachers a greater say in management
by creating councils at each school with half the members from the
teachers' ranks and the other half made up of administrators, other
staff and parents. The district would no longer have veto power on
curriculum decisions.
   The union made several compromises, including agreeing that
teachers work some hours to recover pay docked when they wouldn't
hand in grade reports or perform such duties as yard patrol in
protest actions preceding the walkout.
   Johnson estimated high school teachers were docked, on average,
$1,000 each, and elementary teachers lost up to $700 each.
   Education in the district had slowed to a crawl since the union
representing 22,000 of the district's 32,000 teachers, counselors
and librarians went on strike May 15.
   About half the district's 594,000 students stayed away from
school, going instead to the beach, shopping malls or home. Many of
the students who did attend school encountered more games, cartoons
and film strips than lessons.
   The impasse broke Tuesday after officials on both sides met
privately in Sacramento with state legislators to discuss the
issues and how the district might receive part of a recently
announced $2.5 billion state surplus. Negotiators said the
legislators prodded them to resume talks.

<HEAD>Warsaw Pact Offers Conventional Forces Figures</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Warsaw Pact offered specific ceiling
figures on Thursday for conventional armed forces in Europe, a step
hailed by the United States as ``proof of another positive
development'' at arms talks.
   The East bloc failed to provide figures for Central Europe, an
area where most of the deadly weaponry of both military blocs is
massed. But Bulgarian Ambassador Lyuben Petrov, speaking for the
Warsaw Pact, told a news conference figures for a Central European
zone would be presented ``in the near future.''
   On Tuesday, East bloc proposed at the conventional arms talks
that no nation, including the Soviet Union and the United States,
be allowed to have more than 35 to 40 percent of the combined
manpower totals of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   The moves meet U.S. demands aimed at reducing a large Warsaw
Pact edge over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in
non-nuclear strength. As one example, Soviet tanks now account for
nearly 70 percent of all NATO and Warsaw Pact armor combined.
   Petrov said that in ``strips of contact'' _ or front-line areas
_ of the 16-member NATO alliance and the seven-nation Warsaw Pact,
manpower for each side should not exceed 1 million; strike aircraft
should be limited to 1,100; combat helicopters to 1,300; tanks to
16,000; artillery pieces to 16,500, and armored troop carriers to
20,500.
   These strips of contact for the Warsaw Pact would cover the
Leningrad and Baltic military districts; Poland; East Germany;
Czechoslovakia; Hungary; Romania; Bulgaria; and three other
military districts in the Soviet Union, including Odessa on the
Black Sea.
   For the Western alliance, they include Norway, Denmark, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Luxembourg, West Germany, Italy, Greece and Turkey.
   The new East bloc figures are lower than figures proposed
earlier. Those were: 1,350,000 manpower; 1,500 strike aircraft;
1,700 combat helicopters; 20,000 tanks; 24,000 artillery pieces,
and 28,000 armored troop carriers.
   The Warsaw Pact also presented figures for the six categories in
what the Soviet alliance called rear areas. On the East's side,
these comprise the Byelorussian, Carpathian, Kiev, Moscow, Volga
and Urals military districts. For NATO the rear areas are Iceland,
Britain, France, Spain and Portugal.
   Chief U.S. negotiator Stephen J. Ledogar told reporters at the
news briefing the figures were ``proof of another positive
development and ... we treat and accept (them) seriously.''
   ``We welcome this further elaboration of the East proposals,
(and) we welcome in particular the fact that the (Soviet bloc)
seems to be following the blueprint which the West laid down on
March 9.''
   The complex negotiations on conventional armed forces in Europe
opened in March.
   NATO proposed at that time a limit of 12,000 tanks, 10,000
artillery pieces and 16,800 armored troop carriers for any one
nation.
   It wants weaponry stationed outside one's home country limited
to 3,200 tanks, 1,700 artillery pieces and 6,000 armored troop
carriers in each bloc.
   ``The Eastern numbers are on a number of cases significantly
higher than ours,'' Ledogar said. ``Careful study and detailed
discussion with the Eastern representatives will be necessary
before we can assess the extent to which the latest Eastern
proposals might contribute to our common task.''
   Differences persist. Petrov chided NATO for identifying only
three types of arms.
   The East would like to see attack combat aircraft and
helicopters included in a first phase agreement. The West said it
had not excluded aircraft from negotiations, but felt the best way
to start a phase one agreement was to concentrate on tanks, armored
personnel carriers and artillery.

   House Speaker Jim Wright, in a riveting
spectacle of political abdication, is offering to relinquish his
powerful leadership post in exchange for dismissal of ethics
committee charges that involve his wife.
   Democrats already have begun speaking of a succession in which
Thomas Foley, the majority leader, would move up to speaker as
early as next week.
   ``There is near unanimity of support for Tom Foley,'' Rep. Pat
Williams of Montana said Wednesday.
   Publicly, Wright insisted he would ``press ahead'' with his
defense against the charges in the House ethics committee. At the
same time, he dispatched his lawyers to explore alternatives to
what could be weeks of trying to change the minds of committee
members who brought the charges against him.

   The federal government issued a new AIDS
prevention guide today specifically intended for parents and other
adults to use in counseling young people about the disease.
   ``Too many of our young people are dying from AIDS and unless we
take immediate action the epidemic will continue to spread among
this very vulnerable population,'' said Health and Human Services
Secretary Louis W. Sullivan.
   The new guide is packaged in a folder containing a number of
loose pages bundled in three categories _ one aimed directly at
adults emphasizing the importance of young people learning about
AIDS, one with specific information on the disease itself, and the
third with material written for various age levels that parents can
pass on to their children if they desire.
   The publication is being accompanied by radio and television
public service spots encouraging parents to call the National AIDS
Hotline _ 1-800-343-AIDS _ if they wish to have copies mailed to
their homes.

   A woman's age at natural menopause may be an
indicator of her body's aging rate and general health, according to
a study that suggests women reaching menopause before age 45 may
tend to die earlier.
   Early natural menopause may signal that the body is aging faster
than normal, said co-author David Snowdon of the University of
Minnesota.
   He and colleagues from the university and Loma Linda University
in California presented the work in June's American Journal of
Public Health.
   Other scientists called the work interesting, but cautioned that
its conclusions are limited because of the study's methods.

   Developer Donald Trump says he's ``ready to go''
with upgrading Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle after a judge
approved the $365 million sale of the jewel in the strikebound
carrier's crown.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland on Wednesday approved in
principle Trump's agreement to buy the shuttle after rival suitor
America West Airlines withdrew a $415 million offer.
   Lifland was to hold a hearing today to discuss the sale of the
Boston-New York-Washington shuttle.
   Trump's contract with Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. expires at
midnight Friday. The deal should be closed in about two weeks,
Trump said in a telephone interview.

   White House officials are putting a belatedly
upbeat cast on Moscow's latest weapons-reduction proposal, despite
skepticism voiced by President Bush toward Soviet intentions.
   Bush, in a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy in
New London, Conn., on Wednesday greeted Soviet Leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's latest proposal for conventional arms reduction with
faint praise.
   ``The Soviets are now being forthcoming, and we hope to achieve
the reductions that we seek,'' Bush said.
   But he said Soviet-bloc nations still maintain a ``massive
advantage in conventional forces'' in Europe. He said various
Soviet promises to cut troops and tanks in eastern Europe are ``not
enough'' to erase that superiority.

   The Bush administration is coming under
increasing attack for its plan to build new military reactors in
South Carolina and Idaho that could provide far more material for
nuclear warheads than the Pentagon says it will need.
   The latest barrage of criticism comes from the General
Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress. It said
Wednesday that lawmakers were given inaccurate and incomplete
information about key elements of the plan to build reactors in
South Carolina and Idaho.
   The GAO also questioned whether it was necessary to build the
reactors, which the Energy Department says would provide 150
percent of the anticipated need for tritium, a radioactive gas used
to boost the explosive power of nuclear warheads.
   The administration wants to build one reactor at the federal
Savannah River Site, near Aiken, S.C., and another at the Idaho
National Engineering Laboratory, near Idaho Falls. It says they
could be built within 10 years for $6.8 billion.

   The world's first full-sized nuclear
reactor is eligible to become a national historic site, but some
people wonder if a device that helped kill 40,000 Japanese in World
War II should bememorialized at all.
   ``I believe it has a great deal of historical significance,''
said Bill Heine, manager of the Hanford restoration project for
Westinghouse Hanford Co. ``Anyone in the nuclear industry would
agree to that.''
   There is little question that the crash construction of the B
Reactor during the Manhattan Project was an engineering marvel. It
produced plutonium for the atomic bomb that destroyed Nagasaki on
Aug. 9, 1945. The bomb that fell on Hiroshima three days earlier
was powered by uranium from Oak Ridge, Tenn.
   ``Historians disagree on the importance of the atomic bomb in
bringing an end to the war,'' said Lindy Cater of the Hanford
Education Action League, a Spokane-based citizens' watchdog group.
   ``Different people have different points of view about the
participation of Hanford and what resulted in many deaths at
Nagasaki.''
   B Reactor has been ruled eligible for inclusion on the National
Register of Historic Places, but no nomination has been made.
   What brings the issue to the forefront now is a newly released
draft environmental impact statement on what to do with eight
closed reactors along the Columbia River that produced plutonium
for nuclear weapons. Options range from dismantling them to burying
them where they are under huge mounds of dirt.
   The Department of Energy has scheduled public hearings this year
in Portland, Ore., Richland, Spokane and Seattle. The department
has set a July 28 deadline for comments, but has no specific date
for a final report.
   As an historic site, the reactor would boost tourism, said Dave
Hansen of the Washington Department of Community Development.
``Naturally our position would favor its retention. It's a very
early example of atomic technology.''
   Memorials to war are not uncommon.
   The Enola Gay, the B-29 that dropped the Hiroshima bomb, is
stored at the Smithsonian Institution.
   Bock's Car, which dropped B Reactor's plutonium on Nagasaki, is
on display at the Air Force Museum at Wright-Patterson Air Force
Base in Dayton, Ohio.
   Battlefields around the world where thousands died are now
memorials.
   But none of those memorials are classified as radioactive waste,
as the B Reactor is. And while current generations face little
danger from the Enola Gay or Antietam National Battlefield, B
Reactor plutonium still arms warheads.
   B Reactor has the most historical significance of those on the
Hanford nuclear reservation, and in 1976 was designated a National
Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark by the American Society of
Mechanical Engineers.
   It was the first full-sized nuclear reactor in the world, with
construction beginning a few months after physicist Enrico Fermi
achieved the world's first nuclear chain reaction at the University
of Chicago.
   It was built by 55,000 workers during a fevered 15 months ending
Sept. 26, 1944, as the nation was racing Nazi Germany to build an
atom bomb.
   Today, the control room and the adjacent room where Fermi worked
are still intact. The walls are painted a government green, the
reactor dials are still, and a well-worn operators' manual sits on
a desk. While the reactor vessel is classified as low-level nuclear
waste and must be disposed of, no measureable radiation is emitted
into the visitor areas, Hanford officials say.
   Although Hanford is still a heavily guarded plutonium production
site, the B Reactor is only a mile from the public-access State
Highway 240. A road could be built to the reactor, with the area
behind it fenced off, officials say.
   Already there are some displays showing photos of the history of
the reactor, along with pioneering tools and the giant exposed face
of the reactor, where the nuclear fuel rods were inserted.
   Only about 200 people per year tour the reactor now, according
to DOE spokesman Tom Bauman, who said the agency isn't sure how
much controversy might develop and are waiting to see the results
of the public hearings.
   U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., who represents Hanford, said
he, too, isn't sure of the public response. ``It's important for a
number of us to try and sort out how important B Reactor is to
history.''

<HEAD>UC Faculty Approves Controversial Ethnic Studies Requirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER McNULTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new ethnic studies requirement at the
University of California at Berkeley that includes the study of
European Americans is being heralded by supporters as an important
step in improving campus curriculum.
   Opponents call it ``the hula hoop of the '80s'' _ something that
creates great excitement at the moment but will likely be soon
forgotten.
   ``I think it's the most significant requirement of its kind to
be adopted at any university that I know of because it's based upon
the multicultural heritage of this country,'' said history
Professor Lawrence Levine.
   It sends a signal to schools nationwide that it is important to
examine the ethnic groups that are ``part of the formula that
created America,'' said Levine, a member of the faculty committee
that drafted the proposal.
   Faculty members recently approved the ``American Cultures''
requirement. Beginning in 1991, freshmen and sophomores will have
to take a course on race, culture and ethnicity in American history
and society. Entering juniors or seniors beginning in fall 1993
also will have to meet the requirement.
   The plan calls for study of three of five major cultural groups:
African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans,
Chicano@Latinos and European Americans.
   When a similar proposal without the European American element
reached the Academic Senate in May 1988, a shouting match erupted
and the measure was ultimately sent back to a faculty committee.
   But the compromise addition of Europeans did not diminish all
opposition. Only 20 percent of eligible faculty voted on the final
measure, and some supporters took the turnout as a distressing sign
of apathy.
   ``I think it was a very bad idea, but the political pressure was
very strong to pass it,'' said Hans Sluga, a philosophy professor
who opposed the proposal and boycotted the vote to oppose political
pressure to approve the requirement. He called the idea the ``Hula
Hoop of the '80s.''
   Sluga favored a ``free market approach to education'' that
allows students to choose their own courses. He also criticized the
requirement as too narrowly defined because it focuses on cultural
groups inside the United States.
   ``You could study Chinese in Chinatown but not in China,'' he
complained.
   The intent is ``to incorporate voices that have been left out of
American history, institutions, music and literature,'' said
student body President Jeff Chang, who helped coordinate students
lobbying the faculty.
   Nearly half the 22,671 undergraduates at Berkeleye are white,
slightly more than one-fourth are Asian, about 11 percent are
Hispanic and 7 percent black.
   Advocates agreed that the test of the requirement will be in its
implementation, and Barbara Christian, a professor in the
Afro-American Studies department, acknowledged it will be a
challenge to teach the courses.
   ``The question is whether or not we will be able to do the
necessary work to know the different groups. I think we as a
faculty are going to have to learn a great deal, and there will
probably be team teaching as a result.''
   Proposals include an architecture class to study ethnic
neighborhoods and a linguistics class to study ethnic dialects and
bilingualism.
   Schools across the country are debating plans designed to
highlight the contributions of minorities and women.
   Last year, Stanford University replaced its freshman ``Western
Culture'' requirement with a new course that rejected many classic
works in favor of books by feminists, minority leaders and social
revolutionaries.
   Other University of California campuses, including Santa Barbara
and Davis, are considering mandatory ethnic studies classes, and
Irvine has approved required courses in multicultural studies and
international affairs.
   At Berkeley, some opponents argued that the course is
unnecessary, while others said the campus lacks the needed
classroom space.
   Although UC-Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman, who strongly
supported the requirement, assured faculty members that the campus'
long-term expansion plans include adequate facilities, critics
dismissed the promise.
   Leaders of some minority student groups said the amendment to
include European Americans undermined the intent of the requirement.
   ``We've learned it all our lives,'' said Emily Ihara, chairwoman
of the Asian Student Union. ``I felt like we didn't need to learn
more about it in this class. The whole point is to make up
sometimes for what happens in the classroom.''
   Other supporters said they bowed to political reality when they
endorsed the revised requirement.
   ``We felt we can live with that for the larger purpose of
getting the requirement,'' explained Guillermo Rodriguez, the lone
student member on the UC Regents and an advocate who worked on the
proposal for three years. ``There is also a need to understand some
of the cultures of non-minority or non-Third World people.''
   Rodriguez, 21, a junior majoring in sociology, countered
assertions that the requirement is largely symbolic. ``I think it's
moving in the right direction. I think if it opens one mind, that's
one mind opened and that's good enough.''

   Yes, those creative geniuses who come up with
network television shows have been working overtime to create
fascinating new concepts that will cause you, the loyal network
television viewer, to ignore cable movies, sportschannels and
videocassette rentals and race over hot coals, if necessary, in
order to watch the local network affiliate of your choice.
   Only kidding. Despite proof that their audiences are tuning out,
the networks apparently feel compelled for 1989-90 to cling to
tired premises and spinoffs.
   They apparently hope these will miraculously entice viewers, who
come to the screen for reasons that, despite endless research and
discussion, seem to completely evade network executives still
baffled that ``Lonesome Dove'' won its time period against ``The
Sex Tapes.''
   Oh, but how can you say that? Just look at this innovation on
tap for next season:
   ABC has ``Free Spirit,'' a show about a housekeeper who's a
witch. Now, that's quality entertainment! When's the last time you
saw a television show about a witch? Well, 1972. ``Bewitched.'' Of
course, that was a good 17 years ago, and 17 years is a long time
to go without a show about a witch.
   CBS has ``Wolf.'' This is a show about a cop who was framed and
forced off the force and now works as a private investigator and
hopes to clear his name. Hmmm, sounds suspiciously like ``Private
Eye'' on NBC two years ago.
   Then NBC has ``Sister Kate.'' This is a show about a nun. Yeah,
yeah, ``The Flying Nun,'' 1970. But this is different. This a nun
with an attitude. Sally Field was a cute nun. Very different show.
   Then there's ``Nutt House'' on NBC, a wacky Mel Brooks comedy
about a bunch of madcaps who run a hotel. Sounds a little like
``Fawlty Towers''? Who cares? Nobody watches British TV over here.
   Well, CBS has ``Rescue: 911,'' where you get to see real-life
rescues, so unlike the real-life arrests on ``COPS,'' or
re-creations of real-life crimes on ``Unsolved Mysteries'' and
``America's Most Wanted.'' These are rescues, see?
   ABC's ``Homeroom'' is about an inner-city teacher who uses humor
to get through to his students. ``Welcome Back, Kotter''? No way.
Teacher's name is Harper.
   NBC's ``Baywatch'' is a really unique show about lifeguards.
Oops, even NBC is pushing this show as a reincarnation of
``CHiPs.'' Never mind.
   NBC also has ``Hardball,'' about two cops who are mismatched
partners but eventually form a bond. It goes into the old ``Miami
Vice'' time period. No, no, no, this is not a white cop-black cop
deal. This is old cop-young cop.
   Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner are putting yet another standup
comic in a prime-time sitcom. This time it's Jackie Mason in ABC's
``From This Moment On.'' Well, it is hard to argue with success.
Carsey-Werner's other comics in sitcoms are Bill Cosby and Roseanne
Barr. So it worked _ twice.
   Then there's ABC's ``Living Dolls,'' a spinoff of ``Who's the
Boss?'' And ABC's ``Family Matters,'' a spinoff of ``Perfect
Strangers,'' and NBC's ``Mancuso, FBI,'' a spinoff of the
miniseries ``Favorite Son.''
   As usual, like grass sprouts working their way up through the
concrete, there are a few unusual-sounding shows on the schedule:
   ``Life Goes On'' is about a family with an 18-year-old Down's
syndrome son and stars an actor who has Down's syndrome. It's on
ABC, which put on the unique ``thirtysomething'' last season.
   Hugh Wilson, who created the wonderful ``Frank's Place'' _
canceled, of course, by CBS _ has a new CBS comedy, ``The Famous
Teddy Z,'' about a hot-shot young Hollywood agent.
   ``Frank's Place'' stars Tim and Daphne Reid also found a place
in the new CBS schedule in ``Snoops,'' an hour comedy-mystery that
draws intelligent inspiration from Nick and Nora Charles.
   Steven Bochco (``L.A. Law,'' ``Hooperman'') has a show for ABC
about a 15-year-old medical intern, ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' It
sounds ridiculous, but you can't say it's been done before.

   DALLAS, THE MISSING MINUTES _ ``Dallas'' fans not amused that
``CBS Evening News'' anchor Dan Rather was an uninvited guest star
on last week's season finale can catch the scenes that were
pre-empted for live coverage from China when CBS presents ``Dallas:
The Missing Minutes'' tonight, a 3{-minute capsule synopsis of the
missing parts. Those on the West Coast didn't miss the minutes and
won't get to see the 3{-minute version. ...
   GOOD-BYE GILDA _ ``Saturday Night Live'' host Steve Martin paid
emotional homage to Gilda Radner on the season-ender last week.
Instead of the usual monologue, Martin introduced a tape of their
1978 classic sketch, a fantasy dance sequence that paid tribute to
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, but was set in the shallow and
distinctly un-romantic setting of a '70s discotheque. After the
tape was over, Martin said, ``Whenever I see that tape, I can't
help thinking how great you looked _ and how young I was. Gilda,
we're going to miss you.'' The show went on as usual, except that
bandleader G.E. Smith, Radner's ex-husband, wore a black armband.

<HEAD>The Origins of Entrepreneurs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The origin of entrepreneurship _ the
overwhelming desire to create an original, inventive course in life
no matter what the risks _ seems to become mistier rather than
clearer with each new study.
   Among claims is that the seed can be found in economic or
psychological deprivation, in a newspaper route, in a rural
environment, in a youngster's age relative to siblings, in having
had a mentor, in having moved while a child.
   Most claims can be made to sound reasonable. Deprivation may
spur ambition. Newspaper routes teach self-reliance. Rural
economies offer an understandable microcosm of larger economies.
Mentors show the way. Moving arouses curiosity.
   Perhaps there is some truth in such assertions, and at least a
bit also in some of the other claims, legends and myths that
surround the subject. Neither can you dismiss the role of venture
capitalists, who supply the wherewithal.
   Seldom, however, are teachers given much credit, but of late
there is no denying their role. From grammar school to graduate
school, individual teachers _ entrepreneurs themselves _ have
accepted the assignment of showing the way.
   In many instances, the spur to these teacher-entrepreneurs has
been the very failure of the educational system to tackle the job.
Even now, youngsters may go through school without ever considering
the self-employment option.
   At the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, Professor
Irvin B. Tucker III faced the problem by investing his own money to
establish Tucker Press in 1987. His purpose was to produce a high
quality economics textbook.
   Keeping costs to a minimum, he published ``Economics For Young
Americans,'' along with a teacher's guide. The State of North
Carolina adopted the text last year for a five-year period. The
book has sold thousands of copies.
   For his work, Tucker received a $15,000 award from the Freedoms
Foundation, Valley Forge, Pa., a non-profit, non-sectarian,
non-political organization that seeks to foster an understanding of
American freedoms and opportunities.
   For 12 years the foundation has honored educators who seek to
teach the rewards and risks of the free enterprise system, of which
entrepreneurship is one of the most dramatic expressions.
   Among those honored this year were Sister Mary Adelaine of Notre
Dame Academy, Los Angeles, who structured a course on ``Wall
Street-Main Street,'' and Terry Applebaum of Northwestern
University, who seeks to develop among artists an appreciation of
business, the better to pursue their careers.
   Steve Mariotti was discovered teaching in New York's Jane Addams
Vocational High School. His course, ``South Bronx Entrepreneurial
Education Program'' encouraged several black and Hispanice students
to found businesses.
   Gay Burden Ferguson, economics teacher at McLean County High
School in rural Calhoun, Kentucky, was honored for putting her
class to work developing and producing a marketing video and
brochure to lure businesses into the area.
   Entrepreneurs, teachers included, aren't the kind who easily
turn down money. But one thing is known for sure about this breed:
their primary motive isn't cash but the development and fulfillment
of ideas.
   Twenty-one teachers in all were honored with cash gifts, but the
big payoff may come later.
   That payoff would be if they helped produce a Sam Walton, as in
Wal-Mart Stores, a Steve Jobs, as in Apple Computer, an An Wang, as
in Wang Labs, or a Fred Smith, as in Federal Express.

<TEXT>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Subject: El Paso Intelligence Center.
   Mission: Collect and share with law enforcement agencies
information on drug-, weapon- and alien-smugglers.
   Number of arrests: None.
   ``Our first task is tactical intelligence _ that which the field
agents can use to cause an arrest or seizure,'' says William
Norsworthy, director of the center at Fort Bliss that publishes its
phone number but reveals little else.
   EPIC might tell the Coast Guard where to find a specific
marijuana-laden ship off the Florida coast. Or it might tell the
Texas Department of Public Safety who a certain smuggler hangs
around with.
   But it looks farther downrange, too.
   ``What's going to happen two years from now in what part of the
world? We try to figure that out,'' said Norsworthy.
   At EPIC, representatives of 10 federal agencies gather evidence
and piece together a criminological jigsaw puzzle that displays
drug smugglers and other criminal organizations. The law
enforcement consortium doesn't make seizures or arrests and doesn't
take credit for the arrests it produces.
   ``They are our primary source of intelligence,'' said Jim Bowen,
senior tactical coordinator for Operation Alliance, an El
Paso-based union of federal agencies that chases and arrests drug
smugglers along the U.S.-Mexican border. He declined to recount
specific cases in which EPIC information resulted in large-scale
busts.
   EPIC started out in 1974 as the Southwest Border Intelligence
Service, with 35 employees from the Drug Enforcement Administration
and the Immigration and Naturalization Service working in cramped
quarters.
   Four years later it had a congressional mandate, a new name, 106
employees from six federal agencies and 16,000 square feet of space
in central El Paso.
   Now the 15-year-old intelligence network occupies a brand-new,
57,000-square-foot building on Fort Bliss, where 200 employees of
the DEA, INS, Customs Service, Coast Guard, Marshals Service, FBI,
Internal Revenue Service, Federal Aviation Administration, Secret
Service and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms labor 24 hours
a day.
   Some of those agencies have been known for fierce turf battles,
but Norsworthy said that's rare at EPIC. ``It's pretty unique in
that we all get along good. After 90 to 120 days, agents lose their
agency identity and become part of EPIC.''
   EPIC gives Operation Alliance ``threat assessments'' _ dossiers
on illegal organizations, along with when and where they are
expected to operate next. It prepares similar assessments for the
Miami-based Lightning Operations Center, which tries to keep drug
shipments out of southern Florida.
   Other information goes to the agencies making up EPIC, the lead
law enforcement agencies in 50 states, the District of Columbia,
Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands and Samoa. It gets upwards of
300,000 inquiries a year.
   Usually, when police ask for information, EPIC asks why.
   ``Something made someone make that call _ either he saw or heard
something,'' Norsworthy said. ``We ask for that information, and we
build on that. We look for patterns and trends all the time.''
   Bits of information can be assembled like a puzzle: an ID number
on the tail of a plane, a series of large cash bank deposits and
the sighting of a suspect could start an investigation ending in an
arrest and seizure.
   Sometimes it turns out that different police agencies are
investigating the same organization but aren't aware of each other.
In those cases, EPIC brings the agencies together and helps plot
investigation strategies.
   Some of the information comes from those cases. Other times,
member federal agencies contribute. Some data come from FBI and DEA
offices abroad.
   Each agent working at EPIC is limited to the investigative
methods his or her agency is permitted under U.S. law; a wiretap,
for example, would require a court order.
   If there's any criticism of EPIC among law enforcement agencies,
it's that the center's computer system needs to be upgraded.
   ``Just bring them up to the state of the art,'' Bowen said.
   U.S. Rep. Ron Coleman, D-Texas, represents the district where
EPIC resides. A few years ago, he helped fight off a proposal to
move it to Washington. Now he would like to improve its computers.
``My goal is to make it the absolute state-of-the-art
intelligence-gathering center in the country,'' he said.
   Just how advanced the computer and communications systems are is
a secret. Norsworthy isn't telling, but he said a police agency
calling EPIC probably will find the information it wants on a
suspect.
   ``If he's ever been the subject of an investigation or an
associate of someone who's been the subject of an investigation,''
he said, ``chances are pretty good.''

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II is coming to
Scandinavia where Roman Catholicism, vanquished by the Protestant
Reformation, was proscribed for more than 300 years until a century
ago.
   The pope will spend 10 days in Norway, Iceland, Finland, Denmark
and Sweden, starting June 1.
   Overwhelmingly secular and affluent, Scandinavians, especially
the young, show little patience with traditional moral standards.
   Attitudes toward sex are liberal and marriage is optional. In
Sweden, for example, the statistics bureau said last year that some
50 percent of all couples living together don't bother to exchange
vows. The figure is higher in Iceland.
   Couples who register as cohabitants have virtually the same
legal rights as do man and wife.
   In Sweden and Denmark, homosexual couples have equal rights.
   Birth control is encouraged. Abortions occur at a rate of about
20 per 1,000 women, while slightly lower in Finland. An abortion is
available without questions to any woman above the age of consent
up to the 12th week of pregnancy.
   In the era of AIDS, condoms are distributed in many schools and
advertised on billboards.
   ``We are in a helpless situation,'' said Ake Goransson, director
of studies for the Roman Catholic diocese in Sweden.
   ``We have many Catholics who don't marry, not because they are
afraid they won't be able to divorce, but because marriage is just
not common in Sweden.''
   Swedish Catholics, a community of 135,000, had only 260
marriages last year.
   The Scandinavian dioceses run education classes, usually on
Saturdays, to teach the Vatican's position on such questions as the
sanctity of marriage and the purpose of sex.
   ``We have a broad program of Christian education for our kids so
they can make their own decisions,'' said Goransson. ``The church
doesn't want to tell Catholics what to do. You must follow your own
conscience, but your conscience must be taught.''
   The pope was expected to speak on issues of man's faithfulness
to God and to each other, and parental responsibility, said
Goransson.
   To one degree or another, the Lutheran Church is an arm of the
state in all five countries. About 90 percent of the populations
belong to the official tax-supported churches.
   Membership in the state church is automatic for anyone born of
Lutheran parents. Clergymen are civil servants paid by the state,
and bishops are appointed by government.
   But religion plays little role.
   In Sweden, about 10 percent say they are regular churchgoers. In
Norway, cities are virtually shut down for the Easter holiday while
Norwegians go skiing.
   Some say Christianity never really took root when it came to the
Viking cultures 1,000 years ago.
   The Benedictine monk Ansgar brought Christianity to Denmark and
Sweden in the 9th century, but it took two centuries to spread
throughout Scandinavia.
   Danish chroniclers say a monk called Poppo convinced King Harald
Bluetooth of Christianity's power by carrying a red-hot iron in his
hands in the year 960.
   The Roman church came to Finland by way of an English-led
crusade in 1155. It vied with the Orthodox Church from Russia,
which still has a strong foothold.
   The 16th-century Protestant Reformation was the tool for the
Scandinavian kings to seize church property and the wealth of what
had become a powerful force. In Sweden, the church owned one-fifth
of all farms.
   For one brief period in Denmark, being Catholic was a capital
offense.
   Freedom of religion was restored throughout the region in the
19th century, and today Catholics are a small but growing minority.
   A liberal policy toward refugees in Sweden, Norway and Denmark
has brought Catholics, mostly from Chile in the last several years.
Thousands also came from Poland after the labor unrest that began
in 1980. In the 1950s others came from Hungary and elsewhere in
eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Under Economic Gun, U.S. High Schoolers Are Thinking Japanese</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL HIRSH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Not far from the corporate towers of Manhattan,
where an older generation jostles daily with foreign competitors,
Michael Rubin's high school students are itching to get into the
game.
   These teen-agers aren't thinking softball at the local park in
Queens. They want to play economic hardball. So they're doing what
comes naturally in the business-minded 1980s _ they're studying
Japanese.
   Throughout the United States, the study of Japanese and other
so-called ``exotic'' languages such as Chinese and Russian, once
the preserve of colleges, is booming in high schools, junior high
schools and even on the elementary level, educators say.
   As global economic forces shift from what was once blithely
called the ``American Century'' toward what some have dubbed the
``Pacific Century,'' American youth are going with the flow,
delighted educators say.
   ``I took (Japanese) because I see Japan as the next Pacific
power,'' said Alwin Eversley, a bony, bespectacled 15-year-old who
makes it plain he respects economic muscle. Like many students in
Rubin's class at Townsend Harris High School, Alwin plans to be a
business major in college.
   ``A lot of businessmen in America, they don't speak the language
of Japan well,'' he said. ``And so the Japanese are not influenced
by them that much. They look down upon them a little.''
   While new interest in Russian and Chinese has been spurred by
liberalization in the Soviet Union and China's rapid social
changes, and Arabic is on the rise, the biggest surge in high
school language study has been in Japanese, said C. Edward Scebold,
executive director of the American Council on the Teaching of
Foreign Languages.
   Educators say years of media lamentation over the
uncompetitiveness of U.S. industry marked not only businessmen, but
also a business-oriented younger generation.
   ``Every time a student turns around, there's either a Japanese
product or an article in the paper about Japan. It's like a
built-in P.R. program,'' said Fred Lorish, a teacher of Japanese at
South Eugene High School in Oregon.
   In a high school in Battle Creek, Mich., officials were
astonished when they offered a Japanese class in the only slot
available _ 7 a.m. _ and 28 students showed up. In Bloomington,
Ill., Japanese studies blossomed after Japan's Mitsubishi and
Chrysler Motors jointly opened a plant last October. In New York
state, junior high schools will be authorized to offer Japanese for
the first time next fall.
   California, Oregon and Washington now proudly consider
themselves the eastern bulwark of the bustling Pacific Rim and have
embraced Japanese business and culture.
   ``I don't want to sound corny and say the future's in the
Pacific Rim, but it's true,'' said Tanya Renee Hamlin, a
15-year-old freshman at Franklin High School in Seattle.
   Oregon, which had an early taste of Japanese power when its
coastline was bombed by Imperial Navy submarines in World War II,
has sponsored a virtual invasion since 1980. The state has gone
from one high school with 15 students of Japanese to 26 schools
with nearly 1,700 students this year.
   In 1988, Oregon began the nation's first full-time grade 1-6
immersion program in Japanese, in which students are taught
subjects half the day in English and half in Japanese, said David
Arlington of the state Department of Education.
   ``There's definitely a correlation between the rise of the yen
and the rise in interest in Japanese,'' said Rubin, 44, a New
Yorker who lived in Japan for five years and studied at Keio
University. ``I think money talks.''
   The National Governors Association concluded as much when its
task force on international education issued a critical report this
year.
   ``The international frontier is no longer the future _ a new age
has arrived,'' said the task force's chairman, Virginia Gov. Gerald
L. Baliles.
   ``International education, teaching and learning about other
countries, their citizens, and their languages _ just how important
is it to our country? As important as economic prosperity, national
security, and world stability,'' the task force report said.
   But old habits die hard. Only one in five American high school
graduates takes more than two years of any foreign language,
according to a 1987 Department of Education study. Not one state
requires a foreign language for a high school diploma.
   Probably fewer than 500 Americans can speak Japanese fluently
today, said Seiichi Makino, a visiting professor of Japanese at
Harvard University. By contrast, Japanese children begin studying
English intensively in junior high school.
   With the exception of the West Coast states and Hawaii, most of
the high school Japanese programs have started in the last seven
years. About 270 high schools in 35 states offer Japanese, a jump
of 50 percent from just two years ago, according to the Center for
Improvement of Teaching of Japanese Language in High School, based
in Urbana, Ill.
   ``I think communities around the country are beginning to see
there's a real economic advantage to communicating in Japanese.
They want to attract Japanese businesses,'' said Carol Bond,
director of the center.
   But more powerful forces than mere economics are at work,
teachers say. U.S. preeminence has ebbed, and Japan has eclipsed
the United States as the world's largest creditor and supplier of
foreign aid.
   ``My sense of the kids I teach is that there is a real, almost
subconscious desire to be international, to be part of it,''
Lorish, the 45-year-old Oregon teacher, said. ``What I didn't have
in the '50s is the sense that my language is a passport to the
world. These kids have it.''
   There are problems, of course. Like any new demand, the language
boom has outstripped supply _ in this case that of qualified
teachers and adequate textbooks, teachers say. Few states offer
certification in Japanese.
   ``We get the same message from teachers over and over again.
They don't know if they're doing things right,'' Bond said.
   Because of the difficulty of the language, there is also a high
dropout rate, teachers say. According to the State Department's
Foreign Service Institute, it takes 1,320 hours of Japanese study
to reach the same level of speech attained in 240 hours of Spanish
or even Vietnamese.
   Interest in foreign languages has been cyclical in the past, but
Scebold of the foreign language council believes the latest upswing
may be more permanent.
   ``There is a realization in the minds of citizens that we've got
to push kids into these programs. ... God knows, those languages
open a million doors.''

<DATELINE>MOUNT AYR, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At the Randy Bishop home in the heart of
south central Iowa's parched cattle country, the well has been dry
since September and hauling water has become routine.
   So has wearing clothes longer between washings for Bishop, his
wife, Christine, and three young children, turning off the shower
between lathering up and rinsing and leaving to Mommy the decision
on when to flush the toilet.
   Farming is now even more of a gamble in the stunted pastures
nestled amid roller-coaster hills along the Iowa-Missouri border,
where rainfall has been less than 50 percent of normal since
January 1988.
   There were a few generous showers in May, allowing newly planted
corn and soybeans to sprout, raising spirits and turning pastures
green. Farmers now say that with a few more timely rains, they may
have enough moisture to raise corn stalks tall enough to chop up
for silage to sustain their cattle, even if there's not enough rain
for the crop to mature and be harvested.
   ``I'm not sure we can catch up in one year and get back to even
halfway normal,'' says Bishop as his pickup truck bumps across a
pasture seven miles south of Mount Ayr. G I mow it, there's
nothing to rake up.''
   Normally, the Memorial Day Weekend is when farmers begin to
harvest the first of several cuttings of the hay crop.
   ``I don't know when it's going to be this year,'' Smith says.
   Smith, 65, remembers his father surviving the Dust Bowl years of
the 1930s without electricity and air conditioning.
   ``It seemed hotter in the '30s. But it certainly didn't last as
long,'' he says.
   Average rainfall in Iowa from May 1988 through the end of April
1989 is 22.08 inches, 10 inches below normal and nine inches less
than the same period a year earlier that led up to the Drought of
1988.
   At Blockton, total rain from Jan. 1, 1988, through the end of
April came to 16.86 inches, just 40 percent of the normal 41.91
inches for that 16-month period and the lowest of 162 official
measuring sites in the state.
   Blockton Mayor Richard Melvin had to scramble up to the roof of
his plumbing supply business to make repairs after a recent rain.
``We didn't have enough rain to go through the cracks before
then,'' he said.
   The National Guard has been hauling water for household use to
one southeast Iowa community and eight in south central Iowa since
May 8. Four of those cities are around Blockton.
   Although Blockton's municipal well is deep enough to ensure
water supplies to the community's 120 households, most surrounding
farms are in trouble and some farmers are traveling almost 80 miles
roundtrip to haul water.
   ``Last year the wells went dry, but we had ponds. Now the ponds
are going dry,'' Melvin said.
   In Corning, where water shortages following droughts in the
mid-1970s led to the development of ample water supplies, water
sales to individuals are up sharply.
   The municipal water works has a coin-operated machine that
dispenses 50 gallons of water for 25 cents. Sales, which totaled
about 25,000 gallons in all of January 1988, ran above 535,000
gallons this month, says Dean Davis, director of the municipal
utility. About three-fourths of those sales are for household use,
and farmers also have been buying water for mixing with chemicals
to control insects and weeds.
   When there is rain, it immediately is soaked up in the loose top
inches of the soil, never reaching deep enough to be stored for the
rest of the growing season or to flow into depleted farm ponds and
rivers.
   Davis, checking on the installation of new street lights, said
6-foot deep holes revealed bone-dry earth below a narrow band of
moist topsoil.
   That is a major worry.
   Subsoil moisture is deemed 100 percent inadequate throughout
south central Iowa.
   In last year's drought, it was ample subsoil moisture at the
start of the planting season that enabled many farmers to avoid
being wiped out.
   ``The lack of water is more scary than the lack of feed,'' Smith
says. ``Everyone's trying to hang on. But everybody I talk to says,
`When I run out of water I'm getting rid of them (cattle).'''
   So far, there's been no rush to liquidate breeding herds.
   But at the rural Corning farm of Ralph Neill, productivity
records on each cow are being reviewed to decide which ones to send
to the slaughterhouse if feed becomes scarce.
   The 51-year-old farmer, whose family has been working the remote
fields since 1875, says he knows such action is risky.
   ``If I don't save replacement heifers, every year the average
age of the cows gets one year older and you get in a perilous
situation,'' he says.
   He used to wait for a truckload of cattle before making the trip
to market to sell the weakest stock from his herd, but this day, he
was preparing to sell four cows that had lost calves.
   With feed scarce, there's no excuse for keeping marginal stock
on hand, he says.
   Cattlemen in the drought area say the May rains have been enough
to keep them going another 30-45 days even if no more rain falls.
   But many veterans say they've made their cutbacks early.
   Bill Henderson, a fifth-generation farmer near Clearfield who
says nine of his 14 ponds have run dry, reduced his herd by 25
percent a year ago.
   ``You make contingency plans way in advance,'' says Henderson.

   ``Once you have seen the sky, you cannot go back into the well.''
   Spoken with the simple eloquence of an old sage, the words were
uttered by a 23-year-old Chinese woman yearning for freedom in her
homeland.
   Lee was our guide, one of three on a visit to China. My husband
and I went with the idea that we would find a lock-step society
cautious about change. We found, among the educated middle-class
Chinese we met, an intense desire for reform, a hunger to learn
everything about Western culture and society, a disillusionment
bordering on contempt for the old guard running the nation, and a
fierce determination to better their lives through individual
initiative.
   Now, like millions of others around the globe, we're glued to
the televised images of turmoil in Tiananmen Square and along the
Bund in Shanghai.
   Of all of the faces that we saw in February, of all the faces of
hunger strikers and peasants and workers and intellectuals
dominating the television screen and the front page today, three
remain distinct in our memories: Lee in Kunming, Charlie in Xian,
and Louie in Guilin.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Lee is a lovely young woman, daughter of factory workers,
youngest of four children, a former college teacher who is
determined to have her own travel business one day. She lives in a
single room and eats cafeteria-style with other employees of the
travel office where she is the beginner.
   She dresses in Western-style clothes, simple and inexpensive,
and likes bright colors. Every day for five days she wore her red
shoes. When we asked her to forget the regular tour and take us to
the places she liked, she took us to the city park to watch old men
play card games in the sun, children chase ducks, lovers canoe on
the lake. We strolled the formal camellia gardens as we tried to
explain mortgages and credit.
   We sat at a restaurant table for hours as she demanded to know
everything about the U.S. Senate. She quoted Jefferson and was
curious about FDR and the New Deal. What was John F. Kennedy really
like? She asked us to recite the preamble to the Constitution and
made us feel ashamed when we stumbled through it.
   One starry night she guided us from tiny, cold-water apartments
to tinier, no-water apartments on the campus of the local art
institute and music conservatory.
   In one artist's garret we heard him extol, through Lee's
interpreting, the wonders of Tibet, the trouble it takes to put on
a modern art exhibit under the watchful eyes of the Chinese
authorities and the thrill of exchanging views with an artist, my
husband, from America.
   As we left after tea and heady conversation, he pressed on the
American painter a luminous watercolor of the Himalayas, saying:
``I was starving and hallucinating when I painted that picture. I
had no food and no money and I was stranded in Tibet. I want you to
have this to remember me by.'' As if anyone could forget him.
   In another concrete apartment, lit with a glaring overhead bulb,
we sat transfixed as a 14-year-old prodigy played Mozart on a
Chinese piano under the gaze of a plaster Beethoven bust. The boy
was recuperating at home because, while studying in Beijing, he'd
become malnurished and contracted pneumonia in his poorly heated
dormitory. His concentration, his technique, his passion at the
keyboard transcended language and hemispheres. We burst out in
applause and ``Bravo! Bravo!'' as he humbly bowed his head and
apologized for ``my inadequacy to play this master.''
   We left Lee on the tarmac as she prepared for her yearly exams
``which qualify me to escort our honored foreign visitors.'' She
haughtily refused a tip but was giddy as a schoolgirl with the few
humorous stickers and lapel pins we pressed on her.
   ``Please send me postcards, and pictures of your town,'' she
said shyly. ``And a book you think will get past the censors.''

   Charlie's 32 and hip. He wears Reeboks and has a VCR. But he
lives in a one-room unheated apartment in a city where it snows a
lot. He said he opted not to have a heater in his home because he'd
rather spend his precious income on ``other things _ books, tapes,
movies, traveling.'' Besides, grinned the newlywed, ``I've got my
love to keep me warm.'' His wife works in a factory office. They
say they will have to wait several years before they can afford a
baby. Currently they are saving for new bicycles.
   Charlie dreams of going to the United States, of seeing Madonna
in concert, of learning about the hotel business in California and
returning to China to make money as an innkeeper. ``Tourism is our
future. Everybody will want to come to see China as we open up.''
He says he's lucky, because he's traveled inside China and now
knows how beautiful other parts of his country are.
   The day he took us to see the 2,000-year-old terra cotta army
the three of us stood alone and stared together at one of the
wonders of the world. Charlie urged us to study an ancient clay
face, to imagine what the man who posed for the statue was like,
how he lived, what he thought. He forced us to contemplate our own
link with Emperor Qin Shi Huang, the first person ever to unite
China, in 221 B.C.
   Then we turned to stare into Charlie's face, and we saw the past
in the present.
   And we all decided it was too cold to stand around watching our
breath freeze. So we retired to the coffee shop at the new Holiday
Inn and talked politics, economics and art. Charlie asked us if
California was as wonderful as he'd heard, and we hedged our
answers about smog and gridlock as we waxed poetic about orange
blossoms and Hollywood.
   Revived by strong coffee and frank talk, we then moved downtown
to a main street, through an unmarked lobby, up three flights of
unlighted stairs and into a smoke-filled room ablaze in flashing
red spotlights. There, to the music of the Miami Sound Machine
blasting from an ancient stereo system, we watched a Western-style
fashion show as pencil-thin models paraded down a runway lined by
serious, unsmiling men and women in Mao jackets puffing on strong
cigarettes. The clothes were terrific, the setting straight out of
Fellini.
   When we left town we gave him a baseball cap and promised to
somehow send a few Michael Jackson tapes. Our last memory was of
him waving, somewhat forlornly, as we passed stern-eyed customs
agents.
   ``Try to help me go to America,'' he called, ``and don't forget
to write.''

also for fun.''

suffered greatly in the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and '70s.

   The Red Guards rampaged through his city, as they did nearly
everywhere in China, and his parents were sent from the university
to the countryside to be ``re-educated.'' Just as China's last
emperor, Pu Yi, was forced to wear a dunce cap and parade through
the streets in shame, so was Louie's father. It is a bitter memory.
   ``That is where the students jumped to their deaths,'' he said,
pointing down from a rocky promontory into a small, manmade lake on
a college campus. ``They refused to surrender to the madness, so
they killed themselves.''
   In much of Louie's speech there is a hint of melancholy. It is
there as he tells us _ strangers _ that his mother is terrified the
Red Guards will come again, and that he must never share his life
or his secrets with outsiders, he must never trust strangers, he
must never, ever, criticize the authorities.
   But Louie is a 30-year-old husband and father whose family is
victimized by rampant inflation. He knows that in his classless
society there is a privileged elite and a thriving black market. He
knows, from the BBC and the Voice of America, and the stories from
friends who've been to Hong Kong, and his own too brief, bungled
trip to study in Alaska, that a whole new world lies beyond China's
borders.
   ``We cannot go back to bound feet and Mao's caves,'' said Louie.
``I want to earn money, have my own house, be free to travel, raise
my child to go to college. I want better furniture, someday maybe
even a car, an impossible dream now. I want to read more books and
see American movies. I don't want my parents to be afraid of
speaking out. China is changing, we can never go back. Today we
wear a new face.''
   His wife is a teacher who works solely to pay for the food his
infant son needs.
   One of his greatest joys is a Sunday outing when he takes his
wife and child down to the river to see the rock that looks like an
elephant's trunk. There, on a sandy beach, fledgling entrepreneurs
sell ice creams and fruit ices, balloons and toys. Perhaps Louie
will draw a picture, or contemplate one. His wife might recite
poetry to him. His baby will giggle and coo, just as babies
everywhere do.
   ``Send me books by your best writers,'' he said. We asked, ``You
mean Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway?''
   ``I don't know them,'' he replied. ``Just send anything you
like, and I will like it, too.''

   USAir is swapping its red and brown logo for a
more refreshing red, white and blue one, airline officials said
Wednesday.
   USAir will scrape the old paint from all its 429 jets within the
next two years and replace it with a new logo that includes the
airline's name in the new colors on the fuselage.
   The tail will be painted blue with ``USAir'' in white letters
between red stripes.
   USAir Chairman Edwin Colodny said it will cost $7,000 to paint
each plane.
   ``We all need to refresh ourselves periodically with a new suit
of clothes or a new dress,'' Colodny told reporters and airline
workers at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.
   The present logo was designed in 1975.

   The fuel-economy standard for 1989 passenger
cars will remain at 26.5 miles per gallon, the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration said in rejecting a petition for
reconsideration of the regulation.
   The petition filed by two Washington-based advocacy groups, the
Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen, asked NHTSA to allow the
corporate average fuel economy standard to revert to 27.5 mpg, the
level set by a 1975 law intended to reduce dependence on foreign
oil.
   The advocacy groups failed to make a case that ``the standard
should have been set at a level other than 26.5 mpg,'' NHTSA's
order said Wednesday.

<HEAD>Delay in Robins Plan Confirmation Frustrates Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dwindling number of women injured by A.H.
Robins Co.'s Dalkon Shield birth control device still hope to bear
children if they can get reconstructive surgery, the leader of a
victims' rights group says.
   But they are frustrated waiting for court approval of Robins'
bankruptcy reorganization that has delayed distribution of money
for surgery, said Linda Hightower, director of the Dalkon Shield
Victims Association.
   ``Every day we delay is another day that the women who have even
the smallest chance of having a child lose that chance,'' she said
Wednesday. ``A lot of women are losing heart.''
   Robins pulled the Dalkon Shield from the market 15 years ago but
resolution of claims has dragged on.
   A reorganization plan including a $2.5 billion trust fund for
Dalkon Shield claimants was approved in July 1988 by judges in U.S.
District Court and U.S. Bankruptcy Court.
   The plan called for Richmond-based Robins to be acquired by
American Home Products Corp. of New York in a $700 million exchange
of stock with full payment of creditors.
   During the appelate process, $100 million of the $2.5 billion
trust fund has been available to compensate women with minor Dalkon
Shield injuries or poorly documented claims. The bulk of the fund
awaits final confirmation of the reorganization plan.
   An appeal of the plan was heard on an expedited basis by the 4th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last December but no decision has
been handed down.
   ``We're sitting on pins and needles expecting it at any
moment,'' said Guerry Thornton Jr., attorney for the Atlanta-based
victims' association.
   Thornton and other lawyers involved in the case said they had
expected a ruling earlier because of the delays and because
American Home can withdraw from the plan if it is not finalized by
July 26, one year after its initial confirmation.
   Robins spokesman Roscoe Puckett said American Home officials
have given no indication they plan to exercise their option to back
out of the deal.
   ``I have to believe in my judicial system and believe they're
trying to do the right thing,'' Ms. Hightower said. ``I hope the
justices realize how important it is.''
   Robins' filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in August
1985 came 11 years after it pulled the Dalkon Shield birth control
device off the market. About 4.5 million of the intrauterine
devices had been distributed in the United States and abroad.
   At the time of the Chapter 11 filing, Robins had paid about $520
million to settle more than 9,000 damage lawsuits, and faced
thousands more from women who said they suffered injuries including
infections, sterility, miscarriages and children with birth defects
because of their use of the Dalkon Shield.
   About 94 percent of the 200,000 women with injury claims against
Robins voted in favor of the reorganization plan, but lawyers for
the appealing claimants challenged the way the vote was taken and
the amount of the trust fund.
   The fact most of the claimants voted in favor of the plan
increases frustration over the appeal's delay, said Stanley K.
Joynes III, a Richmond lawyer appointed to represent future Dalkon
Shield claimants.
   ``There's a fair amount of resentment that the appeal was even
filed, that a handful of people are holding this up,'' he said.
   Lawyers representing claimants said millions of dollars in
potential interest are being lost because the trust fund money will
not be deposited until appeals to the plan are exhausted.
   ``If the trust had the money today and invested it at current
rates, it would be earning $800,000 a day,'' Joynes said. ``That's
the real loss. That's what the appeal is costing the Dalkon Shield
claimants, and the court's aware of that.''

   It takes a memorable advertisement to grab
the attention of the average American, who sees about 80 television
commercials nightly.
   But even the funniest, most creative, entertaining ad isn't any
good if it doesn't sell the product, says the man who headed a
campaign that made people nationwide think that ``Virginia Is for
Lovers.'
   David N. Martin, chairman of a Richmond ad agency and author of
``Romancing the Brand,'' says the sales pitch is absent from
today's increasingly entertaining advertising.
   ``In the last four or five years there has been a return among
advertising agencies to really high creative _ very witty, very
charming and very entertaining ads,'' Martin, whose book has a
publication date today, said in an interview this week.
   But too many advertisers try to imitate commercials run by
market leaders, he said.
   The makers of Pepsi and Levis jeans can barely mention their
products in ads because their name recognition is so high. But
other companies mistakenly believe awareness is sufficient and they
don't tell consumers why to buy their products.
   ``They try to overwhelm the consumer strictly through
entertainment,'' Martin said. ``It doesn't work with a low share.
There are ways to be wonderfully witty, wonderfully entertaining
and not lose sight of the product.''
   Cable television, videocassette records and television remote
controls have increased viewing options and made competition for
consumers' attention increasingly fierce, he said.
   Escalating television and print advertising costs mean companies
can't run as many ads, putting a premium on getting viewer or
reader attention with a dramatic advertisement.
   Finally, advertising artists and writers are creative people who
like their ads to be talked about and to win awards, Martin said.
``Creative people don't put selling as first priority,'' he said.
   Good ads have ``a magical third dimension'' that gets them
talked about and makes them part of common culture, such as the
California Raisins or Wendy's ``Where's the Beef?'' slogan, Martin
said.
   ``Somewhere embedded in the customer's mind is a fact or belief
about every brand that can be converted into a memorable idea by
skilled advertising,'' he said.
   Before co-founding Hawley Martin Partners in Richmond last year
with his brother Steve, Martin was chairman of The Martin Agency,
named one of the nation's ``hottest'' agencies by Advertising Age
and Adweek magazines in 1987.
   Martin said he wrote ``Romancing the Brand'' after hearing
advertising professionals complain about the erosion of the
industry and companies' substitution of promotions and coupons for
advertising.

<HEAD>Scientists Challenge Companies' Lock on Software Programs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of the nation's top computer
scientists are challenging big companies they claim are trying to
gain control over parts of computer programs as fundamental as
steering wheels and pedals on cars.
   A handful of computer firms have filed lawsuits asserting they
are entitled to copyrights over the ``look and feel'' of popular
computer programs, including widely used commands, menus and
displays.
   ``If there were copyrights like this on cars, then every
manufacturer would have to give you a different way to steer,''
said Richard Stallman, a 36-year-old programmer at the
Massaachusetts Institute of Technology.
   ``If you learned to drive a Ford, you wouldn't know how to drive
Chevrolets. Some cars would have throttles, others would have
joysticks, and each manufacturer would have to find a new way of
doing it,'' he said.
   Shouting slogans such as ``Hey hey, ho ho, software tyranny has
got to go,'' about 150 MIT professors and students picketed
Wednesday outside the computer firm Lotus Development Corp.
   The protesters, including programmers from Boston-area companies
and some top computer scientists, say the firms are trying to gain
permanent control over computers' most fundamental conventions.
They've mounted a grass-roots campaign against companies suing over
programming.
   The rash of lawsuits includes complaints filed by Apple Computer
Inc. against competitors Microsoft and Hewlett Packard Co., and by
Ashton Tate against Fox Software.
   Lotus, which makes the best-selling computer accounting program
Lotus 1-2-3, is suing competitors Paperback Software International
and Mosaic Marketing Inc.
   Lotus and some other software companies contend that unless
their products enjoy strong copyright protection, they will not
have an economic incentive to develop new programs.
   ``Our argument is that out-and-out copying of other people's
work stifles creativity and innovation,'' said Lotus spokeswoman
Betsy Kosheff. ``Copyright law allows you to take other people's
work and build on it, but not to steal it.''
   Copyright lawyers said the rash of ``look and feel'' lawsuits
began in late 1986, after a federal judge in California ruled that
a small software company, Unison World Inc., had infringed a
competitor's copyright on a program for making customized greeting
cards.
   Since then, several companies have won similar cases, but ``each
case, rather than settling the law, has tended to unsettle it and
raise more questions,'' said Thomas M.S. Hemnes, a partner in the
Boston law firm of Foley, Hoag &amp; Eliot.
   The MIT protest grew out of an advertisement placed in an MIT
student newspaper last month by Stallman; Gerald J. Sussman, a
professor of electrical engineering; and Marvin Minsky, founder of
MIT's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
   They warned that the lawsuits could freeze out new companies,
make computers harder to use and, ultimately, retard the industry.
   ``Until quite recently, people invented things, everybody gave
each other all their software, we had fun and people made money
anyway,'' Sussman said Wednesday. ``I'd like to see that come
back.''
   Stallman, a prominent programmer who developed EMACS, a widely
used system for editing computer programs, said it is in the public
interest to have computer programs share basic attributes, so users
do not have to learn each program from scratch.
   The lawsuits, he charged, will lead to ``inefficiency and
gratuitous incompatibility,'' with ``a heavy cost for the economy.''
   Protesters said they have formed a new organization, the League
for Programming Freedom, to try to pressure Lotus and other firms
to drop the lawsuits.
   In leaflets handed out at the pickets, the group urged people to
boycott the firms bringing the lawsuits and to buy competing
products instead. They also advised programmers not to go to work
for Lotus, Apple and Ashton Tate.

<HEAD>Executives: Cable, Networks To Cooperate More</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The differences between cable television and
over-the-air broadcasting will fade as networks seek more revenues
and cable systems look for more programming, industry executives
say.
   With statistics showing that cable television expansion has
reduced network share of the TV audience to about 70 percent from
highs above 90 percent, networks have begun crossing over into the
cable industry.
   NBC Chairman Robert C. Wright, whose top-rated broadcast network
has formed cable alliances and its own cable channel, told an
industry conference Wednesday that NBC will continue to invest in
cable-delivered products.
   Wright said some affiliates were unhappy with the network's
cable ventures, but added: ``We're a program company and our
business is to be involved in programs that appear in people's
homes.''
   Between 52 percent and 55 percent of the nation's television
homes take cable, with an average bill of $14.40 a month.
Subscriber revenue has climbed from $969.5 million in 1976 to an
estimated $13.8 billion last year.
   ``Today the fact of the matter is that if you simply look at one
channel as the only way to deliver something that is attractive to
a home viewer, you are substantially limiting your horizons,''
Wright said.
   ``We think we have capabilities and resources and appetite to
serve lots of different viewer needs,'' he said.
   NBC last month launched CNBC, its own cable news and information
network. NBC also has programming agreements with the Walt Disney
Co., which operates The Disney Channel.
   Frank Biondi Jr., president of Viacom International Inc., said
some cable operators were angry when his company syndicated the
popular show ``Double Dare,'' which had been a key ingredient of
Viacom's Nickelodeon cable channel.
   But Biondi said ratings for cable broadcasts of ``Double Dare''
have risen as the syndication has neared the end of its run.
   John Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc., the nation's
largest cable operator, said operators must ``take the long view''
about cooperation between cable and over-the-air networks,
especially in creating new programming.
   But Wright said differences will remain, principally because of
the networks' ability to reach broad, general interest audiences.
   Wright, a former president of Cox Cable Communications, said NBC
will generate most of its income from network television for years,
``but we are going to continue to invest in other ways to reach
other viewers.''

   Limits on steel imports have helped change the
fortunes of U.S. steel producers, but industry executives say
nothing has changed about the way other nations behave in
international trade.
   ``There is no fair trade in steel, especially among the 29
countries currently operating under the (Voluntary Restraint
Agreements),'' Bethlehem Steel Corp. Chairman Walter F. Williams
said Wednesday. ``Each and every one of them is currently trading
unfairly in the U.S.''
   ``We have the documentation to prove it,'' he said at the annual
conference of the American Iron and Steel Institute.
   Domestic producers are prepared to file trade lawsuits against
virtually all of the United States' trading partners without an
extension of the five-year VRA program, Williams said.
   President Bush is expected to fulfill a campaign promise to
extend quotas past their Sept. 30 expiration. But steel executives
are concerned he may impose the second round of VRAs for less than
five years or otherwise weaken the restraints.
   After a slow start in October 1984, the VRAs are now limiting
imports to around 20 percent of the U.S. market.
   The U.S. producers said no nation should be allowed to ship
steel to the United States without restriction, as Australia,
Mexico and Korea have requested.
   Even Canada should be included, they said, although most steel
producers seem to be trying to abide by an understanding that
Canada will claim no more than 2.5 percent of the U.S. market.
   Political realities make it unlikely Bush will demand a quota
agreement from Canada, the United States' largest trading partner,
said Thomas C. Graham, outgoing AISI chairman and president of USX
Corp.'s steel division, the largest U.S. steelmaker.
   Williams cited examples of alleged illegal trade practices:
   _``Italy is bailing out their state-owned steel company for the
third or fourth time, frankly I've lost track, to the tune of about
another $4 billion,'' he said.
   _Indonesia plans to give $425 million to save a steel rolling
mill that is partially government owned. Imports of Indonesian
steel are not restricted, and shipments have risen from virtually
nothing several years ago to 265,000 tons in 1988.
   ``They're planning to triple their steel exports over the next
decade,'' Williams said.
   _Acesita, a government-owned specialty steel producer in Brazil,
is negotiating for a 70 percent expansion in its production
capacity primarily for export, Williams said. Brazilian steel
capacity already far exceeds domestic needs.
   _U.S. producers suspect the Australian government cut a deal
with its steelmakers. In exchange for private investment in steel
plants the government would shield the domestic market from imports
and ``pay bounties to Australian steel consumers for the spread
between the higher domestic and lower foreign price.''
   ``Our information is that the Australian government, starting in
1984, has paid out up to $64 million a year in these bounties,''
Williams said.
   ``And British steel has been privatized as of last fall and now
declares itself debt free and ready to take on all comers ... after
their government converted $12 billion of debt into $4 billion of
equity for an estimated $8 billion loss,'' he said.
   Last year, Canada shipped 3.2 million tons of steel to the
United States; Brazil, 1.37 million tons; South Korea, 1.3 million
tons; France, 1.24 million tons; Mexico, 471,200 tons; Italy,
326,200 tons; and Australia, 282,000 tons.
   Steel importers say the U.S. government also subsidized steel
production through unemployment compensation to laid off workers
and in defaulted loans.
   But U.S. companies say such financial support pales by
comparison to foreign government ownership and investment in steel
production.

   Steelmakers have lowered production costs by
routing out featherbedding work rules. Now they would like to see
the same done in the construction trades on which they depend.
   ``The construction industry must begin to eliminate such work
practices as a day for travel time, excessive coffee breaks,
overmanning, a lack of any right to subcontract and rules which
permit workers in one craft to sit idle with pay until those in
another finish their jobs,'' said Thomas C. Graham, chairman of the
American Iron and Steel Institute.
   Some companies that contract for construction services also are
at fault, Graham said Wednesday.
   ``A major offender ... appears to be the public utility
industry, where too often excessive construction costs can merely
be passed along to the consumer,'' Graham said during the
institute's annual meeting.
   Steelmakers have spent an estimated $9 billion on new plants and
equipment since 1982 and they worry about construction costs as
they plan for continued modernization, he said. Steel plants also
require frequent maintenance construction
   Construction costs were nearly uniform around the world 20 years
ago, but U.S. steelmakers today spend up to twice as much as
foreign competitors on the same project, Graham said.
   Steel companies last year negotiated with the AFL-CIO for a 10
percent discount off prevailing labor rates whenever they used the
labor group's members exclusively on construction jobs. But
pipefitters are not honoring the deal in the Chicago area, he
claimed.
   ``The kind of controls on wage rates which we've seen in steel
must begin to be applied in the building trades,'' Graham said.
``Chicago-area pipefitters have received total employment cost
increases since 1982 of 27 percent up to $25 an hour while those in
the steel industry came down over the same period.''
   Average steel industry labor costs, including wages and all
benefits, declined from a record high of $26.90 an hour in November
1982 to $24.50 an hour during the first quarter of 1989.

<HEAD>Three Former First Jersey Securities Indicted for Money Laundering</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three former First Jersey Securities brokers
have been indicted in an alleged $1 million money laundering scheme.
   The brokers, working out of the firm's Paterson and Cherry Hill
offices, allegedly hid from the Internal Revenue Service money that
was given to them by brokerage customers, U.S. Attorney Samuel A.
Alito Jr. said.
   In two indictments returned Wednesday by a federal grand jury,
the former brokers also were charged with conspiring to defraud the
IRS by preventing the brokerage firm from reporting large cash
payments, Alito said.
   Indicted were Kevin O'Donohue, 31, of Cherry Hill; Arthur
Basmajian, 30, of Pittsburgh, formerly of Cherry Hill; and Dominic
Padula, 46, of Paterson.
   If convicted, O'Donohue faces up to 35 years in prison; Padula
faces up to 20 years in prison; and, Basmajian faces up to 15 years
in prison, Alito said. They all could face fines of $500,000, Alito
said.
   He said Basmajian and O'Donohue were brokers at the Cherry Hill
office, and Padula worked at the Paterson branch.
   Under IRS regulations, cash transactions of more than $10,000
were required to be reported to the IRS on a form identifying the
person making the payment.
   The IRS uses the information to reveal various illegal
activities, including drug transactions and tax evasion, Alito said.
   The indicted brokers allegedly helped customers conceal the cash
from the IRS by having First Jersey employees convert cash deposits
into cashier's checks at local banks, in amounts less than $10,000.
Those checks were then returned to the brokerage and deposited into
the customers' accounts, according to the indictment.
   Alito said all the men are expected to receive summonses and be
arraigned within 10 days. He said there were no plans to indict the
customers, but he added the investigation is continuing.
   ``Simply by handling an account of this nature, a broker can
earn commission as the customer buys and sells stocks,'' he said.
   All three of those indicted specifically are charged with
conspiracy. In addition, O'Donohue is charged with six counts of
money laundering, Basmajian is charged with two counts of money
laundering, and Padula is charged with three counts of money
laundering.

<HEAD>Dow Chemical Official Critical of National Bottle-Deposit Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM BOVEE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Congressman from Michigan defends his
national bottle-deposit bill, described by an industry opponent as
too narrow, as a first step toward more extensive recycling efforts.
   Rep. Paul Henry, R-Mich., said Wednesday that nearly 80 members
of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors of his bill, which would
require all states to collect a deposit on beverage containers. The
bill is modeled after Michigan's bottle-deposit law.
   ``If you put a deposit on a bottle or a can, you'll get that
container back for recycling, but you won't get other materials
back,'' said Karl Kamena, director of governmental and public
affairs for the plastics department of Dow Chemical Co.
   ``I don't think the grocery stores should be in the garbage
business,'' Kamena said. ``I think we can do better by developing
an infrastructure that has curbside pickup, making it much easier
for the consumer.''
   Kamena, also chairman of the Council of Plastics and Packaging
in the Environment, a coalition of Dow and other large
corporations, said obtaining a supply of used containers for
recycling into other products was a top priority but didn't believe
bottle-deposit laws were the best way to meet that end.
   Henry said arguments such as those used by Kamena ``sometimes
are used quite frankly as an attempt to subvert taking that first
step.''
   He said he supported curbside-pickup efforts ``to the extent
that they're honestly motivated rather than attempting to derail
those forms of recycling that have proven effective.''
   Kamena said efforts to reduce solid waste, in part through
improvements in packaging, had resulted between 1970 and 1986 in an
8 percent decline in the number of pounds per capita of containers
and packaging discarded and not recycled.
   Members of the council, ``who make up the key players in the
packaging and plastics industry, feel that given this trend,
increased recycling and incineration of waste materials are far
more promising solutions to our disposal problems than simplistic
laws attacking packaging,'' Kamena said.

<HEAD>Penn Central Scouting for Acquisitions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Penn Central Corp., still hunting for a big
acquisition, has enough money to launch a multi-billion-dollar
takeover, says company chairman and Cincinnati financier Carl
Lindner.
   Lindner told shareholders Wednesday that Penn Central has plenty
of cash to finance a major acquisition.
   ``Penn Central continues to have great financial resources,'' he
said. ``We have over $1.8 billion in shareholders' equity.''
   The Cincinnati-based telecommunications and defense firm is 31
percent owned by Lindner's American Financial Corp.
   Lindner clearly spelled out the company's intentions at last
year's annual meeting, but also said at the time that he was in no
hurry to make a deal.
   ``Last year I said there was no sense of urgency to make any
move,'' he said. ``That is still true today.''
   Although shareholders' equity is approaching $2 billion, the
company's debt is only $220 million.
   At the end of 1988, Penn Central had cash, temporary investments
and marketable securities of $1.16 billion.
   The company has $1.3 billion in net operating loss
carryforwards, which are past losses that can offset future income
to reduce taxes. Acquisitions could produce higher earnings and
help maximize the benefits of the carryforwards.
   ``Penn Central is capable of doing a $5 billion or $6 billion
transaction, especially if Henry Kravis (of leveraged buyout firm
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.) can do a $25 billion RJR Nabisco
deal with only $1 billion,'' said Lindner.

<HEAD>Airline Says it Gains Even Through Trump Is Getting Eastern's Shuttle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   America West Airlines ended up withdrawing its
bid for Eastern Airlines' Northwest shuttle, but the Phoenix-based
carrier says it came out ahead nonetheless.
   ``The publicity is worth far more than we expended,'' said Mark
Coleman, an America West vice president. ``We literally could not
buy the positive awareness we've received.''
   A federal bankruptcy judge in New York on Wednesday approved in
principle developer Donald Trump's agreement to buy the shuttle for
$365 million after America West pulled out.
   America West said it withdrew its offer after failing to arrange
financing terms it considered acceptable before a Wednesday
afternoon deadline set by Eastern.
   ``We came very close, but ultimately, the lack of time was the
deciding factor,'' America West President Mike Conway said in a
statement.
   Conway, who has spent the past two weeks in New York working on
the proposed deal, also said the airline was impeded by financing
terms it considered unacceptable.
   America West, which formally announced its plans to bid for the
shuttle on May 3, actually had a pair of offers on the table.
   The company had offered $415 million for the shuttle and $336
million for 10 Boeing 757s. Or, America West would have bought the
shuttle's gates and landing slots at three airports for $375
million but no aircraft.
   Coleman, senior vice president of sales and product development
for America West, said the airline remains interested in buying 10
Boeing 757 jets from Eastern for $336 million.
   Paul Karos, airline analyst with First Boston Corp. in New York,
said America West generated some publicity in the East, where the
airline is not well-known but where it is strengthening service.
   Karos said that although America West is highly leveraged, it
appeared to be in a position to line up financing because of the
profitability of the shuttle operation.
   ``From an America West point of view, it's only a long-term
opportunity cost that is lost,'' he said. ``I thought initially the
shuttle would be dilutive to their earnings, but that in the
long-term it would be a nice return for the company.''
   Coleman said he doesn't believe that America West's failure to
secure financing impairs the airline's reputation.
   ``Quite the contrary, we don't think anybody in the financial
community was not taking us very seriously,'' he said. ``It's not a
question of, `Who are those guys?' We were a serious contender. The
people in the financial community know that.''
   The unsuccessful bid does not affect the airline's plans to
strengthen service to the East Coast with the start-up of flights
by July 1 to New York's LaGuardia and Washington National airports,
Coleman said.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Atlanta businessman has received a $2 million
award in what officials called one of the largest awards in a
securities arbitration case.
   A three-member arbitration panel of the National Association of
Securities Dealers ruled Monday in favor of Dennis M. Crean, the
same man who was awarded $1.24 million by a federal court jury a
year ago in connection with the same investment program.
   Crean contended he lost more than 41.7 million in four days when
he invested in a complex stock options program in 1984.
   NASD said local stockbroker Thomas W. Alison and his New
York-based employer, PaineWebber Inc. are liable for Crean's losses.
   Crean's lawyer said his client lost all the money he invested
during a stock market rally in August 1984. He filed a lawsuit the
following December.
   Attorney George W. Fryhofer III said Alison advised Crean to
invest in a speculative strategy known as a ``variable hedger''
program.
   Fryhofer said Alison represented the program as ``low- to
moderate-risk'' investment and said Crean could not lose more than
15 percent of his investment.
   A spokeswoman for PaineWebber said Alison and PaineWebber both
declined comment on the case.
   As reported earlier this week, an Atlanta woman was awarded $3.1
million in another securities case.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Share prices were higher at midday Thursday in
quiet trading following the release of British trade figures for
April which were in line with expectations.
   The market climbed to its morning high in the minutes following
the late morning release of the April report, then sagged a bit for
lack of continuing buying interest.
   Traders said the initial buying appeared to have come from
market makers who had been short of stock ahead of the report.
   ``They bought on the chance that there might be some interest
after the figures. But there wasn't,'' said a dealer at a major
London brokerage firm.
   The current account deficit widened to 1.66 billion pounds ($2.6
billion) in April from 1.19 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) in March.
Expectations had been on average for a deficit of about 1.6 billion
pounds ($2.5 billion).
   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 6.1 points, or 0.3 percent, at 2,138.8,
though 3.2 points below its best level reached five minutes after
the trade report. The market had been as much as 6 points below its
Wednesday close near the opening.
   Volume was a modest 278.0 million shares at midday, compared
with 306.9 million shares at the same time Wednesday.

   Britain's merchandise trade deficit widened to
2.16 billion pounds ($3.4 billion) in April, from 1.68 billion
pounds ($2.7 billion) in March, the government said Thursday.
   The Department of Trade and Industry said the current account
deficit widened to 1.66 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) from 1.18
billion pounds ($1.9 billion) a month earlier.
   The current account includes ``invisible trade'' such as
services, overseas investment earnings and official transfer
payments. The government estimates that Britain's invisible trade
was in surplus of 500 million pounds ($790 million) in April.
   The figures nearly matched expectations.
   Since the beginning of 1989, Britain's merchandise trade deficit
came to 8.0 billion pounds ($13 billion), compared with a deficit
of 5.4 million pounds ($8.5 billion) a year earlier.

   A modest 2.7 percent rise in mid-May car and
light truck sales may indicate a softer-than-expected market and
force two of the Big Three automakers to extend incentive programs,
analysts say.
   The eight major automakers assembling vehicles in North America
reported Wednesday they sold cars and light trucks at an average
daily rate of 39,360 from May 11-20 compared with 38,334 in the
same 1988 period.
   Analysts expected an increase, mainly because many incentives
expired May 11 last year. Customers planning to buy cars in mid- or
late-May 1988 made their purchases early to take advantage of the
deals, which reduced sales in the period.
   ``I don't know what it's going to take to bring customers back
to the showrooms,'' said analyst Mary Anne Sudol of Fitch Investors
Service Inc. in New York. ``I think demand is just tired at this
point.''
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler Corp. and some
overseas automakers had wide-ranging incentive plans in effect this
month to lure people into showrooms.
   But demand may not be there, said Tom Webb, a senior economist
with the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   ``Basically, what sales have shown is that the underlying demand
is less than what most people expected,'' he said. ``Given those
sales, there's going to have to be some further (production) cuts.
They would be modest though.''
   Automakers often trim their inventories through incentives and
production cuts.
   Speculation that Ford and GM need to continue incentives past
their expiration dates during the next two weeks grew with
Wednesday's sales reports. Said Webb: ``There's no doubt about
that.''
   Ford spokesman Bill Carroll said he expected another, more
limited incentive package to be announced May 31, when the
company's current program expires.
   Most of GM's program ends June 5, but on Wednesday, the
corporation's Pontiac Division announced a wider selection of cars
qualifying for cash rebates or low-interest financing. GM also
boosted the cash offer on a few Pontiac cars.
   Chrysler's program continues indefinitely.
   The incentive programs were prompted by slower-than-anticipated
sales during the first three months of the year.
   Since New Year's Day, car and truck sales by the eight makers
were running 3.6 percent behind the pace for 1988, the second-best
year in automotive history. Car sales were running 5.4 percent
behind and truck sales were down 0.3 percent.
   Ford sold cars at an average daily rate of 7,616 during the May
period, compared with 7,410 last year, a 2.8 percent increase. Car
sales so far this year were 0.5 percent behind last year.
   Ford's mid-May truck sales were 6.1 percent higher than last
year and 2.9 percent slower for the full year.
   GM said its cars sold at a daily rate of 11,895 during mid-May
this year, up 2.6 percent from 11,592 last year. GM's year-to-date
car sales were down 9.6 percent. Truck sales in mid-May were up 4.6
percent and down 0.1 percent for the entire year.
   Chrysler said its cars sold in mid-May at a daily rate of 3,378,
0.2 percent ahead of the 3,372-car-per-day rate last year. So far
this year, the No. 3 automaker's car sales were running 15.6
percent behind last year's rate.
   Chrysler truck sales were off 6.4 percent in mid-May but were
0.4 percent ahead of the pace for the full year.

<TEXT>
   A federal court ruling that upheld the
constitutionality of Wisconsin's anti-takeover law was a victory
for Universal Foods Corp. in its fight against a hostile
acquisition bid.
   Attorneys were notified Wednesday that the law, which prevents
successful bidders from swiftly selling newly acquired assets, was
upheld by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago.
   The law had been challenged by High Voltage Engineering Corp., a
company owned by New York investors who began a campaign last year
to buy a controlling share of Universal stock.
   In a 21-page decision, Judge Frank H. Easterbrook said
``Wisconsin's law may well be folly; we are confident that it is
constitutional.''
   Clifford Press, deputy chairman of High Voltage, said his
company would review its options in light of the ruling.
   ``The court found that although the statute may well be economic
folly, it is constitutional,'' Press said. ``While not deciding the
poison-pill case, the opinion does cast serious doubt on
Universal's `just-say-no' defense. In light of the court decision,
we are reviewing our options.''
   The Legislature enacted the law to help Wisconsin companies ward
off hostile takeovers. Easterbrook said it requires a successful
bidder to wait three years before completing a merger or acquiring
more than 5 percent of the Wisconsin company's assets unless the
company has agreed to the deal.
   ``As a practical matter, Wisconsin prohibits any offer
contingent on a merger between bidder and target, a condition
attached to about 90 percent of contemporary tender offers,'' he
said.
   Easterbrook said he and Judges William J. Bauer and Hubert L.
Will questioned whether the law is fair to shareholders because
tender offers are a way for investors to bypass company management.
   The prospect of takeover ``induces managers to run corporations
more efficiently,'' he said.
   ``Skepticism about the wisdom of a state's law does not lead to
the conclusion that the law is beyond the state's power, however,''
he said. ``Unless a federal statute or the Constitution bars the
way, Wisconsin's choice must be respected.''
   Universal presidernt Guy A. Osborn, who has urged shareholders
not to accept the High Voltage offer, said his attorneys told him
``that we are the first company in more than four years that has
been successful in staying independent.''
   High Voltage had offered to buy Universal stock at $38 a share,
a deal valued at about $750 million.
   The law was previously upheld March 18 by Judge Joseph P.
Stadtmueler of U.S. District Court in Milwaukee.

   Top business economists today predicted that
economic growth will slow dramatically this year but the nation
should be able to forestall a recession until at least 1990.
   The consensus of 54 forecasting experts surveyed by the National
Association of Business Economists was that America will experience
a ``growth recession,'' in which the economy continues to expand
but at a very slow pace.
   The slowdown is expected to be accompanied by a moderate
increase in unemployment and higher inflation due to an emerging
upturn in food and energy prices, according to the association's
latest quarterly survey.
   1990 continues to be the year economists predict a recession
will arrive. Forty-three percent predict a downturn then, while 20
percent expect record peacetime expansion to end this year.
   That projection is slightly more optimistic than the group's
last quarterly forecast, issued in February, when 75 percent of
those surveyed expected a recession this year or next.
   In today's survey, 17 percent forecast a recession for 1991 and
20 percent said it would be 1992 or beyond before a downturn occurs.
   Recent government reports measuring the economy's performance so
far this year have suggested that growth is slowing in response to
a Federal Reserve campaign to engineer a so-called ``soft
landing,'' in which the economy slows enough to cool inflation
without slipping into a recession.
   But the forecasters warned that ``the real trick from an
economic policy perspective is preventing the forces that are
responsible for a major slowdown from degenerating into a fullblown
recession.''
   ``Soft landings have often appeared possible ... but inflation
has invariably worsened,'' the group said in a summary of its
findings. ``With the run-up in prices, government policy has been
forced to squeeze still harder and soft landings are lost in the
process.''
   The analysts' median forecast was that the gross national
product, the broadest measure of the economy's health, would grow
at an sluggish annual rate of 1.3 percent during the final three
quarters of 1989.
   For the year overall, the GNP was forecast to grow 2.8 percent,
down from 3.9 percent in 1988. Growth was expected to slow even
further in 1990, dropping to 1.8 percent.
   That prognosis is considerably more pessimistic than the Bush
administration, which is pinning its budget and deficit-reduction
plans on GNP growth of 3.2 percent this year and next.
   The government reported today that the GNP grew at a 4.3 percent
annual rate in the first three months of 1989, much slower than
previously thought. The pace was a lackluster 1.8 percent when a
statistical bounceback from last year's drought is excluded.
   Jay N. Woodworth, president of the business economists' group,
said the new GNP report reflects a downward revision in the amount
of inventories held by businesses, which bodes well for the economy.
   Woodworth said that were the group's economists polled today,
they ``might be just a trace more optimistic'' than they were when
the survey was conducted earlier this month.
   The overall slowing of the growth predicted in the forecasters'
survey was expected to reflect a sharp slackening in key sectors of
the economy:
   _Growth in industrial production was forecast at 3.2 percent in
1989 and 1.8 percent in 1990, down from 5.7 percent last year.
   _Construction of new homes and apartments was projected at 1.41
million units in 1989 and 1.44 million in 1990, compared with 1.49
in 1988.
   _Car and truck sales were forecast to slip to 14.9 million for
this year and next, down from 15.9 million in 1988.
   The economists also forecast that the slowdown in economic
growth would be accompanied by an increase in the unemployment rate
from a 15-year low of 5 percent in March, averaging 5.4 percent for
all of 1989 and 5.8 percent in 1990.
   Inflation, which advanced at a sharp 6.6 percent pace in the
first four months of 1989, was expected to peak midyear and then
become more moderate. Price increases were forecast to average 5.3
this year and 4.7 percent in 1990, up from 4.4 percent in 1988.
   Progress on the country's twin trade and budget deficits,
meanwhile, was expected to continue over the next two years, but at
a slower pace.
   The median trade deficit forecast was $112 billion for 1989 and
$100 billion in 1990, down from $119.8 billion in 1988. The slower
pace of improvement was linked to expectations of a drop in net
exports from $99.1 billion in 1988 to $90 billion this year and $76
billion in 1990.
   The budget deficit, which reached $155.1 billion in 1988, was
pegged at $160 billion for 1989 and $140 billion in 1990. That
would exceed the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets of $136
billion and $100 billion for this year and next, respectively.
   The economic slowdown also was evident in the economists'
forecast for personal consumption expenditures, which account for
two-thirds of overall economic activity. Consumer spending was
expected to grow by 2.5 percent this year and 1.9 percent in 1990,
down from 2.8 percent in 1988.

   Nintendo Co. Ltd. spent most of its 100-year
history producing playing cards with the cherry blossoms and cranes
of traditional Japan. Now its trump card is a modern computer game
that is the best-selling toy in the United States.
   The top Japanese maker of home computer video games reported
$1.7 billion in U.S. sales in 1988 alone and is believed to have at
least a 75 percent hold on the American market for the high-tech
toys.
   NEC Home Electronics, a U.S. subsidiary of Japanese computer and
telecommunications giant NEC, announced last Tuesday it has devised
a superior home video game system that will go on sale in the
United States this fall. But Nintendo executives say they're not
worried.
   For nearly a century, Nintendo was literally a house of cards _
until the 1970s, its main products were playing cards for a
traditonal Japanese game called hanafuda, as well as ones used in
Western card games.
   In the 1980s, the company of 690 employees nestled in a green
valley in Japan's ancient capital, Kyoto, began making toys with
audio visual features using micro-computers. Last year, only three
years after introducing its games in the United States, the
Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) was the No. 1-selling toy
there, according to Toy And Hobby World magazine.
   In late April, the company released its newest computer toy,
``Game Boy,'' a pocket version of the NES system, in Japan. It will
go on sale in the United States this summer. ``Game Boy'' has an
8-bit microprocesser that can be used with a variety of game
cartridges.
   Consumers _ and they are not only kids, Nintendo says _
apparently are ecstatic over games called ``Super Mario Brothers
2'' and ``Zelda II.'' They devoured ``The Legend Of Zelda'' last
year, and snapped up ``Mike Tyson's Punch-Out'' as soon as it hit
toy-store shelves.
   Nintendo spokesman Hiroshi Imanishi says the games originally
were developed from the premise that Japan's contemporary kids are
miniature versions of their workaholic parents.
   What with hectic schedules of school, after-school schools, and
other lessons, they required games they could play alone, indoors,
and within a short period of time.
   ``Considering all the pressures of children's schedules, we
searched for something they could play for 30 minutes to an hour
and walk away with a sense of excitement and satisfaction,''
Imanishi said.
   Those who follow the fortunes of video game makers say
Nintendo's success stems from its control over licensees who
develop many of the hundreds of games that can only be played on
Nintendo consoles.
   ``Nintendo was able to put out enough different titles (of
games) that it made people want to have the hardware,'' said Rodney
Harada, an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in Tokyo. ``And Nintendo
controls so much of the hardware market that software developers
have to go through it.''
   In the United States, some of Nintendo's competitors are crying
foul over this arrangement. The company is the target of a $250
million lawsuit by Atari Corp., of Sunnyvale, Calif.
   The antitrust lawsuit, filed in February, alleges that Nintendo
forbids its developers to sell adaptations of their games to other
video game companies. Nintendo says the allegation is frivoulous.
   ``Atari has filed this lawsuit because of its lack of efforts to
expand its own market in computer games,'' said Imanishi.
   Meanwhile, Nintendo reported sales for the first half of its
fiscal year ending in February totaled 188 billion yen or $1.4
billion, up 47.1 percent over the same period the previous year.
   A recent survey of 1,000 publicly traded Japanese companies
showed that Nintendo stocks had risen more than 80 times in value
over the last 14 years _ by far the largest jump in value among any
of the companies surveyed.
   Its games also have been a phenonenon at home, where the video
system is called the ``Family Computer.'' As of March, however, the
United States surpassed Japan as the biggest consumer of its
consoles.
   More than 13 million consoles have sold in each country _ at
about $112 in Japan, where consumer prices are among the highest in
the world, and an average U.S. price of $80.
   Enough Nintendo game cartridges _ 160 million _ have been sold
in Japan to supply every Japanese man, woman and child _ with 40
million left over. About 75 million cartridges have been sold so
far in the United States.
   Last year, 97 percent of Nintendo's revenues came from sales of
computer games in both countries, and Imanishi says 95 percent of
the company's efforts are channeled into developing new games for
the console. But the company is not worried that its explosive
success could fizzle.
   ``We are creating entertainment, and that is a timeless concept
that doesn't change,'' Imanishi said.
   For the future, Nintendo is developing software that will allow
its computer console owners to trade stocks and do their banking at
home. They are also seeking ways to appeal to consumers beyond the
10- to 17-year-old males who are now their biggest customers.

<TEXT>`Designer' Animadepartment's Agricultural Research Service to highlight
some of the possible changes that agency scientists see over the next 25
to 50 years. Some were described Wednesday in a preliminary report.  
 ``Of course, there re no guarantees that what the scientists envision
will become reality,'' said R. Dean Plowman, administrator of the research
agency. ``But based on the research they're involved in right now, it's
certainly within the realm of possibility.''    One of the prospects is
a computerized listing of genetic codes for producing livestock with specific
characteristics such as disease resistance, says Robert J. Wall, an animal
physiologist at the agency's reproduction laboratory at Beltsville, Md.
   Researchers already have the chemicals for the basic gene structures
and have a machine that can recreate the desired gene, he said. The missing
ingredients are the blueprints for putting them together, the genetic codes
that determine all living things.    ``We can read the alphabet of
specific genes, although only in the last 10 years have we been able to
do this with genes from higher organisms,'' Wall said. ``We know the words,
but we don't know the syntax of the sentences. There may be 100 genes involved
in eye color. We have to learn not just what they are, but how they work
together.''    The report said growing broiler chickens in a closed environment
would eliminate infectious diseases in the flock and boost the growth efficiency
of the birds, since none of the feed energy would be needed for warmth.
   Steers might be able to thrive on woody plants and forages if researchers
can find a microorganism that can break down the lignin, or binder that
holds fibers together. Or they might be able to ``borrow a gene from termites
and insert it in a microbe that already lives in the ruman (ttomach) of
cattle,'' the report said.    In the poultry sector, breeder hens might
be developed which could ``double their current rate of 140 chicks per
year'' through artificial insemination, it said. Also, the industry
might use dwarf breeder hens to lower feed costs.

   A new report by the Agriculture Department
says prices of farmland nationally are going up for the third
consecutive year and may rise more than many analysts were saying a
few months ago.
   The farmland forecast was included Wednesday in a report on
agricultural income and finance by the department's Economic
Research Service. It said values ``continue to rise and could
advance 7 percent to 9 percent this year.''
   A tentative forecast made last December called for a farmland
value gain this year of around 2 percent to 4 percent.
   The agency announced last month that farmland values, including
buildings, rose nationally in 1988 by 6 percent to an average
nationally of $597 per acre, the second consecutive increase.
Farmland prices sank to a 19-year low of $548 per acre in 1986
before turning up in 1987.
   ``With real estate now accounting for about three-quarters of
the farm sector's total assets, movements in land values
dramatically affect net worth,'' the report said. ``Coupled with
stable debt, higher land values could add $40 billion to the wealth
of the farm sector.''

   Preliminary signup figures released by the
Agriculture Department show that farmers are putting millions of
idled crop acres back to work this year.
   Under this year's programs, farmers will idle 29.2 million
acres, little more than half of the 54.2 million acres contracted
to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs, officials
said Wednesday.
   Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idled
acreage would still represent an area larger than the state of
Pennsylvania.
   To be eligible for federal price supports and related benefits,
farmers are required to take a percentage of their base acres from
crop production and put the land in conservation uses that help
protect the soil.
   Last year's drought cut production severely, triggering higher
grain prices and a drain on U.S. stockpiles. The department eased
idling requirements for this year's crops in an effort to rebuild
inventories.
   The idled or ``diverted'' acres signed up for 1989 included:
corn, 10 million acres, down from 28 million signed up for 1988;
sorghum, 2.8 million acres, down from 4.1 million; barley, 2.1
million acres, down from 2.9 million; and oats, 300,000 acres,
unchanged.
   In all, feed grain acres signed up to be idled under the 1989
programs totaled 15.2 million acres, down from 28.2 million
contracted last year.
   Additionally, wheat farmers signed up to idle 9.5 million acres
this year, compared with 22.8 million acres in 1988; cotton, 3.4
million acres, up from 2.1 million; and rice, 1.1 million acres,
unchanged.
   The USDA report said farmers enrolled 168.1 million acres of
feed grain, wheat, cotton and rice in the 1989 program, which
represented 76.3 percent of the 220.3 million acres in the national
base area for those crops. The idled acres are part of the 168.1
million acres that were enrolled.
   Last year's gross enrollment was 187.8 million acres, which
represented 83.4 per cent of the 1988 national base of 225.2
million acres.

<HEAD>Trump Plans To Turn Eastern Shuttle To Trump Shuttle In Two Weeks</HEAD>

   Developer Donald Trump plans to have Eastern
Airlines' Northeast shuttle flying as the renamed Trump Shuttle in
about two weeks, the head of the business said Thursday.
   Bruce Nobles, president of Trump Shuttle, said the new service
would be ``reliable, comfortable, efficient and clean.''
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland earlier Thursday
formally approved Eastern's $365 million shuttle sale to Trump.
Lifland had approved the sale in principle late Wednesday after
rival suitor America West Airlines withdrew its $415 million offer
after failing to arrange financing.
   ``I'm elated about it. I've been unemployed for three months;
it's a relief,'' said Bill Sanford, a striking Eastern pilot from
Marietta, Ga., who is one of 170 pilots tentatively hired by Trump
Shuttle.
   The deal for the New York-Washington-Boston shuttle should be
closed in about two weeks and the Trump Shuttle should be operating
soon after that, Nobles told reporters at the bankruptcy courthouse
in Manhattan.
   Nobles said Trump was aiming to capture 75 percent of the
shuttle market split with Pan Am Corp. by the first year of
operation, but he called that goal ``a little ambitious.''
   The shuttle is used mainly by business travelers and was
Eastern's only consistently profitable operation before the March 4
strike by its Machinists, which was joined by its pilots and flight
attendants unions. Because of the walkout, it lost many passengers
to Pan Am's rival shuttle.
   Trump has pledged to spend ``tremendous amounts of money'' to
upgrade the shuttle, whose fleet of 21 aging, blue-and-silver
Boeing 727s will be redecorated and emblazoned with red, black and
gold stripes and Trump's name on the tail.
   Trump, who owns several casino-hotels in Atlantic City, N.J.,
also operates a helicopter service between New York and that resort
city and has indicated an interest in routing the shuttle there.
   Miami-based Eastern initially agreed to sell the shuttle to
Trump last October. The deal was delayed by court challenges from
Eastern's unions and the need for bankruptcy court approval.
   Any Eastern asset sales must be approved by the court. Eastern
filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors March 9.
   Eastern's unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity. But
Texas Air decided to sell the shuttle and about $1.4 billion in
other Eastern assets separately, as part of a plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier.
   Richard Seltzer, an attorney for the pilots union, said Thursday
the unions were happy with Trump's ownership of the shuttle. He
also said they were continuing discussions with investor groups
that have submitted formal bids for all of Eastern, including
groups headed by former Piedmont Airlines chairman William Howard
and by Chicago commodities trader Joseph Ritchie.
   America West, an aggressive Phoenix-based regional carrier, had
offered $415 million for the shuttle and $336 million for 10 Boeing
757s. Alternatively, America West offered to buy only the shuttle's
gates and landing slots at the three airports for $375 million.
   Lorenzo and Trump renegotiated their original contract in April,
after the strike caused many Eastern shuttle passengers to defect
to the Pan Am Corp. shuttle. The new agreement gave Trump four four
additional 727s for the same price.
   Trump has recognized Eastern's unions as representatives for
employees of his shuttle, while America West said it would not
employ Eastern workers if it bought the shuttle.
   Trump has signed labor contracts with pilots and flight
attendants, but not with members of the Machinists union. Nobles
said the Machinists would be able to work for the Trump Shuttle
initially without a contract.

   The stock wavered in a narrow range today in a
mixed response to the newest data on the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .37 to 2,484.24 by
3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 767 up, 631 down and
538 unchanged.
   The Commerce Department said the nation's gross national product
grew at a 4.3 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation,
in the first quarter of the year, down from a previous estimate of
5.5 percent.
   That initially appeared to be a plus for stocks, by reinforcing
evidence that the economy was slowing in response to the Federal
Reserve's campaign against inflation.
   But analysts noted that the figures got a new interpretation on
close inspection when traders saw that much of the drop stemmed
from a reduction in inventories.
   Tight inventories are more often than not a forerunner of strong
economic activity, since they create a situation where new orders
translate quickly into a need for production.

<HEAD>SEC Censures Salomon For Short-Selling During '87 Market Crash</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: SUBS 19th graf to CLARIFY that rule allows short sales when
stock price is unchanged as well as higher.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Salomon Brothers Inc. on Thursday became the
first investment firm sanctioned by the government for violating
laws governing short-selling during the 1987 stock market crash.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Salomon agreed to be
censured to settle Securities and Exchange Commission allegations
regarding its short sales, which are a type of speculation aimed at
profiting from market declines.
   Salomon also agreed to establish procedures to prevent future
short-selling violations, said the SEC, which further alleged
Salomon ``willfully'' failed to promptly turn over its books for
inspection. Salomon will not pay a fine.
   Salomon spokesman Robert Baker said the firm ``did not refuse to
produce documents.'' While Salomon ``had difficulty responding as
quickly as the SEC wanted ...the SEC was not denied a single
document.''
   Many Wall Streeters have said privately that short-selling
aggravated the spectacular drop in stock prices on Oct. 19, 1987,
when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 508 points. But
observers noted the Salomon short sales cited by the SEC were a
drop in the bucket and did not effect events that day.
   Short-selling is the sale of borrowed stock by investors who
believe the price of a stock will decline and that they will be
able to profit by repaying their borrowings with cheaper shares.
Short sale rules prohibit the strategy when a stock price already
is falling.
   ``I view this as a signal to the securities industry that they
had better start to improve their compliance ... to our
examinations,'' said Lawrence Iason, the SEC's New York regional
administrator. ``If they don't, penalities in the future will be
more severe.''
   The SEC stated Salomon made 70 short sales for its own account
throughout the Black Monday crash. The sales involved 300,000
shares of stock in 19 New York Stock Exchange companies.
   Iason could not comment on how much Salomon profited from the
sales. The 19 companies whose stocks were involved weren't
identified.
   Salomon's Baker said there was ``no suggestion that any Salomon
Brothers trader intentionally engaged in a transaction contrary to
the short-sale rule or that any ... customer was disadvantaged in
any way.''
   The SEC said the shares Salomon sold short carried a market
value of $12.5 million. Baker said the firm traded $2.5 billion in
securities on Black Monday.
   On Wall Street, market players shrugged off the SEC action.
   ``When it's over, we'll probably find out that everybody did it.
It's not a big conspiracy, it's that everybody was having their
heads handed to them,'' said James Cramer, president of the money
management firm Cramer &amp; Co.
   Iason could not comment on whether other firms were being
investigated for similar violations.
   James Kirby, chairman of Los Angeles-based Capital Guardian
Trust and a member of the presidential Brady Commission that
studied the crash, said it was very difficult to identify short
sales on Black Monday.
   ``I wouldn't assign it a high priority in terms of its
contribution to an unbelievable event. It was one of several
things,'' he said.
   Short selling was widely abused after the Crash of 1929 by
speculators who would gang up on a target company, spreading lies
about it to drive down the stock price.
   Such abuses led the NYSE to implement the short-sale rule, which
theoretically prevents short sellers from intentionally depressing
a stock price.
   Under the rule, a short sale may be executed only in instances
when the previous sale raised the stock's price or left it
unchanged.
   Shortly after Black Monday, the SEC and the NYSE began probing
allegations that improper short selling may have contributed to the
crash, though ultimately they reached no determination.
   While the short-selling allegations are serious, it is
particularly unusual for the SEC to admonish a securities firm for
failing to respond quickly to its investigation. Some speculated
the SEC may have been more concerned about that than about
Salomon's trading violations.
   To prevent further abuses, Salomon agreed that semi-annual
reviews of its short-sale compliance procedures be conducted by a
senior internal auditor and an independent certified public
accounting form or outside legal counsel.

   Sony Corp. said Thursday its fourth-quarter profit
jumped 56.1 percent and its annual earnings nearly doubled, boosted
by higher sales in all of its electronics divisions.
   After-tax income totaled 14.4 billion yen, or about $109
million, in the three months ended March 31, up from 9.2 billion
yen a year earlier.
   Sales were 539 billion yen, or about $4.1 billion, in the fourth
quarter, up from 407 billion yen a year earlier.
   For the full year, net income grew to 72.5 billion yen, or $549
million, up from 37 billion yen the prior year.
   Sales for the full year totaled 2.15 trillion yen, or $16.2
billion, up from the prior year's 1.56 trillion yen.
   Sony said revenue growth reflected strong worldwide demand for
major consumer electronics products, such as video cassette
recorders and audio equipment including compact disk players.

   Assets of the nation's 468 money market mutual
funds rose $126.5 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise, to a record $312.07 billion in the seven-day period
ended Wednesday, followed a $4.9 billion increase in the funds'
assets the previous week, according to the Washington-based mutual
fund trade group.
   The funds' assets hit their previous record high of $311.95
billion in the week ended May 17, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 231 general purpose funds fell $192.6 million to $101.23
billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $45.7 million
to $131.43 billion, and assets of 142 institutional funds rose
$273.4 million to $79.41 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 9.14 percent from 9.16 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 9.15 percent from 9.17 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
38 days, up from 36 days, Donoghue's said.
   Separately, the newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of
100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan assocations and
savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the
effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to
6.62 percent as of Wednesday from 6.63 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was 5.15 percent, unchanged from the previous week.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 9.21
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 9.27 the
previous week. Yields were 9.33 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
9.42 percent; 9.14 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 9.23 percent;
and 9.07 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 9.14 percent.

<HEAD>Rudy Ruderman, SEC Settle Civil Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Business Week radio broadcaster Seymour
G. ``Rudy'' Ruderman has agreed to pay the Securities and Exchange
Commission more than $40,000 to settle a civil suit stemming from
his use of nonpublic information to make investments, the
commission said Thursday.
   The 62-year-old financial journalist currently is serving a
six-month jail term for illegal stock market trades.
   Ruderman pleaded guilty last year to two counts of mail fraud
after he was fired by Business Week for trading on information
learned from prepublication copies of the magazine's ``Inside Wall
Street'' column.
   Lawrence Iason, regional administrator of the New York office of
the SEC, said Ruderman agreed to pay $20,734.89 ``representing his
gross illegal trading profits,'' and a like amount in civil
penalities and fines.
   Under the agreement reached in April and approved Wednesday by
the SEC, the U.S. district court in Manhattan will set up a bank
account to repay investors who lost money because of Ruderman's
illegal trades.
   Ruderman, a resident of Scarsdale and a widely known veteran
financial news broadcaster, had produced a syndicated stock-market
report since 1981 as Business Week's broadcast editor.
   Manhattan U.S. District Judge Robert J. Ward sentenced Ruderman
on April 5 to six months in jail, fined him $5,000 and placed him
on probation for three years after his release from jail.

   Petroleum futures prices finished lower Thursday
at the end of a volatile session dominated by speculation about the
outcome of an OPEC meeting next month.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, ended at
$19.48 a 42-gallon barrel, off 18 cents, following a rise of 62
cents on Wednesday.
   Prices for crude oil contracts for delivery after July also fell.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home
heating oil for delivery in June slid 0.56 cent to 49.05 cents a
gallon after rising 2.11 cents in the prior session. The June
contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.22 cent to 66.61 cents a
gallon following Wednesday's gain of 2.59 cents.
   Analysts said gas and other petroleum futures prices rallied
early when report of a gasoline pipeline explosion in San
Bernardino, Calif. raised speculation about a possible supply
disruption.
   But Mary L. Haskins, assistant vice president at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc., said the buyers bailed out after awhile, possibly
because they were reluctant to accumulate significant holdings
ahead of the meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries that begins in Vienna on June 5.
   There has been speculation that the 13-nation cartel may decide
to boost their output limits.

   Construction contracts surged by 9 percent in
April, reflecting a large increase in new housing construction, an
industry survey reported Thursday.
   The value of newly started construction contracts increased to
an annual rate of $256.8 billion last month, up from $236.1 billion
in March, the F.W. Dodge Group of McGraw-Hill Information Services
Co. reported.
   Residential building contracts rose 16 percent to an annual rate
of $126.1 billion, while nonresidential building contracts _ which
includes institutional, commercial and industrial building _
increased 5 percent to $82.2 billion.
   Contracts for nonbuilding construction, which comprises public
works and utilities, were little changed from March's performance,
with an annual rate of $48.5 billion.
   Overall construction contracting for the first four months of
the year has been off 2 percent, to an unadjusted total of $75.68
billion from $77.28 billion a year earlier.
   Much of the decrease was attributed to cutbacks in construction
of office and apartment buildings, partly because of higher
interest rates that slowed borrowing demand.
   ``It remains to be seen whether April's surprising improvement
will have staying power,'' said George A. Christie, F.W. Dodge's
chief economist, ``but it does show that the construction sector so
far is taking this year's higher interest rates in stride instead
of collapsing into a downward spiral.''

   The dollar fell in nervous trading Thursday,
reflecting rounds of central bank intervention and fears of
interest rate hikes abroad.
   Gold prices rose. Republic National Bank of New York said the
late bid for a troy ounce of gold was $365.90, compared with
$362.40 late Wednesday.
   Traders were not surprised by the currency's retreat after its
recent rise. ``Everyone was looking for a correction phase to
begin, and it's begun,'' said Jim McGroarty, a senior vice
president at Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``The question is how far (down) do we go?'' he said.
   Market strategists expect the dollar-selling to continue as
speculators protect themselves against any hike in European
interest rates over the long Memorial Day weekend, which could
cause the dollar to fall.
   A day after British interest rates moved higher, the Swiss
National Bank on Thursday announced the introduction of a flexible
Lombard rate policy. Dealers said that this daily adjustment of the
Lombard rate, which acts as a ceiling for Swiss interest rates, was
seen as a prelude to a rate increase.
   The Lombard rate is what the central bank charges commercial
banks for supplemental borrowings in which securities are used as
collateral.
   ``The Swiss announcement had a psychological impact on the
market after the U.K. rate rise and the continued threat of rate
increases in Japan and West Germany,'' said Joe Leitch, a foreign
exchange director at Salomon Brothers International in London.
   The Federal Reserve, the Bank of Canada and several European
central banks intervened against the dollar shortly after the
government announced a downward revision in the nation's gross
national product for the first quarter to 4.3 percent from a 5.5
percent estimate.
   Overall, however, ``intervention hasn't been all that
effective,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of
Boston. Many who are still bullish on dollar note that it is the
central bank and not investors who are doing the selling.
   ``We have some room to come off a little further still, but next
week the dollar should resume its upward momentum,'' Lawrie said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 142.35 Japanese yen, down 0.65
yen from the 19-month high posted Wednesday. Later in London, the
dollar fell further to 142.05 yen. In New York, the dollar finished
at 141.23 yen, down from 142.78 yen on Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.5815 from $1.5695 late
Wednesday. In New York it cost $1.5910 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.5700.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday included: 1.9800 West German marks, down from 2.0137;
1.7425 Swiss francs, down from 1.7855; 6.7035 French francs, down
from 6.8225; 1,434.50 Italian lire, down from 1,459.00, and 1.2068
Canadian dollars, down from 1.2085.

<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS July soybean price in final graf to $7.02</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean prices were mixed in light
trading on the Chicago Board of Trade as a weaker dollar helped
spark buying of soybeans and corn futures.
   Corn and soybean prices bounced back despite the National
Weather Service's latest 6- to 10-day outlook. The forecast,
released late Wednesday, calls for normal to above-normal rain in
most major growing areas.
   Analysts say soybean futures have lost about 65 cents over the
past two weeks. And there is a feeling the selloff is a little
overdone, setting the stage for a short-term rally, said Anne
Frick, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Although wheat futures prices moved higher in early trading on
indications the Soviet Union was bidding for 200,000 metric tons of
wheat, selling brought down prices near the close of trading.
   At the close, wheat was 1 cent higher to 3\ cents lower with the
contract for delivery in July at $3.96 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to
3 cent higher with July at $2.64$ a bushel; oats were } cent lower
to a { cent higher with July at $1.73{ a bushel; soybeans were 9
cents lower to 4} cents higher with July at $7.02 a bushel.

<HEAD>Strike Would Have Little Impact on Direct Dialing; Would Stop Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by AT&amp;T's union workers would have
little impact on customers who dial long-distance directly but
could slow operator service and bring company production of
telecommunications equipment to a virtual halt.
   Union and company officials who commented Thursday on the
potential impact of a strike expressed hope a contract agreement
would be reached by Saturday night's deadline.
   But the unions _ the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers _ also attacked
anew American Telephone &amp; Telegraph's proposal to shift more health
care costs to workers. And it appeared increasingly unlikely an
agreement would be reached by the deadline.
   The unions have hinted they would not immediately call a strike
and would rely instead on other tactics designed to pressure AT&amp;T
into a settlement, primarily a nationwide labor boycott that union
officials contend could cut AT&amp;T's daily long-distance volume by 8
percent.
   Still, a strike is expected if no agreement is reached within
several days after the deadline.
   If there is a strike, both sides are in virtual agreement over
the likely impact on AT&amp;T long-distance services, which include
about 80 million calls on an average business day and which
generated $35.2 billion in 1988 revenues for the company.
   Technological advances should allow AT&amp;T to provide direct-dial
long-distance services without significant interruptions.
   However, customers needing operator assistance for long distance
would have to rely on management personnel filling in for operators
who struck; there are an estimated 21,500 union workers in those
jobs.
   In addition, 35,500 technicians are represented by the unions,
and management would be called on to perform their jobs as well.
Those tasks include installing and maintaining telecommunications
equipment both within AT&amp;T offices and in businesses nationwide. A
company spokesman said AT&amp;T has management teams prepared to
complete all major installations scheduled for the next five weeks.
   Also, the nearly 37,000 CWA and IBEW factory workers in the
United States would be expected to strike. AT&amp;T plans to keep its
U.S. factories open but concedes that a widespread strike would
essentially halt production of switching and transmission equipment.
   ``It's pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket
lines are being honored on a high percentage basis,'' AT&amp;T
spokesman Herb Linnen said.
   AT&amp;T is the leader in developing sensitive long-distance
equipment and of late has been aggressively seeking to expand its
global sales.
   Also, 54,000 union workers perform clerical, sales,
administrative and other tasks, including staffing AT&amp;T retail
sales outlets. In these areas a strike could have substantial
impact on operations, union officials said.
   Linnen refused to disclose how many management personnel were
part of the ``emergency teams'' he said were being readied for a
possible strike. That planning is under way at AT&amp;T's operations
center in New Jersey.
   ``Our objective is to provide the kind of high-quality service
that customers expect from AT&amp;T and we will press into service our
experienced supervisory people to fill in if there is a work
stoppage,'' Linnen said.
   Union officials essentially agreed with Linnen's account.
   ``Anytime you take 175,000 people off the job it has an impact
on that business,'' said Francine Zucker, spokeswoman for the
Communications Workers of America. ``But the unions don't have any
illusions that we can shut AT&amp;T totally down.''
   Ms. Zucker said during a 26-day CWA strike in 1986 ``some of the
managers who replaced operators proved they could do the job,
others did not. They are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliar
jobs and the added stress would have an impact on the quality of
service.''
   AT&amp;T workers represented by the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers did not honor the CWA strike three years ago but
are negotiating jointly with CWA for the first time this year.
Three years ago AT&amp;T was able to keep its IBEW-representented
manufacturing plants open.
   The negotiations, which began in late March, are hung up over
AT&amp;T's proposal to shift health care costs to workers. The company
says it spent $1 billion on health care last year and forecasts a
10 percent annual increase for the next several years unless it
redesigns its program.
   The unions have attacked that proposal and also have termed
inadequate AT&amp;T's pay offer, which included varying base wage
increases for employees, lump sum payments and the company's
first-ever profit-sharing plan for the unionized workers.
   The unions are expected to make a formal counter-offer on Friday.

<HEAD>SEC Authorizes Exchanges to Compete Against One Another</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Salomon-SEC Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday authorized exchanges to compete against one another in
trading stock options, a move designed to benefit customers but
opposed by many of the exchanges.
   The commission voted 5-0 to phase out current rules that
restrict the trading of particular options to only one exchange.
Beginning Jan. 22, 1990, new options can be traded on more than one
exchange. As of Jan. 21, 1991, existing options will be open for
competition.
   The unanimous vote came despite what commission members
acknowledged was heavy lobbying by the exchanges for a delay.
   After 12 years of study and consideration, ``the time has come
for the Securities and Exchange Commission to adopt a rule that
will move this process forward,'' SEC Chairman David S. Ruder said.
   Stock options give the buyer the right to purchase or sell stock
by a specific date at a designated price. Big institutional
investors such as pension funds and insurance companies use options
to hedge their portfolios, protecting them against unexpected price
swings. Individual investors sometimes speculate with options.
   Since 1980, the lucrative and exclusive right to trade new
options on exchange-listed stocks has been awarded through a
lottery. Option contracts on Texaco stock, for instance, are traded
only on the American Stock Exchange and options on IBM stock are
traded exclusively on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange.
   However, since 1985 exchanges have competed against one another
in trading options on over-the-counter stocks, a much smaller
market than options for exchange-listed stocks.
   The SEC staff argues that competition has worked well for
options on over-the-counter stocks and similar competition for
options on exchange-listed stocks would allow customers to use the
exchange that does a more efficient and less costly job of managing
trading.
   The National Association of Securities Dealers favors the
change, but most exchanges express varying degrees of reservation.
Regional exchanges such as the Philadelphia Stock Exchange and the
Pacific Stock Exchange fear they will lose business to larger
competitors. But even a larger market such as the American Stock
Exchange, which favors multiple listing, argued for a more cautious
approach.
   Ivers Riley, senior executive vice president at the American
Stock Exchange, said the SEC should have authorized multiple
listing only of new options. Opening up multiple trading of options
already assigned to one exchange could prove to be too costly and
disruptive for the exchanges at this time, he said.
   But, Richard G. Ketchum, SEC director of market regulation, said
he did not expect the new rules to produce dramatic shifts. He said
it would be difficult for an exchange to wrest trading of an
established option away from the exchange that now trades it.
   Ketchum argued that multiple trading will give brokerage firms
the leverage with exchanges to win more favorable trading terms for
their customers.
   Also, it will give the exchanges the incentive to develop an
integrated electronic system that will allow brokers to route
options business to whichever exchange is offering the best price
at the moment, he said. The SEC is issuing a ``white paper'' with
advice on how to put together such a system and is inviting
responses from the industry.
   Depending on the prospects for developing an integrated system,
commission member Mary Schapiro said she would consider requests
this fall for delaying the start multiple options trading.
   Nicholas A. Giordano, president of the Philadelphia Stock
Exchange, said he feared multiple options trading without an
integrated system would hurt customers by making it impossible to
obtain the best price, which he said could be assured if an option
was traded on a single exchange.
   He said members of congressional committees with oversight of
the SEC share his concern and he might ask them to hold hearings on
the matter.
   And, noting that President Bush this summer will likely replace
a majority of the five-member SEC, Giordano said Thursday's SEC
vote was ``tantamount to throwing a grenade into a room and
leaving.''

<TEXT>
   Hitachi Ltd., one of Japan's largest makers of
electric and electronic machinery, Thursday said its earnings rose
35.7 percent on a 12 percent sales gain.
   Earnings rose to 185.6 billion yen ($1.4 billion) in the 12
months ended March 31 from 136.8 billion yen ($1.04 billion) in the
prior year. On a per-share basis, earnings were 58.94 yen (45
cents) vs. 44.14 yen (33 cents).
   Sales totaled 6.40 trillion yen ($48.5 billion), up 12 percent
from 5.72 trillion yen.
   The results were for Hitachi and 679 subsidiaries, which make a
broad array of electronics products and computer gear. The number
of subsidiaries included in the latest results was greater than in
the past, due to an accounting change.
   Hitachi said Japan's present sustained economic expansion
generated demand for computers, other communications systems and
semiconductors in the home market while robust econmic growth
worldwide brought about a recovery in demand for a variety of
electronic products.
   A drop in the costs of materials overseas, partly because of the
yen's strength during the fiscal year, also contributed to the
strong financial performance.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Honda Motor Co. Thursday reported its
fourth-quarter earnings fell 26.3 percent and its annual profit
slid 2.9 percent, attributing the declines to less favorable
currency-exchange values.
   The Tokyo-based automobile manufacturer said after-tax income
totaled 24.3 billion yen ($184 million) in the three months ended
March 31, down from 33 billion yen a year earlier.
   Net income per American share, which each represent 10 shares of
Honda common stock, came to $1.87 in the fourth quarter, down from
$2.54 in the prior year's final quarter.
   Quarterly sales were 886.8 billion yen ($6.7 billion) compared
to 825.3 billion yen a year earlier.
   Honda's annual profit totaled 97.2 billion yen ($737 million)
down from 100.2 billion yen the previous year.
   Earnings per American share were $7.46 last year vs. $7.54 a
year earlier.
   Sales for the full year were 3.49 trillion yen ($26.4 billion)
in the year ended March 31, up 7.9 percent from 3.23 trillion yen a
year before. Higher sales of cars in Japan and North America
boosted the figures.
   The latest results are Honda's first since the company switched
its fiscal year to end on March 31 rather than the last day of
February. Comparative figures given for the report, thus, represent
a hypothetical towelve-month period.
   Honda said a drop in the gains on foreign exchange conversions
led to deterioration in its profit.

<TEXT>
   If you were part of the throng at the Woodstock
music festival 20 years ago this summer, Life magazine wants to
know.
   More specifically, Life wants to know what happened to people
who appeared in photographs in its special issue published a few
weeks after that three-day celebration in August 1969.
   Life's editors spent about $37,000 for a full-page advertisement
that ran in the New York Times earlier this week asking
``Woodstock: Were you there?''
   The ad included a photo from the 1969 issue of a scraggly couple
posing in a clearing among the trees during the festival and a
coupon which readers were asked to complete and mail in if they
were there a generation ago.
   ``What do you remember about those three days of peace and love
and mud? Did the experience change you life? Where are the people
you went to Woodstock with?'' the coupon asks.
   A promotional trick to boost circulation? It won't hurt.
   But Life's managing editor, Patricia Ryan, said she hopes the ad
will attract as many as 20,000 replies that her staff will use in
assembling a special Woodstock anniversary section for the August
issue.
   She said she hopes to run some of the old photos from the 1969
issue next to current ones and include a few stories about what has
happened to those folks since Woodstock.
   ``We were just sitting around looking at pictures and we started
wondering where are they today? Are they bankers, brokers, junk
bond salesmen, farmers?'' she said.
   The Woodstock Music and Arts Festival, which featured
appearances by some of the biggest rock music performers of the
day, ran from Aug. 15-17 on a farm in Bethel, N.Y. The event, which
suffered soaking rainstorms and mud, attracted an estimated half
million people and became a symbol for a generation of how people
can coexist peacefully in trying circumstances.
   Life, a Time Inc. publication, won't be alone in marking the
event.
   Rolling Stone asked its own readers in January to send along
their reminiscences about Woodstock for inclusion in the bimonthly
magazine's issue that goes on sale Aug. 8. Spokesman Stu Zakim said
the magazine got more than 1,000 replies.
   MTV Networks is planning special programming over the next
several months ranging from periodic ``Woodstock Minutes'' to
showing the three-hour Warner Bros. movie ``Woodstock'' on its MTV:
Music Television and VH-1: Video Hits One cable networks.
   Neither Life, with a monthly circulation of 1.8 million, nor
Rolling Stone, with circulation of 1.175 million, increased their
ad rates for the anniversary issues, which the companies expect to
be big sellers.
   Why did Life wait until late May to ask for additional material
for an issue that is expected to be completed in early July?
   ``Sometimes you get good ideas late,'' said Ms. Ryan.

<HEAD>Grains And Soybeans Mixed in Light Trading</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean prices were mixed in light
trading Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade, but received some
strength from a weaker dollar.
   On other markets, precious metal prices climbed, livestock and
meat prices were mixed, and energy futures were mostly lower.
   The dollar fell as concern grew over central bank intervention
and interest rate hikes abroad.
   The weakened dollar brought some buyers back into the grain and
soybean markets. Its strength had been believed to be holding down
export sales of grain, analysts said, since a more expensive dollar
makes U.S. commodities less attractive to foreign buyers.
   Wheat settled 6 cents lower to 1 cents higher with the contract
for delivery in July at $3.96 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 3 cents
higher with July at $2.64} a bushel; oats were 1 cent lower to a {
cent higher with July at $1.73{ a bushel; soybeans were 9 cents
lower to 4\ cents higher with July at $7.01{ a bushel.
   Corn and soybean prices bounced back despite the National
Weather Service's latest 6- to 10-day outlook. The forecast,
released late Wednesday, calls for normal to above-normal rain in
most major growing areas.
   Analysts say soybean futures have lost about 65 cents over the
past two weeks. And there is a feeling the selloff is a little
overdone, setting the stage for a short-term rally, said Anne
Frick, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York.
   Although wheat futures prices moved higher in early trading on
indications the Soviet Union was bidding for 200,000 metric tons of
wheat, selling brought down prices near the close of trading.
   Energy futures were mostly lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
   Gasoline futures fell amid reports of tight supplies in the
Midwest, said Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst for Carson Petroleum Co.
in Chicago.
   Ritterbusch said he believed prices should remain stable until
next month's meeting in Vienna of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 18 cents lower to 6 cents
higher with July at $19.48 a barrel; heating oil was .38 cent to
.58 cent lower with June at 49.05 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was .40 cent lower to .19 cent higher with June at 66.61 cents a
gallon.
   Livestock prices were mixed and pork futures mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   ``Pork bellies were down because we have a large inventory,''
said Dale Durchholz, an analyst with Agri-Visor Service Inc. in
Bloomington, Ill.
   ``To move the bellies out of storage, cash prices will have to
rise over future prices. To accomplish that belly futures will have
to go down.''
   Durchholz said the drop in pork belly prices bled over to hogs,
adding that the prospects of increased marketings also weighed on
hog prices.
   Live cattle futures were mixed, with nearby prices falling on
commission house liquidation.
   Feeder cattle prices were boosted by firm feeder cash prices.
   Live cattle were .67 cent lower to .10 cent higher with June at
69.20 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower to .23 cent
higher with May at 76.90 cents a pound; hogs were .80 cent lower to
.05 cent higher with June at 48.20 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .83 cent to 1.05 cents lower with July at 32.17 cents
a pound.
   Gold and silver prices were higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange in reaction to the dollar's drop in value.
   Analysts said that despite the lower dollar, investors were
hesitant to enter the market because of expectations the dollar
will resume its climb.
   Gold was $2.50 to $3.50 higher with June at $367.20 a troy
ounce; silver was 8.3 cents to 9.4 cents higher with July at $5.318
a troy ounce.

   Holders of stock in the Holly Farms Corp.
at the close of the business day June 6 will be eligible to vote on
a proposed merger with ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb., Holly Farms
said Thursday.
   A shareholders meeting for the vote is expected before the end
of July, Holly Farms said in a statement.
   The propoed merger, announced by Holly and ConAgra on May 21, is
a second attempt to join the two companies. Tyson Foods Inc. of
Springdale, Ark., continues its efforts, meanwhile, to take over
Holly Farms.
   Tyson has asked a Chancery Court in Delaware, where Holly Farms
is incorporated, to block the merger attempt.
   To be accomplished through a stock swap worth $1.3 billion, the
ConAgra-Holly merger would require approval of stockholders of both
companies.
   Holly shareholders decided April 17 to reject an earlier merger
attempt, valued at $1 billion. ConAgra shareholders approved it.
   Tyson Foods, which began the bidding war for Holly Farms last
October, has offered the company's stockholders $63.50 a share cash
for their stock. That offer is worth about $1.1 billion.
   Tyson is the nation's largest poultry processor while Holly
Farms is a diversified company heavily involved in fresh fryer
sales. ConAgra is a diversified food and agricultural services
company.

<HEAD>Money Supply Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All three measures of the nation's money supply
rose in mid-May, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The central bank said its narrowest measure of the money supply,
M1, edged up $100 million to a seasonally adjusted $773.1 billion
in the week ended May 15 from $773.0 billion the previous week.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $600 million to a
seasonally adjusted $3,070.9 billion from $3,070.3 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $4.5 billion to a seasonally
adjusted $3,958.6 billion from $3,954.1 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The Fed in February reaffirmed a provisional target for 1989 of
3 percent to 7 percent growth in M2 and 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent
growth in M3. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth since
early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,078.0 billion, a 1.5
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $3,953.1 billion, up 3.8 percent, while M1
fell 2.2 percent to an average of $783.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $466 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$535 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $289.6 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $290.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Drops Merger Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. called off a
merger agreement Thursday that was to be the cornerstone of efforts
to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
   The $747 million deal with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Inc., a
New York investment banking firm, began unraveling last week when
Allegheny International disclosed its 1989 earnings would be less
than anticipated, officials said.
   The deal was to be presented for approval Thursday in U.S.
Bankruptcy Court.
   Instead, Allegheny International proposed a plan that would lift
its key Sunbeam Corp. subsidiary out of bankruptcy separately
without an outside buyer. Creditors of the parent company would be
repaid with funds left over after Sunbeam is reorganized.
   Bruce McCullough, Allegheny International's lead bankruptcy
attorney, told U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Joseph L. Cosetti the
operating companies could emerge from Chapter 11 in three to four
months. He said the plan would be easy to finance and no vote by
Sunbeam creditors would be required because all would be fully
repaid.
   As part of the plan, Chief Executive Officer Oliver S. Travers
Jr. and other top managers at the parent company would be replaced,
as major creditors have demanded.
   But Robert Sable, attorney for Allegheny International's
unsecured creditors, said his group and the company's bank lenders
would oppose a reorganization involving only Sunbeam.
   The DLJ contract, which was struck in February, included a
clause allowing the banking firm to terminate the agreement if
Allegheny International failed to come within 95 percent of its
operating goals at any time from February to September, when its
fiscal year ends, officials said.
   The merger agreement required Allegheny International's domestic
operating companies to make an operating profit this fiscal year of
at least $66.5 million. But earnings projections now total only $61
million to $62 million, McCullough said.
   Allegheny International refused to accept the lower price of
$687 million DLJ offered because of the shortfall, officials said.
   Nicholas J. Sakallariadis, Allegheny International's investment
banking adviser, told reporters the poor projections were a
``complete shock.'' The most serious problems appeared to be at
Sunbeam-Oster's iron business, he said.
   Sakallariadis also said sales apparently were hurt when Black &amp;
Decker Corp., which had a brief agreement earlier this year to
acquire Sunbeam-Oster, indicated the Sunbeam and Oster lines would
be discontinued.
   The break between Allegheny International and DLJ was the
second. In January, Allegheny International called a halt to the
deal when it learned DLJ had secretly agreed to sell two divisions
to a Los Angeles financier and a New York merchant banking group.
   Allegheny Internationl then devised its own reorganization plan
backed by equity holders and agreed to sell Sunbeam-Oster to Black
&amp; Decker, its main competitor. But that plan was quickly shelved.
   Sunbeam Corp. is comprised of Allegheny International's major
operating units, including Almet-Lawnlite Inc., which manufactures
patio furniture; Oster-Sunbeam Appliance Co., which manufactures
small appliances; Northern Electric Co., which makes electric
blankets and heating pads; and Sunbeam Leisure Products Co., which
makes barbecue grills.

<TEXT>
   Two General Motors Corp. car-making divisions on
Thursday adjusted their incentive packages by adding some vehicles,
boosting the incentives on others and cutting back rebates on a few
models.
   The new incentives announced by the Pontiac and Chevrolet
divisions run through July 10.
   Incentives are used by automakers to help sell models that
aren't selling as fast as they hope.
   On March 30, GM announced a wide-ranging package of incentives
for many of its cars and light trucks. That package was to expire
on June 5.
   That announcement came the day after Ford Motor Co. kicked off
the latest round of incentive frenzy with a program that gave
buyers the option of cash rebates or financing with interest rates
as low as 2.9 percent.
   That program is scheduled to end Wednesday. Ford spokesman Bill
Carroll said earlier this week he expected the company to make an
announcement then that it was extending some form of incentives.
   Chrysler Corp. followed its larger cousins' lead in early April
and offered interest-free financing on some loans as an option to
cash rebates. The Chrysler program has no expiration date.

<HEAD>Shuttle Sale Marks Key Juncture in Eastern Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Eastern-Trump Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Eastern Airlines' Northeast shuttle
business to developer Donald Trump marks a critical juncture in
Eastern's 2{-month path through a bruising strike and complex
bankruptcy proceeding.
   The $365 million sale to Trump was approved formally Thursday by
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, following eight months
that saw court challenges to the deal by Eastern's unions and by a
rival suitor.
   The sale of the New York-Washington-Boston shuttle means Eastern
won't be sold in its entirety _ a key goal of the airline's unions.
   Miami-based Eastern filed for Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors March 9, five days after the start of a strike by
Machinists that has been supported by pilots and flight attendants
and has forced a sharp curtailing of Eastern's flights.
   The unions have vowed not to end their strike until the airline
was sold or otherwise taken from the control of Frank Lorenzo,
chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
   The company has received several buyout proposals, including a
$464 million plan from a group led by former baseball commissioner
Peter Ueberroth, but has not accepted any as viable.
   In recent weeks, Eastern's unions have had intensive discussions
with investor groups interested in buying all of Eastern. Two of
those groups, one headed by former Piedmont Airlines chairman
William Howard and the other by Chicago commodities trader Joseph
Ritchie, have submitted formal bids to the bankruptcy court, which
must approve any sale of Eastern or its assets.
   David I. Shapiro, the court-appointed examiner for Eastern, has
dismissed those offers as not viable and challenged potential
suitors to include at least $100 million in cash toward the
purchase.
   Lorenzo has said the shuttle sale would give momentum to his own
plan to rebuild Eastern as a smaller carrier and sell another $1.4
billion or so worth of Eastern assets. The bankruptcy court has not
yet passed judgment on that plan, although Eastern has been making
deals for the sale of aircraft, landing slots and other assets in
the event it is approved.
   Eastern also has been hiring and training new pilots to replace
the strikers, and says it plans to have enough, when combined with
pilots it expects to cross picket lines, to meet the needs of the
smaller carrier.

<HEAD>LIN Board Proposes Spinoff of TV Stations as Separate Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   LIN Broadcasting Corp., which has interests in
television, cellular telephone service and publishing, said
Thursday its board has approved in principle spinning off its seven
TV stations as a separate company.
   The company, a frequent subject of takeover speculation, said
the spinoff would be ``for operating purposes aimed at maximum
development of the company's two principal businesses, each of
which will operate as an independent publicly-held company.''
   ``It is not intended as a precursor to any other corporate
transaction,'' the company said.
   But Wall Streeters pushed the company's stock sharply higher in
the wake of the news. LIN stock rose $4.75 a share to $101 in
consolidated national over-the-counter trading.
   The television stations and the cellular and publishing
businesses have been roughly equal contributors to LIN's recent
financial performance.
   But analysts have said the company's cellular telephone business
has proven increasingly attractive as that flegdling industry has
expanded rapidly.
   Under the proposal backed by the board, LIN said stock of a new
company that will own the seven LIN TV stations would be spun off
in a tax-free transaction to the holders of LIN's 51 million shares
of stock.
   Each of the seven stations is affiliated with one of the three
major networks.
   LIN would continue to own interests in five cellular telephone
systems and a business that publishes specialty magazines for
hotels.
   The announcement said the details of the spinoff such as the
exchange ratio and management structure of the new company not been
determined.
   But it said Donald A. Pels, chairman and chief executive of LIN,
probably would be chief executive of LIN and the new company.
   Pels said he anticipated the spinoff could be completed duirng
the summer, although he added he could offer no assurance the deal
would be completed in that time period if at all.
   In 1988, LIN's operating cash flow from its television stations
amounted to $75 million on revenue of $137 million. Its cellular
and publishing businesses had operating cash flow of $70 million on
revenue of $142 million.
   Overall, LIN earned $82.1 million, or $1.54 a share, on revenue
of $225 million in 1988.
   Its television stations include KXAS in Dallas-Fort Worth; WISH
in Indianapolis; WOTV in Grand Rapids-Kalamazoo-Battle Creek,
Mich.; WAVY in Hampton Roads, Va.; KXAN in Austin, Texas; WAND in
Decatur-Champaign-Springfield-Danville, Ill., and WANE in Fort
Wayne, Ind.
   The company's cellular telelphone systems are in New York,
Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Dallas-Fort Worth and Houston.
   Its publishing unit creates advertiser-supported hardcover
magazines that are placed in the rooms of hotels in 37 metropolitan
areas and provide guests with information about local attractions.

   General Motors Corp. said Thursday it is
extending a five-year, 50,000-mile warranty on front-wheel-drive
power steering assemblies to cars made between 1985 and 1988.
   GM said the systems may fail to work properly shortly after the
engine is started in cold weather.
   In January 1988, GM announced a five-year, 50,000-mile power
steering warranty on front-wheel-drive cars made between 1982 and
1985.
   But the Washington-based Center for Auto Safety said it was
disappointed that GM did not plan to notify consumers directly
about the problem. The consumer advocacy group unsuccessfully
petitioned for a recall of the cars in 1986.
   ``People in this situation may be spending $500 or $600 for
repair, needlessly,'' said the center's Russell Shew.
   GM said it would reimburse owners who paid to have the problem
corrected within the five-year or 50,000-mile limit if those cars
were not eligible for the coverage now.

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury Thursday subpoenaed Dow
Jones &amp; Co. for stories pertaining to a statement issued Tuesday by
a man who claimed to be preparing an offer to acquire NWA Inc. and
Pan Am Corp. simultaneously.
   The New York Stock Exchange temporarily halted trading in shares
of Pan Am and NWA on Tuesday after another market news service
indicated it was planning a story about the statement, which both
companies have said they do not take seriously.
   Dow Jones News Service, which is owned by Dow Jones &amp; Co.,
reported it was subpoenaed in Newark for all documents referring or
relating to Michael Stern, who issued the statement about the
potential bid.
   An attorney for Dow Jones who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the subpoena later was amended to include only a copy of the
story the news service issued about the trading halt and reason for
it.
   In the statement issued Tuesday to several news agencies in New
York, including The Associated Press, Stern identified himself as
chairman of Trans Global Holdings Inc. and said the company was in
the final stages of forming an investor group to buy the airlines.
   NWA, the parent of Northwest Airlines, has solicited potential
buyers since receiving a $2.7 billion takeover offer from investor
Marvin Davis. Several companies and investor groups, including Pan
Am, have expressed interest in acquiring NWA.
   The New York exchange halted trading in Pan Am and NWA after
Reuters news service alerted the exchange it was about to run a
story about the bid.
   In interviews, Stern refused to provide information to
substantiate his claims and an exchange spokeswoman later termed
his news release as appearing ``somewhat less than credible.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Diane Weeks declined to comment on the
subpoena or why it was issued in Newark.
   A spokesman for Reuters, Michael Reilly, did not immediately
return a telephone message at his home.
   Rich Torrenzano, a New York Stock Exchange spokesman, said that
as of Thursday the exchange had not been subpoenaed or asked for
similar information by authorities.
   It was not known immediately whether any other subpoenaes were
issued.

   A Cedar Rapids, Iowa, food processor,
Cedarrapids Meats Inc., has voluntarily recalled an estimated 800
canned hams distributed in 13 states because the meat may be
undercooked, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said the hams _ a total of about
9,000 pounds _ could cause trichinosis if eaten. However, he added,
no illnesses have been reported.
   The hams were distributed to consignees in Arkansas, Florida,
Iowa, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia. Those may have sold
the hams to customers in other states.
   The product was described as canned 11-pound, 4-ounce hams
labeled ``Wilson Continental Deli Ham, Water Added.'' The
establishment number, ``Est. 111'' is printed inside the USDA
inspection seal on the label.
   Crawford said the hams can be idenfified by the code number
0898D embossed on the end of the can. The hams are generally sold
as a food service item to establishments such as delicatessens,
hotels, schools and restaurants. No other products are involved in
the recall.
   ``As a precautionary measure, we are encouraging all food
service establishments who purchased these hams to return them to
their distributor,'' he said. ``We are also encouraging consumers
who may have purchased this product in sliced form to contact their
delicatessen.''
   The problem was reported to Wilson Foods by a food service
customer, who noticed the ham did not look properly cooked,
Crawford said. Cedarrapids Meats was contacted, and the company
immediately initiated a recall and notified USDA, Crawford said.
   Hogs may have microscopic living worms called trichinae in their
muscle tissue at the time of slaughter, he said. If the organisms
are not killed by proper cooiking or processing, the pork could
cause trichinosis, described as ``an uncommon but potentially
serious infection.''

   Consumers with questions about the recall may phone the
toll-free USDA meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555 from 10
a.m. to 4 p.m. EDT, Monday through Friday. Callers in the
metropolitan Washington, D.C., area should call 447-3333.

   The Bush administration's hit list of unfair
trading practices leaves autos off the list of products improperly
excluded from the Japanese market, auto industry and congressional
offices said Thursday.
   The automotive issue, however, will be raised later in
negotiations with Tokyo on trade barriers built into the Japanese
regulatory and marketing system, officials said.
   The list was drawn up as part of a provision in a trade bill
passed last year allowing the government to name countries whose
trade barriers are most harmful to U.S. producers.
   Chrysler Corp., the nation's third largest automaker, said: ``We
are very encouraged that the administration has included
distribution systems in Japan on its list of structural practices
which are key parts of the ongoing trade imbalance.''
   ``Chrysler will, over the next 12 months, aggressively attempt
to fulfill its commitment to break into the Japanese market as we
have in Europe and Taiwan,'' the company said.
   The list named Japan, India and Brazil as nations with
restrictive trade barriers.
   The list of harmful trade practices in Japan named satellites,
supercomputers and forest products as areas that had suffered from
Japanese trading practices and omitted the automotive sector, which
accounts for almost two-thirds of the $55 billion U.S. trade
imbalance with Japan.
   The law requires the administration to identify the most harmful
trade barriers and gives it 18 months to negotiate removal of the
barriers.
   If the talks fail to produce results, the government can levy
tariffs of up to 100 percent against selected imports from an
offending country.
   Automobiles and automotive parts are not on the formal list and
so would not come under the 18-month rule.
   The negotiations on structural barriers don't list automotive
issues specifically. But aides to Sen. Donald Riegle, D-Mich., said
automotive issues would be addressed in trade negotiations with
Japan.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration announced Thursday
that it had targeted trade barriers in Japan, Brazil and India to
meet a new U.S. trade law, a move that could mean huge tariffs
against some foreign products.
   The long-awaited decision was announced by U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills.
   She said the administration was citing Japan for its refusal to
buy U.S. made satellites and supercomputers as well as its barriers
on U.S. lumber products.
   Mrs. Hills said the administration will immediately begin
negotiations with the three countries to try to get the barriers
removed so that any threatened U.S. trade sanctions would be
unnecessary.
   While many foreign nations have bitterly attacked the one-sided
nature of the new U.S. law, Mrs. Hills said she hopes all countries
will understand that America is interested in opening markets
rather than erecting trade barriers in this country.
   ``This exercise is not intended to be offensive. It is intended
to carry out the law Congress passed last year and we in the
administration are sworn to uphold,'' she told a packed news
conference.
   The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issue
a sort of hit list identifying the trade barriers most harmful to
American producers. Once that is done, it has 18 months to
negotiate the removal of the barriers. If the talks are
unsuccessful, the government can levy tariffs of up to 100 percent
against selected imports from an offending country.
   Officials said India would be cited for its restrictions on
foreign investment and foreign insurance companies, while Brazil
would be cited for its import-licensing practices.
   The target countries and key congressional leaders were informed
of the actions several hours before Mrs. Hills' news conference.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont. and chairman of the Senate Finance
subcommittee on international trade, said he was pleased with the
administration's initial response to the requirements in the trade
law.
   ``I think the administration deserves a passing grade. They are
stepping up to the problem,'' Baucus said. ``This is a good start.''
   Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., called the action ``a very positive
first step in utilizing a process which I hope will lead to more
open world markets.''
   But there were critics. Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the author of
an even tougher trade sanctions provision which was ultimately
rejected by Congress last year, said Bush's action was too timid
and the administration had missed a ``golden opportunity to stand
up for American workers and businesses.''
   Nobuo Matsunaga, the Japanese ambassador to the United States,
called the decision ``extremely regrettable'' and said any
sanctions would be strongly opposed by his government.
   ``In light of the good faith efforts that have been made, the
government of Japan and the Japanese people are greatly
disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' Matsunaga said in a
statement. ``There may well be some domestic backlash in Japan
which will make the resolution of the various problems even more
difficult.''
   In addition to listing Japan, India and Brazil for priority
negotiations for flagrant trade barriers, the administration put
eight countries on a ``watch list'' because of their failure to
provide protection for U.S. patents and copyrights.
   The eight countries placed on the watch list were Brazil, India,
Mexico, China, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Taiwan and Thailand,
according to a fact sheet distributed to members of Congress.
   Another 17 countries were cited as deserving ``special
attention'' on the issue of copyright and patent protection with
the administration promising to review progress in negotiations by
Nov. 1.
   Those nations are Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Egypt,
Greece, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Pakistan, the
Philippines, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Venezuela, and Yugoslavia.
   However, by citing no country as a priority violator of
copyrights and patents, the administration avoided triggering the
strict timetables leading to possible sanctions.
   In addition to naming Japan as a priorty trade violator in three
trade areas, the administration also planned to begin negotiations
with Tokyo on so-called structural rigidities within Japan which
impede U.S. sales, Baucus said.
   The trade hit list has stirred anger among U.S. allies who
charge that the unilateral listing by the United States of a
particular nation as an unfair trader violates the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the pact which governs world trade.
   Some nations mounted extensive lobbying efforts to keep from
being named to the list.
   That lobbying effort worked for South Korea, Taiwan and the
12-nation European Community, which were kept off despite having
large trade surpluses with the United States.
   Congressional supporters of the new trade provision, known as
Super 301, mounted their own campaign to make sure the
administration named Japan as a priority nation.
   Japan ran up a trade deficit with the United States of $52
billion last year, accounting for 44 percent of the total deficit
of $119.8 billion, making it a prime target for inclusion on the
trade list.
   While South Korea's deficit of $8.9 billion was among the
largest of any nation, officials from that country had stepped up
efforts in the past weeks to reach agreements on the removal of
various barriers against U.S. products, and the administration
apparently took these concessions into account in making its
determination.
   The Super 301 issue caused a deep split within Bush's Cabinet.
Hills and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher had urged an
aggressive approach to carrying out the law, saying failure to name
several countries as flagrant trade violators risked a
protectionist backlash in Congress.
   However, Michael Boskin, the president's chief economic adviser,
and Budget Director Richard Darman countered that targeting Japan,
America's closest ally in the Pacific, would be harmful to broader
U.S. interests.
   The dispute went public earlier this month when Boskin said in
an appearance before a business group that U.S. efforts to
retaliate against its trading partners could spark a trade war and
lead to a worldwide recession.
   Up until a decision made by President Bush, there was
uncertainty over whether priority nations would be named _ or
simply priority trade practices, which would carry a lesser sting.
   However, those urging the naming of priority countries prevailed
with Bush.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said the administration acted only
after heavy congressional pressure and it would be essential to
keep up that pressure during the mandated negotiations.
   ``Now we have to be sure that the administration follows through
by makin tough but reasonable demands and by getting some wins at
the negotiating table,'' Wyden said.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co., trying to revise its
image and revive sales, on Thursday introduced a men's ``superstore
within a store'' at a suburban outlet.
   Michael Bozic, chairman of Sears Merchandise Group, said the
department will have six different shops with more than 70 national
and Sears brands.
   The shops are young men's sportswear, activewear, classic
sportwear, big and tall, men's furnishings and men's workwear.
   They opened at a Sears in Aurora, west of Chicago, and will
spread through the nation next year, the company said.
   ``We are now examining nearly 400 markets,'' Bozic said. ``And
for each market with the appropriate potential, Sears will install
the superstore in sizes ranging up to 16,500 square feet.''
   Bozic said it is the third in its program. The first, Brand
Central, a home electronics and appliances store, was introduced in
18 Indiana stores last year. The second, Kids &amp; More, was
introduced in a store in Merrillville, Ind., and another in Chicago.
   Similar formats are being developed for women's fashions,
automotive, home improvements and home fashions, Bozic said.

   Pan Am Corp. said Thursday it expects to secure
at least $1.6 billion in financing by next week for its proposed
$3.6 billion bid for NWA Inc., parent of Northwest Airlines.
   In a statement, the parent company of Pan American World Airways
said it was ``in active discussions'' with three major banks to
secure financing and expects to receive final commitments by
Tuesday, the deadline for bids set by NWA.
   Pan Am said it was working with Bankers Trust Co., First
National Bank of Chicago and Security Pacific National Bank of Los
Angeles on its offer for the nation's fourth-largest carrier.
   Earlier, Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett said he would not
seek wage concessions from Northwest Airline employees if his
buyout is successful.
   Plaskett, on a tour to secure backing for a bid, told investors
in a private meeting Wednesday that Pan Am would have financing in
place for an offer by Tuesday's deadline.
   Plaskett said he is not contemplating layoffs of Northwest union
employees, investors who attended the meeting said. Cooperation
from Northwest's unions is considered key to the bid.
   Other likely bidders for Eagan, Minn.-based Northwest include
Los Angeles billionaire Marvin Davis, whose first offer of $2.72
billion was rejected, and an investment group led by financier Al
Checchi.
   After Davis made his bid, the NWA board said it would explore
restructuring alternatives. The board said Thursday it had
appointed a special committee to oversee that process.
   Possible alternatives include acquisition of another company, a
partial or complete liquidation of the airline, a repurchase of
shares, a special dividend or a sale of equity to third parties.
   NWA stock closed Thursday at $104~, down 12{ cents, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   In his meeting with investment fund managers, Plaskett outlined
plans for his bid, which would include sale of high-yield notes
totaling $1.6 billion and bank financing for the rest of the $3.6
billion package.
   He said the offer would be all cash and fully financed.
   Plaskett told investors he plans no sales of operating assets
and no sale or lease-back of existing planes.
   He said he is not assuming any revenue from a sale of
Northwest's Japanese real estate, but expects to save $240 million
by streamlining the new carrier's corporate headquarters, marketing
operation, maintenance and other support services.
   Industry analysts have been cautions about Pan Am's prospects
because of its $900 million in debt, $535 million in outstanding
pension liabilities and continuing losses.
