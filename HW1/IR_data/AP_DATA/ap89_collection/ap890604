   Poles voted Sunday in the freest elections
in the East bloc in 42 years with Solidarity confident of success
and the Communist Party braced for a feared poor showing.
   Poles, living under the communist system since the end of World
War II, began voting at 6 a.m. for a Senate in which Solidarity
candidates are running for all 100 seats.
   Opposition and independent candidates also were allowed to run
for 161 of the 460 seats in the Sejm, or parliament. The polls were
to close at 10 p.m.
   Surveys projected that 80 percent of the nation's 27 million
eligible voters would cast ballots. The national election
commission said final results might not be available until
Wednesday or Thursday.
   Thousands of Polish immigrants filed absentee ballots Saturday
at Polish consulates in New York, Chicago and Washington.
   ``This is pure satisfaction,'' said Jack Piotrowski, 38, of
Butler, N.J., who came to America six years ago and cast his ballot
in New York City.
   ``I'm a bit surprised,'' said Tomasz Zalewski, 41, of Brooklyn,
an official poll watcher for Solidarity. ``I didn't expect such a
turnout.''
   A consular official in New York said 5,000 people had registered
to vote and by 3 p.m. Saturday, 3,500 people had cast ballots. In
Chicago thousands of Poles braved thunderstorms and hourlong waits
to vote.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa was cheered Saturday night at a
tumultuous rally outside his modest home in the port city of
Gdansk. ``We showed the world we can fight, now let's show we can
do things peacefully,'' he said.
   More than 500 cars drove by, filled with Solidarity supporters
who flashed the V-for-victory sign.
   Walesa held a private party at his home before the rally and the
house was filled with well-wishers. President George Bush is
scheduled to have lunch there with Walesa and his family when the
U.S. leader visits Gdansk in July.
   ``This is a rehearsal for Bush's visit,'' Walesa told The
Associated Press with a hearty laugh.
   If 80 percent of the voters cast ballots it will be one of the
highest turnouts in years. A national referendum in 1987 on
political and economic reform drew 67.3 percent of the voters. In
elections in June 1988 for local and provincial councils the
government reported a 56 percent turnout.
   Relatively free elections occurred in Poland in 1947 with some
opposition, but the Communist Party won the balloting and
established complete political control.
   Solidarity has taken numerous steps to try to ensure Sunday's
election is honest.
   Opposition representatives serve on commissions conducting the
elections and Solidarity recruited more than 100,000 poll watchers.
   At Solidarity headquarters Saturday, workers scrambled to
identify polling places and set up an unofficial vote tabulation
system.
   Communist Party leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, in a TV address
Friday night, stressed accommodation and said the party would be
interested in forming a ``broad, post-election coalition.''
   Walesa, an interview taped for broadcast Saturday night, urged
restraint, saying too much emotion could frighten the other side
and ``destroy us.''
   Last-minute campaign skirmishes continued Saturday. A party
spokesman accused Solidarity of rejecting a moratorium on
campaigning Saturday and Sunday.
   But the union denied there was such a proposal, and Solidarity
candidates held rallies as rain drenched Warsaw.
   While the Senate voting is fully democratic, the existing
parliament _ made up of one chamber called the Sejm _ will remain
in the control of the party by virtue of a deal authorities made
with the Solidarity-led opposition on April 5.
   Independent candidates were permitted to run for 161, or 35
percent, of the 460 Sejm seats. The rest were reserved for
candidates from the party and its allies.
   But the party could end up with fewer seats than the 65 percent
expected if voters reject the ``national list'' of 35 prominent
politicians running unopposed. The list includes No. 2 in the
party, Jozef Czyrek, Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski and
Interior Minister Czeslaw Kiszczak.
   If the national list candidates do not receive at least 50
percent of the vote, their seats will not be filled.
   It is possible the communists could have only a three-vote
majority when the Sejm and Senate convene to choose a president
next month.
   Party leaders in the last days of the campaign stressed that the
national list candidates should be elected for the sake of the
April agreement.
   ``When one appeals to cross out the national list, then the
campaign becomes a confrontation,'' party secretary Stanislaw
Ciosek said Saturday.
   Czyrek said rejection of the list could lead to a constitutional
impasse that might have to be resolved in court because the
constitution says the Sejm should have 460 members.
   As part of the April agreement between the government and the
opposition, Solidarity regained legal status after a seven-year ban
imposed during a martial law crackdown in December 1981.

   A former U.S. hostage in Iran said the death of the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini ends a nightmare for the former captives and for
the Islamic republic itself, and opposition figures Sunday
predicted major changes in Iran.
   ``I'm not the type to say I'm happy he's dead,'' said former
hostage Barry Rosen, one of the 52 hostages held 444 days by
radical Iranian students from 1979 to 1981. ``But I do feel, to a
certain degree, that that part of the nightmare is over for us and
for Iran.''
   A former president of the Islamic republic, Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr, likened Khomeini's death to the death of Spanish
dictator Franco, and said it could mean Iran would, like Spain,
turn toward democracy .
   ``The dictatorship is at an impasse in Iran,'' Bani-Sadr said.
``Iran made a revolution for democracy. There is no other solution
for Iran but democracy.''
   Khomeini, 86, died 12 days after undergoing surgery for bleeding
in his digestive system, according to the official Iranian news
agency.
   ``For those Iranians who followed and worshipped him as a
religious leader, it's a tremendous tragedy. But I don't see his
death as a tragedy. I see the tragedy in him coming to power at
that time in Iran's history,'' said Rosen, assistant to the
president of Brooklyn College.
   ``He had his own moral standards. I think he hurt millions of
people not just outside of Iran but many Iranians have died because
of Khomeini. He has caused a lot of pain all over the world,''
Rosen said.
   Bani-Sadr said Khomeini's death opened three possibilities: A
war of succession; power held by a troika of Parliament Speaker
Abolhassan Rafsanjani, President Ali Khamenei and Khomeini's son,
Ahmed Khomeini; or a turn to democracy.
   ``Given the weakness of the regime, I think the turn to
democracy is the most probable,'' Bani-Sadr said, and in that case,
``the death of Khomeini would be like the death of Franco and the
beginning of democracy.''
   Bani-Sadr, speaking from Versailles, outside of Paris, said
Khomeini's death makes it ``very probable'' that he will be able to
return to Iran before long, and possibly become involved again in
government.
   Massoud Rajavi, leader of the rebel People's Mujahadeen of Iran,
predicted that ``very much like the shah's regime'' Iran's
fundamentalist government would not survive the death of its
spiritual leader.
   ``The end of the regime has come and the new era for the freedom
of the Iranian people has started,'' Rajavi said in a radio
broadcast from Iraq that was quoted by Alireza Jafarzadeh, a
spokesman for the resistance group in Washington, D.C.
   Ayatollah Mehdi Rouhani, spiritual leader of the Shiite Moslem
community in Europe, called on Iranian defenders and opponents of
the regime to form a united front.
   ``The ayatollah is dead, but the Iranian people lives,'' he said
in Paris. ``I hope the courage of my people will let them build a
regime more just than today's.''
   The son of the former Shah of Iran predicted trouble in his
homeland, and a U.S. official familiar with policy in Iran said he
did not anticipate ``any drastice change in policy in Tehran'' in
the post-Khomeini era.
   The Washington, D.C.-based official said there was no question
that Iran will remain an Islamic republic. ``But just what kind of
course they're going to take, we'd be just guessing right now.
   ``He was quite a figure for Iran and its revolution. There's
been a power struggle recently, but it's not clear who is on top,''
said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said there were some indications that a collective leadership
would rule Iran while various individuals vied for power.
   Khomeini came to power after months of street protests and
strikes that in February 1979 ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and
ended 2,500 years of monarchy.
   The shah died in 1980. His son, Reza Pahlavi, who has lived in
exile in Europe and the United States as the pretender to the
Peacock Throne, saw trouble ahead.
   ``The shah predicts a period of uncertainty, turmoil and feuding
among the factions,'' said Robert Armao, a spokesman in New York
for the Pahlavi family.
   Armao, an adviser to the late Shah, said security reasons
prohibited his revealing where Reza Pahlavi resides, but said it
was somewhere in the United States.

   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini has died 11 days after undergoing surgery for bleeding in
his digestive system, the official Iranian news agency reported
Sunday. He was 86.
   ``The leader of the Islamic revolution and founder of the
Islamic Republic, Imam Khomeini, passed away at a Tehran
hospital,'' the Islamic Republic News Agency reported in an urgent
dispatch.
   IRNA said the Shiite Moslem leader died Saturday, and that the
body was taken to a mortuary during the night after it had been
``washed and shrouded according to Islamic laws.'' The dispatch was
monitored in Nicosia.
   Neither IRNA nor the official Tehran Radio, which also is
monitored in Nicosia, gave the immediate cause or exact time of his
death.
   The Tehran Radio announcer choked with emotion as he said at 7
a.m. Sunday (11:30 p.m. EDT Saturday): ``Imam Khomeini has passed
away.''
   Khomeini is referred to by Iranians as the imam, or spiritual
leader. He led the 1979 revolution that toppled Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi and set up the Islamic Republic of Iran.
   A 40-day mourning period was declared in Iran, IRNA and the
radio said. The radio said the burial would not take place Sunday
and urged mourners to display discipline and avoid flooding
Khomeini's residence at Jamaran, a Tehran suburb.
   The radio read a statement by President Ali Khamenei, Parliament
Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Chief
Justice Musavi Ardebili that mourned his death but gave no clue who
would succeed him.
   ``How can we believe that our beloved Imam is no longer among
us?'' the statement said. ``Our lives have gone with him.''
   Iran's main opposition group, the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's
Holy Warriors, ``congratulated'' Iranians on his death.
   A statement by the Mujahedeen Khalq leader Massoud Rajavi sent
by telex to The Associated Press from Iraq said Khomeini was ``The
most notorious dictator of recent times.''
   He predicted the Islamic Republic would not survive the death of
its spiritual leader.
   A former president of the Islamic republic, Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr, said Iran would turn toward democracy. ``There is no
other solution for Iran,'' said Bani-Sadr, reached at his home
outside Paris.
   A former U.S. hostage in Iran said the death of Khomeini ends a
nightmare for the former captives.
   ``I'm not the type to say I'm happy he's dead,'' said former
hostage Barry Rosen, one of the hostages held 444 days by radical
Iranian students from 1979 to 1981. ``But I do feel, to a certain
degree, that that part of the nightmare is over for us and for
Iran.''
   Khomeini had prepared a political testament in which he is
believed to have proposed how the country should be governed
following his death.
   The testament, which the official media refer to as the ``divine
political will and testament, was given to parliament in December
1987.
   The radio broadcast recordings from the Koran, canceling all
programs. Newscasts in Farsi, Arabic and Turkish, were limited to
the same one-line announcement and Koranic verse.
   Iran on Saturday had said Khomeini's health was deteriorating
and urged the nation to pray for the country's spiritual leader,
who underwent surgery last month for bleeding in his digestive
system.
   Earlier in the week, the television said a ``slight cardiac
complication'' had arisen May 27, but that it was relieved the next
day.
   Khomeini had been reported ailing since he suffered a heart
attack in 1986. Since then he was rarely seen outside his home.
   Political turmoil has gripped the country since Khomeini
launched a radical resurgence in February with his death decree
against British author Salman Rushdie for allegedly blaspheming
against Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A purge of Iranians who apparently favored rebuilding ties with
the West followed.
   Khomeini in March ousted his designated successor, Ayatollah
Hussein Ali Montazeri, 64, who had openly criticized the regime's
shortcomings, and then appointed a 20-member committee to review
the succession.
   But in the absence of a single personality who could match the
patriarch's political and revolutionary authority, there was
widespread speculation that Iran may be ruled by a collective
leadership.
   Khomeini was born Sept. 23, 1902, the son of a religious leader
from a village southwest of Tehran. After a formal Islamic
education he taught for years at Qom, the center of Shiite learning
in Iran.
   His stern morality made him a focus for opposition to the
monarchy in Iran. He spent years in exile after he was banished in
November 1964, first in Turkey, then in Iraq, where he settled in
the Shiite shrine city of Najaf. He later moved to France.
   Khomeini emerged in 1978 as the spiritual leader of a burgeoning
revolution against the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi that was
organized through Iran's Shiite clergymen and their followers.
   He returned to Tehran in February 1979 after the shah had fled
the country and Khomeini became the supreme head of Iran's Islamic
revolution for life.
   Khomeini often spoke out against the ``world-devouring''
governments _ the United States and the Soviet Union _ that sought
to influence Iran. On Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian militants calling
themselves followers of Khomeini seized the U.S. embassy and 52
hostages.
   By the time the hostages were all freed in January 1981,
moderates who advocated links with the outside world were ousted
and Khomeini's hard-line views had prevailed.
   Khomeini is survived by a wife, three daughters and a son, Ahmed.

   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder
of Iran's Islamic Republic, died in a Tehran hospital at age 86,
and Iran's Parliament met in emergency session Sunday to read his
final plans for the nation's future.
   Khomeini died Saturday with the question of who will succeed him
unresolved. Iranian opposition leaders in exile said the country
could be plunged into political turmoil.
   Hundreds of thousands of Iranians dressed in black converged on
Khomeini's residence in the north Tehran suburb of Jamaran after
news of his death was announced.
   Tehran television, monitored in Nicosia, showed men and women
clad in head-to-toe black chadors beating on their heads and chests
hysterically in a traditional show of grief.
   Many waved life-size portraits of their revolutionary patriarch.
Others chanted: ``Sorrow, sorrow is this day ... Khomeini the idol
smasher is with God this day.''
   State-run television screened old films of the black-turbaned,
white-bearded Khomeini on his return from exile in 1979, addressing
crowds of worshippers, or lying in his hospital bed after
undergoing an operation May 23 for bleeding in his digestive system.
   Tehran radio blared readings from the Koran, Islam's holy book
as the country began its 40-day mourning decreed by Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi's Cabinet.
   Khomeini's office did not say when the patriarch will be buried,
but the official Islamic Republic News Agency said ``it will not
take place today (Sunday),'' despite a Moslem tradition to bury the
dead the day they die or the following day at the latest.
   IRNA and the other media did not disclose the immediate cause of
death.
   Iran's 270-seat Parliament convened in an emergency session to
read a political testament Khomeini had written, apparently to
outline how the Islamic republic should be governed after his death.
   The political testament, which the official media in Iran
describe as the ``divine political will and testament,'' was read
during an almost three-hour meeting of Parliament, IRNA said.
   Khomeini's son, Ahmad, 43, was to read the entire 20-page text
later. It was unclear what it contained or whether it named a
successor.

   Floods and landslides killed at least
171 people and forced more than 25,000 to flee their homes in the
hills of central Sri Lanka, police said Sunday.
   The pre-dawn landslides, touched off by heavy rains, wiped out
entire hamlets, Kegalle police chief Madumma Banda said. The rains
had eased by late afternoon Sunday but continued to hamper search
operations.
   The hardest-hit area appeared to be the tea plantation region
around Kegalle, 45 miles northeast of Colombo on the road leading
to the Buddhist religious center and resort town of Kandy.
   ``We have counted 163 bodies so far. Maybe some more are buried
under mud,'' Banda said when contacted by telephone. The road
between Colombo and Kegalle was blocked by landslides.
   He said landslides occurred in at least 10 areas of the Kegalle
district.
   At least 30 people died in Bulathkopitiya, 10 miles south of
Kegalle, when the entire village was buried under mud and dirt,
Banda said.
   He said six other people died Saturday in floods in the Kegalle
area.
   Two people were killed Sunday when rain-loosened boulders
crushed them at Nuwara Eliya, a resort town 60 miles east of
Colombo.
   Kegalle reported eight inches rain on Saturday.

   An Israeli soldier and three Arab guerrillas
died in a clash on the Lebanese border Sunday, the Israeli army
said.
   Two soldiers also were wounded in the confrontation, the army
said.
   The guerrillas belonged to the Damascus-based Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine, the army said in a statement.
   The soldiers encountered the guerrillas just north of the Misgav
Am collective farm, the army said.
   ``In the firefight, the troops destroyed the terrorist force,''
the statement said. ``One soldier was killed.''
   The soldier was identified by the army as First Sgt. Maj. Hassin
Muktaren, a Bedouin Arab from the northern village Kfar Subuch.
   The army did not say how many troops or guerrillas were involved
in the clash. No further details were immediately available.
   It was the fourth infiltration attempt into Israel or its south
Lebanon security zone in eight days.
   Israel created the security zone in 1985 as a buffer for its
border after withdrawing most of its forces. The zone is patrolled
by Israeli soldiers and the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army
militia.
   The soldier was Israel's first fatality on the Israel-Lebanon
border in seven months.

   A spring rain washed the blood off Tiananmen
Square on Sunday, but it will take far longer to remove the stain
of one of the most shameful acts in Communist China's history.
   The killing of hundreds of unarmed citizens in a military
blitzkrieg against the student-occupied square could leave China
permanently changed.
   The senseless carnage, in the short run, could usher in a new
dark age of political repression.
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping already has ousted Communist Party
chief Zhao Ziyang for refusing to go along with the crackdown on
the pro-democracy movement. Now, having taken the irretrievable
step of ordering in troops to ensure his political supremacy, Deng
is likely to extend the purge to a broad range of those supporting
Zhao's more moderate policies.
   Academics, artists and writers who in past months have spoken
out for greater democracy and condemned the power abuses of the
Communist Party may face ostracism, persecution or even arrest.
   After much smaller pro-democracy demonstrations in the winter of
1986-87, Deng launched a numbing campaign against ``bourgeois
liberalization,'' or Western ideas, that lasted for months. This
time the repression could be harsher and last longer.
   While the Soviet Union, Poland and other socialist countries
flirt boldly with free elections, China will retreat to the
socialist dogma that so many of its own people regard with disdain.
   But in the longer run, the slaughter on Tiananmen will come to
haunt Deng and the Old Guard ideologues.
   The students struck a common chord with millions of workers by
demanding an end to the privileges and corruption associated with
the Communist Party. The shooting of workers will increase
disenchantment with the party, and could lead to the social unrest
Deng was trying to eradicate by smashing the student protests.
   Deng's market-oriented economic reforms, his great achievement
over the past decade, could be seriously undermined if a power
struggle leaves Chinese leaders incapable of dealing with such
critical issues as 30 percent inflation and widespread profiteering.
   Political instability will also lead to a drop in foreign
investment and tourism, two sources of foreign exchange that China
badly needs for its modernization drive.
   Premier Li Peng, while triumphing over old rival Zhao by siding
with Deng, is now easily the most hated man in China because he
declared martial law in Beijing.
   If the party elders decide that someone must be made a scapegoat
to remove the public venom over Tiananmen, Li is the prime
candidate.
   The People's Liberation Army, one of China's few official bodies
to have always had the trust and respect of the Chinese people, has
been badly tainted by the butchery of its attack on the people of
Beijing.
   ``Even Hitler and the Japanese troops during World War II didn't
act like that,'' said one enraged Beijing citizen.
   The People's Liberation Army was known to be sharply divided
about imposing martial law in Beijing. After the violence, those
divisions are sure to deepen.
   With all these variables, the position of the conservatives is
anything but secure. Deng and the other old guard Communists are in
their 80s, and as evidenced by the Tiananmen attack, are losing
their grip on the realities of China.
   The Chinese people, after 10 years of impressive economic gains
and a policy of opening to the outside world, know that China's
socialist system is outdated and unworkable, and are eager to learn
from the West.
   The students' ``Goddess of Democracy'' statue on Tiananmen may
have been bulldozed by army tanks Sunday, but the movement for a
freer and fairer society is sure to rise again.

   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' were the heavy favorites Sunday to win the top 1989
Tony Awards honoring a Broadway season that was short on quality
and quantity, particularly in the area of new musicals.
   ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway,'' the season's biggest hit, received
10 nominations, including best musical. Robbins himself was
nominated as best director of a musical for his work on the show, a
parade of dance numbers from many of his greatest successes,
including ``West Side Story,'' ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' ``Gypsy,''
``The King and I'' and ``Peter Pan.''
   Its minimal competition for best musical were ``Black and
Blue,'' a tap-dancing and blues revue, and ``Starmites,'' a campy,
comic strip adventure.
   ``The Heidi Chronicles,'' Wendy Wasserstein's baby-boom saga,
should add the best play Tony to its list of honors, which already
include the Pulitzer Prize, the New York Drama Critics' Circle
award and the Drama Desk award.
   Also nominated for best play were ``Lend Me a Tenor,'' a farce
by Ken Ludwig about an indisposed opera star; ``Shirley
Valentine,'' a one-woman comedy by Willy Russell about an
unfulfilled English housewife, and ``Largely New York,'' clown Bill
Irwin's wordless entertainment that has him battling video
technology.
   The acting competition is short of big box-office names. Only
ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov, nominated for his transformation
from man to bug in ``Metamorphosis,'' his first stage-acting role,
can be considered a superstar. Also vying for the award for best
actor in a play were Victor Garber and Philip Bosco, both of ``Lend
Me a Tenor,'' and Irwin.
   The best-actress nominees were better known. They included
Madeline Kahn, for playing Billie Dawn in Garson Kanin's classic
``Born Yesterday''; Joan Allen, the heroine of ``The Heidi
Chronicles''; Pauline Collins, who plays the title character in
``Shirley Valentine,'' and Kate Nelligan of ``Spoils of War,''
which closed in December.

   The 1988-89 season was a mixed year for Broadway. Although box
office receipts climbed to a record $262 million, attendance
slipped slightly and the number of new productions dropped to 30, a
new low.
   There was a paucity of musicals _ six, compared with 12 the
previous year _ and only ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' generated
much demand at the box office. It also had Broadway's highest
priced ticket _ $55 for an orchestra or front mezzanine seat. Among
the notable flops were ``Legs Diamond,'' ``Chu Chem'' and ``Welcome
to the Club.''
   Recognizing the lack of good musicals, the Tony nominating
committee eliminated two categories _ best book and score of a
musical. ``Jerome Robbins' Broadway'' and ``Black and Blue''
received more than one nomination in several categories.
   The production of new plays increased to 12, up four from the
1987-88 season, and the number of revivals tripled, from three to
nine.
   But much of Broadway's grosses over the past year were derived
from long-running shows, including ``The Phantom of the Opera,''
``Les Miserables,'' ``Cats,'' ``Anything Goes'' and ``Me and My
Girl.''
   The 43rd annual Tony Awards show, televised live from the
Lunt-Fontanne Theater, was presented by the League of American
Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing.
   The winners were selected by 750 members of the theater
community and theater journalists. The Tonys are named for
Antoinette Perry, who was a leading force in the American Theater
Wing during World War II.

   The sky flickers orange and black over the bridge
at Muxidi as flames roll through two buses. Bullets whistle and
zing. Tear gas canisters boom. ``Fascists! Fascists!'' chants the
crowd.
   The People's Liberation Army has entered Beijing to liberate the
city from the people.
   Bloodied residents, sprawled on three-wheeled pedicabs, are
pushed howling in pain up side streets where ill-equipped doctors
pound on chests. The doctors' mouths are already red with blood
from mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
   ``He's gone, we've lost him!'' one medic yells as a man with a
bullet hole in his chest gurgles and shakes.
   ``This is China! This is my country!'' screams another man as he
points down the street where soldiers crouch and fire from the
shadows.
   Two weeks after martial law was declared to suppress a popular
movement for democracy and freedom, China's troops late Saturday
burst through barricades erected by the protesters, unleashing a
terror in the capital unknown in 40 years of Communist rule.
   Hundreds of people were killed during the massacre, which
continued through the day as city residents stubbornly refused to
surrender the city to the army.
   Saturday evening and into Sunday, Muxidi bridge, a gateway to
the inner city, was the site of pitched battles. Local citizens
sought to defend themselves from heavily armed Chinese troops
instructed to quell the unrest.
   Soldiers with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles fired indiscriminantly
into crowds of demonstrators and onlookers. Many died, one at the
feet of this reporter. The local hospital laid out 21 bodies in a
makeshift mortuary Sunday afternoon to commemorate the heavy loss
of life.
   Soldiers also were hurt. Two from a tank crew were beaten
senseless by a crowd that attacked the tank with Molotov cocktails.
Civilians briefly commandeered the tank before setting it ablaze.
Red flags reading ``Democracy'' and ``Freedom,'' flapped from its
turrets.
   This is how one battle unfolded:

<TEXT>
   Saturday, 8 p.m.:
   Two buses stand as barricades on the bridge. A steelworker who
has joined the uprising stands nearby. Blood soaks his shirt. A
bandage covers one eye.
   ``We moved those two buses on the bridge to block it good,'' he
says.
   ``I was in the front waiting to fight them. The troop trucks
were west of the bridge, about 100 (yards) away. (They) had their
lights on so we couldn't see anything. When they hit me I didn't
know what was happening. Three guys with sticks and a rifle just
moved in on me and smashed away.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   10 p.m.:
   Workers and students have pushed back the first wave of incoming
troops, who charged them with sticks and tear gas. Burning rugs
from a nearby apartment have been chucked onto the buses. One gas
tank explodes and then another.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   11 p.m.:
   ``Live fire! Live fire!'' a student shouts moments after he's
hit in the leg by a bullet. Soldiers fire into the crowd.
   They are shooting low, hitting many in the legs and stomach.
Blood, pooling on the pavement, splatters the bridge at Muxidi.
   The night, balmy with a calm breeze, echoes with the explosion
of blank shells. The blank rounds send the crowds fleeing up a
nearby side street. They quickly return, rocks in hand to face the
oncoming troops.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Midight:
   Armored personnel carriers are smashing through buses. Soldiers
fire into the crowd.
   ``Clear the street, clear the way,'' yells a medic.
   Li Fengde, a 28-year-old electrical worker, has been hit in the
stomach.
   ``Look at me and think,'' he says as he lies groaning on a
three-wheeled pedicab with another wounded man who is silent. ``I
love the student movement and democracy. This is what I get.''
   The troop trucks have come. A row of fifty storm through the
crumpled roadblock.
   Stones still fly from the citizens, huddled now in bushes and
behind walls near the bridge.
   A housecleaner on the 14th floor of one building is killed by
gunfire as she looks out the window. Another woman is hit by a
shell as she looks out from an eighth-floor balcony.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Sunday, 5 a.m:
   With a horrible explosion, an electric trolley, driven by a man
in a white headband, crashes into a tank as it crosses Muxidi
bridge.
   ``Running dogs!'' the people scream as they attack fleeing
soldiers.
   Machine gunfire crackles as troops react to rocks and insults
with deadly fusilades. Many fall.
   A youth jumps on an abandoned tank.
   ``I can drive this thing!'' he shouts. ``I can drive anything!''
   Comrades join him, placing their flags in its machine gun
turrets.
   Haltingly, the tank begins to move. People in the crowd emerge
from their hiding places to cheer.
   ``Stand up and fight,'' they yell. ``Blood for blood, avenge the
deaths.''
   Under attack from soldiers, the youths withdraw. A gas bomb
explodes.
   Through the yellow flames, the outlines of hundreds more troop
trucks, each carrying upwards of 50 soldiers, move steadily toward
the bridge at Muxidi.

   They lay on filthy mattresses caked with dried
blood, their clothes torn, bandages hastily applied to bullet
wounds.
   A grim story of carnage emerged as victims from Sunday's
violence in Beijing recalled the People's Liberation Army shooting,
clubbing and even strangling its way through a sea of unarmed
protesters.
   ``A girl in the crowd heard that her younger brother had been
killed, and lost her composure and ran toward the soldiers,'' a
teacher from the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute said.
   ``We tried to stop her, but the troops opened fire. They shot
her seven times, even as she was crawling,'' said the teacher, who
was treated at Beijing Union Medical College Hospital for a grazed
ankle.
   The hospital's overloaded surgery department put patients on
dusty hallway floors, some with intravenous drips dangling from
makeshift stands, all with bloody bandages.
   ``A 4-year-old girl was killed by a bullet as she held her
mother's hand,'' said a doctor at the hospital, a few blocks from
Tiananmen Square. A nurse told of a young worker bicycling to work
in the pre-dawn hours who was shot dead in his tracks. ``His
mother's upstairs. She can't stop sobbing,'' she said.
   Hundreds of pro-democracy protesters and curious bystanders were
killed early Sunday as the Chinese army swept through the square to
root out students in the third week of a sit-in.
   ``We have people shot in the head, chest, stomach, legs, even
the eyes,'' said another nurse as she gave an injection to a
27-year-old student whose lower leg was shattered by a bullet.
   ``The government is so rotten,'' said the student, his shirt
drenched with the blood of another youth standing next to him who
was shot in the head. ``They don't care how many people die.''
   The student, like the doctors and other victims interviewed,
would not let their names be used. ``If they're so quick to shoot
us, what else do you think they would do?'' he said.
   All those interviewed said troops fired indiscriminately,
sometimes in response to jeering protesters, sometimes without
provocation.
   ``As soon as they'd see us they'd shoot,'' a young office worker
said. ``They were shouting, `Charge!'''
   A 28-year-old woman who works at the Beijing City Office was
shot in the back as she fled approaching soldiers. ``I just went
down to see what all the excitement was. I wasn't even near the
square,'' she whispered. ``I heard gunfire close by and started
running. Then I got hit in my shoulder and collapsed.''
   She said two victims on either side of her who died before
sunrise were taken away and quickly replaced by others needing
treatment.
   ``I was lying on a sidewalk to stay out of the street when
soldiers beat me with their rifle butts,'' a young publishing house
employee said. ``The guy next to me was shot at close range in his
stomach.''
   Several patients displayed their X-rays, some showing slugs
still lodged in place. All of them implored an American reporter to
``report the truth'' about the Tiananmen violence.
   Outside the hospital, about 100 people clamored for news of
missing friends and relatives. One doctor said he handled the body
of a man in his mid-20s who had been choked to death by metal
chains the soldiers had hidden in their hats for crowd control.
   ``It's just repulsive the lengths they went to,'' he said.

   China's official press Sunday called the military
raid on Tiananmen Square a ``glorious'' victory over
counterrevolutionary turmoil but made no mention of the human
carnage that accompanied it.
   The one exception to the news blackout on civilian casualties
was a maverick announcer for Radio Beijing's English-language
service, who reported that troops firing indiscriminately had
killed thousands of people, mostly innocent civilians.
   The unidentified announcer, in a broadcast monitored in
Washington, asked listeners to protest ``the most barbarous
suppression of the people.'' He was later replaced by another
announcer repeating the government line.
   That line was that the military attack on the city, during which
hundreds of people were killed, had ``suppressed a
counterrevolutionary riot'' and was a ``great victory in the
struggle to end turmoil in the capital.''
   Announcers on national television, reading from editorials in
the official Liberation Army Daily and Xinhua News Agency, blamed
the violence on a ``gang of robbers ... bent on throwing the whole
country into confusion.''
   The army daily said the rioters attempted to ``beat up and
kidnap army men, kill and injure our cadres and fighters, smash and
burn military trucks, loot weapons and ammunition, storm (Communist
Party headquarters) and the Great Hall of the People, rob shops and
burn down buildings.''
   It said the riots exposed the plots of a few and their
``sinister attempt to oppose the Communist Party's leadership and
the socialist system.''
   Xinhua said three soldiers were killed and more than 1,000
injured by ``thugs'' who burned and smashed 31 military trucks, 23
police cars, two armored vehicles and 31 buses.
   The official news agency also accused the independent student
union and autonomous trade union that sprung up during the
seven-week democratic movement of issuing butcher knives, daggers,
iron chains and other weapons to people in Tiananmen Square.
   The reports gave no casualty figures for civilians and did not
mention that the army, breaking a government vow that troops would
not be used on student demonstrators, fired indiscriminately into
crowds.
   The accounts were in sharp contrast to those of several weeks
ago, when Chinese journalists buoyed by the democracy movement
enjoyed a brief moment of freedom to report objectively on the
protests. Many joined the movement for reforms and demanded a freer
press.
   However, as party hardliners gained the edge in a power struggle
sparked by the student unrest, the press quickly returned to its
role as the propaganda medium for party policy.
   The television broadcast, reading a notice from the Beijing
municipal government, said soldiers and police ``strictly observed
discipline'' and said ``their heroic acts and glorious exploits
have won fervent praise and strong support from the masses of
students and citizens.''

   Tens of thousands of people rallied on a race
track Sunday to mourn the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in
Beijing and denounce the communist government that will take over
this British colony in eight years.
   Two lawmakers, in a protest of the slaughter, announced they
would boycott meetings being held between officials in China and
Hong Kong to arrange the transition to Chinese sovereignity.
   Dissidents also called for a general strike Wednesday to show
sympathy for the suppressed masses in China.
   In Macao, southwest of Hong Kong, an estimated 150,000 residents
_ one-quarter of the population in the Portuguese colony _
demonstrated for four hours, shouting slogans and waving banners
that denounced Li and Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Many wept at the Hong Kong rally as they watched televised
scenes or listened to news dispatches from the Chinese capital,
where soldiers crushed a pro-democracy sit-in and killed hundreds
of people.
   Some protesters wore black or white clothes, the traditional
Chinese funeral attire, and carried black flags and placards
denouncing the Chinese leadership and the People's Liberation Army.
   Organizers estimated about 200,000 people were at the rally at
the Hong Kong Jockey Club. The demonstrators listened to
pro-democracy speeches, then marched to the central business
district for another rally. Many others joined the march along the
way.
   Several demonstrations have been held in Hong Kong to support
the seven-week series of protests in Beijing. Under an accord, Hong
Kong is to revert to Chinese sovereignty in 1997, and many Hong
Kong residents are worried that this bastion of free trade will be
smothered by communist suppression.
   On May 28, a crowd estimated at about 1.5 million _ one-quarter
of the population _ marched in what was described as the largest
protest rally in the territory's history.
   Hong Kong's residents, 98 percent of them Chinese, have long
been nervous about their future under Chinese rule. The suppression
of the democracy movement has increased their anxiety.
   Under a Sino-British agreement signed in 1984, China promised to
preserve Hong Kong's free-wheeling society and economy for 50 years
under a ``one country, two systems'' concept that would allow
capitalism to exist under communism in a government run by Hong
Kong people without Chinese interference.
   However, Hong Kong's Chinese population, two-thirds of them
refugees from China or their descendants, are skeptical about the
promises.
   At the rally, two outspoken members of the lawmaking Legislative
Council, Martin Lee and Szeto Wah, announced they will not attend
future meetings of a committee drafting a constitution under which
China will rule Hong Kong.
   ``We are not resigning,'' Lee told the rally. ``We have decided
we cannot work for a government which is against the people. We
will not draft the (constitution) until China has a government that
is widely supported by the people.''
   Two other members of the committee, newspaper publisher Louis
Cha and the Anglican Bishop of Hong Kong, Rev. Peter Kwong,
resigned from the committee after Premier Li imposed martial law in
the Chinese capital on May 20.
   The committee is composed of Hong Kong and Chinese officials
appointed by China.
   At the local office of China's official Xinhua News Agency, the
mainland government's unofficial embassy in the British colony,
protesters plastered posters on the wall, including a rebuke of the
People's Liberation Army that said: ``Hey, hey PLA, how many kids
have you killed today?''

   Iranian rebels in Iraq are ready to return
to their homeland to overthrow the Tehran government following the
death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, a rebel official said Sunday.
   Farid Sulaimani, spokesman of the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's
Holy Warriors, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview
that the movement's military wing, the National Liberation Army of
Iran, was on maximum alert at its bases along the border.
   But there was no immediate indication that the rebels, Iran's
main opposition group, planned any military action during the
political uncertainty in Iran following Khomeini's death Saturday.
   Any military move would have to be with Iraqi approval. It was
not thought likely that Baghdad would permit any action that would
jeopardize its 10-month-old truce in the war with Iran.
   Sulaimani declined comment on what moves the Mujahedeen may be
planning.
   ``We're continuing our vigilance and closely monitoring the
situation in Iran after Khomeini's death,'' he said.
   ``Great joy prevailed in our bases along the border, and all our
fighters expressed readiness to move in when the appropriate moment
comes,'' he reported.
   Suliamani said the Mujahedeen would have preferred to see
Khomeini live until they overthrew him and put him on trial ``for
the crimes he committed against the Iranian people.
   ``But now he's gone, what remains is the overthrow of his
regime,'' he declared.
   He said the opposition movement was optimistic Khomeini's death
will pave the way for ``a free, democratic and stable Iran.''
   The rebel army, which has an estimated 20,000 fighters, has been
on alert since Tehran announced Khomeini had undergone surgery to
stop intenstinal bleeding.
   Mujahedeen leader Massoud Rajavi, in a statement issued Sunday
in Baghdad, called on Iranians to ``confront the illegitimate
remnants of the Khomeini regime by all available means to prepare .
.. for the final eradicating blow to the criminal executioners and
until the appropriate time for the National Liberation Army to move
in.''
   He said Khomeini's death signals the collapse of the cleric-led
Tehran government.
   ``This is a very important turning point,'' he said. ``Iran is
now in a state of extreme agitation.''
   Military and political analysts do not believe the rebel army is
strong enough to topple the Tehran government alone.
   But if a power struggle emerges in the post-Khomeini era, as
many analysts have predicted, the rebels might be able to tip the
balance between the rival factions.
   Khomeini's March 28 dismissal of his designated successor,
Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, was largely because of Montazeri's
sympathy for the opposition movement.
   The rebel army fought alongside the Iraqis against Iran during
the eight-year Persian Gulf war, which ended with a tentative truce
in August. The two nations still are deadlocked on terms of a
permanent peace accord.
   Weeks before the cease-fire, the rebel army launched its biggest
operation into western Iran, reaching 90 miles inside the Islamic
republic before withdrawing.
   Iran claimed the rebels were driven back with heavy losses.
Still, the raid so deep inside Iran alarmed Tehran.
   Mujahedeen officials have said that since the cease-fire, their
army's strength has increased considerably and months of intensive
training in Iraq have forged it into ``a far more effective
military force than it was before.''
   The Mujahedeen were allied with Khomeini in the struggle to
topple the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   But radicals turned on the Mujahedeen and other liberal factions
in 1980-81, killing and imprisoning tens of thousands of people.

   Most Americans oppose the strict confidentiality
of AIDS tests, favoring mandatory notification of spouses and
health officials when the infection is discovered, a national poll
has found.
   Many public health officials say AIDS tests should be kept
confidential to encourage people to be tested. In the poll,
however, 72 percent said the spouse or sexual partner of a person
found to have AIDS should be told.
   Additionally, 67 percent in the Media General-Associated Press
survey said the doctor administering the test should be required to
notify local or state public health officials of a finding of AIDS
infection.
   Mandatory notification of other people or agencies got less
support. Just four in 10 said doctors should have to report
positive tests to the federal government or to insurance companies,
and three in 10 said employers should be told.
   The survey of 1,084 adults was done in advance of the Fifth
International Conference on AIDS, which opened Sunday in Montreal.
It found the disease has touched the lives of a sizable minority of
Americans: Nearly one in five said they personally know someone who
is infected with AIDS or who has died of it.
   Most felt they were at no risk personally of getting AIDS, and
respondents were split on whether AIDS is likely to spread widely
outside known risk groups _ homosexuals and intravenous drug
abusers and their sexual partners.
   Still, majorities said they would pay higher taxes for AIDS
research and treatment. Nearly all favored AIDS education in the
schools, and 81 percent said pupils should be told that using
condoms can prevent AIDS infection.
   The poll also found growing social acceptance of AIDS patients.
Three-quarters said people with AIDS should be entitled to keep
their jobs, and nearly eight in 10 said children who have AIDS
should be admitted to school _ twice as many as held that view in
polls four years ago.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that
damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to
infections and cancer. AIDS is spread most often through sexual
contact, tainted hypodermic needles and infected blood and from
pregnant women to their offspring. An estimated 5 million people
worldwide are infected, and no cure is known.
   Fifty-two percent in the poll thought AIDS was likely to spread
widely beyond current risk groups. At the same time, just 11
percent thought they were at great risk or some risk of getting
AIDS; 23 percent felt ``not much risk'' and 64 percent said ``no
risk at all.'' Two percent were unsure.
   Of those who thought they could get AIDS, three in 10 said they
have changed their sexual behavior to lessen the odds.
   Half overall favored passage of a federal law prohibiting
discrimination against people with AIDS. Other federal efforts won
favor: Six in 10 said they would pay higher taxes for government
spending on AIDS research and 56 percent said would accept a tax
increase for treatment of AIDS patients.
   Eight in 10 said the government should allow AIDS patients to
take experimental drugs that have not been fully tested and
approved as safe. And half favored giving free sterilized needles
to drug abusers if such a move would curb AIDS.
   In most gauges, people ages 18 to 44 supported anti-AIDS efforts
in greater numbers than did their elders. More educated respondents
also were more apt to favor anti-AIDS programs and to accept AIDS
patients at work and school.
   Finally, 55 percent said they would agree to answer detailed
questions about their sexual behavior for a confidential federal
study. The Public Health Service had hoped to study the spread of
AIDS by asking thousands of Americans such questions, but the
survey is being rewritten at the behest of conservative congressmen
who objected to its contents.
   The poll, conducted May 5-13, had a 3-point margin of error.

   This Media General-Associated Press poll is
based on telephone interviews May 5-13 with 1,084 adults in the
continental United States. Phone numbers were selected randomly and
interviews were conducted with the adult who had the most recent
birthday.
   The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the
sample. The poll has a 3-point margin of error, meaning that 19
times out of 20 its findings should be within 3 points of the
result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The
error margin is larger for subgrou
   There are other sources of potential error or variations in
polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the
questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100:
   1. Do you think people who are infected with the AIDS virus
should be entitled to keep their jobs as long as they can do their
work, or should employers have the right to fire them? Keep jobs:
76. Fire: 12. Don't know or no answer: 12.
   2. Do you think children who are infected with the AIDS virus
should be allowed to attend regular school classes, or not? Yes:
78. No: 13. DK-NA: 9.
   3. Should the federal government pass a law prohibiting
discrimination against people who are infected with the AIDS virus,
or not? Yes: 51. No: 39. DK-NA: 10.
   4. If giving intravenous drug abusers free needles would slow
down the spread of AIDS, would you favor or oppose giving addicts
sterilized needles for free? Favor: 50. Oppose: 43. DK-NA: 7.
   5. Do you think the government should allow people who have AIDS
to be treated with experimental drugs that have not been fully

   Iraqis, who held Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini responsible for the Iran-Iraq war, on Sunday cheered the
news of his death and expressed hope Iran now will sign a peace
treaty to end the war.
   ``We're not rejoicing for his death, but for the 10-year-old
nightmare that is now over,'' said Abdul Karim Subhi, 45, a
schoolteacher.
   Like him, many Iraqis considered Khomeini the main obstacle in
peace talks that have been deadlocked almost since the start of an
Aug. 20 cease-fire that halted fighting in the war.
   Western analysts estimate that 1 million people were killed in
the war, which began in September 1980, the year after Khomeini
came to power.
   Khomeini, 86, died Saturday in a hospital in Tehran. Many Iraqis
who lost family members in the war shouted for joy when Baghdad
Radio reported the news Sunday morning.
   The state radio cut into its normal programs to broadcast cheery
songs in Arabic, but there was no official comment from the
government, which provided refuge to Khomeini part of the time he
lived in exile.
   ``The imposter has perished!'' yelled Um Khalil, a 63-year-old
woman whose son died in the war.
   ``To hell with him,'' she repeated over and over as she ran
around banging on neighbors' doors to tell them the news. Other
families telephoned each other to break the news.
   Iraqis have long blamed Khomeini for keeping the war going even
after Iraq offered peace in 1985. Khomeini did not agree to the
U.N.-mediated cease-fire until July, after a series of battlefield
disasters and a year after Iraq agreed to the cease-fire.
   Iraq invaded Iran on Sept. 20, 1988, but the Iraqis claim Iran
had started the war weeks earlier by shelling border areas after
months of agitation and subversion.
   Iraq's leaders have said that feuding among rival politicians in
Iran has stalled the peace talks.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
doubted Khomeini's death would have any immediate effect on the
talks.
   ``It will take the Iranian leaders at least a few months to
settle their internal struggle before they can discuss the peace
talks,'' one said.
   Khomeini lived in the Shiite Moslem holy city of Najaf, 100
miles south of Baghdad, for about 15 years after he was exiled from
Iran by the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in 1964.
   But President Saddam Hussein, at the request of the shah,
ordered Khomeini out of Iraq in 1978.
   Khomeini was bitter toward Saddam after that, and the hostility
was seen as one factor in his repeated refusal to end the war.
   Although most of Iraq's 16 million people are Shiite _ like the
overwhelming majority of Iranians _ they rejected Khomeini's
repeated calls to rise up against Saddam, a Sunni Moslem.
   Iraq's official media gave prominent coverage to Khomeini's
illness.
   News of Khomeini's death came too late for Sunday's editions of
Iraqi newspapers.
   But the al-Thawra daily, the newspaper of the ruling Baath
Socialist Party, reported in a front-page headline Sunday:
``Khomeini is on the brink of his grave.''

   He was a reclusive, frail, dour-faced clergyman, a monkish
Moslem little versed in the affairs of state. But Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini toppled a king, stunned a superpower and shook
the world with his message of Moslem piety and might.
   Tehran radio reported early Sunday that Khomeini died in a
hospital in the Iranian capital, 12 days after undergoing surgery
for intenstinal bleeding. He was 86.
   Through years of war and internal turmoil, the Iranian leader's
magnetism held his country's Islamic revolution together.
   As the absolute ``guide'' of Iran's 10-year-old revolutionary
government, he condoned the seizure of 52 U.S. Embassy hostages in
Tehran, waged war on Iraq and blessed the executions of tens of
thousands of Iranians _ dissidents and sinners, prostitutes, drug
dealers and users, adulterers and other violators of the Islamic
code.
   ``God preserve Khomeini until the return of the 12th imam,''
pleaded a banner in Tehran, referring to the promised messiah of
Iran's Shiite Moslem religion, of whom Khomeini was held to be
representative on Earth.
   Khomeini's enemies predicted the Islamic revolutionary
government would die with him.
   ``The regime's existing contradictions will lose their sole axis
of unity .. and be raised to the explosive level,'' said one
anti-Khomeini group.
   Khomeini and his followers labored to make Iran's unique brand
of religious rule permanent.
   ``We may have different viewpoints, but we must all keep
together,'' Khomeini told the Iranian Cabinet in October 1985.
   But in March 1989, Khomeini dumped the man chosen by the
83-member Assembly of Experts as his successor in 1985, Ayatollah
Hussein-Ali Montazeri, leaving the field open to rival candidates
or a collective leadership.
   As the exiled voice of opposition to Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi,
Khomeini spurred Iranians into months of street protests and
strikes that in February 1979 finally ended 2,500 years of monarchy.
   In power, Khomeini looked beyond Iran's borders, full of zeal to
convert other lands to his brand of religious fundamentalism and
mobilize Islam into a powerful world force.
   ``We should ... awaken the people of the world if we want to
export the revolution,'' he declared in a speech in October 1981.
   He was an unlikely leader, often ailing, quiet-spoken, appearing
infrequently in public. After a heart attack in February 1980, he
moved into a house in the northern Tehran suburb of Jamaran where
groups of admirers often sat in a courtyard while he waved at them
silently from a balcony.
   Last month, he underwent surgery for bleeding in his digestive
tract. After the operation doctors pronounced him in good shape for
his age.
   Until the end of the Iran-Iraq war, Khomeini spoke frequently on
the radio. After that his statements were read for him, often by
his politically ambitious son Ahmad.
   He spoke of the need for unity and for becoming more Islamic,
appealing to a deep chord among the Iranian masses. The Khomeini
face _ white beard, dark eyes glaring out from beneath bushy brows
and black turban _ glowered from posters, billboards and banners
across Iran.
   The ascetic ayatollah extolled self-denial and the simple values
of traditional Islamic life. He inveighed against the
Westernization and corruption of the Pahlavi years and demanded
that women return to the old, head-to-foot chador veil.
   He railed against the ``world-devouring'' governments _ the
United States and Soviet Union _ that sought influence over Iran.
   The ayatollah ``is of the opinion that Islam is a religion
embracing all aspects of human life,'' an official Iranian
biography said of him.
   The drive to create a purely Islamic state fired the imagination
of fundamentalists throughout the Moslem world, especially among
Shiites, often an impoverished minority in Moslem nations.
   This worried Iran's Arab neighbors, many ruled by
Western-aligned monarchs or radical secular autocrats and dominated
by the less stern Sunni Moslem sect.
   Fear of ``Khomeinist'' efforts at subversion was one reason
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in September 1980.
   The outside world knew little of Khomeini until the uprising
against the shah in 1978. But for Iranians he had been a symbol of
the anti-Pahlavi movement for decades.
   According to his brother, he was born Sept. 23, 1902, in the
village of Khomein, 140 miles southwest of Tehran. He was the son
of the local religious leader, Ayatollah Sayed Mustafa Musavi.
   The official biography says his mother was the daughter of
another ayatollah, the highest Shiite Moslem religious title,
meaning ``verses of Allah.''
   His father was killed at age 42 by ``some wicked men,'' the
biography says, and from the age of 5 months, Khomeini was reared
by his mother and aunt.
   He received a traditional Moslem seminary education, entirely
restricted to Islamic studies, and in the late 1920s began teaching
in Qom, center of Shiite teaching in Iran, attracting attention for
his independent views.
   According to his brother, at the age of 27, Khomeini married
Khadijeh, the 16-year-old daughter of a clergyman, and had two sons
and three daughters.
   He reportedly took the name Khomeini, from his home village,
after his brother, also an ayatollah, was arrested for politcal
activities in 1930.
   During the 1930s, Khomeini spoke out against the efforts of the
monarch Reza Shah, father of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to reduce the
role of the clergy in everyday Iranian life. In 1941, he published
an essay denouncing the monarch's modernizing policies and foreign
_ at that time British _ domination of Iran.
   Later that year, the World War II Allies occupied Iran and
forced Reza Shah to abdicate in favor of his 21-year-old son.
   Although Khomeini regarded the son with the same distrust as the
father, the anti-communist Khomeini distanced himself from the
leftist-nationalist movement of Mohammad Mossadeq, which briefly
ousted the young shah from power in 1953.
   By 1963, however, when Pahlavi initiated a series of
Westernizing measures, Khomeini had become the most powerful voice
in opposition.
   ``The shah is selling Iran to foreigners. Islam is in peril,''
he claimed in a sermon in Qom that led to rioting in which
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of people were killed by government
forces.
   The outspoken ayatollah was arrested shortly after the rioting
and, according to his supporters, imprisoned in a sweltering cell
where he developed breathing problems. In November 1964, he was
sent into exile, first to Turkey, then to Iraq, where he settled in
the Shiite shrine city of Najaf.
   In exile, the brooding clergyman kept his links with followers
in Iran.
   ``Our one and only remedy is to bring down those corrupt and
corrupting systems of government,'' he wrote.
   Iran, meanwhile, was being transformed by a flood of oil
dollars. The urban population swelled, universities expanded, more
Western ways were introduced. Corruption spread within the Iranian
elite. Dissent was harshly suppressed.
   By 1978, anti-monarchist sentiment was rising quickly,
especially among lower-class city dwellers, frozen out of Iran's
new wealth, and unemployed young graduates, overeducated for jobs
that did not exist.

   It exploded in January 1978, after a Tehran newspaper printed an
anti-Khomeini letter, reportedly instigated by the information
minister, and the ayatollah's supporters took to the streets.
Government forces crushed the demonstrations.
   Khomeini, from his distant sanctuary, emerged as the moral focus
of a burgeoning revolution, and Iran's 150,000 Shiite clergymen and
their network of mosques were the organizational structure.
   The shah, his rule threatened, had Khomeini expelled from
neighboring Iraq. The ayatollah and his close advisers settled in
France in October 1978. His four months there formed his only
experience outside the Middle East.
   From a Paris suburb, Khomeini sent his political message into
Iran through thousands of cassette recordings and the modern
telephone system the shah had installed to link Iran with Europe.
   In Tehran, the cycle of protest and strike built to a bloody
crescendo, and on Jan. 16, 1979, Pahlavi fled the country. On Feb.
1, after more than 14 years in exile, Khomeini returned to his
homeland amid the adulation of millions. The shah's last government
collapsed 10 days later.
   But the revolution was far from finished. Bloodletting far worse
than anything seen in the struggle against the shah loomed as the
revolution, like others before it, began to devour its children.
   In March 1979, Iranians voted overwhelmingly for an ``Islamic
Republic.'' Its constitution made Shiite Islam the state religion,
gave a council of clergymen veto power over legislation, and
enshrined Khomeini as supreme leader for life.
   Leftists, liberals, Western-trained technocrats and others
resisted the clergy's attempts to rule solely by the Koran, the
Islamic holy book. Even some high-ranking clergymen disputed
Khomeini's claims to power. The grand coalition that overthrew the
shah began to fall apart.
   Then, on Nov. 4, 1979, Iranian militants describing themselves
as followers of the ``imam's line'' seized the U.S. Embassy and
hostages in Tehran. The showdown with the United States, which
Khomeini described as a ``war between the Moslems and the pagans,''
heightened tensions between hard-liners and moderates in Iran.
   Within days, the revolution's first prime minister,
Western-educated Mehdi Bazargan, resigned. By the time the 52
hostages were finally released in January 1981, the hard-liners had
won.
   The power struggle climaxed five months later when President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, a layman economist open to compromise with
the outside world, was fired by Khomeini and fled into exile.
   Opposition to the theocracy grew bloodier. The leftist
underground Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, embarked
on an assassination and bombing campaign that killed thousands of
revolutionary officials and security men. The Khomeini regime
responded with mass arrests and executions.
   The confirmed toll of executions reached 6,108 by 1985 _
including former officials of the old regime, dissident
revolutionaries, members of the Bahai religious sect, and sex and
drug offenders.
   But the human rights group Amnesty International said the actual
total must have been considerably higher. The Mujahedeen Khalq
claimed 40,000 people had been executed.
   A new wave of executions killed hundreds and perhaps thousands
in 1988 and 1989 during maneuvering for post-Khomeini power.
   In the war with Iraq, meanwhile, Khomeini for eight years
demanded the ouster and trial of Iraqi President Hussein as a
condition for peace.
   By 1982, Iranian forces had driven the invaders back into Iraq,
and later Iranians conquered some Iraqi territory but at a terrible
cost. U.S. officials estimated at least a half-million Iranians
were killed or wounded in the war.
   The war ended with a cease-fire in August 1988 after a series of
Iraqi victories drove the Iranians from Iraqi territory.
   Khomeini said acceptance of the cease-fire ``is more deadly to
me than poison'' but that it was the will of God and the
recommendation of his political and military advisers.
   Because of the war, revolutionary turmoil and mismanagement,
Iranians endured economic hardship under Khomeini. Food staples and
other essentials were rationed, and possibly one-third of Iran's
workers were jobless.
   The hardship and turmoil was a fertile field for potential
successors to till, particularly after Khomeini dumped his
designated successor, Montazeri. A leading contender was Hashemi
Rafsanjani, the parliament speaker and, since June 1988, acting
commander-in-chief, credited with bringing Iran to the cease-fire.
   But the ayatollah was a deft politician, ``sitting on top of it
all, balancing factions off against each other,'' said one U.S.
official.
   His death sentence against British author Salman Rushdie in
February 1989 for Rushdie's harsh anti-Islamic satire in the novel
``The Satanic Verses'' was seen as a move to counter a moderate
trend among Iranian leaders who wanted to normalize relations with
the West.
   Khomeini continued the effort to institutionalize the Islamic
revolution, naming in April 1989 a 20-man committee to revise the
constitution and ensure a strong leadership system.
   The Iranian leader usually sounded uncompromising, but he could
be thoroughly pragmatic.
   ``According to need, I say one thing today that I contradict
tomorrow,'' Bani-Sadr, a longtime Khomeini protege, once quoted
Khomeini as saying.
   His daughter Zahra, head of the Iranian Women's Association,
said Khomeini was absorbed in the Koran, the Moslem holy book, and
affairs of state from morning until night, even taking the radio to
the bathroom with him.
   ``His self-discipline is unbelievable,'' she said in a talk to
pupils reported by a Tehran paper.

<TEXT>
   Welcome to Texas, where men are men and
women are mayors.
   When Suzie Azar is sworn in June 12 as El Paso mayor, women will
lead Texas' four largest cities. The three largest already have
women mayors: Kathy Whitmire in Houston, Annette Strauss in Dallas
and Lila Cockrell in San Antonio, who took office Thursday,
regaining the post she held from 1975 to 1981.
   They say women's advancement in politics is bringing nearer the
day when voters won't give a candidate's gender a second thought.
   ``I think it's good now that a woman being elected mayor is not
a novelty and that women can do the job and are accepted as such,''
said Ms. Whitmire, who also is president of the Texas Municipal
League and president-elect of the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   In Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, the mayor's job is
considered part-time and much power rests with the full-time city
managers. But the mayors still have a strong role in leading the
city council and lobbying business and political leaders. In El
Paso, the mayor has more power because there is not a city manager.
   Ann Fears Crawford, author of ``Women in Texas,'' a 1982 book
about female politicians, said the idea of female mayors in Texas
is not what's new.
   ``It's not a sudden spate of women,'' she said. ``We've had them
since the '60s, especially in small towns.
   ``What you're just seeing now is them working up to metropolitan
areas.''
   Women are mayors of 12 of the 100 largest cities in the United
States, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at
Rutgers University, and five of those 12 are in Texas. Betty Turner
is mayor of Corpus Christi, the nation's 58th-largest city.
   ``Women have a reputation of caring more about social and
`compassion' issues,'' said Sue Tolleson Rinehart, associate
professor of political science at Texas Tech. ``In local politics,
that's what you tend to be thinking about.''
   But if Texas voters are willing to send women to city hall, they
haven't yet been willing to send them to many higher offices. Of
the 181 seats in the state Legislature, only 19 are held by women.
Treasurer Ann Richards is the only woman in a statewide elected
office, and the state's 29-member congressional delegation is all
male.
   ``It is true that women are making slightly more progress at the
municipal level, but not a lot more,'' said Ms. Whitmire.
   The chairmen of the Texas Democratic and Republican parties said
they believe women are working their way up in state politics.
   ``It's a lot like anything else,'' state GOP Chairman Fred Meyer
said. ``You have to work your way up the ranks.
   ``You don't just run for Congress _ you have to be on the school
board, be on city council, be a mayor, be a state representative.
You have to be something first, because it's not a job for
amateurs.''
   Bob Slagle, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said he
believes there is a relationship between women's rise in business
and politics.
   ``Women are demonstrating they are capable in the corporate and
political worlds,'' Slagle said. ``You get away from a lot of the
myths that women are different from men and can't handle making
decisions and running things.''
   Ms. Whitmire said women are more likely to rise faster in
politics than in business because ``voters tend to be more
open-minded'' than corporate executives.
   The next logical step for women in Texas politics would be to
have a female governor _ the first since Miriam A. ``Ma'' Ferguson
was elected in 1924 as a puppet candidate for her husband,
impeached ex-Gov. James Ferguson.
   Ms. Richards, who gained national attention last year as the
keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention, is expected
to run for governor next year. Ms. Rinehart said the treasurer's
reputation for toughness is deserved.
   ``The Texas political culture has had the reputation of being so
hard on women that the ones who do survive tend to be superwomen,''
she said.

   After Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
return from exile in 1979, thousands would jam the narrow,
mud-walled streets near his Tehran headquarters for a daily
blessing. Usually, they were rewarded with little more than a wave.
   Khomeini's charisma was based neither on fiery rhetoric nor
grandiose gestures. It was his single-minded will that galvanized
Iranian discontent and toppled his U.S.-backed adversary, Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
   In a society that idealizes the bazaar merchant _ a haggler and
a compromiser _ Khomeini, who died Saturday at age 86, did not
haggle or compromise.
   His dour, stony face never displayed the doubts and inner
turmoil that plague many people of power. He rarely smiled during
public appearances; once he allowed a half-grin when one of his
grandsons was brought to him.
   During the turbulent days of the Iranian revolution, Khomeini's
message remained simple: The shah must go. None of the compromises
offered during the chaotic days of January 1979 would satisfy him.
   The shah, pressured by mounting street demonstrations, left the
country on ``vacation'' on Jan. 16, 1979, after appointing
liberal-minded Shahpour Bakhtiar prime minister. Bakhtiar offered
to go to France to escort Khomeini home, but the ayatollah refused.
   When Khomeini returned to Iran on Feb. 1, 1979, the government
issued a conciliatory statement of welcome and acknowledged him as
the nation's spiritual leader.
   Khomeini traveled to a cemetery south of Tehran and announced
immediately that Bakhtiar, too, must go.
   During the speech, the frail Khomeini had to be lifted onto a
makeshift podium to address the tens of thousands gathered there.
   The public address system failed. Except for reporters huddled
beneath the podium, few could hear his words, delivered in a firm
but quiet mumble.
   Still, the crowd roared in support and rushed forward
enthusiastically as Khomeini's helicopter lifted off.
   Within two weeks, the government collapsed and Bakhtiar was in
hiding. Later, he escaped to France.
   Khomeini often seemed oblivious to the challenge of his enemies,
as if they were powerless in the face of Islam.
   Soon after returning, Khomeini assembled the international press
and announced the appointment of his own prime minister, oil
engineer Mehdi Bazargan. Never mind that Bakhtiar still officially
held the post.
   Bazargan was visibly nervous during the news conference.
   Perhaps he was mindful of his role in such a monumental display
of treason. Or perhaps he had discovered what the assembled
reporters already knew _ that his trousers were unzipped.
   But Khomeini sat calmly on Bazargan's right in sublime peace.

   Toxic smoke from a fire in the women's wing
of a prison killed 10 people and injured about 40, officials said
Sunday.
   The blaze at the maximum-security prison began just before
midnight Saturday in a pile of mattresses that investigators said
contained a petroleum resin that produces a toxic, acrid smoke when
burned.
   Police spokesman Piero Sassi said guards and prison firefighters
responded quickly but could not save eight female inmates and two
women guards who died of smoke inhalation in the first minutes of
the blaze.
   Investigators said they believed the fire began accidently, but
authorities appointed a commission of inquiry that began its
investigation Sunday.
   The mattresses were stored on a third-floor porch under the
windows of some of the cells. Investigators said the inmates often
light matches and wave them from their windows to signal male
inmates in another prison section. They said the fire may have
started when a match was dropped from a window.
   Smoke from the fire quickly entered the cells through the
windows left open because it was a warm night, officials said.
   The Italian news agency ANSA said most of the injured were
treated for smoke inhalation and released Sunday but that two women
were in a coma.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners unleashed
artillery barrages across the city Sunday, wounding 14 civilians
and ending a three-week relative lull in the latest round of
Lebanon's civil war.
   Police said five civilians were wounded when shells struck
Moslem west Beirut's Hamra commercial district and the seaside
regions of Raouche and Ein Mreisseh.
   Nine civilians were hospitalized in Christian east Beirut when
Syrian gunners pounded that side of the divided capital, police
said.
   They were the first shelling casualties since May 11, when the
Arab League called a cease-fire to halt nine weeks of fierce
artillery duels. At least 360 people have died and 1,410 have been
wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Gen. Michel Aoun's
mostly Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem
militiamen.
   In Hamra, Sunday strollers ran for cover as a three-shell salvo
crashed near a cluster of sidewalk cafes. Cars sped off, blaring
their horns.
   Along the Moslem coast, sunbathers fled crowded beaches as
radios warned people to stay indoors.
   Aoun's command said its gunners pounded Beirut's Moslem sector
to avenge what it called ``escalated Syrian bombardment of east
Beirut and other population centers'' in the 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   The Syrians shelled the Christian-controlled port and the coast
north of Beirut, a police spokesman said.
   The command of the 40,000 Syrian troops stationed in Lebanon
under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate declined comment on Aoun's charge.
   It was the first time both sides had shelled residential
districts since the Arab League cease-fire was called.
   ``Whether it's just a message to the Arab summit troika or the
beginning of an all-out new shelling round remains to be seen,''
said a police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing rules.
   He referred to a meeting in Rabat, Morocco of the three-member
Arab League committee comprised of King Hassan II of Morocco, King
Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid.
   Arab leaders meeting last month in Casablanca set up the
committee to stabilize the May 11 truce and find a political
settlement to Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   The latest round of fighting broke out after Aoun blockaded
militia-run ports south of Beirut to recover lost taxes estimated
at $100 million annually. Militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Popular Socialist Party responded by shelling Christian
districts. They were joined by Syrian gunners.
   In the southern port of Tyre, a 33-pound explosive went off
Sunday under a black Mercedes parked on a main highway, wrecking
the car but causing no casualties, police said. The explosion
occurred 25 yards from the logistics center of the United Nations
peacekeeping force in south Lebanon.
   Also in Tyre, four civilians were wounded when they were caught
in a cross fire between Palestinian gunmen and Shiite Moslem Amal
militiamen, police said.
   The Amal militiamen were in a yacht off the Rashidiyeh refugee
camp, while the Palestinians were inside their camp.
   Police said they had no information on what triggered the
shootout.

   Floods and landslides caused by
torrential rains killed 171 people and wiped out entire hamlets in
the hills of central Sri Lanka, officials said Sunday.
   More than 100,000 people were homeless after eight inches of
rain drenched central farming regions in the pre-dawn hours of
Sunday, said Mahinda Premawardene, deputy director of the Social
Services Department. The rains had eased by late afternoon Sunday
but continued to hamper search operations.
   The hardest-hit area was the rubber, coconut and tea plantation
region around Kegalle, 45 miles northeast of Colombo. Mud and
stones loosened by a month of steady monsoon rain cascaded down
mountain slopes.
   ``We used our bare hands to dig into tons of mud to find
bodies,'' said local police Sgt. Madumma Banda. ``People from all
walks of life helped the police and troops.''
   He said landslides occurred in at least 10 areas of the Kegalle
district and blocked the main highway from Colombo to the Buddhist
religious center and resort town of Kandy.
   In Bulathkopitiya, 10 miles south of Kegalle, rescue workers
pulled 86 bodies from the landslide that buried the entire
community.
   Other deaths occurred in the neighboring villages of Pinndeniya,
Yatiyantota and Dedigama, Banda said.
   Most rural inhabitants live in shanties made of mud, sticks and
dried palm leaves that aren't made to resist monsoon rains.
   In Ratnapura, Sri Lanka's gem-mining center 45 miles southeast
of Colombo, six people died and flood waters were seven feet deep,
according to police inspector Hector Dharmasiri. Some people
reported flood waters of up to 30 feet deep, he said.
   Two people were crushed by rain-loosened boulders that rolled
down a slope in Nuwara Eliya, a resort town 65 miles east of
Colombo, police said.

   With federal judges seeking a 30 percent pay
raise, The Associated Press conducted a computer-aided analysis of
the incomes and assets of the entire federal judiciary.

<TEXT>
   The majority of America's federal judges have
six-figure investment portfolios and many make more money off the
bench than on, according to a comprehensive study of their
government financial reports.
   The judges, whose current salaries range from $89,500 to
$115,000 a year, are now pressing Congress for a 30 percent salary
increase.
   ``I think judges are entitled to a pay raise,'' said Robert
McWilliams of the U.S. 10th Circuit Court in Colorado. ``They are
worth it. Judges' salaries, rather than being geared to the income
of the average taxpayer, should be geared to the average of
practicing lawyers.''
   An Associated Press survey of 935 financial disclosure reports
found that few federal jurists depend solely on their salaries. All
but 15 of the judges had outside income _ with more than half the
judges reporting extra earnings in a range from $16,624 to $39,500.
   For its study, AP examined reports for 1987, the most recent
year for which a complete set was available. Most material in these
reports is listed within wide numerical ranges rather than in exact
dollar amounts.
   Like other Americans with personal assets, the judges receive
investment income through interest, dividends, rent on real estate,
and capital gains on land or securities. Four hundred judges
reported extra earned income _ some through teaching law, speaking
fees or book royalties, but mostly through pensions from earlier
jobs or settlements from their former law firms.
   ``If I didn't have some farm and timberland that my father left
me, I doubt if I would be so sure that I will spend the rest of my
career on the bench,'' Judge Duross Fitzpatrick said in a letter
used to support the proposal for a 51 percent pay increase that was
defeated by Congress in February.
   According to his disclosure report, Fitzpatrick's outside income
may have exceeded his $89,500 salary. The Macon, Ga., jurist
reported net investment assets between $472,388 and $865,379 and
said he collected between $75,510 and $165,100 in outside income in
1987.
   For 10 years, financial disclosure forms have been required of
federal officials, focusing considerable attention on Congress and
the Cabinet. The judges, in contrast, have received less scrutiny.
   Some details from the judicial disclosures:
   _Only five judges reported no household income other than
salaries.
   _At least 555 judges, perhaps as many as 723, have investment
assets worth more than $100,000 after their debts have been
subtracted. The typical judge reported net investments worth
between $140,000 and $350,000. These assets generally reflect
family funds or substantial incomes before and after appointment to
the bench.
   _At least 62, and as many as 176, of the judges are
millionaires. They include Gerhard Gesell, who presided over the
trial of Oliver North and whose holdings include stock and a
358-acre Virginia farm. Sandra Day O'Connor appears to be the only
millionaire on the Supreme Court.
   _Many of the judges (at least 93 and perhaps as many as 258)
have more money coming in from outside sources than they get from
their government salaries.
   Judicial leaders, right up to Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
say the judges are underpaid, and their salaries indeed lag behind
America's top corporate attorneys. Yet in comparison to most
Americans, or even to most American attorneys, the judges find
themselves in comfortable circumstances.
   The median U.S. wage and salary earner was paid $14,733 in 1987;
at least 507 of the judges made more than that off the bench. A
median means half are above that figure and half are below.
   To look at the point raised by McWilliams, median income for all
of America's 707,000 lawyers and judges was $45,069, according to
Census reports. At least 207 (and as many as 426) of the federal
judges made more than that outside the courtroom.
   The disclosure reports put the median 1987 income for a federal
judge at between $108,018 and $130,300.
   Myron Bright, a semiretired appeals judge in Fargo, N.D.,
receives a $95,000 judicial salary and made more than $43,530 from
teaching and speaking in 1987. His total income was more than the
combined salaries of North Dakota's chief justice and attorney
general.
   Personal finance isn't the lure for many of the attorneys who
accept a lifetime appointment as judge. ``On an actual income
basis, I think I'm making less than I did when I first got on the
bench,'' said the 70-year-old Bright. ``But I'm not complaining.''
   ``Being a federal judge is like getting the brass ring on a
merry-go-round,'' said Avern Cohn of Michigan, a one-time prominent
lawyer who is among the wealthiest judges in the country. ``I was
looking for other ways to prove myself professionally.''
   America's most impoverished judge is Alcee Hastings of Miami,
who is now fighting a perjury impeachment by Congress. Hastings had
legal bills between $450,000 and $1 million in 1987 and reported he
was at least $699,005 in the red.
   More representative of judges who report themselves in debt is
Thomas McAvoy of Binghamton, N.Y., who reported debts that exceed
his assets by $83,797 to $194,500. The bulk of McAvoy's holdings
are in mortgaged real estate.
   Richard Cudahy of Chicago, scion of a Milwaukee meatpacking
family, may be the wealthiest judge. The 63-year-old appellate
jurist is worth between $8.4 million and $16.1 million.
   Overall, the financial reports do not give a complete look at
the judges' wealth because they do not include their homes and
holdings not held for investment purposes. Also, judges can value
property at the purchase price, sometimes decades out of date.
   In addition, the AP understated the wealth by not counting
assets and income of spouses and dependent children except where
specifically noted.
   Earlier this year, Congress balked at a 51 percent raise
proposed for judges, Congress and some executives. Chief Justice
Rehnquist then held a rare news conference to appeal for raises to
avert what he called ``the most serious threat to the future of the
judiciary.'' Rehnquist reports the net value of his investments
between $71,000 and $230,000.
   President Bush responded by proposing 25 percent increases for
the judges with some limits on outside income. The judges are
asking for 30 percent with annual cost-of-living adjustments and no
limits.
   The judges say an inflation-driven financial squeeze will force
many of them from the bench and into higher-paying jobs at law
firms. This assumes they in fact would land the relatively rare
higher paying jobs.
   A survey by The American Lawyer magazine found that 1987 profits
per partner in the 100 firms with the most revenue ranged from
$155,000 to $1.4 million. Their 10,098 partners _ concentrated
primarily in a handful of big cities _ represent 1.5 percent of all
the lawyers in America.

analysis of 935 financial disclosure reports covering 1987, the

   The figures are medians, meaning half the judges are above that
and half are below. The figures are derived independently. For
example, the net value of investments was computed individually for
each judge and then ranked to produce a median.

wide numerical ranges.

<HEAD>With AM-Judicial Finances Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like members of Congress and high-ranking
federal executive officials, federal judges are required to file
annual statements of what they bought, sold, earned, owned or owed
during the year.
   The Associated Press transferred the data for a complete year of
judge's forms, 1987, onto computers for analysis. More than 20,000
pieces of data were included.
   The reporting rules contained in the Ethics in Government Act of
1978 blur the actual value of the investments and income being
disclosed. Most entries are reported within wide numerical ranges
rather than in exact dollar amounts.
   The forms understate assets by exempting some from disclosure,
including:
   _Any home, which is the largest asset for most Americans.
   _Any bank account under $5,000.
   _Any asset under $1,000.
   _Any car or personal property.
   _Any property not held for investment purposes or to produce
income.
   In addition, property can be valued at cost, which is often
decades out of date.
   Liabilities exempt from reporting include home mortgages, debts
to relatives and revolving charge accounts with balances below
$10,000.
   For example, a rental property worth $90,000 and generating
rental income of $10,144 a year would be listed as being worth
``N'' and the income would be ``L.'' N stands for $50,001 to
$100,000 and L is $5,001 to $15,000.
   As the number of items handled this way increases, the overall
precision of the forms decreases.
   It is least precise at the high end of the ranges, which stop at
``over $250,000'' for assets and ``over $100,000'' for income. A
$10 million property would be valued as ``P,'' which simply
signifies more than $250,000. If it brought in income of $1 million
annually, that would be listed as ``H,'' more than $100,000.
   Net worth cannot be calculated from these forms. Instead, the
forms provide data to calculate a net value for an official's
investment portfolio by subtracting reported liabilities from
reported assets.
   The process can be confusing, even to judges _ a handful of whom
attached complaining notes to their forms. In some cases, where the
form was filled out wrong but the intent was clear, minor
interpretation was used by the AP in summarizing a judge's
finances. In cases where more than one interpretation was possible,
the finances were recorded exactly as shown on the form.
   The reports examined by the AP were filed in 1988 and cover the
judges' finances for 1987. That is the most recent complete set.
Reports are required of all judges who work at least 60 days during
a calendar year; between 17 percent and 20 percent of senior judges
do not work that much.
   Some of the judges filing then have since retired, some are
living elsewhere, and a few have died. Other judges have since gone
onto the bench, but their finances are not part of this study
because they were not required to file for that year.

<HEAD>DEA: Security Tight Despite Arrest of Agents</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They call it ``crossing the line'' or ``going
south,'' and it's the most agonizing task the Drug Enforcement
Administration faces _ investigating agents who succumb to the lure
of drug money.
   Since March, three agents from the Miami office, the DEA's
largest with 350 agents, have been charged with protecting the drug
traffickers they were supposed to be throwing in jail.
   They join three others convicted here since the early 1980s of
aiding or supplying information to drug smugglers in return for
hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   But that doesn't mean the Medellin Cartel has somehow penetrated
the DEA's top-secret operations, says John Fernandes, a DEA
spokesman here.
   ``I don't know of any agents who were killed or any major
investigations compromised by these cases,'' he said. ``These were
all isolated incidents.''
   Most DEA officials are reluctant to talk about cleaning their
own house _ the DEA's Washington headquarters failed to respond to
repeated requests by The Associated Press for the number of agents
arrested nationally on charges of drug involvement.
   But Tom Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami office,
confronts the issue head-on.
   ``This is elephant-land for cocaine,'' he said. ``Last year we
seized $178 million in cash and property, and 40 percent of that
was green.''
   Cash pulled a photo from his office wall of agents posing with a
$1.9 million cash haul, and pointed to individually wrapped packets
of $100 bills.
   ``Each one of those is $10,000,'' Cash says. ``The agent thinks,
`Suppose I put two or three of these in my pocket _ who's going to
know the difference?'''
   A spokesman for the federal Office of National Drug Control
Policy in Washington says corruption in the DEA, while considered
low-level, is a cause for concern.
   ``It's a problem we're aware of and will be looking into,'' said
Larry Cirignano, spokesman for director William J. Bennett. ``The
problem is money. At some point, everybody comes to a price, even
though you hope they don't.''
   Because of the huge amounts of cash agents deal with, and the
necessity of working undercover with informants who themselves
actively engage in trafficking, the DEA is the nation's most
tempted law-enforcement agency, Cash said.
   In response, the DEA has an unforgiving policy to combat the
line-crossers, and those who allow confidential information to ``go
south'' to traffickers, as the agents say.
   ``We don't sweep these cases under the rug,'' Cash said. ``And
we do not just fire people for violations of law _ we prosecute
them.''
   In addition, the DEA has a tight system to finger an agent who
wanders from standard procedures.
   Agents generally work in groups of about a dozen, and anyone who
displays too much interest in a case outside his jurisdiction
immediately comes under scrutiny.
   The DEA keeps track of every request for its computerized files,
and can later cross-check for suspicious activity if it appears
traffickers know too much. There are about 2 million files in the
national computer system. In Miami, the agency is currently
investigating 3,000 cases and using about 500 informants.
   When operating in the field, confiscated cash and drugs must be
counted by at least two agents. Whenever possible, agents avoid
counting cash at all and just bundle it up and send it to a bank.
Because of the slippery nature of dealings with informants, no
agent is supposed to meet an informant alone.
   All agents _ including Cash himself _ must take a monthly drug
test. Failure means immediate dismissal.
   And every complaint against an agent, no matter what its source
or how dubious, is investigated, Cash said.
   ``No check would ever be so thorough as when it involves a DEA
agent,'' Cash says. ``We would spend our whole budget on it, if
necessary.''
   Cash has developed a surprising theory on which agents are most
likely to cross the line.
   ``It's not the average special agent who is involved in these
types of incidents _ it's the very best. Most of them were
problem-free,'' he said. ``They're the ones who are working
undercover, running up against the very best on the other side.''
   After a while, they believe they know the system and can beat
it, he said.
   The recent Miami cases bear him out. All involved agents had at
least nine years of experience in the agency.
   Jorge Villar, who worked with Metro-Dade police before joining
DEA 11 years ago, was arrested in March for allegedly agreeing to
accept $300,000 to protect a cocaine shipment from the Bahamas.
   Arrested together last month were agents Drew Bunnell and Al
Iglesias, who were accused of wanting $100,000 from an informant to

   This birthplace and gravesite of Smokey
Bear has become a shrine to fire prevention, and residents admit
their town would be just a dot on the map without the singed cub
that grew into a worldwide symbol.
   The symbol is more important than ever with fire danger in
nearby forests at an all-time high, said Steve Makowski, fire
management officer for the Smokey Bear Ranger District of the
Lincoln National Forest.
   ``We are in the worst conditions ever seen here,'' said Makowski
_ even worse than 1950, when a 17,000-acre fire left the tiny,
terrified, motherless bear cub clinging to the trunk of a
smoldering tree in the Capitan Gap northeast of town.
   After firefighters cleaned up the cub and veterinarians treated
his fire-blistered paws and singed tail, they named him Smokey and
started him on a new life that included 26 years in the National
Zoo in Washington, D.C. He became the embodiment of the symbol
created in 1944 by the U.S. Forest Service to encourage fire
prevention.
   When the 400-pound bear died in 1976 at the age of 26 _ that's
10 years longer than the average bear lives _ the body was brought
back to Capitan for burial.
   This town of 1,200 is built around Smokey. There's the Smokey
Bear Motel, the Smokey Bear Restaurant, the Smokey Bear Museum run
by the village, and Smokey Bear State Park. The Smokey Bear
Stampede will be held July 1-4.
   Last year, 42,000 people visited Capitan and the small log-cabin
museum the townspeople built themselves with donated funds. Inside
are Smokey hats, puzzles, bookmarks, bells, T-shirts and other
memorabilia. The walls are lined with pictures of the little cub
and the grown-up bear.
   The museum and state park share a four-acre plot that includes
trails, native plants, a playground and a tennis court. And, of
course, Smokey's grave _ beneath an imposing boulder capped with a
bronze marker.
   A few years back, a team of 48 Indian firefighters from Utah and
Arizona stopped here after battling a blaze in southern New Mexico.
   ``They said they never thought they'd get to see Smokey's
grave,'' said Willie Hobbs, curator of the village museum. ``They
stood in line. They were so happy to get to the place where Smokey
the Bear was found.''
   Visitors come from all over the world, said Chamber of Commerce
president Dick Beck. ``It's one of the few things we've got here as
far as tourism,'' he added.
   But Makowski says Smokey retains a much more serious meaning.
   Fire departments from around the world write to the Smokey Bear
Fire Prevention District seeking advice on setting up Smokey Bear
programs and at least 20 countries now have such programs, he said.
   ``I think Smokey's been an extremely effective program,''
Makowski said.
   Back at the National Zoo in Washington, Smokey Junior lives on.
He's an ``adopted'' son of the original Smokey, who had no
offspring, according to zoo spokesman Dan Gifford.

   The secretary of the Calhoun County
Historical Society did a double take as he entered City Hall on his
way to a meeting. There, among 100 years worth of portraits of
Anniston mayors, was a face he'd seen before.
   It took Robert Lindley and city officials a while to sort out
why a picture of the Rev. Charles W. Freeland, rector of the Church
of St. Michael and All Saints, was hanging there. The rector was
identified as T.H. Hopkins, mayor from 1881-85.
   Lindley said he recognized Freeland while at city hall earlier
this year from pictures hanging at the Episcopal church.
   Freeland ``kind of has that look of someone who would be in
charge or important,'' Lindley said explaining how the mistake
could happen.
   When Lindley notified city officials, they noticed the man in
the picture has a cross on a chain around his neck. ``And if you
look real close, you can see the clerical collar,'' he said.
   Jim Johnson, of Lance Johnson Studios, who painted the former
mayors' portraits from old photographs, said a mislabled, old print
of Freeland's picture must have gotten mixed up with those of the
mayors.
   Years ago, Johnson's father bought Russell Bros., Anniston's
first portrait photographers, he said, and that apparently was the
source of Freeland's picture.
   Freeland's portrait was removed last week from pictorial
association with the mayors, and the congregation of St. Michael's
is interested in getting it back, Abby Ulrey, church office
administrator, said.
   Meanwhile, Johnson is attempting to locate a print of Hopkins
for a new portrait to fill the empty wall space.
   But city employees will miss the familiar face of Freeland,
a.k.a. Hopkins, personnel clerk Marguerite Bright said.
   ``He looked like someone you'd want for an ancestor,'' she said.

   Depending on how you look at it, it took
Dorothy Terry either 57 years or 12 days to earn her high school
diploma.
   Mrs. Terry, who left school at the age of 13 and will turn 70
next month, needed only six weeks of study _ two days a week _ to
get her General Educational Development diploma.
   ``I don't know why I let so many years go by,'' the Covington
resident told her fellow graduates during a ceremony last week.
``We all have the same reasons, more or less: busy, no time.
   ``Suddenly I felt a thirst for knowledge. The opportunity was
all around me, and all I had to do was go for it.''
   In 1932, Mrs. Terry dropped out of school in New Orleans to
learn how to sew. Four years later she was married, and dreams
about resuming her education were forgotten.
   ``We never had the things they have now: washers, dryers,
dishwashers,'' she said. ``When I got married that was the end of
my life. Once you get married your life is over. You can't go to
school any anymore. I had to raise four children.''
   Now a great-grandmother, she works at a day-care center. And she
plans to stay in school, studying music and computer science at
Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond.
   ``It keeps you from getting older. As long as you use this,''
she said, tapping her forehead, ``you keep it moving. You find when
you read and do math ... it keeps you younger.''

   A man who says he holds the world
record for rides on a single roller coaster has taken his 8,000th
trip on the Racer at the Kings Island amusement park.
   Don Helbig, 26, of Cincinnati threw his hands high as he went up
and down on the ride. ``The thrill keeps getting better, and I
don't plan to stop until I hit 10,000,'' he said Friday.
   Helbig, who manages a sporting goods store in suburban
Cincinnati, said he hopes to reach his goal in 1990.
   He took his 7,000th ride on the Racer in August 1987. Kings
Island officials say an organization called the American Coaster
Enthusiasts has verified that Helbig's ride total on the Racer is a
record for riding one attraction.
   He began riding on the roller coaster in 1981 while he was
seasonally employed by the Cincinnati Reds. He stepped up his ride
pace during a strike by major-league baseball players that year
which gave him more free time.
   In 1982, one train of the Racer was turned around to operate in
the backward direction. Helbig says he has ridden the coaster 4,800
times in the forward direction and 3,200 times backward. He took
his 8,000th ride facing forward.

   Here is a list of the 935 federal judges whose
financial disclosure statements were examined by The Associated
Press.
   The list gives each judge's court and arange that approximates
the dollar amount of the net value of his investments.
   It should be noted that some of the judges appear to be in debt
when that may not be true. This is because the government reporting
system understates assets and can overstate liabilities.
   The figures on this list were computed by subtracting the range
for a judge's debts from the range for his investments. This
occasionally produces a transposed range for disclosed net
investment portfolio because the ranges for debts and assets may be
in varying sizes.
   In some cases, where the judge's form was filled out incorrectly
but the intent was clear, minor interpretation was used by the AP
in summarizing a judge's finances. In other cases, where more than
one interpretation was possible, finances were recorded exactly as
they were on the form.

<HEAD>Tight Budget Slows Projects of Agency Involved In Star Wars Project</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A small but innovative agency within the
Pentagon's Star Wars missile defense effort faces a second year of
reduced funding, forcing a slowdown in research projects ranging
from optical computers to high-power microwave weapons.
   The agency, the Office of Innovative Science and Technology,
served as a lightning rod for criticism of the Strategic Defense
Initiative shortly after it was launched several years ago. IST's
activities continue to draw both criticism and qualified support
within the American civilian scientific community.
   IST funding peaked at $106 million in fiscal 1988 but was cut to
$76 million this fiscal year. Tentative plans call for a slight
increase, to $80 million, in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   If that plan holds, IST Director Dwight Duston said, ``we'll
probably have to make some severe decisions. It's going to
certainly dampen the program.''
   ``We have some things which are ready to really accelerate now.
In other words, we've got some seed corn sprouting and it's ready
to go. If we have to be held at $80 million, there'll be no
fertilizer this coming year. Things will have to percolate along at
the very fiscally limited level they are now,'' he said.
   Duston said he was told his agency's spending was being
virtually frozen because of competing priorities and overall fiscal
constraints.
   For the entire SDI program, the Bush administration has
requested $4.6 billion in fiscal 1990, up from $4.1 billion this
fiscal year but considerably below the $5.9 billion recommended by
President Reagan before he left office.
   Critics of IST contend it has taken a highly idiosyncratic
approach to funding research projects, without adequate scientific
peer review, that it has sought to polish SDI's image by getting
university researchers involved with the program and that it has
oversold the potential for civilian spinoffs from SDI research.
   ``You can't spend that amount of money without coming up with
some little odds and ends,'' said John Pike, associate director for
space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a
Washington-based public interest group. ``But I sure haven't seen
anything that's going to rescue the American electronics industry.''
   Rosy Nimroody, a national security analyst with the Council on
Economic Priorities, a New York-based organization that has issued
several reports critical of Star Wars, said the IST program ``was
definitely oversold.''
   She said in recent years officials running the program have
become more restrained in using IST for SDI image-building. But she
added: ``I think there still remains an effort to get as many
people as possible, so they can go around and say we have X number
of universities involved in SDI.''
   IST supporters, however, argue the program has been successful
in promoting innovative projects which compare well with the
scientific output of other Pentagon-sponsored laboratories.
   ``My own assessment is that within SDI, I think that a program
like (IST) is very important and is in many ways the
highest-quality and most promising part of the entire program,''
said Ashton Carter, acting director of the Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard. ``They've done well at attracting
proposals that are reasonably good and that will have some
application even if we never build a missile defense system.''
   Duston said about 50 percent of IST's research money goes to
academic institutions, 30 percent to private companies and 20
percent to government laboratories. The program has contracts with
researchers at 95 U.S. universities.
   IST projects which he said appear promising but are likely to be
slowed because of reduced funding include:
   _Optical computers, whose central processors operate very fast
because they utilize pulses of light rather than electricity.
   IST, in conjunction with other agencies including the Office of
Naval Research and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, had planned to mount an ``aggressive program'' to
construct a first-generation, all-purpose optical computer within
the next two years. ``We'll just have to stretch it,'' Duston said.
   _Advanced diamond technology, opening up new fields of diamond
optics, highly heat-resistant electronic components and other
future applications such as superhard coatings on surgical
instruments. IST-funded researchers had been making progress in
growing thin diamond layers on non-diamond materials.
   _High-power microwaves for disabling the electronics of enemy
missiles, aircraft and other weapon systems. Duston said IST likely
would delay plans for field tests of a high-power microwave device
because of the tight budget.

   Hundreds of thousands of people returned to the
streets Sunday to block army troops who cut a bloody swath through
the city the night before, killing hundreds and clearing Tiananman
Square of pro-democracy protesters.
   Troops fired at citizens in at least one incident late Sunday,
and protesters were reported blocking streets in Shanghai, China's
largest city. There were no troops there, according to Shanghai
radio.
   The slaughter that left at least 500 dead, perhaps thousands,
drew worldwide condemnation but failed to completely quell the
7-week-old student-led campaign.
   Chinese sources said senior leader Deng Xiaoping ordered the
bloody invasion from a hospital where he is seriously ill with
prostate cancer. `Even if they're functioning out of ignorance,
they are still participating and must be suppressed,'' Deng, 84,
was quoted as saying of the protesters.
   The sources were from the office of Li Xiannian, the former
president and now the head of an important advisory body. Officials
never have confirmed Deng is seriously ill.
   Tens of thousands of troops were stationed around the 100-acre
Tiananmen Square. As many as 200,000 more were believed camped in
the outskirts of the city.
   Other areas of the capital were dominated by hundreds of
thousands of angry citizens who bolstered barricades to restrict
troop movements.
   Chinese students marched tearfully in Taipei, Paris, London, San
Francisco, New York, Los Angeles, Oslo and Vancouver. In Hong Kong,
which will revert to Chinese rule in 1997, about 200,000 people
rallied to mourn the Beijing slaughter.
   The military entered the city to enforce martial law, declared
May 20 but not enforced then because of a government power struggle
caused by the protest movement. The struggle pitted hardliners such
as Deng and Premier Li Peng against moderates such as Communist
Party leader Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly lost his post.
   Soldiers began shooting, beating and running over Beijing
residents late Saturday as they finally started their deadly push
to Tiananman Square, where students were in the third week of a
sit-in. Flames from burning military vehicles seized by protesters
lit up the sky, and bodies were scattered in the streets.
   On Sunday evening, about 100 troops charged into a residential
area just north of the square, shooting into narrow alleyways as
women clutched their babies and people fell to the pavement. After
the attack, residents came out again and taunted the soldiers with
cries of ``fascist!''
   Thousands of people returned to the Xidan intersection about a
mile west of the square to re-erect barriers and set fire to
military vehicles and buses.
   People blocked some roads with large trucks, others with simple
food stalls.
   ``Before this happened we loved the party,'' said one
40-year-old worker. ``Now we oppose the party. We deeply oppose the
party.''
   The worker was one of thousands walking through the Fuxing
Hospital in western Beijing, where 21 bodies were laid haphazardly
on the floor.
   About 200 yards west of the hospital, at the Muxidi
intersection, was a large abandoned convoy of military vehicles
that had been torched. Flames still shot out of some of the 70
trucks, vans, and armored personnel carriers.
   Muxidi was the scene of a pitched battle Saturday night, with
troops bombarding citizens with tear gas and gunfire before
blasting through their barricades.
   ``It was horrible. They killed old folks and small children,''
said one weeping old man.
   Except for the area around Tiananmen, the city was generally
free of troops, although there were reports the army planned to
move into the university campus area in the northwest.
   Troops shot indiscrimately during the march to Tiananman.
Citizens responded by hurling rocks. No casualty toll was
available, but a doctor said 500 people died and others said the
death toll may be in the thousands. Several thousand were hurt.
   One doctor said he was aware of a young man who was strangled by
troops with chains.
   Official government announcements on the army attack, aired
repeatedly on national television, said the troops ``suppressed a
counterrevolutionary riot'' and achieved a ``great victory in the
struggle to end turmoil in the capital.''
   The Beijing municipal government said soldiers and police
``strictly observed discipline'' and said ``their heroic acts and
glorious exploits have won fervent praise and strong support from
the masses of students and citizens.''
   The reports said three soldiers were killed and more than 1,000
injured by ``thugs,'' but did not mention casualties among the
populace.
   An announcer for the English-language Radio Beijing, monitored
in Washington, said thousands of people, mostly civilians, were
killed. The station later switched announcers and returned to
reading government pronouncements.
   The evening news showed a tank knocking down the ``Goddess of
Democracy,'' a 33-foot-high replica of the Statue of Liberty that
was put up by students.
   The student-led protests began April 15, with students calling
for talks with the government on bringing greater social freedoms
and ending official corruption. Regular citizens joined the
protests, and at times 1 million people poured through the streets.
   On March 13, students began a round-the-clock occupation of
Tiananman. Martial law was declared seven days later, but efforts
by troops to move against the students were thwarted peacefully by
huge throngs who massed around convoys, urging soldiers not to
fight them.
   Two staffers of the American television network CBS,
correspondent Richard Roth and cameraman Derek Williams, were
released Sunday night after being detained in Tiananmen, the
network's office said.
   A reporter for the French magazine Paris Match was slightly
wounded when a ricocheted bullet hit him and a Japanese
photographer was shot in the foot. Two Reuters correspondents were
detained. One was blindfolded, roughed up and held for six hours.

   Throngs of cheerful Poles crowed into
polling stations around the country on Sunday to elect lawmakers in
Eastern Europe's freest balloting in more than 40 years.
   Among the first to vote were Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa, in
his home city of Gdansk, and Communist Party leader Gen. Wojciech
Jaruzelski, near his house in southern Warsaw.
   The elections for a new Senate and the Sejm, the existing
one-chamber parliament, were the first in Poland with opposition
candidates since 1947, when the vote was widely denounced as
fraudulent and the communists seized power.
   Opposition representatives are on the commissions that conducted
Sunday's elections, and Solidarity signed up more than 100,000 poll
watchers to ensure an honest count.
   ``People are not acting like sheep and just dropping in their
ballots,'' Malgorzata Ufnal said as she voted in Warsaw. ``They sit
down and think about the candidates.''
   Polls opened at 6 a.m. and government officials estimated that
80 percent of the country's 27.2 million eligible voters would cast
ballots before they closed at 10 p.m.
   Each voter was required to cross out dozens of names on up to
seven paper ballots, and the count was not expected to be complete
until Wednesday or Thursay, according to election officials.
   Walesa was cheered by 50 people who crowded polling station No.
169 in the Baltic port city of Gdansk as he voted for only the
second time in his life after years of boycotting.
   ``Poland has started on the road of progress, and you have to
help her,'' he told onlookers.
   Jaruzelski was accompanied by his wife, Barbara, and joked that
he marked his ballot more quickly than she did.
   Voters chose 100 people for a new Senate, the only freely
elected legislative chamber in the East bloc. It will have veto
power over legislation passed by the 460-seat Sejm.
   Opposition candidates were permitted to run for 161, or 35
percent, of the Sejm seats, under an agreement on political and
economic reforms reached in April between the government and the
Solidarity-led opposition.
   The agreement also legalized the trade union, which had been
banned for seven years after a martial law crackdown in December
1981.
   Solidarity voiced confidence before the elections. But the
government appeared nervous that some of its best-known figures,
running unopposed for the Sejm on the so-called ``national list,''
might nonetheless receive less than 50 percent of the vote.
   Without half the vote, national list candidates would be
defeated and the Sejm seats would not be filled. A runoff is set
for June 18 for all other races in which no candidate receives 50
percent of the vote.
   Walesa said he would be satisfied if Solidarity won 25 percent
of the Sejm seats and 75 percent of the Senate.
   Many voters treated the election as a referendum on the party's
45 years of rule. Both sides agree that political changes will not
quickly or dramatically improve the economy, burdened by a $39
billion foreign debt, shortages, inefficiency and 80 percent
inflation.
   The historic day broke damp and gray but turned sunny in the
afternoon. Large crowds appeared at polling stations after people
in the heavily Roman Catholic country emerged from Mass.
   There were more than 22,400 polling stations nationwide.
Solidarity members set up tables outside many stations and gave out
names of the movement's candidates, technical information on how to
vote and even lollipops in Solidarity wrappers.
   ``If after 40 years one has a chance to choose, one should take
the chance,'' said Mrs. Ufnal's husband, Andrzej.
   ``Everybody at my workplace thinks that if Solidarity enters the
Sejm something will change and they will be able to join in'' the
governing process, said the young father.
   ``It feels totally different,'' one older woman said after
voting. ``Now there is a freedom of choice.''
   Many people said they voted after years of boycotting in which
the only candidates were those approved by the Communist Party.
   Walesa urged all eligible to vote, calling the election ``a
chance now to make this the country of our dreams.''
   Communist authorities proposed the talks that led to the
political and economic reforms after a wave of severe strikes in
August 1988.

<HEAD>`Summary Trial' Starts in Uranium Plant Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unusual non-binding trial begins Monday
with selection of jurors to hearing a $300 million lawsuit brought
by neighbors of a government plant that processed uranium for
nuclear weapons.
   The ``summary trial,'' a rare form of court proceeding, is an
effort to encourage a settlement in the class action suit
representing about 14,000 people who live near the Feed Materials
Production Center in Fernald and National Lead of Ohio Inc., which
operated the plant for the federal government from 1951 to 1985.
   The plaintiffs allege the 38-year-old plant, 18 miles northwest
of Cincinnati, has polluted their soil, air and water with
radioactive materials as well as asbestos, chlorides and barium,
damaging their health, lowering the value of their property and
causing them emotional stress.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel set aside more than a week
for the summary trial.
   The plant's owner, the U.S. Department of Energy, denies charges
made in the suit but has begun a cleanup program at the plant site.
The department admits that over the years, more than 300,000 pounds
of radioactive uranium oxide got past the plant's air-filtering
systems and into the air.
   Both sides have prepared for the mock trial as if it were
binding, knowing that a jury finding against their side would
create pressure on them to settle. The plaintiffs' lawyer, Stanley
M. Chesley, said he wants to negotiate a settlement in the case but
the Energy Department is unwilling and he hopes the trial will
encourage a settlement.
   ``We're finally going to hear the story of Fernald. We're
finally going to have it in a court of law,'' Chesley said. ``We
think it's a wonderful opportunity to resolve a dispute.''
   Energy Department lawyer Henry A. Gill Jr. declined to say if
the department would be willing to settle the case. He said no
settlement talks are under way.
   The Energy Department contends that National Lead was a
contractor following government orders and is innocent. The
department has conceded that the government told NLO to put
priority on production, even if it meant ignoring environmental
regulations. It says that is no longer the case with the current
operator, Westinghouse Materials Co.
   Spiegel has previously used the summary trial, a method some
lawyers and judges dislike, to coax a settlement in a complex case
that might otherwise take up weeks of court time.
   Gill said he would not regard the jury's verdict as a final
statement.
   ``Absolutely not. It's, by its very nature, a non-binding
verdict. It's a settlement tool that some judges like to avoid
using,'' Gill said.
   He declined comment when asked if he thought a summary trial was
a good idea in the present case.
   Chesley said he will tell the jury that the plant's neighbors
want the government to pay money that they can get regular medical
monitoring _ including cancer detection tests.
   The courts offer a faster and better way for the residents to
get relief than waiting for Washington to clean up the plant, he
said.
   ``It's always been my view that the court system is the great
equalizer. I'm not taking anything away from Congress,'' Chesley
said. ``But the courts do cause litigation and disputes to be
resolved. ... The only place you can get true compensation for
victims is in the courthouse.''
   The judge ordered officials of the Energy Department and
National Lead to attend the trial.

   A gas pipeline running alongside the
Trans-Siberian Railroad exploded as two packed passenger trains
passed Sunday, incinerating rail cars in a ``tornado of fire,''
killing many people and leaving 800 missing, Tass said.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and other officials rushed to the
scene of the accident, which the official Soviet news agency
described as ``a huge catastrophe'' and a ``terrible tragedy.'' It
was the third serious train accident in the Soviet Union in a year.
   The pipeline containing liquefied petroleum gas exploded at 1:14
a.m. as the trains passed each other on opposite tracks between the
towns of Ufa and Asha, 745 miles southeast of Moscow, Tass said.
The agency said gas seeped from the conduit and caught fire but it
was not clear what caused the leakage.
   The agency said the trains were carrying 1,200 people and only
400 were accounted for. Some of the rail cars were incinerated, the
agency said.
   ``Military units are searching the adjacent forest and mountains
in the hope that some of the passengers managed to escape from the
tornado of fire,'' Tass said.
   Ufa Mayor Mikhail A. Zaitsev said many injured were transported
to his city, 62 miles west of the remote accident site in the Ural
Mountains.
   ``Helicopters are constantly arriving with more injured,'' he
said in a telephone interview.``It's terrible. It's monstrous. The
people are very shocked and are suffering about what happened,'' he
said, his voice shaking.
   Tass said there were ``numerous victims'' but neither the agency
nor Zaitsev gave a death toll.
   Gorbachev's decision to fly to the scene indicated the death
toll was high.
   Also going to the scene were Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov,
Russian federation Premier Alexander V. Vlasov, Defense Minister
Dmitri T. Yazov and Health Minister Yevgeny I. Chazov.
   The emergency trip by Gorbachev recalled his decision in
December to cut short a New York visit so he could rush to Soviet
Armenia, where some 25,000 people were killed in an earthquake.
   The Trans-Siberian Railroad links the western, European part of
the country to the Asian region in the east. The passenger trains
involved were traveling between Novosibirsk, the largest town in
Siberia with a population of 1.3 million, and Adler, a popular
health resort.
   Doctors, soldiers and police rushed to the remote site, where a
field hospital was set up to help the victims and relatives of the
dead, Tass said.
   ``A mass campaign to collect blood has been launched in the
towns of the region even though it is Sunday, and blood is also
being delivered to the Ural Mountains by helicopters,'' the news
agency reported.
   Traffic on the damaged section of the railroad was halted while
the track was repaired, Tass said.
   The Communist Party and government leadership in Moscow sent its
``deep condolences'' to the families of the victims, Tass reported.
A nationwide day of mourning was declared, and Moscow legislator
Boris N. Yeltsin told thousands of supporters at a political rally
in the capital about the accident.
   ``We've never before had such a high casualty toll on the
railroads,'' he said, without giving figures. ``A lot of children
died because they were returning home from the South, where they
had been on vacation. There were a lot of mothers with children,
whole families,'' Yeltsin said.
   The people at the boisterous rally in a stadium parking lot
suddenly fell silent when Yeltsin proposed a minute of silence to
mourn the victims.
   On June 4, 1988, nearly 100 people died in an explosion of three
freight trains in Arzamas, a city in the Volga River Valley 240
miles east of Moscow. The trains were loaded with industrial
explosives.
   In the most recent serious train accident in the Soviet Union,
two freight trains, one laden with propane, collided May 20 in the
capital of Soviet Kazakhstan. An ensuing explosion and fire killed
five people, and destroyed factories and 13 house.
   Since the Arzamas accident, the Soviet press has published a
number of articles complaining about lax railway safety.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping gave the orders for
the military assault on central Beijing from a hospital where he is
being treated for prostate cancer, official sources said Sunday.
   The sources said Deng's condition is serious. He has long been
rumored to have prostate problems, and there have been unconfirmed
reports he has cancer.
   The officials, in the office of former President Li Xiannian,
said Deng gave the orders Saturday for troops to crush the protest
in Tiananmen Square. The military assault killed hundreds of
people. Li is now the head of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference, an important advisory body.
   ``Even if they're functioning out of ignorance they are still
participating and must be suppressed,'' Deng was quoted as saying.
``In China, even 1 million people can be considered a small sum.''
   Up to 1 million people streamed into Beijing streets in recent
weeks to support the students' democracy movements.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Deng was
angry, saying he had not been properly informed about the student
movement.
   Deng, 84, heads the Central Military Commission, his only public
post after resigning from most of his official offices in 1987.
Deng, China's most influential advocate for economic reform, has
opposed rapid political change.
   Deng reportedly forced the resignation of Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang because of his conciliatory reaction
to the student protesters. But there has been no official word on
Zhao, whose resignation would have to be accepted by the Communist
Party's Central Committee.

   Ten years ago, Yan Ke fled the Khmer
Rouge killing fields, evaded an advancing Vietnamese army and was
put in fetid refugee camps. He said he never expected to see his
homeland or family again.
   With a little nephew in tow, the refugee ended his odyssey in
the United States _ haunted by the past and concerned about
survival in a strange land.
   But Yan Ke did well and recently was able to join an increasing
number of his countrymen cautiously returning for visits from the
United States, France, Australia and Canada. Rather than crossing
border minefields, this time he traveled on airliners from
Columbus, Ohio, to Phnom Penh.
   His aging parents and nearly 40 family members were waiting for
him.
   ``When I stepped off the plane and they were all there, I could
say nothing,'' Yan Ke said. ``And I nearly cried when I saw my
ruined country. They need everything.''
   Three generations posed for his video camera within the former
Royal Palace compound _ a haven of peace before the Cambodian war,
Khmer Rouge terror, Vietnamese invasion and civil strife.
   Yan Ke said he was a high school student in the northwestern
province of Battambang when Khmer Rouge guerrillas routed the
U.S.-backed government in 1975.
   Like many strong tee-agers, he was separated from his parents
and said he was assigned to a work brigade. Reward for labor in the
fields amounted to several spoonfuls of rice mixed with water and
vegetable scraps.
   An uncle, a cousin and several other relatives were among the
hundreds of thousands killed by the Khmer Rouge, Yan Ke said.
   At night he would listen to victims being taken away to the
killing fields and hear the thud of blunt instruments against human
flesh. Yan Ke said he still has nightmares about one boy from his
brigade who kept a shoulder bag he had found in the forest. This
``criminal'' was brought before the workers; then his throat was
cut and his stomach slit open.
   In 1979, with Vietnamese troops invading, Yan Ke said his family
held a futive family reunion. It was decided that he and a
3-year-old nephew, Voeun Ke, would try to make it to the Thai
frontier. Another brother and two sisters would remain to care for
the parents.
   He and his nephew reached the border after three days of
walking, Yan Ke said, but robbers took the bits of gold he had
concealed in a pack of cigarettes.
   For more than a year, Yan Ke and his nephew lived in swelling
refugee camps in Thailand and the Philippines. Then, with the help
of a Roman Catholic charity, they arrived in the United States and
in 1981 settled in Columbus, where 2,500 other Cambodians have
found homes.
   Yan Ke said he worked as a machine operator in a steel mill,
then got a job with the state employment office. He also earned a
bachelor's degree in computer science and developed a home repair
business.
   Still single, he and his nephew live in one of four apartments
that he owns. ``It was tough being a father without any experience,
but I've learned,'' Yan Ke said. His nephew prefers hamburgers to
rice and is forgetting the Cambodian language.
   Like many Cambodians and other Indochinese refugees, Yan Ke sent
thousands of dollars to his relatives. Recently he decided to see
them again.
   ``Some of my Cambodian friends said I was crazy, and the U.S.
State Department warned that they could not help me if I got into
trouble,'' Yan Ke said.
   But he also knew Cambodians had been returning over the past 18
months, and the government, hoping to attact tourism and
investment, had encouraged them. Despite recent liberalization and
prospects of a settlement of the Cambodian conflict, a communist
party is still in control within and Khmer Rouge guerrillas are
still mobilized.
   ``Many still don't trust the situation,'' he said. ``But I'd
like overseas Cambodians to become more involved in helping the
people here. Especially the children.''
   Yan Ke visited schools without books and clinics with few
supplies. He plans to raise money in Ohio to help a clinic.
   ``It's enough suffering. We need a break,'' Yan Ke said one
night in Phnom Penh. ``Look at those who were born in in the Khmer
Rouge era and weren't as lucky as my nephew. They have only seen
the dark side of life.''

<HEAD>House To Install New Speaker, Then Turn To S&amp;L Bailout Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN KOMAROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House is expected to install new speaker
this week and then turn to one of the biggest pieces of legislation
of the year, a bailout of the troubled savings and loan industry.
   The Senate hopes to finish work on its version of a bill that
started off as mostly an emergency increase in veterans spending,
but which has become a menagerie of lawmakers' pet priorities.
   House Speaker Jim Wright, beset by ethics charges, announced
last week he would relinquish his gavel upon the selection of a
successor.
   Democrats on Tuesday plan to caucus and nominate Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., currently the majority leader, for that job. The
full House will ratify the nomination later in the day.
   The House will then take up President Bush's proposal for joint
development of a fighter jet with Japan.
   A Senate vote last month already made it clear the project known
as the FSX will go forward, but House opponents want a chance to
vote on what they say amounts to the United States giving away
technology that made America the world's leading aircraft
manufacturer.
   Prime Minister Bhutto of Pakistan is scheduled to address a
joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday.
   The House is scheduled to begin debate later Wednesday on its
version of Bush's plan to revamp and keep solvent the savings and
loan industry.
   The massive legislation rejects the president's notion that its
$50 billion in costs should be hidden from the taxpayers by keeping
them ``off-budget.'' The Senate, in its version, went along with
Bush's budget scheme, even though the overall costs are several
billion dollars higher in the long term because the complex
off-budget mechanism would mean higher interest payments.
   The legislation includes measures designed to more carefully
control the thrift industry to avoid future calamities. The
financial institutions have lobbied hard to minimize those new
restrictions.
   The Senate has been bogged down on a tiny piece of legislation
compared to the S&amp;L matter _ a $3.3 billion-and-growing
supplemental spending bill for the remainder of fiscal 1989.
   The White House warned that emergency spending was needed before
Memorial Day to keep veterans health programs from running out of
money, but the deadline passed without calamity.
   So the Senate plans on Tuesday to spend a third day loading up
the bill with whatever favored amendments senators can offer and
win.
   After last week's work, the bill includes such items as aid to
apple farmers whose sales have been hurt by consumers reluctant to
digest fruit sprayed with the chemical Alar, and aid to Kansas
farmers hurt by drought.
   Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,
whose committee produced the bill, included $75 million to rebuild
a 100-yard-wide radio telescope in West Virginia that collapsed
last year, and several other more earthly projects for his home
state.
   Not all amemdnets are pork barrel, and some are controversial.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., plans an amendment this week to delay a
portion of the new catastrophic illness insurance program.
   There is little controversy over the basics of the bill. It
provides $1.2 billion for veterans programs, including health care,
which need a cash influx to carry them until the end of the fiscal
year. Extra money is also provided for student loans, food stamps,
and the cost of fighting the forest fires last year in the West.
   The House has already approved its version of the spending bill.
The two chambers must settle on identical bills before the measure
can go to the president.
   Despite the busy legislative week, there will be considerable
behind-the-scenes action in the House. Foley, the No. 2 man, is a
sure bet to be smoothly installed as speaker, but the ethics
controversy also has claimed Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.,
who announced he'll step down rather than face an inquiry like the
one endured by Wright.
   With Foley moving up to speaker, that leaves the Democrats with
both their No. 2 and No. 3 slots to fill. An election on those is
expected next week and prominent Democrats are fighting for
position.
   Reps. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Ed Jenkins, D-Ga., are
competing for the majority leader post.
   The whip's race is a four-way contest between Reps. William H.
Gray III, D-Pa., Beryl Anthony, D-Ark., David Bonior, D-Mich., and
Henry Waxman, D-Calif.
   Gray spoke out sharply last week after news reports, citing
unnamed Justice Department sources, said the congressman or members
of his staff were under investigation.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Sunday called ``absolutely
false'' charges that the Justice Department has become politicized
and that senior officials there deliberately leaked the information
to embarrass Gray.
   ``I have directed that every resource that we have in the
Department of Justice be brought to bear on the investigation of
the leaks,'' Thornburgh said on the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''

<HEAD>One Israeli Soldier, Three Guerrillas Killed in Border Clash</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Three Palestinian guerrillas and an Israeli
soldier were killed in a shootout on the border with Lebanon when
the guerrillas tried to infiltrate by cutting through the fence,
the army said.
   Two soldiers were also lightly wounded, an army spokesman said
on condition of anonymity.
   It was the fourth such incident on the Israel-Lebanon border in
eight days.
   The Syrian-backed Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine claimed responsibility in a communique.
   The raid was in reprisal for retaliatory Israeli air raids on
guerrilla bases in Lebanon on Wednesday, according to the
communique released in Beirut.
   Also Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned Jewish
settlers to stop attacking Arab communities in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   Settlers have conducted raids to punish Palestinians for stoning
attacks on Israeli-owned cars. A 13-year-old Palestinian girl died
in a revenge raid last week.
   ``No one is entitled to take the law into his own hands,''
Shamir said in a statement released after a weekly Cabinet meeting.
   About 70,000 settlers live in 130 Jewish settlements in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which were captured from Jordan and Egypt in
the 1967 Middle East war. The Gaza Strip and West Bank are home to
1.7 million Palestinians.
   One Jewish settler accused of attacks on Palestinians has been
banned from entering Arab areas, the Maariv daily reported Sunday.
   The settler, David Axelrod, 22, allegedly assaulted an Israeli
soldier patrolling the West Bank town of Hebron last month.
   A Defense Ministry official confirmed the activities of a Jewish
settler had been restricted by Jerusalem but would not name him. He
said the order was the first of its kind in the 18-month-old
Palestinian uprising against Israeli control of the territories.
   Also Sunday, 22-year-old Khaled al Natur died of a gunshot wound
he suffered in a clash with troops two days earlier, officials at
Ramallah Hospital in the West Bank said.
   His death raised to 505 the number of Palestinians killed since
the uprising began. Twenty-two Israelis have died.
   The border clash was the fourth infiltration attempt into Israel
since May 28. The incident began before dawn when guerrillas opened
fire on Israeli troops patrolling a border security road north of
the Misgav Am collective farm.
   Israeli Sgt. Maj. Hassin Muktaren, who was leading the troops on
foot, died instantly of a gunshot wound, army officials said. The
three Arab commandos were killed when the soldiers returned fire,
they said.
   Israel set up the security zone in southern Lebanon in 1985 to
protect its border.
   Meanwhile, Omar Qassem, 48, a senior Palestinian guerrilla
leader who was captured by Israeli soldiers after leading a
cross-border guerrilla raid from Jordan in 1968, died Sunday in an
Israeli hospital, his family said.
   Qassem was hospitalized about two months ago with gall bladder,
kidney and liver problems. He had been serving a life sentence
ordered by an Israeli military court.
   His death came as Palestinian activists held a news conference
to appeal to Israel to release him. It also occurred as the
government considered exchanging Qassem for the remains of an
Israeli soldier believed to have died after capture in Lebanon in
1983, Israeli sources said.

<TEXT>
   In brilliant sunshine and a
stiff wind, hundreds of American paratroopers floated onto a field
in Normandy on Sunday to commemorate the jump made by the first
Allied troops on D-Day 45 years ago.
   Thousands of people gazed skyward as eight C-130 transport
planes circled overhead and 450 members of the 82nd Airborne from
Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 3rd Battalion, 325th Infantry of
Vincenza, Italy, tumbled from planes.
   ``It was windy, fast, the speed was exhilarating,'' said Sgt.
John Thomas of Freeport, N.Y., with the 82nd, known as the
``All-Americans.''
   Some of Thomas' buddies were less thrilled with the wind-driven
drop, and at least one paratrooper was injured, suffering a broken
arm.
   Spec. Mike Herman of Stamford, Conn. collided with another
paratrooper about 150 feet off the ground but was not injured.
   ``I landed a foot from the river with a face full of canopy,''
the 21-year-old paratrooper said. ``Of course I'd heard a lot of
stories about jumping here _ about church steeples and rivers and
trees _ and we knew we were in for a rough time.''
   But the demonstration jump was easy compared to the one made in
the pre-dawn darkness of June 6, 1944. Then, 1,500 American
paratroopers jumped behind enemy lines a few hours before the
seaborne assault that signaled the end of Adolf Hitler's Nazi
Germany.
   ``You could see the ground fire coming up on the paratroopers
from the Germans in Ste. Mere, red burning traces tearing through
the air. The men were clearly visible, their parachutes shining in
the moonlight,'' recalled retired Army Maj. Lewis Allen of
Fayetteville, Ark., who as a pathfinder jumped about 30 minutes
ahead of the other paratroopers on D-Day.
   While Allen watched the men being picked from the sky, more than
180,000 troops were moving across the English Channel for the
greatest amphibious assault in history.
   The invasion of Normandy's beaches, known as Operation Overlord,
began at dawn on June 6. Three million American, Canadian and
British soldiers collected in England and later reinforced the
troops who opened up a 50-mile stretch of coastline on D-Day.
   Lively and solemn ceremonies will be held over three days to
honor the Allied forces and the 367,000 soldiers who were killed or
wounded in the battle.
   It all began in Ste. Mere Eglise, with paratroopers falling like
confetti from the sky, landing in trees, in cemeteries and even on
the church steeple in an episode dramatized in the film, ``The
Longest Day.''
   The village was a crucial link between Cherbourg and Bayeux, the
bridgehead that blocked three German divisions in the North,
shielded the landing beaches only five miles away and enabled the
Americans to seal off the Contentin Peninsula within two weeks.
   ``This place meant a hell of a lot,'' Allen said, as he
autographed the back of a little French girl's jacket. ``I'm proud
of what we did, and I'm proud to be back.''

   Actress Theresa Saldana is terrified that a
crazed fan who nearly butchered her seven years ago will try to
finish his deadly ``divine mission'' after he is released from
prison next week.
   Threatening letters that wild-eyed Scottish drifter Arthur
Jackson have written to the actress have been unceasing over the
years; prison authorities cannot stop his mail. And even though
federal authorities will deport Jackson upon his release, they
agree there is nothing stopping him from returning.
   Jackson, 53, has a long history of psychiatric problems and has
been under the care of a psychiatrist in prison. But he was given a
June 15 parole date for good behavior after serving seven years of
a 12-year sentence for the vicious March 15, 1982, attack. In
California, inmates automatically earn one day off their sentence
for every day served without trouble.
   ``Threats are not considered grounds to keep a person in prison.
You have to act on the threats,'' said Deputy District Attorney
Michael E. Knight, who prosecuted Jackson.
   In a letter to Saldana after the attack, Jackson said he
regretted using a knife on her because ``a gun would have given me
a better chance of reunion with you in heaven.''
   ``It is just unbelievable that he is getting out,'' said Miss
Saldana, 34. ``I feel like I am in a nightmare. I really feel my
rights are being overlooked. Why is it life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness is being taken from me?''
   ``We know he will attempt to carry out his threats,'' said
Knight. ``But we have no way to protect her unless he tries to
carry out his threats. It doesn't speak very well for a society
that is supposed to protect the rights of all people.''
   Miss Saldana, a newlywed who is five months pregnant, said, ``It
terrifies me he will be in the streets of Europe with no
supervision.''
   Jackson spent a year in a Scottish psychiatric hospital after a
nervous breakdown at age 17. He crossed the Atlantic and joined the
U.S. Army in 1955, then suffered another mental collapse that
landed him in an Army hospital for psychiatric care.
   Jackson was discharged from the Army after a suicide attempt and
later deported to Scotland following his arrest in 1961 for
allegedly threatening President John F. Kennedy.
   He became obsessed with Miss Saldana after watching her films,
including ``Raging Bull'' and ``I Want to Hold Your Hand,'' and his
diaries revealed he thought he was on a ``divine mission'' and
could win the actress by ``sending her into eternity.'' In 1982, he
entered the United States illegally to hunt her down.
   Jackson attacked Miss Saldana outside her apartment, stabbing
her 10 times and bending the blade of his kitchen knife with the
force of his blows.
   ``I will never forget the searing, ghastly pain, the grotesque
and devastating experience of this person nearly butchering me to
death, or the bone-chilling sight or my own blood splattered
everywhere,'' Saldana told the judge in a 1984 resentencing
statement. Resentencing hearings are held when changes in
sentencing laws may affect an inmate.
   Since the attack, Miss Saldana has become a spokeswoman for
victims' rights and did a television movie about the case,
``Victims for Victims.'' She also has recently completed an action
movie, ``Angel Town.''
   Fan fanatics are not new to the show business world, but the
Saldana attack was one of the most vicious in recent memory.
   ``It isn't a case of one actress and one crazy fan. These
threats happen to others _ chronic, persistent threats. I know
other celebrities who have been threatened,'' said Miss Saldana.
   She wouldn't name names, but an obsessed fan currently faces
trial in Los Angeles on charges of threatening ``Family Ties'' TV
star Michael J. Fox and his family with death. In Connecticut, an
emotionally disturbed woman posing as the wife of talk show host
David Letterman has broken into his house several times. And in
1980, former Beatle John Lennon was shot to death near his New York
City apartment by a disturbed admirer.
   Like Miss Saldana, the delivery man who saved her life by
stopping Jackson's attack is furious about the impending release.
   ``Actually, I don't think he should even be deported. I feel he
should be here in jail for the rest of his life,'' said Jeff Fenn,
who quit his water company delivery job after the attack and became
a deputy sheriff.
   Fenn also has gotten 40 letters from Jackson, but doesn't feel
threatened.
   ``I don't see him coming after me. Now I've got a gun. I didn't
have one then,'' he said. ``He said his mission wasn't finished and
I got in his way.''

   Iran's oil minister said Sunday that a
key OPEC meeting will be sped up so he can return to Tehran for the
funeral of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was
scheduled to open a formal meeting Monday to plan its pricing and
production strategy for the rest of the year.
   Analysts expect OPEC to set a new elevated production output cap
of 19.5 million or 20 million barrels a day, a level that would
likely hold prices at current levels and do little to gasoline
prices at the pump.
   Khomeini's death Saturday raised questions about the cartel's
work schedule. Iran, a large crude oil producer, is a leading
member of the organization.
   Gholamreza Aqazadeh, the Iranian oil chief, said government
officials were not requiring that he return to Iran. But he said he
wanted to return ``to be with my people in Iran and participate in
the funeral ceremony.''
   He said the other oil ministers were discussing the situation.
   ``I think due to the circumstances, the conference will end
sooner than expected,'' he said through an interpreter.
   OPEC officials began preliminary discussions Friday on pricing
and production goals for the last six months of the year. On
Sunday, the ministers met privately in their rooms to try to
arrange a deal.
   ``We still have a way to go,'' said Libyan Oil Minister Fawzi
Shakshuki.
   The ministers appear ready to boost their production ceiling,
now at 18.5 million barrels a day, with a target price of $18 a
barrel.
   Aqazadeh said he expected demand for OPEC oil to grow about 1
million barrels a day in the last six months of the year, implying
the cartel might lift its ceiling to at least 19.5 million barrels
daily.
   He said deciding how the increase should be distributed among
the producers ``is our main problem.'' He declined to elaborate,
saying only, ``I think we will reach an agreement.''
   Oil prices have soared since the ministers late last year
slashed output in the first six months of 1989. The average price
of a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPEC is nearly $17.70 a
barrel, more than 43 percent higher than in late November.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Former Hostages In Iran React To Khomeini Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Khomeini, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans who were held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran
after the Ayatollah Khomeini and his Islamic revolution took
control mostly reacted calmly Sunday to news of the religious
leader's death.
   ``Obviously, I'm not one of his big boosters. But it doesn't
serve any purpose'' to find satisfaction in Khomeini's passing,
said Paul Lewis, a Marine guard at the U.S. Embassy in Iran when it
was seized in 1979.
   Lewis and 51 other embassy workers were held for 444 days before
being released in January 1981. He said he holds Khomeini
personally responsible for the taking of the hostages, but said he
harbors no personal grudge against the ayatollah.
   Tehran radio reported early Sunday that Khomeini died in a
hospital in the Iranian capital, 12 days after undergoing surgery
for intenstinal bleeding. He was 86.
   Lewis, a financial planner in Champaign, Ill., said the ordeal
of being held hostage was in some ways an opportunity for him to
think and sort out his priorities in life.
   ``I tried to turn it into a positive. There will be absolutely
nothing I try to do the rest of my life that will be that
traumatic,'' Lewis said. ``There's no reason I shouldn't be
successful in whatever I do. There aren't many people who get to be
tested like that.''
   Warren Christopher, former U.S. State Department negotiator and
now a Los Angeles lawyer, said of Khomeini: ``I felt so long as he
was alive there would be little improvement in U.S.-Iran relations.
He had such a monstrous hatred for the U.S. ...
   ``I wouldn't expect any immediate change. But I don't think his
level of hatred can be maintained.
   Asked if Khomeini's death will boost hopes of freeing Terry
Anderson and other Americans held hostage in Lebanon by supporters
of Iran, Christopher said:
   ``Iran certainly plays a significant role in that. His hatred so
dominated the relationship we couldn't go forward. Over time, I
would expect a more favorable relationship.''
   Another former hostage, retired Air Force Col. Thomas E.
Schaefer, was away on a trip, said his wife, Anita, in Phoenix,
Ariz.
   ``I don't think that either one of us would have too much of a
reaction to it,'' said Mrs. Schaefer. ``To say anything bad about
someone dying isn't very polite. And to say how we feel about ...
well, we don't have any comment on that.''
   ``I really don't want to comment,'' said Jerry J. Miehle of
Mount Pleasant, Pa., who was a communications officer in the U.S.
Embassy when it was taken over.
   But another former hostage, Kevin Hermening, 29, of Mosinee,
Wis., was less restrained in his reaction.
   ``It is probably the best news that has happened to the world in
a decade,'' he said. ``Iran can now move on to a post-Khomeini
era.''
   ``He was boldly marching that country into the 15th century,''
said Hermening, who was the youngest hostage.
   ``It has been such a tragic situation. That nation has an
opportunity to re-join the community of nations,'' he said.
``Hopefully this will open the door for some more normal relations
between the United States and Iran.''
   ``I'm not the type to say I'm happy he's dead,'' said another
former hostage, Barry Rosen. ``But I do feel, to a certain degree,
that that part of the nightmare is over for us and for Iran.''
   Lewis predicted turmoil in the scramble to choose a successor to
Khomeini. He said the West always underestimated Khomeini, a man
with great political savvy who ``always knew which way the wind was
blowing.''
   ``I don't think anyone ever gave him as much credit as he
deserved for being a great politician,'' Lewis said. ``Khomeini had
a great deal of influence personally. That won't be transferred to
any other person.''

<HEAD>Thirst For Outside Income Without Political Risk Underlies Predicament</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is mired in its current predicament
over ethical standards in large part because lawmakers find it
easier to accept special-interest income supplements than run the
political risk of voting themselves pay raises.
   Although partisan politics and increasing media scrutiny
contributed mightily to the atmosphere that impelled House Speaker
Jim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho to announce their
resignations, their underlying difficultly stemmed from allegations
_ formal or otherwise _ that they violated or may have violated
House rules on outside income.
   Those rules clearly allow various types of outside income. They
are much less clear in defining what counts and doesn't count as a
violation.
   In Wright's case, for example, he did not deny his financial
past. Indeed, the charges were based largely on information he
reported on public disclosure forms. What Wright argued was that
his actions did not constitute a violation of the rules. His
accusers maintained otherwise.
   Without question, members of Congress can accept campaign
contributions from special interest political action committees,
can take trips to exotic resorts paid for by special interests and
can accept cash for speeches. Those who have been around long
enough can even convert campaign contributions to personal use as
long as they pay tax on the money.
   Congress allowed various income supplements to continue even in
the post-Watergate era of reform _ so long as they were disclosed
and did not exceed certain limits. The philosophy was that each
member's constituents would get a chance to decide at the polls
each two years whether they approved of the way their
representative was conducted his or her financial affairs.
   There was considerable support in the House earlier this year
for proposals to ban speaking fees and other outside earned income
in exchange for an across-the-board pay raise.
   But there was an intense public outcry against a pay raise _
initially a 50 percent boost that would raise salaries from $89,000
to $135,000 _ and there was little support for banning honoraria
without a salary increase to compensate for what, in effect, would
be a pay cut for many members.
   On top of the ethics charges already brewing against him, Wright
came under criticism from outsiders for appearing to be trying to
engineer the raise without a vote and _ privately _ from some of
his colleagues for not trying hard enough to get the raise through
without a vote.
   Wright had believed the 50 percent pay raise was too large and
eventually favored having the House vote on a 30 percent increase.
But the vast majority of members didn't want to be recorded as
voting for any pay raise.
   Then came the wrenching partisan political battle over President
Bush's nomination of former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, to be
secretary of defense. Tower was defeated, and fellow Wright, a
fellow Texan, complained after his own downfall that he had been
victimized by vengeance-seeking Republicans.
   Congressional Republicans were eager to exploit the Wright
ethics problem because Democrats had tried to use the so-called
``sleaze issue'' against Republicans during the 1988 presidential
campaign, referring often to the many Reagan administration
officials who had run afoul of executive branch ethics rules.
   ``Some people have said that the (ethical) standards have
changed,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, the
self-styled citizens lobby. ``That is not the case. What has
happened is that standards that have existed for years are now
being enforced _ standards that for too long had not been paid
attention to.''
   Wertheimer said that while salary increases are ``greatly
needed,'' the more pressing need is for Congress to cleanse itself
of special-interest influence. ``The way of life on Capitol Hill
has to be changed so that the money chase is ended. You have
members of Congress right now who live off special interests, both
professionally and personally.''
   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the private American
Enterprise Institute, said Congress would not be likely to solve
the problem by coupling a pay raise with a prohibition on speaking
fees and other special interest money. But he suggested such a move
might be worth trying in the present circumstance.
   ``You'd still get (consumer activist) Ralph Nader going bananas
and radio talk show hosts going ballistic,'' he said, ``but I do
think the public would eventually accept it.''
   John F. Banzhat, a George Washington University law professor,
said that while he doesn't believe members of Congress are
underpaid, there has to be a dramatic change in the system _ even
if that means a pay increase.
   ``What they're doing is taking payola,'' he said. ``We told disc
jockeys at radio stations years ago that they couldn't do that, and
congressmen still do.''
   He said that while Congress has shown itself more sensitive to
ethical problems in recent years, its rules of conduct often
amounted merely to ``fine-tuning the amount of payola they could
take.''
   In the meantime, members of Congress vent their frustrations
publicly and Republicans and Democrats engage in what Ornstein
called a congressional adaptation of the war between the Hatfields
and the McCoys.
   ``Politics is a blood sport and an unforgiving business,'' said
Rep. James Slattery, D-Kan. ``The reality is _ and you know this
going in _ you can make a mistake even after 30 or 40 years of
service and your career can end.''

<TEXT>
   The pastor of a suburban church called for
compassion Sunday for Robert and Delores Clark as Clark faces
charges that he murdered members of his family 18 years ago in New
Jersey.
   ``We pray that falsehood and sensationalism will be replaced
with truth and compassion,'' the Rev. Joseph M. Vought of the
Lutheran Church of Our Savior told the 80 people attending services
Sunday morning.
   FBI agents arrested ``Clark'' on Thursday and charged him with
fleeing to avoid prosecution. Agents said fingerprints showed that
Clark is really John E. List, accused of slaying his mother, his
first wife, and their three children on Nov. 9, 1971, in Westfield,
N.J. The bodies were found about a month later.
   The arrest followed a tip resulting from the Fox Broadcasting
Co. ``America's Most Wanted'' program May 21 that dramatized the
slayings.
   Vought preached about the tragedy of the death of a child and
referred to a biblical passage about Jesus raising a dead child
from death. He said he knew many people were thinking, ``If God
heals broken people, why not Bob and Delores?''
   Mrs. Clark did not attend the service in the church in
Chesterfield County. Police had said she was unaware of her
husband's past but cooperated with investigators. She has been in
seclusion, but told a newspaper last week that she hoped ``somehow
that this is not true'' and that ``somehow God will see us through
this.''
   Members of the congregation were reluctant to talk about the man
they knew as Robert P. Clark.
   ``It's a close-knit congregation,'' said Victor Caudle, who said
he was a newcomer to the church and had not known the couple.
   Clark waived a bond hearing scheduled for Monday and remained in
the Henrico County jail Sunday. Another hearing is scheduled
Thursday in federal court in Richmond.

   President Bush returned to the White House
from a 10-day trip on Sunday, faced with new foreign policy
challenges stemming from the bloody military crackdown in China and
the death of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   On the flight from Maine to Washington, White House spokesman
Bob Hall told reporters that the president was being updated
regularly on developments by Robert Gates, his deputy national
security adviser.
   Hall said Bush had no meetings or appointments planned at the
White House on Sunday. On Monday, he will meet with bipartisan
leaders of Congress in a session that had been scheduled before the
bloodbath in China and the death of Khomeini.
   Bush made no public comment on the death of the 89-year-old
radical Iranian leader, who had branded the United States as the
devil.
   A White House statement said, ``With his passing, we hope Iran
will now move toward assuming a responsible role in the
international community.''
   Bush spent two days at his seaside estate at Kennebunkport,
Maine, driving his speedboat, fishing and jogging, after returning
from a week-long trip to Italy, Belgium, West Germany and England
and a NATO summit.
   The president initially appeared unaware of Khomeini's death,
announced shortly before midnight Saturday.
   Jogging near his seaside home at 6:30 a.m. EDT, Bush was asked
by a reporter whether he had heard about Khomeini. When Bush
replied, ``No,'' the reporter shouted that the ayatollah had died.
   The president declined to comment. He also brushed aside
questions about China, where hundreds of people were reported
killed in a crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Bush was asked about Khomeini and China again when he attended
Sunday services with his wife, Barbara, at First Congregational
Church of Kennebunkport, where they frequently worship.
   He made no comment, other than to point out the White House had
issued a statement about Khomeini.
   The White House issued a separate statement Saturday night in
Bush's name about China. It said, ``I deeply deplore the decision
to use force against peaceful demonstrators and the consequent loss
of life.''
   Urging Beijing to use nonviolent tactics, Bush said, ``I hope
that China will rapidly return to the path of political and
economic reform and conditions of stability so that this
relationship (between the United States and China), so important to
both our peoples, can continue its growth.''
   The president and his wife were greeted on a first-name basis at
the church by the Rev. Robert Howes, who informed the congregation
he was retiring as pastor.
   He also told Bush, ``All of us are filled with new hopes and
confidence because of the work you have just completed in Europe.''
He said the president's efforts made the world a safer place.
   At the NATO summit, Bush proposed that the United States and
Soviet Union reduce combat troops in Europe to 275,000 on each side
and make other cuts in conventional forces.
   He also helped engineer a settlement of a dispute on short-range
nuclear missiles.
   Mrs. Bush, talking to the congregation, recalled her visit last
Sunday to a church in Nettuno, Italy, near a cemetery where
Americans are buried from World War II.
   ``We went to this little church, didn't understand a word (of
the Italian service), but we understood the spirit _ the same
family spirit that we have here.''

   Congressional leaders, clergymen and constituents
welcomed U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper home for the last time Sunday,
eulogizing him as a``guardian of the elderly'' who left his mark in
the hearts of the common people.
   The 88-year-old congressman, who died Tuesday in Washington, was
praised in his downtown church as a shining example of U.S.
citizenship, filled with passion and dedication to those who needed
his help and influence the most.
   ``He will never be replaced,'' said U.S. Rep. John Moakley,
D-Mass. Moakley said Pepper ``in a very real sense remains with
us,'' with a long record of accomplishments.
   Friends and admirers of Pepper were joined by three busloads of
members of Congress and staff, including resigning U.S. House
Speaker Jim Wright, his designated successor, Rep. Tom Foley of
Washington, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Tennessee Sen. Al
Gore Jr. They were flown to Miami International Airport from
Washington in three military planes.
   Gephardt said Pepper's story is written in the law books and
hearts of America. Wherever the elderly are living in dignity, or
wherever sick children are healed, ``there is a sign that says
Claude was here,'' Gephardt said.
   Wright, noting Pepper's efforts for decent housing and adequate
medical care, added, ``What greater legacy can any man give than
that?''
   During the 1{-hour service, Pepper's body lay in a coffin draped
with an American flag and flanked by colorful sprays of flowers.
The 2,000-seat church appeared to be about two-thirds full.
   Security was tight, with sweeps of the church an hour before the
2 p.m. service began. One woman in a formal white dress created a
disturbance during Wright's eulogy and was physically removed from
the church by five security officials. She was taken into police
custody for observation.
   Sunday's service was the latest in a series of events to mourn
and honor Pepper, who lay in state in the Capitol in Washington
last week.
   The casket then was to be flown to Tallahassee to lie in state
in the Old Capitol Rotunda Sunday night. A funeral at First Baptist
Church and burial at Oaklawn Cemetery in Tallahassee have been
scheduled Monday.
   Rabbi Irving Lehrman, calling Pepper ``the guardian of the
elderly,'' said he had ``a heart as big as the world ... a heart
that had room for all people, regardless of race, color and creed.''
   Combined choirs sang ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic,'' as
Pepper had once requested.
   Several hundred persons lined up Saturday at the historic
downtown church for a public viewing of Pepper's open casket. His
funeral and burial were scheduled Monday in Tallahassee.
   Pepper was a New Deal senator for 14 years, but was ousted in a
1950 campaign in which he was maligned as ``Red Pepper'' for his
liberalism and alleged softness on communism.
   Pepper won election to the U.S. House in 1962 and eventually
became the oldest member of Congress, representing an urban
district that spanned everything from the exclusive mansions of
Miami Beach to a shelter for the homeless blocks from his church.
   Gov. Bob Martinez will later this week set a special election to
fill Pepper's 18th District seat.

   Liberal and conservative congressional leaders
both demanded Sunday that President Bush end military aid to China
in retaliation for the government's bloody suppression of
pro-democracy demonstrators.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., warned that unless Bush takes a
stronger stand on China, ``Congress will do it for him.''
   The president, who spent the weekend relaxing at his
Kennebunkport, Maine, home, brushed off reporters' questions about
the blood-letting as he took an early morning jog on Sunday.
   Upon his return to the White House, the president again chose to
offer no response to reporters' queries about the crisis.
   In Washington, leading members of the president's own party
demanded action.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, chairman of the House
Republican Policy Committee, criticized what he called the
administration's ``excessively cautious'' reaction to the military
crackdown in Beijing.
   ``Diplomatic messages of disapproval are a pretty puny reaction
to the murdering of innocent civilians, whose only crime is to want
the same freedoms we in the West take for granted,'' Edwards said
in a statement issued by his office.
   ``The Defense Department, the State Department and the Commerce
Department ought to act immediately, in unison, to put some
substance into the U.S. condemnations,'' he said.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday a State
Department task force has been mulling over policy options for the
president, adding, ``there is no indication of what direction we
might go, or when he would get the specific options.''
   Asked about demands for cuts in U.S. military aid, Fitzwater
said the administration did not ``want to act precipitously. We
want to make sure that our response is correct.''
   ``There are a number of ways that the United States government
can express itself in this matter. It's appropriate that we act in
the right fashion and not too quickly,'' Fitzwater said. ``We'll
consider all the options and choose an appropriate course when the
time is right.''
   Solarz, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian
subcommittee, and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., ranking GOP member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed outrage at the
violent turn of events in Beijing and demanded a review of the
U.S.-China relationship.
   ``I think it would be politically unacceptable and morally
unthinkable ... for us to continue to sell arms to a country that
is engaged in the wanton slaughter of its own people,'' Solarz said.
   Helms, who vowed to ask the Senate on Monday to approve such a
step, said he believes there is ``strong bipartisan support'' for
the move.
   Indeed, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., chairman of Foreign
Relations subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific affairs, also
called for a halt to all military assistance and cooperation with
the People's Republic, saying U.S.-Chinese relations had been dealt
``a bloody blow.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., another member of the Senate
panel, advised a cautious approach, approving of Bush's ``calm and
stable'' response to the situation.
   ``He ought to keep our ambassador there ... we ought to keep
maintain our agreements (to supply aid),'' Lugar said on NBC-TV's
``Meet the Press.'' The senator said the U.S. leverage in the
matter is ``always very limited. There are some situations we
really cannot control.''
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who helped forge the
first U.S. ties to China during President Nixon's term, also
advised that the president ``can't afford emotional outbursts'' in
the present situation.
   Appearing on ABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley,''
Kissinger said he was ``appalled'' by the events in Beijing but
cautioned that the United States must be ``very careful''' about
considering cutting ties with the Chinese in order not to give the
Soviet Union ``a free ride'' in influence in Asia.
   But Solarz appeared to be unsatisfied by Bush's statement on
Saturday, calling for ``nonviolence, restraint and dialogue.''
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a Saturday television
appearance, called the events ``extremely deplorable'' and said the
U.S. government was ``disturbed'' by the violent turn of events.
   ``I think we have to manifest our concern over what happened in
China by deeds as well as words. It's simply not sufficient to say
that we are disturbed by what happened,'' Solarz said on CBS-TV's
``Face The Nation.''
   ``We have to make it clear that the United States will not
continue to conduct business as usual with a government that
engages in the wanton slaughter of its own people. And I have to
say that if the president doesn't take the initiative in changing
American policy in this regard, the Congress will do it for him,''
Solarz said.
   The U.S.-Chinese relationship has blossomed on economic,
military and political fronts since formal diplomatic relations
were established in 1979.
   Since that time, the United States has sold more than $748
million in arms to China, most recently a $100 million deal in
which Beijing purchased six Chinook CH-47D helicopters manufactured
by Boeing Co.
   China, with U.S. approval, also reached a $245 million agreement
with Grumman Corp. in 1987 under which the U.S. company improved
the avionics of China's F-8 fighter jet.
   ``We never should have gotten into the business of supplying
arms to any communist country,'' Helms said, adding he wanted to
``cut off all that sort of thing.''
   Helms, a longtime foe of relations with Communist China, said
``the (China) military needs to understand that there will be a
harsh reaction'' if the violence continues.
   Besides calling for the immediate return of Ambassador James
Lilley, Solarz sad the United States should consider a suspension
of trade in high-technology items, and a change in immigration
regulations to allow those Chinese students now in America who
supported the democratic movement to remain here until it is clear
they won't be punished upon their return.
   The State Department has set up a round-the-clock desk to
monitor the situation in China.
   One official confirmed that the Chinese Ambassador, Han Xu, had
been called into the State Department on Saturday to hear the U.S.
expression of ``deep concern'' about the violent developments in
China.
   U.S. officials are ``in constant touch'' with Chinese officials
in Beijing and Washington, the official said.

<HEAD>Japan Threatens Formal GATT Complaint Against U.S.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan threatened Sunday to file a
formal complaint against the United States under the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, claiming it had been accused of
protectionism under a new U.S. trade law.
   Shigeo Muraoka, Japan's vice minister for international trade
and industry, said he considered filing an official complaint
before the 96-nation trade forum a ``possible approach.''
   The U.S. government last month identified Japan, Brazil and
India as nations that had erected unfair barriers against imports
of American goods, in line with a recently beefed up section of a
U.S. trade act known as Super 301.
   The new rule has irritated Japan, the European Economic
Community and other competitors because it opens the way for
Washington to impose retaliatory sanctions without waiting for
GATT's permission.
   ``The U.S. hasn't done anything that would be a basis for a
(Japanese) complaint,'' U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said.
``We have simply exposed, open for the world to see, where trade
barriers are.''
   ``If we have to retaliate, we've failed in our discussions,''
she added. ``We don't like to fail.''
   Trade minsters from the U.S., Japan, Canada and the 12-nation
EEC are meeting informally in the Hague.
   Muraoka, who spoke to reporters after the meeting, said the new
U.S. law ``seriously undermines the spirit of free trade.''
   He said the U.S. should ask GATT to set up a panel to
investigate the American allegations to resolve the dispute,
Muraoka said.
   Alternatively, Japan might request a GATT working group to
determine whether the law is consistent with the trade forum's
rules, he said. GATT should also encourage bilateral talks between
Washington and other nations targeted by the measure, Muraoka said.
   The EEC has sharply criticized the trade act and said the
European trade bloc or any of its member nations could be targeted
by the new rule in the future.
   Super 301 requires the U.S. government to announce publicly what
countries it suspects of protectionism and to begin bilateral talks
in order to resolve the problem.
   The U.S. claims that if talks fail it can impose trade sanctions
against the offending nation without GATT permission. GATT rules
say permission is necessary.

<HEAD>Media Giants Settle Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. and News Corp. have
settled a three-week old, $1.5 billion lawsuit in which the Rupert
Murdoch-controlled company accused Disney of fraud.
   News Corp.'s satellite TV company, Sky Television, had claimed
in the suit that Disney had failed to meet terms of its agreement
to launch the Disney Channel in the British satellite network.
   Sky Television operates four direct broadcast channels _ sending
directly from a communications satellite to a dish at the
consumer's home. The deal with Disney called for it to supply 18
hours of daily programming.
   Besides starting a Disney Channel for the new enterprise in
England, Disney also had agreed to help operate a pay-per-view
service called Sky Movies, according to the suit.
   But News Corp. alleged that Disney dragged its feet, seeking to
change the terms of the agreement. News Corp. sought $1 billion in
punitive damages and $500 million in actual damages in the May 15
lawsuit.
   Under terms of the agreement announced late Friday, Sky will
purchase Disney's undisclosed interest in the joint venture, and
Sky will continue to license Disney films from Touchstone Pictures
and its newly announced Hollywood Pictures production company for
the next five years.
   Disney and Sky Television will continue to discuss terms of a
possible Disney Channel, but Disney is no longer obligated to
supply the programming and apparently is free to go elsewhere and
establish a foothold in recently deregulated European television.
   Murdoch, the British communications and publishing mogul, has
said he hopes the Sky Television service can reach 1 million
satellite dish customers in Great Britain and Ireland by early 1990.
   Walt Disney Studios president Richard Frank said Disney ``will
continue to pursue opportunities for establishing The Disney
Channel in these key markets.''
   The lawsuit had said Barry Diller, head of Fox Inc., the Los
Angeles-based entertainment group owned by News Corp., intervened
and asked Disney executives for better cooperation. Diller worked
with Disney Chairman Michael Eisner for nearly 16 years at both
Paramount Pictures and ABC.
   Eisner denied Friday that the two men clashed over the issue.
   ``I never had any quarrel with Barry, and Disney never had any
quarrel with 20th Century Fox. Our dealings were always with the
British subsidiary of News Corp.,'' Eisner said.
   The Disney chief said he dealt directly with Murdoch in settling
the suit.
