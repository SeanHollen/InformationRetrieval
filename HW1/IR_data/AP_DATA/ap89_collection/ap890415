   Hu Yaobang, head of China's Communist Party from
1980 until he was ousted in disgrace in 1987, died Saturday after
suffering a heart attack. He was 74.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Hu suffered a heart attack
on April 8 from which he never recovered. The news agency said Hu
died of extensive cardiac infarction, an obstruction of blood
vessels, at 7:53 a.m. Saturday (7:53 p.m. Friday EDT).
   According to the South China Morning Post daily newspaper of
Hong Kong, Hu suffered the heart attack during a meeting last
Saturday of the Communist Party Politburo, the party's top
decision-making body.
   Hu, although retaining his seat in the 17-member Politburo, made
few official appearances and had become a nearly forgotten figure
in Chinese politics after his dramatic ouster in January 1987.
   Hu survived 10 years of political purgatory to emerge as head of
the 47-million member Communist Party, but then was purged again as
he stood on the brink of becoming China's most powerful man.
   Hu was one of China's most outspoken critics of the leftist
excesses of Mao Tse-tung's 1966-76 Cultural Revolution that
banished him to exile, and became a leading pragmatist in
encouraging a more market-oriented economy and greater private
initiative.
   It was his tendency to speak out in a nation where private
opinions are discouraged, and his tolerance toward critics of the
socialist system, that led to his ouster as party general secretary
in 1987, at the height of the campaign against ``bourgeois
liberalization.''
   Despite charges that he had permitted Westernization and
pro-capitalist sentiments in China, Hu was a dedicated nationalist
and party member. He joined the Communist guerrilla forces at age
14 and never left a doubt that party ideals took precedence over
everything, including personal and press freedoms.
   Hu became head of the Communist Party in February 1980, and was
allied closely to senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whom he first met in
1941. The longtime bridge partners shared the conviction that
China, in order to escape the grinding poverty of the past and grow
economically, must not repeat the political upheavals that marked
the communists' first quarter-century in power.
   It was widely believed that Hu was in line to take over some of
Deng's functions, including head of the party's powerful Central
Military Commission, when Deng finally left the scene.
   However, Hu had long alienated some conservatives with his blunt
criticisms of Mao's policies and the military reportedly hedged its
support for a man who had never held a senior military position.
   In the end, Deng, reportedly angered when Hu on several
occasions bypassed his orders or made decisions without consulting
other party leaders, is believed to have played a key role in
engineering Hu's ``resignation.''
   Hu in particular was blamed for allowing an atmosphere that
resulted in widespread pro-democracy student demonstrations in
December 1986.
   Hu was born in 1915 in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, 72 miles
from the birthplace of Mao.
   Like Deng and others who later rose to the top echelons of the
party, Hu took part in the Long March of 1934-35. He was a party
official in Sichuan Province when the communists drove the
Nationalist government to Taiwan and took over power in 1949.
   In 1952 he became secretary of the Communist Youth League, and
four years later joined the party's Central Committee.
   In 1966, as head of the Youth League, Hu became a prime target
of Mao's Cultural Revolution. Red Guards shaved his head, forced
him to crawl on his hands and knees in an act of public humiliation
and sent him to rural Henan Province for 2{ years.
   Among his alleged sins, the leftists charged Hu and Deng, who
was also banished to the countryside, used railroad cars and
special airplanes to ferry bridge partners around the country.
   After Henan, Hu underwent another two years being
``re-educated'' and five years under house arrest. In 1975 he
resurfaced as an official of the Academy of Sciences.
   In 1977 Hu became head of the party's Organization Department,
where he supervised the redress of frame-ups during the Cultural
Revolution.
   By 1980, Hu was elected secretary-general of the party Central
Committee, and served as party chairman, the post once held by Mao,
until the title was abolished in 1982.
   Hu was 5-foot, 3-inches, slightly taller than Deng, and like
Deng, a heavy smoker.
   In 1983 he revealed he had four children and five grandchildren.
His wife was reported to be a retired textile factory manager.

   Sam Rogoway has been in front of a mike
since he was a tyke.
   Now he puts it to you this way:
   ``Hey, mammas and papas, brothers and sisters ... Are you ready
to rock 'n' roll your souls and get down to the deepest hole in the
bottom of the bowl? ... I'm Little Ricky Rocko, the world's
youngest disc jockey.''
   Every Friday, 9-year-old Sam is excused from his fourth-grade
classes to perform a one-hour live show with two grown-up DJs.
   In the studio, he stands on a box to reach a microphone half the
size of his head. Lately he's grown tall enough to reach the
headphone switch, something he couldn't do two years ago when he
started.
   Sam takes his music seriously. He likes heavy metal _ Guns &amp;
Roses, Def Leppard, Poison _ and his favorite group is Bon Jovi.
   ``Little Ricky Rocko's Rockin' Report,'' a 15-minute weekly
segment, tells the latest rock music news. Sam's father, Dave
Rogoway, said the program is heading for syndication.
   ``Sam has always had good verbal skills,'' his father said. ``He
never did the goo-goo thing. He just got up in his crib and started
talking.''
   He was still little when he began imitating his father, whose
own brief career as a disc jockey started at age 14.
   For hours, 5-year-old Sam would amuse himself with a toy disc
jockey set and his father's records.
   ``He was absolutely obsessed,'' Rogoway recalled. ``It got to
the point that if I heard (The Beach Boys') `Fun, Fun, Fun' again,
I was going to take the thing back.''
   In 1987, Rogoway was making a commercial at a local radio
station and he took Sam along to make a fun tape of the boy's disc
jockey persona.
   Rogoway was transferring the tape to a cassette when the station
manager heard the juvenile voice of ``Little Ricky Rocko.''
   It was the sound of a great radio gimmick.
   In 1987, Sam recorded his first show for KAAR-AM in Vancouver,
Wash. Last year he switched to KKRZ-FM in Portland.
   His father said Little Ricky Rocko earns ``more than the
medium-income wage earner'' for the two programs and several
personal appearances a week.
   In an interview, Sam said: ``I lead like two lives. I go to
school and go home and play basketball and I'm Sam Rogoway. Then I
have to turn into a different person when I'm Little Ricky Rocko.''
   The ``world's youngest disc jockey'' has appeared on ``Good
Morning, America'' and chatted with Dick Clark, who recently
retired as ``the world's oldest teen-ager.''
   It's OK with his parents if Sam wants to take voice and acting
lessons come summer. But what Sam wants most is to have his own
band by the time he's 13. But boys' plans _ like boys' voices _
have a way of changing.
   His parents have tried to explain that program formats change
and radio stations get sold, too.
   ``That's my greatest fear,'' Rogoway said. ``If the bit died, no
matter how much he's been prepared. I think it would take him time
to get adjusted to a regular kid's life.''

   The European parliament has called for
stiffer legislation against prostitution, saying it is a crime not
unlike slavery.
   In a resolution Friday, the parliament proposed uniform, tougher
penalties on prostitution throughout the 12-country European
Community.
   The 518-member assembly called for giving women involved in
prostitution more educational and job opportunities. It proposed
special aid to women in poorer areas and countries where most
prostitutes come from, including special programs helping country
women adapt to the strains of urban life.
   The assembly also called for measures against pornography and
communication systems that help promote prostitution such as the
French Minitel, a popular teletext network.

   Federal retirees have their eyes on $1.4
billion in state income tax refunds after a U.S. Supreme Court
ruling that orders states to tax federal and state pensions equally
or not at all.
   The lawsuit, filed by a Michigan man who figures to save $800 a
year on his state taxes, could benefit more than 1.1 million
retirees.
   The state hit hardest is Virginia, where 200,000 federal
civilian and military retirees could be owed $150 million in
refunds this year.
   At least 20 others states could be affected, according to an
Associated Press survey that indicates the states could lose $461
million a year in future revenue because of the ruling and could
owe $1.4 billion if refunds for prior years are required.
   About 1,000 telephone calls have poured into the National
Association of Retired Federal Employees following the March 28
ruling, said spokesman Denis Harrington.
   ``They're telling us, `We want our money back,''' he said.
   ``It was a bombshell we knew might happen and now has
happened,'' said Oklahoma House Speaker Jim Barker, whose state
could lose $22 million a year.
   Paul Davis, a former lawyer with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission who lives in East Lansing, said he filed the
lawsuit in 1984 because Michigan taxed part of his federal pension,
but not the pensions of state and local government retirees.
   The court ruled that the retirees must be treated equally _ both
taxed or both exempt _ and sent the case back to the Michigan Court
of Appeals.
   ``I didn't anticipate the impact would be so large on states
like Virginia,'' said Davis, who represented himself in the lawsuit.
   States initially believed the cost would be small, until they
realized military as well as civilian pensions were involved, said
Harley Duncan, executive director of the Federation of Tax
Administrators.
   ``The word `Davis' is the most commonly used word in state tax
departments this week,'' he said.
   At least 21 states treat federal pensions differently from state
and local ones, according to Ronald Snell, senior program director
for fiscal affairs of the National Conference of State Legislatures.
   In Missouri, Senate Appropriations Chairman Roger Wilson said
the $43 million annual loss, and the possibility of owing $166
million in refunds, could mean a tax increase or deep cuts in the
budget.
   ``If you're looking for the devil with the shortest horns, there
ain't one out there. They are all extra long,'' he said.
   Virginia Gov. Gerald L. Baliles has called lawmakers back for a
special legislative session on April 24 to deal with the issue,
which could cost the state $450 million if it is required to refund
overpayments from prior years.
   Elsewhere, West Virginia amended its law to give federal
retirees the same tax break as state and local retirees.
   In Montana, a proposed measure would exempt all pension income
from taxation. Oregon lawmakers created a special joint committee
to find a solution and Georgia is mulling the need for a special
legislative session.
   Arizona Gov. Rose Mofford recommended taxing state and local
retirement income on the same basis as federal.
   Some states, including Michigan and New Mexico, maintain that
refunds aren't required for prior years.
   While states decide how to comply with the ruling, the National
Association of Retired Federal Employees is urging federal retirees
to seek refunds for as many years as their states' statute of
limitation permits.
   Harrington said amended returns should be filed by this year's
state income tax filing deadline in order to preserve as many years
as possible under the statute of limitations.
   For the 1988 tax year, he said, retirees are being told to pay
the tax and file an amended return.
   States believed by the National Conference of State Legislatures
to be affected are: Arizona, Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon,
South Carolina, Utah, Virginia and West Virginia.

<HEAD>Remember Mike Dukakis? In Massachusetts They Do, And Not Fondly</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER B. DALY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A few days after Michael Dukakis lost the
presidential election, a London wax museum yanked a model of the
defeated candidate from public view. It was the shortest exhibition
in the museum's history.
   At home, Gov. Dukakis is still on display most days at the
Statehouse, but critics, and even some supporters, suggest he has
become something of an invisible figure.
   It's been a long, hard winter for Dukakis. He has announced a
deficit in the state budget, made himself a lame duck, proposed $1
billion in new spending, asked taxpayers to cover the shortfall,
and taken a dive in public opinion polls.
   He has also seen his wife, Kitty, through a monthlong
residential treatment program for alcoholism.
   April is proving to be another cruel month. Massachusetts is
facing a water shortage, Dukakis' mother has been in the hospital,
and members of his own party are writing him off as irrelevant.
   One legislative leader emerged from a budget-crisis meeting in
Dukakis' office last week and told reporters that taxes weren't
mentioned and neither was the ``L-word.'' When reporters asked
which L-word he had in mind, the leader said, ``Loser.''
   Through it all, Dukakis has chugged along in the slow-but-sure
style that marked his campaign, leaving his shrinking circle of
admirers to marvel at his steadiness and giving his critics more
reason to believe _ as Ted Koppel said _ that he just doesn't get
it.
   After more than a quarter-century in public life, Dukakis
himself takes a long view.
   ``Steady as she goes,'' Dukakis said when asked about the
state's multiple problems.
   ``He seems to have the attitude that this too shall pass,''
observed state Rep. Nicholas Paleologos, a fellow Greek and fellow
Democrat who was one of Dukakis' staunchest supporters.
   ``He's clicked off of the presidential campaign, and he's
clicked back onto being governor. He burns at about the same
temperature no matter what he does,'' Paleologos said.
   ``He really has become a non-entity, at the Statehouse,''
commented Barbara Anderson, the leader of Citizens for Limited
Taxation, who shoveled anti-Dukakis ammunition to the Bush forces
last year.
   Democratic state Rep. William Galvin traced the governor's slump
to two events that followed Dukakis' acknowledgment in December
that the state was $600 million short on a $12 billion budget.
   Galvin said Dukakis lost public support with his $735 million
tax plan and lost legislative support when he ruled out another run
for governor in 1990.
   ``A year ago, not only was he governor, he was a governor who
might be president,'' the Boston Democrat said, adding that
lame-duck status diminishes any politician's authority, ``whether
they're president or governor or sewer commissioner.''
   On the national scene, Dukakis nearly vanished as quickly as the
London waxworks display, which was on view for only 40 days.
   Two weekends ago, when many prominent politicians were in
Washington for a mammoth pro-choice rally, Dukakis was in New York
City for a Greek Independence Day parade, and he barely made a
ripple.
   The Democrats' new national chairman, Ron Brown, was in Boston
recently and told a luncheon of politicians and contributors that
the Democrats are in great shape except for presidential politics.
As guests nodded, Brown said the problem in 1988 was a slow-footed
campaign that lacked a message and let the Republicans define the
terms.
   Dukakis was sitting about 10 feet away.
   Statewide poll results in early February had the governor's
favorability rating down from his usual range in 70s to 43.5
percent and his unfavorable rating at an all-time high of 52.7
percent.
   Still, the governor's top aides and close friends insist that
things will work out.
   Paul Brountas, the governor's oldest friend, who chaired the
presidential campaign, had lunch with Dukakis recently.
   ``I think he's in great shape,'' Brountas said. ``People get
angry at their basketball team if they lose in the finals. They
don't treat them so badly if they lose in the semi-finals. It's
like any loss. People are disappointed.''

   A jealous winery worker went on a
bloody rampage Friday and killed five people, including his wife
and mother-in-law, then fled with his three young daughters,
authorities said.
   Police helicopters searched the lush Sonoma Valley region of
vineyards and wineries in California's wine country and authorities
issued an all-points bulletin for Ramon Salcido, 28.
   Police found Salcido's battered brown Ford sedan with a torn
vinyl top Friday night in San Rafael, about 25 miles to the south,
but there was no sign of Salcido or his daughters.
   Authorities, who had alerted border police for fear that Salcido
might be heading for his native Mexico, continued to look for a
second car he might be driving, a 1960 Plymouth with a burned spot
on the hood.
   Investigators went to the home of Salcido's in-laws and found
the bodies of his mother-in-law and her two young daughters, who
had been beaten and bludgeoned to death; at Salcido's home, they
found the body of his wife.
   He's also accused of killing one co-worker and wounding another.
   Most of the victims ``did not die by gunshot wounds but very
violent injuries,'' said Sonoma County Sheriff Richard Michaelsen.
   Michaelsen said authorities feared for the three missing
toddlers because of brutal attacks on Salcido's two young
sisters-in-law.
   ``He may have literally no attachment to his own children at
this point,'' the sheriff said. ``We feel they are in great
danger.''
   Michaelsen said Salcido's sisters-in-law Marie Ann Richards, 8,
and Ruth Richards, 12, were sexually assaulted, sodomized and
beaten; one of the girls was nearly decapitated.
   The fifth victim was shot to death near the Grand Cru Winery,
where Salcido worked.
   One investigator described the in-laws' house as ``one of the
most horrible crime scenes he had seen in his life, a violent,
violent attack,'' Michaelsen said. One body was found in a bedroom,
a second in the kitchen and the third in a hall.
   Salcido was believed to be armed with several weapons,
Michaelsen said, but authorities had not determined the sequence of
events in Friday's violence.
   The gunman went to the ranch of a locally prominent man, Bob
Kunde, and shot ranch worker Kenneth Butti in the right shoulder,
Michaelsen said. Butti, 33, was treated and discharged from Santa
Rosa Memorial Hospital.
   Then Salcido went to the winery and fatally shot a male
co-worker, assistant winemaker Tracey Toovey, before fleeing in his
battered brown Ford sedan, Michaelsen said. Toovey's body was found
in a car near the winery.
   He went to his home in nearby Boyes Hot Springs, where the body
believed to be his wife, Angela Elaine Richards, was found,
Michaelsen said. Salcido's three children, ages 2, 3 and 4, were
reported missing.
   Later, authorities found three bodies at the home of Salcido's
father-in-law, Robert L. Richards, in Cotati, about five miles west
of here, said sheriff's Lt. Gary Zanolini. The bodies were
identified as Salcido's mother-in-law, Louise, and two of the
Richards' young daughters. Richards was not home at the time and
was uninjured.
   Salcido's neighbor, Richard Clark, said he ``could see it
coming.'' Clark, who has known Salcido for about four years, said
his neighbor ``liked guns and liked scaring people with guns.''
   ``He's crazy, he was always going around with a gun,'' said
Clark. ``One time he threatened to blow (his wife's) head off.''
   ``He said if he found someone ... with his wife he'd kill them.
He was real jealous. He drank a lot. Two or three times a day he
would come home from the winery to see if someone was with his
wife,'' Clark said.
   On March 11, a Superior Court judge in Fresno County, some 250
miles to the south, issued an order directing Salcido to pay his
ex-wife Debra Ann $511 a month in child support for their daughter,
Maria Crystal Garcia, 4.
   He also was ordered to repay the county $5,807 in public
assistance apparently paid to his ex-wife after he failed to
provide support for the child. There was no indication when Salcido
was notified of the order.
   Glen Ellen is a town of 1,500 in the wine-making region of
Sonoma County, north of San Francisco. Grand Cru, founded in 1970
and owned by Walter and Bettina Dreyer, covers 30 acres and
produces about 60,000 cases of wine a year.
   A woman at the winery declined to comment and referred all
questions to the sheriff's department.

   The Exxon oil slick washed ashore at
another national park Friday as state and federal officials
criticized the giant corporation's ``entirely inadequate'' cleanup
and declared, ``This is a war.''
   ``We've got oil on the beach at Katmai National Park,'' said
John Quinley, a Park Service spokesman.
   The the oil washed up at the Big River area along the park's
northern coast _ a spectacular, undeveloped area beside the stormy
Shelikof Strait, more than 250 miles from where the Exxon Valdez
tanker rammed a reef on March 24.
   Observers from a plane saw a bear digging clams from the tainted
sand, and more wildlife seemed certain to die, Quinley said.
   ``There's no way to know how much he digested, but I think it's
a safe assumption that if bears are eating oil-tainted food they
are not going to be very well,'' he said. ``We've seen pictures of
dead deer in Prince William Sound that ate oil-tainted kelp, and it
looks like we could be seeing brown bear meeting the same fate.''
   Southwest winds forecast for Saturday were likely to push more
oil ashore, Quinley said. He said Exxon planned to send ships with
floating booms to try to protect nine sensitive coastal areas,
including Big River, from the oil.
   Quinley had no details on how much oil had washed ashore, and
Exxon's offices had closed by the time word came of the oil washing
ashore.
   Katmai is a mainland park west of the Kodiak group of islands.
Officials fear crab, salmon, herring, cod and pollock fisheries
thoughout the region may be destroyed by the spill.
   ``The coasts of Katmai and Kodiak have a lot of bird rookeries
and habitat,'' Quinley said, ``and they have numerous rich salmon
streams.''
   Much of the southern end of Kodiak Island makes up the Kodiak
National Wildlife Refuge and Kodiak Island is the home of the
largest concentration of brown bears in the world, Quinley said.
   Oil sheen also had rounded the tip of the Kenai Peninsula and
there were worries currents might carry it north toward Kachemak
Bay and fishing and tourism communities including Homer.
   Homer residents were building floating booms to protect their
shores. ``We were tired of sitting around doing nothing,'' said
Randy Holt, a carpenter. ``Now it's time to go to work.''
   Bruce Erickson, an environmental engineer for the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, said oil churned into a
thick mousse by waves was sighted at Shuyak Island, and an oil
sheen was off Afognak Island.
   The oil could threaten Kamishak Bay, a major herring fishery
norh of Cape Douglas, and the mouth of the McNeil River, which
feeds the bay, Quinley said. The river is a game sanctuary that
attracts photographers from around the world to take pictures of
brown bears feeding on salmon.
   Earlier reports had placed the oil only as far south as the
Barren Islands, the northernmost in the Kodiak archipelago and a
prime breeding habitat for seabirds.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the Department of Environmental
Conservation, said his department has been left on standby three
weeks after the 10.1 million-gallon spill. Officials are awaiting
Exxon's plan to clean 3,000 shore sites.
   ``No plan has been submitted,'' Kelso said. ``I do not think
there is a written plan.'' But Exxon said its plan was nearly
complete.
   ``We have been working to complete a comprehensive on-shore
cleanup plan with the various agencies and organizations involved
over the past three weeks to come up with the balance of clean-up
techniques with minimal environmental damage,'' the oil company
said in a statement.
   Gov. Steve Cowper and Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost returned
to survey the hundreds of miles of twisting, oily coastline. Yost
set a Saturday deadline for Exxon to produce a cleanup plan for the
spill, which officials said was not breaking up as fast as they had
hoped.
   Authorities said they probably would have to use high-pressure
hot water spray to cleanse many beaches, a controversial technique
because it kills organisms on and beneath the surface of the beach.
   ``This is a war,'' Yost said.
   ``Don't look for a miracle on beach-cleaning,'' he said. ``We
need hundreds of people, maybe multi-hundreds, maybe
multi-thousands.''
   Cowper, who arrived Friday wearing faded jeans and rubber boots,
said he was pleased Yost had taken over command of the cleanup.
   ``We were not satisfied with the way the operation was being
coordinated,'' he said. ``I think it's obvious that we, the state
and the Coast Guard, are not satisfied with the way Exxon has
performed.''
   Exxon had good intentions, he said, but ``good intentions and
good performance are two separate items.''
   Cowper led loud denunciations of Exxon by state officials last
week, threatening even to shut down the trans-Alaska oil pipeline.
But officials had been more muted this week until Kelso's latest
comments.
   ``We've been frustrated by the in-the-water cleanup. We don't
want to see that replicated on the shoreline,'' Kelso said, calling
Exxon's efforts ``entirely inadequate.''
   Added Yost: ``I'm not satisfied with the beach cleanup program.
I want a lot of people on the beach cleaning up.''
   Exxon officials did not respond to a request for comment.
   Earlier, officials had placed the lead section of the spill at
the Barren Islands, said Larry Dietrich, the director of
environmental quality for the Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   Recent storms broke up the slick less than officials hoped, he
said.
   ``We're concerned that it's holding together,'' Dietrich said.
``I don't think it's dispersing as well as people had hoped that it
might.''
   Thousands of sea birds and mammals have died in the oily muck,
and there are fears for the rich fisheries in Prince William Sound.
But damage has been greatest on the oiled beaches. Of the 3,000
separate cleanup areas on islands in Prince William Sound, 44 are
ready for cleanup crews, Kelso said.
   Workers are already at a few beaches, shoveling up oil, scraping
rocks and using low-pressure hoses to flush the oil back into the
water where it is trapped and recovered.
   A consensus is building to clean the shores with jets of
high-pressure hot water and steam, Dietrich said. But he said,
``It's going to be difficult to launch a cleanup effort on the
beaches until the floating product is removed.''
   The total oil recovered so far was about 9 percent of the spill,
or 882,000 gallons, Deitrich said, with some of the remaining
material having the consistency of asphalt.
   Cowper said it isn't known whether the steam-cleaning machines
will work in Alaska's rugged wilderness because fresh water was
used in previous operations, and crews in Prince William Sound will
be using salt water.

   Breeders, dealers and exotic animal
lovers flocked to a dairy barn to place their bids on everything
from emu and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs to zebu.
   About 1,000 exotic birds and animals were for sale at the
two-day auction that began Friday.
   ``It's a form of insanity,'' animal trader Jim Scott said of the
public's desire to own unique animals.
   Among the animals being auctioned were pygmy goats, cougars,
miniature donkeys, llamas, boa constrictors, bear cubs, blue-neck
ostriches and foxes.
   There were emu, which resemble ostriches, and zebu, domestic,
oxlike animals. You can even pick up a binturong, a catlike animal
from Asia, or a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig for about $10,000.
   Scott runs one of the largest exotic animal auctions in the
country in Cape Girardeau, Mo.
   Auction organizer Paul Ressler, who says his interest in exotic
animals began as a child, decided to begin his own auction when he
discovered the nearest place to buy exotic animals was in Missouri.
   His first auction in October brought in close to $45,000. He
said he expected this auction to generate more than $200,000.

<HEAD>Jury Apportions Blame For 1986 Crash That Killed 82 People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge and jury agreed that the Federal
Aviation Administration and the pilot of a small plane were equally
at fault for a 1986 collision of an Aeromexico jetliner and the
plane that killed 82 people.
   U.S. District Judge David V. Kenyon's decision Friday absolved
Aeromexico from any responsibility in the crash.
   ``I think when you weigh all of the possibilities, the jury has
recommended a number which is as fair and reasonable as any figure
could possibly be,'' he said of the 50-50 division of
responsibility.
   ``The FAA was negligent simply by its omission to warn the
Aeromexico plane,'' said Kenyon.
   The judge said he was unable to determine whether the traffic
controller, Walter White, saw a blip on the radar screen indicating
the small plane. White has said he didn't see it.
   Of William Kramer, the private pilot who was held 50 percent
liable for the crash, Kenyon said: ``It was simply a matter of a
caring, diligent man, who did not have enough flying time, flying
in what is probably one of the most difficult areas in the world to
fly. ... The situation simply got away from him.''
   The collision occurred in clear skies on Aug. 31, 1986, as the
Aeromexico DC-9, with 64 people aboard, was approaching Los Angeles
International Airport from the east at 6,500 feet.
   Kramer, 53, with his wife and a daughter as passengers, was
flying a single-engine Piper that slammed into the jet's tail and
sent both aircraft plunging into the ground. All aboard both planes
and 15 people on the ground in suburban Cerritos were killed.
   A National Transportation Safety Board report said an air
traffic controller's failure to see the small plane on his screen
and warn the airline were factors in the accident.
   The jury spent five months hearing testimony and deliberated for
46 hours over 10 days. The jury's ruling Friday was binding on the
estate of Kramer, but advisory on Aeromexico and the FAA.
   Damages will be decided at later trials or by settlement.
   The ability of the Kramer estate to pay damages is limited to
$1.2 million from an aviation insurance policy.
   The U.S. Justice Department attorney who tried the case, Steven
Riegel, acknowledged that the government probably will wind up
paying the majority of damages. Attorneys have said total damages
could range from $50 million to $100 million.
   ``We are disappointed that the FAA was found liable for 50
percent,'' Riegel said. ``We are reviewing the possibility of
appeal.''
   He said the air controller, White, has been promoted to an FAA
supervisor and is working ``at a control tower in another
location.''
   Attorney George Archer, representing the families of the airline
crew, relayed the comment of the mother of the jet's first officer,
Hector Valencia.
   ``We are all very happy and most grateful to the jury for
exonerating the pilots and the flight crew in this terrible
tragedy. God bless them all,'' she said in Mexico City.
   Attorneys Joseph T. Cook, representing survivor families, and
Franklin Silane, representing Aeromexico, said the verdict was not
an indictment of the air traffic control system.
   ```Overall, the traffic is safe in Los Angeles and the traffic
controllers are good at the job,'' Silane said. ``A mistake was
made on that day.''

<HEAD>Iranian Leader Sues Yugoslav Critics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
filed a criminal complaint against three Yugoslavs for criticizing
his order that author Salman Rushdie be killed for writing ``The
Satanic Verses,'' a newspaper reported.
   The complaint was filed with the Belgrade district attorney's
office under a section of the Yugoslav criminal code that forbids
``public humiliation'' of foreign countries or their leaders.
   Borba said Friday that the penalty for violating the law is up
to three years imprisonment.
   The newspaper said the complaint was filed against Stanislav
Marinkovic, editor of Borba; Vesna Roganovic, a journalist for the
paper, and Slobodan Selenic, a popular Yugoslav author.
   Selenic, head of the Yugoslav Writers' Union, was sued because
of a statement to Borba last month about ``Khomeini's frightening
threat'' against Rushdie, Borba said. Marinkovic and Roganovic were
cited for allowing the novel to be published, the newspaper said.
   A Yugoslav secretary who answered the telephone at the Iranian
Embassy said no one was available for comment. The holy month of
Ramadan began a week ago.
   Whether Khomeini will have his own day in a Yugoslav court was
not clear. Borba said several Yugoslav lawyers were representing
Khomeini.
   Parts of ``The Satanic Verses'' considered offensive to some
Moslems include a bordello scene in which prostitutes take the
names of Mohammed's wives, and the suggestion that the prophet
wrote the holy Koran instead of receiving it from Allah.
   The book has caused protests worldwide, and demonstrations over
its publication have led to the deaths of at least 19 people in
Pakistan and India. Two London bookstores in central London were
set afire Sunday in an apparent campaign of intimidation aimed at
stopping sales of the book.
   London detectives refused to say whether more threats of
violence have been received, but Scotland Yard said in a statement
Friday night: ``Last Sunday's incidents may be the start of a
campaign against premises which sell, publicize or make available
Salman Rushdie's novel `The Satanic Verses.'''
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old British citizen born in Bombay, India, to
Moslem parents, went into hiding after Khomeini issued his
execution order Feb. 14.

   Sharp cutbacks in this city's police
force and fire department because of budget problems have prompted
calls for the removal of Mayor Thomas Dunn, who has held office for
a quarter-century.
   About 250 police officers, firefighters and ambulance personnel
protested for a fourth straight day Friday, chanting on City Hall
steps, ``Dunn Must Go,'' and ``The roof, the roof, the roof's on
fire, let that ... burn.''
   Elizabeth, population 106,000, laid off 93 civilian employees,
70 police officers, 53 firefighters and 12 emergency medical
technicians at 6 p.m. Friday.
   The cuts mean a 22 percent reduction in the police force and 20
percent reduction in the fire department, along with the closing of
two firehouses and four of 11 fire companies, said Tony Valvano,
vice president of the Fireman's Mutual Benevolent Association in
Elizabeth.
   ``We've supported the mayor right down the line,'' Valvano said.
``We've done everything possible to help him but he's done nothing
to help us.''
   Dunn's term is up in 1992. The Democrat postponed for 45 days
the layoffs of 169 other employees scheduled to lose their jobs.
   The mayor has blamed Assembly Speaker Chuck Hardwick of Union
for the city's budget shortfall. Hardwick, a Republican
gubernatorial candidate, said a funding source is needed before he
would allow an Assembly vote to bring money to distressed cities.
   Hardwick criticized Dunn, calling the layoffs ``a shameful
political stunt that unnecessarily jeopardizes public safety.''
   Dunn called Hardwick ``hard-headed,'' and blamed the budget
problems on garbage disposal costs for the city adjacent to New
York's Staten Island. Costs have tripled in the last year because
of environmental laws that force the city to ship its trash out of
state.
   Elizabeth received $7.1 million from the state's aid to
distressed cities program, a 30 percent cut from last year. It had
requested $33.7 million.
   Valvano said the police and firefighters blame Hardwick, but
think Dunn is overreacting to the budget problems.
   ``The money is there, but he's just not using it,'' Valvano
said. ``We're not saying the city isn't in a fiscal crisis, it
probably is. But this doesn't have to happen right now. We feel
like Mayor Dunn has jumped the gun.''
   The City Council earlier this week approved a measure to
transfer funds earmarked for garbage disposal costs to pay the
employees for at least another month. Dunn rejected the move,
saying it broke state law.

   One out of every three pregnancies in China ends
in abortion, and 32 million abortions were carried out from 1985 to
1987, an official daily said today.
   The English-language China Daily, quoting earlier reports in the
Chinese press, also said 80 percent of abortions were requested by
women who did not know how to use contraceptives or whose
contraceptive methods failed.
   The daily said 70 percent of Chinese women of child-bearing age
use contraception, but 56 million do not.
   The report came out one day after China marked the birth of its
1.1 billionth citizen. The government has used the new population
figure to warn that the nation's family planning policies are being
ignored and China faces severe food and housing shortages if
population growth is not controlled.
   China denies foreign charges of forced abortions for women who
violate the one child per family policy or become pregnant without
authorization from their local family planning office.
   Last year the State Planning Commission said there were 10.39
million abortions in 1987, or 46 for every 100 live births. In the
United States, the abortion rate is approximately one for every
three live births.
   The daily said that of all contraceptive users, 40 percent are
women using intrauterine devices and 38 percent are women who have
been sterilized. Another 11 percent are men who have had
vasectomies, 5 percent are women taking contraceptive pills and 3
percent are men who use condoms.
   Chinese-made IUDs are reportedly of low quality, and the report
said 40 percent of women who use IUDS get pregnant.

<TEXT>
   The Marxist mayor of Sao Paulo is
battling one of Brazil's richest families in a drive to turn its
mansion, a symbol of Brazilian excess, into a workers' museum.
   Mayor Luiza Erundina signed an order Tuesday to expropriate the
huge neo-classical mansion of the Matarazzo family, believed to be
Brazil's most valuable private piece of urban real estate _ worth
an estimated $120-150 million.
   The mayor, a member of the socialist-oriented Workers Party,
said she wants to convert the mansion into a Workers' Museum and
Cultural Center.
   But a lawyer for the Matarazzos said the family would fight the
decision ``to the end.''
   The 47,000-square-foot white stone mansion, with vast gardens
and servants quarters in the rear, sits on a 3-acre wooded lot on
Avenida Paulista, in the heart of Brazil's most important financial
center.
   The house was built in 1941 by Count Francesco Matarazzo, an
Italian immigrant who became an industrialist and one of the
country's richest men. It was designed by Marcello Piacentini, the
official architect of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini.
   Today, surrounded by skyscrapers and fast-food restaurants, the
Matarazzo mansion is a reminder of a bygone age, when Avenida
Paulista was lined by elegant estates belonging to the cream of Sao
Paulo society.
   The count's heirs want to demolish the house and sell the
property, but they can't if the government expropriates it.
   The mayor's chief of staff, Jose Eduardo Cardoso, said in a
telephone interview that, ``We have only just begun the
expropriation process, and according to law we have five years to
conclude it. If by 1994 the expropriation is not completed it can
no longer be carried out.''
   Cardoso said the Matarazzo property is valued at $120-150
million, ``which we will have to pay to finalize the
expropriation.''
   He said the city will try to get funds from private companies to
pay for the expropriation, ``because obviously the municipal
government does not have the money for this kind of thing.''
   Matarazzo lawyer Magalhaes said the money could ``pay for at
least 30,000 low income houses, or 10 large hospitals or hundreds
of day care centers, endeavors which would be much more in line
with a government that claims to be concerned with the well-being
of the poor.''
   After her election last Nov. 15, Erundina said she would change
the priorities of past city governments and concentrate on health,
housing and educational projects for the poor.

   Vietnamese courts have convicted
several officials of corruption so widespread it forced the
dissolution of a state-owned firm and created millions of dollars
in foreign debt, Vietnamese radio reported.
   The Criminal Court and the Supreme People's Court of Minh Hai,
the country's southernmost province, convicted Duong Van Ba and his
accomplices Friday, official Radio Hanoi reported. A text of the
broadcast was seen in Bangkok today.
   The broadcast said that after many years of working at SIMOSCON,
the province's major trading firm, Ba and his accomplices ``abused
their power to violate the economic management policy, offered and
took bribes and trafficked in contraband goods.''
   It said their crimes ``disrupted such a large organization as
the SIMOSCON corporation to the point where it had to be dissolved.
His gang corrupted many cadres.
   ``More seriously, Duong Van Ba and his accomplices
misappropriated or caused the loss of state property amounting to
hundreds of millions of dong and creating a foreign debt totaling
millions of U.S. dollars.''
   Vietnamese authorities have giving high priority to combating
what they admit is widespread corruption among officials. The
campaign has been spearheaded by Nguyen Van Linh, who became chief
of the ruling Communist Party in late 1986 and immediately set out
to reform a party and state bureaucracy corrupted by years of
excessive centralized control and privilege.

   Authorities feared for the missing
young daughters of a winery worker suspected of killing his wife,
three of her relatives and a co-worker in a bloody rampage.
   Police searched for Ramon Salcido, 28, who fled with the three
girls after going on the shooting, battering and stabbing spree in
northern California's wine-making region on Friday, Sonoma County
Sheriff Richard Michaelsen said.
   The savage attacks on Salcido's two sisters-in-law, 8 and 12, in
which both were sexually assaulted and one was nearly decapitated,
heightened fears for his daughters, who vanished from the house
where his wife was slain.
   ``(Salcido) has the three children with him ... and that's
scary,'' Michaelsen said. ``He may have literally no attachment to
his own children at this point. We feel they are in great danger.''
   A neighbor who described himself as Salcido's best friend also
feared for the girls' lives.
   ``He already killed his wife, and he don't care anymore,'' said
Richard Clark.
   ``He's crazy, he was always going around with a gun,'' said
Clark, a 27-year-old self-employed mechanic who said he ``could see
it coming.''
   ``One time he threatened to blow (his wife's) head off,'' said
Clark, who has known Salcido for about four years.
   Police issued an all-points bulletin and used helicopters to
search for Salcido after the attacks in an area 60 miles north of
San Francisco.
   ``To go from one crime scene to the next, to see this beautiful
young wife. ... It was incredible,'' Michaelsen said. ``Then to go
... and see what he did to those little girls.''
   On March 11, a Superior court judge in Fresno County about 250
miles to the south ordered Salcido to pay his ex-wife, Debra Ann
Salcido, $511 a month in child support for their 4-year-old
daughter, Maria Crystal Garcia.
   Salcido was told of the order on Tuesday, but Michaelsen
declined to speculate whether it might have been what pushed
Salcido _ described as an insecure, jealous man enamored of guns _
over the edge.
   Authorities, meanwhile, described Salcido as ``extremely
dangerous.'' They said a witness saw him leave one of the places
where slayings occurred with several firearms and knives.
   They also alerted border police for fear that Salcido may be
heading for his native Mexico.
   Salcido's battered brown Ford sedan, in which he is believed to
have fled, was found Friday evening in San Rafael in neighboring
Marin County, about 25 miles south of where the attacks occurred,
the Sonoma County Sheriff's Department said.
   But there was no sign of the suspect or the three girls _
2-year-old Teresa, 3-year-old Carmina and 4-year-old Sofia.
   Authorities also were looking for a second car Salcido might be
driving.
   Michaelsen said investigators still were trying to determine the
bloody sequence of events, which occurred in four locations between
7 a.m. and 10 a.m.
   Salcido went to a Glen Ellen ranch and allegedly wounded Kenneth
Butti, 33, in the right shoulder, police said. Butti lived at the
ranch but worked with Salcido at the Grand Cru winery in nearby
Kenwood. Butti alerted police then was treated at Santa Rosa
Memorial Hospital.
   Authorities said Salcido, a Grand Cru forklift operator, also
went the winery, where he fatally shot assistant winemaker Tracey
Toovey, who was sitting in his car in the winery driveway. Toovey
was shot several times in the head.
   Michaelsen said Salcido also killed his wife, Angela, 24, at
their home in Boyes Hot Springs. Although the cause of her death
was unclear, Michaelsen said she apparently died of a ``very
traumatic injury'' and there was ``a considerable amount of blood
in the home.''
   Salcido also went to the Cotati home of his in-laws, Robert and
Marion Louise Richards.
   Robert Richards was at work when Salcido arrived, but Mrs.
Richards and their two daughters, Marie Ann Richards, 8, and Ruth
Richards, 12, were at home. All three were savagely attacked and
found dead in three blood-splattered rooms.

   Showers and thunderstorms extended across much of Florida today,
while a dense fog advisory was posted in Louisiana.
   An upper air disturbance over the southeast United States
produced showers and some thunderstorms Friday from the eastern
half of the Gulf Coast into the Tennessee Valley, parts of the Ohio
Valley, Virginia and the North Carolina coast.
   A narrow band of showers and thunderstorms were along a cold
front that stretched from the eastern half of the upper Great Lakes
to the Texas Panhandle.
   Clear skies and lower temperatures were behind the front, over
the northern and central Plains.
   Fog covered much of the lower Mississippi Valley and the western
half of the Gulf Coast. Some of the fog was dense with visibilities
that dropped as a low as a sixteenth of a mile at Baton Rouge, La.
   A dense fog advisory was in effect until midmorning for
east-central Louisiana.
   Today's forecast: showers and thunderstorms from the eastern
half of the Gulf Coast region across northern and central Florida,
the Tennessee Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast; showers from
the Virginias across New England and the lower Great Lakes; winds
strong and gusty from the upper Mississippi Valley across the
northern Plains into the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were to reach the 40s and 50s from the
northern Atlantic Coast across the northern Ohio Valley to the
Great Lakes states; the 60s and 70s along the Virginia and the
southern Atlantic coasts, the southern Ohio Valley, the central
Gulf Coast states, the Mississippi Valley, much of the Plains, the
northern and central Rockies, and much of the Pacific Coast; the
80s in southwest Texas, the southern Rockies, much of the southern
Plateau and the inland California; and the 90s across the desert
Southwest.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 24
degrees at Custer, S.D., to 78 at Phoenix and Miami.

<HEAD>Taiwan Calls For Two Governments, One China</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says it may scrap its
40-year vow to reconquer mainland China if Beijing recognizes
Nationalist sovereignty over Taiwan.
   Justice Minister Hsiao Tien-tzang told the Legislative Yuan on
Friday that China must approve a ``one China, two governments''
formula being promoted by the Nationalists to help the eventual
reunification of the mainland and Taiwan.
   ``Whether we continue to fight the Communist rebels depends on
the response from the other side of the Taiwan Straits,'' Hsiao
said, according to a statement issued today by the assembly.
   Taiwan newspapers, in dispatches from Tokyo, said Chinese
Premier Li Peng, who is visiting Japan, rejected the Nationalists'
suggestion on Friday because it would require Beijing to drop its
one-China policy.
   The decree calling for the reconquering of the mainland was
imposed in 1949 after the Nationalists lost a civil war on the
mainland and fled to Taiwan.
   Hsiao's statement was in reply to demands by Huang Huang-hsiung,
a member of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party, to abolish
the emergency decree.
   Huang said the Nationalist government ``has in fact recognized
Communist Chinese sovereignty over the people on the mainland'' by
pursuing a more flexible policy toward China since last year.
   For the past four decades, both the Nationalists and Communists
have maintained that Taiwan is a Chinese province and that
reunification will come under one government.
   In 1987, the Nationalists ended 38 years of martial law to allow
the formation of new opposition parties, but they retained the
emergency decree.
   As part of its flexible policy, Taiwan announced last week that
it will send an official delegation to China for the first time to
attend the annual meeting of the Asian Development Bank that begins
in Beijing on May 4.
   But it said the decision did not signal a change in its
anti-communist policy, and members of the delegation would not
discuss relations between the rival governments.
   The 12-member delegation is to be headed by Finance Minister
Shirley Kuo but will include Foreign Ministry officials.
   Government officials said Foreign Ministry representatives were
included to handle ``possible protocol problems'' and would not be
involved in diplomatic meetings with the Chinese.

<DATELINE>MATAMOROS, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seven of 13 mutilated victims of a
drug-smuggling cult have been identified, some by relatives who
traveled hundreds of miles to Matamoros funeral homes on the awful
chance their loved one was there.
   Meantime, U.S. federal charges were filed Friday against eight
suspects in the killings, including the man and woman alleged to be
the sect's masterminds.
   Four men in custody in Matamoros will be charged formally under
Mexican law Monday, said Jose Piedad Silva Arroyo, Mexico's federal
supervisor for narcotics investigations in Matamoros.
   Silva Arroyo said charges would include murder, drug offenses,
kidnapping and weapons possession.
   More than 60 people have visited El Rosario funeral home,
searching for missing relatives.
   ``From all over the country families have been coming here.
They're still coming,'' said Hector Olvera Garcia, a funeral home
worker.
   At Funerales Glayosso, another Matamoros funeral home, Maria del
Rosario Rivas Diaz of Monterrey, Mexico, identified the body of her
23-year-old son, Ernesto. He had been missing since Feb. 14.
   ``I think he suffered alive because they cut off his genitals,
cut off his ears,'' Mrs. Rivas Diaz said. ``He doesn't have any
eyes. He doesn't have a nose. He doesn't have any hair. Then I
think they killed him.''
   She said she identified him mainly by a cross tattooed on his
hand and by a missing front tooth. Ernesto's wife is three months
pregnant, said the grieving mother, who carried a picture of the
couple at their November wedding.
   Twelve bodies were exhumed Tuesday and a 13th Thursday at the
Santa Elena Ranch 20 miles west of this border city, following
confessions from the four suspects. The suspects say 14 people were
killed.
   Police said most of the cult's victims died either from blows
dealt with a machete or a hammer. Some suffered horrible
mutilations, including the removal of brains, hearts and other
organs that were boiled with blood in what suspects have described
as sacrificial rites of a cult seeking magical protection for their
drug-smuggling activities.
   Authorities said the gang smuggled a ton of marijuana weekly
into the United States. The four suspects in custody, the two
alleged masterminds and two newly identified suspects were charged
by the U.S. federal government Friday with conspiracy and drug
smuggling and possession.
   U.S. federal charges of unlawful flight to avoid prosecution
were filed against Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, nicknamed ``the
godfather,'' and Sara Maria Aldrete, 24, ``the godmother,''
officials said. The two were believed to be at large in the United
States.
   Also at large were Olvidio Hernandez Rivera, 26; and Alvaro de
Leon, in his early 20s.
   From her home in Miami, Delia Del Valle, Constanzo's mother,
told a Dallas television station through a translator Friday night
she is scared and confused in the wake of the slayings. But she
said she doesn't believe her son will call her because he wouldn't
want law enforcement officials to hound her.
   ``I can't believe it. He's my son,'' she said. ``I raised him. I
held him in my arms. He's always been beside me. He's not the kind
of son to disappear.''
   The body of Mark Kilroy, a 21-year-old University of Texas
student, was returned to the United States on Thursday, officials
said. His family returned to their hometown, Santa Fe, where a
funeral mass is planned for today.
   The other identified victims were Jose Luis Garcia Luna, 14, of
Matamoros; Valente del Fierro Gonzalez, 35, Matamoros; Victor
Sauceda Galvan, 22, of Matamoros; Ruben Vela Garza, 30, of La
Pesca, Mexico; Gilberto Garza Sosa, 37, of Matamoros; and Rivas
Diaz.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Won't Block Seabrook Tests, Approves Funding Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL MOKRZYCKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a boost to the Seabrook nuclear power
plant, a federal bankruptcy judge refused to block low-power
testing of the reactor and approved a settlement that ensures
funding until the end of the year.
   ``It is likely that Seabrook is ultimately going to go into
commercial operation,'' said Judge James Yacos on Friday in a
reorganization hearing of the Public Service Co. of New Hampshire,
Seabrook's lead owner.
   Yacos' rulings helped increase that likelihood by removing some
financial uncertainty about the $5.9 billion project.
   A Seabrook foe disputed Yacos' prediction, saying he based it
only on testimony from Public Service and its creditors. The
creditors stand to fare far better in the utility's reorganization
if the reactor operates, and none of them opposed prompt low-power
testing or the plant funding deal.
   ``You've got a record made on that solely by parties who have an
interest in taking an optimistic view of (Seabrook's prospects) _
who by the way don't have a very good track record in their
predictions,'' Robert Backus, lawyer for ratepayers' and
anti-nuclear groups, told Yacos.
   Seabrook, which was completed in July 1986 but remains stalled
by evacuation planning and financial problems, originally was
planned for commercial operation in 1979.
   Yacos replied, ``I deal with what I hear in this court. It may
or may not be reality, but that's what I deal with.''
   The judge acknowledged that there still are questions about how
a Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing board will rule on
remaining Seabrook issues and how appeals of those rulings will
fare.
   He said further Seabrook delays only would hamper efforts to
reach an agreement on a Public Service reorganization plan. Public
Service's Seabrook investment represents more than two-thirds of
its assets.
   ``This is simply another matter of leaning toward getting a plan
before the court for confirmation,'' the judge said of his rulings.
   Backus had tried to dissuade Yacos from approving an agreement
reached Thursday by state officials, Public Service and its
creditors ensuring that New Hampshire ratepayers won't be charged
for cleaning up Seabrook if it conducts the atomic tests but does
not operate commercially. Before the agreement was reached, state
officials had asked Yacos to delay the tests until commercial
operation is assured.
   Yacos said that if the creditors decide to take the risk paying
the cleanup costs if Seabrook never runs commercially, he will let
them.
   The owners are still struggling to prove to the NRC they will
cover the cleanup costs, and as a result no prospective date has
been set for the low-power tests.
   Richard Tilton, lawyer for the stockholders, said stalling the
low-power tests would lead to a delay in Seabrook's commercial
operation, and that risk ``far outweighs the fairly insignificant
costs of this settlement.''

   A chartered Concorde supersonic jet that
lost part of its tail while on a round-the-world trip flew on today
to Perth from Sydney _ 24 hours behind schedule but without
incident.
   The Concorde with its 100 American passengers was cruising last
Wednesday at about 1,500 mph _ about twice the speed of sound _
from Christchurch, New Zealand, when a nine-foot chunk of the tail
ripped away. The jet landed safely in Sydney as scheduled despite
the scare.
   There were no problems on today's 1900-mile flight to Perth, on
Australia's west coast, an airline spokesman said.
   A team of three engineers and two air safety officers flew from
London to Sydney on Thursday to repair the luxury British Airways
aircraft. The cause of the incident is under investigation.
   The aircraft's three-week journey, hosted by American columnist
William F. Buckley Jr., began in London on April 1. Passengers paid
$39,000 each for the 38,000-mile journey.
   The Concorde's next destination is Colombo, Sri Lanka, then on
to Africa before returning to London.
   Organizers aim to set several commercial speed records during
the journey.

<HEAD>Basque Separatists Wound Two Guards, Disrupt Rail Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Civil Guards were in serious
condition today with injuries suffered in a car bomb explosion, the
latest in a series of recent attacks blamed on Basque separatists.
   The blast occurred late Friday in Pasajes, near San Sebastian's
port, as the guards drove by a car packed with explosives, said
Guipuzcoa Civil Gov. Jose Ramon Goni Tirapu.
   The guards were investigating a bomb threat telephoned by a man
who said he was speaking for ETA, the Basque terrorist group, when
the explosion occurred, he said. ETA is a Basque acronym for
homeland and liberty.
   Meanwhile, most rail service to the south and the east was
suspended today after an ETA threat on Wednesday that it planned to
set off bombs by midnight Saturday on rail lines linking Madrid
with Seville and Valencia.
   The state railway company RENFE transferred thousands of
passengers to buses outside Madrid for transit to southern Seville
and eastern Valencia, a spokesman for the railroad said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   ETA has claimed responsibility for killing more than 600 people
in its 21-year campaign to secure independence for the
three-province northern Basque region.
   On April 4, after breaking off peace talks with the government,
ETA announced it would return to terrorism and call off a
three-month moratorium on violence.
   On Wednesday, ETA gunmen shot to death a Civil Guardsman near
Bilbao and claimed responsibility for six bombs mailed to the
Madrid offices of two ministers, the office of a Basque region
official, a military school in the Pyrenees and a Basque apartment
building.
   Bomb experts defused four bombs but two others exploded,
seriously injuring a Basque gym teacher and an Army sergeant.
   In San Sebastian, Tirapu said ETA members had packed the car
with about 66 pounds of explosives. The San Sebastian Red Cross
Hospital said the injured guards, Andres Sanchez Garcia, 38, and
Matias Martinez Silva, 26, were in serious condition with shrapnel
wounds.

   Track star Zola Budd, her
controversial running career on hold, today married a South African
liquor store owner in her hometown of Bloemfontein.
   Budd, 22, wed 26-year-old Mike Pieterse at the Universitas Dutch
Reformed Church in a ceremony attended by about 150 people.
   The two have known each other for about four years and were
engaged last August after Budd suspended her track career in
Britain and returned to Bloemfontein, about 240 miles southwest of
Johannesburg.
   Budd has been one of the world's top women distance runners in
recent years, winning two world cross-country championships and
setting world marks at three distances.
   But her career has been dogged by controversy since she was
hurriedly granted a British passport and allowed to compete at the
1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. South Africa is barred from
international competition because of its apartheid policies of
racial segregation.
   Anti-apartheid groups have criticized her relentlessly, saying
she should not be allowed to compete internationally because of her
South African connections.
   When she left Britain last May, her coach John Bryant said she
was suffering from ``complete mental exhaustion.''
   Since then, Budd has expressed an interest in resuming her track
career in Britain.
   British track officials said last month that Budd may be allowed
compete for Britain in the future if she lives permanently in that
country and stops spending lengthy periods of time in South Africa.

   Hu Yaobang, the former head of China's Communist
Party who was swept from power in a 1987 purge, died today after a
heart attack, the official Xinhua News Agency said. He was 73.
   Despite frequent rumors that Hu would make a comeback with the
help of his former mentor Deng, Hu has been the forgotten man of
Chinese politics since his ouster.
   Hu was last seen in public at the annual session of China's
parliament, which concluded April 4.
   Hu became head of the 47 million-member Communist Party in 1980.
Together with Deng and then-Premier Zhao Ziyang, he was
instrumental in initiating the market-style reforms that have
brought prosperity to millions of Chinese.
   Hu's outspoken manner led to his persecution during the 1966-76
Cultural Revolution and may in the end have alienated Deng to the
point where he authorized Hu's 1987 ``resignation.''
   Hu stepped down after taking the blame for pro-democracy student
demonstrations that swept the nation in December 1986. Hu was
allowed to retain his seat in the 17-member Politburo, the main
decision-making body in the party.

   Philip J. Furlong, the oldest Roman Catholic
bishop in the United States, died Thursday at the age of 96.
   Furlong was ordained in 1918. He became president of Cathedral
College in 1938 and held that post until 1941.
   In 1941, Furlong was named monsignor with the title of papal
chamberlain. In 1945, he was named a domestic prelate and was made
secretary of education for the Archdiocese of New York.
   Five years later, he became pastor of St. Thomas More parish in
Manhattan, and was elevated to prothonotary apostolic. In 1956, he
was ordained an auxiliary bishop. He remained as pastor of St.
Thomas More and an auxiliary to the military vicar until his
retirement in 1969.
   Furlong also served as national Catholic chaplain of the Civil
Air Patrol from 1942 to 1945 and national chaplain for the Girl

   The Congress of People's Deputies, the Soviet
Union's new parliamentary body, will go into session for the first
time on May 25, the Tass news agency said today.
   Tass said the date was announced in a decree of the Supreme
Soviet that was signed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The congress must meet within two months of being elected.
   Nationwide multicandidate elections for 1,500 seats in the
congress were held March 26, and run-off elections were held on
April 9.
   But 199 of those seats remain unfilled. In those districts only
one or two candidates ran March 26 and voters refused to give
either of them a majority.
   New elections are being organized and balloting will take place
May 14 in those districts.
   Voters rejected dozens of top-ranking Communist Party and
government officials in the first nationwide multicandidate
balloting in 70 years.
   Another 750 members of the congress are being chosen from the
party, its affiliates, and social and professional organizations.
   The 2,250-deputy Congress will meet once a year. It will choose
the Soviet president and from among its members a new, more
powerful Supreme Soviet.

   ``Ask yourselves if you have any justification for what you have

St. Peter's Catholic Church.
   Loudspeakers were set up outside to accommodate the overflow

   Miss Reilly was killed by the explosion of a car bomb on
Wednesday outside the police station in this port town in County
Down. The IRA, a mainly Roman Catholic organization fighting
British rule in the province, delivered four warnings _ all of them
after the explosion.
   The organization later expressed its ``sincere apologies'' for
killing Miss Reilly, who worked in a shop near the police station.
Thirty people, including six policemen, were also injured.
   On Friday night, hundreds of Catholics and Protestants attended
a special interdenominational rally in Warrenpoint to protest the
killing and the continuing campaign of terror.
   Miss Reilly was the 23rd person killed this year in sectarian
violence in the province.

<TEXT>
   A French naval vessel evacuated wounded
from Christian east Beirut today and brought medicine to the
besieged sector, but Moslem leaders disagreed on whether to accept
the humanitarian aid.
   Syrian and Christian gunners dueled intermittently with mortars
and rockets in and around Beirut before dawn. Police said two
people, including a Christian lawmaker, were killed and four people
were wounded during the shelling of the once fashionable
neighborhood of Ashrafiyeh.
   Police identified the dead parliamentary member as 72-year-old
Abu Sharaf, a Maronite. He represented the Christian Kesrouan
province in Lebanon's unicameral parliament.
   ``A rocket slammed into Ashrafiyeh. Deputy Abu Sharaf rushed to
the balcony after hearing screams for help. Then a second rocket
exploded in the same area. Shrapnel cut through his neck, killing
him instantly,'' a police report said.
   The latest casualties raised the overall toll to 217 dead and
731 wounded in the six-week battle, the latest in the nation's
14-year civil war.
   Police said a Lebanese navy gunboat during the night ferried 14
badly wounded Christians to the La Rance, a French navy support
ship with extensive hospital facilities, from the Christian port of
Jounieh.
   A police spokesman said the vessel had dropped anchor in
Lebanese territorial waters 10 miles off Jounieh.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with standing rules,
said most of the wounded were suffering from ``severe burns. They
were hit during the Syrian shelling (in previous fighting).''
   Some of the wounded will be treated aboard the French ship, but
difficult cases will be flown to France via Cyprus, officials have
said.
   The police spokesman said France's minister for humanitarian
assistance, Bernard Kouchner, supervised the operation from the
port. France has strong ties with Lebanon, which it ruled from
World War I until 1943.
   The spokesman said the gunboat brought medicine back from the La
Rance for hospitals in the 310-square-mile enclave that is home to
about 1 million Christians who are under fire from Syrian and
allied forces.
   A Moslem official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Kouchner was trying to persuade acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
who heads the Moslem cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, to allow
a similar evacuation of wounded Moslems from Syrian-policed west
Beirut.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, had welcomed the French humanitarian aid.
   But Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, the public works minister in
Hoss' cabinet, is opposed to the French assistance, the official
said.
   He said Jumblatt wants the La Rance and the French oil tanker
Penhors to anchor at a port his party's militia runs in Jiyeh, 15
miles south of Beirut, to violate a blockade imposed by Gen. Michel
Aoun on militia-run ports.
   The Penhors is carrying a shipment of fuel oil badly needed by
power stations in Lebanon to keep them running.
   Aoun's blockade of the port in early March started the latest
round of fighting between his 20,000 Christian troops and the Druse
militias. The Syrians later joined the fighting on the Druse side.
The militia ports deflect an estimated $100 million in levies
collected annually by the government.

   President Bush will go home from a NATO summit
in June without stopping in Lockerbie, Scotland, where a Pan Am
jumbo jet crashed after a bomb exploded on board last December.
   The White House announcement on Friday reverses a plan announced
the previous day by administration officials.
   The officials had said Thursday that Bush would visit Lockerbie
to thank the people there for pitching in on the search and
recovery effort for victims of the tragedy.
   However, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said
Friday it was decided Bush would not go.
   ``It was an idea. We couldn't work it in,'' he said.
   The stop was planned for early June on the way back from a NATO
summit in Brussels and visits to Italy, England and West Germany.
   ``It was just decided that at the end of the trip, we didn't
have time,'' Fitzwater said. He said the stop ``had some visual
appeal _ nice little town but it would have delayed us by a day and
a half.''
   The crash of Flight 103 last Dec. 21 killed all 259 people on
board and 11 on the ground.
   In Lockerbie, the Rev. James Annand said today, ``I don't think
anybody is unduly worried one way or the other.''
   ``It would have been very nice, but if he has other commitments
I don't think anybody is particularly upset. When we heard of the
possiblity, it was full of `ifs' and `maybes', anyway,'' said
Annand, a Church of Scotland minister.
   Sir Hector Monro, Conservative member of Parliament for the
area, said it was ``a bit of a disappointment.''
   ``It is all a bit of a mystery. Everybody began to look forward
to it and we will be disappointed now that it appears the visit is
off. There's not much more one can say,'' Munro said.

<HEAD>West Bankers Propose Partial Israeli Withdrawal, Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Palestinian leaders told Egypt they would
accept elections in Israeli-occupied territories under
international supervision and after a partial Israeli pullback, an
Egyptian government source said today.
   The proposal came from West Bankers led by Faisal Husseini, head
of the Arab Studies Center in East Jerusalem, who met with Foreign
Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid on Sunday, the source said.
   The proposals were ``ideas for consideration that do not amount
to a cut-and-dried plan,'' the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   They were a response to a peace plan proposed by Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir and unveiled on a trip to Washington
earlier this month, the source said.
   Shamir suggested Israeli-run elections be held in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip to choose representatives with whom Israel could
negotiate Palestinian autonomy.
   ``These local Palestinians are the people who are bearing the
brunt of the occupation. They are trying to help with ideas,
instead of rejecting things out of hand,'' the source said.
   PLO officials, who turned down the Shamir plan, indicated they
opposed the West Bankers' approach.
   Saeed Kamal, Cairo representative of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, denied that local Palestinians had offered any
proposals.
   ``This is a big lie,'' Kamal told The Associated Press.
   ``These so-called proposals are only ideas floated by Western
diplomats in Jerusalem. As far as the PLO is concerned, any
proposal involving elections can be made only in the U.S.-PLO
dialogue in Tunis,'' he said.
   Those talks began in the Tunisian capital in December after PLO
leader Yasser Arafat recognized Israel's right to exist, renounced
terrorism and accepted key U.N. resolutions on a Middle East
settlement.
   The Egyptian source said the West Bankers suggested a four-phase
plan.
   First, an international force would oversee withdrawal of
Israeli troops from populated areas in the occupied territories to
fringe positions.
   Polling then would be held under international supervision to
elect a parliament-in-exile. A delegation would be chosen from
among the parliament's members to negotiate interim self-rule with
the Israelis.
   In the final stage, the source said, the PLO and Israel would
negotiate autonomy for occupied territories at an international
conference.
   The PLO, however, demands that all Israeli forces leave the West
Bank and Gaza as a precursor to internationally-supervised
elections.
   At a meeting with President Bush last week, Shamir proposed his
plan for Israeli-overseen elections to choose Palestinians to
negotiate autonomy for the occupied territories.
   The Egyptian source said the Cairo government views the West
Bankers' ideas ``with an open mind. We have not taken any position
yet.''
   Since the uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza began in December 1987, more than 425 Palestinians and 18
Israelis have died.

<HEAD>Mubarak Names Powerful Defense Minister As Assistant President</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak today named Defense
Minister Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala, who helped develop Egypt's strong
ties with the United States, to fill the vacant post of assistant
president.
   The position of assistant president has been largely ceremonial.
But Field Marshal Abu-Ghazala is viewed as the second most powerful
man in the government, and his appointment could represent a
stepping stone to the position of vice president.
   The country has had no vice president since Mubarak succeeded
assassinated President Anwar Sadat in October 1981. Mubarak served
as vice president to Sadat from 1975 until the assassination.
   The Defense Ministry, which Abu-Ghazala headed for eight years,
will now be operated by Maj. Gen. Youssef Sabry Abu-Taleb, who ran
Cairo's government for six years as governor.
   Mubarak announced the two appointments in decrees and
immediately swore in the two men to their new posts. No explicit
reason for the changes were given.
   Afterward, Prime Minister Atef Sedki told reporters only that
Mubarak ``needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks
that he has to discharge.'' He said he does not expect further
Cabinet changes.
   The last assistant president was former Prime Minister Mamdouh
Salem. He died three years ago, and the position has been vacant
since then.
   In the last few years, there have been frequent reports and
speculation that Mubarak would appoint Abu-Ghazala as vice
president. Abu-Ghazala denied the reports.
   Abu-Ghazala, 59, served as military attache in Washington
between 1976 and 1979. He was regarded as a prime player in forging
Cairo's special relationship with the United States after Egypt
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   He was graduated from Cairo's Military Academy in 1949, but he
later attended military courses both in the Soviet Union and the
United States. He was an officer in Egypt's 1956, 1967 and 1973
wars with Israel.
   Abu-Taleb, 60, served longer as Cairo's governor than anybody
else since Egypt became a republic in 1952. He is widely regarded
as the best governor modern Cairo ever had.
   The Middle East News Agency said his successor is Mahmoud
Sherif, governor of Sharkia province.

   Hu Yaobang, the former head of China's Communist
Party who was swept from power in a dramatic 1987 purge, died of
heart failure today. He was 73.
   Hu died exactly one week after suffering a heart attack during a
meeting of the Politburo, the party body which oversaw his downfall
two years before, the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The reformer once stood on the threshold of succeeding Deng
Xiaoping as the leader of China's 1.1 billion people, but he fell
from grace over 1986 pro-democracy student demonstrations.
   In a statement read on national television, the Communist Party
Central Committee praised Hu as a ``long-tested loyal communist
fighter, great proletarian revolutionary, statesman'' and
outstanding leader.
   A photo of Hu trimmed in black appeared on the screen before and
after the announcement while somber music played for about a minute.
   National television showed a film of Hu's trip to western China
in the early 1980s when he revisited sites he passed through during
the 1934-35 Long March, the Red Army's epic flight from Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists.
   Xinhua carried a two-paragraph item with a short biography. The
People's Broadcasting Station mentioned his death in its regular
news briefs.
   Despite frequent rumors that Hu would make a comeback with the
help of his former mentor Deng, Hu has been the forgotten man of
Chinese politics since his ouster.
   Hu was last seen in public at the annual session of China's
parliament, the National People's Congress, which concluded April 4.
   Hu became head of the 47 million-member Communist Party in
February 1980. Together with Deng and then-Premier Zhao Ziyang, Hu
played an instrumental role in initiating the market-style economic
reforms that have brought prosperity to millions of Chinese.
   Hu, Deng's longtime bridge partner, was widely expected to take
over Deng's functions when China's senior leader, now 84, finally
stepped down.
   But he was always held in suspicion by China's conservative
factions, in part because of his blunt criticisms of Mao Tse-tung's
policies and his tendency to state his opinion without consulting
party members.
   In 1987 Hu stepped down as Communist Party secretary-general
after taking the blame for pro-democracy student demonstrations
that swept the nation in December 1986. He was allowed to retain
his seat in the 17-member Politburo.
   After Hu's ouster, Zhao moved over to take Hu's post as general
secretary of the party, and Li Peng, a technocrat with a more
cautious approach toward reform, was named premier.
   Hu was born in 1915 in Liuyang County, Hunan province, and,
according to official reports, left home at age 14 to join the
Communist Party Children's Corps.
   In 1952, three years after the communist takeover of the
mainland, he became secretary of the Communist Youth League and in
1956 joined the party Central Committee.
   In 1966, as head of the Youth League, he became a prime target
of Mao's Cultural Revolution. Red Guards shaved his head, forced
him to crawl on his hands and knees and sent him to rural Henan
province for 2{ years of exile.
   Among his alleged crimes was that he and Deng, another victim of
the leftists, used railroad cars and special airplanes to ferry
bridge partners around the country.
   After Henan, Hu underwent another two years of ``re-education''
and was under house arrest for five years. In 1975, he resurfaced
as an official of the Academy of Sciences, but in 1976 he was
branded a ``capitalist roader in the scientific front'' after
saying science and technology, not class struggle, is the
``locomotive of history.''
   In 1977, after the leftists were purged and Deng began his slow
rise to power, Hu took over as head of the party's Organization
Department, where he supervised the redress of frame-ups during the
Cultural Revolution.
   In 1980, he was elected secretary-general of the party Central
Committee, and served as chairman of the party, the post once held
by Mao, from 1981 until the title was abolished the next year. He
then became the party general secretary.
   In 1983, he revealed he had four children and five
grandchildren. His wife, Li Zhao, is a clothing designer and former
official in the Beijing Textile Bureau.

   Tamil militants today attacked Sri
Lankan troopers escorting Sinhalese laborers in a northeastern
jungle and killed at least 21 soldiers, military officials said.
   Also today, Sinhalese radicals detonated a remote-controlled
bomb under a Sri Lankan army truck, killing one soldier and
injuring three, a military official said. He blamed the attack near
Angunakolapelessa, 80 miles southeast of Colombo, on the People's
Liberation Front, a nationalist Sinhalese group.
   The attack in the northeastern jungle was the third blamed on
Tamil militants since Thursday. Authorities say at least 79 people
have died since Thursday despite a government cease-fire called in
an attempt to persuade Tamil rebels and Sinhalese militants to
surrender.
   At least four laborers were wounded in the jungle attack near
the village of Parakramapura in Weli Oya district, said officials,
who cannot be identified under briefing rules. At least 21 soldiers
were killed, they said.
   The village is about 150 miles northeast of Colombo.
   At least 45 people, many of them Sinhalese, died when a car bomb
exploded in the port city of Trincomalee on Thursday.
   On Friday, another car bomb exploded in the Tamil-dominated town
of Jaffna, 185 miles north of Colombo, leaving 12 people dead and
18 critically injured. Most of those killed and injured were Tamil
students, a military official said.
   ``We believe the bomb went off prematurely when passing the
university and was meant for Indian troops manning a small camp 75
yards away from the university,'' said one of the military
officials in Colombo.
   A leader of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the largest
Tamil guerrilla group that has been fighting the Sri Lankan
government and Indian peacekeeping troops, also said 12 people were
killed, mostly Tamil students.
   The Tiger leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity in
Colombo, said he did not know who was responsible for the bomb.
   Jaffna once was the chief stronghold of the Tigers, but the
separatist guerrillas' open presence in the town was halted by the
Indian force that was dispatched to Sri Lanka in July 1987 in an
effort to disarm the Tigers and enforce a India-Sri Lanka peace
pact.
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa's government on Wednesday
announced a one-week cease-fire in an effort to halt the bloodshed.
The president offered to talk with both Tamil and Sinhalese
radicals ``any time, any place.''
   The Tamil Tigers rejected the cease-fire. The People's
Liberation Front, in a statement to local newspapers, questioned
the government's sincerity.
   Tamil separatists launched their battle in 1983, attacking the
Sinhalese-dominated government's troops and Sinhalese civilians.
The Tigers rejected government efforts to pacify the Tamil
militants by offering them a measure of autonomy.
   The Sinhalese extremists began a campaign of assassinations,
saying the government offered too many concessions to the Tamil
minority.
   Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhists, comprise 75 percent of Sri
Lanka's 16 million people. Tamils, who are mostly Hindus, account
for 18 percent.
   More than 12,500 people, including at least 800 Indian soldiers,
have died in six years of warfare.

   Soldiers patrolling the Soviet Georgian capital
where 19 pro-independence protesters were killed nearly a week ago
were pelted with rocks and bottles, news reports said today.
   The Communist Party daily Pravda and the Defense Ministry
newspaper Red Star reported Tbilisi was calm during the day but
that tensions still rose nightly as the 11 p.m. curfew approached.
   However, Pravda suggested the 11 p.m.-6 a.m. curfew that was
imposed after Sunday's clash could end soon.
   The reports came after the southern republic's Communist Party
and government leaders were replaced following the killings by Red
Army troops who were trying to disperse nationalist protesters
Sunday.
   ``Nobody and nothing can justify the deaths of absolutely
innocent people,'' Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an
ethnic Georgian, said in a speech Friday to Georgia's party plenum,
which made the leadership changes.
   At a meeting in Moscow, a group of prominent intellectuals,
including human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov, today blamed
the clash in Tbilisi on Moscow bureaucrats who imposed stronger
security measures last year.
   Decrees approved at the end of July require advance permission
for meetings and demonstrations and gave a special force attached
to the Interior Ministry special power for keeping order at
demonstrations.
   Soviet officials are conducting an investigation to determine
whether security forces who broke up the demonstration in Tbilisi
killed people by beating them with shovels they had been issued to
dig trenches.
   The group said the killings in Georgia threaten President
Mikhail Gorbachev's reforms, known as perestroika.
   ``This is a knife pushed into the back of perestroika by
high-ranking bureaucrats, first and foremost, I believe, by the
Moscow ones,'' said one member of the group, economist Leonid
Batkin.
   Sakharov, a 1975 Nobel Peace Prize winner and Tribuna board
member, sat near Batkin but did not speak.
   Mourning Georgians continued piling fresh flowers at the site of
the clash Sunday outside the local government headquarters in
Tbilisi. More funerals in the Black Sea republic bordering Turkey
were scheduled today.
   Red Star reported new ``calls for people to commit terrorist
acts.''
   ``In a few regions, rocks and bottles have been thrown at
military vehicles during the night,'' the paper said.
   Shevardnadze, party chief in the southern republic from 1972 to
1985 and now a member of the ruling Politburo in Moscow, was
dispatched to Georgia after Sunday's bloodshed.
   Givi G. Gumbaridze, Georgia's KGB chief for two months, was
elected Friday by the party plenum to succeed Dzhumber I.
Patiashvili as party first secretary. Gumbaridze, 45, previously
served as party leader in Tbilisi, a city of 1.2 million people.
   Patiashvili, 49, who held his post since replacing Shevardnadze,
accepted responsibility for the clash and resigned.
   Premier Zurab Chkheidze also was removed at a separate meeting
of Georgia's Presidium, or top government body, the Tass news
agency reported. Nodari Chitanava, a Central Committee secretary,
was named the new head of the republic's government, Tass said.
   Patiashvili has said he did not expect fatalities when troops
were ordered to quell Sunday's protest.
   Signs posted at Tbilisi State University called Patiashvili a
``killer.''
   In shaking up their leadership, Georgian party officials were
following a pattern set last year in the neighboring republics of
Armenia and Azerbaijan. After four months of nationalist protests,
the Armenian and Azerbaijani party chiefs were fired, apparently
for their inability to halt unrest.
   In the Baltic republics to the north, residents in the Latvian
capital Riga and two other cities were startled this week by tanks
that thundered through the area on what military officials called
training exercises.
   Ten to 20 tanks were reported in Riga on Monday, five in the
Estonian city of Tartu on Thursday, and armored personnel carriers
were seen Friday in Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
   All three cities have had demonstrations drawing tens of
thousands of people demanding greater autonomy.

   A memorial erected anonymously at the site
of a bus crash that killed 27 people has been removed by the state
as a safety hazard.
   ``It's a real kick in the teeth to a whole group of people who
are still hurting,'' said the Rev. Don Tennison of the First
Assembly of God in the victims' hometown. ``I can't understand why
bureaucrats can't have more compassion.''
   Two crosses surrounded by colorful flowers appeared in the
median of Interstate 71 shortly after the accident last May, in
which a church bus collided head-on with a pickup truck going the
wrong way near Carrolton.
   Kenny French, head of the state Highway Department district
office in Covington, ordered the memorial removed late last month.
   Mark McDaniel, a spokesman for the Department of Transportation,
said a tractor-trailer driver complained of nearly rear-ending a
car that slowed to look at the memorial.
   ``Then we had others complaining of near misses, and people
parking on both shoulders of the highway and in the median, and
walking across the highway,'' McDaniel said. ``We were afraid
someone else would get killed.''
   ``We realize it's a very emotional situation, but what if
another family member was struck by a car there? We've got 27 dead
and we don't need 28 at the same location.''
   Tennison said the crosses were a ``testament that drinking and
driving do not mix.''
   Larry Mahoney, the alleged drunken driver of the pickup, is
awaiting trial on 27 charges of murder in the crash.
   The crosses and flowers will be given to those who erected them
if their identities are learned, officials said.

   A mural in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi was set
afire last week by demonstrators, and the now charred script
proclaims: ``Brotherhood throughout the U.S.S.R.''
   The message behind the mural has also been under fire recently,
not only in the southern republic of Georgia, but also in
neighboring Armenia and Azerbaijan, in the three Baltic republics,
and in the Ukraine and Moldavia.
   The latest nationalist demonstrations in Georgia, in which at
least 19 people were killed, have again demonstrated the ethnic
divisions of the Soviet Union and further eaten away at the cement
holding the country's more than 100 national groups together.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said relations between
national groups are his country's most serious problem.
   Ronald Suny, an American scholar specializing in Soviet national
relations, called the nationality problem the Kremlin's ``Achilles'
heel'' and identified Georgia as a potential powderkeg.
   In the past year, there have been demands for autonomy and even
independence by Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians and Moldavians.
Ethnic hatred between Armenians and Azerbaijanis claimed more than
90 lives.
   On April 4, some of Georgia's 5.3 million inhabitants _ fiercely
independent people whose native son, Josef Stalin, is both a source
of pride and shame _ began taking to the streets.
   Some demonstrators objected to a demand put forward March 18 by
an ethnic minority in western Georgia, the Abkhazians, to secede
from the republic. Others wanted independence for Georgia itself.
   Abkhazia is an autonomous republic under Georgian control with
505,000 residents, of whom just 15 percent, or 91,000, are ethnic
Abkhazians. They have contended they suffered an ``ethnic
catastrophe'' and should become a completely separate republic.
   The region's party chief, B.V. Adleiba, was fired after
endorsing the Abkhazian secession call.
   The Abkhazians had voiced the demand for years without success.
They may have been emboldened to try again because of reforms
instituted under Gorbachev and because of the partial victory of
residents of another autonomous republic, Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Residents of Nagorno-Karabakh, mostly ethnic Armenians, had been
under the control of Azerbaijan since 1923 but demanded in February
1988 that their region be allied with the Armenian republic.
   Azerbaijani leaders rejected the demand. Strikes, demonstrations
and bloody violence followed. The central government in Moscow
eventually put Nagorno-Karabakh under Kremlin control temporarily.
   A second issue behind the Tbilisi demonstration was a demand for
the entire Georgian republic to break away from the Soviet Union.
Some residents of the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Estonia and
Latvia also have called for secession, saying their
once-independence republics have suffered since being incorporated
into the Soviet Union in 1940.
   Georgia, smaller than South Carolina, also was once an
independent nation, in 1918-1921. But Russian troops were sent in
and it was absorbed into the Soviet Union.
   Under Soviet power, Georgians have thrived economically because
the area's warm climate is ideally suited for resorts and growing
the fruits and vegetables that are scarce elsewhere in the country.
   But under Leonid I. Brezhnev, ethnic mafias ran the republic.
Embezzlement, cronyism and bribery were widespread. Black
marketeering of farm produce was rampant.
   Before Gorbachev named him foreign minister in 1985, Eduard A.
Shevardnadze, an ethnic Georgian, served 13 years as the republic's
Communist Party chief, leading a tough anti-corruption drive.
   Gorbachev has sent Shevardnadze, his top diplomat, back to
Georgia to help cool tempers.
   Authorities tolerated the demonstrations outside the Georgian
government's offices in Tbilisi for four days, but when the number
of protesters reached an estimated 100,000 on April 7, tanks,
armored personnel carriers and special troops were sent in.
   Two days later, in the early morning darkness, soldiers charged
demonstrators, and at least 19 were killed by official count.
   The protests were planned to lead up to the anniversary of an
April 14, 1978 Tbilisi demonstration that succeeded in defeating
plans to drop Georgian as the republic's official language.
   Like many of the Soviet Union's nationalities, some Georgians
claim they are being ``Russified.'' Russian bureaucrats and
politicians in Moscow largely control local politics and economies
in the rest of the country.
   Suny, a history professor at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, told foreign reporters during a recent seminar in Moscow
that many of the country's ethnic groups have developed a feeling
of a ``nation in danger.''
   For much of the 71 years of Soviet power, especially under
Stalin's reign of terror, the ethnic groups kept silent. But
Gorbachev's policies of ``glasnost,'' or openness, and
``perestroika,'' or restructuring, have unleashed a torrent of
complaints from the national groups.
   ``Basic nationalities problems have been swept under the rug for
50 to 60 years. Now they're (authorities) paying for it,'' Suny
said.
   Gorbachev's liberalization has gone so far, he said, that the
demands of the Soviet Union's non-Russian population cannot be
limited. More Nagorno-Karabakhs are lurking under the surface, Suny
said. By his count, 40 ethnic territories in the Soviet Union could
be open to challenge.
   Gorbachev has shown some sympathy for ethnic activists, granting
their republics more leeway in decision-making. But as he did in
the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute, the Kremlin chief has rejected the
demands of Abkhazian and Georgian separatists.

   In a cramped apartment in grimy northern Beijing,
one of China's top fashion models donned a negligee Saturday to
pose for Hollywood photographer Douglas Kirkland.
   Chinese photographer Li Weishun set off in pursuit of pearl
divers and fishermen on the southeast coast.
   National Geographic photographer Stephanie Maze drove through
hundreds of miles of arid northern Chinese wasteland to photograph
cave-dwellers.
   A total of 89 photographers from a dozen countries trained their
lenses on Chinese factory workers, acrobats, duck farmers and
doctors in an effort to capture the many facets of ``A Day In The
Life Of China'' for a book of that name.
   The book will be the ninth in a series of ``Day In The Life
Books,'' which has included volumes on the United States, Japan and
the Soviet Union.
   David Cohen, president of Collins Publishers of San Francisco,
said the goal was to create a visual time capsule of the most
populous nation on earth.
   The photographers, including 28 Chinese, took up positions from
the Soviet border in the north to Friendship Pass on the southern
frontier with Vietnam. Some faced three-day trips by car, train and
boat to reach their destinations, said assignment coordinator Bill
Messing.
   They will bring back an estimated 120,000 pictures, of which
about 275 will be included in the book, said project spokeswoman
Patti Richards.
   Kirkland, who has photographed such Western stars as Marilyn
Monroe, went to work at the two-room family home of 19-year-old
model Peng Li, who won a modeling competition last year in Salerno,
Italy.
   ``Yes, yes, yes,'' he muttered to himself as he circled around
the calmly smiling Ms. Peng. Both were oblivious to a seven-member
Chinese television crew jammed in the apartment to photograph the
photographer.
   Cohen said negotiations with the Chinese government over the
project began in August. Approval came much quicker from Beijing
than from Moscow, which took three years to approve a book on the
Soviet Union that was photographed in 1987.
   ``In the Soviet Union there was a constant concern of what could
be shown,'' Cohen said. ``Here it was a question of money rather
than politics.'' Cohen said the Chinese refused to let a Western
photographer go to Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, which has been
closed to foreigners since March 8 under a martial law imposed to
quell anti-Chinese protests.
   They also refused permission to station a foreign photographer
at Friendship Pass on the Chinese-Vietnamese border, where the two
countries still have occasional small-scale clashes. A Chinese
photographer was assigned to both places, Cohen said.
   The book will be published in time for the 40th anniversary of
the founding of Communist China on Oct. 1.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Vanel, a craggy-faced actor with a piercing
gaze who appeared in more than 200 movies in his 76-year film
career, died today in a Cannes hospital. He was 96.
   Vanel was taken to the Sunny Bank Anglo-American Hospital in
Cannes on Friday night after complaining of weakness, friends said.
He died at 12:45 a.m. ``of his advanced age,'' the hospital said.
   During his film career, which began in 1912, he worked under
some of the industry's finest directors, including Alfred
Hitchcock, Luis Bunuel, Jacques Feyder and Henri-Georges Clouzot.
   Hitchcock in 1954 cast him as a policeman on the trail of Cary
Grant in ``To Catch a Thief.''
   The year before, he won the best actor prize at the Cannes Film
Festival for Clouzot's 1953 classic ``The Wages of Fear.''
   Vanel was born to a seafaring family in Rennes on Aug. 21, 1892.
He dreamed of becoming a naval officer, but problems with his eyes
forced him to give up the idea of going to sea.
   Moving to Paris with his family in 1904, he discovered the
theater and at 16 made his first appearance on stage in ``Hamlet.''
   His career spanned silent movies to television roles in the
1960s and 1970s. His last film was Jean-Pierre Mocky's ``The
Seasons of Pleasure'' in 1988.
   In an interview with a Swiss newspaper in 1986, Vanel said:
``You know, in our profession, there is no end. As long as one has
the strength to do it, you can act.''
   For the past 20 years, he lived in the south of France near
Cannes with his wife, Arlette.
   The funeral will be held Tuesday in village church at
Mouans-Sartoux, where Vanel lived. Burial will be in Nice.

<TEXT>
   With hardly a river anyone would swim
in and forests dead or dying of acid rain, it seems Europeans have
decided ecology is not just for leftists anymore.
   Heightened awareness has pushed the issue from the fringe to the
fore, lending more respectability and clout to the parties that
first made Mother Earth a candidate.
   Members of the once-radical Greens hold Parliament seats in West
Germany, Belgium, Italy and Austria. Berlin's governing coalition
includes Greens, and France's Greens, Les Verts, had surprising
success in municipal elections last month.
   Ecology parties hope to double their representation in the
European Parliament in elections June 18, and unofficial sister
parties of the Greens have sprung up in the Soviet bloc.
   Little unity is evident among the dozens of parties born of
concern for man's ravaging of the planet, but all benefit from
growing worry about pollutants in the air, water and food supplies.
   ``Environmental consciousness has for years been coming to the
forefront, and a number of environmental catastrophes have
accelerated this,'' said Ruth Hammerbacher, a 36-year-old
sociologist who is the moderate new leader of West Germany's Greens.
   Rhine River chemical spills, North Sea oil slicks and
radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear disaster finally
have moved Europeans to action on recycling and restraint, she said.
   A turn to the left among voters also has brightened the
political fortunes of some European Greens.
   But Greens parties differ widely by country and ``the result is
a painfully underdeveloped network of contacts and coordination,''
said Juergen Maier, who nurtures the Greens' fledgling
international relations.
   ``We have no world development plan,'' said Maier, a pragmatist
typical of today's mellower Greens. ``In most cases we had little
to do with the foundation of foreign Greens parties.''
   Ms. Hammerbacher attributes some of the environmentalist
parties' new prominence to ``the graying of the Greens,'' a
moderating with age that helps attract West German voters. The
party born in the student and anti-war groups of a generation ago
now is dominated by people pushing 40.
   The decision to play politics and build a more cohesive
international network earns the scorn of such Old Guard party
figures as Petra Kelly, who accuses the new leadership of
abandoning principles in an ``opportunist'' quest for power.
   Despite the new respectability, Greens parties still have
limited influence, often getting less than 5 percent of the vote in
national elections. They are strongest in West Germany, with 43,000
members and the support of 8-9 percent at the polls.
   Inter-Green relations are too informal for a joint strategy in
the European Parliament elections, but individual parties across
the continent seem to smell the same opportunity.
   British Greens secretary Sara Parkin told her party conference
this month she was ``wildly optimistic'' about the chances. For the
first time, Greens candidates are contesting all 78 British seats
in the 518-member legislature based in Strasbourg, France, which
determines policy and joint strategy on issues affecting the entire
continent, such as the environment.
   Getting into the British Parliament is tougher because of the
winner-take-all electoral system, which contrasts with the more
flexible proportional representation common on the continent.
   France's Parliament has no Greens, but Les Verts won 926 posts
in local and regional elections last month. Resentment of urban air
pollution is growing in France, and Les Verts focus solely on
environmental issues.
   In Italy, the Verdi party has been in Parliament less than two
years, but recent local elections show a steady increase in
support. Spokesman Gianluca Felicetti said it was ``the only party
with potential for a notable increase in votes'' for the European
Parliament.
   Austrian Greens spokesman Stefan Schennach estimated his party's
support at about 8 percent nationwide and predicted it would win 12
seats in the next parliamentary election. Seven of the current
Parliament's 183 members are Greens.
   Environmentalists have established Greens parties in Poland,
Hungary and the Soviet Union, but none has been granted official
status.
   West Germany's Greens, the originals, have the most impressive
record. They have gained respect after six years in the Bundestag,
or Parliament, despite occasional antics, and hold 43 of the 519
seats.
   ``Voters now see the possibility of getting Greens candidates
elected; they don't fear wasting their vote,'' said Helmut Lippelt,
a 57-year-old historian in the Greens delegation.
   The party's conduct in the Bundestag has changed over the years.
   Greens still knit occasionally during debates and the Parliament
president censured one recently for shouting accusations, but they
no longer let their guests lob paint-filled balloons at speakers.

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elk, bison and other
wildlife that survived a rough winter and a slaughter by hunters
are beginning to benefit from the fires that ravaged the world's
oldest national park last summer.
   As the snow melts over Yellowstone National Park's 2.2 million
acres, new vegetation is springing from soil enriched by nutrients
that were released by the burning.
   In addition, moose, antelope, mule deer, bears and other animals
will enjoy new summer grazing areas burned into previously dense
stands of lodgepole pine.
   ``The majority of the fire effects will be positive,'' said a
report last month by the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating
Committee, ``including increased production of grasses, forbs and
shrubs; higher protein content in forages; lower fiber content;
earlier spring green-up, and more diverse diets for elk.''
   Politicians have argued that the National Park Service and U.S.
Forest Service mismanaged the forest fires, which blackened nearly
half the park.
   But not all the emerging scenes in Yellowstone are picturesque.
Many hillsides and meadows are littered with the carcasses of elk
and bison that failed to survive the winter. By historical
standards the season was not harsh, but it was severe enough to
kill off many old animals that had survived the unusually mild
winters of the past decade.
   And when many elk and bison looking for forage trudged north
beyond the park's boundaries, hunters flocked into Gardiner, Mont.,
to shoot them. Montana officials worried the bison would infect
cattle with brucellosis, which causes cows to abort.
   By the end of this past winter's hunting seasons, Yellowstone
officials estimated 2,400 elk were taken along with 527 bison.
   The animals' deaths generated debate on the need for more winter
range for the animals north of Yellowstone and on the lack of
environmental logic used when the park was carved out of Wyoming,
Idaho and Montana 117 years ago.
   ``Park boundaries are drawn politically,'' said Stu Coleman,
Yellowstone's resource management specialist. ``That's why they're
so nice and straight. If in 1872 they had thought ecologically,
they probably would have stepped back, studied the situation and
drawn the boundaries ecologically.''
   Earlier this month the Greater Yellowstone Coordinating
Committee set a goal of raising $6.7 million to acquire 18,000
acres of private land north of the park.
   ``We don't bill it as, `This is the only solution,''' said
Yellowstone Superintendent Bob Barbee. But ``it would relieve the
problem.''

   Oliver North may have severely hurt his
credibility by telling jurors at his Iran-Contra trial he bought an
$8,000 used car with cash kept at home in a closet, legal experts
say.
   ``The most damaging thing that happened to him during the trial
was the cross-examination on the money. That was just
devastating,'' said Washington attorney John Nields, who was one of
North's interrogators at the 1987 congressional hearings when he
was chief counsel to the House Iran-Contra committee.
   Nields and three other lawyers interviewed after eight weeks of
trial testimony ended Friday said the cross-examination of North by
prosecutor John Keker may be damaging for the defense.
   Final arguments are to begin Tuesday and the case could go to
the jury by Thursday.
   One of the lawyers interviewed said the former National Security
Council aide might well be acquitted of the most serious charges,
including an allegation he pocketed money from Nicaraguan rebels.
   But all four agreed that North's assertion that he covered the
1985 car purchase from a $15,000 stash of money in a box bolted to
the closet floor was troublesome for the defense.
   ``To have come up with a locked box on the floor for your
explanation for large expenses when you are taking travelers checks
from your Contra kitty looks terrible,'' Nields said.
   ``It is fishy to have $15,000 in your closet, nobody does
that,'' said Paul Rothstein, a professor at Georgetown University
Law Center. ``I am not entirely convinced the jury is going to
think its smelly, it just depends on their personal experience.''
   Besides charges he lied about his secret help of the Nicaraguan
rebels, North is also accused of diverting to his personal use some
$4,300 of the $90,000 to $100,000 worth of travelers checks given
to him by a Contra leader.
   The retired Marine lieutenant colonel testified that he only
reimbursed himself for expenses incurred helping the rebels.
   He told jurors that on the advice of the late CIA Director
William Casey he destroyed ledger he kept to document all
disbursements from the secret operational fund.
   North also denied Keker's suggestion that he took $3,000 in cash
from arms dealer Richard V. Secord _ to help buy an $8,038 used car
in 1985.
   North said the money came from a ``family fund'' he kept in a
metal box bolted to the floor of his closet. The money was amassed
from an insurance settlement and change he emptied from his pants
pockets every Friday night, North said.
   North said he took $5,000 to buy a station wagon but decided
instead to purchase the more expensive car. North testified he put
down the $5,000 and paid the additional $3,000 later for the GMC
Suburban vehicle.
   But a used-car salesman disputed this testimony on Friday,
saying North had called him several times inquiring about a
newspaper ad for the GMC vehicle. North told him he intended to
partially finance the purchase through the White House Credit
Union, the salesman said.
   A former National Security Council secretary who disbursed
expense accounts, said North was so pinched for cash in 1984 he
complained he couldn't buy lunch or gas to drive home.
   She said these complaints stopped in 1985, when North controlled
a secret fund for the Contras in his office safe.
   ``I think the business of the purchase of the car and perhaps
the rebuttal testimony from the used-car salesman and the secretary
from the National Security Council may be damaging,'' said former
Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste.
   ``About the time these payments start coming in, the jury may
conclude that the temptation for all of this money was just too
much for Ollie North,'' said Ben-Veniste.
   ``If the jury finds he was involved in self-dealing then his
whole posture of moral rectitude is not going to wash,'' said
Ben-Veniste, who stressed that he did not attend the trial based
his views solely only on reports about the proceeding.
   Alan M. Dershowitz, a Harvard University law professor, said the
defense failure to question North again after Keker's damaging
cross-examination was a ``serious mistake.''
   Jurors were left with an image of North explaining how he used a
department-store typewriter to type letters to help fabricate proof
he paid for a $13,800 security fence around his home.
   North said he accepted the fence to protect his family in the
face of terrorist threats but admitted the cover-up.
   ``The last image they (jurors) had of North is being destroyed
on going and typing those letters,'' Dershowitz said.
   North is also charged with illegally accepting the security
system from Secord.
   Dershowitz also faulted defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr.
for not bringing out the car-purchase story during North's direct
testimony instead of leaving it to be developed by Keker on
cross-examination.
   ``Sullivan left far too much for Keker. He didn't sufficiently
deflect and defuse the nuclear weapons that Keker had in his
arsenal,'' Dershowitz said.
   The car story should have been told ``to the point of boredom so
that when Keker crossed on it the jury would have been yawning.''
   ``Unless North didn't tell his lawyers, I think Sullivan just
bungled it,'' Dershowitz said.
   Sullivan has refused to comment outside the courtroom on any
aspect of the case against North.
   Rothstein, alone, said North made a strong case for acquittal,
saying his explanation about the travelers check _ except the
car-purchase account _ was ``a believable story.''
   All agreed that the equivocal testimony by former national
security adviser Robert McFarlane weakened the prosecution's case
that North lied to Congress.
   McFarlane blamed North for giving him false information for
letters that the former national security adviser wrote to
Congress. But he backed off major points and changed his story.
   Although McFarlane testified as a prosecution witness, ``he blew
hot and cold,'' Rothstein said.
   Rothstein suggested that Sullivan may be gently suggesting that
the jury convict North of the security-fence charge but not the
other charges.
   ``That's a nice compromise verdict that the jury can find if
they are torn between guilt or innocence. That's not too bad a
result for North,'' Rothstein said.
   The gratuity charge carries a 2-year sentence, the lightest
penalty of the 12 counts against North.

   A stadium barrier collapsed Saturday
from the weight of thousands of fans at a soccer match, injuring
scores of people. One witness said some fans were killed.
   Police did not immediately confirm any deaths, but many people
lay on the field being treated by emergency ambulance crews. Dozens
were carried away on stretchers or on advertising billboards.
   British Broadcasting Corp. radio and television said the
incident at Hillsborough stadium in northern England was
``extremely serious.''
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said some of
the victims were given cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
   The accident occurred at the English Football Association Cup
semifinal match between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The game
was officially called off about an hour after the incident.
   The game in Sheffield had been going on only six minutes when a
barrier holding thousands of Liverpool fans behind one of the goals
collapsed, crushing scores of spectators and forcing others onto
the field.
   Reports said many of the Liverpool fans had entered the section
without tickets through a broken gate.
   ``People just walked in that gate and the police just let them
walk in. There are people lying dead there on the floor,'' one
unidentified fan told the BBC.
   Officially, the game attracted a capacity crowd at the
54,000-seat Hillsborough facility. Broadcast reports, however, said
hundreds more attended.
   Police confirmed there was ``a surge of fans'' at the Liverpool
supporters' end of the stadium. Reports said violence did not play
any part in the crush, which appeared to be purely a result of
overcrowding.
   Saturday's accident came less than a week after the ruling body
of European soccer, the Union of European Football Associations,
announced it was lifting its ban on English teams in time for the
1990-91 season.
   The ban was imposed after the May, 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy
in Brussels, Belgium when 39 supporters, most of them Italian, died
in a stampede by Liverpool fans at the European Champions Cup final
against Juventus of Turin.
   The English Football Association Cup is the world's oldest
domestic single elimination soccer tournament and the winners of
the Liverpool-Forest semifinal were assured a place in next month's
championship game at Wembley Stadium.

<TEXT>
   The appointment of a Jesuit as president of the
New York Public Library has pitted some of the city's literary
lions against each other and raised questions about whether his vow
of papal obedience could compromise scholarship, free speech and
the rights of homosexuals.
   The Rev. Timothy Healy, president of Georgetown University,
agreed in February to succeed Vartan Gregorian, who was leaving to
become president of Brown University.
   At Georgetown, Healy had a reputation as a good teacher and an
exceptional fund-raiser _ the school's endowment rose from $30
million to almost $250 million during his 13 years there. Not
coincidentally, the library, which bills itself as one of the five
greatest in the world with four research branches and 81
neighborhood branches, is in the midst of a campaign to raise $157
million from private sources.
   The selection was greeted by a wave of hosannas. The president
of the American Council on Education said Healy would ``get the
movers and shakers of New York interested in the library.'' Former
U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, who teaches at Georgetown,
called Healy ``a nearly perfect fit'' for the job and a man who
``really loves New York'' and has ``the style of a Richard Burton.''
   The 65-year-old Healy, a native New Yorker who once worked
summers stacking books at the library, seemed to have found a
fitting place to end his career. ``It's home,'' he said. ``I grew
up in this town.''
   But last month the weekly Village Voice ran a story headlined
``Scholar or Bigot?'' that focused on Healy's clashes with gay
student groups at Georgetown, and a New York Times editorialist
wondered why a church with a critical shortage of priests could
find no better use for this one than running a public library.
   In a letter to the Times, author Gay Talese wondered about a
conflict between the Jesuit's vow of obedience to the pope and the
librarian's obligations to ``those who disagree with his church.''
   Talese's letter brought a rebuttal from author Garry Wills, who
accused him of ``raising the issue of `Catholic loyalty' that was
brought against John F. Kennedy in 1960. ... Is Mr. Talese hinting
that an American Catholic cannot believe in freedom of the press?''
   Next up was ``Catch-22'' author Joseph Heller, who said Wills
missed the point. Healy, he wrote, is not just any Catholic, he is
a priest of a church with ``stern, outspoken attitudes toward such
matters as obscenity, heresy, blasphemy, birth control and a host
of others.'' The letter wondered if a priest could be head ``of a
secular, public institution.''
   Meanwhile, some homosexuals complained that Healy refused to
recognize gay student groups at Georgetown and tried to deny them
access to school facilities. They also questioned how he would
treat homosexuals who work at the library. Other library staffers
said his presence could have a chilling effect on their efforts to
foster knowledge on such subjects as AIDS.
   Healy declined a request for an interview, but in an interview
with the Times he said there would be no conflict between his
religious and academic vocations.
   ``I work for the board of trustees,'' he said. ``No
ecclesiastical authority has any power over me in the conduct of my
business at the library. None.'' If a conflict arose, he said, he
would quit the job.
   In recent years, several priests and nuns have run into
conflicts because of their secular jobs in government.
   The Rev. Robert Drinan of Boston, a Jesuit, gave up his seat in
the U.S. House in 1980 when the pope decreed that a priest could
not also hold political office.
   A nun, Arlene Violet, quit the Sisters of Mercy to become Rhode
Island attorney general in 1984. Another nun, Agnes Mary Monsour,
chose to leave the sisterhood to remain director of Michigan social
services, which handles some abortion funding.
   But Healy said that while he served as vice chancellor for
academic affairs at the City University of New York, a public
institution, from 1969 to 1976, ``there was never any religious
tension.'' He also noted that he has permission from his order to
run a public library.
   About the sanctity of research, Healy said that at Georgetown,
he was acting as the head of a Catholic institution that could not
condone sex outside marriage. ``The New York Public Library is not
a Catholic institution,'' he said.

<HEAD>Judge Refuses To Drop Eastern Suit Against Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge Saturday said he has refused to dismiss a
$1.5 billion racketeering lawsuit accusing Eastern's unions of
trying to wreck the airline in order to force its sale at a loss.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said he was not ruling on
the merits of Eastern's arguments, only the legal requirements for
pursuing the lawsuit.
   The suit was filed last May, before the 6-week-old strike by the
Machinists union forced the airline to seek bankruptcy protection.
   A $464 million deal by former baseball commissioner Peter
Ueberroth to buy strike-crippled Eastern fell through last week
over union demands that a trustee replace Texas Air Corp. chairman
Frank Lorenzo while the airline changes hands.
   Eastern's suit seeks to hold the Machinists, the Air Line Pilots
Association and several union officials responsible for any damages
from a forced sale.
   It accuses ALPA and the Machinists of ``attempting to obtain
ownership and control of Eastern through extortion to destroy the
company's business and smear its reputation,'' said Eastern
spokesman Robin Matell.
   The judge said he will issue a written ruling this week.

<HEAD>Trump Adds Another Atlantic City Hotel for $63 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump, the owner of three Atlantic City
hotel-casinos, said Saturday he plans to add a fourth with the $63
million purchase of the financially troubled Atlantis Hotel Casino.
   But Trump wants to eliminate the casino and convert the Atlantis
into a luxury hotel, said Dan Klores, a spokesman for the developer.
   The purchase is subject to approval by the New Jersey Casino
Control Commission.
   Trump will purchase the hotel-casino from Elsinore, a company
that took the 501-room hotel over from Playboy.
   The gaming commission last week denied a license renewal for the
Atlantis. The Atlantis has suffered heavy losses since opening in
1981 as the Playboy Hotel and Casino. It emerged last fall from
federal bankruptcy reorganization.
   Trump owns and operates Trump Plaza and Trump Castle and will
soon open a third hotel-casino, the Taj Mahal.

<HEAD>Antiterrorist Measures to Be Discussed by Baker and Soviet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III will
discuss possible U.S.-Soviet cooperation in fighting terrorism when
he meets with his Soviet counterpart in Moscow next month,
administration officials say.
   The issue arose briefly when Baker met with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze in Vienna in March, and since then
U.S. officials have been exploring ways they think the Soviets
might be able to help, the sources said.
   The U.S. view of such cooperation soured a bit following
disclosure recently that Moscow secretly sold Su-24 bombers to
Libya.
   Libya leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi supports terrorism, Baker said
in a speech Friday. ``And how does this sale assist in the
worldwide efforts _ supposedly supported by Moscow _ to control
chemical weapons that Libya is developing at its Rabta plant?''
   The State Department counterrorism office remains cool to the
idea of cooperating with the Kremlin, but it has found some support
with the European bureau, which handles day-to-day affairs with
Moscow, said administration officials who spoke on condition they
not be identified by name.
   Baker, in confirmation hearings before the Senate, said he
wanted to discuss terrorism within the framework of ongoing
U.S.-Soviet negotiations.
   A U.S. position is being prepared for the Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting to determine the extent to which the Soviets are willing to
cooperate, the sources said.
   The department's annual report on terrorism said that despite a
``more constructive approach ... the Soviets continued to provide
arms, training, and materiel and diplomatic support to a range of
states and groups linked to terrorism.''
   Hope may be drawn from the fact that ``the Soviets are training
fewer people overall,'' said an administration terrorism expert.
   Moscow and its allies, according to Western analysts and
intelligence operatives, have trained Palestinian and other
terrorists and provided safe haven for such terrorists as Abu
Nidal, who for years was allowed to maintain an office in Poland.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said he was prepared
to cooperate with the United States in fighting terrorism. A senior
official of the KGB intelligence service said in a Radio Moscow
interview in January that in counterrorism, ``we are willing, if
there is a need, to cooperate even with the CIA, British
intelligence, and the Israeli Mossad and other services in the
West.''
   In one concrete example, last December Soviet authorities
negotiated directly with Israel _ with which they do not have
diplomatic ties _ and obtained the return of four people who
commandeered a Soviet plane to Israel.
   State Department officials also were heartened by an unusual
U.S.-Soviet conference last January in Moscow, which did not
involve government-to-government contacts but was attended by
several leading American experts on terrorism.
   Two of the Americans, Robert Kupperman of the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, and Brian
Jenkins of the Rand Corp., sometimes work as government
consultants, although both stressed that they went to Moscow as
private citizens.
   The Russian side included officials from the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs and the Ministry of Internal Affairs, which runs the
domestic police.
   Kupperman said he was surprised at how far the Soviets were
willing to go in exploring specific steps each nation could take
against actions that, for example, ``could involve mass casualties,
including nuclear, chemical or biological incidents.''
   Jenkins, who is publishing a report on the meeting, said the
participants ``backed away from some of the most contentious
issues, such as training the Soviet Union has in the past supplied
to some of these organizations.''
   Jenkins, describing himself as ``hardnosed skeptic,'' proposed
establishing guidelines to judge whether the Soviets are in fact
cooperating.
   Such guidelines would provide a rough measure of Soviet
political support for so-called ``national liberation movements,''
military aid to guerrillas, and help the Soviets give to terrorists
such as Abu Nidal.
   But, said Jenkins, ``we cannot establish impossible criteria. We
have to acknowledge that the Soviet government is big, with
competing elements, and some of those elements are going to
continue to do things that we think they ought not to do.''
   ``We cannot find out whether this is a ploy without exploring
this further,'' said Jenkins.
   ``We also have to keep in mind that we have difficulties
sustaining international cooperation against terrorism even among
countries with whom we have shared common political and legal
traditions for two centuries and who have been our military allies
for four decades,'' said Jenkins.

   Would-be millionaires today bought 15,000 tickets
a minute for a shot at $65 million, the biggest lottery jackpot in
U.S. history.
   ``I don't know anyone who hasn't bought one and it seems like
everyone is talking about it this time around,'' said Chicago
flight attendant Jane Chartier. ``There really is a fever about
it.''
   By Friday night more than 31.7 million tickets had been sold for
today's 6:57 p.m. drawing, said Illinois lottery spokeswoman Kathy
Rem.
   She said about a million tickets were sold hourly during most of
the day, with people lining up at lottery outlets. By 6 p.m., sales
registered at more than 1.6 million an hour, or 465 a second, she
said.
   Tickets were reported selling at a rate of 250 a second today.
   Players said they were planning to watch the televised drawing
and hope for the best.
   Some said their hopes were boosted by good omens.
   Ted Tyson of Napa, Calif., in Chicago for an International
Business Machines Corp. training program, said he ate at a Chinese
restaurant, cracked open a fortune cookie, and read: ``The star of
riches is shining upon you.''
   Mary Hickey of Chicago said she ``just had a good feeling _ you
know, like you do sometimes when you're playing poker.''
   Even Larry Eyestone of Urbana, who won a $1.4 million Illinois
Lotto jackpot in 1983, said he had hope of scoring another win.
   ``I figure lightning can strike again,'' he said.
   In the drawing, six numbers between 1 and 54 are chosen, and the
winner must match all six.
   There are 25.8 million possible combinations of numbers that
could be drawn, Ms. Rem said.
   Gambling travelers lined up at O'Hare International Airport,
where sales for today's drawing have been just about double the
average, said Bob Flynn of the Paralyzed Veterans of America, which
runs the airport's six Lotto kiosks.
   The jackpot for Saturday Lotto drawings begin at a base of $5
million. But the last winner was March 18, and unclaimed prizes and
excess ticket sale proceeds are rolled over into subsequent prizes.
   Ms. Rem said a state tax would claim 2.5 percent of the prize,
and the federal tax would be 20 percent. This jackpot guarantees a
single winner 20 annual payments of $3.1 million. Multiple winners
would split the winnings.
   Lottery officials say people have called from Italy, France,
England and the Netherlands to ask how they can play.
   And of course, across Illinois, people were contemplating a win.
   ``My ex-wife would marry me back, believe me,'' said Jim Ocello
of Chicago.
   ``If I won, no one would find me again,'' said John Roate of
Springfield. ``I'd move to some place warm. With that kind of
money, you could probably buy an island.''

<TEXT>
   Sumptuous 15th century Persian art inspired by
the legendary Mongol warlord Tamerlane, drawn from private and
public collections around the world, goes on display Sunday at the
Smithsonian Institution's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery of Asian Art.
   The exhibition, entitled ``Timur and the Princely Vision,'' was
organized over the last five years by the Sackler and the Los
Angeles County Museum of Art, where it will be shown from
mid-August through early November after its Washington engagement
ends on July 6.
   Renowned for his military genius and personal charisma,
Tamerlane, known as Timur in Islamic history, led an army of
semi-nomadic warriors out of the Central Asian steppes in the late
14th century and conquered a vast territory stretching from China
to the shores of the Mediterranean.
   To solidify his dynasty's political authority, Tamerlane and his
princely successors embraced Islamic religious and cultural
traditions. By the end of the 15th century, his grandsons'
craftsmen were producing rich, elaborate paintings, calligraphy,
tilework, metalwork, ceramics and textiles that became models for
successive Islamic artisans around the world.
   The Sackler exhibition seeks to demonstrate the transformation
of Tamerlane's followers from crude, barbaric warriors to patrons
of some of the most brilliant and sophisticated works of art and
architecture ever produced, said curators Thomas W. Lentz of the
Los Angeles museum and Glenn D. Lowry of the Sackler.
   The show includes 160 Timurid paintings, works in metal,
ceramics, calligraphies, jade and wood carvings and textiles loaned
by 50 institutions. They include the Egyptian National Library, the
Topkapi Palace Museum and the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum in
Istanbul, the State Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the State
Treasury in the Kremlin in Moscow.
   Among the rarest objects in the show are the earliest known suit
of Islamic mail and plate armor in iron and gold, lent by a Saudi
sheik, and an intricately carved sandalwood box, lined in red and
gold silk, which Lentz said is ``the most luxurious and finest
example of wood carving in the world.''
   Another spectacular piece, on loan from the Kremlin, is a 15th
century ``cloud collar,'' an elaborately embroidered silk
ornamental collar for a robe. Two dragon-handled gold cups, dating
from the early 14th century, were loaned by the Hermitage Museum,
which has never before displayed them publicly.

<TEXT>
   America's worst-ever oil spill reached the
shore of a second national park, raising fears today that bears
would join sea mammals, birds and deer as casualties of the Exxon
Valdez wreck.
   Oil washed up Friday at the Big River area along the northern
coast of Katmai National Park, an undeveloped area beside the
Shelikof Strait, more than 250 miles from where the tanker rammed a
reef on March 24.
   Observers from a plane saw a bear dig clams from the oil-tainted
sand, said Park Service spokesman John Quinley.
   ``We've seen pictures of dead deer in Prince William Sound that
ate oil-tainted kelp, and it looks like we could be seeing brown
bear meeting the same fate,'' Quinley said.
   Park officials said bears are just beginning to come out of
hibernation and heading to beaches to feed.
   The weather forecast held more bad news: winds from the
southeast were expected to push more oil ashore in the area.
   Exxon was to hand over a detailed shoreline cleanup plan today
to the head of the Coast Guard, Adm. Paul Yost. The plan was to
include the number of people and the amount of gear needed to begin
scouring some of the 3,000 beaches blackened by the oil spill.
   Oil has been washing ashore at Kenai Fjords National Park for a
week, and residents of such fishing and tourist towns as Homer,
Kodiak, Seldovia and Port Graham were preparing to try to block the
spreading spill today.
   But encouraging signs also emerged.
   Pilot Bill DeCreeft flew over the Nuka Bay area late Friday to
help track the oil's progress. ``I was quite encouraged,'' he said
today. ``I saw places where oil had hit the beach, but essentially
it looks like it always did.''
   Big River was No. 2 on a list of nine places at Katmai where
park officials believe floating booms may be able to shield salmon
spawning areas, brown bear habitat, bird nesting areas and native
Alaskan sites from the ribbons of oil.
   Exxon was to send ships with booms in today, but some residents
of Kodiak, the nation's No. 1 port in terms of dollars earned, were
unwilling to wait that long, Quinley said Friday night.
   ``Twelve fishing vessels set out for the Katmai coast tonight to
try to control the oil,'' he said.
   He had no details on how much oil had washed up, and Exxon's
offices had closed for the night.
   By Friday, the thick oil and sheen from the crash of the Exxon
Valdez tanker had drifted down Prince William Sound, defiling
thousands of boulder-strewn beaches, 225 miles southwest to the tip
of the Kenai Peninsula, where sea currents divide.
   Some oil then moved down the east side of the Kodiak Islands,
with spottings reported at Afognak Island and as far south as the
waters of the community of Kodiak, about 300 miles from the
accident site.
   The oil that was on the other side of the Kodiak archipelago and
had threatened the Katmai park included a 40-square-mile patch of
heavy oil and sheen in Shelikof Strait.
   Thousands of birds and mammals have died in the washed-up muck,
and there were continued fears of damage to salmon, herring, crab
and other rich fisheries throughout the region.
   The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, veered sharply out of
shipping lanes and rammed the reef early Good Friday morning.
   Yost, the Coast Guard chief who has taken over direction of the
cleanup, has called the effort to deal with the spill a ``war.''
   He vowed to put soldiers on the beaches for the cleanup, if
needed, but said he would promise no miracles in what is sure to be
a monthslong effort. He and state authorities have been highly
critical of Exxon's cleanup efforts during the past three weeks.
   Scientists were assembling a list of critical and non-critical
beaches for cleanup. Yost said high-pressure, hot-water jets would
be used to cleanse at least some of the shore, although the method
likely would leave behind sterile ``dead beaches.''
   ``It's my view that we'd do better with high pressure and heat
and doing some environmental damage,'' he said. ``The beaches will
recolonize in a year or two. They won't if the oil is not removed.''

   The blue-and-white signs dot Oklahoma
highways, informing motorists that the stretch of asphalt has been
adopted by a fraternity, a humane society, a motorcycle club.
   They're part of an effort to put everyday people to the unending
task of keeping highways from looking like garbage dumps, and
officials say that despite some concerns about safety, the
adopt-a-highway idea is booming.
   ``It's going into beautification and really a pride of
communities. ... Not only that, but competition between
communities, which adds even more emphasis,'' said Wayne Muri,
chief engineer for the Missouri Highway and Transportation
Department.
   Nine hundred groups are participating in Missouri, and they've
not only picked up trash, they've planted millions of daffodils.
   In Oklahoma, which began the program in 1987, Gov. Henry Bellmon
joined 20,000 volunteers April 8 in the state's first Trash-Off. In
all, 1,000 groups have adopted a couple of miles of highway and get
to see their name on the sign.
   The birthplace of the notion was Texas, which had a problem that
was, well, Texas-sized. The problem gave rise to a ``Don't mess
with Texas'' celebrity ad campaign and the adopt-a-highway program,
which now involves more than 3,250 groups.
   More than 20 states have followed with their own adopt-a-highway
programs.
   Texas highway officials concerned about liability for the people
out picking up trash decided on a one-year pilot program just
around Tyler, but demand for the program was too great from people
elsewhere.
   ``We bit the bullet and went with it,'' said Billy Black, a
public affairs officer for the Texas highway department who was
co-developer of the program. ``We're getting sued for something
every day, anyway.''
   Some states, like South Dakota, are still drawing up safety
rules.
   ``We've been very fortunate,'' Muri said in Missouri. ``The
folks out there have been very safety conscious.''
   In Oklahoma, Joanne Orr, beautification director for the
Department of Transportation, said the state has developed an
eight-minute videotape on safety _ wear gloves, stay on one side of
the road at a time and don't pick up syringes or guns.
   The signs cost the highway departments about $35. Groups must
pick up litter four times a year or the signs come down. Oher
expenses include trash bags and personnel to pick up the bagged
litter.
   Officials say the expense is well worth it. ``Oklahoma has
116,000 acres of roadside. That, in effect, is our front yard,''
Ms. Orr said.

<HEAD>A Lot More Than 30 Cents An Hour At Stake In Minimum Wage Fight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The showdown between President Bush and
Congress over the minimum wage is an eagerly contested battle many
believe will set the course of the nation's domestic and political
agenda for the 101st Congress if not the next four years.
   With Democrats in Congress pushing an ambitious package of
domestic programs the new administration opposes, both sides of the
minimum-wage fight view this first confrontation as a major test of
resolve.
   ``If the president gets rolled on the minimum wage then we will
see a plethora of big and bigger spending programs at a time in our
country's history when we can least afford it,'' said Republican
Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
   ``What George Bush has done here is he's chosen this issue to
make a stand,'' Hatch said in an interview Friday. ``This is a big
stakes game.''
   Democrats see it that way was well.
   ``We're going to battle on this issue until we get it done, and
we're going to be successful,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass. ``The minimum wage has helped get a lot of Democrats
elected over the years and contributed to the defeat of a lot of
Republicans. This is a classic confrontation between Democrats as a
party which cares for working people and Republicans who don't.''
   Republicans concede Democrats may win a political issue if the
president vetos legislation raising the minimum wage.
   Democrats and organized labor are preparing to promote the issue
as one of fairness in the mold of their successful campaign last
year to win public support for legislation giving workers advance
notice of plant closings.
   They also are quick to talk about Bush's support for reducing
capital gains taxes, which would predominantly benefit the wealthy.
   ``The president wants thousands of dollars in capital gains
taxes for the rich but he can't spare three dimes for the working
poor,'' said Kennedy. ``That will linger.''
   But Bush, who lost the John Tower nomination fight in the
Senate, appears ready to ignore the potential political risk in
order to notch a victory.
   Thirty cents and four months separate the Democrats and Bush on
the minimum wage, which has been $3.35 an hour since 1981. The
legislation soon to reach the White House would raise the floor to
$4.55 an hour by October 1991 and allow some workers to be paid a
subminimum their first two months on the job. Bush has insisted he
will go no higher then $4.25 an hour and only if employers can pay
a subminimum for six months.
   Bush himself has acknowledged the significance of the battle,
ending a recent statement of his intention to veto the Democrats'
minimum wage bill with the declaration: ``I have too much at
stake.''
   Democrats say Bush has picked the wrong time for a fight.
   ``Public opinion is overwhelmingly on our side and every section
of the country understands the economic justice of our position,''
said Kennedy. ``It amazes me that the President Bush let himself be
trapped by the right wing of his party into making these veto
threats.''
   Yet it is Kennedy and fellow Democrats who set the agenda on
Capitol Hill, and they chose to tackle the minimum wage first
before moving on to other items on a lengthy domestic agenda that
includes legislation governing parental leave, child care, health
care and other issues on which the Congress and White House have
major differences.
   ``They're picking the fight because they see a political
winner,'' said Hatch. ``They're trying to stick it to him. The
president has to assert himself now.''
   Kennedy concedes Bush now has the votes to sustain a veto
although he said he was ``not prepared to say this fight isn't
winnable.''
   Labor's top lobbyist joined Kennedy in promising political
troubles to those who side with Bush.
   ``The people who are stopping the increase will have to face the
political consequences,'' said the AFL-CIO's Robert McGlotten.
   The outcome of the fight ``certainly will dictate the direction
of the 101st Congress,'' said McGlotten. ``And because of that, at
the White House they think they have to draw the line on the first
bill.''
   McGlotten said he expects a Bush veto but added, ``Everytime I
say that I remember Ronald Reagan said `never' on plant closing and
now we have a law.''
   Then-Vice President Bush took heat during his presidential
campaign when Reagan vetoed the plant-closing bill and, when
Congress passed it again, Bush reportedly urged Reagan not to veto
it again.
   Hatch said those election-year pressures are missing this time
and that Bush would lose stature if he gave in on the minimum wage.
   ``He needs to send a message that he is strong enough to use his
veto power and that he is not going to be pushed just because there
may or may not be a political advantage to the Democrats,'' said
Hatch.

<HEAD>Hmong Resisting Warnings About Lead In Folk Medicine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Folk medicines for ailments such as fever and
chicken pox are contributing to a high rate of lead poisoning among
Hmong children, officials say.
   Last year, the Southeast Asian children made up more than 60
percent of the lead poisoning cases reported to the city public
health division. In the first several months of this year, eight of
13 cases were Hmong, the division said.
   While health officials attribute most of the cases to
environmental factors, such as lead paint chips in old housing and
contaminated soil, they say the Hmong's use of medicinal powders is
a contributing factor.
   Over the past six years, tests of medicinal powders used by some
Hmong families found some with high levels of lead and arsenic,
including one batch containing 90 percent lead, said Tim Ringhand,
a public health nurse.
   Despite warnings, Hmong parents continue using the medicine
because they find it hard to believe their children are in danger,
officials said. There is no Hmong word for lead and effects of lead
poisoning don't show up for years.
   ``For Hmong people, it's not because they're not caring of their
children,'' said Pam Thao, a bilingual health assistant. ``The
problem is they're too protecting. They don't trust outsiders.''
   Some members of the Hmong community said the studies linking
lead to their medicinal powders are an attack on their culture.
   ``We've been using the medicine for years, long before the birth
of this country,'' said Nkajlo Vangh, president of Lao Family
Community of Minnesota. ``I'd like to get a second opinion.''
   Health officials said have no firm idea of how prevalent the
medicinanl powders are because few families admit to using them.
   ``If they took away my Tylenol in (Laos) and gave me powders,
then I'd be angry too. I'd hide my Tylenol,'' Ringhand said.

<TEXT>
   The magnolia tree is in full bloom and
sprinklers cast a soft mist on the flower beds. Lainz hospital's
well-tended grounds are peaceful, a quiet facade behind which a
tale of multiple murder was played out.
   The shadow of death lies over Pavilion Five, where four nurses'
aides have confessed to killing at least 49 elderly patients with
injections, which they are not supposed to administer, or by
forcing water into a victim's lungs.
   They claimed to have done it out of mercy, but police say the
methods were not merciful.
   Tragedy, grief and misfortune are ever-present in hospitals, and
people who work in them know the analgesic value of routine.
   In the wards and corridors of Lainz, it continues unchanged.
Beds are made, patients fed, temperatures taken.
   So strong was the impulse to cling to routine despite the
killings that, when a reporter asked to interview a ranking
hospital doctor, a secretary asked: ``What's it about?''
   An hour later, she too was struck by the sense of shock and
depression patients say has begun to stalk the wards, and said with
a gasp: ``The boss has been suspended!''
   That was five days after Austria first learned of the killings
in the hospital department run by the suspended doctor, Franz
Pesendorfer, a respected internist in his early 50s.
   At first, the story seemed too incredible even for tabloids that
deal in lurid tales of sex and crime. The Neue Kronen Zeitung,
Austria's largest- circulation daily, carried a bold headline but
had only a small story inside.
   Two days later, when four nursing assistants were said to have
confessed to at least 44 killings, the story covered seven pages in
the paper's editions for Sunday, April 9.
   Leaks to news media, apparently from police, revealed such
graphic details that police chief Guenter Boegl reluctantly
confirmed the stories at an unusual Sunday news conference.
   The medical profession was stunned.
   ``I wasn't surprised; I wasn't horrified. I just couldn't
imagine how it happened,'' said Hildegard Fach, head of the
national union for nurses and their aides.
   ``It's incomprehensible,'' she added in an interview six days
after the first word of the murders. ``Everywhere I go, colleagues
are saying, `Can you imagine?'''
   As the shock sank in, public anger mounted and trust in Vienna's
overtaxed health services began to evaporate.
   By Friday, a week after the first reports, city health director
Alois Stacher had received so many reports of nurses and their
aides being yelled at in the streets that he appealed to Viennese
to stop.
   Psychiatrist Stefan Rudas said of the sense of mistrust in
hospitals: ``It's as if waiters in a restaurant had served poison
or teachers killed their pupils.''
   Ms. Fach said she hopes one result of the killings will be more
money for health services.
   ``People in Austria ... will have to realize that health costs
money and that you can't scrimp,'' she said.
   Medical students in Vienna often say there is little prospect of
finding jobs in city hospitals, although they know they are needed.
   According to Ms. Fach, the city needs 200-400 qualified nurses.
She said a study last year found that 1,600 more were necessary if
patients were to be guaranteed ``optimal care'' and nurses a
43-hour work week.
   She and other medical personnel have said repeatedly that Vienna
hospitals only keep going by violating regulations that bar nurses'
aides from giving injections. Except in emergencies, doctors are
not even supposed to turn injections over to registered nurses.
   Waltraud Wagner, the 30-year-old nursing aid said to be
responsible for most of the Lainz killings, was reported to have
``put to rest'' elderly patients with injections of insulin,
tranquilizers and other medicines.
   According to the police warrant, she showed fellow aides Maria
Gruber, 25; Irene Leidolf, 27, and Stefanie Mayer, 50, how to
prepare the deadly injections, and let them watch while she held a
patient's tongue and poured water into the lungs.
   Two central questions still unanswered are: Why did they do it
and how did the killings continue over several years without
exposure?
   All the women except Ms. Mayer are from large families in small
villages. Their pay is low and they had little spare money, but
they got no richer by killing impoverished old people.
   A twisted sense of mercy killing or a sense of power may have
played a part, but that would not explain why they worked together,
as Ms. Fach noted.
   Nearly all medical personnel in other countries have acted alone
when they killed elderly patients and claimed they wanted to
release them from agony.
   Police warrants suggest the killings began in 1983.
Investigators were called to Lainz hospital almost exactly a year
ago after Dr. Pesendorfer heard rumors that nurses aides in his
department were killing patients.
   He and another doctor refused, in an action now widely
criticized, to name the doctor who had passed on the initial tip
from a nurses' aide.
   Investigator Max Edelbacher said police finally tracked down the
doctor, Alois Waschnig, and played ``almost a game of
hide-and-seek'' to speak with him.
   Waschnig refused to reveal his source and Edelbacher said police
could not force him to do so.
   An autopsy at the time on an 84-year-old woman Ms. Wagner is
said to have admitted killing also turned up nothing suspicious and
the case was closed.

   A chain-link fence holding back
thousands of people at a soccer match collapsed today, and a
spokesman for an ambulance company said 95 people were crushed to
death and 180 injured.
   Some of the fans apparently died when the surging crowd jammed
them against the fence, located at one end of the stadium. Others
were killed when the barrier caved in and the crowd fell toward the
field. The fence was topped with curved steel bars designed to stop
spectators from climbing over it.
   News reports indicated the area of the stadium was overcrowded
because many fans had entered without tickets.
   Television pictures showed scores of fans lying on the field
being treated by emergency ambulance crews. Dozens of fans were
carried away on stretchers or on advertising billboards used as
makeshift beds.
   The accident occurred in the opening minutes of the English
Football Association Cup semifinal between Liverpool and Nottingham
Forest, two leading teams, at Hillsborough stadium in Sheffield,
150 miles north of London.
   The game was six minutes old when a fence holding thousands of
Liverpool fans behind one of the goals collapsed, crushing the
spectators.
   Ray Clarke, spokesman for the Ambulance Service, said in a
telephone interview that 95 people died and 180 were injured in the
accident, the worst disaster ever at a British soccer event.
(Although Americans call the game soccer, all other countries refer
to it as football.)
   Football Association officials said many of the Liverpool
backers entered the section without tickets through a gate that was
either broken or opened, swelling the section allocated for its
fans beyond the permitted capacity.
   ``It looks a desperate situation,'' said the Football
Association's chief executive, Graham Kelly. ``I am deeply sorry
that the day has ended this way. We had six minutes of football and
one and a half hours of absolute bedlam.''
   Officially, the game attracted a capacity crowd at the
54,000-seat Hillsborough facility.
   But reports said hundreds more Liverpool fans without tickets
poured through a turnstile gate behind one of the goals, packing an
area marked off for the team's followers and crushing those at the
front of the stand.
   ``A gate or gates were opened or broken and fans came in,''
Kelly said. ``There were too many fans in the area, obviously, and
they spilled over. There will be a full investigation.''
   One unidentified fan told the BBC: ``People just walked in that
gate and the police just let them walk in. There are people lying
dead there on the floor. It was chockablock and as people tried to
get into the front the police tried to force them back into the
ground. This ground was allocated for an F.A. Cup Final because it
could have dealt with any problems and now it hasn't.''
   The English Football Association Cup is the world's oldest,
domestic single elimination soccer tournament and the winners of
the Liverpool-Forest semifinal were assured a place in next month's
championship game at Wembley stadium.
   Ninety minutes after the incident, the ground was virtually
cleared by police and the game canceled.
   Reports said crowd violence played no part in the crush, which
appeared to be purely a result of overcrowding.
   The tragedy came less than a week after the ruling body of
European soccer, the Union of European Football Associaitons,
announced it was lifting its ban on English teams in time for the
1990-91 season.
   The ban was imposed after the May 1985 Heysel stadium tragedy in
Brussels, Belgium, in which 39 supporters, most of them Italian,
died in a stampede by Liverpool fans at the European Champions Cup
final against Juventus of Turin.
   Today's disaster was the worst ever at a British soccer event.
   On Jan. 2, 1971, 66 people died when an overcrowded stairway
collapsed during a local soccer match between Glasgow Rangers and
Celtic in Glasgow, Scotland. Fifty-six fans died on May 11, 1985,
when a fire engulfed the main stand during a match at Bradford
City's soccer stadium near Sheffield.
   The worst soccer disaster on record took place on May 24, 1964,
when rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after Argentina
beat Peru on a last-minute goal in Lima.

<HEAD>Ex-Byrds Sue Band Member Over Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three early members of the 1960s folk-rock
group The Byrds have sued a fourth member to stop him from using
the band's name.
   The lawsuit filed Friday in federal court came three months
after Michael Clarke, the group's original drummer, applied for
exclusive rights to the name. Clarke has announced plans to tour as
The Byrds, featuring Michael Clarke.
   Roger McGuinn, David Crosby and Chris Hillman sued Clarke,
Artists International Management Inc. of Boca Raton and AIM agent
Steve Green, alleging false advertising, unfair competition and
deceptive trade practices.
   ``Their intent is obviously to stop Michael from earning a
living,'' Green said. ``We think the whole thing stinks a mile high
_ make that eight miles high.''
   ``Eight Miles High'' was a 1966 hit for The Byrds, who also were
known for Bob Dylan's ``Mr. Tambourine Man'' in 1965 and Pete
Seeger's ``Turn! Turn! Turn!'' in 1966.
   McGuinn, Crosby and Hillman performed a series of concerts in
Los Angeles this year to try to solidify their right to the band's
name.
   The suit downplays the contributions of Clarke, who left the
group in 1968. The Byrds stopped performing in 1973.
   Clarke ``did not contribute to the group's distinctive guitar
sound, lead vocals or vocal harmonies,'' the suit charged.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 72-year-old Christian parliamentarian
died Saturday when a rocket hit his apartment building during
shelling duels between Syrian and Christian gunners, police said.
   A Lebanese navy gunboat ferried 14 badly wounded Christians to a
French naval vessel anchored off Beirut as a French humanitarian
aid mission got under way. It was unclear whether Moslems would
participate.
   Police said intermittent shelling duels intensified before
sundown as gunners from both sides blasted Beirut and its
surroundings, killing four people and wounding 31.
   The casualties raised the overall toll to 219 dead and 758
wounded from the five-week battle between Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
mostly Christian troops and an alliance of Syrian and Druse forces.
   An Italian tanker with a cargo of diesel oil, the Cochinella,
was hit by a shell eight miles off Beirut on Saturday, an Italian
Embassy official said.
   The embassy's charge d'affaires, Attilo Iannucci, said the top
deck was damaged but none of the 14 Italian crewmen was hurt. He
said the ship, which was heading for the Christian port of Jounieh
north of Beirut, was returning to Cyprus.
   A police spokesman said the legislator, Louis Abu Sharaf, was
killed when a rocket landed near his apartment on the third floor
of an eight-story building in Christian east Beirut. He said the
rockets were launched from the divided capital's Moslem sector.
   Abu Sharaf was the first legislator to die in a shelling attack
in Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war. He represented Christian
Kesrouan province since 1960.
   His death raised to 23 the number of deputies who died since the
last parliamentary elections in 1972.
   The war between Christians and Moslems has prevented
parliamentary elections since then, and Abu Sharif's death reduced
the number of deputies in the 99-seat house to 75.
   The current violence erupted March 8 after Aoun ordered a
blockade of militia-run ports that strip the state treasury of
about $1 million annually in lost customs dues.
   Druse militiamen started shelling the Christian enclave in
retaliation.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in predominantly Moslem
areas under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate, joined in the
shelling duel on the side of the Druse.
   The French naval ship La Rance dropped anchor 10 miles off the
Christian port of Jounieh, where France's minister for humanitarian
aid, Bernard Kouchner, was supervising a mercy mission.
   France has strong ties with Lebanon, which it ruled from World
War I until independence in 1943.
   The fully equipped hospital ship was one of two carrying
humanitarian aid, which French officials say is intended for both
Christians and Moslems.
   But Moslems have said France was taking sides in the war and
renounced claims to their part of the aid.
   According to an agreement Kouchner reached with Moslems, the
second ship was to unload its cargo of fuel oil at two government
ports in Moslem and Christian sectors. The fuel is badly needed to
keep Lebanon's power stations operating.
   A Lebanese navy gunboat took wounded Christians to the La Rance
and then returned with medicine for hospitals in the
310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of Beirut.
   A Moslem official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Kouchner was trying to persuade Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem
Cabinet in Lebanon's dual government, to allow a similar evacuation
of wounded Moslems from west Beirut.
   The rival Christian and Moslem Cabinets emerged in September
after outgoing President Amin Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite
Catholic like himself, to head an interim military Cabinet pending
Parliament's election of a new head of state.
   But Moslems and leftists pledged allegiance to Hoss, who
governed under Gemayel. They claimed Aoun's appointment violated an
unwritten convention that made Lebanon's president a Maronite, the
premier a Sunni and the Parliament Speaker a Shiite Moslem.

<HEAD>Freshly Minted Budget Pact Already Coming Under Fire</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fiscal 1990 budget pact between President
Bush and Congress, produced in weeks of high-level bargaining and
praised as a lofty success by its authors, is already coming under
fire.
   These critics see the plan as a failure that soothes a political
headache for lawmakers and the president while taking only a
faint-hearted whack at the government's fiscal malaise.
   By its own reckoning, the deal whittles the troublesome federal
deficit to $99.4 billion, just within the $100 billion target
required by the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.
   And in the high-octane politics of the $1.2 trillion budget _ in
which protracted, pitched battles between Democrats and Republicans
are waged over the tiniest fractions of overall spending _ an
agreement of any kind is indisputably a major plus.
   ``The most significant aspect of this agreement is its existence
and that is no small accomplishment,'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said at the Rose Garden ceremony at which
Bush and congressional leaders announced the accord.
   But it is the assumptions the agreement makes, the savings it
claims, the work that remains to be done and the deficit problem it
leaves unaddressed that have many people raising their eyebrows.
   ``If American corporations prepared their financial statements
based on the way this proposal was put together, their officers
would go to jail,'' said Carol Cox, president of the bipartisan
Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and a former Senate
Budget Committee aide.
   The White House says it expects the deficit for fiscal 1989 _
which ends Sept. 30 _ to be about $163 billion.
   But administration and congressional leaders say they need only
find about $28 billion in savings to shrink the red ink for next
year to $99.4 billion.
   The rest of the reductions will occur automatically, they say,
because the economy will perform so well that the government will
take in more revenues and have to pay lower interest rates for the
money it borrows. Most economists are more pessimistic.
   ``It's a leap of faith to say those economic conditions will
hold,'' says Everett M. Ehrlich, chief economist for the Unisys
Corp. and former assistant director of the Congressional Budget
Office.
   Because those economic assumptions seem so unreal, the budget
pact ``is an extremely elaborate smoke screen behind which Congress
and the president can hide, claiming they're making progress on the
deficit,'' says Donald F. Kettl, a University of Virginia political
science professor who studies the federal budget process.
   Then there is the enormous scope of the job ahead. The accord
must be translated into a budget resolution passed by Congress, and
then more than a dozen separate bills will be fashioned to
implement the spending and taxing choices it enunciates. In many
cases, lawmakers will have to make decisions the bargainers left
unaddressed.
   The plan's authors defended it as the best they could come up
with considering their differences. Bush has a ``no new taxes''
campaign pledge to uphold, while Democrats want to preserve
domestic programs.
   ``A half a loaf is far better than the starvation diet'' of
automatic spending slashes under the Gramm-Rudman law, said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   But not everyone was as sanguine.
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, was so
disappointed in the final product that he refused to appear at the
White House when the deal was announced. Bentsen spokesman Jack
Devore said the senator thought the pact was ``marginal.'' Enacting
tax legislation without his support would be difficult.
   The government would raise $5.7 billion from selling some of its
assets. That can raise quick money, but it also can end up losing
potential income in the long run if loan portfolios are sold off.
   ``If a family is spending more than it takes in and is gathered
around the kitchen table to decide what to do, the thing we don't
want them to do is sell the table,'' says Ehrlich.
   The budget agreement picks up $5.3 billion in unspecified taxes,
even though Bush and congressional Democrats have been at each
other's throats over how that can be achieved. About $1.3 billion
in savings would come from shifting some payments to farmers
planned for 1990 into this year.
   Another $1.8 billion in savings would come simply by no longer
counting the Postal Service's losses in the budget. And $1.1
billion would be saved in lower interest payments on the national
debt _ now totalling about $180 billion annually _ as a result of
the savings in the rest of the plan, the parties claim.
   ``It appears this will barely gasp itself across the finish line
of meeting the extended Gramm-Rudman target,'' said attorney Jim
Jones, a former House Budget Committee chairman, referring to the
$10 billion cushion the law allows over the $100 billion deficit
target.
   And on the horizon lies work on the fiscal 1991 budget, which by
law must contain a deficit of no more than $64 billion. Should
Friday's plan fail to generate the savings it claims, reaching the
1991 goal will drift further and further out of reach.

<HEAD>Biography: JFK Left Behind Nuclear Codes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacqueline Kennedy, in telephone conversation
with Marilyn Monroe, offered to divorce President Kennedy if the
actress agreed to marry him and move into the White House, says a
new biography of the former first lady.
   The book also says the president once sneaked away for a sexual
liaison without telling the Secret Service or taking the list of
codes he needed in the event of a nuclear attack.
   The book by C. David Heymann, ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' will be
serialized beginning Monday in the weekly Star, a supermarket
tabloid.
   The Star reports in its April 18 edition that later excerpts
will include disclosures about amphetamine use by the Kennedys in
the White House.
   Heymann, also author of ``Poor Little Rich Girl: The Life and
Legend of Barbara Hutton,'' said that he obtained Secret Service,
FBI and CIA files through the Freedom of Information Act and that
he and his researchers conducted 825 interviews. He also had access
to Mrs. Kennedy's White House social files.
   Miss Monroe, who has been romantically linked with the
president, told Kennedy's brother-in-law Peter Lawford that she had
called Mrs. Kennedy at the White House, according to the first part
of the series.
   ``According to Marilyn, Jackie wasn't shaken by the call. Not
outwardly. She agreed to step aside. She would divorce Jack, and
Marilyn could marry him, but she would have to move into the White
House. If Marilyn wasn't prepared to live openly in the White
House, she might as well forget about it,'' Lawford was quoted as
saying.
   ``Actually, Jackie was infuriated by the call, and for some
reason blamed Frank Sinatra for it. She couldn't easily blame me
because I was family, so she took it out on him. Sinatra was no
longer welcome at the White House, or in any of the other Kennedy
bastions,'' said Lawford, who since has died.
   Mrs. Onassis' spokeswoman, Nancy Tuckerman, said Friday that
Mrs. Onassis had no comment.
   The charges about Kennedy sneaking away from the Secret Service
were made by Langdon Marvin Jr., a former defense consultant to
Kennedy.
   The book said Marvin and Kennedy sneaked out of the Hotel
Carlyle in New York to attend a party at a townhouse across the
street, the book says.
   ``Within minutes, Jack had made his choice of partner and gone
off with her to her apartment. Moments later, the Secret Service
arrived. Where was the president? Nobody knew. The agent paled.
   ``On the street in front of the townhouse stood an Army
lieutenant with an attache case handcuffed to his wrist. Jack was
off making love, and the bagman with the black satchel had been
left behind.
   ``The Russians could have bombed us to hell and back, and there
would have been nothing we could have done about it,'' Marvin was
quoted as saying.
   The date of the alleged incident was not given. Marvin died in
1987, according to Sandra Bodner, a spokeswoman for the publisher,
Lyle Stuart.
   ``We are not aware of any material that would support that
allegation,'' said Frank Rigg, a spokesman for the John F. Kennedy
Library in Boston.
   Kennedy also had illicit sexual liaisons on the night of his
inauguration and before the Nixon debates, the book said.

<HEAD>Student Protests Continue at New Mexico, Wayne State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Students at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and
Wayne State University in Detroit occupied buildings Saturday in
sit-ins aimed at rolling back a tuition increase and boosting black
studies.
   UNM President Gerald May, whose outer office has been held since
Tuesday, said Friday the school's regents would meet as soon as
possible to reconsider a $50-a-semester tuition increase to help
pay for faculty raises.
   Protesters said they would continue the sit-in but promised to
tidy May's office, which has become cluttered with bedrolls, books
and paper cups.
   Students began camping out in the office on Tuesday after
regents approved an increase that would bring tuition and fees to
$686 a semester. About 40 students took part Saturday. May has
continued to use his inner office.
   In Detroit, black students who have occupied a Wayne State
building since Wednesday said they will meet with administrators
Monday to discuss their demands for stepped-up minority student and
faculty recruitment and a requirement that each faculty member
teach a course in an African-related subject.
   They agreed to the meeting after receiving assurances that
protesters would not be removed while their leaders were away.
   At least 70 students were in the student center, university
spokesman Robert Wartner said late Friday. The school suspended
operations at building, where students register for classes, pay
fees and apply for student aid.

<TEXT>
   Albert Bonnier Jr., the head of a
family empire that has dominated Sweden's newspaper and publishing
businesses for decades, died Saturday, a news agency reported. He
was 81.
   The report by the Swedish national news agency TT said Bonnier
died after an unspecified illness. It did not say where he died or
give a cause of death.
   In the early 1950s, Bonnier founded AB Bonnierforetagen, a
diversified, international company. He served as managing director
from 1959 to 1981 and chairman of the board until January, when his
younger brother Lukas took over.
   Albert Bonnier saw himself mainly as a publisher and was
chairman of the board at the Bonnier-controlled publishing house
Ahlen &amp; Akerlund until 1982.
   The Bonnier family also has major holdings in Sweden's major
morning paper the Dagens Nyheter, where Bonnier was chairman of the
board for years, and the widest circulated daily in Scandinavia,
the evening paper Expressen.
   The family's tradition in publishing stretches back to 1837 when
the publishing house Albert Bonnier's Forlag was founded.

   A Roman Catholic bishop told
mourners at the funeral of a slain priest Saturday that the
military is persecuting the church and President Corazon Aquino is
ignoring its abuses.
   The Rev. Antonio Tobias, bishop of Pagadian diocese, made the
charge during the funeral of Rev. Dionisio Malalay. He was gunned
down April 6 in the nearby Mindanao island town of Tabina along
with Rufino Rivera, a town councilman.
   Police say they were slain by a soldier and an anti-communist
militiaman, both of whom were drunk.
   Priests say the killings illustrate the abuses suffered by
civilians at the hands of an unruly military. Military officials
say the two victims were killed during an argument and that the
case had nothing to do with politics.
   The military faces insurgencies by both Communist and Moslem
guerrillas on Mindanao island. In December, Amnesty International
reported a ``pattern of torture'' and human rights violations by
military and paramilitary units as part of their campaign against
communist rebels.
   Tobias said nine priests and lay workers have been slain in the
Philippines since 1987. He said church officials in this
predominately Roman Catholic country have suffered harassment and
intimidation through ``propaganda, lies and threats to their very
lives.''
   He claimed the military had branded human rights activists,
priests and social workers as communists on flimsy evidence. Such
people ``can be summarily executed by military forces,'' he said.
   ``It becomes relatively clear why we consider ourselves to be
living in a period of church persecution in the Philippines,'' he
said during the services in this Mindanao island community 470
miles south of Manila.
   Constable 2nd Class Sabino Colipano, a member of the 462nd
Philippine Constabulary company, and his cousin Nelson Colipano, a
member of a local civilian militia unit, have been arrested in the
killings. The charges were brought at the urging of local church
officials.
   The bishop said he would write Mrs. Aquino, a Catholic, urging
her to order an investigation.
   ``While President Aquino is being made more and more aware of
the terrible human rights record of her government, she does not
seem to fully accept the reality,'' the bishop said.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's easing of the reins that kept
the Soviet Union's 15 republics under Moscow's strict control for
decades has released pent-up anger. The central government's new
tolerance has resulted in demonstrations, strikes and political
moves unheard of before Gorbachev came to power in 1985.
   Here is a list of some of the ethnic hotspots in the Soviet
Union:

   The republic of Georgia is a major resort area and the fruit and
vegetable basket of the Soviet Union. About 70 percent of the 5.3
million people are Georgian. Among minority ethnic groups, 9
percent are Armenian, 7 percent Russian, 5 percent Azerbaijanis and
1.7 percent Abkhazian.
   Abkhazia is an ``autonomous republic'' under the authority of
Georgia. Abkhazians comprise just 15 percent or 91,000 of its total
population of 505,000, and they are outnumbered by both Georgians
and Russians in their homeland.
   Georgian activists want to break away from the Soviet Union.
   Abkhazians complain that Georgians interfere with their national
life. They want to secede from Georgia and become a 16th republic
of the Soviet Union. Some Georgian activists oppose the Abkhazians'
secession demands.

   Nagorno-Karabakh is an ``autonomous region'' surrounded by and

Nagorno-Karabakh to the republic of Armenia.

   The three Baltic states _ Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia _ were
provinces of czarist Russia before World War I and independent
nations between the world wars. They became part of the Soviet
Union in 1940, but this incorporation has not been universally
recognized.
   Movements in all three have been calling for autonomy.
   The Baltic republic of Estonia on Nov. 16 issued a ``declaration
of sovereignty'' from the central Moscow government in all areas
but defense and foreign policy. It also approved an amendment to
the republic's constitution requiring Estonian approval of all new
Soviet laws.
   Lithuania declared Lithuanian its official language and restored
the flag of the state that was independent before World War II.

   After months of campaigning, Dick Martin
still needed a lucky draw of the cards to win another term as
village president.
   Martin turned up the king of hearts at Thursday night's Village
Board meeting to win a deadlocked race.
   His challenger, Mike Hayes, drew the jack of hearts but vowed to
seek a recount.
   He didn't mention a reshuffle.
   ``I felt very uncomfortable choosing a card to fill a government
position,'' Hayes said. ``I don't agree with it, but it's the law.''
   Martin and Hayes both received 97 votes in the April 4 election.
Under state law, the winner was to be determined by lot.
   ``I've been the clerk for 35 years and this is the first time
we've had a tie for anything like this,'' said Joyce Krueger.
   Martin, village president for four years, said after his
victory: ``Every vote counts, as this situation testifies. Let's
get back to work.''

<HEAD>Customs Holds Printing Press For Unofficial Journal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A British religious activist said Saturday that
Soviet customs officials have impounded a printing press that he
attempted to bring into the Soviet Union for an unofficial
Christian publication.
   The Rev. Dick Rodgers of Birmingham, England, said the small
offset press that he brought to the Soviet Union on Friday was
being held at Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport pending a decision by
the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
   The importation of the press for former political prisoner
Alexander Ogorodnikov's Bulletin of Christian Opinion would help in
the publishing of private journals that have sprung up in the freer
atmosphere fostered by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms.
   Three former political prisoners _ Ogorodnikov, Lev Timofeyev
and Sergei Grigoryants _ used carbon paper and manual typewriters
when they started publishing two years ago. They have since
imported microcomputers and have gained access to tightly
controlled photocopy machines.
   Timofeyev publishes the journal Referendum, and Grigoryants
publishes Glasnost. Dozens of others publish smaller and more
limited journals.
   Officials refuse to recognize their publishing activities, and
the private publishers have no access to state-run printing
facilities.
   ``I think it is vitally important that people should be free to
publish religious literature,'' Rodgers said in a telephone
interview from Ogorodnikov's editorial office. ``If there is no
freedom to do that, then any freedom is very partial.''
   He said he decided to try to import the press, which can produce
several thousand printed sheets per hour, to test Soviet compliance
with agreements signed in Vienna earlier this year on security and
cooperation in Europe.
   Rodgers quoted the documents as saying the agreement ``allows
individuals, institutions and organizations, while respecting
intellecutal property rights including copyright, to obtain,
possess, reproduce and distribute information material of all
kinds.''
   He said Soviet customs officials took custody of it and said
they would hold onto it until they received permission to release
it from the Internal Affairs Ministry, Rodgers said.
   Rodgers said he planned to press Soviet officials in Moscow this
week for release of the press.

<TEXT>
   Afghan soldiers, jets and helicopter
gunships battled Moslem insurgents on Saturday, one day after the
anniversary of an accord aimed at bringing peace. The government
said at least 48 people were killed.
   President Najib accused the U.S.- and Pakistan-backed
guerrillas, who have been fighting the pro-Soviet government for a
decade, of stepping up attacks since the Geneva Accords were signed
in 1988.
   Intense fighting broke out along the Salang Highway, a key
supply route running north to the Soviet border from Kabul.
   Dozens of jet fighters and helicopter gunships were seen flying
toward the surrounding mountains, and tanks and other military
vehicles raced northward.
   Government soldiers at a checkpoint about 10 miles north of
Kabul said guerrillas hit an armored personnel carrier. They did
not know whether anyone was killed.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said fighting
near Kabul killed 43 guerrillas, three government soldiers and two
civilians. He said 19 civilians were injured.
   Guerrillas have fired 12 rockets into the city of 2.25 million
people since Friday, Amani said.
   Fierce fighting also was reported in the southern garrison town
of Khost, he said, but there were no casualties.
   His statements could not be independently verified.
   The guerrillas had cut off the Salang Highway more than a week
ago, but a convoy of about 100 trucks broke through the blockade
Friday and brought food and fuel to the capital.
   Also Friday, government forces dislodged guerrilla forces who
had blocked another supply route leading to the eastern city of
Jalalabad, which has been under guerrillas siege since March 6.
   Najib, in a 45-minute speech to members of the Cabinet,
Politburo, Central Committee, religious leaders and diplomats,
accused Pakistan and the United States of violating the Geneva
Accords and said one result could be ``regional conflict.''
   The U.N.-mediated agrement was signed April 14, 1988 by Pakistan
and Afghanistan, with the United States and the Soviet Union acting
as guarantors. The accords cleared the way for the final pullout of
Soviet troops on Feb. 15 and called on Pakistan and Afghanistan to
stay out of each other's internal affairs.
   The guerrillas were not part of the negotiations and vowed to
keep fighting to overthrow Najib's government.
   ``Today, precisely two months have elapsed since the complete
withdrawal of the Soviet forces from Afghanistan. But the war,
intervention and armed aggression are continuing with an intensity
unprecedented during the past 10 years,'' said the 43-year-old
leader.
   Afghanistan has repeatedly accused Pakistan of armed
interference and violating the U.N.-mediated accords.
   The U.N. Good Office Mission to Afghanistan and Pakistan, set up
to investigate the claims, has acknowledged violations but declined
to say by which country.
   Najib said his government had pursued a ``humane and Islamic
policy of national reconcilation,'' declaring unilateral
cease-fires and presenting proposals for dividing and sharing state
power.
   ``They stubbornly rejected any kind of political settlement,''
he said.
   During the past year, Najib said, guerrillas fired 432,730
rockets, cannons and other weapons on Afghan cities, killing 2,222
civilians and wounding 13,776.
   He said 35,927 guerrillas had been killed and another 17,547
guerrillas wounded. He gave no estimate of how many solders had
been killed or wounded.
   He also said the fighting had destroyed more than $400 million
worth of property.
   ``We could have avoided these losses. Our conscience is clean,''
Najib said. ``The responsibilty ... should lie on the shoulders of
those who are making use of the war as a means of living and
ensuring personal interests. Their hands are soaked in the blood of
innocent people.''

<HEAD>Italian Court Convicts Six In Murders, Lets off Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALERMO, Sicily (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury on Saturday ended a Mafia trial of
121 people by convicting six men of murder but acquitting a
defendant identified as the former leader of Sicily's most powerful
mob family.
   The jury also convicted 33 other people and acquitted 81 others.
   It was Palermo's third mass trial involving the Mafia. The first
and largest of the so-called ``maxi'' trials ended in 1987 with
convictions of 338 of the 456 defendants.
   One of those acquitted Saturday was Michele ``the Pope'' Greco,
who is already serving time on another conviction and has been
identified by prosecutors as the former head of the Corleone
family. The group is considered as the most powerful Mafia clan on
the island.
   Saturday's acquittals suggested that the jury, which included
the judge, did not accept prosecutors' allegations that six murders
in question were ordered by a ``cupola,'' or executive commission,
of the Mafia. Prosecutors said Greco led that group.
   The charges were based in large part on testimony from a top
Mafioso-turned-informer, Tommaso Buscetta. His accounts helped
convict Greco and other leading Mafia figures in earlier trials.
   The new convictions came after 10 days of deliberation in the
nearly yearlong trial at Palermo's criminal court. The six men were
sentenced to life in prison.
   The mass trials grew out of an investigation into the 1982
slaying of Gen. Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa. He was gunned down with
his wife and bodyguard three months after he was sent to Sicily to
lead the nation's fight against the Mafia.
   Greco is serving a life sentence since his conviction in the
first trial for ordering the general's assassination.
   The trial that ended Saturday covered other murders, including
that of a local politician shot to death with a companion outside
Palermo in 1982.
   Investigators say Greco has now been replaced by Salvatore Riina
as leader of the Corleone family.
   Riina and his top lieutenant, Bernardo Provenzano, both
fugitives for decades, were tried in absentia in the latest trial
and acquitted of the murders.
   Also acquitted was Pippo Calo, another previously convicted
Mafia boss. His nickname, ``The Cashier,'' reflected his alleged
handling of profits from the mob's multimillion-dollar drug
trafficking.
   In Saturday's verdict, the 33 other people were convicted on
charges including drug trafficking and Mafia association. Six of
them were sentenced to between 14 and 22 years in jail, and the
rest face terms of up to nine years.
   During the trial, three of the original defendants died.

   The ethics case against House Speaker Jim
Wright moves from behind closed doors into an open and far more
political arena this week as the committee investigating him
releases its final report and the Texas Democrat begins to return
fire.
   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, better
known as the ethics committee, is scheduled to make public on
Monday the voluminous report on its 10-month inquiry, along with a
formal charge that the speaker violated House rules in several
dozen instances.
   The report is expected to present in a detailed, prosecutorial
style evidence that led the panel to believe Wright improperly took
some $100,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth business associate who had
a direct interest in legislation before Congress, and skirted
limits on outside income by encouraging bulk sales of a book he
wrote.
   Wright has asked that he be allowed to appear before the
committee quickly _ perhaps within the week _ to begin his defense.
He is relying on committee rules that require a relatively low
threshold of evidence to formally accuse a member of Congress, but
a much higher level to conclude guilt.
   On one level, the case then moves into a judicial-like process
that could lead to a trial or sorts with the ethics panel sitting
as the jury.
   But the battle will be fought on the public stage as well, with
Wright arguing his innocence before colleagues and on television.
   Wright's primary constituency as speaker, the 260 members of the
House Democratic Caucus, are split between those who seem to relish
the certain political warfare to come and those who believe the
battle is already lost and wish the speaker would bow out and save
them the agony.
   ``I don't think Wright should stay as speaker,'' Rep. George
Brown, D-Calif., told The Press-Enterprise of Riverside, Calif. The
speaker's actions set a poor example for a leadership figure, he
said, adding that resignation would ``reduce the vulnerability of
the Democratic Party on grounds of ethics violations.''
   Wright was in an upbeat and relaxed mood as he stood in the
sunshine outside the Capitol and spoke to a colleague on Friday,
declaring himself relieved after an emotional televised speech he
delivered in his own defense a day earlier.
   But the political storm clouds were building.
   ``We haven't hit bottom yet,'' said one member of the speaker's
defense team, fellow Texas Rep. Charles Wilson. Wilson referred to
the spate of news reports certain to be spurred by release of the
committee's report this week.
   Even Wright's defenders acknowledge that _ whatever the
technical outcome of the ethics process _ the court of public
opinion is likely to judge him harshly because that public forum
allows little distinction between allegation and final disposition.
   ``The atmosphere is just terrible,'' said Rep. David Obey,
D-Wis. ``We are supposed to be maintaining a neutral view so we can
judge the evidence and act as a jury. All the partisan pressures
and other pressures are making that very difficult. Members are
asking themselves, `What are the political consequences of this?'
That is not a legitimate question.''
   Legislators who ventured to voice concern about the speaker's
ethics problems were under pressures of their own.
   Fellow Democrats came down hard on Rep. Robert Mrazek, D-N.Y.,
after he told The New York Times that Wright was unlikely to
survive the battle and added: ``For the first time, a couple of
Texans have said to me they think it's all over.'' A chastened
Mrazek declined to talk about the comments a day later.
   And Reps. Chet Atkins of Massachusetts and Bernard Dwyer of New
Jersey, the two ethics committee Democrats who voted against Wright
on the most serious count against him, were said to be under severe
pressure from colleagues in their party.
   Wright's main defense will be that the business partner who was
the source of the benefits the ethics panel deems to have been
improper gifts had no direct interest in legislative business
before Congress and never sought to lobby him. Those benefits paid
by George Mallick included free use of a condominium and car, and
an $18,000-a-year salary paid to Wright's wife, Betty.
   A more emotional issue for Wright, and perhaps an even more
potent argument with colleagues, will be that Congress has no
business judging the propriety of his wife's employment.
   Many lawmakers have spouses who work either in direct lobbying
jobs or in positions where they have clear interests in
legislation, raising the possibility those members would be
reluctant to cast stones.
   Another aspect of Wright's defense appears to be that he is the
victim of changing ethical standards in Washington. ``The rules of
the House may need changes,'' he said last week. ``If so, we should
make those changes and apply them prospectively... not
retroactively.''
   Rep. Louis Stokes, D-Ohio, a former ethics committee chairman,
said most members do not get an adequate grounding in the rules
they are supposed to live under. But he said the rules themselves
are growing more stringent, as well.
   ``I think right now there is a sense of the necessity to ensure
higher standards in ... all three branches of government,'' Stokes
said. ``We have been approaching this newer and tougher standard
for some time now.''

   The crush that killed at least 93 people at a
Sheffield stadium Saturday was Britain's worst sports disaster and
the latest in a catalogue of calamities that have hit the world's
most popular spectator sport.
   The biggest loss of life at a soccer game occurred May 24, 1964,
when rioting left nearly 300 dead and 500 injured after Argentina
beat Peru on a last-minute goal in Lima.
   Just over a year ago, on March 12, 1988, at least 93 people died
when fans fleeing a hailstorm stampeded into locked stadium exits
in Katmandu, Nepal. More than 100 were injured.
   In 1969, soccer even caused a military conflict when El Salvador
and Honduras suffered thousands of casualties in the so-called
``Soccer War,'' which began after a disputed soccer game between
the two nations.
   The worst single-incident sports disaster anywhere in the world
in recent history occurred when an estimated 604 people were killed
after stands at the Hong Kong Jockey Club racetrack collapsed and
caught fire in February 1918.
   But soccer, the sport watched by millions of spectators from
Scandinavia to South America, has born the brunt of most sports
disasters.
   On March 10, 1987, as many as 20 people were killed when panicky
soccer fans in Tripoli, Libya, fled knife-wielding ruffians and
triggered the collapse of a wall.
   Before Saturday's shocking scenes at Hillsborough stadium in
Sheffield, Britain's worst sports disaster was at Ibrox stadium in
Glasgow in Jan. 2, 1971 when 66 soccer fans died and 170 were
injured after barriers collapsed.
   Fire caused another disaster May 11, 1985, when 56 people were
killed at Bradford, in northern England. Fire, ignited by a
cigarette stub, sparked a fire in the stadium's wooden terracing.
   That was the worst year in the history of soccer's tarnished
image.
   Eighteen days later, on May 29, 1985, 39 people, most of them
Italians, were killed in a stampede by Liverpool fans at the
European Champions Cup final at the Heysel stadium in Brussels.
   As a result, English soccer clubs were banned indefinitely by
the Union of European Football Associations, Europe's governing
body. Last week, UEFA announced it would lift the ban for the
1990-91 season, pending a review next April.
   Saturday's disaster again involved Liverpool backers. But this
time, overcrowding rather than riots appeared to be the cause.

   Britain's Prince Edward arrived Saturday for a
three-day visit during which he will attend a play put on by a
British theater troupe.
   The 25-year-old son of Queen Elizabeth II will attend T.S.
Eliot's ``Murder in the Cathedral'' on Sunday.
   The play is being staged by Britain's National Youth Theater, of
which Edward is a patron. The prince also works as a theater
production assistant with composer Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really
Useful Theater Company.
   During a visit to Britain earlier this month, Mikhail S.
Gorbachev invited the queen to visit Moscow, and she accepted.
   She would be the first British monarch to visit the Soviet Union
since the 1917 revolution that overthrew the czar. Czar Nicholas
II, a cousin of the queen's grandfather, was murdered with his
family in 1918 by the Bolsheviks.

<TEXT>
   The remains of England's monasteries, ``those
bare, ruined choirs where late the sweet birds sang,'' symbolize
wounds too deep for healing even after 450 years.
   Anglican and Roman Catholic leaders have abandoned plans for a
commemorative service at Whitby, the Yorkshire port where Rome
asserted authority over the English church 13 centuries ago,
because of fears on the Catholic side that the event was something
of a celebration.
   ``We hit a seam of sensitivity which was deeper than any of us
realized and probably deeper than even the Roman Catholics knew,''
said the Rev. Ben Hopkinson, the Anglican rector of Whitby. ``In
the end they could not cope with it.''
   Hopkinson's announcement on Friday marked the end of two years
of planning for a weeklong religious festival beginning June 25,
including a commemorative service which was to be held on June 29
in the abbey ruins with Princess Anne attending.
   The Anglican bishop of Whitby, the Right Rev. Gordon Bates, said
he was saddened by the decision. ``It is very difficult to have a
service of penitence and reconciliation if the Catholics are not
prepared to be involved,'' he said.
   The Right Rev. Augustine Harris, the Roman Catholic bishop of
Middleborough, had nothing to add to the announcement, his office
said.
   ``There should be no blame attributed because the differences
were on both sides,'' Hopkinson said. ``Progress towards true
reconciliation must continue and not be diverted because of one
setback.
   ``But what this has done has illustrated very clearly that while
we have thought we were communicating with one another, we were
really still speaking different languages,'' Hopkinson said.
   ``We don't see it as something to celebrate,'' said the Rev.
A.J. Stacpoole, senior tutor at St. Benet's Hall at Oxford
University. The hall is associated with the Benedictine Abbey of
Ampleforth in Yorkshire.
   ``If you regard the Reformation in England as an act of state,
as the historian Maurice Powicke called it in line one of his book,
there was nothing noble about the destruction of the monasteries.
Asset-stripping is what it was all about,'' Stacpoole said Saturday.
   ``The martyr tradition of 200 years began at that very moment,
starting at the London Charterhouse where 18 monks went under,
along with Chancellor Thomas More and Cardinal Thomas Fisher,''
Stacpoole said.
   Fisher, who was the confessor to Henry's first wife Catherine of
Aragon, and More refused to take the oath demanded by the Act of
Succession affirming the king's supremacy over the church.
   Whitby, at the mouth of the River Esk on the Yorkshire coast,
was the scene of a decisive moment in the history of the English
church. In 664, a council convened at Whitby settled the date on
which Easter was celebrated in Britain. The question was far from
trivial, for it represented the triumph of Rome over the practices,
and the calendar, of the Celtic Christian church.
   Whitby was sacked by Danish raiders in 867 and was refounded as
a Benedictine house in 1078.
   Henry VIII split with Roman Catholicism in 1533, suppressed the
smaller monasteries three years later, and turned against the great
monasteries, including Whitby, in 1539.
   Whitby Abbey had fallen into ruins by the early 19th century,
and much of what was left was shelled by the German fleet in 1914.
Of the church built in 1222, only the front wall and the two
transepts are still standing. Nothing remains of the other monastic
buildings.
   Such holy ruins inspired William Shakespeare to write of ``bare,
ruined choirs'' _ the choir being the rear portion of the church
where monastic services were held.
   And it was from his vantage point above the ruins of Tintern
Abbey in southwestern England that William Wordsworth heard ``the
still, sad music of humanity'' and rejoiced in ``that blessed mood,
in which the burthen of the mystery, in which the heavy and the
weary weight of all this unintelligible world, is lightened.''

   A small bomb believed set by Basque
separatists exploded Saturday on a railroad track southeast of the
capital, causing slight damage but no injuries, a railroad
spokesman said.
   Police later safely deactivated a second bomb found on a railway
east of Madrid, a paramilitary Civil Guard spokesman said.
   The explosion occurred on the Madrid-Valencia track between the
stations of Villarubia de Santiago and Santa Cruz de la Zarza in
Toledo province, said Inaki Barron, a spokesman for the state-run
RENFE train company. The track was closed at the time of the blast.
   Five hours later, police deactivated a bomb on the same line in
eastern Cuenca province, said the Civil Guard spokesman, who was
not identified in keeping with regulations.
   The spokesman said the deactivated bomb consisted of 250 grams
of explosives. He said it was believed planted by the Basque
separatist group ETA.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but ETA said
Wednesday it would set off bombs on both the Madrid-Seville and
Madrid-Valencia railroad lines between midnight Wednesday and
midnight Saturday.
   RENFE suspended rail traffic on both lines after the threat. The
two lines cover 620 miles and carry about 10,000 people a day.
   RENFE put thousands of passengers on buses for the ride to
southern Seville and eastern Valencia, Barron said.
   More than 600 people have died in ETA's 21-year-old campaign to
secure independence from Spain for the three-province northern
Basque region.
   On April 4, ETA said it was suspending a three-month moratorium
on attacks on government targets following the collapse of talks
between the organization and government officials.
   On Friday, a car bomb blamed on ETA seriously injured two Civil
Guardsmen in the Basque city of San Sebastian.
   On Wednesday, ETA gunmen shot to death a policeman near Bilbao
and mailed six bombs to two ministers, a Basque official, a
military school in the Pyrenees and a Basque apartment building.
   Bomb experts deactivated four of the bombs, but two others
exploded, seriously injuring a Basque teacher and an army sergeant.

<TEXT>
   About 3,000 women gathered Saturday to
discuss the rehabilitation of survivors of the 1984 Bhopal gas
disaster and protest a legal settlement of damages decreed by
India's Supreme Court.
   The two-day convention was organized by the Bhopal Women Gas
Victims Organization, which says the $470 million settlement
decreed by India's highest court is too little.
   The government says more than 3,400 people died and at least
20,000 were injured when methyl isocyanate gas escaped from a tank
at the Bhopal pesticide plant operated by an Indian subisidary of
Union Carbide Corp., a Danbury, Conn.-based multinational.
   ``This convention is the first step to start a mass movement in
the country to fight for the rights of the gas victims,'' said
Abdul Jabbar Khan, an activist who heads the women's group.
   He predicted the convention would pass resolutions demanding a
review of the settlement and the reopening of the government's $3
billion suit against Union Carbide.
   On Feb. 14, the high court ordered Union Carbide to pay $470
million to settle all claims.
   At the convention's opening session, Dr. Sathyamala of the
Medico Friends Circle disputed the government's casualty toll for
the disaster. She said statistics collected from burial and
cremation grounds indicated at least 20,000 people died from
exposure to the gas that seeped out of the pesticide plant on Dec.
3, 1984.
   Similar claims have been made before. Given the haste with which
Hindu victims were cremated and Moslem victims were buried in
keeping with the tenets of their faiths, the precise number of
deaths may never be known.
   Dr. Sathyamala, who uses only one name, also said Bhopal's birth
rate had fallen because people who were exposed to the gas had
conception and sterility problems.
   ``The number of births has come down every year from 12,000
before the tragedy to just 7,800 now,'' she said.

   Italian Jews were allowed to take Saturday off under
a new decree by the Interior Ministry recognizing Jewish religious
holidays.
   The decree, published Thursday, says Jews who work in the public
or private sector as well as those in the military and civil
service do not have to work on their religious holidays.
   Jews who take Saturday off will in most cases have to work on
Sunday or put in extra hours on other days. Others who do not work
on their holy days follow the same practice.
   Many Italians employed in the public sector work a six-day week
that includes Saturday morning.
   The decree also instructs schools to keep in mind the Jewish
Sabbath when scheduling examinations since Jewish students do not
have to attend classes on Saturday.
   The decree was the result of talks between the Italian
government and the country's Jewish community.
   There are about 40,000 Jews in Italy, where the population of
about 57 million is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

<TEXT>
   William Attwood, an author, diplomat
and journalist who became publisher of Newsday during a career that
spanned more than four decades, has died at the age of 69.
   Attwood, who died at home Friday of heart failure, served under
Presidents Kennedy and Johnson as U.S. ambassador to Guinea and
Kenya and as special adviser on African affairs to the U.S. Mission
to the United Nations.
   Attwood worked as a correspondent for the New York Herald
Tribune from 1946 to 1949, first in Washington, then in Europe and
later in New York, where he covered the United Nations.
   He joined Collier's magazine in 1949 as European correspondent
and also wrote a nationally syndicated column, ``Dateline: Your
World.''
   Attwood worked for Look magazine from 1951 to 1961, serving as
European editor, national affairs editor and foreign editor. He
visited more than 70 countries on four continents, interviewing
such leaders as Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, Jawaharlal Nehru of
India, David Ben-Gurion of Israel and Josip Broz Tito of Yugoslavia.
   Attwood took a leave of absence in 1960 to serve as John F.
Kennedy's speechwriter during Kennedy's presidential campaign. The
following year, he was named ambassador to Guinea.
   He returned to Cowles Communications, publishers of Look, as
editor-in-chief, vice president and director in 1966. He joined
Newsday as president and publisher in 1970 and was named chairman
of the board in 1978. He retired in 1979 but continued his writing
career.
   Attwood and his wife, Simone, were among three American
journalist-couples admitted to China in the spring of 1971. His
reports included interviews with Chou En-lai and exiled Prince
Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia.
   President Carter named Attwood a U.S. delegate to the biennial
UNESCO conference in Paris in 1978; the following year he was named
to the U.S. National Committee for UNESCO.
   Attwood was born in Paris to American parents on July 14, 1919.
He graduated with honors from Princeton University in 1941,
majoring in history and politics. Attwood left Columbia Law School
to enlist in the Army in December 1941, the month the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor and brought the United States into World War
II. He served in the Middle East and the Pacific.
   He was author or co-author of several books, including ``The
Twilight Struggle: Tales of the Cold War,'' and ``Making it Through
Middle Age: Notes While in Transit.''
   Other writings appeared in The New Yorker, The Saturday Evening
Post, Reader's Digest, The Nation, The New Republic, Life, Time,
The Atlantic, Harper's and Esquire, among other publications.
   His work earned him a National Headliners Club Award, a George
Polk Memorial Award and a Newspaper Guild Page One Award.
   Attwood also lectured and taught courses in journalism at a
numerous universities, and was a member of the Council on Foreign
Relations, the Council of American Ambassadors, and the American
Committee on U.S.-Soviet Relations.
   Besides his wife, he is survived by a son, two daughters and
three grandchildren.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday in New Canaan.

   The Soviet Union strongly protested the expulsion
of a Soviet trade representative from the United States and hinted
to the U.S. ambassador in Moscow it might respond in kind, Tass
said Saturday.
   The Foreign Ministry delivered the protest to U.S. Ambassador
Jack Matlock Friday, Tass said.
   ``It was pointed out to the U.S. ambassador that the American
side would bear full responsibility for possible consequences and
that the incident remained open,'' said Tass, the official Soviet
news agency.
   On March 23, the State Department ordered Sergei Malinin, an
employee of the Soviet trade organization Amtorg, to leave the
United States. Asked if Malinin had been engaged in espionage,
State Department spokesman Charles Redman said simply he was a
persona non grata.
   Tass said U.S. authorities expelled Malinin in retaliation for
the allegedly groundless explusion by Moscow of a U.S. military
attache, Lt. Col. Daniel Francis Van Gundy, earlier in March. Van
Gundy's expulsion came a week after the arrest by the FBI of a
Soviet military attache in Washington accused by the FBI of
espionage.
   The Soviets charged Van Gundy with secretly photographing
military sites and trying to enter a closed area. Tass said U.S.
officials were given ``concrete proof of the incompatibility of the
behavior of Van Gundy and his diplomatic status.''
   Tass said Matlock was told Malinin's expulsion conflicted with
the warmer trend in Soviet-U.S. relations.

<HEAD>President Says Romania Has Nuclear Weapons Potential</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has
acknowleged publicly his country has the potential to make nuclear
weapons, according to media reports Saturday.
   Ceausescu also said Romania would ban new hard currency
borrowings now that it has repaid its $21 billion foreign debt,
according to the state news agency Agerpres, monitored in Vienna.
   ``We can produce any equipment and machinery, let us be
competitive with the best products turned out in the world,''
Agerpres quoted him as saying.
   ``In only one domain we do not want to do it _ that of nuclear
weapons. Technically, we have this ability as well, but ... we are
firmly resolved to fight against nuclear weapons,'' Ceausescu
reportedly told the Socialist Democracy and Unity Front, a
Communist-led organization.
   The statement followed unconfirmed reports that Ceausescu
mentioned Romania's nuclear capability to Hungarian Communist party
leader Karoly Grosz at an August meeting in the Romanian town of
Arad.
   The Agerpres report gave no further details of the statement on
nuclear weapons by Ceausescu, who has ruled his country since 1965.
   In a separate speech Friday concluding the three-day Communist
Party Central Committee session, Ceausescu said he will submit to
parliament a law that ``nobody should be allowed in any form to
resort to any foreign credit.''
   Such a law would put Romania on par with Albania, the only other
European nation whose laws forbid borrowing from the West.
   When he opened the session Wednesday, Ceausescu announced
Romania had paid off its foreign debt with western creditors.
   Excerpts of the speech reported by Agerpres showed Ceausescu
firmly rejecting Soviet-style reforms of Communism and announcing
plans to revise current Romanian editions of works by Karl Marx,
Friedrich Engels and Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, reporting on the Central
Committee meeting from Bucharest, said it reaffirmed controversial
plans to destroy villages in Romania and also rejected recent
Western criticism of human rights abuses in Romania.
   Ceausescu said last year that 7,000 villages might be destroyed
in a scheme to create large agro-industrial complexes in the
countryside, once the backbone of Romania's agriculture-based
economy.
   Severe food shortages have developed in recent years as the
emphasis has switched to industry, and agricultural produce was
exported to the Soviet bloc in exchange for raw materials and to
the West for hard currency.
   The hard currency was needed to pay off Romania's debt.

   The Communist Party will campaign as the
``initiator of reforms'' in parliamentary elections, its spokesman
said following a political strategy meeting on Saturday.
   Spokesman Jan Bisztyga announced 1,749 party delegates will
attend a party convention next month to approve candidates and
positions. He also said the party was considering whether members
will be allowed to join a legal Solidarity trade union.
   ``During this election campaign, we would like society to learn
more about the party as the initiator of reforms,'' Bisztyga told a
news conference after the brief party meeting. ``We would like to
prove that the party stands behind the reforms.''
   The meeting of the 230-member party Central Committee was the
first since communist authorities and the opposition agreed April 5
to hold partially free elections to parliament and restore the
legal status of Solidarity _ the Soviet bloc's first independent
trade union.
   The party's first secretary, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, opened
and closed the meeting at party headquarters, the official PAP news
agency reported.
   A brief PAP statement said the Central Committee took decisions
on the parliamentary elections and May 4-5 party conference.
   He said the party was considering whether to allow its 2.3
million members to join Solidarity. The trade movement applied for
legal registration Thursday, and it is expected to be granted
Monday.
   Jaruzelski's decision to accept a legal Solidarity was adopted
only after a stormy party meeting in mid-January.
   Legalizing Solidarity marks a reversal in the party's attitude
toward the opposition, which it had tried to eliminate for seven
years after a December 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Saturday's meeting also debated party campaign strategy in the
parliamentary elections. The elections are scheduled in two stages:
the first stage on June 4 and a runoff vote June 18.
   The elections will be the first time in the history of the
communist state that candidates can run for parliament without
first having been approved by the party.
   Under the new electoral law, the party and its allies will be
guaranteed 65 percent of the seats in the 460-member Sejm, the
present one-house parliament, with the other 35 percent to be
openly contested by independent, non-party candidates. All seats of
the new 100-member Senate are to be freely contested between
communists and independents.
   Bisztyga said the division of seats among the communist party
and its allies, the Peasants' Party and the Democratic Party, was
under discussion and would be announced before an April 25 deadline
set by the Council of State.

<TEXT>
   A repaired Concorde jet roared away from
Australia on Saturday to attempt a supersonic speed record, leaving
investigators baffled about why part of its tail tore off over the
ocean last week.
   ``There are no signs of metal fatigue,'' said British Airways
airport services manager Pat Boody. ``Engineers have crawled all
over it, replaced the tail assembly, and we still don't know why it
happened.''
   On Wednesday, the British Airways plane lost a four-by-three
foot chunk of its tail over the South Pacific while setting a speed
record from Christchurch, New Zealand. Though the 100 American
passengers aboard felt a shudder, the crew served lunch and the
plane landed safely in Sydney with no injuries reported.
   It was traveling about 1,500 mph at the time, nearly twice the
speed of sound.
   Capt. David Leney, the pilot, said earlier in the week he was
puzzled why the Concorde lost part of its tail.
   ``We were climbing at 44,000 feet when there was a slight
bump,'' Leney said. ``I didn't know at the time we had lost part of
the rudder. I thought we must have hit something. But how can that
be at 44,000 feet? There's nothing there to hit us.''
   Despite the incident, the passengers, many of whom are wealthy,
seemed to have few worries about reboarding the in Sydney earlier
Saturday for the flight to Perth in western Australia. It made a
one-hour refueling stop and continued on to Colombo, Sri Lanka.
   The plane is on a three-week odyssey that started April 1 in
London. It is trying to establish supersonic speed records on each
of 12 legs of its around-the-world journey that ends in London on
April 23.
   The Concorde, which also performs regular commercial service,
has been used mainly on transatlantic routes.
   Boody said a seven-member repair team flew in from London and
worked around the clock so the jet could leave only one day behind
schedule for Perth and Sri Lanka.
   The Concorde completed the Sydney-Perth trip, a distance of
about 2,050 miles, in two hours, 40 minutes and 5 seconds. It
reached a maximum speed of 1,300 mph.
   ``You would be a fool to miss this,'' said passenger Tony
Misciagna, an investments broker from Altoona, Pa. Like others on
the trip, he paid $39,000 for the 38,215-mile journey.
   ``We're ... going to places we wouldn't normally go because it
usually takes so long,'' he said. ``It's got to be the best bargain
in town. I'm going to go again next year, even if its costs more.''

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak on Saturday removed
Defense Minister Abdel-Halim Abu-Ghazala, who was viewed as the
government's No. 2 man, and named him to a largely ceremonial post.
   The government described the transfer of Abu-Ghazala to the
assistant presidency as a promotion, but diplomats said it was a
demotion. They said it underscored Mubarak's control of the
government.
   The post of assistant president, now vacant, has been largely
ceremonial.
   Abu-Ghazala helped develop Egypt's strong ties with the United
States. The development took U.S. officials here by surprise, but
one Western diplomat said it should not hurt U.S.-Egyptian
relations.
   ``I understand they're in a frenzy,'' he said of U.S. officials,
``but I wouldn't have thought that the passing of Abu-Ghazala
should necessarily worry the Americans.
   ``He's very pro-American, but there are a lot of people like
that in the Egyptian forces,'' the diplomat said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The country's political system is closer to democracy than that
of almost any other Arab state, but it maintains equilibrium
through the use of police and military force. Many people have
assumed Mubarak relied on the army and generals like Abu-Ghazala as
a prop for his authority.
   ``I suppose the main significance is that Mubarak felt strong
enough to do it. He very clearly must have had the backing of the
armed forces,'' the diplomat said.
   The U.S. Embassy staff had no immediate reaction.
   The ambassador added that he had long heard rumors that Mubarak
was unhappy with Abu-Ghazala's personal and professional ethical
standards.
   But Abu-Ghazala, a 59-year-old with five children, is reported
to have taken a second wife, less than half the age of his first
after a public courtship that scandalized some Eygptians, according
to government and diplomatic sources. Moslems may take up to four
wives.
   In addition, Westerners who do business with the Defense
Ministry also speak of significant corruption.
   The last assistant president was former Prime Minister Mamdouh
Salem. He died three years ago, and the position has been vacant
since then.
   The post is separate from the vice presidency, which is also
vacant. The country has had no vice president since Mubarak
succeeded assassinated President Anwar Sadat in October 1981.
Mubarak served as vice president to Sadat from 1975 until the
assassination.
   In the last few years, there have been frequent reports and
speculation that Mubarak would promote Abu-Ghazala to vice
president. Abu-Ghazala denied the reports.
   The Defense Ministry, which Abu-Ghazala headed for eight years,
will now be operated by Maj. Gen. Youssef Sabry Abu-Taleb, 60, who
ran Cairo's government for six years as governor.
   Mubarak announced the two appointments in decrees and
immediately swore in the two men to their new posts Saturday.
   Afterward, Prime Minister Atef Sedki told reporters only that
Mubarak ``needs at his side someone to help him in the huge tasks
that he has to discharge.''
   However, government sources pointed out that Abu-Taleb, not
Abu-Ghazala, accompanied Mubarak on a trip to Jordan on Wednesday
to discuss with King Hussein his upcoming U.S. trip. The sources
said Abu-Ghazala was removed from the delegation at the last minute.
   Abu-Ghazala, 59, served as military attache in Washington
between 1976 and 1979. He was regarded as a prime player in forging
Cairo's special relationship with the United States after Egypt
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1979.
   He was graduated from Cairo's Military Academy in 1949, but he
later attended military courses both in the Soviet Union and the
United States. He was an officer in Egypt's 1956, 1967 and 1973
wars with Israel.
   The Middle East News Agency said Mahmoud Sherif, governor of
Sharkia province, would take over as governor of Cairo.

   A bizarre sect of suspected drug
smugglers was influenced by a cult movie called ``The Believers''
about the time they began performing human sacrifices to protect
their illegal business, police said Saturday.
   The 1986 movie, starring Martin Sheen and directed by John
Schlesinger, is about rich, influential families who protect their
prominence with rites including human sacrifice.
   The motives of the movie's characters are chillingly similar to
those of the members of the real-life cult accused of sacrificing
at least 13 people on a ranch west of Matamoros, Mexico, police
said.
   ``They keep bringing the movie up,'' Cameron County Sheriff's
Lt. George Gavito said after interviewing two suspects. ``They talk
about it like that had something to do with changing them.''
   The 13 bodies were found this week on a ranch 20 miles west of
Matamoros, across the Rio Grande from Brownsville. Police said most
of the cult's victims died either from blows dealt with a machete
or a hammer.
   Some suffered horrible mutilations, including the removal of
brains, hearts and other organs that were boiled with blood in what
suspects have described as sacrificial rites of a cult seeking
magical protection for their drug-smuggling activities.
   Authorities said the gang smuggled a ton of marijuana a week
into the United States.
   Four suspects are in custody, all in Matamoros. Four others _
including a man and woman whom sect members called ``the
godfather'' and ``the godmother'' _ are at large.
   U.S. federal authorities videotaped interviews Friday with two
of the suspects in custody in Matamoros, said Oran Neck, agent in
charge of U.S. Customs in Brownsville.
   Serafin Hernandez Garcia and Elio Hernandez Rivera told the U.S.
officials the cult's ``godmother,'' Sara Maria Aldrete, recruited
them into the group early 1988, Neck said.
   Ms. Aldrete, 24, and the cult's Cuban-born leader, Adolfo de
Jesus Constanzo, 26, at first practiced a widespread Afro-Cuban
religion called Santeria, or ``the way of the saints,'' the
suspects told authorities. Santeria assigns Roman Catholic saints
with the characteristics of West African deities. Like many
religions originating among poor, farming people, Santeria
sometimes calls for the sacrifice of animals, but never humans.
   But the group's relatively benign rites turned sinister late
last summer, about the time Ms. Aldrete began urging members to
watch videotapes of ``The Believers,'' Gavito said.
   The movie did not in itself incite group members to perform
human sacrifice, Gavito said, but it reinforced their desire to
begin killing people to provide a magical shield for their alleged
drug activities.

   Hu Yaobang, an outspoken reformer who led the
world's largest Communist Party until a 1987 purge consigned him to
political oblivion, died of heart failure Saturday. He was 73.
   The protege of senior leader Deng Xiaoping died one week after
he suffered a heart attack during a meeting of the Politburo, the
ruling body that dismissed him as party general secretary two years
before.
   At Beijing University, hundreds of students put up posters
praising Hu as a reformer and indirectly criticizing those who
ousted him.
   The Chinese Communist Party he led for seven years described Hu
as a ``great proletarian revolutionary'' and ``loyal communist
fighter'' who led a glorious life with ``everlasting merits for the
party and the people.''
   But Hu suffered from his party's swift ideological shifts.
   He joined Mao Tse-tung on the 1934-35 Long March but was
targeted by Mao's Red Guards during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution, spending nearly the entire decade banished to the
countryside or under house arrest.
   Hu's political fortunes rose after Mao's death, and he helped
revive China's economy through market-oriented reforms. He once
stood on the threshold of succeeding Deng Xiaoping as the leader of
China's 1.1 billion people, but he fell from grace over 1986
pro-democracy student demonstrations.
   He was forced to resign on Jan. 16, 1987 after being blamed for
failing to put down the demonstrations. Hu, who had reportedly
alienated Deng with his outspoken manner, also was accused of
promoting dangerously high growth rates and neglecting to stop the
trend toward Westernization.
   Hu retained his seat on the powerful 17-member Politburo, but he
made no public statements and appeared ill at ease in his few
public appearances.
   He was last seen during the annual session of China's
parliament, the National People's Congress, which ended April 4.
   At Beijing University Saturday, hundreds of students milled
around posters praising Hu as a ``leading force in reform.'' One
poster referred obliquely to Hu's 1987 ouster as ``that year when
you were made to play the scapegoat.''
   ``May your spirit re-awaken to bear witness to history,''
another poster said, in an apparent call for a review of the
charges against him.
   The evening television news briefly played mournful music while
displaying a picture of Hu, then read a Communist Party statement
that praised Hu as a statesman and ``great proletarian
revolutionary.''
   The statement did not mention Hu's ouster in disgrace.
   The chain-smoking Hu, Deng's longtime bridge partner, was widely
expected to take over Deng's functions when China's senior leader,
now 84, stepped down.
   The unofficial scenario called for Hu, once he overcame the
suspicions of the conservative military, to take over Deng's posts
and become the nation's undisputed leader. Instead, former Premier
Zhao Ziyang succeeded Hu as party boss and Li Peng, who favors
economic stability over reform initiatives, became premier.
   Hu was born in November 1915 in Liuyang County, Hunan province.
According to official reports, he left home at the age of 14 to
join the Communist Party Children's Corps.
   He took part in the Long March, the Red Army's epic flight from
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist forces, and served as a political
commissar during the 1937-45 war against Japan.
   Hu became secretary of the Communist Youth League in 1952, three
years after Mao's forces took over the mainland, and in 1956 he was
appointed to the party Central Committee.
   In 1966, as head of the Youth League, he became a prime target
of Mao's Cultural Revolution. Red Guards shaved his head, forced
him to crawl on his hands and knees and exiled him to rural Henan
province.
   Among his alleged crimes was that he and Deng, another victim of
the leftists, used railroad cars and special airplanes to ferry
bridge partners around the country.
   Hu was rehabilitated in 1977 and headed the party office in
charge of redressing injustice during the Cultural Revolution.
   He quickly rankled party ideologues, men who would later push
for his ouster, by criticizing Mao for his role in the Cultural
Revolution, which he described as a ``period of catastrophe'' in
which ``nothing was correct or positive.''
   He was elected secretary general of the party Central Committee
in 1980, and served as chairman of the party from June 1981 until
the title was abolished in September 1982. He then became general
secretary of the party.
   Hu had four children and five grandchildren. His wife Li Zhao is
a clothing designer and former official in the Beijing Textile
Bureau.

<HEAD>Thousands March To Support Abortion Rights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people marched through downtown
Rome Saturday to support the availability of abortion and protest
what they called restrictions in Italy's abortion law.
   State police said at least 35,000 people took part in the
demonstration, but the paramilitary Carabinieri put the number at
60,000 and organizers claimed 200,000 marched.
   Police blocked off a large area of central Rome as the
demonstrators, carrying banners reading ``We Want to Choose,''
marched along a two-mile route in intermittent rain.
   The marchers were led by women from at least eight political
parties, including Italy's second- and third-largest parties, the
Communists and Socialists.
   Many demonstrators aimed their barbs at Health Minister Carlo
Donat Cattin, a member of Italy's dominant Christian Democrat
party. An effigy carried by one group caricatured Donat Cattin as
``minister of chastity.''
   Donat Cattin has been at the center of the dispute over Italy's
1978 abortion law. It allows first-trimester abortions only in
public hospitals and permits doctors to refuse to perform the
procedure by declaring themselves conscientious objectors.
   Pro-abortion activists say women are forced to undergo dangerous
illegal abortions because too many doctors use the exemption. They
say that according to one estimate, two-thirds of Italy's doctors
have declared themselves objectors.
   Religious leaders and conservatives have joined Donat Cattin in
seeking more restrictions in the abortion law. Anti-abortion
activists say the law is being abused and that some women are
undergoing abortions in the fifth month of pregnancy.

   More than three-quarters of Americans approve of
abortion under some circumstances, according to a Gallup poll
released Saturday.
   The poll, conducted for Newsweek magazine after last week's huge
abortion rights rally in Washington, found 27 percent of those
asked said abortion should be legal without conditions, the highest
percentage since the Gallup Organization first asked the question
in 1975.
   Another 50 percent said they approved of abortion only under
certain circumstances, which were not specified in the question.
Only 18 percent of Americans surveyed believe abortion should be
illegal without exceptions.
   Fifty-one percent said they do not want the Supreme Court to
overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion.
   The Gallup organization interviewed a national sample of 750
adults on April 12 and 13. The rally was held April 9. The margin
of error is plus or minus 4 percentage points.

   Armed members of the Holy Spirit Movement
kidnapped 21 bus passengers in northwestern Uganda and forced 18 of
the victims to join the cult, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The weekly Guide said its report was based on interviews with
three victims who were abducted but then released.
   The Holy Spirit Movement is one of at least 10 rebel groups
fighting to overthrow President Yoweri Museveni.
   According to the Guide, the rebels attacked the bus on March 29
and led the passengers into the bush. It said the three released
included a pregnant woman, the mother of a sick child and a person
with a physical disability.
   The three said the 18 others were forced to undergo rigorous
military training, the newspaper reported. One of the prisoners is
an employee of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and he
was forced to work as an information officer, according to the
Guide.
   The Holy Spirit Movement was started in 1986 by
warrior-priestess Alice Lakwena, who fled into Kenya in 1987 after
her followers suffered heavy losses in battles with government
forces.
   Remnants of the cult have regrouped in northern Uganda, and they
raid villages for food, medicine and new members.
   Members have been taught to believe that smearing their bodies
with oil makes them impervious to bullets.

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Libya on Saturday denounced the United States and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III for criticizing Libya's
acquisition of Soviet fighter-bombers.
   An article by the political editor of Libya's official JANA news
agency said:
   ``If Baker deplores the possession by Jamahiriya (Libya) of some
equipment it needs to exercise its self-defense, how does he
justify his government's supply of a very advanced arsenal of
military equipment to the Zionist enemy (Israel), used in attacking
the Palestinian Arab people and disturbing the stability of the
whole region... ?''
   It said Libya has ``reasserted its clear stance rejecting all
forms and types of terrorism, and world public opinion ... no
longer believes such fabricated accusations promoted by hostile
forces either through their statements or leaked reports.'' The
report was monitored in Rome.
   U.S. officials have said the Soviets supplied Libya with up to
15 Sukhoi fighter-bombers capable of threatening Egypt and possibly
Israel.
   But Soviet officials said no more than six such planes were sent
to Libya and they are defensive aircraft.
   The JANA article made no mention of U.S. air raids three years
ago on the Libyan cities of Tripoili and Benghazi. The Reagan
administration said the bombings on April 15, 1986 were carried out
because Libya supports international terrorism.

   Father Damien de Veuster, who
ministered to lepers on this remote peninsula a century ago, was
remembered Saturday by hundreds still moved by his compassion for
society's outcasts.
   Some flew in by airplane and others hiked down imposing cliffs
that isolate the Kalawao Hansen's Disease settlement on Molokai
Island to participate in ceremonies marking the centennial of the
Belgian priest's death.
   Guests including Prince Philippe of Belgium, Hawaii Gov. John
Waihee and members of the de Veuster family from Tremeloo, Belgium,
gathered at St. Philomena Church, better known as ``Father Damien's
Church.''
   Damien came to Hawaii in 1873 and served at Kalaupapa for 16
years before dying of Hansen's Disease, or leprosy, at the age of
49. He not only attended to spiritual needs, but treated patients
and helped construct houses and churches for the settlement.
   The Catholic Church has been declared Damien ``venerable,'' one
of the final phases in the process culminating with elevation to
sainthood.
   ``He was the face, the voice and the light of hope for the
hundreds of the abandoned banished to this remote place by terror
of what was then a loathsome disease,'' Waihee said.
   Prince Philippe said Damien helped bring the ``heartbreaking
physical and moral misery'' of Hansen's Disease to world attention.
   The windswept peninsula, bounded by 1,600-foot cliffs and rough
seas, is still home to about 90 Hansen's Disease patients. The site
is now a national park.

   Police arrested nearly 600 demonstrators who blockaded women's
clinics in four states Saturday, apparently as part of a national
campaign to persuade the Supreme Court to make abortion illegal.
   The protestors in Milwaukee; Ann Arbor, Mich.; Jackson, Miss.;
and Tampa and Melbourne, Fla., were dragged off by police after
blocking the entrances to clinics.
   The protests appeared timed to sway the court, which is due
April 26 to consider a challenge to the landmark Roe v. Wade
decision legalizing abortion. A week ago, more than 300,000
abortion rights supporters marched in Washington.
   The Tampa Women's Health Center was blocked for about three
hours before officers moved in to make arrests, said Hillsborough
County sheriff's spokesman Jack Espinosa. He said 187 of the
estimated 1,000 demonstrations were detained.
   Protesters temporarily blocked a section of the street in front
of the clinic near the University of South Florida, Espinosa said,
but police had ``no problem'' making the arrests. The detainees
were transported to a nearby junior high school for booking on
trespassing charges.
   Robin Kennedy, administrator at the Aware Woman Clinic in
Melbourne, said the clinic entrance was blocked in the morning, but
patients ``were not intimidated by the bullies on our doorstep.''
   Police made from 130 to 150 arrests. Ms. Kennedy estimated the
crowd at 250 to 300 people but Operation Rescue, the national
umbrella group that has been organizing the protests, said about
500 people showed up.
   About 200 Milwaukee protesters lined up before 8 a.m. at a
downtown building that houses the Affiliated Medical Services
clinic, and kept workers and patients from entering.
   Each time small groups of protesters crossed police lines and
were arrested, another group would head for the entrance, where in
turn they were handcuffed and taken away. Police said 130
demonstrators were cited for trespassing, which carries a $79 fine.
   About 60 protesters were arrested in a protest Friday at the
same building.
   ``The longer we're here, the longer the clinic stays closed and
the more time the women have to reconsider their decision,'' said
Jan Parshall, a protest spokeswoman.
   About two dozen abortion rights demonstrators gathered across
the street and chanted ``Haul 'em Away'' as police made the arrests.
   Richard Withers, a spokesman for Planned Parenthood of
Wisconsin, said pro-choice supporters want to make sure that news
stories about abortion protests note there are people on the other
side of the issue.
   In Jackson, protesters arrived before 7 a.m. at two women's
clinics and blocked entrances, police said. Fifty-six protesters
were released after being charged with disorderly conduct and
trespassing.
   About 75 demonstrators were arrested in an anti-abortion
protests in Ann Arbor, police said.

   A writer on Saturday alleged that authorities told
hospitals to expect casualties before they broke up a
pro-independence rally in Soviet Georgia. She said soldiers used an
unidentified chemical in the bloody clash.
   A group of intellectuals who heard the writer's account of the
April 9 clash immediately called for the firing of senior police
and KGB officials.
   The writer, Galina P. Kornilova of Moscow, said she was in the
Georgian capital of Tbilisi for the week of protests and gathered
information from witnesses.
   She said hospitals were told to prepare for casualties two hours
before the soldiers began to forcibly clear out demonstrators.
   Georgian officials have said they did not expect fatalities when
they ordered an end to the rallies in downtown Tbilisi.
   Officials said 19 people died in the April 9 clash, but Georgian
nationalists have put the death toll at up to 50.
   Ms. Kornilova also said three people died from the spraying or
injection of a chemical. Dr. Mirab Urushadze at the Central
Republican Hospital in Tbilisi confirmed in a telephone interview
that a number of people had been hospitalized from the effects of
the unknown gas but said he knew of no deaths.
   Western reporters have been barred from Georgia since the
troubles began, and it was not immediately possible to verify
independently the charges made at Saturday's meeting of the
Moskovskaya Tribuna, a group of reformist intellectuals.
   In Italy, a front-page editorial in the Vatican newspaper
L'Osservatore Romano said the Soviet response to the demonstrations
was tragic and that no government had the right to oppress
minorities.
   Historian Leonid M. Batkin, who led the Tribuna meeting,
responded to Ms. Kornilova's allegations by demanding an
investigation.
   He also called for the dismissal of Politburo member Viktor M.
Chebrikov, who directs the legal system; the defense and interior
ministers and the head of the KGB.
   Georgia's Communist Party and government leaders took
responsibility for the violence and were replaced Friday.
   The Tribuna planned a demonstration in Moscow Sunday to demand
the investigation and dismissals.
   The group was visibly shaken by Ms. Kornilova's report that
soldiers allegedly chased down fleeing protesters to attack them
with sharpened shovels, clubs and chemicals.
   ``A woman doctor who rushed to rescue the children was killed,''
Ms. Kornilova said. ``Then they broke into the ambulance and pulled
out a wounded person and beat him to death. They ran after those
who fled.''
   Soviet media have provided few details of the clash other than
the official death toll.
   Ms. Kornilova said more than 100 parents have complained to
police that their children disappeared after the confrontation.
   She said she heard the Georgian health minister say three people
died from the poison and that others were dying.
   A worker at the Georgian Ministry of Health contacted by phone
said she was not competent to say whether demonstrators had died
from exposure to gas.
   Dr. Urushadze said ``there are people who are ill, physically
sick, from gas. We don't know how many there are, as some register
and others don't.'' He said the soldiers used spray cans or
capsules.
   Within hours of the clash, Tbilisi residents contacted by
telephone said the troops had used tear gas on the protesters.
   Once the soldiers attacked, youths formed a front line of those
who knew karate and veterans of the war in Afghanistan.
   The streets of the Georgian capital were reported quiet
Saturday, but the military newspaper Red Star said police vehicles
had been pelted with rocks and bottles. The evening news showed a
mass of flowers spread on the site of the confrontation.
   Tengiz Grigorashvili, a journalist for the official Gruzinform
news agency, said by telephone that separate funerals were being
held for some victims.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.

<TEXT>
   Hungary's leading communist reformers
met Saturday for an unprecedented debate on the future of the
governing Communist Party and a possible split.
   The meeting came three days after the Communist Party shuffled
the leadership of its ruling Politburo.
   Imre Pozsgay, one of the most prominent reformers, told some 600
people at the meeting that a split in the party would mean its
demise. But others said the party might be ineffective without a
drastic change.
   There had been speculation before Wednesday's shakeup in the
Politburo that the reformers might break with the party.
   Pozsgay said a multiparty system is ``unavoidable'' and the
Communist Party must take the lead in solving social and economic
problems if it wants to compete.
   ``Let's endeavor to account for our deeds before we are called
to account,'' he said.
   According to published reports, many of the thousands of people
who have left the party in the past year were dissatisfied with the
slow pace of reforms.
   Reszo Nyers, a reformer and a Politburo member, said sweeping
economic changes such as the introduction of market forces are
crucial but they could not be achieved by a single party, ``even if
it is a reform party.''
   Pal Vashtag, a reformer who became a member of the Politburo on
Wednesday, told journalists that a split in the party would be
``highly unfortunate.''
   During the debate, however, some participants advocated a split.
   ``Enforced unity only paralyzes the effectiveness of the party,
which forces it to make compromises and make effective leadership
impossible,'' said Csaba Gombar, a political scientist.
   Two speakers who received strong applause were Laszlo Lengyel
and Mihaly Bihari, both expelled from the party a year ago.
   Lengyel said ``Hungarian society will simply bypass the ...
party if it continues to avoid the hard decisions.''
   Bihari said procedures for a multiparty system must be
established as soon as possible.

<HEAD>U.S. Marshals and Navy Blocked by Vieques Residents Over Eviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIEQUES, Puerto Rico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of residents of Vieques
Island camped out Saturday around the house of a family ordered to
leave land that the U.S. Navy claims is federal property.
   Two Navy vehicles were burned Friday when about 100 neighbors of
Carmelo Felix Matta blocked an attempt by three U.S. marshals to
enforce an eviction order. No injuries were reported.
   The Navy claims Felix Matta, an unemployed veteran living on a
Veterans Administration pension, and his family are ``unauthorized
occupants'' of land within the boundaries of Camp Garcia, located
on Vieques Island.
   The 32-square-mile island is off the east coast of Puerto Rico.
   Lt. Richard Boyle, a spokesman for Navy operations in the
Caribbean, said Saturday the Navy has been trying to get Felix
Matta and an unspecified number of other families off the land
since 1985.
   The San Juan Star newspaper said that when Felix Matta refused
the marshals' order to leave on Friday, the officers called for
assistance from the Navy.
   Eight sailors arrived in two trucks and began loading the
vehicles with items from Felix Matta's house. Area residents then
blocked the road, and someone threw gasoline on the trucks and set
them afire, the newspaper said.
   The residents returned many of the family's belongings to the
house, according to the newspaper.
   A person at the scene Saturday said the Matta family remained in
the house and dozens of residents were camped out at the site in
case of another eviction attempt.
   Charles Connelly, publisher of The Vieques Times, a monthly
newsletter, said the Felix Matta house is about two miles from the
entrance to Camp Garcia and about 2,000 feet from the fence
surrounding the base.
   He said the Navy contends that although the house is outside the
fence, it is in a buffer zone established in 1985 between the fence
and civilian property.
   ``Recently the Navy began hanging signs in front of houses, some
of which are businesses, saying they are on U.S. federal
property,'' Connelly said.
   He said Felix Matta has been on the land since at least 1976.
   Two-thirds of Vieques Island, located between Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands, is owned by the Navy. The U.S. military
uses a large section as a bombing and gunnery range.
   There have been sporadic protests of the Navy presence and
bombing range. In the early 1980s commercial fishermen defied the
Navy and entered restricted waters during military maneuvers.
   About 7,000 people live on Vieques, and many are fishermen.

   A bronze sculpture by 17th century Italian artist
Francesco Susini, ``The Kidnapping of Helen by Paris,'' sold at
auction Saturday for $3.3 million, more than double the amount that
had been expected.
   The sculpture, completed in Florence in 1627, was once in the
collection of Jean-Baptiste Machault d'Arnouville, controller of
finances for Louis XV. It had been exhibited by his descendents at
the Chateau de Thoiry outside Paris.
   The sale was conducted by auctioneer Jacques Tajan at the Hotel
George V in Paris. The purchaser was not identified.
   The sculpture is 27{ inches high and portrays standing male and

<HEAD>New Election Law Announced</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMMAN, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   King Hussein on Saturday approved a new
election law that cancels representation in the Jordanian
Parliament for the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a government source
said.
   The action builds on Hussein's decision last July to renounce
sovereignty over the West Bank in favor of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   Jordan ruled the West Bank until 1967, when Israel captured the
territory during the Middle East war. Both Israel and the United
States have suggested Jordan should play a role in the West Bank as
part of any Middle East peace settlement.
   The new election law came days before Hussein's scheduled trip
to the United States. He meets with President Bush in Washington on
Wednesday.
   The law also promotes Jordan's claim to the Palestinian refugees
it has sheltered following the 1948 and 1967 civil wars by giving
them the same voting rights as other Jordanian citizens, said the
source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hussein has said that Palestinians on the East Bank of the
Jordan River who hold Jordanian citizenship have the same duties as
other Jordanians.
   About half of Jordan's 3 million people come from Palestinian
families, although most live outside the U.N.-run refugee camps.
   Previous electoral laws gave camp residents Parliament seats
based on the number of camps rather than on the number of residents.
   No date for new elections was set.
   The source said the law calls for a 72-member lower house of
Parliament. The old 60-member Parliament was suspended in 1988.

   A state trooper serving an arrest
warrant for an unpaid traffic ticket was shot dead Saturday by the
violator, who was then killed by police.
   The gunman, Ercil Layton, 62, fired at Trooper J.T. Brammer and
his partner after they entered his house around noon to serve the
warrant for three missed appearances in traffic court, police said.
   Brammer, 42, was killed and his partner, R.J. Hicks, 35, was
wounded in the upper arm, officials said. It was not immediately
clear whether the troopers returned the fire or whether Layton shot
himself.
   ``A damned traffic ticket,'' state police Lt. Perry Ferguson
said. ``It's a hell of a price to pay.''
   Hicks was in serious condition with a gunshot wound to the upper
arm at Ruby Memorial Hospital in nearby Morgantown, a hospital
supervisor said.
   ``It's my understanding that (Layton's) wife came to the door
and let the officers in,'' state police Lt. Col. G.R. Young said at
a news conference. ``They went into the house and from then on,
things got bad.''
   Brammer was found dead in a bedroom to the right of a hallway
that leads from the front door of the house. Layton was found alive
on the floor of a utility room at the end of the hallway. He died
on the way to the hospital, Ferguson said.
   Officers found a 30.06 high-powered rifle and a 32-caliber
handgun in the Layton home. Young said he did not know if the
weapons were used in the shootings.
   Police said the traffic ticket was related to an April 1988
incident in which Layton allegedly struck an unattended vehicle and
left the scene. According to the warrant, Layton missed court
hearings in January, February and earlier this month.
   The two troopers were going to take Layton to the Preston County
Courthouse to pay the fines, Young said.
   Brammer, a 16-year veteran and the father of two children, was
the first West Virginia state trooper shot to death in 10 years.

which atoms form bonds. Pick up 11th graf, ``Some of..'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two rival theories to explain recent experiments
in nuclear fusion have emerged from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, and on them may depend the vision of a society with a
limitless supply of energy.
   One theory holds that the experiments depend primarily on a
chemical reaction, rather than a nuclear one, and offer little hope
for a clean new source of electrical power.
   The other postulates that fusion is taking place and results
from the unusual properties of the precious metal palladium and
from sub-atomic behavior known as ``quantum tunneling.'' If so, it
is at least theoretically possible the process could be harnessed
for electric power.
   The first theory is the work of MIT professor Keith H. Johnson;
the second comes from his colleague, Peter L. Hagelstein. Both men,
who have been working independently, announced Friday that they
have submitted papers describing the theories to scientific
journals.
   Chemists at the University of Utah caused a sensation last month
when they said they had found a way to merge, or fuse, the nuclei
of hydrogen atoms at room temperature.
   They said they had produced nuclear fusion in ``heavy'' water,
which contains the hydrogen isotope deuterium, in a process that
generated four times more power than it used.
   Nuclear fusion, which fuels the sun and the stars, is regarded
by scientists as having enormous potential as a clean, efficient
energy source. Unlike nuclear fission, which splits atoms, fusion
leaves little radioactive waste.
   Until the Utah announcement, scientists believed temperatures
close to 100 million degrees were necessary to overcome the
electrical forces of repulsion between atomic nuclei. Laboratories
in Texas, and in Hungary and the Soviet Union say they have
duplicated the experiment. Georgia scientists initially announced
they had successfully performed it, then said they may have erred.
   In the view of Johnson, a 52-year-old materials science
professor, the conditions used in the Utah experiment permit atoms
of hydrogen and deuterium to be tightly bound together in the
crystal lattice structure of the palladium.
   The hydrogen and deuterium atoms form chemical bonds and begin
vibrating at very high frequencies, producing heat.
   ``Some of the nuclei occasionally get close enough together that
they actually fuse, but the large bulk of the heat that is produced
is not associated with the fusion,'' he said Friday.
   ``This process not being nuclear in origin means it is not a
panacea for solving the world's energy problems,'' Johnson said.
``It will not, in my opinion, be useful for large scale energy
production.''
   Hagelstein, 34, who works in MIT's Research Laboratory of
Electronics, claims to be seeking a patent for an related fusion
process, as yet untested.
   The dominant reaction in the Utah experiment, in Hagelstein's
theory, is the fusion of two deuterium nuclei, which produces
helium and releases energy that is trapped within the palladium
lattice and eventually emerges as heat.
   The theory focuses on ``quantum tunnelling,'' an explanation for
how nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces that ordinarily
keep them apart to fuse at lower energy levels than normally
expected.
   The use of this fusion energy to produce electrical energy
``with some efficiency'' seems likely, he wrote in an abstract of
his papers.
   Hagelstein theorized that the reaction is triggered by some
outside source, such as a cosmic ray. Some researchers may have
been unable to duplicate the Utah result because they have shielded
their experiments with materials such as lead that would block such
rays, he said.
   Scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in
Livermore, Calif., and at Los Alamos Laboratory in Los Alamos,
N.M., said their initial efforts to duplicate the fusion experiment
had not been conclusive.

<HEAD>Founder of Gotham Book Mart Dies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Frances Steloff, whose Gotham Book Mart was the
place to browse, work and buy books for many great American
writers, died Saturday at the age of 101.
   Miss Steloff, who celebrated her birthday on New Year's Eve,
died of pneumonia at Mount Sinai Hospital, said Andreas Brown, who
succeeded her as owner of the bookstore. She had been hospitalized
for about a week, he said.
   Miss Steloff achieved ``a small miracle,'' Brown said, in
founding the Book Mart in 1920 with very little support or backing,
and sustaining it through the Depression and World War II.
   Miss Steloff's celebrated customers included Ernest Hemingway,
James Joyce, Dylan Thomas, e.e. cummings, W.H. Auden, Gertrude
Stein, Anais Nin, John Dos Passos and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
   In a congratulatory message sent to Miss Steloff on her 100th
birthday, writer John Updike wrote, ``The Gotham Book Mart is my
favorite bookstore in North America.''
   Miss Steloff was born and reared in Saratoga Springs. Her
father, Simon Steloff, a rabbi, and her mother, Tobe, were Russian
immigrants. She was the first of their 14 children born in the
United States.
   She opened the book mart on Jan. 1, 1920, two blocks from the
present site in Manhattan's diamond district, and sold the
bookstore in 1967 to Brown, a rare book appraiser.
   The survival of Gotham was once in doubt when Miss Steloff
became involved in a legal battle over the ownership of the
bookstore's building with the American Friends of Hebrew University.
   Miss Steloff and the American Friends organization agreed to a
negotiated settlement in late February, Brown said.
   Miss Steloff is survived by her sister, Belle Sidoroff, of
Wilmington, Del., and her brother, Alex Steloff, of Saratoga
Springs.

<HEAD>Voters To Cast Ballots In Referendum On Amnesty For Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED McCULLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After months of court hearings and
public debates Uruguayans vote Sunday to uphold or cancel an
amnesty for soldiers accused of human rights violations during the
military dictatorship.
   Congress passed an amnesty law in December 1986 that would apply
to security forces, but some political and human rights groups
quickly organized to try to overturn the measure by referendum.
   In late 1987 the anti-amnesty groups submitted petitions with
634,000 signatures to the Electoral Court. The court eventually
affirmed the required minimum of 555,701 signatures, one-fourth of
the electorate at that time.
   President Julio M. Sanguinetti, elected in November 1984 after
democracy was restored following 12 years of military rule,
supports the amnesty law.
   He said nullification of it ``would be a step backward in the
process of national pacification.''
   Parties supporting the referendum say soldiers and police
accused of kidnappings, torture and killings must be tried if
democracy is to be fully re-established.
   ``The law should be annulled not only because its content is
contrary to human rights traditionally defended in our country ...
but also for the reason that it was sanctioned and promulgated
under military threat,'' the National Commission for the Referendum
said recently.
   It is estimated that 150 people were killed and more than 200
others were arrested and disappeared during the military crackdown
on suspected left-wing subversives that began in 1973. Several
thousand Uruguayans claim they were tortured after being detained
by security forces.
   President Juan M. Bordaberry, under military pressure in 1973,
gave the armed forces a free hand to act against rebels, especially
the Tupamaros guerrillas. The military took control and ousted
Bordaberry in June 1976.
   Sanguinetti took office in March 1985. He supported an amnesty
law passed by Congress that freed political prisoners and gave jobs
back to hundreds of public employees who had been fired by the
military government.
   That law excluded the security forces, and by mid-1986 about 50
cases had been filed accusing some 180 soldiers of human rights
abuses.
   Military officials made it known that they opposed the trial of
military men in civilian courts and Sanguinetti headed off a
potential crisis by pressing for an amnesty that would include the
military. Congress passed that measure on Dec. 22, 1986.
   Polls open at 8 a.m. and close at 7:30 p.m. Those who favor the
amnesty law will cast yellow ballots and those opposed will cast
green ballots.
   There are 2.3 million eligible voters and preliminary results
are expected Sunday night.

   Two weeks ago Elio Hernandez
ran his pickup through a police drug checkpoint near the U.S.
border and sped on. The young man didn't worry about police
following him; he thought he was invisible.
   ``We located the place, waited a few days and then moved in,''
said federal police commander Juan Benitez Ayala.
   Police expected to make a large marijuana bust, commonplace here.
   Instead, they ripped the mask from a nightmarish world of black
magic, sex, drug smuggling and human sacrifice.
   Twelve bodies were found Tuesday and one more on Thursday,
buried near a corral. Some had their hearts ripped out, their
genitals cut off or their brains removed. Some died of machete
blows to the head. Most died blindfolded and gagged.
   Police said they had all been killed by smugglers who believed
that human sacrifice would give them a ``magical shield'' that
would protect them from the law.
   Among the victims were a 16-year-old boy and Mark Kilroy,
missing since March when he came here during spring break from the
University of Texas.
   Hernandez, David Serna, Serafin Hernandez Garcia and Sergio
Martinez were arrested. Police on Saturday sought the alleged
ringleader, a Cuban-American ``voodoo priest'' Adolfo De Jesus
Constanzo, and a ``witch,'' Sara Aldrete.
   All four defendants blamed Constanzo, whom they called the
``padrino,'' for the murders. They claimed they had been lured into
the cult by Miss Aldrete's sexual favors. Aldrete also lured some
of the victims, they said.
   Hernandez and Serna told newsmen that Constanzo, whom they had
known for nine months, had initiated them into the occult, but they
said they did not know much about it. ``We believed sometimes and
sometimes we did not,'' said Hernandez.
   A federal agent who asked not to be identified said the group
was ``totally under the control of the Cuban. I don't think they
even knew what they were getting into.''
   ``They were told that the sacrifices would protect them from
police,'' the agent said. ``One of them told us that the padrino
told him police would not see him even if they walked by him.''
   Hernandez and Hernandez Garcia are Texas natives, born in
Mission and Weslaco, respectively, in the Rio Grande Valley just
across the border. Aldrete, a Mexican citizen, was a student at
Texas Southmost College in Brownsville.
   Two days after the checkpoint incident, police picked up Domingo
Reyes, the ranch caretaker, and asked him about activities at the
100-acre ranch just below the U.S. border. Reyes started talking
about strange happenings in the wooden shack near the main ranch
house, and how he was once told not to come close.
   On a hunch, a federal agent showed him a picture of Kilroy.
   ``I saw him at the ranch one day,'' Reyes said.
   It was all the agents wanted to know. U.S. officials had been
pressing Mexican police to find the student. Tourism from across
the border had diminished since Kilroy vanished; the case had top
priority.
   Police rounded up the suspects at the ranch and found more than
200 pounds of marijuana, but that was not what made headlines.
   In the shed was a copper caldron. In it were the remnants of a
fire and something that looked like brains. Nearby were candles and
pots containing heads of black goats and roosters.
   The four suspects led police to shallow graves where the bodies
were buried. Sergio Martinez, who volunteered information on a 13th
victim, sweated for almost two hours digging up the body Thursday
as police ignored his pleas for water.
   At Miss Aldrete's home agents found more indications of black
magic. There was a list of names with pins next to some of them.
One agent said bloodstained children's clothing was found.
   The shack was immediately dubbed the ``satanic chapel'' by
federal agents and local newspapers. Those arrested became
``Satan's children'' and ``the narco-devils.''
   Each defendant faces a maximum sentence of 147 years.
   A wave of horror swept over the community because of the crimes,
even though drug smuggling and violence are well-known in this
swashbuckling border area and smugglers' exploits are the subjects
of popular ballads.
   To many in Matamoros, a city of nearly 500,000, the slayings
were a perversion of the traditional image of the Mexican smuggler
who helped the town, sent his kids to the best schools and was
often a heavy contributor to charity and civic causes.
   People were quick to point out that the ringleader was Cuban and
that the cult bore resemblances to ``santeria,'' a Caribbean
Hispanic version of voodoo, although anthropologists said it was
actually a mixed bag. Ripping out a living person's heart, for
instance, was an ancient Aztec rite.
   ``Our smugglers do not pray to the devil,'' said one resident,
Ala Rosa Garza. ``This (witchcraft and drugs) is something
imported. It is the American influence.''

<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 anti-nuclear protesters
were arrested at the nation's nuclear testing grounds Saturday as
part of the annual ``Reclaim the Test Site'' demonstration.
   Energy Department spokesman Jim Boyer estimated that 1,500
people turned out Saturday for the ninth day of the protest at the
Nevada Test Site. The event ends Sunday.
   Boyer said 1,060 protesters were arrested, mostly on misdemeanor
trespass charges.
   They were taken by bus to the Nye County Sheriff's office in
Beatty, 55 miles away, where they were to be released after being
cited on the misdemeanor charge, Boyer said.
   ``Because of the numbers, we just decided to put security
personnel on the buses so they can write the citations while the
buses are rolling,'' Boyer said. ``The same ones that were arrested
yesterday are the ones we are taking out there there today.''
   County officials announced earlier this month they would no
longer prosecute the trespassers because of the growing number of
protests and arrests at the remote desert site.
   A total of 2,818 arrests were reported at the site last year,
including 2,065 during the 1988 ``Reclaim the Test Site'' action.
   More than 100 law officers were on hand to collect and handcuff
the demonstrators as they walked across a cattle guard raised on
the main road leading to the test site.
   The cattle guard, consisting of slats placed across the road,
has been a rallying point for protests the past eight years, and
law officers have arrested activists who crossed that point onto
test site property.
   Hundreds of protesters slipped through barbed wire fences
surrounding a section of the site, then waited on the sun baked,
windswept desert for officers to arrest them.
   Sensitive areas of the test site, where nuclear tests are
conducted, are remote and highly guarded.

   In the bright sunshine of early
spring, the cheers of English soccer fans turned to screams as a
surging crowd crushed 93 spectators to death Saturday.
   Some of the victims at the Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield
were taken away on advertising billboards used as makeshift
stretchers. Others lay motionless on the field while emergency
medical teams tried desperately to save their lives.
   One survivor numbed with shock sat in a corner of the stadium,
head in his hands.
   All around him, police gathered up clothing and belongings as
ambulances sped across the green turf, picking up bodies and taking
the injured to hospitals.
   One doctor told of ``sheer mayhem'' when he ran to help the
dying.
   ``There was one chap I went to who was clinically dead,'' Dr.
Glyn Phillips said. ``He had no heartbeat.''
   Phillips said he managed to resuscitate the fan, but ``I don't
know what the state of his cerebral function is going to be.''
   The disaster occurred when the 54,000-capacity stadium was
almost full. Police said they opened the gate to admit other fans,
fearing if they didn't there might be trouble outside.
   The move proved fatal. Inside, hundreds of spectators were
pushed against a steel mesh anti-riot fence that soon collapsed.
   ``It seemed as if it was four deep in dead bodies with people
climbing over them,'' said 22-year-old Stuart McGeagh.
   Another survivor, Gary Stanley, 20, said crowd control outside
the stadium was ``crazy.''
   ``There was complete madness and somehow the doors were
opened,'' he said. ``There were too many people in the section and
I saw some people crushed against barriers. The arrangements were
dreadful and I've still got a full ticket. I didn't even have to
show it to get in.''
   Another Liverpool fan, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said: ``It was ridiculous. They just opened the gates and waved
them in. I have two friends but I don't know what's happened to
them.
   ``I was crushed up to one of the railings and got cuts to my arm
but I was lucky to get out alive.''
   As police cleared the ground, fans wandered around aimlessly.
Huge sections of the fence had been ripped away; one section was
bent out of shape like a pipe cleaner.
   ``People were just crushing in,'' one fan told Yorkshire
television. ``There was a lad and his girlfriend and they were just
screaming. His words were `please God, help me,' and I believe the
girl died. Her face was just blue.''

<TEXT>
   Plans for a new federal prison in the
Washington D.C. area _ a major part of national drug czar William
Bennett's announced crackdown on crime in the nation's capital _
have been shelved in favor of building another prison in western
Maryland, officials said Saturday.
   ``It is no longer necessary that a facility be built in the
immediate Baltimore-Washington area. The capacity can be gained
more quickly in other ways,'' John Walters, chief of staff for
Bennett's National Office of Drug Control Policy, said Saturday.
   Bennett on Monday proposed a 700-bed Washington-area prison for
drug offenders when he unveiled plans to combat the epidemic of
drug-related violence in the nation's capital.
   ``The perception that initially came out was that there was
going to be this one facility to house all drug traffickers coming
out of the District of Columbia. It was a misunderstanding,'' said
Greg Bogdan, public information officer for the U.S. Bureau of
Prisons.
   On Friday, U.S. Bureau of Prisons Director J. Michael Quinlan
said $50 million had been earmarked to build a medium-security
prison and a minimum-security prison camp about five miles south of
Cumberland. The prison complex, housing at least 700 prisoners, is
slated for completion in the fall of 1991.
   Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton said Saturday the Cumberland
facility essentially would replace plans for the Washington-area
prison. ``As a result of the D.C. initiative a prison that was
going to be built someday is going to be built in Cumberland,'' he
said.
   Under the plan announced by Bennett, the federal Bureau of
Prisons will immediately accept 250 prisoners housed in the local
jail, a 500-bed pre-trial detention center is to be built within a
year, and a 700-bed prison was to be built in the
Washington-Baltimore area.
   Additional personnel also were to be provided for drug-fighting
efforts under the plan, which Bennett said would cost $70 to $80
million. The 700-bed prison was the most costly part of the plan at
about $50 million.

   A strong earthquake jolted a remote area of
southwestern China early Sunday, the State Seismological Bureau
said.
   It said communications were down with the area in Sichuan
province near the western border with Tibet and that it had no
reports of casualties or damage.
   The bureau said the quake struck at 5:34 a.m. near the town of
Batang, located on the Jinsha River, and registered 6.7 on the
Richter scale.
   In November a tremor measuring 7.6 on the Richter scale, 10
times more powerful than Sunday's quake, killed 730 people and
injured more than 4,000 in Yunnan province, south of Sichuan. It
was China's worst earthquake in a decade.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake
as measured by the ground motion recorded on a seismograph. A quake
measuring 6.7 is capable of causing severe damage in a populated
area. Each increase by one number on the scale means the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake registering 7 is considered a major tremor capable of
widespread, heavy damage.

   A Republican gubernatorial hopeful and
the city's Democratic mayor engaged in a political shoving match
Saturday to lay blame for layoffs that cut the city's police and
fire departments by 20 percent.
   Meanwhile, ``morale is at an all time low,'' said Fire Chief
William Neafsey.
   ``Most of them are confused, frustrated and mad,'' Neafsey said
of his workers. ``You name the negative emotion, they have it.''
   Many police officers were wearing black bands around their
badges in honor of laid-off colleagues, said Police Director Joseph
Brennan.
   Chuck Hardwick, the Assembly speaker who is seeking the
Republican nomination for governor, said he would convene an
emergency task force to investigate the finances of Elizabeth and
other communities that have asked for more state money.
   Thomas Dunn, Elizabeth's mayor for a quarter-century, has blamed
the city's budget woes on Hardwick, who has blocked an Assembly
vote on a tax package that would provide $65 million more to
distressed cities.
   Dunn on Friday laid off 67 police officers, 53 firefighters, 24
emergency medical technicians and 81 other city workers.
   ``If New Jersey were a business and the city of Elizabeth one of
its departments, Mayor Dunn would be fired,'' Hardwich said during
a news conference. ``In my opinion, he's acted with a callous
disregard for public safety.''
   Hardwick said he wanted to know why Dunn had not used the $7.1
million in distressed-cities aid released by the state to Elizabeth
last week.
   ``He's a trickster ... he's a carnival showman,'' Dunn responded
from his office at City Hall. ``I welcome him and anybody else (to
investigate), including the attorney general.
   ``How can I spend cash that I don't have,'' he said. Dunn said
the $7.1 million has been promised but not paid. ``Even if I got
it, it wouldn't be enough. ... I need $26 million more.''
   The city council last week transferred $2.1 million from the
city's garbage disposal account to prevent the layoffs, but Dunn
has said that under state law, the money cannot be switched.

   The commander of the Coast Guard said
Saturday he was ``encouraged'' by Exxon's plan to clean up of vast
stretches of oil-stained shoreline overrun by the nation's worst
oil spill.
   Meanwhile, the spill spread its tentacles in several directions,
forcing the closure of a herring fishery and raising fears that
bears would be poisoned by oil-tainted salmon carcasses in Katmai
National Park.
   Despite the grim reports, Coast Guard Adm. Paul Yost emerged
from a meeting with Exxon officials saying he was optimistic about
the firm's long-awaited plan.
   ``It appears to be a piece of work that's well thought-out,
scientifically and operationally, and I'm very encouraged,'' said
Yost, who has predicted the cleanup would extend through the summer.
   ``I don't think we're going to be back to 100 percent by this
time next year, but I think we're going to have a much bigger smile
on our faces than now,'' he said.
   He said he would not approve the 20-page plan until he had
examined it over the weekend, and thought it likely it would take
two or three weeks to fully implement it.
   ``I wish it was two or three weeks ago,' responded Dennis Kelso,
commissioner of the stateDepartment of Environmental Conservation.
Kelso, who had criticized Exxon harshly for failing to produce the
plan earlier, also attended the meeting. He said he would brief
Gov. Steve Cowper this weekend.
   Exxon spokesman Don Cornett said the company would not discuss
its plan until after Yost had fully reviewed it.
   The logistics for the cleanup will be staggering. The 44 crucial
sites selected by the state for immediate action have at least 240
miles of often rugged shoreline, and there are about 3,000 rocky
beaches tainted by oil in all.
   Meanwhile, fishing boats carried makeshift barriers toward the
oil-fouled coast of Katmai National Park, where bears emerging from
hibernation were feared to be feasting on tainted and potentially
toxic carcasses and clams.
   Shifting winds threatened to push balls of tar-like sludge
toward Homer and other Cook Inlet communities, and the herring
fishery at the north end of Kodiak Island was closed for fear of
contamination.
   Battles were waged on various fronts, some of them hundreds of
miles from where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 and
spilled 10.1 million gallons of thick crude oil.
   During the morning, Yost watched an armada of boats skim oil
from the surface of the resource-rich waters of Prince William
Sound, where the damage was worst.
   He said he wants to see the recovery operation pick up tempo so
that ``in two or three weeks we have a sizable number of people,
maybe in the hundreds, on the beach.''
   John Shannon, assistant secretary of the Army, said the Pentagon
had decided to send in additional helicopters, two amphibious Navy
``floatels'' and two Army Corps of Engineer dredges.
   The amphibious ships, due to arrive in about a week, can sleep
more than 1,000 people each _ precisely the type of support that
state officials have found lacking as they face the task of
cleaning the rocky coast.
   The National Weather Service said 15-knot southerly winds would
blow until Sunday morning at the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, moving
the oil sheen and sludge into Cook Inlet. The winds were expected
to shift to the west later Sunday, pushing the oil toward Homer,
Seldovia and other fish-rich communities on Kachemak Bay.
   In Kodiak, meanwhile, 27 fishing vessels set out or were
preparing to leave on missions to spot and stop the oil, some of
which had congealed into blobs just beneath the surface. Kodiak is
the nation's No. 1 fishing port with a catch worth $166 million
last year.
   At the north end of the port, the herring fishery near Shuyak
and Afognak islands opened at noon Saturday but was closed a few
hours later while officials assessed the threat from nearby oil.
   ``Basically we can't have even the remotest possibility of
having an oiled product leaving the state of Alaska,'' said Bruce
Erickson, a supervisor with the Department of Environmental
Conservation.
   With commercial oil-blocking booms in short supply, six ships
were outfitted with nets containing a ``curtain'' of heavy woven
fabric, said Linda Freed, a spokeswoman for the emergency center in
Kodiak. They hoped to capture oil off Katmai National Park and
steer it toward currents that would carry it away from land.
   ``It's a long shot, but at least we're trying,'' Ms. Freed said.
   Oil has been washing up at Kenai Fjords National Park for more
than a week and was reported on shore Friday at Katmai, situated in
the stormy Shelikof Strait some 300 miles from the spill site.
   The main ribbon of oil, which defiled thousands of rocky beaches
in the sound, has drifted 225 miles southwest to the tip of the
Kenai Peninsula.
   At Homer, 200 residents built booms in hopes of blocking the
oil, said Ray Springer, the local boss for a contractor working for
Exxon.
   But one of the greatest fears was for wildlife at Katmai
National Park, where huge brown bears feasting on salmon are as
much a tourist draw as the volcanic Valley of 10,000 Smokes and the
15 active volcanoes lining the Shelikof Strait.
   A 40-square-mile slick floated off the north edge of the Katmai
coast, and oil washed up near the Big River, where observers from a
plane saw a bear digging clams from the stained sand, said Park
Service spokesman John Quinley.
   ``We've seen pictures of dead deer in Prince William Sound that
ate oil-tainted kelp, and it looks like we could be seeing brown
bear meeting the same fate,'' Quinley said.
   ``Right now the bears are coming out of their dens,'' said Ray
Bane, park superintendent. ``The boars are first to emerge, and
they'll be followed in a week or 10 days by the sows with cubs.''
   Because ice and snow still cover much of the area, many of the
bears head directly for the beach to forage, ``looking for
carcasses, seaweed, clams, whatever else they can come up with,''
Bane said.
   ``We're concerned about the direct impact _ the physical
presence of oil on the shore, and the bears getting into it.
   ``But we are perhaps more concerned about those animals that may
be killed elsewhere by this spill and wash up on shore _ otters,
sea birds, anything that's being killed _ and the bears have no way
to distinguish these from good food.''
   Ocean currents probably will carry dead animals from all over
the region to the Shelikof area, Bane said.

<HEAD>Former Northrop Worker Appalled By Shoddy Work On Cruise Missiles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Northrop division that made electronic
guidance components for cruise missiles was a place where getting
along meant going along with incompetence and shoddy work, a former
employee says.
   Florence Castaneda was one of three former Northrop employees
whose repeated complaints finally got the attention of federal
investigators, resulting in charges filed last week.
   She said she was motivated by her worries over nuclear weapons
with bad guidance systems which ``could be the start of World War
III,'' the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.
   Castaneda, a senior assembler technician certified by the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for a variety of
electronics work, said her struggle has left her feeling alienated
and mistrustful of the aerospace industry.
   From the day she started work at Northrop's Western Services
Department in El Monte in October 1983, Castaneda said she was
appalled.
   She saw employees in an electronics ``clean room'' smoking
cigarettes, eating lunch at work stations and watching soap operas
on televisions, she told the Times.
   Northrop Corp. and five current and former employees were
indicted Tuesday on charges of conspiring to defraud the government
in assembling part of the Air Force's cruise missile guidance
system and a component for the Navy's Harrier jet fighter.
   Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said Saturday that the company
acted on complaints about the plant two years ago.
   ``We fired the plant manager and three other employees in
1987,'' Cantafio said. ``And in December '87, we shut the plant
down. That is action that we took when it came to our attention.''
   The indictment charged that Northrop and the five, including
Castaneda's boss, conspired to install parts for the cruise missile
Flight Data Transmitter that failed to meet government
specifications.
   The terrain-hugging cruise missile, one of the most versatile
weapons in the U.S. arsenal, is capable of carrying either a
conventional or nuclear warhead.
   Castaneda said she began by complaining to her superior, Charles
Gonsalves, one of those who was fired and who was named in the
Tuesday indictment. Among her complaints was the lack of coding for
component wires, a standard procedure in the aerospace industry to
trace their origin.
   ``When I started to raise concerns, Mr. Gonsalves told me that
if I just did my work like everybody else, we would get along,''
Castaneda told the Times.
   But a nephew in the Air National Guard arranged a meeting with
agents from the Air Force's Office of Special Investigations,
Castaneda said. She invited fellow workers Leocadio Barajas and
Patricia Meyer.
   Barajas later was fired after confronting Gonsalves, and he and
Meyer eventually joined in a lawsuit against Northrop, alleging the
firm had defrauded the government by improperly testing the missile
parts. The Justice Department later joined the suit.
   Castaneda went on temporary disability from Northrop in April
1985 because of stress and a back injury.
   Castaneda told the Times a psychologist was assigned to her
through Northrop's insurance adjuster, but his message was ``to
forgive Northrop and to forgive Mr. Gonsalves _ to ask God to
forgive them _ and to just go back to work,'' she said.
   Castaneda left Northrop for good in April 1987.

   The Port of Portland announced Friday that
the damaged supertanker Exxon Valdez would arrive within six weeks
for inspection if state environmental officials allow it.
   The ship could arrive from May 15 to June 1, said port spokesman
Dick Montgomery, but the state Department of Environmental Quality
has the authority to reject the supertanker.
   The agency will decide after an inspection by a naval architect
who left for Alaska Friday afternoon, said spokeswoman Carolyn
Young.
   The tanker certainly would be rejected if it trailed ``any
significant oil'' while under tow, she said.
   Exxon Shipping Co. President Frank Iarossi has insisted the
vessel won't trail oil.
   Gregg Kantor, a spokesman for Oregon Gov. Neil Goldschmidt, said
the governor was unlikely to comment until after state officials
make their final decision on whether to let the ship dock in
Portland.
   Port officials have been lured to the repair job by the $20
million price tag and the prospect of hundreds of jobs.
   The Valdez is undergoing temporary repairs off the Alaskan
coast. The supertanker struck a reef in Prince William Sound on
March 24, spilling 10.1 million gallons of oil and fouling hundreds
of miles of beaches.

<TEXT>
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini is
taking three Yugoslavs to court for criticizing his order that
author Salman Rushdie be killed without trial as a blasphemer, the
daily Borba reported Friday.
   Police in London, meanwhile, warned bookstores and publishers
Friday night to be on guard against possible new arson attacks by
Moslem militants over Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Borba said the lawsuit was filed with the Belgrade district
attorney's office against Stanislav Marinkovic, editor of Borba;
Vesna Roganovic, a journalist for the paper, and Slobodan Selenic,
a popular Yugoslav author.
   Selenic, head of the Yugoslav Writers' Union, was sued because
of a statement to Borba last month about ``Khomeini's frightening
threat'' against Rushdie, Borba said. Marinkovic and Roganovic were
cited for allowing the novel to be published, the newspaper said.
   The charges are based on Article 158 of the Yugoslav criminal
code, which forbids ``public humiliation'' of foreign countries or
their leaders. Violation of the code carries a jail sentence of up
to three years, Borba said.
   A Yugoslav secretary who answered the telephone at the Iranian
Embassy said no one was available for comment. Friday is the Moslem
Sabbath and the holy month of Ramadan began a week ago.
   When or whether Khomeini will have his own day in a Yugoslav
court was not clear. Borba said several Yugoslav lawyers were
representing Khomeini.
   Among parts of ``The Satanic Verses'' offensive to Moslems a
bordello scene in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's
wives, and the suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran
instead of receiving it from Allah.
   Two London bookstores in central London were set afire last
Sunday in an apparent campaign of intimidation aimed at stopping
sales of the book.
   Sales have rocketed as a result of worldwide publicity over the
novel.
   London detectives refused to say whether more threats of
violence have been received, but Scotland Yard said in a statement
Friday night: ``Last Sunday's incidents may be the start of a
campaign against premises which sell, publicize or make available
Salman Rushdie's novel `The Satanic Verses.'''
   Rushdie, a 41-year-old British citizen born in Bombay, India, to
Moslem parents, went into hiding after Khomeini issued his
execution order Feb. 14.
   Moslem critics of the Iranian patriarch's action say Rushdie
should be tried in an Islamic court and given a chance to repent.

   A woman accused of abandoning her
baby under a jetliner's sink after giving birth in the restroom
pleaded innocent Friday to a felony charge of child endangerment.
   Christina LoCasto, 24, of New York City surrendered to San Mateo
County Sheriff's investigators the day after the newborn, named
Alyssa, was discovered under the sink by an airline worker.
   San Mateo County Superior Court Judge Margaret Kemp set a June 5
trial date. LoCasto, who is free on $50,000 bail, faces up to six
years in prison if convicted.
   Alyssa was found July 13, shortly after a United Airlines jet
arrived at San Francisco International Airport en route from
Newark, N.J. and all passengers had left. The child is in the
custody of relatives.

   Letters to Princess Anne from a handsome aide have
raised speculation of a royal divorce _ an occurrence that has
wrought constitutional upheavals and brought heartbreak to Queen
Elizabeth II's family.
   Whether Anne's 15-year marriage to Capt. Mark Phillips is really
on the rocks or is simply one of those long-distance unions not
unusual in the British upper classes remains open to question.
   The queen's only daughter and Phillips, a commoner and former
army captain who runs equestrian centers, lead virtually separate
lives. They were apart for more than half the time last year. They
have two children _ Peter, 11, and Zara, 7.
   News of the mysterious collection of letters to Anne, 38, from
Royal Navy Cmdr. Timothy Laurence, a 34-year-old bachelor and
equerry at Buckingham Palace, gave new life to rumors which began
in 1981 that her marriage is in trouble.
   The four stolen letters were delivered last week to a mass
circulation newspaper, The Sun, which did not publish them. Police
are investigating the theft.
   With panting headlines, the tabloid press said Anne and Laurence
are in love.
   As usual, the principal characters said little or nothing.
   Anne carried on with a punishing schedule of routine royal
engagements. Phillips, 40, went off to Spain to see about setting
up a riding center there, and Laurence dropped out of sight.
   Anne is only seventh in line to the throne _ behind her brothers
Charles, Andrew and Edward, two young nephews and a baby niece _ so
her divorce would hardly bring a constitutional crisis.
   It was not always so.
   Divorce has hung over the throne since the six-times married
Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic Church in 1534 because the
Vatican would not annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon.
   Each succeeding monarch is titular head of the Church of
England, which frowns on divorce.
   Anne's great-uncle, Edward VIII, gave up the throne to marry a
twice-divorced American, Wallis Simpson. In a celebrated broadcast
on Dec. 11, 1936, he told the nation he could not go on as king
without the support ``of the woman I love.''
   As the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, the couple lived in exile,
mainly in Paris. He died in 1972 and she in 1986.
   In the next generation, the queen's only sister, Princess
Margaret, gave up the man she loved because he was divorced. He was
Royal Air Force Group Capt. Peter Townsend.
   The young princess, then aged 25, told the nation that,
``mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is
indissoluble, conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have
resolved to put these considerations before any others.''
   Townsend, a dashing Battle of Britain pilot and former aide to
Margaret's father, George VI, moved to Belgium where he married
again happily.
   Margaret has never seemed to find happiness.
   In 1960 she married Tony Armstrong-Jones, a talented
photographer and designer who was created Earl of Snowdon.
   The Snowdons, who have two children, were divorced in 1978. He
has remarried; she has not.
   Despite changed attitudes in a country where one in three
marriages ends in divorce, some royal commentators speculate that
Anne will choose to stay married to Phillips while leading a
separate life.
   Richard Kay, royal correspondent for London's Daily Mail, argued
that another royal divorce would ``erode further the concept that
the royal family are somehow different from the rest of us.''
   In the 1970s, Princess Margaret had a widely publicized
relationship with a London socialite 17 years her junior, Roddy
Llewellyn. Newspapers regularly photographed them heading off on
Caribbean vacations.
   But, generally, discretion is the key for the modern royals.
   In contrast, Queen Victoria's heir, Edward VII, was noted most
for his famous mistresses: actress Lillie Langtry; social siren
Daisy Brooke who became Countess of Warwick; and Scottish baronet's
daughter Alice Keppel.
   He came to the throne in 1901 and continued seeing Mrs. Keppel
until he died in 1910.

<HEAD>Tougher Federal Fuel Economy Rules Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a move that would reverse the policies of the
Reagan White House, the Bush Administration is expected to announce
stricter fuel efficiency rules for 1990 automobiles, The New York
Times reported.
   The Times reported in its editions Saturday that Transportation
Secretary Samuel K. Skinner has decided that automakers should be
required to attain an average fuel consumption of 27.5 miles per
gallon in all cars they manufacture. The current standard is 26.5
miles per gallon.
   The Times said that should President Bush endorse Skinner's
proposal as expected, the endorsement could send a message that the
new administration is a strong advocate of preserving the
environment.
   The Reagan Administration had proposed repealing the fuel
economy requirements, which were first imposed in 1974 when the
nation was in an oil crisis.
   Although the nation's automakers will not welcome the ruling, it
is not expected to have immediate drastic repercussions in Detroit,
the newspaper reported.
   It is too late to change the design of the 1990 models, but the
automobile industry probably will meet the new requirements by
selling more of the smaller fuel-efficient cars, the Times said.
   Since the standards apply to the average mileage of all vehicles
made by one company, automakers likely will provide rebates and
incentives to lure buyers to smaller, high-efficiency cars.
   Companies can fall short of the fuel goal in one year without
any penalties if they exceed the standard the next year.
   The Times reported that the stricter 1990 standard does not mean
that the Bush Administration intends to impose even higher
standards in later years.
   But the newspaper said that a higher standard will help the Bush
Administration portray itself as being sensitive to the
environment, especially in face of the oil spill disaster in
Valdez, Alaska.
   Unidentified officials told the Times that secretary Skinner was
especially mindful of energy production in making his decision.
Automobiles burn about 30 percent of all the oil used in the United
States and fuel-efficient cars have long been seen as a tool of
conservation, the newspaper said.
   Foreign cars imported into the United States also must meet the
standards.
   Most foreign cars have no trouble meeting the standard, but some
manufacturers of cars, like the Jaguar, Mercedes Benz and Porches,
have not always met the standard and have to pay penalties to the
government.

<HEAD>Exhibiting Criminal Suspects A Common Mexican Practice</HEAD>

   Americans watching television may have been
surprised to see police exhibiting suspects in a cult of satanic
killings, but displaying prisoners is a common practice in Latin
America.
   ``Basically it's to show the news media they weren't beaten up,
they are healthy and in the same condition they were when they were
arrested,'' said Maurilio Mendoza, chief prosecuting supervisor for
drug cases at the federal attorney general's office.
   ``Of course, they always look a little sad because of the crime
they are accused of and the consequences that await them,'' he
added.
   The presumption of innocence frequently is ignored as
publications carry pictures of suspected drug dealers, car thieves,
bank robbers and murderers being shown to reporters. Confiscated
bags of drugs or other stolen items often are arrayed on a table in
front of the prisoners.
   Suspects in the killings of 13 people in a Matamoros drug cult
were paraded before television cameras last week and answered
questions from journalists. Reporters and cameramen were allowed at
a site Friday as one suspect pointed out a grave and was forced to
dig up the victim.
   Former petroleum union leader Joaquin Galicia Hernandez, who was
arrested on corruption charges in January, always uses the public
displays to declare that his arrest was all because of politics.
   But when drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo was shown to
journalists this week, he refused to say a word.
   Criminal defense attorney Fernando Villanueva said the
exhibition of suspects probably reflects a desire by authorities to
comply with requirements ``on press freedom and freedom of
expression. Police do not have to present or not present a person
to the media.''
   Another trial lawyer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the purpose was to pile up ``psychological evidence'' against the
accused.
   Under Mexican law, a person is presumed innocent until proven
guilty, but Eduardo Loyo and other attorneys say in practice it is
often the reverse.
   Lawyers say other legal requirements often violated are that a
suspect be presented to a judge within 24 hours after the arrest,
that the judge indict or free a person within 72 hours and that a
case be tried within one year if no complications arise.
   ``The procedures and the law are mainly based on the Napoleonic
code in civil cases, but in penal cases it is a combination of
French and Spanish law with Mexican peculiarities,'' Loyo said.
   Suspects remanded for trial are held in detention centers called
``reclusorios,'' which at the federal level generally are clean and
well-run.
   With the warden's permission, prisoners are allowed to bring in
their own food, receive conjugal visits and decorate their cells.
   Although it is known that some prisoners have been able to gain
early release by bribes, convicts in highly publicized cases are
unlikely to get the chance.
   In one recent case two state judges were charged with accepting
a $200,000 bribe to order the early release of a man convicted of

   Mexico has not applied the death penalty since 1932.

   A British man faces up 15 years in
prison on charges he insulted two members of Thailand's royal
family, an official in the British Embassy said today.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the man
was arrested earlier this month at the seaside resort of Hua Hin,
94 miles southwest of Bangkok, and has been released on bail.
   The Thai newspaper The Nation on Friday identified the suspect
as Mark Davis, and quoted police sources as saying he was arrested
March 4 for allegedly making insulting remarks about two Thai
princesses during a restaurant conversation with a Swedish friend.
   Two Thais overheard the conversation and demanded police arrest
Davis, the newspaper said.
   The embassy official said the Briton, a longtime resident of
Thailand, was accused of making insulting remarks about Princess
Maha Sirindhorn, a daughter of King Bhumpibol Adulyadej, and
Princess Saomsawali, wife of Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn.
   The embassy official said only that the man was in his 30s, but
he refused to identify him or give other details.
   The monarch is widely revered in Thailand. The charge of lese
majesty, or insulting the monarchy, carries a maximum penalty of 15
years imprisonment. Foreigners have rarely been charged with the
offense.

<HEAD>Budget Accord Still Has Gaps, Such as Capital Gains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic congressional leaders say they'll
subscribe to President Bush's no-new-taxes pledge in order to pass
a $1.2 trillion budget for the next fiscal year, but beyond that
all bets are off.
   ``When we get into the negotiations (for 1991), everything is
going to be on the table, and frankly I don't see how you get from
point A to point B without having revenues,'' Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn., said Friday, when a
budget agreement for 1990 was announced.
   ``Next time, we're going to have to start looking for some
revenues,'' Sasser said.
   Congressional leaders joined Bush in unveiling the bipartisan
budget agreement, which would reduce the federal deficit to $99.4
billion _ just under the $100 billion limit set by the Gramm-Rudman
budget-balancing law _ without new taxes.
   But the accord, thrashed out in more than a month of high-level
negotiations, puts off most hard decisions on spending details
until later. The budget agreement itself lacks the force of law,
but it does provide a framework for actual spending bills to be
passed later.
   ``Very hard choices lie ahead,'' Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, said Friday at a Rose Garden ceremony.
   What the agreement aims to do is prevent the kinds of partisan
disputes that push negotiations to the wire when the new fiscal
year changes in the fall.
   Missing from the agreement is any suggestion of where the funds
would come from to pay for Bush's proposals for increased spending
for educational programs, the homeless or more environmental
protection.
   Also left unresolved was Bush's proposal for a reduction in the
capital-gains tax from the current 28 percent to 15 percent, his
1988 campaign pledge.
   Democrats say they are firmly opposed, with Sasser calling the
chances of passage ``slim and none.''
   Under the budget accord, Bush agreed to back a smaller defense
budget for 1990 than in the budget he submitted on Feb. 9 _ $299.2
billion for all defense-related programs, including nuclear-weapons
programs in the Energy Department, compared with the original
$300.6 billion request.
   It also calls for discretionary domestic spending of $181.3
billion, up from the $175.9 billion proposed by Bush. It raises
spending in so-called entitlement social programs, where benefits
to individuals are mandated by law, of $556.4 billion, up from
Bush's proposal for $531.4 billion.
   Overall, the plan calls for total deficit reductions of about
$28 billion for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1. The
projected 1990 deficit of $99.4 billion compares with a 1989
deficit estimated by the administration as $163.3 billion.
   At the Rose Garden ceremony, Bush called the pact ``the first
such agreement reached ahead of schedule and not framed in the
context of a crisis'' and said it was a ``first manageable step.''
   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
boycotted the Rose Garden session entirely.
   ``He declined to go out into the Rose Garden and have his
picture taken because he doesn't like the agreement,'' said Bentsen
spokesman Jack Devore.
   Bush long has contended that a final bipartisan accord on the
budget would be cheered by financial markets and help to nudge down
interest rates.
   Asked if Friday's agreement would satisfy the markets, Budget
Director Richard Darman said: ``No. This agreement will be helpful,
but this will not be sufficient for the long term.

<HEAD>North Jury Takes Long Weekend Before Final Arguments, Deliberations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors neared the deliberations stage in the
trial of former White House aide Oliver North, after a final week
of testimony in which prosecutors tried to show North had a
personal financial stake in aiding the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The charges against North should be in the hands of the U.S.
District Court jury toward the end of next week. The last of 48
witnesses gave their testimony on Friday in a trial that has lasted
11 weeks.
   After prosecutor John Keker and defense attorney Brendan
Sullivan rested their cases, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
announced that ``all the evidence is in, ladies and gentlemen,''
told the jury ``you're great'' and sent them home after saying that
they will be isolated during deliberations.
   The jurors will return Tuesday for final arguments expected to
take most of two days.
   In the past week, the prosecution tried to undermine North's
credibility and depict him as venal by emphasizing his relationship
with Iran-Contra co-defendant Richard Secord, who will be tried
separately.
   Keker brought a used car salesman into the courtroom Friday who
had sold North an $8,000 station wagon in 1985. North had said four
days earlier he had paid for the 1982 Chevrolet Suburban out of
$15,000 kept in a metal box in his closet at home.
   The salesman, William Howell, said North told him he would pay
the final $3,000 on the vehicle out of the White House credit
union. Howell also disputed North's contention that he had come to
the car lot intending to buy a $5,000 station wagon and then moved
up to the $8,000 vehicle. North testified he only had $5,000 with
him and had to return to the metal box at home to get the remainder
four days later.
   Keker pointedly asked North whether he had gotten $3,000 from
Secord, whose office is a mile or two from the car dealership, the
same day North paid off the car purchase. North said he couldn't
remember, but insisted he got the money for the car from his metal
box.
   North enlisted Secord in 1984 to secretly run arms to the
Nicaraguan Contras and as a result, $48 million flowed through the
enterprise he set up with business partner Albert Hakim.
   The prosecution also brought in Willard Zucker, a Swiss-based
lawyer who moved money for Hakim and Secord for the Contra
operation and the Iran arms initiative.
   Zucker testified that he met with North's wife, Betsy, in March
1986 to discuss the North children's education.
   North explained that Hakim had wanted to provide for his family
if something happened to him on his dangerous, clandestine mission
to Tehran in 1986 and had told him only that Mrs. North was to meet
Hakim's lawyer.
   Hakim has testified $200,000 was set aside for Mrs. North and
her family in the event of North's death.
   Mary Dix, a former NSC supervisor, said North was extremely
pinched for money and complained about not having enough to buy
lunch and gasoline. His complaints suddenly stopped in mid-1985,
she said.
   North is accused of accepting a $13,800 home security system
from Secord and converting to his own use $4,300 from a huge cash
fund in his office safe financed by Contra leader Adolfo Calero and
Secord.

<HEAD>Energy Chief Says Alaskan Spill Not To Blame For Gas Price Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline price increases that followed last
month's Alaskan oil spill were prompted by customer worries rather
than real threats to the nation's fuel supply, Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins says.
   Watkins predicted Friday that prices are likely to return soon
to ``normal seasonal levels.''
   Retail gasoline prices in recent days have jumped to their
highest levels in three years. Watkins took the unusual step of
issuing the public statement in an effort to ease the customer
concerns.
   ``The interruption of Alaskan crude created serious concern for
future supply curtailments in product markets,'' he said. ``This
concern, more than actual supply curtailments, triggered price
increases.''
   Analysts mostly attribute the price increases to higher crude
oil prices and widespread anticipation that gasoline supplies will
be squeezed by an increase in summer auto travel.
   Watkins said an additional key factor has been the imposition of
state and federal rules that reduce gasoline vapor emissions but
increase refining costs.
   On Monday, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is to open hearings
on whether the oil companies' increases in gasoline prices are
justified by economic conditions. He suggested the companies were
using the Alaska spill as an excuse to raise prices.
   Watkins said that the loss of crude oil as a result of the March
24 tanker spill was 13 million barrels, or about 17 hours of
national consumption.
   ``Supplies are not threatened,'' Watkins said. ``Shortages have
not occurred.''
   Shipments of Alaskan North Slope crude from the port of Valdez
were temporarily curtailed after the spill, but the flow this week
returned to normal.
   Gasoline price increases have been largest on the West Coast,
which is the main destination of Alaskan crude. Nationally, the
average price of a gallon of gasoline rose 10 percent, to $1.10, in
the last month, according to the Lundberg Survey, a Los Angeles
publication that checks prices at 12,000 gasoline stations
nationwide.
   Watkins earlier rejected a call by Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., to
prepare for possible use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Sharp
said in a letter to Watkins last week that announcing preparation
to tap into the underground emergency oil stocks would ``take the
edge off'' market speculation that was driving up gasoline prices.

   Here are highlights of the budget agreement
for fiscal 1990 announced Friday by President Bush and
congressional leaders:
   _Totals: $1.2 trillion in spending, $1.1 trillion in revenues,
$99.4 billion deficit. The budget Bush proposed in February had
similar spending and revenue totals and estimated a $91.1 billion
deficit.
   _New tax revenue: $5.8 billion. Of the total, $5.3 billion will
be from taxes Congress and Bush will have to agree to, and $500
million will be from increased enforcement by the Internal Revenue
Service. Bush proposed $5.3 billion in this category.
   _Other revenues: $2.7 billion by increasing fees for federal
services, such as national park entrance fees, $5.7 billion by
selling as yet unspecified federal assets. Bush proposed a total of
$4.7 billion.
   _Military: $299.2 billion, down from Bush's $300.6 billion
request.
   _Entitlement programs: $556.4 billion in spending for programs
in which benefits are paid automatically to people who qualify,
$6.8 billion less than expected growth. Reductions include $2.7
billion from Medicare, $1.9 billion in farm payments and $1.1
billion from Postal Service and federal pension changes. Bush asked
for $537.3 billion.
   _Other domestic programs: $181.3 billion, $4.5 billion above
Bush's proposal and $300 million less than expected growth.
   _International affairs: $17 billion, down from Bush's $17.4
billion request.
   _Interest payments on the national debt: $181 billion, the same
as in Bush's budget.
   All figures are from the text of the agreement as calculated by
the Congressional Budget Office, or from Bush's proposed budget.

<HEAD>Feds Seize Solvent Thrift, Say Its Practices Unsafe, Unsound</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A large California savings and loan that
allegedly had undue clout with politicians and regulators became
the second thrift to be taken over recently by the government
despite being technically solvent.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said Friday that the 29-branch
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association in Irvine had dissipated its
$5.4 billion in assets, had let its capital dwindle to $20 million
and was operating in an unsafe and unsound manner.
   Another large savings and loan, Gibraltar Savings of Beverly
Hills, Calif., was seized March 31. Regulators stressed that
Lincoln's branches would remain open as usual and that all deposits
were guaranteed up to the $100,000 insurance limit.
   Lincoln has been up for sale while its parent, American
Continental Corp., a luxury resort developer based in Phoenix,
Ariz., prepared to file for federal bankruptcy protection, which
was done Thursday.
   American Continental has contributed heavily to Senate campaigns
and had allegedly received favorable treatment from regulators.
   The bank board said Lincoln's financial troubles started in
February 1984, when it was bought by American Continental and its
management invested in risky real estate ventures, stocks and junk
bonds.
   ``Management appeared to operate Lincoln mainly for the benefit
of American Continental Corp. ... (and) has repeatedly violated
regulations ... and has refused to follow supervisory directives,''
a bank board statement said.
   Lincoln and its owner, American Continental Chairman Charles H.
Keating, have been the subject of considerable controversy over the
last two years.
   An examination completed in May 1987 by regulators at the
Federal Home Loan Bank in San Francisco turned up substantial
irregularities and recommended the seizure of the institution.
   Keating then alleged bias by the regional officials, who
technically work for a board controlled by S&amp;L executives in
competition with Lincoln, and complained to the nation's top thrift
regulator, M. Danny Wall, the chairman of the federal bank board.
   Wall, in an action that angered members of Congress and top
regulators at other banking agencies, prohibited regional officials
from acting against Lincoln. In November 1987 he granted a new
review, which was conducted by examiners based in Washington. That
exam, concluded a year later, upheld the findings of the San
Francisco agency.
   At one point, five senators who received campaign contributions
ranging from $34,000 to $112,000 from American Continental officers
and employees met with regional regulators at the request of
Lincoln.
   Attending the April 1987 meeting in San Francisco were Sens.
Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio, and John McCain, R-Ariz.
Riegle, who would become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee
less than a year later, subsequently returned his $76,100
contribution.
   The House Banking Committee chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, on
Friday renewed his call for Wall's resignation, blaming Wall for
the ``gross mishandling'' of the case and months of delay that will
ultimately cost taxpayers millions of dollars.
   Wall, in a telephone interview, said that until Lincoln's parent
company sought bankruptcy protection, the bank board faced legal
obstacles in taking over the institution while it was still solvent.
   He defended the decision to conduct an independent review of the
San Francisco officials' findings, saying enough questions had been
raised about their actions to warrant a second look.

<TEXT>
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco says the
only way to battle drug trafficking successfully is if all the
countries of the Americas join together in the fight.
   ``Drug production, consumption and traffic is not a problem of
one nation, not even of a group of nations,'' Barco told the
American Societ of Newspaper Editors on Friday. ``It is a universal
scourge. ... We cannot expect successful results if Colombia, or
for that matter any country, is left to act alone.''
   Barco said the scourge could not be ended until the United
States _ which consumes more than half the world's supply of
cocaine _ reduces its demand for the drug, and he called for a
summit of the presidents of the Americas to focus on the problem.
   ``The insatiable demand for drugs in this country is also the
greatest single threat to democracy in our hemisphere,'' Barco said.
   ``The only law narcotics traffic does not break is the economic
law of supply and demand,'' he said. ``If cocaine sales are
tolerated on your streets, coca will continue to be grown in the
hidden valleys and hillsides of South America. We can only break
this trail through concerted action at both ends.''
   Among the summit topics, he said, would be the sharing of police
intelligence and satellite information; better interdiction both of
drugs and of chemicals needed to make those drugs; better transport
and equipment for law enforcement agencies; and more support for
programs to develop alternative sources of income in coca producing
areas.
   President Bush suggested such a summit during the presidential
campaign last year, but there have been no plans set. Bush, who is
not meeting with Barco during his trip to Washington, has invited
him to visit again in July for an official working visit, the White
House announced Thursday.
   Barco stressed that his country has suffered extensively, with
drug-traffickers having directed executions of Guillermo Cano, the
outspoken editor of El Espectador, as well as the deaths of another
30 newsmen, a minister of justice, an attorney general, judges and
more than 1,300 policemen.
   ``Contrary to what so many American TV drama programs suggest,
Colombia is not a nation of criminals,'' he said. ``Rather, we too
are victims of the scourge of narcotics.''
   National drug control policy director William J. Bennett, who
addressed the editors just before Barco, also focused on the need
to reduce the demand for drugs.
   ``If we did education right, the drug problem would only be on
the periphery, on the fringe of society,'' he said.
   Bennett called for construction of new prisons for incarceration
of both drug traffickers as well as so-called casual users.
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh met Friday with the
attorney general of Mexico, Enrique Alvarez del Castillo, during
which he congratulated Alvarez for the recent efforts by Mexico's
new government to crack down on major drug traffickers.
   Thornburgh said in a statement that he and Alvarez agreed to
establish closer ties in the war on drugs.
   Those ties include working on joint operations, increased
assistance to the Mexican government in the training of police and
drug enforcement agents and the establishment of bilateral working
groups ``to study proposals for increasing cross-border
cooperation, upgrading efforts to seize the assets of major drug
traffickers and updating the extradition treaty between our two
countries.''

   Boston University says it has the ``commencement
of the year'' _ President Bush and French President Francois
Mitterrand are scheduled to address the graduating class on May 21.
   Bush and Mitterrand will receive honorary degrees at the
school's 150th commencement, university officials said Thursday.
Barbara Bush also will attend the ceremony.
   University President John Silber, a conservative Democrat,
invited Bush and Mitterrand. School spokesman Tom Cashman said
Silber and Bush have been friends since the 1960s, when Bush was a
congressman from Texas and Silber was a professor of philosophy at
the University of Texas. Cashman said Silber also has been friendly
with Mitterrand for a number of years.
   ``It's certainly the commencement of the year,'' Cashman said.
``We're very pleased because it comes at such a pivotal time for
the university.''
   After Mitterrand told Bush he had accepted Silber's invitation,
Bush invited Mitterrand to spend that weekend at his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   From Maine, the two leaders plan to travel together for the
commencement, the university said.
   Bush also is scheduled to deliver graduation speeches at Texas A

University on May 13 and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy on May 24.

<HEAD>Judge Says Spelling Bee Judgment Is A-F-F-I-R-M-E-D</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENTURA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court has upheld a ruling
against a man who claimed his son was cheated out of a 1987
spelling bee championship.
   ``As for the judgment of the trial court,'' appellate Judge
Arthur Gilbert ruled Wednesday, ``we'll spell it out:
A-F-F-I-R-M-E-D.''
   Leonard McDonald of Thousand Oaks claimed his son Gavin, then
13, lost the Ventura County Spelling Bee because two students,
instead of one, from Los Altos School in Camarillo were allowed by
the sponsoring Ventura Star-Free Press to advance in the contest.
   In the Camarillo contest, student Victor Wang had spelled
H-O-R-S-Y and Steven Chen had spelled it H-O-R-S-E-Y.
   Although judges ruled that Steven won, Star-Free Press officials
said an unacceptable dictionary had been used. A tie was declared
because Webster's Third New International Dictionary said both
spellings were correct. Both Victor and Steven were allowed to go
on to the countywide competition where Steven beat Gavin in the
27th round.
   Gavin's father argued that Steven shouldn't have been allowed to
compete in the county finals and asked for $2 million in damages.
In his lawsuit McDonald named the newspaper, the paper's editor at
the time and Scripps Howard newspaper group, which runs the
national spelling bee in Washington.
   McDonald contended his son suffered unfair treatment that caused
him to lose his standing in the community and suffer ``humiliation,
indignity, grief, fright and mental anguish.''
   Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth Yegan dismissed the
case in November 1987. But the case was appealed.
   Gilbert, in upholding Yegan's action, called the lawsuit
frivolous and said the reason Gavin lost was that he finally
misspelled a word.
   ``Gavin took first place in his school and can be justifiably
proud of his performance,'' Gilbert wrote. ``It is this lawsuit
that is trivial, not his achievement. Our courts try to give
redress for real harms; they cannot offer palliatives for imagined
injuries.''
   John Bowman, editor of the Star-Free Press, said he was pleased
the matter was resolved.

<HEAD>April 28 Picked As Launch Date For Space Shuttle Planet Mission</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   NASA has selected April 28 as date
for launching Atlantis on the first space shuttle planetary mission
with the Magellan-Venus probe.
   The decision was announced Friday following a comprehensive
two-day review of all aspects of the flight by more than 200
shuttle managers and engineers. Liftoff of the shuttle Atlantis was
set for 2:24 p.m. EDT.
   ``While we have much work to do, and little contingency time, we
have established an April 28 launch date,'' NASA shuttle Director
Richard Truly said.
   That had been the unofficial launch target for several weeks.
   During their four-day flight, Atlantis' five astronauts are to
release the $378 million Magellan spacecraft from the cargo bay,
starting it on a 466-day journey to Venus.
   The spacecraft is to orbit the cloud-covered planet in August
1990 and map its surface over the next 243 days with a
high-resolution radar system.
   Magellan is the first new American planetary spacecraft since
Pioneer 13 was launched in 1978, also to Venus. It also is the
first planetary payload to be carried by a space shuttle.
   ``The goal of Magellan is to obtain radar images of at least 70
percent of the planet,'' said Stephen Saunders, Magellan project
scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
   The radar is intended to produce images showing features as
small as 150 feet across. In comparison, Pioneer 13 could not
distinguish features any smaller than 60 miles across.
   Saunders said the images would help scientists understand how
Venus was formed and might provide answers to the puzzling question
of how Earth and Venus, with a surface temperature of 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, evolved so differently even though at the beginning of
the solar system 4.8 billion years ago they were almost identical.
   He said the Magellan pictures might answer questions about the
extent of volcanic activity and settle disputes over whether Venus
once had oceans of water and whether it has shifting crustal plates
similiar to those on Earth.
   Commanding the astronaut crew is veteran shuttle pilot David

<HEAD>Liberal Black Congressman Endorses Lucas to Head Justice Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of William Lucas to head the
Justice Department's civil rights division were given a boost when
a liberal Michigan congressman endorsed the Republican, a fellow
black from Detroit.
   Rep. John Conyers, joining the debate over Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's choice of Lucas, on Friday urged President Bush to
expedite the nomination.
   Conyers' endorsement may blunt the potential effect of the 68-2
vote the Detroit NAACP took last Monday to oppose Lucas, whose
nomination has not been formally announced by Bush.
   Coupled with a decision Wednesday night by the Detroit Urban
League to endorse Lucas, Conyers' support could head off additional
opposition.
   Other civil rights groups, while privately expressing
reservations about Lucas, have withheld public comment, perhaps to
assess the political climate on Capitol Hill.
   Conyers, a Democrat, took issue with statements by civil rights
leaders that Lucas lacks the necessary experience for the job.
   ``Experience is not the issue in the Lucas appointment,''
Conyers said in a statement. ``The most important issue is the
nominee's commitment to civil rights enforcement and affirmative
action.''
   ``After eight years of William Bradford Reynolds at the helm of
the civil rights division, Bill Lucas will be a breath of fresh
air,'' Conyers said.
   ``I believe he is qualified to do the job,'' Conyers said. ``I
am confident of his commitment to moving the federal government
back into being an advocate for civil rights.''
   Civil rights groups have questioned Lucas' qualifications for
the job, noting his lack of experience in the civil rights movement.
   Lucas, a former sheriff and later chief executive of Waymally
submitted by Bush, is subject to Senate confirmation.
   Lucas ran as the GOP's unsuccessful candidate for Michigan
governor in 1968. His choice as civil rights chief is seen by
political observers as part of the Republican Party's efforts to
attract more black voters.
   Critics who have questioned Lucas' commitment to civil rights
noted his statements on affirmative action.
   His record as sheriff has also been cited by opponents, who
point out he was cited for contempt of court in 1976 for failing to
reduce overcrowding in the Wayne County Jail when he was sheriff.

<HEAD>Doctors, Nurses Urged To Watch For Abuse Of Pregnant Women</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tearful woman told how she was brutalized
during pregnancy as the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation
urged doctors and nurses to watch for signs that expectant mothers
have been beaten.
   ``One out of 12 pregnant women is a victim of battering,'' said
Betsy Berkhemer-Credaire, head of the group's Southern California
chapter. ``She is not the only victim. Her unborn child is
incredibly at risk because of this battering.''
   Nurses, a prosecutor and the operator of a battered women's
shelter joined Berkhemer-Credaire on Friday at a March of Dimes
news conference intended to increase awareness of abuse of pregnant
women.
   Also attending was 28-year-old Mary Siering, who choked back
tears as she recounted how her boyfriend abused her while she was
pregnant.
   ``He slapped me in the face, he threw a sneaker at my stomach
when I was five months pregnant, and he put me in a headlock,'' she
sobbed. ``He held me hostage in the apartment against my will. When
I tried to call 911, he ripped the cord out of the wall.''
   Siering, a social worker for Los Angeles County, said her
boyfriend fled to the East Coast without being prosecuted, and her
child, Rita Frances, now 2, ``trusts the world because her mother
cares enough to protect her.''
   Still, battered women are four times more likely to deliver
babies with low birth weights, and twice as likely to miscarry
compared with other mothers, Berkhemer-Credaire said.
   ``Low-birth-weight babies are more likely to be born with birth
defects and more than 40 times more likely to die during the first
month of life,'' she added.
   She and others urged doctors and nurses to watch for signs of
battering in their pregnant patients, and to help document injuries
so the assailants can be prosecuted.
   Battered women also should seek help and emergency shelter and
leave those abusing them, said participants in the conference at
Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles Medical Center.
   Abuse against expectant mothers happens in all racial and
socioeconomic groups, said Anne Stewart Helton, a community health
nurse consultant at Texas Women's University.
   Helton conducted a foundation-financed study of 290 pregnant
women randomly selected from public and private prenatal clinics in
Houston. She found 8 percent _ or one in 12 _ were beaten by their
male partners during pregnancy, and another 15 percent reported
being battered earlier.
   More research is needed to confirm her belief that the
statistics are valid nationwide, Helton said. But many experts
believe the one-in-12 figure is low because women tend to fear
admitting they have been abused, she said.
   ``Only one in every five incidents of domestic violence is
reported,'' said Mia Baker, a special assistant district attorney
who runs Los Angeles County's victim-witness assistance program.
   She said 4,000 American women die at their partners' hands each
year.
   The March of Dimes said 3 million to 4 million American women
are battered each year, resulting in one-fifth of all hospital
emergency room visits by women. Their injuries account for annual
costs of $100 million for medical care and up to $5 million in
absenteeism.

<HEAD>FDA: No Special Chilean Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government is halting special inspections
of fruit from Chile after coming up with no evidence of poisoning
since traces of cyanide were found in two grapes a month ago.
   But fruit from the South American country will still be subject
to routine, random spot checks at U.S. ports of entry, the Food and
Drug Administration said Friday in its announcement.
   The FDA said it expects the Chilean government to continue
inspecting 1 percent of its fruit shipments bound for the United
States for the rest of its growing season, which is winding down.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young said the cooperation of Chilean
officials as well as ``greater consumer awareness, as well as
laboratory studies, and the finding of no additional problems in
Chilean fruit'' combined to end the need for the enhanced
inspections.
   When the tainted grapes were found March 12 after a
cyanide-poisoning threat telephoned to the U.S. embassy in the
Chilean capital of Santiago, the FDA urged that all fruit from
Chile be removed from store shelves and imposed a temporary
detention on Chilean fruit shipments at the docks.
   Five days later, the agency began a stepped-up inspection plan
for fruit being held in warehouses and at the docks, but about 3.5
million cases of fruit, worth about $41 million, that was held by
wholesalers and retailers had to be dumped.
   Chilean fruit exporters and U.S. importers said they lost about
$240 million because of the health scare, but David Holzworth, a
Washington attorney who represents the Chilean Exporters
Association, said the FDA has been ``moving as rapidly as possible
... to get things back to normal.''
   Chilean grapes _ virtually the only fresh grapes available in
U.S. stores at this time of year _ began reappearing on produce
counters about two weeks after the poisoned grapes were found among
samples at the port at Philadelphia. Grapes constitute about 70
percent of Chile's fruit exports.
   After grapes and berries, other Chilean fruits _ including
pears, nectarines, apples, plums and peaches _ were cleared in the
inspection program for sale to wholesalers and retailers and soon
began appearing on store shelves.
   Since the FDA began its enhanced surveillance plan March 17, it
has gradually reduced the proportion of shipments that had to be
visually inspected. The plan began with inspections required for 5
percent of each shipment and was reduced to 4 percent on March 27
and to 1 percent on April 6.
   The inspections were carried out under the FDA's supervision by
several hundred inspectors, who were paid by Chilean fruit
importers.
   Under the plan, more than 9 million crates of Chilean fruit has
been inspected and cleared for sale, the FDA said.

<HEAD>USDA Cites Lack of Support in Canceling Quarantine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department says widespread
opposition in the honeybee industry prompted it to cancel a planned
quarantine of states where a parasitic mite is plaguing apiaries.
   The proposal would have applied to 19 states, the District of
Columbia and 15 U.S. territories or other possessions known or
believed to be infested with the Varroa mite. Public comments were
solicited through March 31.
   ``The comments we have received indicate widespread opposition
to the proposed Varroa mite program,'' James W. Glosser,
administrator of the department's Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service, said Friday.
   ``Without extensive support from the affected groups, a federal
effort to retard the spread of Varroa cannot work,'' he said.
   Under the proposed quarantine, the interstate movement of
honeybees and bee equipment would have been restricted. Such
articles would have required inspection and, or, treatment before
being allowed to move across state lines.
   Varroa mites were discovered in the United States in a Wisconsin
apiary in September 1987. The USDA imposed a quarantine in April
1988 but was canceled after a month because it was too complex to
administer.
   The mite is an external parasite of adult honeybees and their
developing larvae, or brood. Infestations cause decreased brood
numbers, deformed bees and weaken the bees' ability to pollinate
plants and produce honey.

   Actress and special UNICEF ambassador
Audrey Hepburn cut short a tour to review an international relief
operation in the Sudan after rebels refused to promise her safe
passage.
   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army did not guarantee the
safety of her flights to government-held Aweil and then to nearby
rebel-held Akon, said Bryan Wannop, head of Sudan's United National
Development Program and coordinator of the relief operation.
   ``I am disappointed, but I think it is by far the best
decision,'' Miss Hepburn said Friday.
   Earlier, the 59-year-old actress visited a camp for people
displaced by the 6-year-old war. Some 17,000 people lived there.
The camp has a severe shortage of water; 15 people died on Thursday
alone.
   Miss Hepburn walked through the camp and said she was
``heartbroken'' at the conditions. She said, however, that she was
impressed by the amount of help given to people at the camp.
   The United Nations and western relief officials estimate 250,000
to 500,000 people died last year from the war.

   Oscar-winning actor Dustin Hoffman says he's
jittery over his latest role, a part in a London production of a
Shakespeare play.
   The 51-year-old star, who won Academy Awards for his film roles
in ``Rain Man'' and ``Kramer vs. Kramer,'' will play the part of
Shylock in ``The Merchant of Venice.''
   As he read through his part Friday with members of the cast,
Hoffman admitted: ``I know nothing about Shakespeare. I'm nervous.''
   His last stage part was in 1984. He has never acted Shakespeare
or worked with an English cast.
   ``It's the first time in my life that I have memorized words
written by a genius and I'm working with people who know their
stuff,'' he said.
   The play, which opens June 1, is scheduled for an 18-week run at
London's Phoenix Theater.

   ``Next time, we're going to have to start looking for some
revenues,'' Sasser said.
   Congressional leaders joined Bush in unveiling the bipartisan
budget agreement, which would reduce the federal deficit to $99.4
billion _ just under the $100 billion limit set by the Gramm-Rudman

   The lawsuit, filed by a Michigan man who figures to save $800 a

retirees.
   The state hit hardest is Virginia, where 200,000 federal
civilian and military retirees could be owed $150 million in
refunds this year.
   At least 20 others states could be affected, according to an
Associated Press survey that indicates the states could lose $461
million a year in future revenue because of the ruling and could
owe $1.4 billion if refunds for prior years are required.

   The 1906 earthquake has shattered San
Francisco nearly 7,000 times, floods have destroyed a warring
planet and ostrich-plumed showgirls have paraded down the grand
staircase on the world's largest stage.
   But after 11 years of pleasing the crowds at Ballys, ``Hello
Hollywood, Hello'' is saying goodbye to make way for Dino, Liza and
Frank.
   ``It's a wonderful, wonderful show, but it's run 11 years and in
the last couple of years the audience has been down. Our surveys
showed that people wanted to see name stars,'' said Richard Sturm,
vi entertainment at Bally's hotel-casinos.
   Dean Martin will inaugurate the new policy April 27, after the
show's last performance April 18. Martin will be followed by Paul
Anka, Barbara Mce president forandrell, Liza Minnelli, Barry Manilow and
Frank
Sinatra.
   ``It will be a real sadness,'' said Diane Petersen, a principal
singer who has been with the show since it opened June 2, 1978.
   ``That's always a difficult part of our business. You become so
close to people, then face the reality that you've got to go other
directions.''
   Michael Eardley, a principal singer who also has been with the
show from its opening, echoed the spirit of family in the 90-membere.
   The waterfalls weigh six tons each. Another set weighs 10 tons.
   The stage, built solely to accommodate ``Hello Hollywood,'' is
58 feet shorter than a football field and 180 feet wide. Three
giant elevators descend into a basement below for scene changes.
   Sturm said Bally's was not ruling out the possibility of future
productions in Reno, and that there has been talk of selling
``Hello Hollywood'' _ earthquakes, waterfalls and all _ if a buyer
comes along.
   Greg Glodowski, a principal dancer who moved here nine years ago
from the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, said the area will lose a
valuable pool of talent when the show closes. He will stay in Reno
to work as an attorney specializing in tax matters, and will dance
with the local ballet company.
   Eardley and his dancer-wife, Katherine, who met 4{ years ago on
the ``Hello Hollywood'' stage, run a recording studio and music
production company.
   Petersen is considering public relations work so she can remain
in the Reno area if another performing opportunity doesn't come
along.
   ``Hello Hollywood'' was developed around a motion picture theme
when the casino was the MGM Grand, and the scenes remained after
Bally's bought it three years ago.
   Eardley said it is essentially the same show as when it opened,
a sameness that challenges the performers to keep their scenes
fresh.
   ``You may be bored or sick as a dog and not feel like singing a
love song, but this is a business like any other and you call upon
your technique and discipline and that's what gets you through,''
he said.
   ``You know that most of the people out there are seeing it for
the first time,'' Peterson said. ``They're going to see it one
time, so you want to be the best that you can be.''

   The quality of corporate debt improved in the
first quarter. The quality of corporate debt deteriorated in the
first quarter.
   Which you believe depends on which of the two major bond-rating
services you listen to.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. says the quality of corporate credit, as
determined by the company's ratings of debt issues, improved in the
January-March period.
   Moody's Investors Service, the other major debt-rating service,
says that corporate credit quality continued its downward trend,
due mainly to buyouts, restructurings and stock buybacks that
affect corporate debt levels.
   For the quarter, S&amp;P says it upgraded the ratings of 88 debt
issues representing about $63 billion in debt, while it downgraded
64 issues representing about $30 billion. The number it upgraded
was about 1.3 times the number it downgraded.
   Moody's says it upgraded 32 companies representing $33 billion
debt, while it downgraded 66 totaling $47 billion. Moody's
downgrade-to-upgrade ratio was 2.1-to-1.
   One of the reasons for the vastly different snapshots of
first-quarter debt quality is the timing of when the two ratings
services upgrades or downgrades various debt issues.
   ``There may be leads and lags,'' said John Lonski, Moody's
senior economist.
   For example, Moody's upgraded $3.9 billion in USX Corp. debt
last September. S&amp;P didn't make a similar upgrade, involving $5
billion in USX debt, until the first quarter, thus accounting for
some of the difference in the overall quarterly ratings improvement
noted by S&amp;P.
   Similarly, some of the bonds Moody's downgraded during the
quarter may have been downgraded earlier by S&amp;P.
   ``As far as we're concerned, the first quarter had twice as many
downgrades as upgrades,'' Lonski said last week.
   Kenneth C. Pfeil, a senior vice president at S&amp;P, agreed that
the timing of ratings changes was a factor in the differing
interpretations of how debt fared in the first quarter.
   Another reason could be the subjective factor inherent in debt
rating. Rating are not based entirely on hard numbers; in part,
they reflect a judgment call on how a company's expected courses of
action will affect its debt. Because of this variable, the ratings
of the two services can differ.
   But Pfeil added that he believes his firm's first-quarter
ratings picture is a fluke in an otherwise downward trend of
corporate debt quality.
   Since 1982, he said, there have been only three other quarters
where S&amp;P's upgrades exceeded downgrades, he said.
   ``After this quarter, we'll probably see the downgrades overtake
the upgrades again. I don't think we've broken the trend,'' he said.
   A company's debt rating is important because it can affect the
price of the debt securities and the amount of interest a company
must pay on new debt issues in order to entice investors to buy
them.
   For example, when a company's debt rating drops, it may find
that it has to offer a higher interest rate on any new issues,
making them more expensive.
   Lonski said that though Moody's believes the overall quality of
corporate debt deteriorated in the first quarter, it actually
improved slightly from the last quarter of 1988, when Moody's had
57 downgrades to 25 upgrades, for a downgrade-to-upgrade ratio of
2.3.
   About half the Moody's downgrades in the first quarter reflected
the continued concern by the credit rating companies about the
effects of corporate takeovers and restructuring, Lonski said.
   When one company takes over another through a leveraged buyout,
it typically takes on a huge chunk of debt from the loans and
credit-market issues needed to pay for the acquisition.
   Such debt raises concerns about the ability of the company to
pay interest on its existing debt.
   For example, both ratings services downgraded the debt of RJR
Nabisco Inc. in the first quarter due to the $25 billion leveraged
buyout of the Atlanta-based food and tobacco giant.
   The other half of Moody's ratings downgrades during the quarter
reflect various factors, such as increases in corporate debt due to
other restructurings including stock buybacks, Lonski said.
   Lonski also wasn't optimistic about corporate credit quality
improving in the near future. He said he expects the wave of
corporate takeovers and restructurings involving debt to continue.
   ``We see no end to the situation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Stock Market Sees No Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you are willing to take the word of one
veteran forecaster, you can be confident that the economy won't
slip into a recession this year.
   The prophet in question is not some individual gifted with
second sight. Rather, it is the collective vision of countless
investors as expressed by the stock market.
   In recent history, whenever a sustained business slump has
occurred _ in 1969-70, 1973-75, and 1981-82 _ stock prices fell for
several months before clear signs of economic weakness appeared.
   Now, despite all the talk on Wall Street about an economic
slowdown in the face of rising inflation, high interest rates and a
long list of other worries, stocks are holding their ground at or
near their highest levels in a year and a half.
   ``One of the best leading indicators we have of the economy, the
stock market, is not forecasting a recession,'' said Jeffrey
Applegate at Tucker, Anthony &amp; R.L. Day Inc.
   There are plenty of skeptics who question the reliability of the
market as an early-warning system.
   When stocks crashed in the fall of 1987, they note, the dire
events they seemed to be portending never came to pass. That was by
no means the first time that the market predicted a phantom event.
   Nevertheless, analysts say, it would be very unusual for a real
recession to catch stock investors completely by surprise.
   ``The market has held up incredibly well through a bunch of
negatives which, normally, would have thrown stocks into the
tank,'' observed Jay Donnaruma at First Albany Corp. in Albany, N.Y.
   Of course, all this could change on very short notice. Most
analysts readily acknowledge that there is plenty in the present
business and economic picture to worry about.
   Consider the assignment facing the Federal Reserve: Clamp down
on inflation, but keep the economy moving ahead at a sustained
pace, all the while keeping the dollar stable in foreign exchange.
   Nevertheless, stocks managed to post their third consecutive
weekly gain in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30
industrials rose 32.26 to 2,337.06.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index gained 1.96 to
168.89; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
added 6.97 to 417.68, and the American Stock Exchange market value
index was up 5.23 at 335.82.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 149.48 million shares a day,
against 158.94 million the week before.
   In the view of some analysts, the stock market's steady showing
is anything but reassuring. They see it as a symptom of a troubling
complacency manifesting itself in many areas of the financial world.
   ``The junk bond market appears to be agreeing with the `new
wave' economists that recessions are things of the past,'' says
Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc.
   ``Virtually all of the $180 billion of outstanding `junk' has
not weathered even one recession.''
   DeVoe says the low level of long-term interest rates in relation
to short-term rates ``also shows an incredible amount of optimism _
verging on complacency.
   ``This would suggest that long-term investors are less concerned
about inflation than the Fed, or are convinced that inflation
worries have been exaggerated and the Fed will be able to keep
price indexes under control.
   ``Maybe, maybe not. However, we remain a skeptic about any
future government's ability to keep inflation below the 5 percent
level, which would appear to justify a 9 percent long Treasury bond.
   ``We remain extremely cautious about both the stock and bond
markets.''

<HEAD>One Big Deal Collapses, Another Succeeds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pinstriped lawyers and bankers worked
frantically on two big deals within blocks of each other in lower
Manhattan, feeling the deadline heat of an imminent triumph or
defeat.
   By the end of the week, the proposed sale of Eastern Airlines
had collapsed in failure, while a long-delayed settlement of civil
charges was reached between the government and Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   On the surface, the two events had nothing to do with each other
and shared more contrasts than similarities.
   Eastern is a moneylosing business that has come to symbolize
airline deregulation at its worst and labor-management feuding at
its most intractable. Drexel is a rough-and-tumble, moneymaking
Wall Street powerhouse that incited the use of junk bonds to
finance mergers, crossed the bounds of illegality and agreed to pay
for it.
   But underneath the differences lie some common threads: Both the
Eastern and Drexel stories are the outgrowth, directly and
indirectly, of the 1980s debt-financed takeover decade.
   Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo is a longtime Drexel client who used
its renowned prowess in high-yield, high-risk junk-bond market to
help him finance his Texas Air Corp. airline empire.
   Peter V. Ueberroth, the former baseball boss and Olympics
organizer who offered to buy Eastern for $464 million, had planned
to use Drexel's junk-bond financing to complete the deal.
   Ueberroth even had kind words for Michael Milken, the
billionaire Drexel banker who helped create the junk-bond market
and is now fighting criminal charges of securities fraud and
racketeering that stem from a nearly 3-year-old federal crusade
against Wall Street corruption.
   The charges facing Milken are the same that Drexel successfully
dodged this past week via an unprecedented agreement negotiated
with the Securities and Exchange Commission that will effectively
make the firm a government-run business for three years.
   Under terms of that pact, which will enable Drexel to plead
guilty to six felonies and pay a $650 million criminal fine in a
separate deal with the Justice Department, the firm will banish
Milken and appoint as chairman a former SEC chief who presided over
the initial investigation into the firm in late 1986.
   Moreover, Drexel will cooperate with federal probes into other
Wall Street crimes, broadly restructure its business and let the
SEC supervise every aspect of its trading and financial structure.
   The Eastern and Drexel stories share another common element that
has yet to be played out: their shrinking size and influence.
   Whether Eastern is sold or kept by Lorenzo, it is bound to be
much smaller and has been hardly missed in the competitive airline
brawl. Already rival American Airlines has moved aggressively into
markets vacated by Eastern and has expressed interest in buying
some of its assets.
   Drexel, though it remains a leader in the junk-bond market, has
conceded losing hundreds of millions of dollars in business because
of the federal fraud probe and now faces the prospect of competing
as an admitted felon, without the enormous clout wielded by Milken.
   _Exxon Corp. faced more criticism and a toughened government
attitude over its handling of the nation's largest oil spill from a
grounded company tanker in the Prince William Sound of Alaska.
Federal officials took over the supervision of the disaster and
ordered the oil giant to produce a detailed cleanup plan.
   _Government statistics on the economy injected more confusion
into the financial markets and the direction of interest rates _
the cost of money. The trade deficit widened in February from a
flood of imports, implying more inflation and higher interest
rates. Wholesale prices in March rose moderately, suggesting
inflation is easing. Business inventories rose in February and
sales fell, suggesting production cutbacks and an economic decline.
   _Real and attempted takeovers swept the banking, drug, computer
and chicken businesses. Banking company NCNB Corp. pressed its
effort to buy Citizens &amp; Southern Corp.; pharmaceutical giants
SmithKline Beckman Corp. and Beecham Group PLC of Britain agreed to
merge, creating what would be the biggest drug company behind Merck
& Co.; Hewlett-Packard Inc. agreed to buy Apollo Computer Inc.; and
Holly Farms Corp. shareholders voted on a proposed merger with
ConAgra Inc.

   As the Channel One commercial news program for
teens completes a test run this week, geography teacher Jim Peters
expects a planned series of reports on life in Japan will command
his class' attention.
   His seventh graders at Eisenhower Middle School in Kansas City,
Kan., were captivated in early March with a Channel One series on
Russian teen-agers and paid more than usual interest to his lesson
that week about the Soviet Union.
   ``Instead of some 40-year-old geography teacher telling them
what he saw when he went there, the show allowed the kids to see
something fresh for themselves every day,'' he said.
   Peters expressed hope that the reports on Japan will give an
educational boost to this week's lessons on that nation.
   Those are hopes shared by the Channel One developers, Whittle
Communications LP, which has visions of turning the test project
into its biggest commercial venture yet by taking it national in
the fall of 1990.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based media company has spent more than
$5.5 million on its Channel One test that began running in six
schools March 6. The costs including equipping each school with
about $50,000 in televisions and video equipment to receive the
daily 12-minutes news shows.
   But Whittle and school officials know that the project will not
win much support nationally if they can't show it helps educate
youngsters.
   That is one of the reasons that in each of the five weeks of the
test, Whittle sent teachers a course guide with suggested exercises
based on that week's program.
   Even as the 25th and last show signs off this Friday, Whittle's
task of evaluating whether the project should be expanded has only
begun.
   Ed Winter, the Whittle executive who has overseen the
development of Channel One, said that decision won't be made until
mid-summer.
   Before that, he plans intensive talks with administrators,
teachers, parents and students at each of the six schools in the
test. In addition to Kansas City, the schools are in Cerritos,
Calif.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Cincinnati; Billerica, Mass.; and Detroit.
   He will also be evaluating research designed to determine if the
program significantly improved students' knowledge of current
events.
   Tests will have been given to students at each of the test
schools as well as their sister schools which did not see the show.
   Researchers have also interviewed students on behalf of the
seven advertisers who bought part of the two minutes a day of
commercials carried on the show.
   The commercial involvement that has seen companies pitch jeans,
chewing gum, deodorant and candy to an audience of 10,000 teens has
drawn fierce attacks from children's advocates and educators
including the National Parent-Teachers Association.
   Patricia Albjerg Graham, dean of the Harvard School of Education
in Cambridge, Mass., said school officials should not be fooled
about Whittle's basic intentions. ``Whittle is doing this to make
money,'' she said.
   She said there is a potential danger in programs such as Channel
One for teachers to feel they can trim their lesson plans because a
topic may have already been covered on the news show.
   ``The danger is that you'll give them this icing on the cake and
never get on with the nutritious carbohydrates and the meat,'' she
said.
   She said while the test has probably done no harm to the
students and may have boosted their awareness of current events,
she said a longterm commitment to such programs could have
unfortunate consequences.
   Since students are required by law to attend school and schools
are hitting them with commercially-sponsored TV programs, she said
some students may conclude it is just as important to eat a certain
kind of fast food as it is to learn arithmetic.
   ``That is a subliminal message that is very bad for our
children,'' she said.

   The good news is the trade deficit eventually
will shrink. The bad news is why.
   The next recession, which may come next year, will cause a
short, sharp and temporary improvement in the trade gap by
decreasing American demand for imported goods, economists say.
   Increased foreign ownership of American factories also will
shrink the deficit. That's because foreign companies will supply
the American market from factories here instead of by shipments
from abroad.
   A decline in the value of the dollar will make the deficit
smaller. But a cheaper dollar means Americans' money is worth less
in world markets and foreigners can buy U.S. assets at bargain
prices.
   Managed trade is touted in Washington as a way to close the
trade gap. But ``managing'' trade usually involves restricting or
taxing imports, which hurts people who buy things like
videocassette recorders.
   In summary, the four main factors that should eventually narrow
the trade deficit _ recession, foreign ownership, a cheaper dollar
and trade policy _ all carry big negatives.
   ``There is no free lunch. There's no solution that's going to
make everybody happy,'' Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy
Institute in Washington, said last week.
   The trade deficit has a good side: It means Americans are
consuming goods and services from abroad without being required to
pay for them with an equal amount of goods and services created in
the United States.
   But the foreigners are accumulating IOUs, and persistent trade
deficits have turned the United States into the world's largest
debtor.
   The stubbornness of the deficit was obvious last Friday when the
Commerce Department reported that March's deficit had jumped 20.9
percent to $10.5 billion.
   A fresh decline in the dollar undoubtedly would help shrink the
deficit somewhat, but U.S. policymakers are too aware of the ``good
news, bad news'' tradeoffs to favor sharp depreciation.
   The American economy, already running near full capacity, could
go into inflationary overheating if a dollar drop did stimulate
exports dramatically. Higher-priced imports would also add to
inflation.
   Moreover, a cheaper dollar would make it even easier for
Japanese, German, British and Canadian companies to buy American
assets, ranging from Treasury bonds to hotels and factories.
   ``I have some Japanese clients who are very eager to have the
yen go higher because they want to transplant to the United States
and they want to do it cheaper,'' said Harald Malmgren, an economic
consultant in Washington.
   Malmgren said he was convinced that American imports of cars
from Japan will virtually cease within three years because of North
American production by the Japanese automakers. The U.S. plants
will even export cars to Europe, Latin America and Japan.
   The good news on trade is bad news for Detroit. The Big Three
automakers will have a hard time competing with the modern U.S.
factories of Honda, Nissan, Toyota and the rest.
   One neglected cause of the trade deficit is the durable demand
for dollars by foreign central banks, which use the U.S. currency
the way they once used gold, as a reserve to back their own
currencies.
   The dollars that Americans spend on foreign goods are finding
their way into the vaults of foreign central banks instead of
coming back to the United States through purchases of American
goods.
   A trade deficit is thus the unavoidable consequence of the
appetite for dollars by foreign central banks, said John Mueller,
chief economist of Bell Mueller Cannon Inc.
   The good side of that bad news is that the IOUs held by the
foreign banks may never be cashed in, Mueller said. ``In effect
they are permanent holders of dollars. They will be permanent
loans.''

<TEXT>
   Billionaire hotelier Jay Pritzker resurfaced
Friday with a proposal to buy strike-crippled Eastern Airlines,
sources said, reviving the chance of a sale following the collapse
of a deal with ex-baseball boss Peter Ueberroth's investor group.
   Ueberroth himself was said to be still interested in reviving
his own bid for the airline, and takeover speculator Carl Icahn
plans to discuss a possible deal with union representatives this
weekend, the sources said.
   ``Right now is a good time for the pot to boil,'' said one of
the sources, who were close to the situation but spoke on condition
they not be identified.
   They said the Pritzker proposal essentially mirrored a bid he
made before the Ueberroth deal was announced April 6. The value of
the Pritzker offer wasn't clear but based on his earlier offer
would be worth about $500 million.
   Pritzker's representatives presented what they described as an
exploratory proposal Friday to a meeting of the 15-member Eastern
creditors committee in Manhattan, the sources said.
   It called for Pritzker to buy Eastern's fleet of around 250
planes for an unspecified cash payment and lease them back to
Eastern, the sources said.
   In addition, Pritkzer would pay Eastern around $100 million
cash, receive all Eastern's stock except for an unspecified share
to be owned by its unions, and forgive $185 million owed to Eastern
by its parent Texas Air Corp., the sources said.
   Pritzker did not return telephone calls to his Chicago office
and Texas Air aides declined to comment on the latest chapter of a
tortuous effort to peddle the nation's seventh largest airline,
which has been mired in a bitter strike and bankruptcy-court mess
for more than a month.
   Texas Air officials said after the Ueberroth deal failed that
they intended to restructure Eastern as a smaller airline with
about half its prestrike workforce and flight schedule.
   But potential suitors may have been prodded to keep their feet
in the door by a federal judge's order on Wednesday, issued shortly
after Ueberroth formally withdrew his offer.
   The former baseball commissioner's deal fell through because of
an intractable dispute between the unions and Texas Air boss Frank
Lorenzo over whether a court-appointed trustee should run
Miami-based Eastern until Ueberroth's group could assume control.
   With his order, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland moved to
lure other buyers _ raising the possibility of an auction
supervised by his court.
   Lifland, overseeing Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization, ordered
the parties in the case to explain on Monday why he shouldn't
invite other bids for Eastern that would include major assets it
owned before Lorenzo bought the airline in 1986.
   Charles E. Bryan, the leader of Eastern's Machinists, said
Friday he remained confident that the airline will fly under a new
owner, and he noted that Ueberroth shouldn't be ruled out as a
candidate.
   ``It will be resolved. That's my prediction,'' Bryan said in an
interview. ``There are several other credible buyers.''
   In addition to Ueberroth, Bryan would identify only Icahn. Bryan
said he was late for a speech Friday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
because he was returning a phone call from Ueberroth.
   Bryan declined to discuss the conversation, but said he
considers the former Olympics organizer still ``a player.''
   Ueberroth said Thursday that he had not been in touch with any
of the parties involved, including Lorenzo, Texas Air and
bankruptcy court officials. He would not try to get in touch with
them and did not expect to hear from them, Ueberroth told a
reporter after a speech in New York.
