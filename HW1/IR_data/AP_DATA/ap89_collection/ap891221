<HEAD>Stun Gun Inventor Sentenced to 14 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The inventor of an ultrasonic gun used to stun
racehorses was sentenced Thursday to 14 years in jail for his
involvement in a multimillion dollar cocaine ring.
   Southwark Crown Court Judge Gerald Butler also ordered assets of
auto dealer James Laming worth $38,320 be confiscated or Laming,
49, would face an additional 18 months in jail.
   A jury convicted Laming and two other men Nov. 14.
   Ring leader Rene Black, 35, was sentenced to 15 years for
masterminding the $24.8 million cocaine operation, which included
Europe's first cocaine factory.
   The judge ordered Black's $2.4 million in assets confiscated
with the threat of 10 more years in prison if he defaulted.
   Butler ordered Black deported to his native Peru after serving
his sentence in solitary confinement for his own protection.
   Police said Black was flown by helicopter to court hearings
because of fears former associates were trying to kill him.
   A third defendant, Patrick Fraser, 38, was sentenced to eight
years in jail for possessing 17 ounces of cocaine with intent to
supply.
   Black's father-in-law, Ronald Fisher, 52, was sentenced to 30
months after pleading guilty to helping Black launder
drug-trafficking money.
   Laming's defense was that he knew Black only as a backer of his
stun gun plan to undermine betting and bookmaking and was ignorant
of the cocaine ring.
   Testimony said Laming's stun gun disguised as binoculars could
fire a beam of sound over 50 feet, audible only to horses. The
effect on a racehorse would have been like a ``firework exploding
in its ear,'' the court was told.
   The prosecution called the stun gun a smoke screen to explain
away the drugs link.

<TEXT>
   Some say 1989 has been Bangkok's Year
of the Condominium. Others call it the Year of Greed.
   The air of this once languid city of tree-shaded canals and
quiet temples now is filled with the thud of pile drivers and the
thunder of traffic.
   There seems to be no reprieve. Bangkok has become a vast work
site of mushrooming high-rises, its streets choked with traffic and
pollution at dangerously high levels.
   The boom began about three years ago. With annual growth rates
around 9 percent to 10 percent, Thailand is talked about as Asia's
next economic miracle and Bangkok as the dynamic hub of peninsular
Southeast Asia.
   Land prices in the city have soared to as high as $1,115 a
square foot in prime areas. Millions are being made in land
speculation and construction. Rents, not long ago among the most
reasonable in the world, are approaching the levels of New York,
Hong Kong and London.
   In the upper class residential area along Sukhumvit Road, more
than 50 towering condominiums, apartment blocks and office
buildings are rising on what were once leafy family compounds and
peaceful lanes.
   What worries planners and many citizens is that Bangkok is not
only destroying its past, but possibly also its future, with
unplanned growth.
   Forecasts are largely ominous.
   The United Nations predicts Bangkok's population will nearly
double to 12 million by 2000, making it the 10th largest city in
the world.
   The Thailand Development and Research Institute says the city's
mighty Menam Chao Phraya, ``the River of Kings,'' will be devoid of
all aquatic life by the end of the century unless decisive action
is taken immediately. Every day, the institute says, tons of
untreated waste pour into the river from sewers and the
now-befouled canals that earned Bangkok the name ``Venice of the
East.''
   Already serious, pollution is expected to worsen as more
factories sprout around the capital. The main culprit now in air
pollution is the omnipresent motor vehicle and its leaded fuel.
   The National Environment Board recently found lead levels along
Bangkok streets to be up to four times higher than standards in the
United States, and hospitals are reporting children with abnormally
high lead levels in their systems.
   The topic of inordinate greed by the few has become the talk of
the town. A ``me-first'' attitude is often held responsible for
many of Bangkok's woes.
   ``I believe if they could dig up Thailand and put it in a
parcel, they would sell the country, too,'' Bangkok Post columnist
Normita Tongtham wrote recently of what he described as
unscrupulous businessmen.
   Academics, journalists and some technocrats criticize what they
say is blatant pollution by commerical enterprises, disregard for
public well-being by real estate developers, and the quick resort
to bribery to circumvent regulations and laws.
   The critics claim vast economic power _ and behind-the-scenes
decision-making _ is still in the hands of a few Chinese-Thai
families and say it is their ethos that now pervades Bangkok rather
than the traditional Thai one of being satisfied with a modest
lifestyle.
   Standing in stark contrast is Chamlong Srimuang, widely expected
to win re-election in January as Bangkok's mayor.
   A 55-year-old Buddhist, he seems to represent older, rural
values that still attract a large, albeit still largely powerless,
segment of Bangkok's population.
   ``We must not be selfish,'' is one of Chamlong's tenets; another
is, ``Eat less and spend less.''
   He means what he says.
   Chamlong sleeps on a floor mat, eats one meal a day and dresses
in the rough-spun cotton shirts of upcountry farmers. He drives a
battered old car and has donated his salary to the city.

   The 12-year-old girl who corresponded
with Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega is standing by her deposed pen
pal.
   Sarah York said Wednesday she was upset with the U.S. invasion
of Panama and was worried about the safety of Noriega, who went
into hiding.
   ``I hope that he's doing OK and nothing bad will happen to
him,'' she said. ``He's very nice and intelligent and seems like
the kind of person someone can trust. He never let me down and I
feel like I can trust him. ...
   ``I'm really disappointed about what our two governments are
doing and I feel for the safety of Panamanian and United States
soldiers.''
   Sarah struck up a correspondence with Noriega following his 1988
indictment on U.S. drug charges. She has visited the dictator
twice, first as his guest last year, then in October on her own.
Noreiga called her a ``meritorious daughter'' of Panama.
   Her parents, criticized for allowing the visits, condemned the
invasion.
   ``We are a family among the American people who support the
Panamanians in their struggle for self-determination and
sovereignty,'' Pauline York said in a recorded telephone message at
her home.
   ``We join the people and the nations of the world in calling on
the president and his military to end this invasion. To the
Panamanian people: Todo por la patria,'' which means ``all for the
motherland,'' the recording said.

<TEXT>
   The military strike in Panama to seize Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega is the latest in a long history of U.S. military
interventions in the Western Hemisphere. Here is a chronology:.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   1823 _ President James Monroe enunciates ``Monroe Doctrine,''
stating U.S would regard as unfriendly acts any interference with
Western Hemisphere nations by European powers.
   1855-60 _ American adventurer William Walker installs himself as
Nicaraguan dictator, is ousted, captured by British, turned over to
Honduras and executed.
   1898 _ After Spanish-American War, U.S. troops occupy Cuba.
Troops are later withdrawn but are sent back three times, in 1906,
1912 and 1916, to put down rebellions.
   1903 _ President Theodore Roosevelt dispatches warships and
troops to isthmus of Panama to assist Panamanians trying to secede
from Colombia after Colombia rejects treaty with U.S. to build
canal across isthmus. Rebel victory ensures building of Panama
Canal and U.S. occupation of Canal Zone.
   1904 _ Roosevelt adds ``Roosevelt Corollary'' to Monroe
Doctrine, saying U.S. might be compelled ``in flagrant cases of ..
. wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international
police power.''
   1909-10 _ Rebels backed by U.S. oust regime of Nicaraguan
President Jose Santos Zelaya. U.S. banks lend money to Nicaragua
under conditions that give them control of nation's finances.
   1912 _ Marines sent to Nicaragua at request of President Adolfo
Diaz and U.S. banks to restore order and put down forces opposed to
U.S. control. Marines remain in Nicaragua until 1925.
   1912-26 _ U.S. forces land in Honduras on three separate
occasions to protect American interests, particularly U.S business
interests such as banana-growing United Fruit Co.
   1915 _ Marines land in Haiti when bloody disorders erupt during
summer, threatening American banking interests. Anti-U.S.
insurrection erupts and lasts two years, taking 1,500 Haitian
lives. Marines left in 1934.
   1916 _ President Woodrow Wilson sends Marines to Dominican
Republic after that nation's president, who opposed U.S.
intervention to prevent a threatened revolution, resigns. U.S.
military government takes over and lasts eight years.
   1927-33 _ Marines return to Nicaragua to put down revolution led
by Cesar Augusto Sandino. Forces pull out in 1933 as criticism of
intervention grows in U.S. Sandino assassinated in 1934 on order of
Anastasio Somoza Garcia, head of U.S.-backed national guard.
   1934 _ President Franklin D. Roosevelt institutes ``Good
Neighbor'' policy of non-intervention in Central American internal
affairs.
   1954 _ Leftist government of Guatemalan President Jacobo Arbenz
Guzman initiates land reform in Guatemala, expropriating two-thirds
of United Fruit's 332,000 acres. Eisenhower administration, through
CIA, supports rebels who overthrow Arbenz and establish military
dictatorship.
   1961 _ Invasion force of anti-Castro Cuban exiles trained by CIA
lands at Bay of Pigs in Cuba and is quickly crushed.
   1965 _ President Johnson sends 20,000 troops to Dominican
Republic after civil war breaks out. American forces, whose mission
was ostensibly to protect American lives, fought against rebels.
Some 2,000 Dominicans and 20 American soldiers were killed before
peace was restored and elections held. U.S. troops withdrew in 1966.
   1980 _ U.S. sends military advisers to El Salvador to counter
Cuban aid to leftist rebels as that nation slides towards civil war.

remaining advisers left in 1985.
   NOVEMBER 1982 _ First reports emerge alleging covert U.S. aid to
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels in Nicaragua.
   APRIL 8, 1984 _ Congressional sources say CIA has been
supervising mining of Nicaraguan ports, to undermine Sandinista
government.

as show of force against Nicaragua, whose forces crossed Honduran
border chasing Contra rebels.
   DEC. 20, 1989 _ U.S. troops attack military bases in Panama to

<UNK>Hungry Zoo Invaders Mistake Rare Bird for Turkey</UNK>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Ermelindo Martins saw what
looked like a giant turkey loose in Rio's zoo, visions of a
Christmas feast overcame his good sense.
   In a pre-dawn raid Tuesday, Martins and a friend attracted the
long-necked bird to the fence and broke its neck. As they prepared
to load the 65-pound carcass into a supermarket cart, they were
caught by the night watchman and taken to a police station.
   There they learned that their victim was a rhea, a rare,
ostrich-like bird from Brazil's central plains. Killing one is
considered an ``ecological crime'' and punishable by up to six
years in prison.
   ``It doesn't look anything like a turkey. And its meat is hard,
almost inedible,'' said zoo spokeswoman Esther Nazareth.
   She explained that the zoo had five _ now four _ rheas that were
allowed to roam the grounds at night. They had not been molested
until now, she said.
   Martins, 22, and his 16-year-old companion, whom police did not
identify because he is a minor, said at the 17th precinct station
that they lived in the Tuiuti Hill shantytown and had simply been
looking for dinner.
   ``We're not criminals, we were just hungry. We thought we were
seeing a turkey _ big, but a turkey,'' Martins told the Rio
newspaper O Globo.

   A tenant behind in his payments pushed his vocal
chords to the limit by shouting, ``Hey landlord, wait three days
more for my rent!'' to win the annual Halls Year-End Loud Voice
Contest.
   Hiroyuki Saito, 28, hit 120.0 decibels on the sound meter on
Wednesday to win the ninth annual shouting contest along with $360.
   Toru Komoriyama, a 24-year-old television reporter, took second
place by hollering, ``I want to be rich!'' Komoriyama warbled the
meter at 117.9 decibels and won $215.
   Company employee Shigemi Okada, 27, shrieked ``Don't use chicken
in the beef barbecue!'' at 115.9 decibels to take third place and
$140 in the raucous contest, held outside a Tokyo train station.
   In the special ``unique shout'' category also carrying a $140
prize, student Kosuke Ushijima, 22, bellowed ``Gorby, you're doing
a good job! Best wishes with perestroika!'' won for the men in
110.7 decibels.
   Lovesick Hisayo Nishikawa, 25, yelled ``Hideaki, please wait for
me in New York! I'll go next year!'' in an ear-piercing 112.6
decibels to take the women's prize. Hideaki, a man's name, was not
identified.
   A telephone ringing registers about 50 decibels, while traffic
noise is about 100. One risks one's hearing at 150 decibels.

   Commuters brush past the outstretched paper cup
as its holder serenades them in the subway with the hymn, ``There
Is No Secret What God Can Do.''
   Walter McKinney sings for his supper, which is soup and a bagel
when he can get it. ``I might have to sing 35 to 40 minutes to get
a dime,'' he said.
   It's the season of giving, and shoppers sashay to department
stores in mink coats and fur-lined boots.
   Over a pair of pajamas, McKinney wears four pairs of pants, two
shirts, two sweaters, two jackets and two coats. The sleeve on his
gray outercoat, a Pierre Cardin donated by a Wall Street
benefactor, was torn from cuff to shoulder in a tussle with a
policeman.
   His fur scarf came from a woman's coat found in the trash. His
feet are shod with Reebok sneakers salvaged from a shoe store's
garbage. The shoestrings are missing, seized after his last arrest.
That's standard police procedure so prisoners won't hang themselves.
   His raspy wailings strain to be heard above the screeching train
brakes and cranking turnstiles at a midtown subway stop.
   ``It's hard to get money from people today,'' McKinney lamented.
``They're fed up. They're distrustful. In a lot of cases, they're
hostile. They don't want to be bothered. ...
   ``There ain't no generosity.''
   A good day, McKinney says, brings $20 _ a nickle, or dime or
quarter at a time _ for five hours of gospel melodies and ramblings
on abortion, the death penalty and El Salvador. A bad day means an
empty cup and an empty belly.
   He's not alone in the streets. Homeless Vietnam vets, beggars in
wheelchairs and mooching musicians playing violins all have their
hands out.
   The competition makes for tough times even at this time of year,
when New York gift-wraps an entire Fifth Avenue building, hangs a
2-ton snowflake as a street ornament and adorns a 65-foot tree with
miles of lights.
   It seems like Christmas. And yet McKinney says police ran him
off when he was panhandling shoppers outside Bloomingdale's. He
says he's been kicked by security guards and tossed down escalators
by street gangs. He says he has been spat upon and pelted with
bottles.
   McKinney, twice divorced, says he has no other way to survive. A
native of Sanford, Fla., he hasn't had a job in 20 years and
prefers the streets to shelters, which attract gangs and psychos.
   ``There's no stigma to begging. It's better than stealing,'' he
said.
   If a day's collections are paltry, McKinney sifts for scraps in
the garbage. He interrupted an interview to retrieve a discarded
meatloaf sandwich.
   ``You got to take advantage of every opportunity,'' he explained.
   The hard life yields a hard look.
   McKinney's dreadlocks, which he says haven't been shorn in four
years, bulge from a painter's cap. A fresh scar runs from under his
right eye to his nose. His upper gum is toothless except for the
left canine.
   A canvas backpack pinned shut stores his Bible, a spare pair of
socks, his hat and gloves.
   ``Everything I have I found. I ain't bought nothing but food for
20 years,'' McKinney said.
   Well, not exactly. He's partial to quarts of Ballantine's beer.
His presmoked cigarettes are reclaimed from the floor.
   There's a momentary glimmer of Christmas at the Third Avenue and
53rd Street subway stop, where he offers his daily hymns. Someone
requests ``Silent Night.'' It's worth a quarter.
   With the day's take, he buys a beer and heads to Harlem to eat.
   At night, McKinney trudges the streets. Prostitutes are the only
other creatures walking.
   If he gets too cold, a subway corridor provides shelter. Or he
may just sleep on the train. His way of beating the chill: ``You
just keep moving.''
   Mornings find him at a bench in Battery Park, where hedges are a
windbreak. There he can rehearse or read his discarded newspapers.
   ``That bench is my home. It's the one place I can go and feel
safe and secure,'' McKinney said. ``I like to amble about, not be
hassled and bothered by the devils and demons.''
   Then he's off to Wall Street, where his ragtag clothes from a
giveaway bin clash with the gray flannel of brokers. He washes his
feet in restroom sinks of office buildings or Trinity Church.
   Eventually, his routine takes him back to the subway platform,
every day, holiday or not.
   Singing, he sticks out the modern day version of the tin cup _ a
crumpled paper coffee container decorated with scenes of Greek
temples and the words ``We Are Happy To Serve You.''
   ``I never asked for anything,'' McKinney said. ``I have the cup
out to receive if they care to give.''

   The various military divisions that took part
in ``Operation Just Cause,'' the U.S. force that invaded Panama,
include:
   _Task Force Atlantic: This consisted of an Army battalion from
the 7th Infantry Division and a battalion from the 82nd Airborne
Division, which was in the Jungle Operations Training Center in
Panama. Atlantic's mission was to secure several critical sites in
the Atlantic-Caribbean side of Panama. Troops also took control of
the prison at Gamboa.
   _Task Force Semper Fidelis: This was made up of a Marine rifle
company and a light armored infantry company; Marines as well as
additional military police. Semper Fidelis secured the Bridge of
the Americas and ensured the security of Howard Air Force Base and
its environs.
   _Task Force Red: This consisted of an Army Ranger battalion that
parachuted into Panama. Their mission was to take over the
international airfield, preparing it for forces from the 82nd
Airborne to land. They were assisted by Special Forces units
assigned to Panama's Southern Command.
   _Task Force Bayonet: This consisted of a battalion from the
Army's 6th Mechanized Division. It was supported by a platoon of
light tanks as well as the 5th battalion of the Army's 87th
Infantry. Bayonet provided security in Panama City's central
section and the mechanized battalion seized the Comandancia, the
headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Forces.

<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are tempering their
initial support of President Bush's decision to attack Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega's stronghold with concern about the ``renegade''
dictator's elusiveness and a possible long stay in Panama for U.S.
troops.
   ``I can see a scenario whereby the support for this operation
could turn difficult for the president,'' Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, told reporters on
Wednesday.
   ``If there is a beginning, middle and end to American military
involvement it is far better than having this thing dragging out
over weeks and months,'' added Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis.
   In the hours after American forces invaded Panama, lawmakers
from both parties endorsed Bush's action as the only option left to
remove suspected drug trafficker Noriega and establish a democratic
government.
   ``President Bush's actions were justified based on the changing
and alarming circumstances of recent weeks in Panama,'' said Sen.
Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior Foreign Relations Committee
member, called the invasion ``an overwhelming success because
democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in Panama.''
   But as the day wore on with reports of Americans held captive
and Noriega still a fugitive, lawmakers hinted that the U.S.
action, dubbed ``Operation Just Cause,'' may prove problematic.
   ``Noriega continues to elude us and we don't know where he is
... plus the hostage situation, that's a very difficult hostage
situation, plus some kind of a continued American presence, loss of
life here and there, occasional sniper fire,'' Aspin said.
   Kasten, ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, stressed the importance of the
United States withdrawing its Army rangers and special forces as
quickly as possible.
   International public opinion in Latin America might well turn
against the United States if there is ``sustained fighting with
U.S. troops in uniform and Panamanian blood being spilled,'' Kasten
said.
   Sen. Charles Robb, D-Va., emerging from a classified briefing
conducted by Defense and State department officials, said, ``It's
fair to say the duration of the operation is of serious concern for
a good number of people.''
   But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking minority member on the
Senate Armed Services Committee, cautioned against imposing a
schedule on troop withdrawal.
   ``I don't think we should try to impress a time line,'' Warner
said after the briefing.
   Aspin predicted that some U.S. forces will remain in Panama for
several months, possibly a year, shoring up the decimated
Panamanian Defense Forces, most of whom served as police, custom
inspectors or in some public safety capacity.
   The U.S. presence was likened to the situation in Grenada when
American MPs remained for several months after the invasion.
   In addition to the concern over the presence of U.S. forces,
lawmakers said interpretation of the Panamanian invasion as a major
achievement was complicated by Noriega, who remains at large.
   ``The fact that General Noriega is unaccounted for means that
the principle issue is unresolved,'' Robb said.
   ``Now it is our responsibility to track down the renegade
General Noriega and bring him to the United States, where he can be
tried and punished as the criminal he truly is,'' added Sen.
Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo.
   Aspin said he believes Bush will be ``under some political heat
if two, three days from now we still have not found Noriega and
captured him.'' The Wisconsin Democrat, however, cautioned against
judging the success of the operation on whether Noriega is captured.
   Other lawmakers questioned the invasion's impact on U.S.
relations with Central American nations.
   ``I am gravely concerned ... that this unilateral military
intervention may do long-term damage to our foreign policy, to our
ability to work with other nations in Latin America, and to our
goal of achieving lasting democracy in the region,'' said Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee.

   When American blood is shed, Americans rally
around the flag. Remember the Maine. Pearl Harbor. Mayaguez,
Grenada and the unsuccessful Iran hostage rescue.
   The doubts come later.
   When the casualties are tolled and the troops have returned,
there may be rethinking. But the immediate reaction of the American
people is to be on the president's side.
   Sure enough, the first of the surveys, a tally of viewers by
Cable News Network on Wednesday afternoon, showed 91 percent
supporting the American action in Panama.
   It's the Roman candle effect, says Stephen Hess, a Brookings
Institution scholar.
   ``It goes pop,'' he says. ``It's an immediate burst into the
air, but like a Roman candle, it also tends to fall quickly. In
short, it's like a shot of adrenalin in the body politic.''
   If the Panama operation had come close to an election, Hess
says, ``that Roman candle burst of color in the air would have been
very valuable.''
   Military actions like the one in Panama tend to wipe other
troublesome issues off the front page.
   ``It's hard to keep two balls bouncing and it's impossible with
three balls,'' says Hess. ``It's the crisis of the moment, like the
children's game where paper covers rock and rock breaks scissors.
This is the newest one in and will immediately take precedent.''
   Bush, for instance, had been under fire for sending a delegation
to China while the memories of Tiananmen Square were still fresh.
The latest development in that story came Monday when the White
House conceded it had made an earlier, high-level visit only a
month after the Chinese massacre of student demonstrators.
   On Wednesday, with gunfire in Panama City and smoke in the San
Miguelito neighborhood, the troublesome subject of China had faded,
at least for a while.
   In 1983, President Reagan faced sharp questions when more than
200 U.S. Marines and sailors were killed by a suicide terrorist
bomb in Beirut. Just two days later, Reagan sent troops to the
Caribbean island of Grenada and elicited an outpouring of patriotic
support.
   A New York Times-CBS News poll taken after the bombing in Beirut
found ``substantially'' more Americans approved of the U.S.
military presence there than a month earlier. It also found that a
slight majority approved of the Grenada invasion.
   Reagan's approval rating improved three points, to 49 percent,
after those two events. But the Times noted that Reagan ``thus far
has not become the beneficiary of the sharp upturn of approval that
presidents often enjoy after a foreign crisis.''
   Jimmy Carter, not the most popular of recent presidents, got a
46 percent approval for his handling of the Iran hostage crisis of
1979-1980 in a Newsweek poll taken after the aborted plan to rescue
the Americans. Seventy-one percent said Carter was right in the
attempt; only 18 percent disagreed.
   When Reagan sent American planes to bomb Libya in 1986, a USA
Today poll found 84 percent of the American people would support
another attack on that country if it were linked to another act of
terrorism. And more than two-thirds of 534 adults surveyed in an
NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll an hour after the attacks
supported the strike.
   Gerald Ford sent American sea, air and ground forces to rescue
39 U.S. crewmen when their container ship Mayaguez was captured by
Cambodians in 1975. The operation cost more lives than it saved,
but the president's approval rating in a Gallup Poll rose by 11
percent _ one of the sharpest gains ever recorded. The previous
high was Richard Nixon's 17-point rise in approval after the
Vietnam peace settlement in January 1973.
   While the national adrenalin is flowing, policymakers can
announce news that otherwise might be controversial. As proof,
Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Wednesday notified
Congress that the U.S. embassy in Moscow will be torn down because
it is riddled with listening devices put there by the Soviets. A
new facility will cost an estimated $500 million.
   At any other time that might have received critical reviews and
widespread attention, especially during a Christmas-time news
drought. With troops in Panama, it's possible that hardly anyone
will notice.

<HEAD>US Military Action in Panama Raises Legal Questions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush launched military action
against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, he cited the
dictator's declaration of war against the United States and attacks
on U.S. servicemen, saying ``that was enough.''
   The decision won Bush strong congressional support. But a few
congressional dissenters and some legal scholars say the legal
underpinnings for the invasion are likely to become the subject of
debate if the stay of U.S. troops in Panama stretches into weeks.
   The most adamant critic was Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman
of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the constitution, who
dismissed administration arguments that the invasion was a matter
of self-defense.
   ``There was no danger to our national security from this weak,
small country, nor was the Panama Canal in real peril,'' Edwards
said in a statement issued while he was traveling in Budapest,
Hungary.
   Michael Glennon, an international law professor at the
University of California-Davis, said the United Nations charter
gives countries the right to use force for self-defense. But the
charter is clear that in order to exercise that right, a country's
interests must come under actual attack.
   Threats and intimidation _ for example, the unconfirmed
intelligence reports cited by Secretary of State James A. Baker III
of an impending Noriega attack on U.S. civilians _ are not
sufficient grounds for action, he said.
   Nor is the simple desire to oust a government inimical to U.S.
hopes for Panama, he added.
   Glennon, who was counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee during consideration of the Panama Canal treaties in
1978, also said any claim that the treaties give the president
additional authority for military action is incorrect.
   ``The treaties make it abundantly clear ... that there is no
authority to use armed force in hostilities that he (the president)
did not have prior to ratification of the treaties,'' he said.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the
administration believed there was ``clearly legal authority under
both U.S. law and international law'' for Wednesday's military
action.
   Baker listed the U.N. charter and that of the Organization of
American States as the legal basis for the action. Echoing Bush, he
said Noriega's declaration of war and the killing of an unarmed
U.S. Marine this weekend ``gave us the right to take the steps
necessary to remove this threat.''
   Constantine Menges, a scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute and formerly a Latin American policymaker in the Reagan
White House, said justification for the military move went well
beyond events of the past few days in Panama, and included dozens _
and perhaps hundreds _ of incidents involving Noriega's forces and
U.S. military personnel over the past few years.
   ``It's a matter of judgment, and we elected (Bush) to make that
judgment,'' said Menges, who was an architect of the 1983 invasion
of Grenada by U.S. forces that ousted a leftist government. ``It's
reasonable, by any common-sense reading'' of the U.N. charter, he
said.
   That judgment was contested by Jules Lobel, a law professor at
the University of Pittsburgh who also is associated with the Center
for Constitutional Rights, a liberal New York-based civil liberties
group.
   ``I'd say it's clearly illegal under the UN Charter and the OAS
charter,'' Lobel said. ``The United States doesn't have the right
to unilaterally decide to overthrow another government by the use
of force. Nothing that the president said today or the secretary of
state said would give the United States such a right.''
   A second issue raised by the invasion is that if the United
States has the right to intervene in Panama, who within the
American government holds the authority to commit forces? The
Constitution makes the president commander-in-chief of the
military, but gives Congress the sole power to declare war.
   ``As a purely technical constitutional matter, the president
does not have the authority to do what he did,'' said David Cole,
another attorney for the center.
   Several legal scholars agreed, and predicted that if U.S. troops
remain in place for long, Congress will seek to invoke its
prerogatives through the War Powers Act, a post-Vietnam law enacted
in 1973 that requires approval from Capitol Hill for deployment of
force longer than 60 days.
   ``The use of force will rapidly move into the domain of shared
powers,'' said Glennon. International law and domestic
understandings allow the use of force ``to defend American citizens
and members of the armed forces in an emergency situation. Once the
emergency is over, it is necessary to come to the Congress and get
approval.''

<HEAD>Invasion Off to a Rocky Start, Faces Daunting Challenges</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the Bush administration was counting on a
quick, surgical strike in Panama, officials can only conclude that
their surprise military action is off to a rocky start.
   While the wisdom of President Bush's decision almost certainly
will be debated at length in Congress, the massive American
military force dispatched to Panama faces daunting challenges, as
does the new U.S.-installed Panamanian government as it seeks
acceptance both at home and abroad.
   Seldom are military operations pulled off without a hitch and
Panama is no exception. The invasion dealt the Panamanian Defense
Forces a severe blow, but Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega remains on
the loose. The deaths of American soldiers tend to undercut a
primary goal of the invasion: protecting American lives in what
Bush's view was an increasingly unsafe environment in Panama.
   The 24,000 U.S. troops in Panama still face the challenge of
securing control over Panama City. They also may be confronted with
the possibility that some Americans may be held hostage and that
armed pro-Noriega partisans may be able to engage in guerrilla
warfare.
   Still, the Pentagon could take some comfort that organized
resistance dissolved within hours after the operation began
Wednesday morning.
   The acceptance both nationally and internationally of the
government the United States helped install in Panama remains
uncertain. The Bush decision will be viewed positively over time if
Panamanians accept President Guillermo Endara as their leader and
foreign governments show their approval by dispatching ambassadors
to Panama City.
   Bush is able to boast perhaps only one unqualified endorsement
from a foreign leader _ Great Britain's _ while the voices from
Latin America have been almost uniformly negative.
   At the Organization of American States, the holdover pro-Noriega
envoy was allowed to assume Panama's seat Wednesday. The envoy sent
by the newly installed government was rebuffed.
   Things have gone better for Bush on the home front, with the
strong bipartisan congressional backing standing in sharp contrast
to the widespread criticism Bush endured following the recent
disclosure of two high-level trips to China.
   A Cable News Network poll found public support for the action in
excess of 90 percent.
   And few could argue with the assessment of William J. Bennett,
the director of national drug control policy, who said of Noriega,
``I think we can safely conclude that this ends his career as a
drug trafficker. He's not running drugs. He's not running Panama.
He's just running. And that's good.''
   The administration hoped that by now Noriega would have been
hustled off to Florida to face charges of narcotics trafficking.
But when U.S. troops arrived where Noriega was thought to be on
Wednesday, he wasn't there. The White House is offering a $1
million bounty for him.
   Fairness requires that Bush's critics take into account the
consequences of doing nothing, permitting Noriega to continue what
many agree has been a corrupt one-man rule in one of the
hemisphere's most strategically placed nations.
   Bush said he had no choice but to do what he did.
   ``I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that
every other avenue was closed and the lives of American citizens
were in grave danger,'' he said.
   The wisdom of Bush's decision will be discussed well into the
winter months and beyond. The risks and rewards of his decision are
such that there may not even be a definitive judgment by the time _
according to the Panama Canal treaties _ Panama is ready to assume
full control of the waterway at midnight on Dec. 31, 1999 _ 10
years and 10 days from now.

<HEAD>Guerrillas Shoot Eight Store Owners After `People's Trial' in Town
Square</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Maoist guerrillas killed eight store owners in
the main square of a small Andean town after giving them a mock
trial on charges of selling food at inflated prices, police said.
   In a separate incident, police said Wednesday that a group of
the Shining Path rebels attacked the town of Sacsamarca, 225 miles
southeast of Lima, and killed eight members of a peasant community
defense group.
   A police patrol encountered the guerrillas as they left the town
on Tuesday and killed two rebels, police said.
   Also Tuesday, 10 guerrillas armed with automatic weapons entered
the town of Changos Alto, 175 miles southeast of Lima, where they
sought out the owners of eight small businesses.
   After staging a ``people's trial'' in the town square, in which
they accused the eight of hoarding food to resell at inflated
prices, the rebels shot them to death, police said.
   The Shining Path launched its armed insurgency against Peru's
elected government in 1980. The government says more than 17,000
people have died in the violence.

<TEXT>
   Dodging gunfire and patrols of both
U.S. troops and Panamanian militia, civilians took to the streets
of a city in chaos and enthusiastically looted everything from
jewelry stores to appliance shops.
   A festive atmosphere reigned Wednesday in commercial districts
as civilians walked away with cameras, tires, mattresses, even
refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at a time.
   As midday temperatures hovered at 99 degrees, Red Cross teams
scurried to pick up bodies from the pre-dawn fighting before they
decomposed in the heat.
   Men, women and children emerged from the low-income area of
Chorillo and Old Panama, where combat was especially intense, and
walked to churches, hospitals and schools in search of safety.
   Some cursed the U.S. troops, others Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Still others said they had faith in the strongman's powers of
survival.
   ``They (the Americans) have been very tough with this invasion,
and the poorer people had to suffer most,'' said Juan, about 25
years old, as he and a group of friends fended off the heat with
cold beers a few yards from the Old Panama barracks, destroyed by
American troops.
   ``If you keep standing in the middle of the street, the
`gringos' are going to arrest you,'' Juan warned a reporter. About
half a dozen American soldiers sat on a roadside patch of grass
about 20 yards away.
   The GIs appeared nervous as they took a break to eat lunch.
   A few blocks away, a housewife of about 40 looked happily at the
American troops. ``There was no other way to get this bandit out,''
she said of Noriega.
   A man of about 25, with unkempt hair, spray-painted a nearby
wall: ``Sovereignty Without Noriega!''
   Armed toughs who support Noriega took advantage of the chaos to
commandeer cars, often at gunpoint.
   Attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a Panamanian Defense
Forces barracks on a hill in the San Miguelito neighborhood to the
northeast, a stronghold of the Dignity Battalions _ the armed
militia loyal to Noriega.
   One man who said he was a government employee stood at a
newsstand near the Foreign Ministry building. About 35, he refused
to give his name but said he had confidence in Noriega.
   ``The MAN,'' he said, referring to the general by his nickname,
``he's going to resist and things are going to get tough for the
Yankees. He knows what he's doing.''
   At dozens of U.S. Army checkpoints, those who wanted to pass had
to get out of their cars and drop to their knees while their
vehicles were thoroughly searched.
   In one house, where four reporters were hiding along with the
residents, the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wife
noticed an 8-by-10 color photo of her husband as a student shaking
hands with Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   She swiftly hid the photo in their bedroom.

   Leonard Bernstein will conduct
Beethoven's ``Ninth Symphony'' in East and West Berlin in two
concerts to celebrate recent historic events in Germany.
   Musicians from the United States, Britain, France, West Germany,
East Germany and the Soviet Union will play under Bernstein's
baton, said Justuz Frantz, director of the Schleswig-Holstein Music
Festival and coordinator of the Berlin performances. He announced
the concerts Wednesday.
   The first concert will be Saturday at the Berlin Philharmonic in
West Berlin, the second on Christmas Day at the East Berlin
Schauspielhaus theater.
   The performance in West Berlin will be broadcast live on a giant
screen near the city's Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church so people can
see it free, he said.
   Bernstein put together the international orchestra to
``symbolize the four Allies,'' as well as the two German states,
Frantz said.

   Tom Cruise, although familiar with ``The Color

   ``I don't know how many times I have to say this, but having
clout in the business has never been a huge concern of mine,''
Cruise said in Rolling Stone magazine's Jan. 11 issue.
   ``And I have never done a film for money. ... That's not what
acting is for me. I love doing it, and I want to try different
things,'' said Cruise, who co-starred with Dustin Hoffman in ``Rain
Man'' and Paul Newman in ``The Color of Money.''
   His most recent different thing: the role of disabled Vietnam
veteran Ron Kovic in the just-released ``Born on the Fourth of
July.'' Cruise said he ignored the advice of studio executives and
others who felt he should steer clear of the role.
   ``People want to limit things,'' Cruise said. ``They say, `God,
you're going to lose everything? Aren't you afraid?' ... Somewhere
I guess you want to find out, how far can I fall? How deep is the
well? When am I going to hit? I want to know that.''

he helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in the alleged plunder of the
Philippine treasury.
   Khashoggi has been free on $10 million bail since he was
extradited to this country from Switzerland in July. Conditions on
his bail include that he remain in New York and that his movements
be monitored by an electronic bracelet.
   Khashoggi, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, has been
living in a Fifth Avenue penthouse. His trial with Mrs. Marcos is
scheduled to begin March 14.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan on Wednesday granted his request
for the three-week vacation to visit family after Khashoggi's
lawyer, Robert Morvillo, said in a letter that prosecutors had
consented to it.

   An ABC News producer taken hostage in Panama
said he was held in a Panamanian army intelligence headquarters,
where he was ``threatened constantly'' but released.
   The producer, Robert Campos, said Wednesday night he was
abducted at the Panama City Marriott Hotel with four other
Americans, and that to his knowledge none of the others had been
released. CBS producer Jon Meyersohn and an American businessman
staying at the Marriott were separated from Campos and a Colombian
national after their abduction, Campos said by telephone on
ABC-TV'S ``Nightline.''
   CBS said it had received no word of Meyersohn's whereabouts.
   ``A group of us were on the mezzanine level of the hotel when we
saw the `dignity battalion' soldiers entering the hotel from the
lower level,'' he said, referring to Gen. Manuel Noriega's
staunchly loyal paramilitary force.
   ``We tried to run away by taking an elevator up to a higher
floor and when the elevator doors opened, two soldiers leveled
their AK-47s at us. We again tried to run but they said that they
would kill us if we did. They laid us on the floor and took us off
in a pickup truck.''
   Campos said they were taken to an army intelligence headquarters
near downtown Panama City, about a mile from the military
headquarters. About 75 people were at the building, all armed,
mostly with AK-47s, he said.
   ``We were threatened constantly,'' Campos said. ``We were told
that many Panamanians were dying because of this invasion and that
we would pay. This Colombian gentleman spoke up and said he had a
wife and a daughter to worry about and one of the soldiers told
him, `If I feel like it, I'll make sure you never see them for
Christmas.'''
   Campos was held nearly six hours before being released, said
Laura Wessner, a spokeswoman for ABC News.

   Most of the 150 captured Panamanians
being held in an automobile storage lot were cooperating as U.S.
military officers tried to determine which of them were civilians
caught up in combat and which were POWs.
   The prisoners made a forlorn-looking group Wednesday as they
stood in the lot under a broiling sun. Some prisoners wore military
fatigues; others wore casual civilian clothes such as T-shirts and
shorts. Most were shirtless.
   Staff Sgt. Phillip Salcido of Las Cruces, N.M., said some were
in fact civilians caught up in combat, and officers were
questioning them to determine who could be released.
   The lot, holding brand-new Japanese and Korean cars, was
surrounded by razor-sharp concertina wire.
   Though Salcido said most prisoners were cooperating, some
squabbled over cooperating with their questioners. An MP broke up
one apparent fight that Salcido said might have been planned as a
diversion for an attack on guards.
   In a remark he took back immediately, Salcido quipped that a
prisoner cooperates or ``accidents happen.''
   One prisoner called out to another, in Spanish, ``Speak Spanish
to them.''
   ``All of them are being given every right under the Geneva
convention,'' said a military police captain.
   Officers said refugees from the fighting were being taken to
Balboa Stadium, the city's largest sports complex. ``The POWs,
though, they will remain with us,'' said one officer.
   Reporters were not permitted to talk with the prisoners, nor
were they flown over the city or permitted to go to one of the
objectives of the attack because of concern over sniper fire.

<HEAD>Executive Says Murphy Unmoved by Buchwald Movie Script</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Paramount Pictures executive said
Eddie Murphy was told in 1983 about an Art Buchwald script idea for
Murphy to play an African king visiting America.
   ``We had just made a new deal with Eddie to make four or five
more movies,'' David Kirkpatrick recalled Wednesday at the trial of
Buchwald's $5 million lawsuit against Paramount. ``The purpose of
the meeting was to tell him what was ahead for him.''
   He said Murphy listened politely to several script ideas
including the one by Buchwald, then titled ``King for a Day.'' ``He
didn't react negatively to `King for a Day,' but he didn't jump up
and down about any of the projects,'' said Kirkpatrick.
   Later, he said, Murphy's manager, Bob Wachs, read five or 10
pages of a script written from Buchwald's treatment, and did not
like the script.
   Buchwald, the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist, claims Paramount
stole his idea for Murphy's hit movie, ``Coming to America.''
   On cross-examination by Paramount lawyer Robert Draper,
Kirkpatrick sought to explain why he and other executives generated
a blizzard of memos in 1983 and 1984 about the anticipated
production of ``King for a Day.''
   He said a new studio chief, Ned Tanen, had arrived recently and
the memos were intended to show Tanen that projects were in the
works for Murphy.
   He said the proposals included plans for Murphy to play a
priest, a prisoner, a detective, a witch doctor and a schizophrenic
with 10 personalities.
   Kirkpatrick, chief of production at Walt Disney Studios,
identified dozens of memos written in 1983 and 1984 that included
the story idea entitled, ``King For A Day,'' among the top projects
in the works for Murphy and director John Landis.
   In one 1984 memo, Kirkpatrick said another executive had circled
the ``King for a Day'' entry and scribbled the word: ``Great.''
   But later that year, Paramount dropped the idea, which involved
an African prince coming to America in search of a bride. Three
years later, Paramount produced ``Coming to America'' starring
Murphy and directed by Landis. The story involved an African prince
who comes to America in search of a bride.
   The film, one of Murphy's biggest hits, grossed more than $300
million.
   Studio officials say there are no similarities between
Buchwald's script idea and ``Coming to America.'' They contend that
Murphy and his co-star, Arsenio Hall, conceived the idea and
created a series of humorous incidents never mentioned by Buchwald.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis
returned to Panama after a seven-month absence Wednesday and
declared that neighboring Latin American leaders would ``deep
down'' be pleased that U.S. troops ousted Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   But he warned that life in Panama would remain dangerous as
Noriega loyalists retaliate.
   Davis left Panama the day after Noriega voided elections which
most observers say he lost to opposition candidates now installed
by the U.S. action. However, other Latin American countries have
sharply criticized the United States and have refused to accept the
new leadership in Panama so far.
   Davis said the position of those leaders was a reflection of
their many years supporting non-interventionist treatment of their
region. But he said privately they had to be pleased.
   ``I think that deep down that they're glad to get rid of this
man,'' he told a heavily guarded press conference at Howard Air
Base. Only a pool of reporters from Washington was allowed to
attend.
   He expressed concern that Noriega supporters would seek revenge.
   ``I think that this is a very difficult time for security
because of retaliation. There will be retaliation,'' Davis said.
   The returning ambassador said he was bringing an economic
recovery plan for discussion with Panama's new leaders, but made no
promise of U.S. aid except to point out that $700 million in assets
would be returned as a result of President Bush's decision to lift
economic sanctions.

   The Rolling Stones got
short-circuited for more than three minutes during their
pay-per-view concert, depriving their TV fans of a little bit of
``Satisfaction.''
   A technical difficulty in the time delay transmission of
Tuesday's pay-per-view audio signal produced a network outage of
three minutes and nine seconds just after 10:59 p.m. EST, said
Brian Lewis, a spokesman for Set Pay Per View, the distributors of
the show.
   ``It affected the last minute and a half of `Satisfaction' and
some crowd scenes,'' Lewis said.
   ``Satisfaction'' is the next-to-last song of the Stones'
concerts on the ``Steel Wheels'' tour, which ended its 32-city run
Wednesday in Atlantic City.
   Lewis said the outage would not affect the replay of the repeat
pay-per-view telecasts scheduled for Saturday.
   Suzan Couch, another spokeswoman for the distributor, said each
of the 815 cable companies receiving the program would have to
decide whether to refund any of their customers' money.
   Pay-per-view prices ranged from $19.95 to $24.95.

   Using yellow, brown, and magenta crayons, Ms. War recently drew

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, whose
office has been at the center of a federal investigation of
corruption, has died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.
   Crowell, 57, died Wednesday at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center. He never regained consciousness after he shot himself in
the head Dec. 12.
   ``He essentially was found to have no brain function,'' said Dr.
Joseph Ross, associate vice chancellor for medical affairs at
Vanderbilt. Tests Wednesday showed little blood flow to Crowell's
brain and doctors decided to remove him from life-support systems,
Ross said.
   The suicide was the second by a state Democratic official during
a statewide federal investigation of public corruption.
   Crowell's office has been a focus of an investigation that has
resulted in 25 people being indicted. Crowell twice testified
before federal grand juries, although he said he had been assured
he would not be indicted.
   Federal authorities investigating illegal bingo gambling and
public corruption reportedly had been closing in on Crowell.
Investigators reportedly were focusing on how Crowell solicited
political campaign money from architects, engineers and bingo
operators.
   As a result of the investigation, a one-time Crowell employee,
former chief bingo inspector W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, is serving a
seven-year prison sentence on a conviction that includes extorting
payoffs from bingo operators.
   Crowell's longtime administrative assistant, Mary Sue Wright,
was named an unindicted co-conspirator in an illegally operated
Memphis bingo hall and given immunity from prosecution.
   The secretary's death followed by five months the suicide in
Knoxville of Ted Ray Miller, a state representative who reportedly
was under investigation in connection with bribes paid in
connection with legislation dealing with a Knox County incinerator
project. Miller had not been indicted.
   Crowell was elected to the Legislature in 1968, and was elected
secretary of state in 1977.

<TEXT>
   While the FBI investigates last week's
bombing death of a federal judge in Alabama, investigators here are
still puzzling over the mysterious 1987 slayings of a Biloxi judge
and his wife.
   The investigation has unearthed links among the Dixie Mafia, an
organized crime group that once flourished on Mississippi's
``Golden Gulf Coast''; a sex and extortion ring allegedly run from
a Louisiana prison; the mayor of this coastal city; and a purported
hitman sitting in a Georgia jail.
   But while there are many pieces to the puzzle, few of them fit
together.
   A federal grand jury has spent months investigating the deaths
of Circuit Judge Vincent Sherry, 58, and his wife, former Biloxi
Councilwoman Margaret Sherry, 57. So far, there have been no
indictments.
   The Sherrys were shot to death Sept. 14, 1987, in their home.
The judge was shot three times in the face, and his wife four times
in the head. Authorities said the same .22-caliber pistol was used.
   Their bodies were discovered two days later by Vincent Sherry's
former law partner, Peter Halat, who has since become mayor of
Biloxi _ and has been implicated in the crime.
   Halat worked with Sherry until Sherry was appointed judge in
1986.
   Louisiana prison inmate Bobby Joe Fabian, a convicted murderer,
has said Halat attended a 1987 meeting at the Louisiana State
Penitentiary at Angola in which the killings were plotted. Halat
angrily denied the accusations last August, saying he wasn't at the
prison when the meeting allegedly took place.
   Fabian claims the Sherrys were killed because inmates believed
the judge kept about $400,000 from an extortion scam that ran ads
in homosexual magazines and newspapers.
   Respondents to the ads were told their ``friend'' was getting
out of the Louisiana prison and needed money for airfare to meet
them. Authorities claim hundreds of thousands were taken in the
scheme.
   An alleged member of the Dixie Mafia, Kirksey McCord Nix Jr.,
has been indicted in the scam. Fabian claims that Nix, who is
serving a life sentence for killing a New Orleans grocer, was a
party to the murder plot.
   Nix, 46, said recently that he'd take a lie detector test as
long as his accusers and investigators would do the same.
   Halat said he represented Nix for nearly 10 years but severed
his ties in May 1988. He said he wouldn't comment further and
``take the chance of compromising the ongoing investigation.''
   ``Number one, I want the case solved. Number two, after it is
solved, I don't want anything to be tainted by publicity,'' Halat
said in an interview.
   Federal and state officials also are keeping mum.
   ``All I can tell you is that we've been trying to hold the press
down so we can do the job the way it ought to be done,'' said U.S.
Attorney George Phillips.
   Another person who has been linked to the case is John Elbert
Ransom, 62, of Smyrna, Ga., who allegedly was paid $35,000 to kill
the couple, according to Fabian.
   Ransom was indicted in November for the July 19 killing of
Rodney Gaddy, 33, in Coweta County, Ga. Investigators in
Mississippi have said that killing had a similar style to the
Sherry slayings.
   In 1979, Ransom was arrested on an unregistered firearm charge
after conviction of a felony and was sentenced to 14 years.
   Ransom, being held without bond in a Newnan, Ga., jail, has
recently denied that he killed the Sherrys or that he was a hitman,
but acknowledged that he knew Nix.
   While speculation persists that mob violence was involved,
others contend the hit on the Sherrys was ordered by enemies the
judge made while representing drug dealers.
   Mississippi and Louisiana authorities have refused to discuss
the details that allegedly link Ransom to the crime. But part of
the documentation comes from investigations by private investigator
Rex Armistead, hired by the Sherrys' family.
   Halat, 46, who became mayor in July, maintains the publicity
about the Sherry killings and grand jury investigation haven't hurt
the city. However, he says the reverse is true about his wife and
family.
   ``I'm a big boy. I can handle this. But who's going to pay my
wife back for the stares and whispers at the grocery store. Who's
going to pay back my children for things that are said at school?
   ``If anybody ... says that I had anything to do with that case,
I'll tell them to their face they're liars, that it's not true,''
Halat said.

<TEXT>
   Protesters took to the streets in four U.S. cities to denounce
the invasion of Panama. But many of them encountered jeers, and
unscientific surveys showed Americans overwhelmingly in favor of it.
   Scholars on Central America were mixed in their reactions.
   ``It's obvious that we don't want democracy. We want client
states,'' said John Donaghy, a member of the Central American
Solidarity Association, which organized a rally Wednesday on Boston
Common.
   About 100 people braved 29-degree temperatures and stiff winds
to attend the demonstration against the pre-dawn U.S. raid to
capture Gen. Manuel Noriega, who faces drug charges in Florida.
   About 25 people from the Rhode Island Central America Network
picketed the federal courthouse in Providence on Wednesday evening,
and about 70 demonstrators held a candlelight vigil in Baltimore.
   Kathy Schaafsma, a demonstrator in Baltimore, said she military
action was illegal and the newly installed government of elected
President Guillermo Endara was a ``puppet government'' that will
ensure U.S. control of the Panama Canal.
   About 200 people gathered in front of a U.S. Armed Services
recruiting center in New York City's Times Square before beginning
to march, chanting slogans such as ``U.S. out of Panama.''
   As they marched up the Avenue of the Americas, they were jeered
by numerous passers-by.
   `I say they're confused,'' said one passer-by, Frankie Ambrosia.
   ``I think this is more than a political thing,'' he said of the
U.S. intervention. ``This was an anti-drug thing.''
   When the protesters began chanting in Rockefeller Center, many
tourists there to view the giant Christmas tree at the skating rink
began booing at them.
   Besides the boos, other barometers bore out strong support for
the military strike.
   Cable News Network asked viewers to call one of two special 900
numbers to indicate whether they support or oppose the U.S. action
in Panama.
   The network said early today that 91 percent of more than
100,000 viewers phoning in supported U.S. intervention and 9
percent opposed it.
   Radio programs that sought opinions from listeners also found
that most callers supported President Bush's decision.
   Cincinnati radio station WLW also received more than 1,000 calls
during a 2{-hour telephone survey, with 844 supporting the invasion
and 233 opposing it.
   Ann Twinam, a Latin American historian at the University of
Cincinnati, said the perception of the invasion will be different
from criticism of other U.S. intervention in Latin America.
   ``Normally, we would suspect universal condemnation, but the
extent of the drug trade by Panama could alter that,'' she said.
   She said Panamanians did not want to settle the country's
problem themselves. ``People weren't really willing to take to the
streets. People really wanted him gone, but they weren't willing to
do it,'' she said.
   But Carlos Munoz, associate professor of Ethnic Studies at the
University of California, Berkeley, called the move the ``most
serious policy blunder since Vietnam.''
   ``I see a Vietnam War in the making,'' he said. ``I hope to God
I'm wrong in this, but I fear the worst.''
   One reason Noriega has been so difficult to remove from power,
Munoz said, is the widespread support for him in Panama.
   ``Rightly or wrongly, he has been a very respected leader in
that country,'' Munoz said. ``I don't like to see dictatorships,
but the government the United States is putting in place does not
have the support of the Panamanian people.''
   In Jacksonville, N.C., home of Camp Lejeune, many residents
approved of the strike.
   ``They (the troops) should have gone in when they had the
coup,'' Harold Schaefer, a retired Marine, said of October's failed
attempt by Panamanian officers to overthrow Noriega. ``They're
doing the right thing.''
   William Little, another retired Marine, said: ``Bush had better
not pull out until they hang him by the neck here in the U.S. ...
Bush has more guts than I gave him credit for. But I'd like to see
old Harry Truman in there now.''
   Still others were upset by the timing.
   ``I question the judgment of the president in sending these
young men into battle this close to Christmas and having them
gift-wrapped in body bags,'' said Victor Carucci, of East Amherst,
N.Y.

<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A bomb damaged the U.S. Embassy in
Bolivia, Nicaraguan troops went on alert and thousands of Cubans
reportedly protested in Havana as most of Latin America reacted
angrily to the invasion of Panama.
   Peru withdrew its U.S. ambassador, and the Organization of
American States met in emergency session Wednesday following the
pre-dawn mililtary assault aimed at deposing and seizing Panamanian
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The OAS refused to recognize the new U.S.-installed government's
representative, and instead considered a resolution condemning the
U.S. action.
   El Salvador's U.S.-backed government was the only one in Latin
American to clearly support the move.
   In La Paz, the bomb went off around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday,
destroying windows at the embassy and surrounding offices. No
injuries were reported.
   Police at the scene said there were no suspects, but the Armed
Liberation Front of Zarate Willka, a radical leftist group, claimed
responsibility.
   ``Death to the Yankee invader; our hatred is unplacable and the
war will be until death,'' the group said in a statement released
just after the bombing. ``We are fighting against aggression and
for the sovereignty of our people.''
   The group has been accused of killing two Mormon missionaries
from the United States in May and has been linked to an attempt to
kill then-U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz during an August
1988 visit.
   Peru's president, Alan Garcia, said he was pulling his
ambassador from Washington in protest. He said a drug summit
scheduled for Feb. 15 with Bush and other Latin American presidents
in Cartagena, Colombia, should be postponed as a result of the
invasion.
   Venezuela also criticized the move, but said in a communique
that lack of an ``effective and firm'' response by Latin American
nations to human rights violations and constitutional norms by
Panama's government had made it necessary.
   In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega said the invasion
threatened his Central American country, and placed troops on
maximum alert. Soviet-built tanks rumbled through Managua, at least
20 large howitzers were positioned in the capital and Red Beret
special forces went to the international airport.
   ``In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Panama, it is a threat to
the peace and security of all Latin America, Central America and
especially constitutes a serious threat to Nicaragua,'' Ortega said
in a communique read on Voice of Nicaragua radio.
   Thousands of Cubans protested the invasion by rallying outside
the Havana building that houses the U.S. interests section, the
official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said. The United States
has no embassy in Havana.
   Fidel Castro's government called on the world to unite in
denouncing the United States, the agency said.
   President Jose Sarney of Brazil said in a television interview
that the invasion was a ``step backward in international
relations.''
   Argentina offered aid to Panamanians and said it ``truly
deplores what is happening.'' It called for immediate removal of
the American troops but also described Noriega as an obstacle to
democracy.
   Chile, Mexico, Uruguay and Ecuador also deplored the U.S. move.
   Colombia did not directly comment on the invasian. But Enrique
Pennalosa, its United Nations ambassador who also chairs the U.N.
Security Council, said, ``Colombia, as a matter of principle,
rejects any armed intervention against a sovereign country.''
   El Salvador's government said the United States ``was using its
legitimate right of defense.''
   ``This type of actions could permit the Panamanian people to
identify with a democratic process, to reestablish an elected
government,'' said Vice President Francisco Merino.
   Honduras appeared to give qualified support to the U.S. move,
saying its government ``laments the declaration of a state of war
in Panama and the violent acts taken against American military and
civilians.''
   ``Honduras equally laments that the U.S. government saw it
necessary to take military action, moving away from the principle
of non-intervention, as an extreme measure to guarantee the
security of thousands of its citizens residing in Panama,'' the
Foreign Ministry statement added.
   Costa Rican Foreign Minister Rodrigo Madrigal said in a
statement that his country regretted the U.S. use of force to
``bring about an end to the crisis caused by the despotic
government of Gen. Noriega,'' but hopes that ``peace returns to
Panama with a quick restoration of a democratic government.''

<TEXT>
   The ice block on the Mississippi River has
created a traffic jam of 1,000 barges, giving some pilots time to
catch up on their reading.
   ``Right now, it's `Southern Outdoors,''' Roy East said by CB
radio Wednesday from his tugboat, tied up with 22 barges on an
island in the icy river just north of Alton. ``Mostly it's just sit
up here, and hurry up and wait.''
   A 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi, from Alton, just north of
St. Louis, down to Cairo in southern Illinois, was closed
indefinitely to barge traffic Monday night by the Coast Guard
because ice and low water had combined to make navigation unsafe.
   The shutdown comes at the slowest time of year for barge traffic
on the river, but it still worries shipping officials who fear
damage to barges stuck in and around the ice and mounting costs of
idled towboats.
   Up to 1,000 barges are sidelined in the St. Louis harbor, a
20-mile section of the river, below a huge ice bridge that has
formed just north of the city at the confluence of the Missouri
River, according to the Coast Guard. Other barges are idled
elsewhere on the river.
   Tom Garrett, the captain of the towboat Illini, docked at Alton,
said he had rarely seen such a build up at the confluence.
   ``Usually that Missouri River keeps everything pretty clear,''
Garrett said. ``I figure it's going to last a long time because
we're not going to get any hot water. I'm sure it's going to be bad
conditions until spring.''
   Charles Norman, president of the Norman Brothers Inc. barge
company, agreed.
   ``It's not fun, but it's kind of amazing to watch nature do its
thing,'' he said.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Dean Jones said there was no way to
determine when the river could re-open. He said it depended on when
temperatures warmed, the ice melted and the water level rose.
   On Wednesday, St. Louis' temperature ranged from 3 to 20
degrees. The Mississippi was 8 to 10 feet below normal.
   Jones said the river levels were lower than any time since 1940.
The last time the river was closed because of ice was in January
1977, when barge traffic was restricted for about a week, he said.
   Lt. Michael Rand of the Coast Guard's St. Louis Marine Safety
Office said a few towboats have been allowed to travel below St.
Louis, but no traffic can get through the chunky ice bridge at the
Missouri-Mississippi confluence.
   Barge operators in the St. Louis harbor have doubled up on their
lines and put out shear barges, which are barges placed at an angle
to the shore above each fleet to ward off any large, dangerous
chunks of ice that may break off the bridge.
   The ice bridge extends about two miles on the Mississippi and
about 14 miles back on the Missouri River, Rand said. He said it
had formed because there was little current from the Missouri to
keep it clear, due to record low water levels.
   On Wednesday, officials considered breaking up the jam with
dynamite. But with sub-zero temperatures expected for the next
several days, ice would simply re-form.
   ``The cold weather's coming and it will only make more ice, so
we don't know what's going to happen,'' Rand said.
   Back in Alton, Roy East had managed to pilot his Margaret O.
from Cairo to Alton before the river was closed. But he said the
Ohio River Co. is sidelining his boat because of ice problems
farther upstream on the Illinois River.
   East, interviewed by CB radio, said he was hauling coal and
scrap iron.
   ``It costs the company a lot of money, I imagine,'' he said.
``You don't make any when you're sitting here.''

<HEAD>Dollar Down In Tokyo, Stucks Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged today,
while the dollar inched down against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar finished at 143.77 yen, down 0.43 yen from
Wednesday's 144.23-yen close. The U.S. currency opened at 143.80
yen and ranged between 143.70 yen and 143.90 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 296.52 points, or 0.77
percent, ending the day at 38,215.48. It had gained 72.90 points
Wednesday.
   Dealers said the index fell as many market players remained on
the sidelines, discouraged by the continuing speculation over the
discount rate hike by the Bank of Japan.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
the index fell further in the afternoon, when major securities
firms, including Yamaichi and Nikko, sold issues for profit-taking.
   ``Investors were not in the buying mood simply because of the
discount rate rumor,'' Nomura added.
   Earlier this week, news reports said the Bank of Japan might
raise its key lending rate by 0.5 percentage points to 4.25 percent
by this weekend, which was denied by both the Finance Ministry and
central bank officials. But Kyodo News Service, quoting what it
described as a reliable source in the Bank of Japan, reported
Wednesday that the two sides would negotiate on a hike.
   Trading was moderate with first section volume estimated at 650
million shares, down from Wednesday's 1 billion.
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved narrowly after its lower
start in Tokyo in the wake of credit-easing overnight by the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board, but the action had little long-term impact
on Tokyo trading, which was inactive prior to the year-end
holidays, traders said.
   The U.S. unit ended only slightly lower than the opening rate as
participants traded the currency for position adjustments, said a
Daiwa Bank trader, speaking anonymously.
   ``Market players waited to check how the New York market
performs tonight,'' he said.
   The Fed was seen adding reserves to the U.S. banking system when
the key Federal Funds rate was at 8.4375 percent, below the 8.5
percent equilibrium rate perceived as the Fed's target. Late
Wednesday in New York, the Federal Funds rate, a short-term lending
rate between commercial banks, stood at 8.25 percent.
   An estimated $3.73 billion changed hands in spot trading, down
from $6.3 billion the previous day.

   A couple had declared their acre of land to
be without a county, but a federal judge says otherwise and now
they face the inevitable _ a $1,200 bill for back taxes.
   But Tom and Brenda Norton still haven't taken down their
hand-painted sign that reads ``Lost County. Pop. 2.''
   The Nortons bought the land from Mrs. Norton's uncle in 1986 and
paid property taxes to Jasper County. After they started a building
for their family business, Jasper County officials discovered the
land was in Newton County.
   They filed a lawsuit in 1987.
   Norton refused to pay Newton County taxes on the land for the
past three years because of the dispute. Now, county officials say
he owes $1,200.
   U.S. District Judge Robert L. Vining last week granted the
counties' request to end the matter. Officials said an independent
survey last year determined that the property was part of Newton
County in southwestern Georgia.

<HEAD>Fathers' Group Demands Equal Time With Judge Using Ads To Nab Deadbeats</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's new weapon in the war against
deadbeat dads in divorce cases has led a fathers' group to demand
equal time against mothers who violate visitation rights.
   Family Court Judge Stephen Levin spent nearly $7,000 in court
funds for a full-page ad last week in the Philadelphia Daily News,
listing 136 fathers and six mothers accused of ignoring bench
warrants for more than a year, mostly for failing to pay child
support. He warned they would go to jail if they did not respond
immediately.
   Sixty delinquent fathers and two mothers did, although they were
angry about the unexpected and unwanted publicity.
   ``They said they were petrified, angry, humiliated, and several
told me they were even afraid to show their face on the street,''
Levin said.
   While mothers congratulated the judge for his innovative
approach, it irritated a group called Fathers and Children
Equality, which claims Family Court caters far too much to mothers
and takes too long to handle child visitation violations.
   ``Why doesn't he do it to the women who are purposely keeping
their children from their fathers?'' asked Benjamin Manis, who has
experienced problems with his former wife over their 4-year-old.
``We don't get equal rights in Family Court.''
   The judge said he recognized the validity of complaints over
visitation rights, but said he was elated at the results of the ad.
   ``We got an immediate response, and we sent a strong message to
others delinquent in child support that if you don't want your name
in the paper, you better pay up,'' he said.
   Levin said he would also try to address the visitation problem.
   ``Custody is difficult to deal with and, sometimes, fathers
won't pay support because the mothers won't let them see the
children,'' the judge said.
   ``And fathers are resentful because courts don't move as swiftly
to help them as they do for mothers seeking support. In the middle,
unfortunately, are the kids, and we are there to make sure they are
taken care of.''
   What about those 76 fathers and four mothers who have ignored
the ad?
   ``I am going to get sheriff's deputies to arrest them, and I am
going to put them in prison,'' Levin said. ``I am not bluffing.''

<HEAD>Region Agrees to Work Toward Common Market For Teachers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLISON J. PUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An agreement billed as the nation's first common
market for educators has been signed by officials in seven states
seeking to draw talented teachers to the Northeast.
   ``This must be the most attractive section of the country for
teachers if we want to attract the kind of talent we are used to in
New England,'' Harold Raynolds Jr., commissioner of education in
Massachusetts, said Wednesday after the agreement was signed during
a conference here.
   The pact, which goes into effect April 1, 1990, will loosen the
certification restrictions that prohibit teachers from moving
across state lines.
   Under the plan, teachers with a Northeast Regional Credential
who move within the region would have two years to fulfill any
unmet requirements for certification in their new state of
residence.
   The states in the agreement are Massachusetts, Vermont, Rhode
Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut and New York.
   New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and the District of
Columbia also were making overtures to join the Northeast compact,
said Anne Newton, a director for The Regional Laboratory, a
federally funded educational research group which helped to develop
the agreement with the Northeast Common Market Project. California
also was watching the experiment closely, she said.
   Teacher representatives heralded the agreement as one more step
toward ``professionalizing'' education.
   ``It's very exciting and very forward-thinking,'' said Rosanne
Bacon, president of the 68,000-member Massachusetts Teachers
Association.
   Bacon said the agreement would, among other things, encourage
more competitive salaries for teachers, who could move to states
which offered them more money or benefits.
   ``We're going to have an incredible interest in people moving
from one area into an area where they are truly needed, and the
market will obviously have to reflect that, with higher salaries,''
said Bacon, who teaches at a public high school.
   With 20 years' teaching experience and two masters degrees,
Bacon said she could earn $24,000 more a year if she worked 30
miles away in Connecticut.
   Raynolds and top educators in other states insisted they were
interested in improving teaching in the region, not just in their
state.
   ``We're trying to think and act regionally,'' said Richard P.
Mills, Vermont's education commissioner.
   Not all seven states embraced the agreement wholeheartedly.
Maine has agreed to allow teachers to fulfill their requirements in
one year, instead of two.
   Connecticut agreed to accept out-of-state teachers under the
terms of the agreement only in vocational classes.

   An exhibit of Panamanian toads at the
Columbus Zoo has been pulled in the wake of the U.S. attempt to
oust Gen. Manuel Noriega from power, the zoo's director says.
   A group of zoo animals were scheduled for an appearance
Wednesday on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' as part of a Christmas
show, said Jack Hanna, zoo director. But the fighting in Panama
pre-empted coverage of the exhibit.
   Hanna, in response to the fighting, then ordered that the toads
be taken off exhibit.
   Hanna said zoo staff members had been preparing for the
television appearance since 4:30 a.m. Wednesday.
   ``ABC had brought in a satellite truck from Virginia, two
producers and a director from New York. Two cameras were ready to
roll,'' Hanna said.
   ``(Head curator) Don Winstel was standing out there with a camel
and her baby, two sheep, two goats, reindeer and a miniature
donkey,'' Hanna said.
   But the network said there would not ``be any Christmas animals
today because we're at war with Panama,'' Hanna said.
   ``I never did like that SOB Noriega; now I hate him.''

<HEAD>Osteopathic, Public and Profit-Making Hospitals Have Highest Death
Rates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The nation's most sophisticated hospitals, which
invest in the latest high-tech equipment and the best-trained
doctors and nurses, do the best job of saving sick people's lives,
a study today concludes.
   ``Our findings suggest that the resources utilized in hospitals
may have an impact on mortality,'' said Dr. Arthur J. Hartz, who
directed the study.
   He said the results may surprise many doctors, who often feel
that differences between hospitals are relatively unimportant in
patients' survival.
   The research found that hospitals are mostly likely to save
lives when a large proportion of their doctors are certified by
specialty boards and their nurses have RN degrees. The most
successful hospitals also tend to have large payrolls, high
occupancy rates and the most technologically advanced equipment.
   The study found that the lowest death rates are in private
teaching hospitals, the medical centers that train young doctors.
The highest rates were in osteopathic, public or profit-making
hospitals.
   ``All of our findings have the same possible explanation: They
reflect differences in quality,'' said Hartz, a physician at the
Medical College of Wisconsin.
   The study, based on federal statistics, is the largest to
attempt to settle a long-running debate over whether for-profit
hospitals are as good as their non-profit counterparts. While at
least two smaller studies have found no difference, the latest one
suggests that non-profit hospitals have an advantage.
   Private, non-profit hospitals had 114 deaths for every 1,000
patients. By contrast, the for-profit hospitals had 121 deaths.
   ``It could be that the physicians and nurses in the for-profit
hospitals, because of administrative pressures, deal with patients
in such a way that is detrimental to their health,'' said Dr.
Alfred A. Rimm, a co-author of the study.
   The study found that public hospitals, such as city and county
hospitals, averaged 120 deaths per 1,000 patients. The highest
death rate in all the categories studied was osteopathic hospitals,
which had 129 deaths.
   The best record was for private, non-osteopathic teaching
hospitals, which train interns and residents after medical school.
They had 108 deaths per 1,000 patients.
   ``I wouldn't go to anything but a high-tech university
hospital,'' commented Rimm.
   The study was based on 1986 data gathered on 3,100 of the
nation's nearly 6,000 hospitals by the Health Care Financing
Adminstration. The agency's latest figures, released Wednesday,
showed that 3.4 percent of all hospitals had higher-than-expected
death rates in 1988.
   The Wisconsin researchers and co-authors from the health care
administration used the figures to see how mortality rates differed
between various categories of hospitals. They adjusted the numbers
to reflect differences in the severity of illness of patients
admitted to the hospitals. The results were published in today's
issue of New England Journal of medicine.
   Michael Bromberg, head of the Federation of American Health
Systems, which represents for-profit hospitals, said the research
was flawed.
   ``This study represents an unfair comparison of hospitals that
are not alike,'' he said. ``A small rural hospital that is
for-profit is treated the same way as a big not-for-profit teaching
hospital with lots of doctors and lots of equipment for the purpose
of determining mortality. There is no way you can make such a
comparison and have it mean anything.''
   Martin Wall, senior vice president of the American Osteopathic
Hospital Association, noted that the nation's 160 osteophatic
hospitals fit into several of the other categories studied,
including for-profit and non-profit, teaching and non-teaching.
   ``Making our hospitals a separate category is inappropriate,''
he said.
   Doctors of osteopathy prescribe drugs, perform surgery and
receive the same training as medical doctors. They also believe
that disturbances of muscles and bones can underly disease, and
perform massage and other manipulation as part of their treatment.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   What started out to be a routine traffic stop
for speeding turned into brush with death for an Arizona policeman,
who was saved by a passerby.
   As Russell E. Dean tried to arrest the 16-year-old driver, the
boy knocked the Phoenix officer to the ground, grabbed his gun and
threatened to kill him. Dean believes his life was spared only by
the bravery of the motorist who stopped his own car, grabbed the
boy and pulled him from the policeman.
   The passer-by, John W. Basey, 40, a window washer from Phoenix,
was among 20 people honored by the Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Hero
Fund Commission for risking their lives trying to save others.
   ``Mr. Basey walked right up in the face of that gun that could
have gone off at any time,'' Dean said. ``I believe Mr. Basey saved
my life.''
   Those honored Wednesday bring to 111 the number recognized this
year. The organization has honored 7,405 North Americans since
industrialist Andrew Carnegie established the commission in 1904.
   Each hero or survivor receives a $2,500 cash reward and medal.
   Dean said he almost quit pursuing the youth he was chasing on
July 19. The youth reached speeds of 80 mph on Phoenix's streets
before crashing his car into a tree.
   When Dean stopped to apprehend the boy, the teen-ager turned on
the motorcycle officer and fell on him. The boy pulled Dean's
.38-caliber pistol from his holster and pointed it at his head.
   ``He put the gun right to my left eye and he said he was going
to kill me,'' Dean said.
   As Basey talked the 16-year-old into releasing the gun, Dean
handcuffed him. Dean suffered only a sprained knee and scrapes to
his arms and legs.
   The other heroes cited:
   _Derek Lambert, 16, of Andrews, S.C., who saved a man who had
fallen from a boat and severely cut his hands on the propeller on
Oct. 9, 1988.
   _Milton E. Bradford, 32, of Newport, N.J., who died saving a
co-worker who was overcome by gas in a sewer shaft on Sept. 6, 1988.
   _Shirley Belle Viscusi, 58, Howick, Quebec, a nurse who died
trying to save a woman who suffocated in a home for the elderly
that had caught fire on July, 25, 1988.
   _Michael B. LaRiviere, 18, Rockaway, Ore., who died while
swimming to save a man caught in an ocean current on July 30.
   _Martin A. Benfield, 27, Lenoir, N.C., who nearly drowned
pulling two young boys out of the ocean June 14, 1988.
   _Leonard A. Theroux, 65, Chepachet, R.I., who pulled a trapped
man from his burning auto before the vehicle became engulfed in
flames on Feb. 18.
   _Aaron Lorne Clark, 25, Magdalen Islands, Quebec, who drowned
while helping to save a 13-year-old girl in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on Aug. 21, 1986.
   _Jerry L. Conrad, 35, Toledo, Ohio, who leaped into a moving car
to save a 2-year-old girl on Sept. 23, 1987.
   _Jerry O. Anderson, 35, Tulsa, Okla., who drowned while saving a
12-year-old boy who had fallen from a dam into deep water on May 27.
   _Allen N. Davidson, 13, Gaffney, S.C., who crawled into a
burning house and dragged an elderly woman to safety on Nov. 19,
1988.
   _Michael Ollins, 33, Chicago, a bus driver who left his vehicle
and stopped a group of young men from beating a man on a crowded
city street on Aug. 20, 1987.
   _Claude Cleroux, 50, Montreal; Serge Perron, 38, of Repentigny,
Quebec; and Robert K. Myles, 37, of St. Hillaire, Quebec, all of
whom helped save a co-worker trapped beneath a crumbling wall after
an explosion in an oil refinery on December 16, 1986.
   _Scott Walter Asson, 20, Burley, Idaho, who broke the window of
a car and pulled a woman free just before the auto was submerged in
a flooded wash in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Oct. 14, 1988.

<HEAD>Mailer Upset About Mention in Broadway Play ``Tru''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Norman Mailer is upset about a line in
the new one-man Broadway play ``Tru'' that alludes to a 29-year-old
incident in which the writer allegedly stabbed his wife.
   Mailer said in a letter to co-producer Lewis Allen that the
reference was ``kind of crass,'' according to today's editions of
The New York Times.
   ``It's an ugly line designed to cater to rich out-of-town
yahoos,'' Mailer wrote to Allen, who also is husband of the
playwright, Jay Presson Allen.
   The line that irked Mailer is spoken in the first act by the
Truman Capote character, who is worried about his popularity in
1975 after a story of his was published in Esquire magazine.
   Capote, played by Robert Morse, is talking on the telephone and
tells his lecture agent's secretary:
   ``Listen, hon. When Irene gets back in, ask her when Norman
Mailer stabbed his wife, how much his fee went up.''
   The line refers to when Mailer allegedly stabbed his second
wife, Adele Morales, with a penknife after an all-night party at
his Manhattan apartment in November 1960. She declined to press
charges.
   In reply, Mrs. Allen wrote Mailer: ``A pretty poor show, kid,
for someone who over three decades has assiduously worked at
creating the very public image of a provocateur, a tough guy who
takes on all comers, a mythic brawler.
   ``But when a small shot comes your way, you toss your curls and
sob `foul.'''

<HEAD>Central American Natives in U.S. Mixed in Reaction to Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Central American natives living in the United
States reacted to the U.S. military invasion of Panama with
feelings from ecstatic relief to condemnation.
   About 200 members of Miami's Panamanian exile community
celebrated the U.S. action to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
after a prayer vigil in the city's Coconut Grove section.
   ``Viva Bush, he brought down Noriega, he brought down the rat,''
they chanted, unfurling a 15-foot Panamanian flag.
   ``I'm here to thank the Lord for the American invasion,'' said
one Panamanian at the gathering, Jeanne Friend. ``Because that's
what I really wanted _ for the Americans to come in and take hold
of Noriega.''
   But in Los Angeles, a native of El Salvador denounced the
invasion.
   ``The time has long passed when the United States had to be the
police force for South America,'' said Mario Rivas, spokesman for
Our Lady Queen of Angels church. ``My reaction is: United States,
get out of Panama. Let Panamanians work the situation out for
themselves.''
   Rivas, a Salvadoran refugee who came to the United States eight
years ago, said several Panamanian refugees told him they were
outraged by the attack.
   ``I hope the invasion fails because it's imperial thirst to
conquer foreign lands,'' Rivas said. ``That's not democracy. Let's
practice democratic ways and means.''
   In Miami, Ivan Chacon, who was beaten by Noriega supporters in
attacks on opposition candidates after Panama's elections in May,
had a different view. He said U.S. intervention was the only way to
bring democracy to his homeland.
   ``The people couldn't bring (Noriega) down waving little white
handkerchiefs,'' Chacon said.
   Aurelio Barria, who last year headed the anti-Noriega opposition
until he was forced into exile in Miami, said Panamanians would
blame Noriega for the bloodshed, not the United States.
   ``It's a mixed feeling _ we have been fighting so long through
non-violent ways to get Noriega out,'' Barria said. ``But he just
became a psychopath _ he went a few steps beyond the limit.''
   ``We aren't happy that our country has been invaded,'' said
Roberto Dominguez, the former Panamanian counsul in Miami. ``But it
is an action to get rid of someone who has held our country
hostage.''
   At the rally, Susana Toral wept with joy.
   ``I cry for not being there,'' she said, ``I left Panama because
I was afraid, but I don't want to live here. I want to return to my
Panama.''
   Luis Endara, a cousin of Panama's new President Guillermo
Endara, said the longing to return home remains great among the
estimated 5,000 to 7,000 members of Miami's Panamanian community.
   ``We will probably see for the first time an emigration back to
a country that has been liberated,'' Endara said.
   Adela Bonilla de Giroldi, widow of Maj. Moises Giroldi, the
leader of a failed Panamanian military coup against Noriega on Oct.
3, said her feelings were mixed. Her husband was killed after
troops loyal to the general rallied. Some accounts said Noriega
shot Giroldi.
   ``I am glad that my husband is dead,'' Mrs. Giroldi said,
``because if he had been there today, I am sure he would have died
defending his barracks.''
   The U.S. intervention ``is not the best way, but it had to be
done,'' she said.
   In Texas, the nation's largest Hispanic rights organization came
out strongly in favor of the U.S. military strike.
   ``We stand squarely behind our commander in chief on this
issue,'' said Jose Garcia De Lara, president of the San
Antonio-based League of United Latin American Citizens. ``What
we're doing here is getting rid of a hooligan that is causing great
turmoil in our hemisphere.''

<HEAD>Reaction Mixed to British Nationality Package for Hong Kong</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan in Britain to give residency rights to
225,000 people from Hong Kong received mixed reviews today, with
some arguing it would be too narrow to be of much help to the
colony before China takes over in 1997.
   ``A little that will not go very far,'' read the headline over
The Hong Kong Standard newspaper's editorial on the package.
   The nationality plan, announced Wednesday by British Foreign
Secretary Douglas Hurd, is designed to prevent 50,000 key Hong Kong
residents and their families from emigrating before the colony
reverts to China.
   He argued that giving important people in the civil service,
business and the professions the right to live in Britain was
essential to persuade them to not join the ``brain drain'' of top
white-collar workers leaving because of concern over impending
Communist Chinese rule.
   China's promise that Hong Kong can maintain its capitalist
system for 50 years and enjoy a high degree of autonomy has met
with widespread skepticism here, particularly after the bloody
suppression of spring pro-democracy protests in Beijing.
   Hong Kong's governor, Sir David Wilson, praised the plan as
helping ``create the sort of stability and the reassurances for a
substantial number of people which we have been looking for.''
   Honor Hong Kong, a group of top business leaders formed to press
for right of residency in Britain, also welcomed the package as
encouraging key white-collar staff to remain in the territory.
   ``We argued for more, we should have been given more; but this
figure - we believe _ is a basis on which to rebuild confidence in
our economy,'' said Simon Murray, the group's chairman.
   Murray noted that a private study released last week estimated
as many as 315,000 key workers were essential to maintaining Hong
Kong's vibrant economy.
   Community leaders on the colony's Legislative Council who have
long argued that the right of residency should be granted to all
3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese eligible for British passports vowed
to pressure London to broaden the program.
   Some expressed worries the plan will divide the community as
only 4 percent of the colony's 5.7 million people will qualify.
Fears also were voiced that the offer will not stop the brain drain.
   The lobbying group British Citizens for Hong Kong issued a
statement saying the plan ``will have no effect in stemming the
outflow and ... is a divisive and dishonorable gesture of dismissal
by Britain ...''
   Wong-hyo, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants'
Association, was quoted by the Standard as saying the package was
``inadequate to keep up morale and retain staff.''
   Although the Xinhua News Agency, China's official representative
in the colony, refused to comment on the package, a newspaper that
often reflects Beijing's thinking was critical of the plan.
   The Chinese-language Wen Wei Po argued that the package showed
Britain was only concerned with maintaining the territory's
prosperity until 1997.
   ``If the society is divided into two types of people who have
different futures and benefits, it would be very difficult for them
to unite and live through the transitional period and the years
after,'' the paper said in an editorial.
   ``To solve Hong Kong's confidence crisis, Hong Kong people
should develop trust in themselves'' and put into effect the ``one
country, two systems'' policy China has promised for the territory,
it said.

   Gen. Manuel Noriego would be treated as any other
criminal defendant _ ``no more, no less,'' said the federal judge
handling the ousted Panamanian leader's drug trial.
   But 80 miles to the north, in West Palm Beach, another federal
judge on Wednesday postponed the cocaine importation trial of three
men after agreeing with defense attorneys' contention that the trio
could not receive a fair trial because of the U.S. military action
in Panama.
   Noriega and 16 associates face federal drug-trafficking
indictments returned last year by grand juries in Miami and Tampa.
   ``If General Noriega is apprehended and brought here for
trial,'' U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said Wednesday,
``he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused
of a crime _ no more, no less.
   ``All his rights will be protected,'' the Miami trial judge said
in the February 1988 Miami indictment against Noriega.
   In West Palm Beach, Judge James C. Paine postponed the trial of
two U.S. citizens and a Colombian national charged with smuggling
more than 25 pounds of cocaine into south Florida.
   Paine agreed with defense arguments that accused drug
traffickers cannot receive a fair trial when the United States has
just invaded a country to apprehend someone accused of the same
crime.
   Paine said it might be ``difficult, if not impossible, to get a
jury seated that would give (the three) a fair trial.''
   Noriega remained at large today. The United States has issued a
$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest. If he is
caught, federal officials confirmed that extremely tight security
has been included in plans drawn up to handle his arrival.
Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   After being flown to an unspecified military base in south
Florida, Noriega would be transferred to a ``secure location'' to
await the Miami trial, according to an official for the U.S.
Marshals Service.
   Two Noriega attorneys in Miami said if their client was
cornered, he would rather die than surrender.
   ``He's a fighter,'' said Miami attorney Raymond Takiff. The
attorney said he last spoke with Noriega Monday evening, and
remained in touch with the general's aides on Wednesday.
   Attorney Frank Rubino agreed.
   ``The general is alive, well and somewhere in Panama,'' Rubino
said, ``and he is on top of the situation, as far as leading his
forces.''
   Noriega is charged in the indictments with accepting bribes of
$10 million from drug traffickers of Colombia's Medellin Cartel to
protect smugglers and cocaine shipments, launder cash and supply
drug laboratories.
   If convicted, he faces up to 145 years in prison and more than
$1.1 million in fines.

   Winter officially began this afternoon, but it seems like it's
already been here for a while for much of the nation already
shivering under frigid temperatures.
   Temperatures dropped to well below zero from Wyoming to
Michigan, and wind chills were expected today to be as low as 80
below in North Dakota, 75 below in Minnesota and 65 below in
Missouri.
   Snow fell early today throughout the Midwest, blanketing parts
of Missouri, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and Indiana.
   A cold front continued to move south across the nation's
midsection Wednesday afternoon. The southern edge of the cold air
extended across western New York, central Ohio, southwest Indiana,
northeast Missouri, southwest Iowa, north-central Kansas, northeast
Colorado, northwest Wyoming and north-central Montana.
   The cold air was expected to reach northern Texas and northern
Louisiana today, and to invade North Carolina and northern Georgia
by Friday. A ``major freeze'' was predicted across the lower Rio
Grande Valley of Texas from tonight until Saturday.
   Winter storm warnings for heavy snow and wind were posted today
for much of Michigan and northwest Pennsylvania. About a foot of
snow was forecast for northwest upper Michigan. Snow also fell
early today over Pittsburgh.
   Winter officially arrived at 4:22 p.m. EST today.
   Snow showers were scattered in central New England Wednesday
evening. Snow also fell in western New York, northwest
Pennsylvania, northeast Ohio, Michigan, northern Indiana, northern
Illinois, Wisconsin, southern Minnesota, Iowa, northern Missouri,
southern and western South Dakota, eastern and northern Nebraska,
northeast Kansas, and parts of Wyoming, Montana and Washington
state.
   The high temperature for the Lower 48 states Wednesday was 84
degrees in Florida at Hollywood, Homestead and Miami.

   Two former Jim Bakker associates accused
of lying to a grand jury have been released on $25,000 bond pending
their trials.
   Evangelist John Wesley Fletcher, whose introduction of Jessica
Hahn to Bakker led to the scandal that destroyed the television
ministry, and the Rev. Sam Johnson, former pastor of the Heritage
Church at PTL, were both released following a brief hearing
Wednesday.
   Fletcher is accused of lying to a grand jury about why he
introduced Ms. Hahn to Bakker in 1980, and Johnson is accused of
lying to the same grand jury about the source of a $10,000 loan he
made to one of Bakker's aides that eventually was given to Ms. Hahn.
   Johnson's arraignment was scheduled for Jan. 16.
   Fletcher appeared without an attorney before U.S. Magistrate
Paul Taylor, who imposed several conditions for his release,
including surrendering his passport and refraining from the use of
alcohol and narcotics.
   Fletcher recently was arrested twice in one night in Durham on
charges of driving while impaired.
   ``My life has been in such shambles these past three years,''
Fletcher said as he left the federal courthouse in downtown
Charlotte.
   Taylor said he would appoint counsel for Fletcher after the
evangelist told the magistrate: ``I have nothing, sir, except the
clothes on my back.''
   Taylor did not schedule Fletcher's arraignment because he said
it will take about a week to appoint counsel.
   Johnson faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each
of 12 perjury counts. Fletcher could face the same sentence on one
perjury count.

<HEAD>Pentagon: No Major Withdrawal from Pacific Bases Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. military officials say they are not
actively considering a major military withdrawal from East Asia,
although Pentagon planners recently drafted a memorandum outlining
such a possibility.
   The Asahi Shimbun and Washington Post reported this week that
Pentagon officials were considering closing U.S. bases in the
Philippines and withdrawing forces from South Korea and Japan.
   That policy was outlined in a paper discussed at a meeting
Monday involving Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but many other
options also were discussed, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
   One source said that no such withdrawal was being considered for
the next two or three years.
   U.S. Pacific forces include 222,238 personnel _ 50,000 in Japan,
45,000 in Hawaii, 32,000 in South Korea, and 34,000 at sea,
according to Pentagon statistics. Additionally, the United States
operates two important bases in the Philippines.

<HEAD>Concern Over Polluted Parks Hoped to Help Clean Air Act</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air pollution is taking its toll on national
parks and wilderness areas, says a lawmaker who expects that
concern over removing the dangerous haze will produce bipartisan
support for strengthening the Clean Air Act.
   ``I believe that when the public learns the extent of the damage
to our natural and cultural heritage, there will be strong
bipartisan support for our efforts,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said
Wednesday at a news conference.
   Wyden is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
which early next year will take up clean air legislation. The full
Senate is also expected to take up such legislation soon after it
reconvenes in late January.
   Wyden said he wants to amend the act to strengthen the
protections for the national parks and other public treasures.
Although the 1977 Clean Air Act contains such an amendment, the
Environmental Protection Agency has not enforced it fully, he said.

<HEAD>Cajun Food Recalled by Producer</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 pounds of a frozen pork and rice
product is being recalled by a Louisiana processor because it might
be contaminated with a food-poisoning organism, Listeria
monocytogenes, according to the Agriculture Department.
   Bodin Foods Inc. of New Iberia, La., sells the product through
small distributors in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and
Texas.
   It is sold frozen in vacuum-sealed plastic packages with the
name ``Boo Dan (Boudin Link) Traditional Cajun Pudding'' on the
label, and ``Est. 8214'' printed inside the USDA inspection seal on
the label.
   A USDA spokesman said Wednesday the product is cooked pork and
rice wrapped in a sausage casing, or link.
   Listeriosis was described as ``a rare but potentially serious''
disease. Most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems,
including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill.
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache, and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea. In newborns, symptoms include respiratory
distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.

   A federal jury convicted an Alabama
state legislator of taking money to influence legislation, but
acquitted two others of accepting bribes from a union official.
   After almost three days of deliberations, jurors on Wednesday
found Rep. Pat Davis guilty of four counts and innocent of four
others. Reps. John Rogers and Jim Wright were found innocent on two
counts each. All three are Democrats.
   Mrs. Davis refused to comment after the verdict, and friends
rushed her away from the federal courthouse.
   But Rogers was jubilant after the verdict. ``Yes, there is a
Santa Claus. It's the best Christmas present in my life,'' he said.
   The lawmaker said he would return immediately to work in the
Legislature, which is meeting in special session.
   Wright declined to comment after being acquitted.
   So far this year, six Jefferson County legislators have been
indicted, but five have been acquitted. A jury at Montgomery
several weeks ago acquitted three other legislators of extortion
charges in connection with an attempt to establish a dog track.
   U.S. District Judge James Hancock set sentencing for Mrs. Davis
on Jan. 25. The maximum possible penalty is 20 years and $250,000
on each of the four counts.
   The jury convicted her of taking $12,000 from a union official,
$1,200 for her hotel expenses during legislative sessions in
Montgomery, $1,000 in ``appreciation'' money, and $5,000 to
reintroduce a failed coal bill.
   Mrs. Davis, as were Rogers and Wright, was acquitted of a
conspiracy count, and she was cleared of charges she took $400 to
pay for a barbecue, $500 as a Christmas gift and $500 in
fund-raising money.
   Rogers and Wright also were acquitted of charges they accepted
$5,000 payments.
   The government contended the three lawmakers accepted about
$30,000 for their support of a bill that would have required
Alabama utilities and state agencies to buy coal mined within the
state.
   A United Mine Workers Union official, John W. Stewart, testified
that Mrs. Davis solicited a bribe from him. Stewart became an FBI
informant and, he said, set up various meetings with the lawmakers,
paying them with money provided by the FBI in its sting operation.
   Defense attorneys said the defendants accepted the cash only as
legal campaign contributions.

   The dollar fell against most major currencies this
morning in quiet European trading.
   Gold prices were also lower.
   The developments in Panama have had only a limited impact on the
dollar and unless the crisis escalates, the dollar won't receive
much support, traders said.
   ``The dollar market is very flat,'' said a Milan trader. ``The
Panama situation could help the dollar if it aggravates, but I
don't think so.''
   Dealers said the dollar was weakened by continued bullish
sentiment for the West German mark.
   ``There's no fundamental incentive to buy dollars while the mark
is so strong,'' said a dealer at a large European bank in Frankfurt.
   Volume is very low with activity limited to some last minute
commercial orders before the end of the year, traders said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.46 yen to a closing 143.77 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a slightly higher rate of 143.80
yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7312 West German marks, down from 1.7355
   _1.5588 Swiss francs, up from 1.5585
   _5.9137 French francs, down from 5.9165

   _1,290.50 Italian lire, up from 1,288.00
   _1.1590 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1625
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6095 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.6052 late
Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.70 a troy ounce,
down from $413.50 bid late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's
five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $412.80, down from $413.00 bid late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 70 cents to close at a bid $411.34.
   Silver was selling in London at a bid price of $5.57 a troy

   A Chinese man jailed after he and his
pregnant wife entered the United States illegally to flee a forced
abortion in China hopes a presidential order will bring him freedom.
   Li Jin Lin's case is one of the first in the nation to test
President Bush's directive that says fear of forced sterilization
or abortion can be considered as grounds for granting an alien
political asylum.
   The directive, though not specifically for Chinese, was part of
Bush's Nov. 30 order allowing many Chinese citizens to remain in
the United States indefinitely after the massacre of pro-democracy
demonstrators in Beijing.
   Li, 37, and his wife, Wang Sai Zhen, fled their hometown of
Fuzhou after she became pregnant with the couple's second child.
   Ms. Wang had been forced to have several abortions after the
birth of her first daughter, now 10, because Chinese law limits
most families to one child. She feared for her health if forced to
undergo another, said Patrick W.H. Wesp, Li's lawyer. The daughter
remains in China with relatives.
   The Lis entered the United States from Canada last March, but
the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service caught them in
Albany and returned Li, 37, to Canada. Ms. Wang, whose age was
unavailable, was allowed to remain because of her advanced
pregnancy and gave birth to a girl in New York City.
   Li and his nephew, Chun Kong Cheung, tried once more to get into
the United States, but border officers found them in the back of a
tractor-trailer at the Peace Bridge on Oct. 14, Wesp said.
   The couple now fears harassment and worse if they should be
returned to China, and their daughter could suffer even though she
is a U.S. citizen by virtue of her birth here, said Kathleen Rimar,
a lawyer representing them before the INS.
   ``Our research indicates that individuals who have had two
children face sterilization in China,'' Rimar said. ``The child
would never have any advantages in her life. She would be cut out
of schooling, any chance at a job.''
   She said Bush's directive ``doesn't grant people asylum but it
gives them a better shot if they can prove they would be forced to
abort or face sterilization.'' She added that it should apply even
though the Lis were caught before the order was issued.
   John J. Ingham, acting district director of the INS, said the
Lis are the first refugees in the Buffalo area to claim asylum
because of their country's family-planning laws. Rimar and Wesp
said that as far as they know, it is the first such case in the
country.
   Li and his nephew are in jail awaiting trial on criminal charges
of conspiracy to enter the United States illegally, Ingham said.
   He said the family should have requested political asylum at the
border, but Rimar said the Lis neither speak English nor understand
immigration law.
   ``They don't even know the word asylum,'' Rimar said.

   The Communist Party voted today to
immediately disband the despised paramilitary People's Militia in
another concession to the country's increasingly powerful
pro-democracy movement.
   The delegates' vote came at a special party congress aimed at
shoring up the party's plummeting popularity, the state-run news
agency CTK reported.
   The paramilitary force, which had been under the direct control
of the party, was disarmed on Dec. 3 and its weapons stored in army
warehouses.
   The militia last acted in January when it helped riot police
suppress a weeklong series of demonstrations in Prague.
   Disbanding the militia was among the earliest demands of the
pro-democracy movement, which began rallying hundreds of thousands
of Czechoslovaks last month and has since won broad reforms from
the party and government.
   Delegates were expected to elect a new Central Committee by the
close of the congress late today.
   Falling in line with the reform movement in Eastern Europe,
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party on Wednesday replaced its top
leaders with men who accept that the party will no longer enjoy
unquestioned supremacy.
   Delegates at the special party congress also apologized for the
harsh repression of the past. Today, they were expected to approve
a program aimed at bringing democratic socialism to Czechoslovakia.
   On Wednesday, the delegates sent a clear message that they want
a clean break with the hard-line policies of the past by dumping
party boss Karel Urbanek. He had served less than a month in the
post.
   The delegates gave the job to former Premier Ladislav Adamec,
who arranged the first official negotiations with opposition leader
Vaclav Havel.
   Urbanek, who served less than a month, was viewed as too closely
associated with the hard-line leadership that was ousted by the
``gentle revolution'' that has brought to an end four decades of
one-party tyranny.
   The delegates also elected Politburo member Vasil Mohorita first
secretary. Mohorita was a key negotiator in talks with the
opposition that led to the nation's first non-Communist dominated
government in 41 years.
   The chairmanship, the more powerful of the two posts, is
responsible for dealings with other political forces, which are
expected to increase as the country moves toward its first free
elections in 43 years.
   They are to be held in June or July.
   ``I'm aware things won't be easy in the future,'' Adamec told
the delegates in his acceptance speech.
   He said he took the job out of feelings of responsibility for
correcting the mistakes of the past, and he told the 1,500
delegates that their principal task was to ``not let the party
disintegrate.''
   The delegates also passed a resolution apologizing for harsh
policies after the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   ``We apologize to our youth and all citizens afflicted by
unjustified repression,'' the resolution said.
   Last month, the party re-evaluated its stance on the period,
condemning the Soviet-led invasion. It was one of a series of
dramatic policy reversals made in response to the popular revolt.
   A top Communist official also delivered an apology on live
television Wednesday night.
   ``The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia apologizes to the
Czechoslovak people for its past policies,'' said Evzen Prusa, a
member of a working group responsible for guiding the Congress.
``It also apologizes for the events following 1968 and for
expelling and harassing the innocent.''
   In late November, the party ousted hard-line leader Milos Jakes
and others responsible for the crackdown after 1968. Jakes also was
among former leaders behind the 1970 expulsion of half a million
people from the party including Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the
1968 reforms.
   The party said his most recent failure was being responsible for
the brutal police crackdown on peaceful demonstrations Nov. 17 that
ignited the mass movement for an end to authoritarian rule.
   In a speech that illustrated the party's current crisis, Urbanek
told the congress that it had lost 66,290 of its 1.7 million
members in the past month.
   About 1,000 new members have joined, including 143 people purged
from the party after the 1968 invasion who were recently
rehabilitated, he said.

   The paramilitary squads called
Dignity Battalions that comprise Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's most
loyal supporters have been training for more than a year to fight a
U.S. invasion.
   Hundreds of the volunteers have been drilled in the handling of
M-16 rifles, jogged over rugged roads, cheered their homeland and
jeered the Yankees they predicted they would one day have to battle.
   At 1 a.m. Wednesday, when U.S. troops in armored personnel
carriers and warplanes attacked Panamanian bases, the Dignity
Battalions went into action.
   Brigades mobilized in the streets and soon after the first shots
were fired a group of men in civilian clothes carrying assault
rifles stormed the luxury Marriott Hotel and rounded up a dozen
foreign guests.
   They threatened to kill their captives but eventually released
them unharmed.
   As U.S. troops gained control of the major garrisons, many
fleeing officers of the regular armed forces _ known as the
Panamanian Defense Forces _ joined up with Dignity Battalions.
   ``We are acting as urban guerrillas, although we have lost some
positions, some garrisons,'' Enrique Thompson, second-in-command of
the battalions, told an Associated Press reporter Wednesday.
   Carrying Soviet-made AK-47 rifles, five men with him took up
positions in bushes near the Tinajitas garrison, which American
troops had seized.
   ``The people are joining the struggle for national
sovereignty,'' Thompson said.
   A national radio network broadcast called on the Dignity
Battalions to shoot at U.S. helicopters flying over Tinajitas ``and
not let them descend.''
   In another broadcast, a military officer ordered the battalions
to conduct small operations, mix with non-combatant supporters and
attack enemy positions on the edge of the city after dark.
   The paramilitary units were formed after the United States began
increasing its troop strength in the former Panama Canal Zone in
March 1988.
   Even then, the government predicted the United States would
invade to oust Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on
federal drug trafficking charges.
   Many Dignity Battalion volunteers who attended training sessions
were women. Most were in their late teens or early 20s.
   At a 1988 drill visited by a reporter, trainees shouted,
``Sovreignty, Sovreignty. Together we fight for the homeland.''
   Some battalions have been said to have more than 1,000 members,
others a few hundred. There is no reliable estimate of the total.
   ``What we are saying to North America is that when you invade,
we are ready,'' said one young man at the 1988 session.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. says it is
immediately pulling off the market a toy that simulates a rocket
booster blowing up.
   Four Boise children had complained the toy represented ``sick
humor'' after the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger.
   Sears spokesman Gordon Jones said Wednesday in an interview from
Chicago that the Building Blaster toy is ``removed from sale. We
will not fill orders.''
   Jones said the toy was pulled ``out of concern that we may have
offended some customers.'' He said the company had as many as 100
complaints.
   The sons of Christa and Gary Sanders _ Jared, 13, Seth, 9,
Spencer, 5, and Cody, 3 _ spotted the toy in the Sears holiday
Wishbook catalog and wrote Sears and President Bush to complain.
   ``We don't want children learning to blow up space shuttles!''
they wrote.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration got the
Sanders' letter to Bush and submitted a complaint of its own to
Sears.
   Jared praised the withdrawal of the product, but said, ``That's
something they should have thought of earlier.''
   The toy, available only through the toy catalog, was advertised
in the Wishbook as ``simulating a countdown gone awry. Construct
the rocket pad and prepare missile for launch. Ticking timer
detonation device destroys the entire structure.''
   John Bohach, a vice president of the manufacturer, Kenner
Products Inc., said from Cincinnati that the company had no
intention of equating the toy with the Challenger. He said the
company found that ``kids like to build things and like to knock
them down.''
   Jones said two other toys in the Building Blaster series, a
communications tower and a bridge, also are withdrawn.

   A former police official suspected in the
disappearance of money from a secret $1.4 million Police Department
fund was arrested on fraud charges today.
   Kenneth Weiner, a former civilian deputy chief who resigned in
1986 amid allegations of a pyramid scheme, was arrested as he
stepped off a flight from Los Angeles about 12:15 a.m., the FBI
said. He awaited a bail hearing today.
   The FBI charged Weiner with wire fraud in a 1986 precious metals
investment scheme in which Detroit investors lost thousands of
dollars. Officials refused to say how they learned of his travel
plans.
   Weiner had dropped from sight in recent weeks as the FBI and
city officials looked into the $1.4 million fund used for
undercover narcotics operations. Weiner had access to the fund from
1980 to 1986 while deputy chief.
   Police Chief William Hart has accused Weiner of diverting
hundreds of thousands of dollars from the fund and funneling money
into phony corporations in California. Records also show a phony
California corporation connected to Weiner paid $72,000 rent on a
Beverly Hills home occupied by Hart's daughter and her husband.
   Weiner has not been charged in the disappearance of the money.
   Hart has said he was unaware of problems with the fund,
including the rent payments for his daughter, until recently.
   Mayor Coleman Young reluctantly turned records of the fund over
to city auditors this week, but some documents needed to trace
money were missing.
   Young initially maintained that turning over the records could
jeopardize undercover operations.
   Last week, the FBI raided Weiner's apartment in Ann Arbor and
seized boxes of documents.

<HEAD>Cheney Holds Out Prospect of Partial Withdrawal By Christmas</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Breaks into 2 takes; new material throughout on Smithsonian
Institution hostages, further congressional, Cheney and Noriega comment;
combat reports from Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the
prospect today that some American forces could be withdrawn from
Panama by Christmas even though Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, a $1
million bounty on his head, evaded a huge military manhunt.
   The Pentagon issued a new report on casualties from the massive
invasion intended to usher in a ``new democratic government'' in
Panama and wipe out Noriega: 18 U.S. servicemen killed, 117 wounded
and one missing. There was also one American civilian death, that
of a woman teacher.
   At least a dozen Americans were held hostage by Noriega's forces
and the Smithsonian Institution said 11 scientists and technicians
were missing from a research institute and believed taken hostage.
   ``Given the size of the operation and its complexity, and the
opposition that's been encountered, the level of casualties is
probably lower than would have been expected,'' the defense
secretary said on CNN.
   ``I think within the next few weeks we'll be able to return the
situation back to where we're relying only on those (U.S.) forces
that were in the country prior to the intervention,'' he added.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
most of the military objectives had been accomplished. ``We are
seeing a mopping up-type activity,'' he said.
   Powell said reports of Noriega's whereabouts had been received
throughout the night and were chased down _ but without results.
   ``We do not know where he is,'' Powell said on ABC-TV's ``Good
Morning America.''
   While President Bush drew broad support from Congress, there
were hints that the political backing might erode if the military
deployment turns out to be a prolonged one.
   ``Both the president and the Congress, I think, assume that this
is going to be an operation that will be concluded as soon as
possible,'' said House Speaker Tom Foley, D-Wash., on CBS-TV's
``This Morning.''
   Deep skepticism about the operation came from Rep. Charles B.
Rangel, D-N.Y.: ``We've been waiting for some darn excuse to invade
Panama.''
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., said, ``Things had reached the
edge. The president had to act.''
   In all, Bush ordered 9,500 soldiers and Marines into Panama to
bolster the 13,000 already based there.
   Cheney said the Americans were beginning to get telephone calls
in response to the $1 million reward for the capture of Noriega
that was posted Wednesday night at the end of the first day of the
American intervention.
   ``So hopefully we'll be able to wrap up Mr. Noriega in the near
future and return him to the United States for trial,'' Cheney said.
   He expressed the belief that Noriega had not left Panama.
   Noriega and 16 associates were indicted in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., last year on drug-trafficking charges.
   Powell said he was not worried about Noriega still being ``at
liberty'' since he wielded no power any longer. ``He no longer
controls the drug money and he no longer is in a position to give
out his favors or his punishments,'' the general said.
   Reports from Panama said American forces had met stiff
resistance during the night, with heavy fighting raging just before
dawn in the middle-class suburb of San Miguelito but by daybreak,
the fighting had ceased. U.S. army troops patrolled the streets of
Panama City, but were unable to prevent widespread looting.
   In an interview on ``CBS This Morning,'' Cheney was pressed
about when U.S. units might be withdrawn.
   ``I wouldn't want to make a hard and fast projection,'' he
replied.
   ``I would guess that some of the units may be out by Christmas
but I think the key thing is for us to make certain that the
situation's under control, that the new government of Panama, the
democratic government, is well established, and a lot of that we
can do with forces that are permanently in Panama.
   ``But we won't take anybody out until we're confident that in
fact the situation's under control,'' Cheney added.
   In Panama, Noriega said on a government-run FM radio station
that he will now lead a guerrilla war against the United States.
``We're in trench warfare now and we will maintain the
resistance,'' he said. ``Our slogan is to win or die, not one step
back.''
   Powell said the chief U.S. goal today would be to locate
Americans who were taken hostage by forces loyal to Noriega in the
chaotic opening hours of the operation.

   Dozens of guests hiding in the seaside luxury Marriott Hotel in
Panama City cheered when a battalion of elite U.S. airborne troops
shot their way through a neighborhood to reach the building late
Wednesday night, ending a day of terror.
   Cheney said the Pentagon had received conflicting reports about
American hostages.
   ``It's sort of a floating crap game,'' he said. ``There may well
still be some Americans held, but at this point we haven't been
able to confirm specific identities or specific numbers.''
   Bush ``is pleased by the military precision and smoothness of
the operation,'' said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. He said Bush
would take a planned vacation in Texas next week.
   Cheney gave this situation report today:
   ``The organized resistance by the Panamanian forces has
virutally ended. What we still have, though, is a situation in
which there are a fairly large number of so-called Dignity
Battalion members that are loose in the streets, many of them armed.
   ``So it's still a somewhat chaotic situation. Our forces are
still involved in some cases in firefights. And it's not complete
yet, but we've made major progress.''
   In his speech, Bush extended official diplomatic recognition to
a new Panamanian government headed by Guillermo Endara, the
opposition candidate in last May's elections voided by Noriega _
and moved swiftly to bolster him.
   Ambassador Arthur Davis returned to Panama for the first time
since the elections. At a heavily guarded news conference on a
military base attended only by a poo of Washington-based reporters,
Davis said he was bringing an economic recovery plan for discussion
with Panama's new leaders.
   He made no promise of U.S. aid except to point out that $700
million in assets would be returned as a result of Bush's decision
to lift economic sanctions.
   Davis added that ``deep down'' he thought leaders of other
regional countries would be happy to have Noriega gone, despite
their stated opposition to U.S. military intervention.
   The United States defended its decision at the United Nations
and at the Organization of American States meeting in Washington.
   Vice President Dan Quayle spoke by telephone with Endara's vice
presidents, Billy Ford and Ricardo Arias Calderon, and
administration officials also said privately he might visit Panama
next month in a gesture that would dramatize administration support.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the bounty on
Noriega's head would come from an existing drug enforcement fund.
   The reward is coupled with an offer of $150 per weapon to
Noriega loyalists who surrender their firearms.
   The assault was the first time U.S. military force had been used
against a foreign government since the 1986 air raid on Libya and
the first full-fledged assault since the invasion of Grenada in
1983.
   It came after American forces sat by, inactive, on Oct. 3 when
dissident Panamanian officers attempted a coup and briefly held
Noriega _ an incident that subjected Bush to congressional
criticism for timidity and indecision.

   U.S. military officials say they
have concluded that most of the fighting between pro-Noriega forces
and American troops has subsided and that little real threat
remains.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, director of public affairs for the U.S.
Southern Command, said Wednesday evening that a lot of the sporadic
gunfire still being heard around the country is from roving bands
of Noriega loyalists, known as Dignity Battlations, who are ``just
getting their last licks in.''
   Early Wednesday morning, John Bushnell, the U.S. charge
d'affaires in Panama, briefed the pool after President Bush spoke
to the nation. He said it was the clear desire of the new
government to take contol.
   Bushnell said he had dinner Monday night with three officials
that U.S. authorities say were elected in May 7 balloting:
President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents Ricardo Arias
Calderon and Guillermo Ford. Noriega annulled the elections.
   After getting pledges of secrecy from the civilian leaders,
Bushnell said he outlined the scope of the U.S. military plans. He
said they wrote Bush a letter affirming their support for the U.S.
assistance.
   Asked why the Panamanian civilian leaders had changed their
minds about having U.S. rather than Panamanian forces oust Noriega,
Bushnell said there had been no snap conversion.
   ``I don't think it was overnight,'' he said. ``It was a matter
that the Panamanians weren't being very successful in doing it.''
   After the failed coup on Oct. 3, he said, ``there was a feeling
that, well, there weren't many more Panamanians left with guns that
might do it, so it was becoming a hopeless situation.''
   ``They never said it so many words, `we wish you would really
send the 82nd Airborne to do it,' but they clearly indicated their
frustration that if we didn't, the situation was just going to go
on and get worse,'' Bushnell said.
   The new leaders' main concern, he said, was that if Noriega were
shot, another Panamanian Defense Force colonel might take his place.
   Bushnell said he thinks ``it is certainly possible'' that
Noriega might run for the hills to hide out or possibly seek refuge
in Cuba or Nicaragua. But he said it was unlikely he would take to
the hills to form a guerrilla movement inside Panama because he
lacks sufficient popular support.
   Bushnell said calls were made to Panamanan Defense Force
representatives by both the new government leaders and military
officers. In some instances, he said, the military officers would
speak to whomever answered the telephone at PDF headquarters and
say in effect: ``This is suicide _ pack it in.''
   At least two mortar rounds hit the embassy Wednesday, U.S.
officials said. Bushnell said that although Noriega remained at
large, officials had expectations at the outset of the operation
that he could be seized.
   ``If he had been at one of the several places we took down, we
would have gotten him. But he wasn't,'' Bushness said.

   Airlines and the Postal Service
struggled to make up for lost time as Redoubt Volcano slackened a
week into its first eruptions in 23 years.
   Flights were added Wednesday to supplement those reinstated a
day earlier after airborne volcanic ash cut into the state's air
transportation lifeline.
   Alaska Airlines, the main interstate carrier serving Anchorage,
said it had erased a passenger backlog in Seattle and reduced the
number of standbys in Anchorage.
   International airlines continued to divert flights away from
Alaska's largest city because of concerns about engine-clogging ash
from the volcano 115 miles southwest of Anchorage.
   The Postal Service said mail could be back to normal by today. A
backlog was caused by the need to use slower, less ash-sensitive
propeller planes instead of jets.

   The United States has plenty of plutonium for
future use in nuclear weapons, and the Bush administration should
drop plans to spend $1 billion to expand supplies of the material,
a government advisory panel concludes.
   The conclusion published Wednesday by a special committee of the
National Research Council contradicts the administration's repeated
assertions to Congress that additional capacity to make
weapon-grade plutonium is vital to national security.
   The Energy Department, which owns the nation's defense nuclear
materials plants, issued a brief statement saying it had not fully
analyzed the document but would respond in detail within 30 days.
It said the report's recommendations ``appear to to fully
consistent with and supportive of'' actions already taken or
planned by the department.
   Former Energy Secretary John Herrington said during the Reagan
administration that the nation is ``awash in plutonium,'' but his
successor, James D. Watkins, had disavowed the statement. Watkins
contends that while current plutonium supplies are adequate, more
capacity will be needed in the coming decade.
   The research council said it saw no good reason either to
produce more virgin plutonium or to increase the capacity for
processing recycled plutonium from old weapons. It also challenged
Watkins' plan to build a $600 million plant in Idaho that would
convert reactor-grade plutonium to weapon-grade material.
   ``The Department of Energy should concentrate on making better
use of existing plutonium processing capacity as required and
postpone plans to construct additional capabilities,'' the report
said.
   Many private arms control groups have long advocated scaling
back plutonium operations.
   ``This is a certification by a semi-official body that you don't
need'' additional plutonium supplies, said David Albright, senior
staff scientist of the Federation of American Scientists.
   The report also criticized some aspects of the Energy
Department's overall management of the weapons complex, which
includes 17 major plants and laboratories in 12 states.
   On the subject of plutonium, the report noted that the United
States already has more than 20,000 nuclear weapons.
   ``The plutonium in these devices, plus that in the supply chain,
is obviously sufficient to supply a nuclear deterrent of the
existing size or even greater,'' it said.
   Official information on nuclear arms materials is classified.
   Watkins has advocated building a Special Isotope Separation
plant at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory near Idaho
Falls. It would use a new vaporizing technology to convert
reactor-grade plutonium now stored near Richland, Wash., into
plutonium suitable for use in nuclear weapons.
   The scientific panel cited several reasons for scrapping the
Idaho project.
   ``To our knowledge, no compelling need for this material has
been demonstrated,'' its report said.
   It also said the Idaho facility, if built, could complicate
international efforts to limit the spread of nuclear arms. The new
isotope separation technology could be obtained by other countries
to convert fuel used in civilian nuclear reactors into high-grade
plutonium needed to build nuclear bombs, it said.
   John Spratt, D-S.C., chairman of a special House committee on
defense nuclear facilities, said in a telephone interview that the
report's conclusion about plutonium supplies, combined with
congressional resistance to adding more capacity, make it ``very
unlikely that the Special Isotope Separation plant will be built.''
   The report also said the Energy Department should drop plans to
spend $400 million renovating a building at the Rocky Flats plant
near Denver that recycles scrap plutonium into weapons-grade
material.
   The research council is an arm of the National Academy of
Sciences, a congressionally chartered group that conducts special
research at the request of the government.

   A Swedish court today convicted Mohammed
Abu Talb, a Palestinian suspected in the bombing of Flight 103, of
terrorism charges in connection with a fatal 1985 attack on an
airline office.
   The 35-year-old Palestinian was sentenced to life in prison for
the July 1985 bombing of a Northwest Airline office in Copenhagen.
The attack killed one person and wounded more than 20.
   A co-defendent, Marten Imandi, also 35, was convicted of charges
in connection with the Copenhagen attack and was sentenced to life
in prison.
   In Sweden, life imprisonment usually means 20 years at most.
   The court found Imandi guilty of murder for placing the fatal
explosive and convicted Abu Talb as an acessory.
   The convictions were part of a series legal actions concluded
today against a terrorist ring involved in bombings of U.S.,
Israeli and Jewish targets in Copenhagen and Amsterdam in 1985.
   They were acquitted of another bombing in Stockholm in 1986.
   The court also sentenced Mahmoud Al Mougrabi, 24, to six years
in prison and his 23-year-old brother Moustafa to a one-year
sentence for their involvement in the 1985 attacks.
   By coincidence, the verdict fell on the first anniversary of the
bombing of Flight 103, the Pan Am Boeing 747 that went down in
Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Abu Talb is a suspect in
that bombing.
   Abu Talb's possible connection with the disaster surfaced when
it was established he had been in the Mediterranean island of Malta
two months before the explosion, when investigators believe the
bomb may have been prepared.
   Shreds from clothes wrapped around the bomb could match clothing
that Abu Talb brought back with him from Malta. Scottish police
seized 15 bags of clothing from his Uppsala home Nov. 27.
   Legal expers have said that if he was indicted for the Pan Am
explosion, he could be extradited to face trial in a foreign
country. He likely would be returned to Sweden to complete his
sentence, however.
   Abu Talb, who listed his birthplace as the Sabra refugee camp in
Beirut, Lebanon, is a former Egyptian army soldier who deserted to
join the Palestine Popular Struggle Front.
   Police have taken extra security precautions at airports around
Sweden this week in anticipation of a possible terror attack to
mark the Flight 103 anniversary. Experts warned that a guilty
verdict could heighten the risk.
   The 100-page decision by the court in Uppsala, 40 miles north of
Stockholm, was distributed at the courthouse without a hearing.
   Meanwhile, a Swedish newspaper reported today that further
evidence had been uncovered linking Abu Talb to the Pan Am
explosion over Lockerbie.
   The Dagens Nyheter newspaper said police found a 1988 calendar
with the date Dec. 21 circled, the day the plane was blasted by a
barometer-triggered explosive concealed in a radio-tape player
inside a suitcase.
   Scottish police tried to question Abu Talb on Tuesday, but he
refused to cooperate. The officers reportedly left Sweden, and were
due back after the holidays to continue their probe.
   Lord Fraser, Scotland's chief law officer, has said no
prosecutions were imminent in the case and no extraditions had been
requested. He was quoted in London last week as saying the United
States likely would claim jurisdiction and any trial would be held
there.

<HEAD>Father of Accuser Says His Son is a Liar and Thief</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The father of a former male prostitute who
accused the Rev. Bruce Ritter of misusing Covenant House money and
engaging in a sexual affair called his son an emotionally troubled
liar and a thief.
   ``And he has a pattern of intentionally hurting people who try
to help him, particularly people who've become a father figure to
him,'' Alton Kite said of his son, 25, who used the name Timothy
Warner when he made the allegations against the founder of Covenant
House, an acclaimed shelter for runaways.
   Kite said at a news conference Wednesday that his son's behavior
is caused by a diagnosed personality disorder and that he has
received psychiatric treatment.
   Kevin Lee Kite's charges of financial improprieties by the Roman
Catholic priest are being investigated by the district attorney's
office.
   Colleen Roche, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district
attorney's office, had no comment on the elder Kite's remarks.
   The younger Kite, using another alias, was taken in by Covenant
House in New Orleans early last year. He was moved to New York
after he said he feared associates involved in drug running and
prostitution would kill him.
   Earlier this month, Kevin Kite charged that he and Ritter began
a sexual affair shortly after he was given haven here. The former
prostitute said that in return for sex, Ritter put him in an
apartment, enrolled him in a college, bought him clothes, a TV set
and a computer and gave him spending money.
   Ritter and other Covenant House officials denied the sexual
allegations and any financial wrongdoing.
   Kite's father, a junior-college accounting teacher in a town
near Dallas, said he decided to speak out after Covenant House
officials told him about his son's charges against Ritter.
   ``Kevin has caused people great problems and hardship with his
dishonesty before,'' Alton Kite said. ``I would like to help
someone who has suffered because of him.''
   He said he has spent thousands of dollars and suffered
immeasurable heartache trying to compensate his son's victims,
which include friends and neighbors.
   ``We're still paying for it,'' Kite said. ``His mother and I are
both teachers. We have almost no resources left, financially or
emotionally.''
   Kite said he had not spoken to his son since January.
   James Harnett, executive director of Covenant House, said that
the younger Kite ``lied to us about his name, lied to us about his
age, about his hometown and about his life being in danger. We also
know he's a thief _ his father has confirmed that.''
   Covenant House, founded by Ritter in New York, manages 17
shelters with more than 2,000 beds in the United States, Toronto
and Latin America.

<TEXT>
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said
today that the days of Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu are
numbered and called for his replacement.
   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honest
reason to remain,'' Mitterrand said at a news conference during his
three-day visit to East Germany. ``I think that the days of this
regime, in a Europe in full movement, are numbered. But at what
price!''
   In his first condemnation of the bloody suppression of protests
in Romania, Mitterrand ruled out foreign intervention to topple
Ceausescu. He said ``the response has to come from Romania.''
   Mitterrand also met with East German political leaders today to
express the concerns of the West about the possibility of German
unification.
   His visit came as West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told West
German lawmakers that the Germanys plan to strengthen all economic
and political ties.
   But Kohl also tried to ease the concerns of European nations
worried about a united Germany, saying the growing closeness of the
two countries can only help the continent.
   Meanwhile, the West German government said East Germany would
open Berlin's Brandenburg Gate on Friday. The gate is a historic
portion of the Berlin Wall viewed by many as a symbol of German
unity.
   Kohl, East German Premier Hans Modrow, West Berlin Walter
Momper, and East Berlin Mayor Erhard Krack will participate in the
historic ceremonies, said government spokesman Hans Klein.
   The official East German news agency ADN said Mitterrand met
with Modrow and that the ``joint responsibility for balance in
Europe'' was the main topic.
   Mitterrand and Modrow also discussed the possibility of
expanding ties, while the East German premier expressed interest in
a trade and cooperation agreement with the European Economic
Community, ADN said.
   It added that Mitterrand had reacted ``positively'' to the idea
of closer East German ties to the EEC.
   But before leaving Paris on Wednesday, Mitterrand said: ``For
the whole of Europe, it would not be good _ indeed it would be very
dangerous _ to reopen the issue of the existing borders.''
   In an interview with East German television, he also said the
``two paths open for the Germans are the democratic path and the
peaceful path.''
   The possibility of reunification was raised after the
pro-democracy movement recently forced the Communist Party in East
Germany to oust its hard-line leaders, lift travel restrictions and
open the Berlin Wall.
   Mitterrand arrived Wednesday, a few hours after Kohl Germany
ended an emotionally charged visit to East Germany that brought out
thousands advocating reunification.
   During Mitterrand's visit, French and East German officials are
to sign several agreements, including a five-year project for
closer economic and technical cooperation.
   At a state dinner Wednesday hosted by East Germany's interim
president Manfred Gerlach, a non-Communist, Mitterrand paid tribute
to the East German pro-democracy movement and said the Germans
should determine their own future.
   But he stressed that ``no country may impose its political
system on another.'' He said closer German ties would result in the
context of a strengthened European Community and a general
overcoming of the continent's division. Mitterrand is representing
the 12-nation EC, whose rotating presidency France holds until Dec.
31.
   He is also the first head of state from the three western World
War II Allies to visit East Berlin.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain have
ultimate authority over Berlin, a result of the postwar occupation
of Hitler's defeated Third Reich.
   While relations between Kohl and Mitterrand are close, the
French leader's statements before his trip highlighted traditional
French wariness of a strong Germany at the heart of Europe.

   The whereabouts of a CBS News producer who was

   ``Our efforts to find him have not stopped and will not stop

   The ABC producer, Robert Campos, 31, was freed Wednesday, nearly
six hours after he was abducted. He told reporters he had been held
in a Panamanian army intelligence headquarters where he was
``threatened, constantly.''
   He and Meyersohn were among the journalists in Panama covering
Wednesday's U.S. military strike there against Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   They were in the lobby of the Marriott Hotel in Panama City on
Wednesday morning, discussing plans to send tape footage by
satellite, when a group of armed men took them away, an ABC
spokeswoman said.
   Meyersohn, 33, is a New York-based producer for the ``CBS

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department, citing ``changing
conditions'' in the Soviet Union, is giving high priority to
constructing a new U.S. Embassy in Moscow to replace the one to be
razed after years of indecision.
   The job could cost up to $500 million. Nicholas Salgo, a former
U.S. ambassador to Hungary, was assigned Wednesday to hold formal
negotiations with the Kremlin. In the meantime, the Soviets will
continue to be shut out of their new embassy in the Mt. Alto
section of Washington and relegated to an older mansion near the
White House.
   Ever since U.S. intelligence 10 years ago detected what was said
to be a network of sophisticated listening devices in the Moscow
embassy, U.S. officials have pondered what to do with the $95
million building.
   Finally, on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
notified key members of Congress the embassy will be torn down and
a new one constructed in its place.
   Baker, who sent Salgo and Ivan Selin, the undersecretary of
state for management, to Moscow on an inspection trip in April,
passed up the option of saving millions of dollars by demolishing
only floors believed to be infested with ``bugs'' and salvaging
others.
   He also rejected the option of constructing an annex for
top-secret business. That would have involved at least two
problems: finding the space and creating an assumption that whoever
entered the annex was involved in sensitive operations.
   ``The decision was taken after a careful review of the
alternatives for dealing with the bugged new building,'' the State
Department said in a press release Wednesday night.
   ``The review showed that, among the realistic alternatives, the
teardown-rebuild option offered the optimum combination of
security, space, cost and time required for rebuilding,'' the
statement added.
   The embassy was built under a 1972 agreement made by the Nixon
administration that allowed the Soviets to prefabricate off-site
the concrete slabs for the building. U.S. officials did not insist
on a right of inspection.
   The agreement also provided for a new Soviet embassy in the Mt.
Alto section of Washington, one of the highest points in the U.S.
capital. It was built, but the Soviets were kept from occupying it
while a decision on the Moscow embassy was pending.
   Critics of the arrangement said Americans gave away valuable
real estate that also put the Soviets in a good spot to monitor
communications through listening devices. The Soviets, however,
have not been able to occupy their new building until the problems
with the Moscow embassy are solved.
   ``Soviet occupancy of their new chancery building at Mt. Alto
remains linked to our occupancy of a new building in Moscow,'' the
statement said.
   It said there was progress in preliminary talks with Soviet
officials and added, ``We look forward to working with the Congress
and getting on with the project.''
   ``The changing conditions in the Soviet Union have made
resolution of this issue very high among our foreign policy
priorities,'' it said.
   In April, Salgo and Selin reported to Baker that building an
annex would be cheaper than the estimated $500 million cost of
building a new embassy.
   Former President Reagan last year advocated razing the building,
saying the United States had ``no choice.'' But he left a decision
to Bush.
   The State Department said it will ask Congress in the next
budget for $270 million for initial building costs. It also said
the United States will press claims against the Soviets to recover
damages for implanting eavesdropping devices in the building and
for shoddy workmanship.
   Meanwhile, a trade group headed by Dwayne O. Andreas, chairman
of Archer Daniels Midland Co., offered to buy the building for use
as business offices.
   Andreas is co-chairman of the U.S.-USSR Trade and Economic
Council, which promotes trade between the two superpowers. He made
the offer on behalf of a consortium of U.S. companies, which would
have used the building as a Moscow headquarters.
   Baker's decision surfaced first on Capitol Hill where it was
disclosed by the office of Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
   ``I am extremely pleased that the Bush administration has given
final approval to the total reconstruction of our bugged embassy
building in Moscow,'' Snowe's office said. ``Our goal now must be
to move quickly to build a secure facility.''

   Susan Atkins, the Charles Manson
``family'' member who fatally stabbed pregnant actress Sharon Tate
20 years ago, has been denied parole for the ninth time.
   Fellow Manson disciple Leslie Van Houten was scheduled for a
parole hearing this morning.
   The victim's mother argued Wednesday against Ms. Atkins' release.
   ``I don't understand why anyone would murder an innocent
pregnant woman,'' Doris Tate told the three-member parole board.
``The thing that goes continually through my mind is the lack of
compassion Susan had for Sharon.''
   In rejecting her bid for release, the state parole board noted
Ms. Atkins had a role in eight murders ``for the bizarre motive of
starting a race war.''
   Ms. Atkins, 41, is serving a life sentence for murders that
included the 1969 slayings of Miss Tate and of grocer Leno LaBianca
and his wife the following night. Ms. Atkins won't get another
parole hearing until 1992.
   Neither Manson nor anyone else directly involved in the Tate or
LaBianca murders has been granted parole.

<TEXT>
   Romania today condemned the U.S. invasion
of Panama as ``brutal aggression'' as its own security forces
reportedly shot to death several civilians protesting the hard-line
Communist regime.
   A commentary in the Communist Party daily Scinteia and all other
state-run media carried an article headlined, ``An inadmissible act
of outstanding international gravity _ the U.S. aggression against
the republic of Panana.''
   The commentary expressing the official view said Romania had
repeatedly called for ``renunciation of measures of force and
threat of force'' and for resolving interstate disputes ``by
peaceful means only.''
   ``All the much more reprehensible are the U.S. actions of brutal
aggression as they were taken against a small state which defends
its independence and freedom violated by a superpower,'' the
Romanian statement said.
   It added, ``It is the sacred right of each people to decide its
own way of life, its political regime, according to its aspirations
and traditions.''
   ``By stating its solidarity with the Panamanian people's fight
for the independence of its country, the Romanian people firmly
condemns the U.S. armed intervention ... and asks that an end be
put forever to the colonialist, imperialist policy of domination
and dictate, of interference in the home afairs of peoples,'' the
commentary said.
   The criticism came on the same day a wave of unrest hit the
Romanian capital, Bucharest. The Soviet news agency Tass and a
reporter for the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said security forces
fired on protesters in Bucharest today.
   The Yugoslav reporter said several people were killed and
wounded, and military tanks were reported rolling through the city.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said
today that a stuffed animal Christmas toy sold to nearly 2 million
people may present a hidden suffocation danger to young children.
   The warning involves the ``Velveteen Rabbit'' in a red Christmas
stocking sold from Target Stores in 23 states.
   ``There is a plastic bag around the lower portion of the rabbit
which may present a risk of suffocation to young children,'' the
agency said in a written statement.
   Consumers should remove and discard the bag immediately, the
commission said.
   The bag, which is not a part of the toy, is inside the stocking
and ``may not be immediately noticed before the toy is given to a
child,'' the commission said.
   The floppy-eared brown-and-white rabbits come in two sizes _
8-inch and 12-inch _ and the bag on the larger rabbit could easily
fit over the head of a small child, a commission staffer said.
   Approximately 1,750,000 of the toys, which meet all mandatory
and voluntary packaging and toy safety standards, have been sold.
   The toy rabbits were sold in Missouri, Minnesota, Illinois,
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, Iowa, Oklahoma, Texas, Nevada, North
Dakota, South Dakota, Colorado, Montana, Wyoming, Washington,
California, Arizona, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas, Florida and
North Carolina.
   Consumers may contact Target Stores at 612-370-6000.

   East Germany recalled its ambassador and
Czechoslovakia issued a formal protest as European nations formed a
united front today to condemn the bloody repression of protesters
in Romania.
   The international outcry came after reports that security forces
for the second time in a week fired on crowds of protesters in
Romania, and that shooting also occurred in the western Romanian
city of Arad.
   East Germany, where the hard-line government was toppled by
reformers in October, condemned what it called the ``brutal action
of the Romanian state power against peaceful citizens demonstrating
to assert their elementary human rights.''
   In a statement, the government called on Romania to halt
immediately all violence against its people. East German Ambassador
Herbert Plaschke was recalled from Romania for consultations in
East Berlin.
   Czechoslovakia also summoned a senior Romanian diplomat to
receive a protest from the Foreign Ministry in Prague.
   Massive protests in Czechoslovakia and East Germany in recent
months have toppled the old hard-line regimes in those nations and
ushered in new eras of breathtaking reforms.
   But the regime of Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu has tried
to crush the protests with bloodshed, according to reports reaching
the West. Last weekend, security forces fired on protesters in the
western city of Timisoara.
   Government protests against the Ceausescu regime continued in
Hungary, which has long had tense relations with Bucharest because
of alleged harassment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in
Romania.
   ``There exists or has developed in Romania a serious political
movement,'' said Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn. ``I do not
know exactly wheter it is comprehensive. It is an anti-Ceausescu
movement.
   ``There is no accurate information on its strength, on the
extent to which it has spread,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union officially reacted with caution, but the
state-run Tass news agency stepped up coverage of the Romanian
events, giving vivid accounts of violence against demonstrators by
the government.
   ``If we do receive information on victims among people we, of
course, will be extremely sorry for them,'' said Soviet Foreign
Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev.
   ``We should emphasize that we do have opinions on what is
happening, but in my place as an official representative of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I cannot go into comments without
having all-inclusive information and orders in that regard.''
   In East Berlin, French President Francois Mitterrand was far
more blunt.
   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honest
reason to remain,'' he told reporters. ``I think that the days of
this regime, in a Europe in full movement, are numbered. But at
what price?''
   Ruling out foreign intervention, Mitterrand said, ``the response
has to come from Romania.''
   In Bonn, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman Hans Klein
said Kohl was ``deeply shocked over the brutal repression of the
justified and peaceful protests of the (Romanian) people.''
   ``He strongly condemns the massive use of weapons and the
reprehensible attempts by the Romanian leadership to suppress the
efforts for freedom and democracy,'' Klein said, quoting Kohl.
   Klein said Kohl ``appeals to those responsible at all levels in
Romania to halt repression by the military and security police, and
to open a dialogue on the justified demands of people.''
   In London, the Foreign Office said Common Market countries were
considering a withdrawal of ambassadors from Romania in the wake of
the weekend massacre of civilians during anti-government
demonstrations.
   But the spokesman stressed that this was only one of a number of
options under consideration by the 12 member states as a response
to the crackdown.
   Meanwhile, Italy announced it has recalled its ambassador to
Romania, Luigi Amaduzzi, for consultations.
   The Greek government also condemned the suppression of the
Romanian protests, and all political parties also expressed outrage.
   The Athens Academy of Sciences stripped Ceausescu's wife, Elena,
of her membership, awarded in 1976.
   In Austria, President Kurt Waldheim expressed his ``deep
concern'' over bloody repression of the ``peace movement'' in
Romania.
   He spoke of a ``serious violation of human rights.''
   ``The Communist regime in Romania is very brutal, and the
Western countries, whose unity in this matter could be greater''
should use all possibilities in order to help set afoot reforms in
Romania, Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock said.
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek Wednesday on summoned
Romanian Ambassador Constantin Statescu and told him of the Hague
government's ``grave concern about the repression of defenseless
demonstrators.''
   Van den Broek also appealed to the Ceausescu government ``not to
turn a dead ear to the population's call for change'' and
threatened ``further measures'' in line with the other 11 nations
of the European Community.

   The Justice Department set up a hot line today
to collect tips from callers who may have information on the
whereabouts of deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The Bush administration is offering a $1 million reward for
information leading to the capture of Noriega, who is wanted by
federal authorities on drug trafficking charges.
   The line was set up after the White House and the Justice
Department received calls from people offering information about
Noriega, who has been missing since U.S. forces invaded Panama
early Tuesday, said department spokesman David Runkel.
   Information taken from people who call the number will be
forwarded to U.S. officials in Panama. The U.S. Embassy in Panama
City is collecting tips from Panamanians, Runkel said.
   Runkel cited a number of calls already received when asked if he
thought the Justice Department realistically expected to get useful
information about Noriega from people in this country.
   The spokesman said he couldn't say whether the tips in hand
contained specific, credible or even useful information.
   One of the stated purposes of the invasion was to capture
Noriega, but he has so far eluded capture.
   The hot line number is 202-633-1000.

<TEXT>
   Elvis Presley's $100 million estate has
been turned over to his daughter and sole heir after more than a
decade of legal disputes, including a woman's claim to be The
King's illegitimate daughter.
   The estate will continue to be managed for Presley's daughter,
Lisa Marie, by a trust until 1998.
   Retired Probate Judge Joseph Evans returned to the bench briefly
Wednesday to sign the final order, which had been held up by a
young woman's claim as Presley's illegitimate daughter.
   Evans denied the claim in 1988 on grounds of insufficient
evidence, and appeals courts upheld the decision.
   Presley, ``the king of rock 'n' roll,'' died at his Graceland
mansion in Memphis in 1977. His estate has been managed in trust
for Miss Presley, who turns 22 in February.
   Miss Presley would have taken sole control of the estate at 25,
according to her father's will, but last year she agreed to extend
the trust until 1998. Miss Presley's mother, Priscilla Presley, was
divorced from her father when he died.
   The estate was valued at $5 million to $7 million at Presley's
death. The trust opened Presley's mansion to tourists in 1982, and
the estate also draws royalties from his recordings and controls
use of his name and image.

   The Grinches who stole Victor Diaz's van were
too busy guzzling two six-packs of beer he left on a front seat to
notice a load of Christmas toys in the back worth more than $500.
   ``My jaws dropped when I saw the toys in there,'' Diaz said
Wednesday. ``Every hair on my body went up. The officer said, `This
never happens.'''
   He had worried his family's Christmas was ruined after the van
was stolen from their driveway Monday night.
   But the only things missing when he found the van in suburban
Pacoima the next day were 12 beers, a set of wrenches, a small
stool-like table and pink bunny purse belonging to Diaz's daughter.
   Diaz had spent two hours at a toy store Monday night, buying
gifts for his four children, ages 3 to 12. He said he spent $564.
He planned to hide the toys in the garage after the childre were
asleep.
   But when he went out around 11 p.m., the van was gone.

   Two weeks of pounding rains in
northern Brazil have killed 32 people and left thousands homeless,
civil defense officials said Thursday.
   Worst hit was the state of Bahia, where 24 people died and
25,000 were left homeless, according to the Rio daily newspaper
Jornal do Brasil.
   Gloria Pires da Silva, a civil defense official in the city of
Santa Barbara, said 18 people died after six cars fell into a
30-foot hole that opened up after a road crumbled.
   Five others drowned when rivers flooded, and a man in the town
of Feira de Santana died of a heart attack when he woke up and
discovered several feet of water in his home, Jornal do Brasil
reported.
   In the neighboring state of Minas Gerais, eight people died and
15,000 people were homeless, said state official Capt. Geraldo
Teixeira. Seven of the eight drowned in the colonial city of Ouro
Preto when waters swept a shantytown.
   Heavy rains fell throughout northern Brazil and hundreds have
been left homeless in the rural states of Piaui, Maranhao, Goias
and Tocantins.

   A new charity to aid Third World countries was
launched Thursday in memory of the United Nations Commissioner for
Namibia who was killed in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing.
   The Bernt Carlsson Trust, named after the commissioner, was
launched on the first anniversary of the bombing. Carlsson, a
Swede, had been on his way to New York to sign a Namibian peace
settlement and was one of the 270 victims.
   Glenys Kinnock, wife of opposition Labor Party leader Neil
Kinnock, said the charity would funds for Namibia, formerly South
African-controlled South-West Africa.
   ``Our aims are to have some memorial to Bernt Carlsson who spent
his life, dedicating his life to relieving poverty in the
developing world,'' said Mrs. Kinnock, who is heading the trust.
   Carlsson's brother, Tore, attended the launch of the charity.
   The trustees include rock star Peter Townsend of The Who.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister V.P. Singh's minority
government passed its first test of support Thursday, winning a
vote of confidence in Parliament as expected.
   A chorus of ``Yes!'' arose when the vote was called and Speaker
Rabi Ray of Singh's People's Party declared the motion carried. The
Congress Party of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi abstained.
   Singh, who led a broad coalition in the November elections,
presented the confidence motion. He had pledges of support from
several parties that would have given him more half the votes if a
roll- call vote had been necessary.
   He took office Dec. 2, ending Gandhi's five-year tenure as prime
minister, and named his Cabinet three days later. Under a deadline
set by President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, he had until Jan. 1 to
obtain approval from the legislators.
   Shortly before the vote was taken, Singh told Parliament his
government showed India could turn from personalities to issues in
choosing a leader.
   ``The delicate balance of political forces may turn out to be
the most glorious occasion for our democracy,'' said the new prime
minister, whose victory ended a hold on power by the Congress Party
that extended back through Gandhi's mother, Indira, to his
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru.
   It is only the second time since independence from Britain in
1947 that the Congress Party has not controlled the government.
   This also was the first time a prime minister or his party had
initiated a confidence motion.
   The constitution does not require a confidence vote for a new
government, but neither does it prohibit one. President
Venkataraman felt a vote was the best way to determine whether
Singh's government could function.
   In the elections, Gandhi's Congress Party won 193 of the 525
seats in the lower house of Parliament, making it the largest
single party. The People's Party won 137 seats and its partners in
the National Front alliance won three.
   Venkataraman asked Singh, 58, to form a government after he had
obtained pledges of support from a Hindu nationalist party, with 86
seats, and a leftist alliance with 52.

   Doctors and nurses at San Antonio military
hospitals postponed holiday leaves and worked extra shifts today
treating more than 190 soldiers hurt in Panama, the biggest influx
of casualties here since Vietnam, officials said.
   Two C-141 transport planes carrying 85 soldiers arrived today at
Kelly Air Force Base; two planes on brought 108 to Kelly on
Wednesday, hospital spokesmen said. Four of the soldiers died en
route here or after arrival.
   The Pentagon today reported 19 dead, one missing and 117
wounded; there was no immediate explanation of the discrepancy in
the number hurt.
   Kelly officials were told their base would receive all the
soldiers injured in the fighting in Panama.
   The wounded were taken by ambulance, bus and helicopter from
Kelly to 1,000-bed Wilford Hall Medical Center at adjacent Lackland
Air Force Base and to Brooke Army Medical Center, the military's
leading burn unit.
   ``The biggest and the most extensive injuries are gunshot-type
wounds, schrapnel-type wounds, leg wounds, broken bones, this sort
of thing,'' said Lackland spokesman Lt. Col. Johnny Whitaker.
   Whitaker said it is the largest surge of injured at the San
Antonio hospitals since the Vietnam War.
   He said the military would not release the names of the dead or
injured until family members were notified. However, Whitaker said
patients range in condition from fair to critical.
   Doctors and nurses were called in on extra shifts and some
holiday leaves were delayed, he said.
   More than 200 military doctors and 500 nurses are stationed at
Wilford Hall. The hospital, the Air Force's largest, also treated
victims of the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the bombing of the
Marine headquarters in Lebanon in 1983.
   Motels near Wilford Hall were offering complimentary rooms for
relatives of wounded soldiers, Whitaker said.
   Reporters were kept outside a Lackland gate about a half-mile
from the hospital, but ambulances could be seen shuttling between
Wilford Hall and the Kelly tarmac.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration today accused the
government of Romania of ``brutal repression'' in opening fire on
anti-government protesters in the capital of Bucharest and in the
city of Timisoara.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater also dismissed any
suggestions of a parallel between the bloody crackdown and on the
U.S. military invasion of Panama on Wednesday.
   Romania, a hardline Soviet ally, condemned the United States for
``brutal aggression'' in Panama. But Fitzwater insisted that the
United States was reinforcing the will of the Panamanian people
with its military action.
   At his daily news briefing, Fitzwater was asked why Panama was
different.
   ``They had an election there that registered the people's
wishes'' to be rid of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ``by a
three-to-one margin,'' he replied.
   Of Romania, Fitzwater said: ``We understand the demonstrations
there are continuing. We are monitoring the situation.''
   He called on the Romanian government to ``cease its brutal
repression of these demostrators, open its borders and respect the
Helsinki commitments'' to human rights.
   ``A state of emergency exists in western Romania,'' Fitzwater
said.
   ``We do maintain there was a bloody massacre'' in the city of
Timisoara, where soldiers and police reportedly fired on hundreds
and perhaps thousands of people. ``We assume there are considerable
numers of people wounded and injured in these demonstrations,''
Fitzwater said.

   About 10,000 Islamic fundamentalists
massed outside the National Assembly on Thursday to demonstrate for
the ``dignity of Islamic women.''
   The rally, attended by many women with their heads covered by
the traditional scarf, was intended as a reply to a recent
spontaneous demonstration of women at the site to protest Islamic
extremism and demand the strict application of Algeria's
Constitution calling for equality of the sexes.
   Loudspeakers broadcast verses from the Koran, the Moslem holy
book, without interruption, while orderlies arranged the lines of
demonstrators before the National Assembly as the police looked on
but took no action.
   Meanwhile, the National Assembly adopted a ban on political
demonstrtations at sites reserved for religious purposes.
   The fundamentalists who control most of the 8,000 Algerian
mosques have increasingly used their sermons to denounce the
``Westernization'' of Algerian society and the decline of strict
Islamic values.

   The arrival of winter today brought another punishing blast of
arctic air, dropping temperatures well below zero from Wyoming to
Michigan, giving shivers to the Deep South and stopping a passenger
train in North Dakota.
   Forecasters said the polar winds blamed in at least 42 deaths
around the country in the past week may stop by Christmas. But the
cold had much of the nation well prepared for the 4:22 p.m. EST
start of winter.
   ``I doubt we'll notice it,'' said Terry Conroy, a street cleaner
in Syracuse, N.Y., where crews have had to remove snow almost daily
in the past few weeks.
   The National Weather Service's Albany, N.Y., bureau described
the weather as ``cold, with a double underline on that.'' In
Chicago, where a minus 13 reading this morning broke a minus 12
record for the date set in 1872, the weather service warned
travelers to ``dress for arctic cold.''
   It was so cold in Minot, N.D., that the fuel froze in an engine
of a train bound for Chicago from Seattle, stranding about 300
passengers and crew overnight, said Mike Kirka, an Amtrak ticket
agent in Chicago.
   The temperature was about 30 below, with the wind chill near
minus 80, when the train pulled into the Minot station shortly
before midnight, Kirka said. The engine wouldn't restart, and after
three hours passengers were put up at hotels at Amtrak's expense,
he said.
   In addition to the 42 cold-related deaths, authorities in
Philadelphia were investigating the deaths of a homeless man who
was found Wednesday on an outdoor vent wrapped in blankets and two
elderly people who died in a home with no heat.
   Wind chills were expected today to be as low as 80 below in
North Dakota, 75 below in Minnesota and 65 below in Missouri.
People were urged to stay indoors, and some schools were closed
today in North Dakota and Nebraska.
   Today's low temperature in the Lower 48 states was minus 43 at
Jordan, Mont.
   Other early morning temperatures included minus 28 in Bismarck,
N.D.; minus 22 in Minneapolis-St. Paul; 17 below in Des Moines,
Iowa; minus 20 in Omaha, Neb.; minus 12 in Rapid City, S.D.; 16
below in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., and minus 9 in Casper, Wyo.
   Little Rock, Ark., was a chilly 20, while Fort Worth, Texas, was
24.
   But today's surge of arctic air into northern Minnesota appeared
to be the last in the series of blasts that have crossed the border
into Minnesota and plagued the eastern half of the nation for 10
days, the weather service said.
   ``The trend looks hopeful for a change in the cold northwest
flow to a more westerly flow on the weekend over Minnesota,'' the
weather service said. ``This means a very slow moderation in
temperatures by Sunday and Christmas Day.''
   On the last day of fall, gusty winds dropped the wind chill to
81 below zero at Minot, N.D., 75 below at Devils Lake, N.D., 69
below at Alexandria, Minn., and Jamestown, N.D., and 61 below at
Aberdeen, S.D.
   The southern edge of the cold air on Wednesday extended from New
York state across Ohio, Indiana, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, Colorado,
Wyoming and central Montana.
   By today, the cold dipped to northern Texas and northern
Louisiana. The temperature in Amarillo, Texas, dropped to 1 degree
overnight. By Friday, the arctic was expected to invade North
Carolina and northern Georgia.
   The weather service forecast a ``major freeze'' across the lower
Rio Grande Valley of Texas from tonight into Saturday.
   In the Midwest, many authorities warned people to take
precautions against the cold. Sheriff Stan Lyson of Williams
County, N.D., urged residents to stay home unless travel was
absolutely necessary.
   He suggested Christmas travelers inform someone of their
destination and the route they plan to take. ``I don't think anyone
would last out there very long,'' Lyson said.
   Temperatures hovered around 10 degrees Wednesday in Rochester,
N.Y., but the wind made it feel like 25 below zero. ``The place is
packed with people drinking hot toddies at the bar,'' said Mary
Camp, bookkeeper at the Sea Breeze Inn.
   The weather service's official low temperature for the Lower 48
states Wednesday was 34 below zero at International Falls and
Warroad, Minn., both on the Canadian border. Embarrass, an Iron
Range town in northeastern Minnesota, reached an unofficial 37
below zero.
   Wednesday's high at International Falls was only 21 degrees
below zero.
   In the southern Chicago suburb of Harvey, the bitter cold burst
a 24-inch water main, cutting service to six communities.
   Between 2,000 and 3,000 motorists called for help starting their
cars, the Automobile Association of America-Chicago Motor Club said.
   Snow fell from the northern Rockies across the northern Plains
and around the Great Lakes, where ``lake effect'' snow fed by the
moisture of the lakes piled up 4-foot drifts in western New York
state.
   The weather service at Syracuse had measured 50.4 inches of snow
for the fall. At this time last year, only 27.2 inches of snow had
fallen.
   Unusually low temperatures this month have strained utilities
throughout New York and New England, and could bring brownouts in
some areas as winter progresses, officials said.
   Temperatures 10 degrees lower than normal for this time of year
have forced New York, New England and the Maryland-Pensylvannia-New
Jersey power pools to share electricity.

   U.S. forces swept into Panama City today on
the second day of a massive military strike, encountering ``some
shooting'' by troops loyal to Manuel Antonio Noriega and searching
for Americans being held against their will, the Pentagon said.
   Rear Adm. Ted Scheafer told reporters ``organized resistance had
pretty much been taken care of.'' He acknowledged sporadic
fighting, saying ``people on the tops of buildings are the kind of
thing I'm talking about.''
   Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams said there had been
``some sightings'' reported of Noriega, but he remained at large
despite a massive military operation involving more than 20,000
U.S. forces.
   Officials said they believed the dictator remained in Panama,
despite reports that placed him in three different countries _
Colombia, Mexico and the Dominican Republic.
   Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said there was a possibility Noriega and
some loyal troops had sought refuge in the jungles, and said ``when
it comes time we'll do what's necessary'' to find him.
   Williams said the latest U.S. casualty count stood at 19 killed
in action, 117 wounded and one missing. He said the first American
dead were being flown back to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware
later in the day.
   Officials at military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, said they
were treating about 190 wounded troops evacuated from Panama, a
higher count than that reported at the Pentagon.
   Williams said American troops had taken roughly 1,500 prisoners
in the first 36 hours of armed combat.
   Williams said there were three reports of Americans being held
against their will, and added, ``We take them all seriously.'' He
said they included a group of Smithsonian Institution scientists
and John Myerson, a CBS News television producer.
   Officials said American troops evacuated 29 Americans and 35
foreign nationals, mostly Panamanians, from the Marriott Hotel in
Panama City late Wednesday night.
   Williams said U.S. troops had discovered a large cache of
documents in a military headquarters building, and they would be
studied for possible use in any trial against Noriega, who is under
indictment in the United States on drug charges.
   The spokesman put the casualty count for Panamanian Defense
Forces as 59 killed, 66 wounded and more than 1,500 taken prisoner.
   Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
outlined three goals for the day's military operation: continued
support for the operations of the new government, to secure Panama
City and to ``continue to track Mr. Noriega in an effort to capture
him.''
   He said U.S. forces had secured the legislative building, and he
raised the possibility that Guillermo Endara, the new U.S.-backed
president, would go there during the day.
   The formal briefing came several hours after Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney called the deaths of American servicemen ``a terrible
tragedy,'' but said the number of casualties was low given the
complexity of the operation.
   As for Noriega, who now as a $1 million U.S. bounty on his head,
Cheney said, ``We're getting phone calls coming in from Panamanians
who have suspicions, thoughts or ideas'' about where Noriega may be
hiding.
   ``We will chase down the individual reports, but we do not know
where he is,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.
   In television interviews, Powell and Cheney said it was unclear
how many Americans were being detained or held hostage in Panama.
   ``You can be sure, however, that this is a primary concern for
us today,'' Powell said on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.'' ``We
will do everything we can to determine who is unaccounted for and
do everything we can to locate those individuals.''
   Reinforcements were sent in late Wednesday from Fort Ord,
Calif., and Fort Bragg, N.C., to bolster the U.S. troops
participating in ``Operation Just Cause'' to about 24,000 men.
   Cheney said he hoped some of the troops would be called home by
Christmas, but Powell and other Pentagon officials said it was
unclear when the United States would be withdraw all of the troops
sent in to bolster those already stationed at the Panama Canal.
   The U.S. attack force planned to make sure Panama City's streets
were clear of Noriega loyalists today, Kelly said, adding that most
Panamanian units had dispersed and may have fled into the jungle.
   ``There is every chance that we will go off after them,'' he
added.
   Kelly and Sheafer, also on the staff of the Joint Chiefs, said
Wednesday there were difficult tasks ahead, even though the
Panamanian Defense Forces were largely subdued.
   ``We went after them first. We have reduced them,'' Kelly said.
``That's a problem we're having in a lot of areas in that much of
the PDF is fleeing in the face of the U.S. military units.''
   The Americans' next priority was to ferret out 18 so-called
Dignity Battalions, armed gangs primarily roaming the streets of
Panama City, a metropolis of about 1 million people, officials said.
   The battalions ``vary in size from as few as a couple of dozen
people to about 250,'' said Sheafer. ``They are throughout many
parts of Panama City at this time.''
   The move into the city is designed in part to protect Americans
and others, Kelly said.
   ``Urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind,'' he
said. ``To sweep through, it's going to take a lot of people.''
   Kelly said the Americans, some of whom had been up for three
days traveling and fighting, were exhausted.
   About 7,000 troops, including Army Rangers, Marines,
paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, special units and
military police, were flown into Panama Tuesday evening for the 1
a.m. pre-dawn start-up on Wednesday.
   They joined about 13,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama with
the primary mission of protecting the Panama Canal. The canal was
open Wednesday with no threat from the Panamanians, Kelly said.
   U.S. troops relied on heavy equipment in their efforts to rout
the PDF. Four light tanks, called Sheridans, were brought to Panama
earlier, Kelly said. The military also used six Apache helicopters
and some Air Force AC-130 gunships.

   As grieving relatives watched,
clergymen today dedicated a granite memorial etched with the names
of 270 people killed when their plane blew up over this once
obscure Scottish town.
   The somber dedication under leaden skies marked the first
anniversary of the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Two light aircraft trailing smoke to form a cross flew overhead
during the simple ceremony in a 19th century graveyard attended by
500 people, including at least 20 American relatives of victims.
   ``This is a family occasion,'' the local member of Parliament,
Sir Hector Monro, said before the group joined in singing ``The
Lord Is My Shepherd'' at the end of the 10-minute ceremony.
   Names of the victims are carved in roughly alphabetical order _
family members are grouped together _ in the light polished granite
of the 6-foot memorial consisting of three panels.
   As darkness fell, an American couple, Paul and Eleanor Hudson,
whose 16-year-old daughter, Melina, was killed, lit 270 luminarias
_ candles in sand-filled bags _ along a path leading to the
memorial and in a circle before it.
   ``It's the greatest honor I can think of,'' said Mrs. Hudson,
from Albany, N.Y. The luminarias were made by students at Melina's
school, the Albany Academy for Girls.
   Wreaths heaped at the foot of the memorial included one from
Syracuse University in New York, dedicated to its 25 students who
died on Flight 103 as they flew home for Christmas from an exchange
program.
   Relatives stood with heads bowed during the dedication.
Drizzling rain stopped as the service began in the Dryfesdale
Cemetery, one mile outside Lockerbie.
   No formal invitations were issued, but the U.S. ambassador,
Henry Catto, attended and Queen Elizabeth II sent a representative.
   Later today, American relatives were attending another service
at an isolated stone church outside the village near where the nose
cone crashed. To end the somber and poignant day, an ecumenical
service was being held in front of the Town Hall which a year ago
was turned into a makeshift morgue.
   ``I thought it was very appropriate and very respectful ... an
extension of the people of Lockerbie. They've given us faith and
hope throughout the year,'' said Joe Horgan of Philadelphia, a
member of the board of Victims of Pan Am flight 103. It represents
American victims.
   Horgan's brother-in-law, Michael Doyle, was on the flight.
   George Williams, 58, a real estate agent from Joppa, Md., said:
``While this might be a traumatic experience for us, the worst has
already happened.''
   Scottish investigators say the bomb that brought down Flight 103
was made of powerful plastic explosives concealed in a
radio-cassette player.
   Police heading the international manhunt for the bombers have
confirmed that one focus of their investigation is the Popular
Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, Ahmed
Jibril's radical Syria-based faction.
   Jibril has denied involvement, but acknowledged his group has
used devices similar to the bomb that blew the jumbo jet apart.

   The Panama Canal reopened Thursday
after a one-day closing caused by the U.S. invasion, the only time
anything other than natural disaster has halted operation of the
75-year-old waterway.
   The Panama Canal Commission said the canal will operate only
during the daytime until at least this weekend.
   Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon said only an average of
12 ships daily will travel the waterway, compared with a normal
average of about 33 a day when the canal operates its regular
round-the-clock schedule.
   The 43-mile canal had been closed since 1 a.m. Wednesday ``due
to the concern for the safety of vessels and of canal employees
during U.S. military activities in the area,'' the commission said
in a statement from the Washington office of the canal secretary,
Michael Rhode Jr.
   The commission said there has been no damage to canal facilities.

   A 52-pound turkey once bound for a
Christmas banquet table is pecking away in a back yard because an
animal control officer didn't have the heart to wring its neck.
   The turkey was found waddling the streets this week and senior
animal control Officer John Gonzales initially hoped to donate it
to a group that feeds the homeless.
   ``Everyone was interested in getting a turkey that large, but no
one wanted him alive,'' he said. But no one wanted to kill the
bird, especially not Gonzales.
   So he turned to Beach Charities, a non-profit group that
sponsors a Christmas Adopt-a-Pet program.
   Sharrie Dyer, director of Beach Charities, said she liked the
idea of donating a big turkey to feed the homeless. But she hated
the idea of playing benefactor and butcher.
   ``After all,'' she said, ``our mascot is a 7-foot pelican, Long
Beak. How would it look for Long Beak to kill a turkey?''
   So she bought 20 lifeless turkeys for the Christmas dinners of
needy families.
   And animal control Officers Donna and Paul Clement adopted the
gobbler and added him to their menagerie on their ranch near Corona.
   His name?
   ``Lotto, of course,'' said Gonzales. ``Because he's so lucky to
be alive.''

   As the Security Council convened for an
emergency debate on the U.S. invasion of Panama, the question that
immediately arose was: who speaks for Panama?
   The council was expected to recognize a new Panamanian
ambassador today, said diplomats and U.N. officials speaking
privately.
   At issue was which government was legitimate: that of strongman
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega or Guillermo Endara's, which was
installed by the U.S. troops that invaded Panama early Wednesday
and smashed Noriega's forces.
   The United States, with help from other Western members, pressed
Wednesday for recognition of a new ambassador appointed by Endara's
government.
   Diplomats said Endara had appointed Eduardo Vallarino, a
Panamanian businessman in self-imposed exile in the United States.
   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said today the
council was faced with an unprecedented situation because the
upheaval occurred when Panama had no accredited U.N. ambassador to
argue a case.
   The previous permanent representative, Leonardo Kam, was
promoted to foreign minister, and no one took his place.
   Noriega's government is trying to have its ambassador to the
European Community, Mirla Bellavita, accredited as U.N. ambassador.
   Perez de Cuellar said of the U.S. invasion that ``the position
of the United Nations for the last 45 years is that we always
regret the use of force.''
   ``At the same time, I think I shouldn't forget to say that what
is important as well for the United Nations is the preservation of
democracy,'' he added.
   Endara won the presidency in Panama's national elections May
7-9. But the Noriega-controlled government nullified the results
before they were announced.
   During Wednesday's debate, U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering
said his country had exercised its right to self-defense under
international law and the U.N. Charter ``in response to armed
attacks by forces under the direction of Manuel Noriega.''
   Panamanian soldiers shot and killed a U.S. Marine officer at a
roadblock Saturday night, one day after Noriega declared ``a state
of war'' existed between his country and the United States.
   American officials said the Marine, a lieutenant, was unarmed
and that the attack on him and three fellow Americans was
unprovoked.
   Pickering said the incident capped two years of harassment of
U.S. military personnel and workers at the Panama Canal Commission.
He said more than 400 U.S. personnel had been detained and 140
endangered.
   Pickering noted that Noriega's 1988 indictment in the United
States on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges.
   ``Gen. Noriega could not be permitted falsely to wrap himself in
the flag of Panamanian sovereignty while the (Colombian) drug
cartels with which he is allied intervene throughout this
hemisphere,'' the ambassador said.
   ``That is aggression. It is aggression against us all, and now
it is being brought to an end,'' Pickering said.
   ``His ruthless cabal repeatedly obstructed the will of the
Panamanian people which has been expressed in (the May) free
elections,'' which Noriega's candidate lost, Pickering said.
   The ambassadors of Nicaragua, China and the Soviet Union
criticized the invasion and said U.S. troops should be withdrawn
immediately.
   Britain and Canada's ambassadors defended the intervention,
saying Noriega had provoked it.
   Ambassador Pierre-Louis Blanc of France agreed that the United
States had been provoked, but said, ``For us, use of outside force
is deplorable, whatever the circumstances.''
   Panama has repeatedly come before the council to complain about
allegedly provocative U.S. military maneuvers it said were intended
to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple Noriega.
   During council debates in April and August, Panama claimed the
United States was trying to provoke confrontations in order to keep
control of the Panama Canal.
   Under 1977 treaties, the United States will cede control of the
canal to Panama at the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Panama Strike Example of Army's Hoped-For Future Role</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's nighttime airlift of
thousands of soldiers to a battle zone in Panama was a
here-and-now, guns and planes example of what some Pentagon
planners see as ``the Army of the future.''
   With the Pentagon facing likely budget restraints in the coming
years _ and with a declining Soviet threat suggesting deep troop
reductions in Europe _ senior Army planners have proposed that
their service be molded into a lighter, more flexible fighting
force that can be ordered to hot spots within hours.
   Since the Panamanian strike came as Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney was hammering out the Pentagon's five-year budget
projections, some senior Army officials indicated that the timing
couldn't hurt their cause.
   ``We made a decision, and in almost no time at all we were
putting our paratroopers and our Rangers on airplanes and sending
them down there,'' Army Gen. Tom W. Kelly, the director of
operations for the Pentagon's Joint Staff, told reporters on
Wednesday.
   ``I don't know that there's another country in the world that
can do that,'' Kelly said.
   There were some advantages in the Panama situation that wouldn't
necessarily be present in many foreign battle scenes. The Army was
able to do months of on-the-scene planning in Panama and link up
with an established fighting force of some 13,000 soldiers, sailors
and helicopter gunship pilots already based there.
   As well, commanders could count on cooperation from the Air
Force, Navy and Marines. The Army would like to plan on that in the
future, but the past has shown that service rivalries can make for
messy military operations.
   Some of the ideas for revamping the Army were first put forward
this year by the Army chief of staff, Gen. Carl Vuono. That was in
a ``white paper'' that envisioned a pared-down force that would
rely more on air assault, light infantry and mechanized units _ the
very mix that was used in the Panamanian operation.
   ``The Army of the future is one that is versatile ... an Army
that can be forward deployed ... albeit at smaller numbers, an Army
that has a contingency package that can go worldwide, an Army that
has a mix of heavy, light and special operations forces,'' Vuono
told reporters in October.
   Army plans envision slashing the current 764,000-strong force to
630,000 by 1994, Army sources have said.
   Gen. Gordon R. Sullivan, the Army's deputy chief of staff for
operations and plans, predicted in an interview last week that by
1995-96, ``you'll see more (of the nation's forces) in the
continental U.S.,'' but that those soldiers will be ``capable of
responding to any contingency.''
   Sullivan added that while the Army is preparing for the future,
its leaders are determined not to repeat what they consider the
mistakes of the past _ such as the post-World War II draw-downs
that caught the military off guard at the break out of the Korean
War.
   While America's new military will be a smaller fighting force,
he said it should be trained to take on new roles and be prepared
to fight in Third World arenas, battle the nation's drug scourge or
help deal with such disasters as Hurricane Hugo and the San
Francisco-area earthquake.
   ``The Army must maintain its relevance to respond to various
requirements,'' Sullivan said.
   The planning officer said he is confident that the Army ``has
the structure to be able to respond to change,'' even though the
challenges of the future ``may be difficult to see'' at this time.
   ``We know where we're going and we know what we should look like
when we get there,'' he said.
   Army officers familiar with Vuono's plans walked the Pentagon's
halls with smiles on their faces after the Panama intervention,
touting the strike as an example of their future fighting force,
even if it is a smaller one.
   ``Versatile, deployable, lethal,'' chanted one Army colonel _
using the three catchwords that define the force's new proposals.
   ``Eighteen hours from stand to start _ it's the Army of the
future,'' said an Army general of the time required for the
Panamanian deployment.
   Another colonel pointed to the complex effort involved in
ferrying troops from both East and West U.S. coasts and dropping
some 3,000 paratroopers from 1,200 feet in the air, so that they
could team up with mechanized units and helicopters that had been
moved into Panama in advance.
   ``There wasn't one life lost in that nighttime parachute drop _
in World War II, they expected to lose between 10 to 15 percent of
their men,'' one officer said.

   Security forces opened fire on crowds of
anti-government protesters in the Romanian capital of Bucharest
today, and several demonstrators were killed, Yugoslav radio
reported.
   Military tanks rolled through the city and formed a circle
around several thousand mostly young people at a main intersection
in an effort to control the burgeoning unrest, said a Yugoslav
reporter.
   A Soviet news report from Bucharest said, ``Along the central
street of the capital, tanks are moving, following the lines of
submachine gunners pushing back the crowds. Bursts of automatic
weapons fire are being heard. Panic-stricken people are hiding in
doorways and courtyards.''
   The unrest was the first reported in the capital since
demonstrations against the hard-line president, Nicolae Ceausescu,
broke out over the weekend on the other side of the country in the
city of Timisoara.
   There were chilling reports by Yugoslav media that soldiers and
police who refused to shoot at demonstrators in Timisoara were
publicly executed. And Tass said workers occupied businesses in the
western city today and threatened to blow them up if demands for a
new government were not met.
   Hungarian radio said the Romanian Communist Party's ruling
Politburo was meeting in an unannounced session, which was likely
to discuss measures to curb the unrest. It said some protesters
chanted, ``The army is with us!''
   The unrest is the biggest challenge to Ceausescu's 24-year-long
authoritarian rule and reportedly has spread to a dozen cities.
Access to the country by foreign reporters is strictly curtailed,
but witnesses have said hundreds and perhaps thousands of people
have been killed.
   Shots were also reported fired today at protesters in the city
of Arad, about 40 miles from Timisoara. There was no immediate word
on casualties there. Security forces first used tear gas to try to
quell protests in Bucharest, a reporter for the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug said on Belgrade radio.
   The protest turned into ``bloody riots'' as police fired into
crowds and killed and wounded several people, the correspondent
said. The number of casualties was not known.
   The Yugoslav journalist, Petar Tomic of Yugoslavia's state-run
Tanjug news agency, said an armoured vehicle crushed two students.
Other students rushed to their aid and security forces opened fire,
killing or wounding around 20 people, Tomic said.
   
   The Western diplomat reported seeing at least four ambulances in
the city center shortly after the protests began.
   Tass reported ``a great many'' fire trucks and military vehicles
in the center of the city and said all approaches to the
Presidential Palace and Communist Party headquarters were blocked
by army units.
   ``The crowd of protesters, which first numbered a few hundred,
has now increased to several thousand,'' it reported. ``Those
gathered in the square are shouting the slogans `Freedom!' `Down
with dictatorship!' They are stopping buses and cars.''
   Security forces also fired on protesters during a general strike
in Arad, according to Klaus Lanz, a spokesman for ethnic German
Romanians based in Munich.
   A Romanian who arrived in Yugoslavia today from Timisoara said
that city was in the second day of a general strike. Asking that he
not be identified, he told reporters at the border he had heard
reports of demonstrations today in the southern city of Craiova and
in Suceava in the north.
   Tass said factories in Timisoara were closed and occupied by
workers who demanded that the government resign, the military leave
the city, and leaders be called to account for the loss of lives in
the city.
   ``According to the latest information, the military units have
started to leave,'' Tass said.
   In East Germany today, the government recalled its ambassador
from Bucharest, and Czechoslovakia issued a formal protest as
European nations formed a united front to condemn the repression.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said Ceausescu's days
are numbered and called for his replacement. But he ruled out
foreign intervention to topple Ceausescu, who has refused to adopt
the reforms accepted in other East bloc countries.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc today:
   _The Czechoslovak Communist Party voted to immediately disband
the hated paramilitary People's Militia, which was used to help
crush dissent, a day after publicly apologizing for its hard-line
policies of the past.
   _Hungary's Parliament paved the way for free elections next year
by voting to dissolve itself in March.
   The Western diplomat in Bucharest, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said by telephone that Ceausescu was interrupted today
at an official rally called to support his tough stance against
protesters.
   The speech was broadcast on radio and television. When shouts
erupted, the broadcast abruptly switched to patriotic music for
about three minutes. It then then resumed with Ceausescu in
mid-sentence.
   As Ceausescu returned to the air waves, people were heard loudly
applauding his promises of a higher minimum wage, increased
allowances for families with children, and other benefits
apparently intended to quell discontent, the diplomat said.
   But protesters then marched through the streets of Bucharest
shouting anti-Ceausescu slogans, the source said. Hungarian radio
said people burned banners they were issued for the pro-Ceausescu
rally.
   Witnesses say hundreds, possibly thousands, of unarmed people
were shot to death in Timisoara on Saturday and Sunday while
protesting Ceausescu.
   The 71-year-old president declared a state of emergency in the
Timisoara region Wednesday after tens of thousands of people
chanting ``Give us our dead!' reportedly protested.
   The Belgrade daily Politika quoted witnesses Wednesday as saying
they saw two soldiers and an officer killed ``on the spot'' by
security agents after refusing to fire on anti-government
demonstrators.
   The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that a group of Syrian
students arriving in Yugoslavia this morning from Timisoara said
demonstrations were still going on in the city during the night.
   A resident of Timisoara told Hungarian television that 80,000 to
90,000 people took part.
   Breaking his silence on the unrest Wednesday, Ceausescu blamed
the protests on ``hooligans'' incited by ``a brazen campaign of
slander and lies'' from abroad, especially Hungary.
   He has been accused by Budapest of persecuting ethnic
Hungarians, who are concentrated in the Transylvanian region that
includes Timisoara.

   Jailed black leader Nelson Mandela
held an emotional reunion Thursday with an ailing, 84-year-old
white women who was his co-defendant in a landmark anti-apartheid
trial 28 years ago.
   Helen Joseph, who in the 1960s was one of the first whites
banned by the government, spent four hours with Mandela in Victor
Verster Prison near Cape Town.
   ``He was in very good form, full of jokes, full of laughter,''
Ms. Joseph said outside the prison gate. ``He looks forward to
coming home, but he doesn't know when it will be.''
   She described the meeting as a ``wonderful, friendly, loving
visit.''
   Mandela, 71, heads the outlawed African National Congress
guerrilla movement and is the country's best known black leader. He
has been imprisoned for more than 27 years and is serving a life
sentence for plotting to overthrow the white-run government, but
his release is widely expected within weeks.
   Mandela and Ms. Joseph both emerged as leading voices of the
anti-apartheid movement in the 1950s. They were among more than 150
codefendants at a marathon treason trial from 1956-61.
   Ms. Joseph, now confined to a wheelchair most of the time,
recalled how she and Mandela often traveled together to the
courthouse in Pretoria. To take their minds off the trial, they
would take turns picking out homes where they would want to live,
she said.
   All the accused were acquitted, but the trial made clear the
government's intention to clamp down on opponents. Mandela went
underground shortly after the trial to form the ANC's armed wing.
He was arrested in 1962 and has been imprisoned since.
   Ms. Joseph resumed her anti-apartheid activities after the
trial, but was placed under police restrictions, including house
arrest, for most of the 1960s and 1970s. Police lifted the
restrictions in 1982, when she was 77. A year later she was
arrested for singing and giving a clenched-fist, black power salute
while attending a treason trial.
   Last year the ANC awarded her its highest award for her
``outstanding contribution to the struggle to end apartheid and
transform South Africa into a united, democratic and non-racial
country.''
   She still goes to anti-apartheid rallies in her wheelchair and
is greeted with rousing cheers by black audiences.
   She said both she and Mandela were excited to see one another
for the first time in 28 years. All her previous requests to visit
Mandela had been turned down.
   She said Mandela has agreed to meet government leaders,
including President F.W. de Klerk, because ``the time has come for
peaceful talks between the government and the ANC.''
   ``The ANC can't give up the armed struggle at this stage, but he
(Mandela) is very hopeful,'' said Ms. Joseph.
   She said Mandela believes ``de Klerk is a sincere person, but
his limitation will be what his National Party government will
allow him to do. He feels de Klerk is not a free man.''
   De Klerk says he wants to end discrimination and bring blacks
into the national government within five years. However, he opposes
a one-man, one-vote system and envisions a mechanism that will give
whites veto power on major policy decisions.

<HEAD>Former Conservative Party Chairman Denounces Hong Kong Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former Conservative Party chairman on Thursday
denounced as ``folly'' the government's plan to give residence
rights to 225,000 Hong Kong people.
   Norman Tebbit said he would join other Tory rebels to vote with
the opposition Labor Party against the policy, which he said has
split Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party ``from
top to bottom.''
   Conservatives have expressed concern the plan will encourage a
wave of immigration in Britain. The Labor Party called it
``divisive and elitist.''
   Tebbit spoke in favor of the past Conservative policy allowing
no further large-scale immigration and said British people fear
they will be ``swamped by people of different culture, history and
religion. ... The fact is that most people in Britain did not want
to live in a multicultural, multiracial society, but it has been
foisted on them.''
   The plan announced Wednesday by Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
aims to prevent a crippling brain drain from Hong Kong before it
reverts to rule by China when Britain's lease on the colony expires
in 1997.
   Hurd told the House of Commons that a maximum of 50,000 key
people in Hong Kong, plus their families, would be given full
British citizenship. He estimated the total at 225,000.
   Some 50 Tory members pledged to vote against the measure when it
is put to the House of Commons in the spring. Another 20 to 30
Tories might abstain, the British news agency Press Association
estimated.
   The Conservatives have 374 seats in the 650-seat Commons. Labor
has 229.
   ``The government's decision ... has split the party from top to
bottom,'' Tebbit said in an article he wrote for London's Evening
Standard. ``There is no doubt that in the Cabinet itself, the home
secretary and the foreign secretary led bitterly opposed factions.
   ``The word at present is that the final rebellion will be more
like 50 than 100.''
   He said party officials who ``saw the danger'' of Mrs.
Thatcher's policy ``failed to prevent such a folly.''
   Speaking earlier on BBC radio, Tebbit said the residence rights
would involve more than the number indicated by Hurd. It would mean
``wives and husbands, sisters, cousins, aunts and grandmothers,''
Tebbit said.
   About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese have British passports, but
no residence rights.
   Earlier, Foreign Office official Francis Maude repeated the
government's aim was not to encourage immigration from Hong Kong
but to allow key people to stay there under the Chinese by giving
them an ``escape route'' if they needed it.

   CBS asked officials of the United States and
Central American countries for help in finding one of its news
producers seized by gunmen in Panama, the president of CBS News
said Thursday.
   CBS' efforts won't stop until the producer, Jon Meyersohn, is
returned safely, David Burke said in a memo to his staff.
   Panamanian gunmen abducted Meyersohn, 33, and ABC News producer
Robert Campos on Wednesday morning as they stood in the lobby of a
hotel in Panama City. Campos, 31, was freed unharmed that afternoon.
   The two were among hundreds of journalists in Panama covering
the U.S. military assault to topple Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
and were staying at the Marriott Hotel in Panama City.
   Dozens of guests trapped at the seaside hotel were rescued late
Wednesday when U.S. paratroopers shot their way past armed people,
some believed to be Noriega loyalists, to reach the building.
   Meyersohn is married to ABC News producer Julie Hartenstein and
based in New York. He was producing reports for the ``CBS Evening
News'' when abducted with Campos and the hotel's resident manager,
Daniel Sarria.
   Sarria also still is missing.
   Burke told CBS News employees that ``every effort is being made
to locate Jon and bring him to safety.''
   That effort includes requests to the White House, the State
Department and the Pentagon, he said, and ``we also have been
working nonstop with countless other governments and private
individuals both in the U.S. and Central America.''
   His memo did not specify which Central American governments or
individuals were asked for help. Burke was not available Thursday
to comment.
   Meyersohn, with CBS News for 10 years, earlier this month helped
cover anti-government demonstrations in Czechoslovakia.
   He later produced reports on Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's meeting with Pope John Paul II in Rome, and the Malta

   Born in Illinois, raised in New York City and educated at the
University of Chicago, Meyersohn joined CBS News in 1978 as desk
assistant in its radio division. He later became an associate

   The FBI pressed the search for links between a
series a parcel bombs in the South and civil rights litigation,
reportedly questioning a Georgia lawyer about a 14-year-old racial
discrimination case.
   The FBI emphasized its investigation of the mail bombs that
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer remained
open-ended.
   In Macon, attorney Charles A. Mathis said Wednesday that the FBI
questioned one of his associates about a case in which his firm's
clients won a $3.75 million settlement over discrimination at
Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins. Mathis declined to name the
fellow lawyer or detail what he was asked.
   Another lawyer, Henry Grady Smith of Warner Robins, said he was
surprised to learn that his name was on the return address of a
package bomb sent to the NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla. That
bomb was defused Tuesday.
   ``I've never represented their organization. I'm not a civil
rights attorney,'' he said, adding that he was interviewed by the
FBI about the package Tuesday.
   ``I've never dealt with anybody in Jacksonville. I can't figure
out why anybody would use my name.''
   Earlier this week, a government source said the bomb that killed
U.S. Circuit Judge Robert S. Vance in Birmingham, Ala., on Saturday
bore the return address of a fellow judge who regularly sent Vance
packages.
   FBI spokesman Diader Rosario in Atlanta said agents have
interviewed everyone whose name appeared on the parcels, but ``we
do not consider them suspects or involved in any way, shape or
form.''
   FBI agent Jerry Shockley of Montgomery, Ala., said the bombs _
the two fatal bombs plus unexploded ones found at the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and a NAACP office in
Jacksonville, Fla. _ may have been sent by a racist group in
response to NAACP school desegregation lawsuits.
   Mississippi lawyer Richard Barrett, leader of a white
supremacist group called the Nationalist Movement, said he does not
think anyone in his or similar groups is to blame.
   ``I believe them to be the work of a deranged lunatic, that is
my first impression,'' Barrett said. ``I think that the American
people should not be stampeded by the liberal knee-jerk hysteria
that seems to be emanating from various quarters, including the
FBI.''
   The FBI today said it was installing 24-hour tip lines in
Birmingham, Ala., Jacksonville, Fla., and Atlanta to seek clues in
the investigation.
   In Birmingham, a telephoned bomb threat today forced evacuation
of a building that includes the office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court
judge who gave the eulogy for Vance on Wednesday. No explosive was
found, U.S. Marshal Tom Greene said.
   National and local judicial figures were among more than 700
mourners at a memorial service for Vance in a church guarded by
dozens of police officers and checked by dogs trained to smell for
bombs.
   Vance, a member of the 11th Circuit and a former chairman of the
Alabama Democratic Party, was killed instantly Saturday in his home
when he opened a package and the bomb exploded, sending finishing
nails into his lower abdomen. The bomb also wounded his wife.
   Two days later, another package bomb killed Robert E. Robinson,
a black lawyer in Savannah, Ga. A third bomb was found was found in
the court building that houses the 11th Circuit in Atlanta and a
fourth in the headquarters of the NAACP in Jacksonsville, Fla.
Those two bombs were defused.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford of Birmingham delivered
the eulogy for his close friend. He asked the mourners to ``put
aside our outrage for a while'' to honor Vance.
   ``The assassins were cheated if they thought that Bob Vance was
afraid to die,'' Fulford said.
   Vance's life, Fulford said, ``was the antithesis of our grief, a
life of fullness and gusto.''
   He described Vance as a strong believer in the law and a man
``who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed. ... No wonder
his assassins could not stand such a man in their presence.''

   An American schoolteacher who lived most of
her life in Panama was killed by stray machine-gun fire from
Panamanian forces during the early hours of the U.S. invasion, the
State Department said today.
   Candy Helin, a 43-year-old whose husband is a former Dixon
resident, was the only U.S. civilian reported killed in the attack
begun early Wednesday.
   Mrs. Helin was a teacher of gifted students at a U.S. government
school and is the daughter of a former Army port commander, family
members said.
   Her husband, Steve Helin, 45, is a civilian financial analyst
for the Panamerica Commission, an organization that oversees
operation of the Panama Canal, his sister said. The former U.S.
soldier has lived in Panama since 1962, when he joined the Army,
according to his family.
   Douglas Rose, a spokesman for the State Department's Panama Task
Force, said today that Mrs. Helin was killed by stray fire from the
Panamanian Defense Forces. He said he had no additional details of
her death.
   Helin's sister Jane Sheaffer of Dixon said Helin told her that
his wife was killed in an ambush near the Albrook Air Force Base as
the couple drove home on a dark road early Wednesday from dinner at
a friend's.
   ``Obviously, he's really distraught _ distraught, angry and
everything else, I suppose,'' Dean Sheaffer, Sheaffer's husband,
said of Helin. ``It just doesn't seem real. She was murdered by the
Panamanian government.''
   Mrs. Helin was told recently her teaching position was being
eliminated next year, but Mrs. Sheaffer said she did not know if
that meant the couple had planned on returning to the United States.
   The couple have two children, Stephanie, 16, and Tracey, 20,
family members said.
   Mrs. Sheaffer said her brother told her he did not know of the
impending danger. Mrs. Scheaffer said a memo warning U.S. civilians
to restrict their movements came after Helin had left work for the
day on Tuesday.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. troops today surrounded the
Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies after rumors spread that Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega may have fled there during the U.S. military
invasion that toppled his regime.
   The Nicaraguan government immediately ordered its army to
surround the U.S. Embassy in Managua until the siege on its embassy
ended.
   U.S. troops hunting for Noriega gained control of all major
Panamanian military bases after sporadic fighting late Wednesday
and early today.
   On Wednesday night, Noriega tried to rally his supporters by
making a brief radio address in which he vowed to ``win or die.''
   The general's loyalists apparently still held at least a dozen
Americans hostage. Armed thugs roamed through the capital today,
one day after the U.S. attack on Panama in which at least 18
Americans died.
   After rumors spread that Noriega or other members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces high command were in the Nicaraguan and
Cuban embassies, U.S. troops in armored personnel carriers
surrounded the two missions.
   One armored personnel carrier driver had to ask a reporter for
directions, and a soldier laying concertina wire at the Nicaraguan
Embassy said, ``We're just securing exits.''
   The Nicaragua government, which has fought the U.S.-supported
Contra rebels for eight years, ordered its troops to surround the
U.S. Embassy in Managua until U.S. troops withdrew from the
perimeter of its embassy in Panama City.
   Several hours later, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher
said that ``tanks or armored vehicles'' were surrounding the U.S.
Embassy in Managua. ``There is some sort of activity like that
going on,'' he said in Washington.
   Heavy fighting raged in the middle-class suburb of San Miguelito
just before dawn, marked by machine-gun fire, grenade explosions
and light artillery fire. U.S. aircraft and helicopters flew
overhead and drew ground fire.
   By daybreak today, the fighting had ceased, and U.S. Army troops
patrolled the streets as many Panamanians began looting shops once
more. There was no evidence U.S. troops were trying to halt the
looting.
   U.S. military officials said most of the fighting between
pro-Noriega forces and American troops has subsided and that little
real threat remains.
   Col. Ronald Sconyers, spokesman for the U.S. Southern Command,
told a pool of Pentagon reporters Wednesday that much of the
gunfire still being heard around the country is from roving bands
of Noriega's civilian ``Dignity Battalions'' who were ``just
getting their last licks in.''
   Meanwhile, the Panama Canal opened today after closing
Wednesday, the first time anything other than a landslide has
forced the 75-year-old canal to close. The 43-mile-long waterway
will be open only during daytime until at least the weekend, the
Panama Canal Commission said in a statement from Washington.
   Shortly before midnight Wednesday, a day of terror ended for 29
Americans and other foreigners at the Marriott hotel when about 90
paratroopers from the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division secured the
building after firefight.
   Armed Panamanians had raided the hotel periodically and abducted
guests, eventually freeing all but two, the hotel's manager and a
CBS news producer.
   The hotel was cleared of guests today, and there were reports
that U.S. soldiers were exchanging gunfire with Noriega loyalists,
a Marriott spokesman in Washington said.
   In addition, the Smithsonian Institution said 11 scientists and
technicians were missing from a research institute and believed
taken hostage.
   Pentagon officials said finding American hostages is a ``primary
concern.''
   Noriega surfaced with an ominous message. He said on a
government-run FM radio station that he will now lead a guerrilla
war against the United States.
   ``We're in trench warfare now and we will maintain the
resistance,'' he said. ``We ask the world for help, with men,
dignity and strength. Our slogan is to win or die, not one step
back.''
   The general's whereabouts could not be determined, and it was
unclear whether he had substantial forces under his command.
Journalists recognized the voice on the radio Wednesday night as
Noriega's.
   In Washington, Pentagon officials said troops may have to head
into the jungle to pursue Noriega units.
   The United States was offering a $1 million reward for Noriega
and $150 for each firearm surrendered.
   American forces appealed today in radio broadcasts for members
of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces to surrender.
   ``Do not fight for a small group of drug traffickers. Remember
the oath you took when you joined such an honorable institution as
the Defense Forces,'' one broadcast said in Spanish. ``Your fellow
citizens are asking your help to restore democracy.''
   Pentagon officials said about 1,500 U.S.-based reinforcements
were flown into the country late Wednesday to assist an exhausted
attack force and prepare to flush Noriega loyalists out of Panama
City.
   That effectively doubled to 24,000 the number of U.S. troops
that had been in the country before President Bush ordered
``Operation Just Cause'' in a bid to topple the general who has
been a thorn in the side of two U.S. presidents.
   Bush initially ordered 9,500 troops to Panama to augment 13,000
at bases along the Panama Canal.
   The Bush administration declared the operation a military
success. At least 18 Americans were dead, 117 wounded and one
missing. Also, one American female dependent was killed.
   Noriega's president, Francisco Rodriguez, said more than 60
Panamanians had been killed and hundreds were wounded, many of them
civilians.
   By late Wednesday, U.S. troops controlled most Panamanian bases
and the government television station. They had also knocked out a
radio tower, silencing the national network that had broadcast
appeals for resistance and military messages.
   Bush said in a speech Wednesday morning that he ordered the
invasion to bring Noriega to trial in the United States on 1988
cocaine-trafficking charges, to protect the 35,000 Americans in
Panama and to restore democracy.
   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara, winner of the May 7
elections that were voided by the Noriega-controlled government,
was sworn in as president. Also sworn in were First Vice President
Ricardo Arias Calderon and Second Vice President Guillermo
``Billy'' Ford.
   None surfaced by late Wednesday, however, and a call for public
demonstrations of support drew no visible reaction.
   Noriega declared Friday that Panama was in a ``state of war''
with Washington and a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed the next
day in what American officials called an unprovoked shooting.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III claimed the administration
had received unconfirmed reportes that Noriega planned to order an
attack on an American residential neighborhood in Panama.
   U.S. forces began the attack by pounding Panamanian military
bases in and around the capital with mortar, cannon and machine-gun
fire. Noriega's headquarters in the densely populated neighborhood
of Chorillo was gutted.
   U.S. troops took 150 Panamanians prisoner and were holding them
in an automobile storage lot, a report from Pentagon pool reporters
said.
   The U.S. invasion was the biggest chapter in Washington's long
war with Noriega, a career soldier who had a strong core of support
among working-class people and who seemed to delight in defying the
mighty United States.
   Noriega survived two coup attempts from within his Defense
Forces and Washington's best non-military efforts to oust him,
including harsh economic sanctions that severely depressed the
economy.
   Bush ordered the sanctions lifted Wednesday and said he intended
to turn over the Panama Canal as required under existing treaties.

   District Attorney Harry Connick and actor
Paul Burke pleaded innocent Thursday to charges that they schemed
to help an arrested bookie continue a gambling operation.
   The two were among nine people indicted Dec. 15. Magistrate
Louis Moore Jr. set bond at $10,000 apiece for Connick, Burke and
four others, and at $20,000 apiece for convicted bookmaker Walton
Aucoin, 49, and Steven Bertolino, 57, accused of taking part in the
bookmaking operation. All were allowed to sign for their bonds
without putting up cash.
   ``I did nothing wrong. ... The allegations are pure D baloney,''
said Connick, who gained notoriety this year with a continuing
attempt to revive Louisiana's anti-abortion laws. He could get up
to 25 years in prison and a $250,000 fine if convicted on the
charges against him.
   The indictment accuses Connick of giving Aucoin gambling records
seized when Aucoin was arrested in December 1988. Connick has said
it was proper to give Aucoin records needed for his defense.
   A grand jury said the records were provided to help Aucoin
continue collecting and paying gambling debts.
   Connick has repeatedly said the indictment is the result of a
personal vendetta by U.S. Attorney John Volz, who began the federal
investigation but later turned it over to the U.S. Justice
Department in Washington.
   Also charged in the case are Wilson P. Abraham, 70, a New
Orleans real estate developer who pleaded innocent Wednesday,
William G. Condon, 34; Iris Ethridge, 30; Aucoin's daughter,
Darleen Aucoin Toca, 27; and Patrick Fanning, a defense lawyer who
was once an assistant district attorney and an assistant U.S.
attorney.
   Aucoin, Bertolino, Condon, Ms. Ethridge and Ms. Toca were
charged with owning and conducting a New Orleans-based illegal
interstate gambling operation that allegedly netted as much as
$2,000 a day. Fanning, Abraham and Burke were charged with aiding
the operation by helping Connick cook up an excuse for returning
the records Aucoin needed to keep it going.
   The excuse was, according to the indictment, that Aucoin needed
the records to pay his federal gambling stamp taxes.
   Burke was once a star of television's ``The Naked City'' and
appeared in ``The Valley of the Dolls'' and other movies. He is a
New Orleans native now living in Palm Springs, Calif., according to
the indictment.
   Connick wants to act as his own co-counsel along with defense
lawyer Bill Wessels, Wessels told the court.
   The trial was tenatively set for March 1.

   ``Santa knows who's naughty and nice,'' police Sgt. Don Lacher

arrest Wednesday. ``I said: `Look, Santa says lay down on the

   Lacher, 35, was dressed as Santa and on his way to a gift
giveaway when he got a burglary call over his patrol car radio.
   Lacher and his uniformed partner, Officer Anthony Trout, rushed
to an apartment complex where they found a man and a woman loading
a car with nearly $2,000 worth of suspected stolen goods.
   The pair arrested Villalobos and Anna Marie Gallegos, 29, both
of Pomona, for investigation of burglary and possession of a loaded
firearm.

   A house fire claimed the lives of three
children while their mother was with friends wrapping Christmas
presents, authorities said Thursday.
   The Nickels family moved to Maine in September from California,
following the death of the children's father in a car crash. The
family's home had been burglarized soon after they moved here, Fire
Chief Duane Brasslett said.
   When firefighters arrived at their house late Wednesday,
16-year-old Michael Nickels was yelling for help from a third-story
window. He told firefighters there were other children inside.
   He died along with Laura Ann Nickels, 4, and brother Brian, 6,
said Fire Capt. David Martin. A brother, David, 11, jumped out a
second-story window to escape the flames, Martin said.
   Michael fell inside the building and could not be immediately
rescued. He died on the way to a hospital, said the chief.
   Their mother, Jennifer Nickels, was with friends in nearby Old
Town wrapping Christmas presents, officials said.
   Autopsies were planned. The house was gutted, and Brasslett said
the cause of the fire was not known.

   Poland's Communist Party is losing touch
with a critical constituency: the workers, its leaders said
Thursday.
   So few actual workers were elected as delegates to the party's
crucial national congress set for next month that the leadership
may issue special invitations, said Janusz Bisztyga, the central
committee spokesman.
   ``The share of workers is disquietingly low,'' Bisztyga said.
``We have called on all party groups to work out a different
solution.''
   The percentage of workers has not been calculated while delegate
elections continue, but the spokesman offered two examples of the
problem: the Baltic province of Slupsk, with only one worker and
two farmers among the 22 delegates, and the central area of Kielce,
with only four blue-collar workers among the 44 delegates.
   The situation is dire for the party, created for the
proletariat, said Wieslaw Veitz, a sociologist and party member,
during a news conference called to discuss the congress, which
meets Jan. 27.
   ``It is not that the party leadership is losing touch with the
base. In fact there is no contact with the base, because if we had
contact, the situation would not be as it is now,'' he said.
   The Communists' iron grip on Poland's government and economy
broke in the last year. First, they turned to the independent
Solidarity movement they had sought to crush, seeking help with the
economic crisis and social unrest. Then they suffered a stinging
popular rejection during unprecedented democratic parliament
elections, leading to the East bloc's first non-Communist prime
minister and a Solidarity-led cabinet.
   Now huge government budget subsidies and tax exemptions that
funded Communist Party activites are ceasing Jan. 1, while economic
reform is radically reducing the role of the party in state-run
industries. And within four years, the party will have to face
fully free elections.
   The party congress, the 11th since the Communists consolidated
power in postwar Poland, may be its last in its current form.
Struggling to retain a place in the nation's political future, the
party is expected to adopt a new name and a program that will cast
it as broadly leftist supporting parliamentary democracy.
   ``Today the party's future is being discussed by a narrow group
of intelligentsia, and lacks participation from the workers,'' said
Zbigniew Sobotka, an alternate Politburo member from the Warsaw
steel works.
   ``If we are to discuss the future of the party, we should give
the floor to the people who have been most identified with the
party so far,'' he said.
   ``We do not want a situation where after the congress there is
no base of membership to support the reformed party.''
   A Workers Congress Forum was created at factories in Warsaw to
generate interest in party issues among the workers who Sobotka
described as frustrated by slow party reform and the leadership.
   In preparation for the congress, new rules were established for
more democratic election of the 1,500 delegates. Previously,
participants were approved by party leaders.
   But Sobotka said that in the elections, ``members of the
intelligentsia have an advantage. ... They are more eloquent than
the workers.''
   Among the alternatives being considered to bolster worker
representation at the congress are inviting delegations from
factories to speak to the session, allowing factories to elect the
guests and making them full delegates to the congress of any new
party that is formed, Sobotka said.
   Also, said Zenon Szoda, a Polish Academy of Science professor,
``We do not confine ourselves to the working class, we mean people
who are gainfully employed. We do not reject people who have
production means _ private farmers, private entrepreneurs.''
   The party has a membership of just under 2.1 million in a nation
of 39 million, down 1 million in the last decade and 35,000 in the
first half of 1989, according to an August report.
   About 37.5 percent of the members are workers, compared with
52.1 percent who are members of the intelligentsia: managers,
teachers and others whose jobs require higher education. The rest
are in agriculture.
   The Central Committee reported in October that 72 percent of
members favored changing the name, charter and program of the party
that was formed in 1948. The report said there were 70 proposals
for a new name.
   Polish Communists have been studying their Hungarian
counterparts, who voted Oct. 7 to scrap the old party and replace
it with a socialist one.

   Officials have rejected an offer by an
Italian Communist to buy a statue of Vladimir I. Lenin that was
removed from a public square after violent anti-Soviet
demonstrations, it was reported Thursday.
   Robert Napoleone, a member of the Italian Communist Party who
owns a Rome publishing house, offered to give the 30-foot monument
``a place worthy of a great revolutionary.''
   But the local government council in Nowa Huta, the idustrial
suburb built as a model socialist city in 1950s, decided the statue
``cannot be the object of such a transaction,'' according to the
state news agency PAP.
   The council also rejected a proposal by a Warsaw resident ``who
was stressing in the offer his financial and political
independence,'' PAP said.
   Demonstrators shouting ``Soviets go home!'' had tried to destroy
the statue and clashed with police during protests in November and
early December. The statue was quietly removed the night of Dec. 10.

   An earthquake measuring 5.2 on the Richter
scale occurred today near McGrath, Alaska, the U.S. Geological
Survey reported.
   The epicenter was about 30 miles southeast of McGrath, and the
quake was felt strongly in the McGrath area, according to the
survey. Numerous quakes have occurred in this region in the past,
it said.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or injury, the survey
said.
   The quake occurred at 7:53 a.m. Alaska Standard Time (1:53 p.m.
EST), the survey said.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 isa ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.
   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before the
Richter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richter
scale.

   A Nicaraguan diplomat was intercepted by
gunmen on a street and shot to death Thursday, authorities said.
   The victim was identified as Jorge Adolfo Vargas, a second
secretary at the Nicaraguan Embassy, said a fire department officer
who insisted on anonymity.
   Vargas, 38, was intercepted by the gunmen as he was walking to
the embassy in the southeastern part of the capital, shot him and
fled, the officer said.
   The fire department was told of the shooting by an anonymous
telephone caller. No one claimed responsibility for the killing.
   By the time a fire brigade arrived on the scene, Vargas was
already dead, the officer said. The body was taken to the city
morgue, where he was identified.
   An employee at the Nicaraguan Embassy, who answered the
telephone but refused to give his name, confirmed that Vargas had
been assassinated. He said he had no further information.
   Leftist guerrillas have been active in Guatemala for more than
four decades, as have secret rightist death squads who have been
hunting down suspected rebels.

   A Palestinian suspected in the bombing of
Pan Am Flight 103 was convicted Thursday in a series of terrorist
attacks in northern Europe four years ago, along with three
co-defendants.
   The Palestinian, Mohammed Abu Talb, was sentenced to life in
prison, which in Sweden generally means 20 years at most behind
bars. He is expected to be expelled after serving his time, the
court said.
   The verdicts were delivered on the first anniversary of the
bombing of Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 270
people.
   A Swedish newspaper Thursday said new evidence had surfaced
linking Abu Talb to the attack, including a calendar found in his
apartment with the date Dec. 21 circled.
   Abu Talb, a 35-year-old former bodyguard in the radical
Palestine Popular Struggle Front, and co-defendant Marten Imandi
received life sentences for bombing the Northwest Orient airlines
office in Copenhagen in 1985. One person was killed and more than
20 were wounded.
   Two brothers, Mahmoud and Moustafa Al Mougrabi, were given
sentences of six years and one year respectively for their
involvement in three attacks in Copenhagen and Amsterdam.
   All the defendants were acquitted in a fourth incident in
Stockholm in 1986. The case was decided by a judicial panel.
   ``The type of crime ... is extremely serious. It is directed
against the lives and property of innocent people. Society must
react very strongly against such crimes,'' said the court in its
100-page decision.
   Abu Talb's attorney said he would appeal the conviction, which
was based largely on the testimony of Mahmoud Al Mougrabi.
   In addition to the Northwest Orient office, the men were
convicted in bombings at a Cophenhagen synagogue, where seven
people were hurt, and the offices of El Al Israel airlines in the
Danish capital and in Amsterdam. No one was injured in those
explosions.
   Abu Talb was arrested in May in connection with the attacks. He
came under suspicion in the Lockerbie case after Swedish
investigators established he had been in Malta about the time the
Lockerbie bomb may have been prepared. The altitude-sensitive bomb
apparently was hidden in a radio-cassette recorder, which was
placed in a suitcase and wrapped in clothing bought in Malta.
   Abu Talb's lawyer, Sven-Erik Sjogren, repeated his client's
denial that he was involved in the Flight 103 incident and said his
trip to Malta was for business.
   Last month, police seized clothing from Abu Talb's home in
Uppsala, about 40 miles north of Stockholm, to compare it with
shreds found in Lockerbie and with clothing from a boutique in
Malta.
   Sjogren has challenged the legality of the raid, but he said he
understood the clothing already had been flown to Malta for
analysis.
   A Swedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, reported Thursday that
Scottish detectives were disappointed with the results of the
examination in Malta.
   Dagens Nyheter said further evidence has surfaced linking Abu
Talb with Lockerbie. Police found a 1988 calendar with the date
Dec. 21 circled, it said.
   After the police raid, Abu Talb's wife also was recorded in a
wiretapped telephone call warning another Palestinian, who was not
identified, to ``get rid of the clothes immediately,'' the paper
said. Police later seized a suitcase from the family she called,
the paper added.
   Abu Talb came to Sweden from Syria with his wife and child on a
false Moroccan passport under the name of Belaid Massoud Ben Hadi.
He settled in Uppsala and ran a store specializing in Arabic foods
and videotapes.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dozens of guests hiding in a seaside
luxury hotel cheered when a battalion of elite U.S. airborne troops
shot their way through a neighborhood to reach the building.
   The troops' arrival late Wednesday night ended a day of terror
for 30 to 40 guests and staff, who had endured several raids and
abductions by armed Panamanians after the U.S. assault to topple
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The gunmen seized 15 people, and all but two eventually were
released. Jon Meyersohn of CBS and Daniel Sarria, the hotel's
resident manager, were apparently still being held hostage early
today.
   Lt. Col. Harry Axson, the battalion commander, said his unit,
based several miles away in Old Panama, had received direct orders
from Secretary of State James Baker III to secure the hotel within
three hours. They did it, but not without several skirmishes with
Panamanian forces.
   Three American soldiers were wounded during the trek, Axson said.
   He said he did not know if the combat was with members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces but that he believed at least some were
members of ``Dignity Battalions,'' bands of armed thugs loyal to
Noriega.
   Later today, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
denied that Baker had ordered U.S. forces to secure the hotel.
   She said Baker called Defense Secretary Dick Cheney twice to
relay information on the situation at the hotel. But any contention
Baker was issuing orders to the military is ``100 percent erroneous
and false,'' she said.
   Guests first heard the sound of American aircraft and helicopter
gunships overhead Wednesday night, then the crack of small-arms
fire getting louder by the minute. Then came the voices, but it
wasn't clear who they belonged to.
   Finally, about 90 members of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division
marched in.
   It was 11:22 p.m. and the guests, huddled together in two rooms,
cheered and applauded the troops.
   The GIs took the guests to the hotel casino, handed out sodas,
cookies and crackers, and settled in for the night as evacuation
plans were made.
   Roger Conners, a Marriott spokesman in Washington, D.C., said
today that the Panama City hotel has been cleared of all guests and
employees and that the only occupants are U.S. troops, who have set
up a command post. He said an Army captain who telephoned him
reported that shots were being exchanged with Panamanians,
apparently members of the Dignity Battalions.
   Axson, a veteran of the 1983 Grenada invasion, said his troops
had not rested since early Monday morning but were in high spirits.
   Officials of the Marriott Corp. said earlier Wednesday they were
pressing the U.S. government to ensure the safety of guests at the
400-room hotel after the military assault to capture Noriega.
   Roger Conner, a spokesman for Bethesda, Md.-based Marriott, said
most of the guests were journalists and airline workers, along with
a few business people.
   At one point, some hotel guests were so fearful of giving away
their position that they refused to let three reporters make
telephone calls for about four hours during the afternoon.
   The first raid on the hotel by Panamanians occurred shortly
after the U.S. military assault began around midnight Tuesday.
   Armed men entered the hotel again about 1 p.m. By then, a few
guests had managed to flee, but drivers were difficult to come by.
One driver fled when he learned his riders would be Americans.
   The hotel is popular with Americans and is less than two miles
from the U.S. Embassy.
   Capt. Jay Skinner, a 23-year Eastern veteran, said he could not
understand why federal officials in Miami said Tuesday it was safe
to fly into Panama.
   Skinner, who makes the Miami-Panama run twice every five days,
said Eastern had been in contact with the Pentagon and the State
Department in addition to the Federal Aviation Administration.
   ``Why did they allow an American flag carrier in?'' asked
Skinner, 45, of Sunrise, Fla. His Boeing 727, with 117 passengers
aboard, landed only a few hours before the fighting began, and he
and his crew were virtual prisoners in the hotel for most of
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Capital Spending Increases Expected To Slow Next Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses plan to boost capital
spending in 1990, but the rate of increase is only a little more
than half this year's and includes the first decline in
durable-goods investment since 1986, the government said Thursday.
   Analysts saw the report as more evidence of manufacturing
sluggishness.
   According to a Commerce Department survey completed in November,
spending on new plants and equipment will total $490.1 billion next
year, a 4.9 percent jump but less than the 8.5 percent increase in
1989 spending over that in 1988.
   The 4.9 percent rate of increase is the slowest since a 4.2
percent advance in 1987, the department said.
   The report, said Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for
the WEFA Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting group, means
``capital spending is not going to be the contributing factor to
the economy in 1990, at least not like it was ... for much of
1989.''
   David Jones, an economist for Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., New York,
said the survey ``reflects the pattern of weakness that is
concentrated in the manufacturing sector.''
   ``We've had weakness in manufacturing, particularly in autos,
but that's spreading now to computers, defense-related
industries,'' Jones said. ``And that's causing business to turn
more cautious.''
   In addition to a softness in orders for manufactured goods,
Chimerine said corporate debt also is a factor in the slowing of
capital spending.
   ``A lot of companies are paying a lot of interest to service
their debt,'' Chimerine said. ``It's squeezing profits ... so the
report is no surprise. They only question is, will it get much
weaker?''
   In the latest survey, manufacturing companies said they planned
a 1.4 percent increase in capital outlays to $182.8 billion,
compared with a 7.3 percent increase to $180.2 billion in 1989.
   This includes a 1.5 percent decrease in plants that produce
durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last more than three
years _ and a 4.0 percent gain in companies producing non-durable
goods. The last decline in the durable-goods sector was a 6.7
percent drop in 1986.
   Durable-goods plants increased their investments 4.2 percent in
1989 and non-durable investments were up 10 percent.
   Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other
non-manufacturing ventures indicated they would increase spending
by 7.1 percent to $307.3 billion, compared with a gain of 9.2
percent to $286.9 billion this year.
   Before adjusting for inflation, 1990 plant and equipment
spending is expected to rise 6.4 percent to $505 billion in 1990.
The latest estimate for 1989 spending is $475 billion, 10.3 percent
more than in 1988.

   Church bells pealed today at the precise moment one year ago
that a bomb blew Pan Am Flight 103 out of the sky, and the airline
took out full-page ads urging the public to remember the 270
victims on the anniversary of their death.
   Several U.S. towns scheduled memorial services for those who
lost loved ones in the terror attack on the Boeing 747 over
Lockiebie, Scotland. The unsolved bombing killed 259 passengers and
11 people on the ground.
   In Washington, more than 20 members of victims' families planned
to take part in a 90-minute candlelight memorial service at Holy
Trinity Church. Guests were to include Sir Antony Acland, Britian's
ambassador to the United States.
   ``One year a today, 270 lives were lost in one senseless,
barbaric act. At 2:02 p.m. (EST) today, we ask you to join us in
pausing for a moment of prayer for these and all other victims of
terrorism all over the world,'' Pan Am said in full-page ads placed
in nine newspapers, including The New York Times, USA Today and The
Annandale (Scotland) Herald.
   Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said memorial services would be
held today at New York's Kennedy Airport, in London and in
Frankfurt, West Germany. The jet was en route to New York from
London; Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt.
   In Ramsey, N.J., where people gathered at an elementary school
to commemorate New Jersey's 38 victims, church bells pealed at 2:02
p.m, the exact time locally that the jet blew up. Bells were to
ring for 270 seconds, one second for each victim.
   In Pennsylvania, Blessed Sacrament Cathedral in Greensburg rang
its bells at 2:02 p.m. for 270 seconds as well. Two students at
Greensburg's Seton Hill College were among the victims of the
bombing.
   ``In memory of all those people who we knew or were in some way
connected with the parish, we felt this was a fitting memorial on
this day,'' said the Rev. Donald Mondello, rector of the Roman
Catholic cathedral.
   Bells pealed also at Syracuse University, and handful of people
attended a university chapel service for the 35 Syracuse students
killed in the bombing. University chaplain Paul Kowalewski read
aloud the names of the students.
   ``It was very quiet and meditative,'' Kowalewski said. ``People
there were in a somber mood.''
   University spokesman Darryl Geddes said Hendricks Chapel would
be open for silent prayer all day, with a brief service at 5 p.m.
He said most students have gone home for the Christmas break and
few people are expected to attend. About 550 people attended
memorial services Dec. 13 for the Flight 103 victims at the chapel.
   ``I don't think for any of us Christmas will ever be the same,''
Bert Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., whose brother Tom perished in
the tragedy, said Sunday. He is a founding member of the support
group Families of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.
   At least 20 American relatives crossed the Atlantic to mourn
with the 3,500 residents of Lockerbie. Organizers planned two
simple remembrance services. Pan Am offered to fly families of the
victims to the memorials.
   The wife of Pan Am 103 pilot James MacQuarry said today she is
not yet ready to visit the crash site.
   ``Some other time, but not now,'' said Janet MacQuarry, who
planned a quiet gathering of friends and family at her house in
Kensington, N.H., tonight.
   Investigators say the bomb that brought down the plane was made
of powerful plastic explosives concealed in a radio-cassette
player. Police have said one focus of their investigation is the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command, a
radical Syria-based faction.

   For the first time that anybody could
remember, Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu was interrupted at a
public speech by boos and jeers that began a huge demonstration
against him in Bucharest Thursday.
   Dressed in a black Persian lamb hat with matching coat collar,
Ceausesecu, 71, was about three minutes into one of his typically
rousing speeches when, according to a Yugoslav journalist in
Bucharest, a crowd of young people, quickly joined by hundreds of
sympathizers marched close by.
   All that viewers on state television and listeners on state
radio knew of the demonstration was the muffled sound of boos and
jeers before live broadcast abruptly stopped.
   Ceausescu, Romania's hard-line leader for 24 years, was midway
through a sentence thanking the organizers of his own rally on the
square in front of his official residence, the elegant palace that
until the Communist takeover in 1947 housed the nation's kings.
   Radio and TV quickly switched to stirring patriotic songs. But
Hungarian TV showed more footage of a disconcerted Ceausescu,
clearly aware something was amiss, and a man advising him, ``Come
inside.''
   Three minutes later, the broadcast resumed, again catching
Ceausescu midway through a sentence, this time a stirring appeal to
defend ``the independence, integrity and sovereignty of Romania.''
   Eastern Europe's longest surviving ruler has made many such
appeals in his 24 years as the autocratic boss of Romania.
   The appeals are intended to touch the raw nerve of Romanian
nationalism, long played upon by Ceausescu in his vision of a great
Romania with himself as its undisputed greatest leader ever.
   But the increasing hardships he has imposed on 23 million
people, and the reported massacre of unarmed civilians in the west
Romanian city of Timisoara last weekend, apparently have united
ethnic Hungarians, Germans and Romanians in revolt.
   According to reports from East bloc journalists in Bucharest,
the crowd that interrupted Ceausescu's speech was undeterred by
tear gas grenades.
   About 25 minutes after his mass rally drew to a close, thousands
of mostly young people marched down the nearby central Magheru
boulevard, chanting ``Down with Ceausescu!'' and calling for the
``libertate'' _ or ``freedom'' _ that is coming to their East
European and Soviet neighbors.
   Submachine gunners and tanks tried to push the crowds back, and
bursts of automatic weapons fire were heard as the protesters moved
toward an intersection ringed by the imposing buildings of the
university, the national theater and the 22-story Intercontinental
Hotel.
   There, according to a Yugoslav journalist, the crowd was
encircled by tanks, riot police, troops and special security forces.
   There was a lull in the shooting, during which a Bulgarian
correspondent said elderly people entreated the security forces not
to move against the protesters.
   Shouts of ``The army is with us!'' rang out, a Hungarian
correspondent said.
   But then, according to Yugoslav journalist Petar Tomic of
Tanjug, an armored vehicle ran over two students. Others who went
to help were mown down with gunshots, with about 20 people killed
or wounded.
   A British diplomat told television in London that at least eight
or nine corpses were seen in the streets.
   Elsewhere, the city was quiet, according to a Swiss diplomat
interviewed by Swiss radio. The airport and outskirts, while
heavily patrolled by security forces, seemed untouched by the furor
in the center, he reported.
   Romanians who listened to their own media would have known
nothing. Radio retransmitted Ceausescu's speech, editing out the
offending jeers. Television, which normally transmits only two
hours a night in the shortage-plagued Balkan nation, simply did not
start its usual 8 p.m. broadcast, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   Radio Free Europe broadcasts in Romanian, and the station is a
lifeline to the rest of the world in a country that now receives
few Western visitors, and sells no foreign newspapers _ not even
those of its allies in the Warsaw Pact.
   Some have adjusted their TV antennas to receive Hungarian,
Yugoslav, Soviet or Bulgarian news.

   A sometimes sobbing Tammy Faye Bakker told
a church congregation of her life without Jim Bakker and how she's
hired an appeals lawyer to get her husband out of prison.
   ``Our lawyer felt we have a 77 percent chance, praise the
Lord,'' Mrs. Bakker said to thunderous applause at the Carpenter's
Home Church on Wednesday.
   Bakker is in a Rochester, Minn., federal prison serving a
45-year sentence for defrauding investors of the PTL Ministry,
which he founded.
   Mrs. Bakker defended her husband, saying he is incapable of
defrauding anybody.
   ``Jim walks in his own steps,'' she said. ``He doesn't walk in
the judge's steps. He doesn't walk in the government's steps. Who
are we to say his steps were not supposed to walk through prison?''
   The Rev. Karl Strader said he invited Mrs. Bakker to speak after
she came to the church Sunday to see a play. He said the invitation
was his way of showing friendship to the Bakkers during the
holidays and help her financially.
   The church did not compensate Mrs. Bakker, but a collection was
taken after her talk to pay for airfare for her and her son to
travel to the Minnesota prison during Christmas.
   The Bakkers' New Covenant church set up following the PTL
scandals has been moving from storefront to storefront in Orlando
because of financial problems.

   Actor Arnold Schwarzenegger accepted substantial
undisclosed libel damages Thursday for an untrue story in a tabloid
that claimed he held ``fervent Nazi and anti-Semitic views.''
   Schwarzenegger's lawyer, James Price, told the High Court it was
now accepted by News Group Newspapers Ltd., publishers of the News
of the World, and journalist Sharon Ring, that there was no truth
in any of the allegations.
   The Feb. 21, 1988, editions of the Sunday paper also alleged
that Schwarzenegger, a native of Austria, was a ``secret admirer of
Adolf Hitler.''
   Robert Clinton, the paper's lawyer, said his clients deeply
regretted the damage and distress caused.
   ``My clients accept that Mr. Schwarzenegger has never espoused
Nazi and anti-Semitic views and has never been an admirer of Adolf
Hitler and what he and his evil regime represent,'' he said.

   Tiny Tim appeared before the city
commission and tiptoed his way through an endorsement of a
sculptor's effort to live in a storefront studio.
   Local artists figured the 1960s celebrity could help sculptor
Darien Bogart persuade city commissioners Wednesday to let Bogart
live in a downtown studio.
   Tiny Tim, who is in town for club performances, was glad to
oblige. He even stopped to serenade passers-by plucking his ukulele
on the steps of City Hall.
   But as Tiny Tim stood before the City Commission, dressed in a
multicolored coat and a red, white and blue striped tie, his
support of Bogart wavered.
   ``I'm supportive with a lot of ifs,'' Tiny Tim said.
   It might be all right if Bogart kept the place clean and didn't
bother neighboring businesses, he said.
   But later: ``I can't see him living in a store that is on a main
thoroughfare. The danger there also is that others may follow suit.
To make it a thing to spread, right now it appears to be out of
taste.''
   Commissioners decided to research the issue and reconsider it in
February.

   Singer Glen Campbell has come to the aid of a
5{-month-old boy whose doctors say will die unless he gets a liver
transplant.
   Charles and Jule Tenuta of Phoenix are trying to get their son,
Tommie, on a waiting list at the University of Chicago Medical
Center. But they don't have the required $100,000 down payment.
About $32,000 has been raised.
   Campbell, a Phoenix resident, announced Wednesday that he will
hold a benefit concert Jan. 9 at a nightclub and that the proceeds
would go toward paying for Tommie's transplant.
   ``You can raise money for a lot of things, and this little baby
comes up and he does need a liver transplant,'' Campbell said
Wednesday.
   Tommie's doctor, Dennis Shermeta, said the University of Chicago
Medical Center offers alternatives not available in Arizona. The
Chicago hospital recently performed the nation's first two living
donor liver transplant operations.
   Mrs. Tenuta said she would be willing to donate part of her
liver, but that the first order of business is to move to Chicago
with her son.

   Six of the seven O'Kelley brothers _ who
fought to remain together after their mother died, their father
abandoned them and their home burned down _ held a reunion on the
set where their story is being filmed.
   During an interview Wednesday with the television show,
``Entertainment Tonight,'' the brothers were asked how the movie
will affect them.
   ``We'll get some publicity, but in a couple of months it will be
back to normal,'' said Michael, 15.
   After news of their family disaster put the rural Gainesville
brothers in the spotlight in 1986 and 1987, they received more than
$200,000 in cash and gifts and a contract for the
made-for-television movie, ``Fire in the Heart.''
   A contractor also built them a four-bedroom house on the
7.5-acre farm where they had lived in a trailer.
   The attention also led to their separation, they said.
   Last year, Terry O'Kelley, now 22, relinquished custody of his
four younger brothers, saying tensions between the siblings made it
impossible for him to continue as a single parent.
   The film stars actor Rick Schroder as Terry, who was at his
mother's deathbed when she asked him to keep the boys together.

   Farmers are closing out ``one of the best
years ever'' but will be subject to pivotal decisions in 1990 by
Congress and international trade negotiators, Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter said Thursday.
   Yeutter said 1989 income reached near-record levels,
agricultural exports have improved and the farm-credit situation
has eased for both lenders and borrowers.
   ``Net farm income will be either at or near a record for 1989,''
he said. ``The numbers are not fully determined yet, but certainly
it's been a very good year for American agriculture, one of the
best ever.''
   Most questions at Yeutter's year-end news conference related to
the Uruguay Round trade negotations under the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, or GATT. Those talks are scheduled to conclude a
year from now.
   Yeutter was asked if he thought there would be a freer
international market by 1999, one of the goals sought by U.S.
negotiators, particularly for agricultural products.
   ``My personal assessment is that we have the best chance for
significant trade liberalization in agriculture that we've
experienced since the GATT began'' 40 years ago, he replied.
   ``I do believe it'll be a freer market 10 years from now than it
is today, and I also believe firmly that that will work to the
advantage of the American farmer.''
   Other questions related to legislation being drafted by Congress
to succeed the 1985 farm law that expires next year. Yeutter said
teams of Agriculture Department experts are working on plans for
the 1990 farm bill but did not divulge details.
   The United States at the GATT talks has sought a gradual
reduction and eventual elimination of all trade-distorting
subsidies and policies. But administration officials have adamantly
insisted that no U.S. programs would be scrapped unless other
countries did likewise.
   ``Though we may want to make some changes in all of these
programs in the 1990 farm bill because those may be desirable in
their own right ... we're not going to unilaterally disarm
internationally in that legislation,'' Yeutter said.
   ``So, whether we're talking about sugar, the wheat program or
any other program, I determined that we not forgo any of our
negotiating leverage in that 1990 legislative debate,'' he said.
``But at the same time, I am not prepared to accept the arguments
of any individual industry to the effect that says all changes in
the program are off-limits.''
   Yeutter, who joined President Bush's cabinet in January, was
U.S. trade representative in the Reagan administration and has been
in the thick of Uruguay round negotiations since they began Sept.
20, 1986, in Punta del Esta, Uruguay.
   ``I'm always an optimist, as you know,'' he said about the final
push during talks in 1990. ``But, certainly, I do not underestimate
the negotiating challenge. It will be significant indeed.''
   Yeutter said it would require ``an immense amount of effort and
a strong political commitment'' on the part of the United States,
the European Economic Community, Japan, the developing countries
and others to bring the GATT talks to a close a year from now.
   The private sector, including farm groups, also will be
important in reaching U.S. objectives during the negotiations, he
said.
   ``They can disagree about tactics ... or they can disagree about
particular nuances of the program,'' Yeutter said. ``But it's
important that we have broad support for our fundamental
objectives.''

   This hard-luck town was destroyed by fire
in 1895, bypassed by the freeway in the late 1960s, flooded in the
'70s and dumped on by Mount St. Helens at the beginning of this
decade.
   But a state centennial project that transformed a vacant lot
into a plaza celebrating the town's heritage has earned some
residents national recognition.
   Eleven members of the Sprague-Lamont Camp Fire group and four
leaders went to Washington, D.C., this month to receive a
second-place award in the national Keep America Beautiful contest.
   The beautification project began last year when Camp Fire group
leader Rae Anna Victor decided Sprague needed something to stir the
community out of its doldrums and shake its downtrodden image. She
decided to start with a vacant lot covered with weeds, broken glass
and litter.
   The 35 boys and girls in the Camp Fire group were joined by
volunteers in raising $20,000 for the project through bake sales,
spaghetti feeds, raffles, turkey bingo and other fund-raisers.
   The lot was cleared and materials were donated to turn it into
the Sprague Centennial Plaza, complete with gazebo, trees and
grass. A 100-foot mural of 270 painted tiles tells the history of
the town, 35 miles southwest of Spokane.
   ``I get weepy when I even talk about it,'' said Gladys Engles,
80. ``There's more spirit and more Christmas lights in Sprague this
year than ever.''
   ``People used to come out of the drugstore and throw stuff into
the lot and it made the town look small and ugly,'' 11-year-old
Heather Wilken said. ``Now the plaza's made a lot of people stop
and see this town of ours.''

   Beckner is one of a few Postal Service employees who will
deliver packages this weekend dressed as Santa Claus. The Santa

   ``I'll take my time, do a little ho-ho with them and ask the

   Joe Stultz, superintendent at the Huntington Post Office, said

<TEXT>
   In a shantytown named Brooklyn and in
a half- dozen other slums, hundreds of people set up shop on the
sidewalks Thursday with merchandise looted from the rich stores.
   They were hawking everything _ from designer brassieres to
French champagne and Gucci watches _ all at bargain-basement prices.
   The alleys of the slum called Brooklyn were crowded with buyers
and sellers, haggling and bargaining, while the wealthy stores on
Avenida Espana, Panama City's main thoroughfare, were stripped bare.
   All day Wednesday, while fighting raged between U.S. troops and
Defense Forces loyal to strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, mobs
out of the dirt-poor barrios invaded Calidonia, Avenida Central,
Transistmica, Supercentros, Almanecenes and other stores.
   They carried off everything, from TVs and stereos, to cellular
phones, mattresses and even huge refrigerators and washing
machines, from clothes to desingner shoes and Barbie dolls.
   Some even set up shop in the doorways of their wooden shacks.
   Many people deplored the massive robbery and said they were
ashamed of it, but for a neighborhood such as Brooklyn it appeared
to be a Christmas boon. Virtually all the residents are without
work.
   They lost their jobs when the U.S. imposed a trade embargo last
year, one of a series of Bush administration measures to pressure
Noriega out of power, plunging Panama into a severe economic crisis.
   ``He doesn't have any running shoes for me, but I ordered a pair
for tomorrow,'' a buyer, about 50 years old, explained to a
visiting reporter, pointing to one of the stall vendors.
   ``It'll be only $5,'' another vendor nearby said as he draped a
girl's dress over his arm, trying to convince a prospective client.
   ``Too expensive,'' said the client, a housewife. They started
haggling. She, like almost all Panamanians these days, did not want
to give their names.
   One small house was filled with women buyers. The owner was
selling designer brassieres at $2 apiece. The buyers rummaged
through boxes full of them, looking for their sizes.
   At another ``store,'' men jostled each other, trying to buy some
of the best brand shaving lotions and perfumes, at a fraction of
the regular price.
   ``Look,'' a young man said, proudly showing a visiting reporter
a gold watch. ``I bought it for $20, the salesman didn't even
realize it is a Gucci.''
   A middle-aged matron doing her Christmas shopping was all
smiles. ``I bought it for $8,'' she said, pointing to an imported
turkey that costs at least $40 in regular stores.
   But another woman about her age, looking down at the scene from
a nearby balcony, shook her head in dismany. ``It makes feel like
sitting down and crying,'' she said sadly as a couple of handcarts
were dragged down the street full of looted merchandise.
   One of the carts even had pieces of furniture.
   ``This is horrible. I prefer to continue being poor. I just
don't like this,'' said another woman in Los Libertadores, another
shanty neighborhood.
   A little girl of about eight ran by, carrying three boxes full
of clothes for a Barbie doll her brother had given her as a present.
   ``I'm scared. I'm trembling. I couldn't keep my son from going
out to look,'' said one man.

   The measles explosion of 1989, involving
unvaccinated preschoolers and schoolchildren whose shots didn't
work, has been accompanied by the most measles deaths in 18 years,
federal health officials said Thursday.
   Forty-two deaths from measles have been reported this year, said
national Centers for Disease Control measles specialist Dr. William
L. Atkinson. That's the largest death count since 90 in 1971, he
noted.
   Nationwide, 14,714 measles cases were counted with two weeks
left in the year, the CDC said in its weekly report. That's more
than five times the 2,876 cases reported at this point a year ago.
   An analysis of measles cases in the first six months of this
year shows 30 percent occurred in children under 5, who are too
young to fall under school-vaccination laws. Fifty-one percent
occurred among young people 5-19.
   In the wake of the new measles explosion, CDC researchers have
recommended this year that children get vaccinated twice _ the
initial dose at 15 months in most areas, then again at school
entry, ages 4-6.
   In the first half of this year, 51 percent of measles cases
occurred among people who were believed ``appropriately
vaccinated,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said.
   The unvaccinated preschoolers present a separate problem,
Atkinson noted.
   ``We've got to find some sort of clever ways to motivate parents
to get their kids vaccinated,'' he said. ``A 15-month-old doesn't
walk in on his own.''
   Large measles outbreaks are continuing in Los Angeles, Chicago
and Houston, primarily among young blacks and Hispanics, the CDC
noted. Vaccination rates in some inner cities are as low as 49
percent in 2-year-olds, the agency said.
   Federal health officials believed measles eradication was within
reach early in this decade; just 1,497 cases were reported in 1983.
But the disease has bounced back, although still nowhere near the
pre-vaccine levels of half a million cases a year.
   During 1971, when 90 patients died, 75,290 cases were reported.

<HEAD>Budget Deficit Increases in November</HEAD>

   The federal budget deficit increased $28.96
billion in November, raising the imbalance during the first two
months of the fiscal year to more than half the ceiling for the
entire year, the Treasury Department said Thursday.
   Combined with the October deficit of $26.09 billion, the
imbalance totaled $55.05 billion. The Gramm-Rudman deficit
reduction law sets a $100 billion ceiling for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1.
   While the deficit is growing at a slower rate than during the
last fiscal year, it will have to slow substantially in subsequent
months to meet the Gramm-Rudman limit.
   The November deficit was 11 percent more than that posted in
October, but 0.6 percent less than the $29.13 billion November
imbalance a year ago.
   The deficit for the first two months of fiscal 1990 was 1.9
percent less than the $56.14 billion recorded in October-November
of fiscal 1989.
   The deficit for fiscal 1989 totaled $152.1 billion.
   President Bush on Tuesday signed a deficit reduction bill that
would trim spending by $14.7 billion, with a goal of reducing this
year's deficit to about $103 billion, according to supporters of
the measure.
   However, private economists said that estimate was based on
optimistic assumptions and that the actual deficit for the current
budget year is likely to be well above that figure.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the deficit actually
will be $128 billion despite the bill signed Tuesday.
   Revenue last month totaled $71.21 billion, 10.7 percent above
the same month of 1989, while spending rose 7.2 percent to $100.17
billion. The deficit is the difference between revenue and spending.
   As usual, the biggest spending categories were for the military,
Social Security and other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services, and interest on the national debt.
   Military spending totaled $24.57 billion in November and $43.74
billion so far this year. It is projected to total $286.89 billion
for the entire fiscal year.
   Social Security payments amounted to $19.75 billion last month
and $39.61 billion so far this year. It is projected to total
$242.95 billion for the year.
   Other HHS programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, totaled
$14.28 billion in November and $27.63 billion so far this year and
are projected to total $190.17 billion for the year.
   Interest on the national debt amounted to $20.20 billion in
November and $36.66 billion so far this year, and is projected to
total $254.36 billion for the year.

<HEAD>Refusenik Cases to be Resolved, American Jewish Leaders Told</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Foreign Ministry officials Thursday told American
Jewish leaders at the first national congress of Soviet Jews in
nearly 70 years that most of the estimated 100 remaining refuseniks
will be allowed to emigrate.
   Martin Wenick, executive director of the U.S. organization
National Conference on Soviet Jewry, said the news about the
refuseniks _ those Jews repeatedly refused permission to emigrate _
came from Anatoly Adamishin, a deputy foreign minister.
   Adamishin told Wenick and other representatives of the U.S.
group a ``substantial'' number of the refuseniks who had been
barred from emigrating because of access to state secrets would be
told soon they could leave.
   A Western diplomat who follows the refusenik issue said he had
heard the same report but cautioned that the Soviets had not
officially notified the refuseniks of the news. ``We hope it's true
but let's wait and see,'' said the diplomat.
   Emigration of Soviet Jews has reached record levels under
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's liberalized policies. An all-time
high of 55,465 Soviet Jews were registered at a transit center in
Vienna between January and November. More Jews left via Romania and
Hungary.
   Refuseniks remain, however, and problems of emigration have been
a central topic at the conference of Soviet Jews that began Monday
and ends Friday.
   A draft resolution to be voted on Friday welcomes progress made
so far in emigration but says the number of refuseniks has remained
stable at about 250 families, 100 of them refused on secrecy
grounds. The resolution also criticizes a draft law on emigration
and travel as overly vague and says it contains ``infringements on
the political, economic and social rights of citizens.''
   The meeting was organized by more than 160 Jewish organizations
in 75 cities and marked the first time since 1920 that Jewish
leaders were allowed to openly congregate to establish a national
organization.
   The country's biggest Jewish group, the Jewish Bund, was founded
by Jewish socialists in 1897 but disbanded in 1920.
   Former refuseniks now living abroad, deputies from the Soviet
parliament, and about 150 Jewish leaders from the West were among
the 650 people attending the conference.
   But Soviet officials denied a visa to Jewish activist Natan
Sharansky, who spent nine years in Soviet labor camps before
emigrating to Israel in 1986.
   The conference also was scheduled to adopt a resolution saying
anti-Semitism is growing in the Soviet Union, and delegates
expressed concern about two protest groups that have been
demonstrating outside the Cinema Center.
   As the conference opened, about 60 jeering members of the
Russian nationalist Pamyat Society jostled delegates as they tried
to enter the hall.
   They waved signs saying, ``Zionists Out of the U.S.S.R.'' and
``Jews, Get Out of the Union.''
   On Thursday, several dozen Palestinian students demonstrators
marched outside. They carried a picture of Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat and signs that read, ``P.L.O.
Israel No'' and ``Zionism Won't Go Through.''

   The Communist Party on Thursday
suspended former President Gustav Husak and 31 other former party
leaders pending an investigation into abuse of power.
   In their effort to clean up the party's image and prepare it for
free elections next year, delegates to a party congress also:
   _ Elected a new, steamlined policy-making Central Committee.
   _ Voted to disband a hated paramilitary militia used to crush
dissent.
   _ Adopted a new ``action program'' urging a break with the
Stalinist past.
   _ Expelled the man considered most responsible for the 1968
Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed reforms.
   Husak and the other party leaders were suspended for ``serious
political mistakes'' that will be investigated by a special
commission set up by the new Central Committee.
   Former Communist Premier Lubomir Strougal also was on the list,
which party spokesman Josef Hora said could be expanded.
   Results of the investigation, which could lead to expulsion from
party ranks, are to be delivered at a regular party congress in
May. Altogether, 32 officials will be investigated, Hora told
reporters on the final day of the congress.
   Husak and other hard-liners installed after the 1968 crackdown
have all been driven from power in a popular revolution that ended
the Communist Party's 41-year monopoly on power and led to a
government dominated by non-Communists.
   Former ideology chief Vasil Bilak was expelled Thursday ``as a
representative of forces who initiated the invasion'' of 1968.
   He is viewed by many Czechoslovaks as the man most responsible
for the Soviet-led invasion, which was recently denounced by
Czechoslovakia and by the five Warsaw Pact nations that
participated.
   He stepped down from the ruling Politburo last year and from the
presidium of Czechoslovakia's Parliament Dec. 12.
   The names of the new Central Committee members were not
released. Hora said the new body contains mostly new faces and was
cut to 138 members from its previous 156 members.
   The new ``action program'' calls for the rapid elimination of
the ``Stalinist model of the party and society.''
   ``What we are pursuing is the transformation of the Communist
party into a modern political party which will become party of the
democratic movement of the European left,'' it said.
   The day's session began with delegates voting to disband
immediately the despised paramilitary People's Militia.
   The uniformed militia, which had been under the direct control
of the party, was disarmed Dec. 3 and its weapons stored in army
warehouses.
   The last time it was used was in January, assisting riot polcie
to suppress demonstrations in Prague. Disbanding the militia was
among the earliest demands made by the pro-democracy movement.
   The party began purging undesirable members in late November,
ousting hard-line party leader Milos Jakes and then Prague party
boss Milos Stepan.
   Jakes was replaced by Karel Urbanek, who held the post less than
four weeks before losing it Wednesday.
   Former Premier Ladislav Adamec was elected party chairman and
Politburo member Vasil Mohorita was chosen first secretary. The two
new positions share the powers once wielded by the all-powerful
secretary-general.
   Adamec initiated the first talks in November with the
opposition, and Mohorita played a part in the talks.

   President Bush said today 11 people said to
have been abducted by Panamanian troops from a Smithsonian research
facility are free, though officials said the group is still waiting
to be picked up by American forces.
   Bush, speaking at a news conference, said the Smithsonian people
``have now been released.'' He said, however, he had no idea how
many other Americans were being held hostage in the Central
American country.
   Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the Smithsonian, confirmed Bush's
statement, but said the group is still at an undisclosed location.
   ``As far as we know they are not being held by anyone,'' he
said. ``They are waiting to be picked up,'' he added.
   The 11, all scientists and technicians associated with the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, were abducted by
armed troops Wednesday after the U.S. invasion of the country.
   The group _ five Americans, five Panamanians and one Venezuelan
_ was on the Sanblas chain of islands off the Panamanian coast.
They were performing marine research on the coral reef.
   Madelaine Jacobs, a Smithsonian spokeswoman, had earlier refused
to identify members of the group. But she said only one American
worked for the Smithsonian. The others were affiliated with
universities or research operations.
   Members of the group had access to a radio that enabled them to
contact Smithsonian employee and the headquarters at Panama City,
the tropical institute has several other stations throughout the
isthmus. Most of the staff members, 120 of whom work full time, are
Americans and Panamanians.

   Soldiers' families across the United States hoped for the best,
but some got the unwanted word: Their loved ones were among the
first fatalities from what the White House called Operation Just
Cause.
   The Pentagon today reported 19 U.S. servicemen killed, 117
wounded and one missing in the attack on Panama.
   In all, President Bush ordered 9,500 soldiers and Marines into
Panama to bolster the 13,000 normally based there.
   The remains of four soliders arrived this afternoon at Dover Air
Force Base, Del., from Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, where
the wounded from the invasion were taken en route to military
hospitals.
   The bodies in flag-draped caskets were taken off a C-141
Starlifter which landed shortly after 3 p.m. EST. The Delaware base
is the site of the Department of Defense's East Coast Port Mortuary.
   The body of Lt. j.g. John Patrick Connors, 25, of Arlington,
Mass., was among the four flown to Dover. Connors, a member of the
Navy's special operations unit known as the SEALS, was described as
``fearless,'' by his resident adviser at Worcester Polytechnic
Institute, where Connors received a bachelor's in chemical
engineering.
   ``I would come back in the middle of the night from studying and
he'd be hanging from the sprinkler pipes going hand over hand,''
said Walter Towner Jr.
   Also among those killed was 22-year-old Cpl. Ivan D. Perez, who
according to his sister, always wanted to be a soldier and passed
up a chance to get out of the service last year.
   ``He wanted to keep going,'' said his 24-year-old sister,
Andriana. ``We told him to get out. ... He just really enjoyed
being there. Ever since he was a little kid, he wanted to be a
soldier.''
   The Pawtucket, R.I., family sent him several Christmas cards,
including one the day before the invasion.
   Ten-year-old Miguel, who idolized his big brother, contributed
to the last card. ``He drew little soldiers and tanks on the
Christmas card,'' his sister said.
   A soldier from Cincinnati _ James Markwell, a 21-year-old medic
_ also was identified by his family as being among those killed.
   ``This was his first mission,'' said his stepfather, Bill Rouse.
``And I'll bet you he was patching somebody up when he got hit.''
   In Leesville, La., residents kept an eye on the television,
watching for word on their family members and friends from nearby
Fort Polk who were participating in the action against Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Mary Oliver, the 14-year-old daughter of an Army sergeant in
Panama, spent the day relaying news reports to her mother at work.
   Mary, who tried to explain the situation to her 10-year-old
brother about their father, Sgt. Frank Oliver, said: ``My brother,
I don't think he understands. I just keep telling him it must be
good, because we haven't heard anything bad.''
   Teresa O'Dell, the instructor at a beauty school where several
Army wives are in training, said there were a lot of tears when two
of her students received calls Wednesday that their husbands were
being shipped out to Panama.
   ``Several of them left here to tell their husbands goodbye,''
O'Dell said.
   Such rushed, tearful departures also played out in the Spring
Lake, N.C., area, a cluster of strip shopping centers, fast-food
outlets and trailer parks adjacent to Fort Bragg, home of the
Army's 82nd Airborne Division.
   Sgt. Timothy W. Bolton rushed into his North Carolina home,
tossed a few things into a gripsack and turned to his wife, Treva.
   ``I've got to go,'' he told her. ``I love you. 'Bye.''
   A kiss, an embrace, then he was gone, headed back to Fort Bragg,
where he boarded a military plane headed to Panama.
   ``It was quick, but I was one of the lucky ones,'' said Mrs.
Bolton, 22. ``I was fortunate he didn't have his bags (on base). If
he'd had them with him, I wouldn't have gotten a chance to say
goodbye.''
   Since her husband's departure, anchormen have become her
companions.
   While she worked at a laundry in a shopping center, she
frequently turned to the television to see what new developments
were being reported.
   At Fort Polk, sentries stood guard outside the La Louisiane
Recreation Center, where family members received word of the
operation.
   Inside, Army spokesmen said, the mood calmed after the initial
announcement Wednesday morning of the move against Noriega.
   Several women left the center in the afternoon smiling, their
children in tow with coloring books in their hands. Army officials
didn't allow interviews on the base.
   ``It's just really high tension now, especially at Christmas
time,'' said the Rev. Dennis Hackler, pastor of Cooper Baptist
Church. ``They're worried; if things do escalate down there,
there'll probably be a lot of people shipped out. It's just kind of
a waiting game.''

   Roving bands of Noriega loyalists
``getting their last licks in'' shot from the rooftops, and the
U.S. ambassador predicted life in Panama will continue to be
dangerous for some time.
   A continuing firefight prevented a helicopter from dropping off
a small U.S. media contingent at Patilla Airport. The chopper
touched down briefly but was waved off.
   Reporters saw American soldiers pressed behind concrete walls
and running between buildings near the control tower. Officials
said there were snipers on rooftops in the area.
   Military officials of the Southern Command confirmed that a
journalist had been killed near the Marriott Hotel, but could not
say immediately who it was.
   However, Spanish ambassador Tomas Lozano said Juan Antonio
Rodriquez, a photographer for Spain's largest newspaper, El Pais,
was killed Thursday during a cross fire between U.S. troops in the
hotel parking lot.
   Troops from the 82nd Airborne Division freed 29 U.S. citizens
and 35 foreign nationals from the Marriott, where they had been
trapped for 36 hours since the military operation began early
Wednesday, military officials said.
   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, back in Panama after a seven-month
absence, predicted there would be retaliation from troops loyal to
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who was ousted by U.S. forces.
   ``I think this is a very difficult time for security because of
retaliation,'' Davis said.
   The ambassador left Panama in May, the day after Noriega voided
elections observers said he lost. Davis said he was bringing an
economic recovery proposal to Panama's new leaders, including the
$700 million in assets freed by President's Bush's decision to lift
economic sanctions.
   The sporadic gunfire in Panama was attributed by U.S. military
officials to roving bands of Noriega loyalists ``getting their last
licks in,'' rather than to fighting between Noriega forces and
American troops.
   Panamanian civilian leaders had wanted Panamanian forces, not
those from the United States, to oust Noriega. But John Bushnell,
the U.S. charge d'affaires, said that after a failed coup Oct. 3,
``there was a feeling that, well, there weren't many more
Panamanians left with guns that might do it, so it was becoming a
hopeless situation.''
   ``They never said it so many words, `We wish you would really
send the 82nd Airborne to do it,' but they clearly indicated their
frustration that if we didn't, the situation was just going to go
on and get worse,'' Bushnell said.
   The new leaders' main concern, he said, was that if Noriega were
shot, another Panamanian Defense Force colonel might take his place.
   Indeed, it was by pretending that Noriega had been killed, U.S.
soldiers bluffed Panamanian soldiers into freeing two American
women held hostage more than six hours in an airport terminal.
   Mary Rebhan, 24, of Hollywood, Fla., and Tara King, 25, of
Dallas, told reporters they were used as shields by 30 armed
Noriega loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customs room at Omar
Torrijos International Airport when American forces moved in.
   The two women had gone to the airport Tuesday evening to pick up
Rebhan's brother, flying in for her wedding at the end of the month.
   ``They had us in choke holds for most of the time,'' Rebhan said.
   ``They made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to her
head,'' King said.
   American troops began to arrive in force to take over the
airport, but the Panamanians held them off with the women.
   ``For six hours they made us keep shouting, `Go away. We're
Americans. They're going to kill us and the children if you
come,''' Rebhan said.
   Just before dawn, the Americans set a deadline of 6:30 a.m. for
the men to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that
Noriega was already dead. In fact, Noriega's whereabouts was not
known.
   The Panamanians gave up, leaving the room with the women held in
front of them.

   Here is the transcript of President Bush's
news conference Thursday afternoon.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: I have a brief statement, to be followed by a
brief press conference because I have a pain in the neck.
(Laughter.) Seriously.
   Q: Why?
   PRESIDENT BUSH: That's your first question?
   Q: No. (Laughter.)
   PRESIDENT BUSH: Okay. I'll go ahead. Well, our efforts to
support the democratic processes in Panama and to ensure continued
safety of American citizens is now moving into its second day. I'm
gratified by the decision and effect of the precision and the
effectiveness of the military forces in achieving their objectives.
I'm pleased that the Endara government is taking charge, and they
made several appointments today _ starting to govern the country.
   The young men and women involved in the exercise have
demonstrated the highest standards of courage and excellence in
defending America's interest and protecting American life. They
have been outstanding. In carrying out the mission of our nation,
there has been and they have sustained a tragic loss of life.
Military casualties are a burden which a nation must endure and all
presidents have to face up to, but which we can never accept. And
maybe it's just this time of year, but I don't think so. But
particularly _ just a second _ particularly at this time of year,
my heart goes out to the families of those who have died in Panama,
those who have been wounded.
   This operation is not over, but it's pretty well wrapped up. And
we've moved aggressively to neutralize the PDF (Panamanian Defense
Forces), to provide a stable environment for the freely elected
Endara government _ and I mentioned that. It helps to ensure the
integrity of the Panama Canal and to create an environment that is
safe for American citizens.
   Gen. Noriega is no longer in power. He no longer commands the
instruments of government or the forces of repression that he's
used for so long to brutalize the Panamanian people. And we are
continuing the efforts to apprehend him, see that he's brought to
justice.
   I appreciate the support that we've received, strong support
from the United States Congress, from our Latin American neighbors,
from our allies, from the American people. And it's always
difficult to order forces into battle, but that difficulty is
mitigated by the moral and personal support that is granted by our
friends and allies.
   You've received detailed briefings from the Pentagon on the
logistical aspects, and I might say that I think (Secretary of
Defense) Dick Cheney and (Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Gen.) Colin Powell have done _ and ably assisted by others _ have
done an outstanding job of keeping the American people informed.
   I wanted you to know that as we move into the days ahead, we
will continue to support the Endara government, to help establish
stability in the country, to allow those desires for freedom and
democracy to flourish.
   And I'll be glad to take some questions.

<HEAD>Government Study Shows Failure of Bone Marrow Transplants in AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 26 American AIDS patients have been
given bone marrow transplants as a possible cure, but at least 10
have died and the rest have shown only temporary improvement,
researchers say.
   Interest in these apparent failures was sparked by a report from
Johns Hopkins University that a bone marrow transplant combined
with the anti-AIDS drug AZT might have eliminated the AIDS virus
from one patient. The patient died before the researchers could be
certain the virus was gone.
   The Hopkins case was widely reported in June when it was
announced at an international AIDS meeting in Montreal. The case
received renewed attention this week when it was described in The
New York Times.
   On Wednesday, Dr. Clifford Lane of the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases said his study of 16 patients
produced ``16 failures.'' He found ``only transient improvement in
immunity'' in patients getting AZT and bone marrow transplants.
   Lane's study used identical twins, so that a perfect bone marrow
match could be obtained for each patient from his twin. The Hopkins
study did not use twins, and so it was necessary to destroy, or
``ablate,'' the patient's immune system with chemotherapy and
radiation before the transplant.
   Lane said at least 10 other U.S. AIDS patients had received
transplants after their immune systems were ablated, with
exceedingly poor results.
   ``Every case I know of where the recipient was ablated, the
recipient died,'' Lane said. That includes the Hopkins patient.
   ``There are lots of us who haven't published our results because
they've been so dismal,'' said Dr. Ronald Mitsuyasu of the
University of California, Los Angeles, who has handled four such
cases. ``All we can say is that it's an interesting concept and
that additional patients will need to be studied.''
   Bone marrow transplantation, used most commonly to treat rare
genetic immune disorders and certain forms of cancer, is risky and
expensive. The cost averages about $125,000, and 35 percent to 40
percent of recipients over age 35 die from the procedure, said Dr.
Richard O'Reilly, chief of bone marrow transplantation at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The mortality rate drops
below 15 percent in children, he said.
   It is unlikely, therefore, that the technique could be used on a
large scale to treat patients, some researchers said. ``You have to
be young, you have to be rich, and you have to be willing to risk a
one-in-four chance that the cure will kill you,'' said Dr. Mark
Jacobson, an AIDS specialist at the University of California, San
Francisco.
   In Lane's study, done in collaboration with Dr. Anthony Fauci,
director of the allergy institute, AZT did not prevent the virus
from infecting transplanted bone marrow, as the researchers had
hoped it might. Planned studies using different AIDS drugs might be
more successful, Lane said.
   The Hopkins team, led by Dr. Rein Saral, used drugs and
radiation to wipe out the immune system of a 41-year-old AIDS
patient with lymphoma, a form of cancer. They then gave him AZT and
a bone marrow transplant. Thirty-five days later, they used a
sensitive test called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, to search
for the AIDS virus in his body. They found no evidence of it.
   The patient died of the lymphoma 47 days after the transplant.
Tests again failed to show the virus in his blood or in various
tissue samples, but researchers couldn't be sure the virus was
eliminated.
   ``The virus could be there but in such small numbers that we
couldn't detect it,'' said Dr. H. Kent Holland, a member of the
Hopkins team. ``It's possible there was no virus. ... That's all we
can say.''

<HEAD>WASHN: some questions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, one of your major objectives was to get
Noriega. Are you frustrated that he got away? How long will you
keep on chasing him? And are you confident that you'll get him?
   A: I've been frustrated that he's been in power this long _
extraordinarily frustrated. The good news: He's out of power. The
bad news: He has not yet been brought to justice. So I'd have to
say, Terry, there is a certain level of frustration on that
account. The good news, though, is that the government's beginning
to function, and the man controls no forces, and he's out. But,
yes, I won't be satisfied until we see him come to justice.
   Q: How long will you keep up your full-scale pursuit?
   A: As long as it takes.
   Q: Mr. President, you did mention the casualties. Did you expect
them to be so high on both sides? I mean _
   A: We had some very _
   Q: And also was _ it it really worth it to send people to their
death for this? To get Noriega?
   A: We had some estimates, Helen, on the casualties ahead of
time, but not in numbers. I mean, it was more general; that,
``Look, Mr. President, no way can you do an operation this large
and not have American casualties.'' So the Defense Department was
very up front with us about that. And every human life is precious,
and yet I have to answer, yes, it has been worth it.
   David?
   Q: Mr. President _
   A: No. David, Brit, and Wyatt, and John.
   Q: A few months ago, you said your complaint was not with the
PDF, not with the Panamanian people, but with Noriega only. You
also said only a month ago that you didn't think it would be
prudent to launch a large-scale military operation. What changed
your mind, and particularly why did you opt for the maximum use of
force in this situation?
   A: I think what changed my mind was the events that I cited in
briefing the American people on this yesterday: the death of the
Marine, the brutalizing, really obscene torture of the Navy
lieutenant, and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror inflicted
on that Navy lieutenant's wife, the declaration of war by Noriega,
the fact that our people down there felt that they didn't know
where this was going and they weren't sure what all that meant and
whether that meant we could guarantee the safety of Americans there.
   And so I made a decision to move and to move with enough force _
this was the recommendation of the Pentagon _ to be sure that we
minimized the loss of life on both sides and that we took out the
PDF, which we did, took it out promptly. And so I would like to
think that what I said some time ago still stands.
   I'm not sure what's left on the ground in terms of people, but
what David Hoffman is referring to is that I said our argument was
not with the PDF, but with Noriega, and if they would get rid of
him and recognize a democratically elected government, we could go
back to more normalized relations. We've done that, but we have to
see who emerges in the PDF. But I would like to repeat here that we
have no continuing ax to grind with the institution of the PDF.
Endara's going to need loyal troops who recognize the constitution
and the fairness and the legitimacy of his election.

   Pony rides and petting zoos exploit
animals and must be banned from public property, the city
commission decided in a move praised by animal-rights activists.
   ``I think petting zoos are terrible,'' Vice Mayor Guy Roper said
before Wednesday's vote. ``While a lot of (children) have probably
gone and petted the cute little bunnies at a petting zoo ... little
children may not realize when they grab them, they might be
breaking an ear or putting a finger in the eye.''
   Animal rights activists and members of the Humane Society of
Broward County told commissioners the ordinance would prevent some
animal abuse.
   But some people feared the ban would deprive children from
learning about animals.
   ``Most of you have had your picture taken on a pony with a
cowboy hat on. Is that going to be against the law?'' asked Henry
Harbinson.
   Commissioners gave initial approval to the ordinance, but asked
city attorney Maria Chiaro to rewrite it to make it more specific.
As approved Wednesday, the law allows animal exhibits for
``educational purposes'' only.

   Newly revised income figures by the
Agriculture Department show that farmers haven't been making as
much money the last few years as agency economists had been
reporting.
   The Economic Research Service, the department's professional
agency that keeps the financial books on agriculture, on Wednesday
issued revised estimates reflecting higher expenses than had been
used in the earlier computations.
   ``It doesn't change what actually happened, of course,'' said
agency economist Greg Gajewski. ``It changes our perception ... but
I can't see that it changes the direction of anything.''
   One of the effects was to reduce the net cash income of farmers
_ the money left over after deducting cash expenses from gross cash
proceeds during the calendar year. It includes government payments
and proceeds from crops grown in earlier years.
   The revisions, based on 1987 figures from the federal census of
agriculture, showed that net cash income in 1987 was $54.5 billion
instead of the $57.7 billion reported as recently as a month ago.
   In 1988, according to the revisions, net cash income of farmers
rose to $57.2 billion _ not to the $59.9 billion stated previously.
   This year, according to the agency's new report, the net cash
income of farmers may be in the range of $52 billion to $57
billion. That is unchanged from the earlier forecast.
   Gajewski, who oversees preparation of the monthly report, said
that the 1987 census benchmark now being used showed that farm
expenses turn out about 3 percent higher than had been estimated
earlier.
   ``It suggests farmers did a little less well than we thought
they were doing,'' Gajewski said in a telephone interview.
   But he noted that despite the downward revisions, the new income
numbers for those years are still records and that ``the rebound
from the financial crisis is still very real.''
   The revised figures also prompted changes in another method of
farm accounting used by the agency. That involves ``net farm
income'' which measures the value of production, including federal
payments, in a specific year. Changes in the value of crop and
livestock inventories are part of the annual accounting.
   Under this method, net farm income in 1987 was $43.5 billion
instead of the $47.1 billion reported previously. In 1988, net farm
income was revised to $42.7 billion from $45.7 billion.
   This year's estimate was pegged at $48 billion instead of in a
range of $48 billion to $53 billion used a month ago.
   Gajewski said the revisions are ``part of the profession'' of
economics and are done regularly, year after year.
   ``When the government stops revising numbers, that's when you
have to start really worrying,'' he said. ``To some extent, it take
a lot of courage to go back and lower income numbers.''

   The Agriculture Department says China has
bought additional U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said Wednesday seven private
exporting companies made the deals for a total of 410,000 metric
tons under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for February and March, he
said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized under EEP on
Dec. 5. A previous allocation of 2 million tons made last Feb. 27
had been exhausted, except for 10,000 tons.
   With the latest EEP approvals, China has 600,000 tons remaining
to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 15 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at $3.85 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of around $58 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $19.26 per ton, or
about 52 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 125,000 tons;
Continental Grain Co., 80,000; Coprostates Inc., 50,000; Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 40,000; Peavy Co., 40,000; Tradigrain Inc., 40,000;
and Mitsubishi International Corp., 35,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 5.1 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
on June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China bought
more than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the EEP
program.

<HEAD>Cabinet Will Have Whites, Businessmen, Opposition Parties</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sam Nujoma, expected to be Namibia's
first president, on Thursday named a white, a businessman and
opposition party members to a Cabinet that will take power when the
territory becomes independent next year.
   The announcement was seen as the latest move by Nujoma and his
South-West Africa People's Organization to bring about
reconciliation in the territory wracked by 23 years of war against
South African rule.
   Leftist SWAPO captured last month's U.N.-supervised elections.
The seven parties represented in the constituent assembly reached
tentative agreement Wednesday on a constitution, and independence
is likely to be declared in March, according to most observers.
   Nujoma named 14 of the 16 Cabinet posts, but did not fill the
agriculture or wildlife ministries. Nujoma, a virtual certainty to
become president, also left the prime minister's post open for the
time being.
   The most prominent jobs all went to leading SWAPO members.
   But Nujoma also named Reinhold Rukoro of the Namibia National
Front as deputy minister of justice and Reggie Diergaardt of the
United Democratic Front as deputy minister for trade and industry.
   Also, a white accountant with no party affiliation, Gert
Hanekom, was named auditor general. Zed Ngavirue, chairman of a
private mining company, will head the National Planning Commission.
   Leftist SWAPO holds 41 of the 72 seats in the assembly. The
Democratic Turnhalle Alliance, a multiracial coalition that favors
a capitalist economy, has 21 seats. The remaining 10 seats are
divided among five other parties.
   The draft constitution has a declaration of fundamental rights,
including freedom of movement, speech and a free press. It also
envisions a multiparty democracy, regular elections for two houses
of Parliament, an executive president and an independent judiciary.
   SWAPO waged a bush war against South African rule of the
territory from 1966 until April of this year.
   South Africa, which captured Namibia from Germany in 1915, will
continue to administer the territory until independence. However,
it has withdrawn all its troops.
   The more than 6,000 U.N. military and civilian personnel in
Namibia are scheduled to remain until the end of March.

   China on Thursday praised President Bush for
easing economic sanctions, saying the measures would help restore
normal relations.
   Bush's actions were ``positive steps helpful to the
normalization of relations between China and the United States,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua. ``We welcome this.''
   Bush this week exempted from economic sanctions the export of
three communications satellites to be launched by China and
sanctioned Export-Import Bank credit to companies doing business in
China.
   The relaxation of sanctions followed a Dec. 9-10 visit to
Beijing by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft that ended a
U.S. ban on high-level exchanges between the two sides.
   The Bush administration, which imposed the sanctions after the
bloody military attack on student-led pro-democracy demonstrators
this June, has been criticized for being too friendly to Beijing's
hard-line leaders.
   White House officials said the decision to allow China to launch
satellites for Australian and Hong Kong firms, and the waiving of
restrictions on low-interest Ex-Im Bank loans to Americans
investing in China, were in the ``national interest.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the sale of the
satellites will bring $300 million worth of business to U.S. firms.
   Jin declined comment on whether Bush's actions would help settle
other outstanding issues, particularly that of Fang Lizhi, the
outspoken dissident who has been hiding in the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing since June.
   Jin repeated the Chinese position that Fang's future is a
``sensitive question'' that must be solved through joint efforts of
the two sides.
   Jin also reread a Foreign Ministry statement issued earlier
condemning U.S. military action in Panama, saying it was
interference in the internal affairs of another country and a
violation of international law.
   On Saturday, a senior Soviet Communist Party official arrives
for a visit to include talks between the two largest Marxist
nations on the crisis in world communism.
   The crumbling of one-party Communist rule in Eastern Europe is
certain to be on the agenda during the weeklong visit of Valentin
Falin, head of the decision-making Central Committee's
International Department, a Soviet Embassy official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Chinese are unhappy with events in Eastern Europe and are eager to
sound out the Soviets on their approach to the popular groundswell
of opposition to Communist rule.
   The official said the Chinese have also expressed concern about
growing turmoil in Romania, East Europe's most stubborn holdout
against political reform and a staunch ally of China since its
military crackdown.
   On bilateral matters, Falin will discuss how to improve
party-to-party relations following the May visit of President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which ended a 30-year freeze in Sino-Soviet
party contacts.
   Falin has asked to meet party General Secretary Jiang Zemin, and
a favorable response from the Chinese would indicate their
willingness to move party relations to a higher plane, the official
said.
   The two sides may touch on a planned visit by Premier Li Peng to
Moscow, tentatively set for next April.
   The official said overall Sino-Soviet relations have generally
progressed well since the Gorbachev visit in spite of the June
turmoil in China and divergences in views on political reform.
   He said there were so many Soviet delegations visiting China
that the embassy could no longer handle them all. Trade along the
once-tense border is booming, and total bilateral trade is expected
to increase substantially from last year's $3.25 billion.
   The official China Daily said Thursday that the two countries
are now discussing cooperation in a $46 million project to build
China's first coal slurry pipeline.
   Soviet officials acknowledge, however, that China's top priority
is still obtaining Western technology, and China's strained
relations with the West will not result in a sharp increase in
Sino-Soviet economic exchanges.
   The Soviet Union, the official said, hopes better relations with
China will facilitate multinational development of Siberia's rich
natural resources, with Chinese laborers being brought in for
projects backed by Japanese, U.S. and South Korean technology and
financing.

<TEXT>
   Q: Mr. President, in light of what you've said about the Endara
government getting started, the need for stability, the need for
some kind of police action down there, we really are in a kind of
an open-ended military occupation there, aren't we, sir?
   A: Well, I wouldn't say it's open-ended, except it's open-ended
as far as going after Noriega _ open-ended in terms of the
restoration of order in Panama, cleaning up a few elements _
rag-tag elements of this so-called ``dignity battalion.'' If you
ever talk about a misnomer, that's it _ ``dignity battalion'' _
going after them. The PDF units have pretty _ been rolled up. But,
we will keep whatever force is necessary there until our military
are satisfied and recommend to the President that they be
withdrawn. I want them out of there as soon as possible.
   Q: Mr. President, just to follow up, if I could, sir. In he
planning of this operation, surely you must have recognized that
these actions would be needed and some force would have to be on
the ground there for awhile. What estimate did you have, as you
undertook this operation, as to how long it would take?
   A: Brit, no day _ number of day estimate was given to me. I
think everyone recognized some of that would depend on when Noriega
was brought to justice, some of that dependent on how a
restructured PDF behaved.
   Q: Mr. President, what do you know about Americans held against
their will, and what are you doing now to free them?
   A: I'm looking for help on that because we don't have a count.
And if there are a lot of them, we don't know about it. But, I just
had a briefing _ I don't know whether Cheney's still here.
   Q: Well, the Pentagon said, sir, there were 12 open cases.
   A: Well, I'll tell you, that included probably those Smithsonian
people who have now been released, and I think there may have been
9 or 10 of those. So _ but, I'd just have to get Marlin to get back
to you.
   Q: Well, does that indicate that that's not a priority in the
reporting to you _
   A: No. It indicates to me that it's very hard to know what's
going on when there's a firefight and a battle, because we heard
all kind of rumors. We had calls from your network _ your chairman
of the board _ urging us to go in and take the _ (some laughter) _
take the _ no, he did! And I understand it. He had a reporter that
he _ a producer that he felt was held. We've gone there. That place
is secure, I'm told. But, I don't know that we can tell him this
minute about that _ the life of that individual. But, we will keep
on going till we can tell him about the life of that individual.
   There's been an awful lot of interest in the Marriott Hotel.
But, I'm very pleased to say that it is secure. And we've had heads
of corporations, we've had news organizations other than his,
concerned about their people. And we must be as responsive as we
can.
   Yeah, John and then Charles.
   Q: We are hearing _ we're hearing that American _
   A: Then Ellen.
   Q: _ troops and tanks have surrounded the Cuban and Nicaraguan
embassies in Panama City, and that in Managua the Nicaraguans have
retaliated by surrounding our embassy there with their own tanks.
Are you hearing the same thing?
   A: We were told that is not true.
   Q: That is not true?
   A: Yeah. As of a briefing I just had.
   Charles?
   Q: Mr. President, you've referred to the elected government of
Mr. Endara. As you know, there was never an accurate final count
that confirmed that even though most polls suggested he had
probably won by a 3-to-1 margin. In talking with him _ or in the
future, have you encouraged _ or would you encourage him to seek
again elections that would verify that he, indeed, or whoever would
be a legally elected president?

   A: I would encourage as much as their constitution calls for.
But the election of Endara was, as you point out, so overwhelming,
the vote count so high, that I don't think anybody can suggest
somebody else might well have won that election.
   Q: But Mr. President, what I pointed out was that it was never
final and it was never verified. It was _
   A: Well, because it was aborted by this dictator Noriega,
``maximum leader'' _ so decreed three days ago, but he was acting
like maximum leader before that, thwarting, frustrating the will of
the Panamanian people. So, I think the international community that
oversaw those elections, including a former president of the United
States, felt that it went pretty well.
   Yeah, on the aisle.
   Q: Mr. President, if I can go back _
   A: Then Ellen.
   Q: _ to the question _
   A: Excuse me. You go ahead and then I got to go to Ellen.
   Q: If I can go back to the question of hostages, they say that
you anticipated Noriega might escape the initial assault, and so
there were plans to go after him. Where are your priorities, sir;
in getting Manuel Noriega or in dealing with the Americans who
might be held? Because if you get Noriega, the Americans may still
be held.
   A: And if we get Noriega, in quite a _ pretty much likelihood
they'll be released unless somebody wants to use a held American as
a ticket to get out of town. So we're doing both. We are
concentrating every way we possibly can to find Noriega, and that
is not drawing down _ here is my answer, it is not drawing down on
the assets that we have available to safeguard the lives of
Americans. They are not mutually exclusive.
   Ellen?
   Q: Sir, why is it that tens of thousands of American fighting
men, and with all of our intelligence, we are still _
   A: Ellen.
   Q: _ unable to catch one bad guy from Panama?
   A: Because intelligence is imperfect, Ellen.
   Q: And sir, did we _ did we make an effort _
   A: It's good, sometimes it's certain _ counting numbers, very
sure. Intention of a person to be someplace or move, very
difficult, but it's still sophisticated. I am convinced we've got
the best, but that's why, it is imperfect.
   Q: A follow-up, sir? Had you made an effort prior to the
invasion to go down and capture General Noreiga?
   A: Have I? No, I've been right here on the job (Scattered
laughter).
   Yeah?
   Q: Had the administration, sir? Had our people, had Americans
made an effort to do so?
   A: Have _ was there some operation, you mean? Not that I know of.
   Yeah, in the middle?
   Q: What was the _
   A: I was thinking of the lady next to you, but go ahead and then
we'll go again.
   Q: What led you to approve _
   A: You're next, you're next.
   Q: What led you to approve of the decision to have a bounty on
Noriega, and is this the type of thing that we will be doing in the
future?
   A: His picture will be in every post office in town, that's the
way it works, he is a fugitive drug dealer and we want to see him
brought to justice. And if that helps, if there is some incentive
for some Panamanian to turn him in, that's a very _ a million bucks
that I would be very happy to sign the check for.
   Yes?
   Q: Yeah, I was going to ask you about Panama and the Panamanians
who have suffered mightily as a result of all of this, not only
because of the sanctions that we have imposed for a long time, but
the military action, the homes destroyed, the lives lost, and so
forth. Are you willing to make now a major commitment in terms of
aid to Panama to help rebuild what has been destroyed down there?
   A: Yes, I am willing to help the Panamanian people. We have
already ordered the lifting of sanctions, we are _ I am convinced
that as we open up economic channels they'll do a much better, the
standard of living will increase for all as we go forward with
investment. We have permitted now the reflagging, or the _ stop,
put it this way _ don't have to unflag their Panamanian vessels,
and there are other things that we can do. We've released escrowed
funds. We are trying to help Mr. Endara already with, you know,
operating funds to pay the workers and the people. And beyond that,
though, I think your question goes _ I think we will feel obligated
to try to help in every way possible.
   Yeah?

<TEXT>
   A path of lanterns flickered against
a granite memorial Thursday as grieving relatives and local
residents marked the first anniversary of the Pan Am Flight 103
bombing over this Scottish town.
   The 270 lights _ one for each victim killed _ shone in the night
after local clergymen dedicated the memorial in a 19th century
graveyard during a day of somber and poignant commemoration.
   At least 20 American relatives joined in the services,
culminating in an open-air ecumenical gathering at night outside
the town hall that on Dec. 21, 1988, became a makeshift morgue.
   More than one-third of Lockerbie 3,500 people turned out in
freezing temperatures to hear the local Roman Catholic priest
declare, ``from this disaster there is no complete recovery.''
   ``The honest answer is that ... quite simply, life cannot be the
same again,'' said the Rev. Patrick Keegan. ``It has changed, we
have changed.''
   In the early evening, relatives _ some sobbing _ packed an
isolated stone church, Tundergarth, overlooking the field where the
cockpit fell from the jumbo jet. It was blown apart by terrorist
bomb in a radio cassette player.
   Earlier, about 500 people gathered in biting cold at a simple
dedication of the memorial in the Dryfesdale Cemetery, one mile
outside Lockerbie.
   ``While this might be a traumatic experience for us, the worst
has already happened,'' said George Williams of Joppa, Md. His only
child, a 24-year-old U.S. Army lieutenant, was on the flight.
   ``When we go home we'll feel a whole lot better,'' added
Williams, 58, who came with his wife, Judy.
   Vapor trailing from two aircraft overhead formed a cross in what
appeared to be a coincidental tribute.
   All 259 people aboard the New York-bound Pan Am jet died and 11
others died on the ground as the jet exploded over this small town
in southern Scotland.
   After a year of painstaking investigation, the bomber has not
been identified. But suspicion points to an extremist Middle East
terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   As darkness fell, an American couple, Paul and Eleanor Hudson,
lighted 270 lanterns along a path leading to the memorial and in a
circle before it. Their 16-year-old daughter, Melina, was aboard
the flight.
   Classmates at Melina's school, the Albany Academy for Girls, in
Albany, N.Y., made the lanterns, which were sand-filled bags with
candles inside. Each was inscribed with a dove and the name of a
victim.
   ``It's the greatest honor I can think of,'' said Mrs. Hudson,
from Albany.
   On the light polished granite of the 6-foot memorial, names of
the victims are carved in roughly alphabetical order, with families
grouped together, in three panels.
   ``When you actually see the names, that's when it really hits
you _ 270 is just a number,'' said Briton Barry Flick, whose
brother, Clayton, boarded Flight 103. Clayton Flick and his fiancee
had been going on a three-day sightseeing trip.
   Wreaths heaped at the foot of the memorial included one from
Syracuse University, to its 35 students who perished on Flight 103
as they flew home for Christmas from an exchange program.
   ``I thought it was very appropriate and very respectful ... an
extension of the people of Lockerbie. They've given us faith and
hope throughout the year,'' said Joe Horgan, of Philadelphia, a
member of the board of Victims of Pan Am Flight 103. It represents
American victims.
   British families of victims sent a 3-foot wreath of evergreen
sprigs and carnations carrying the inscription, ``Their spirit
lives on.''
   The Stars and Stripes, sodden from rain that stopped only as the
service in the cemetery began, drooped in front of the granite
memorial.
   No formal invitations were issued to what the local member of
Parliament, Sir Hector Monro, called ``a family affair.'' But the
U.S. ambassador, Henry Catto, attended and Queen Elizabeth II sent
a representative.
   In the heart of the garden is a grave containing a single casket
symbolizing the 17 victims whose bodies were never found, 10 from
the aircraft and seven from Lockerbie.
   At the back of the cemetery, a memorial plaque presented
Wednesday night by American relatives was attached to a rock wall
where other relatives can affix individual plaques.
   Earlier, Britain announced that following recommendations of a
security study, inspectors with inert explosives will begin posing
as terrorists to test airport security, following the practice of
Israel's El Al airline.

<TEXT>
   Q: Yes, Mr. President, what can you tell us about civilian
casualties, specifically Panamanian civilian casualties down there,
and was there any estimate given in the preplanning of this
invasion of civilian casualties?
   A: Our numbers are almost nonexistent, and I heard some reports
from a hospital, and we've not been able to confirm those numbers,
that some civilians were killed. And I just asked that of our
defense chief, who had the latest information when he came over
here. And so I just can't help you on the total numbers.
   Q: Well, then _ my _ the other question was, the second part,
was there an estimate in the preplanning of this invasion?
   A:I don't think an estimate of numbers, but a great concern
about that, and one of the reasons we went in with the force we
did, to take down the PDF and do it as quickly, was to minimize
civilian casualties. And the way we went after some of these
targets was to minimize civilian casualties. We _ a lot of kids
risked their lives going in at night. Parachuting in someplace at
night is not a piece of cake. And we _ some of that was to _ stay
away from the fact that civilians would be out and about in the
morning.
   Q: Mr. President, how do you rate the chances now that _
(laughter in response to off-mike comment) _ Noriega might be able
to manage some kind of a hit-and-run guerrilla operation from
hiding? What are the chances of that?
   A: I don't think so. The military doesn't seem to think that he
has the communications or a PDF-continued loyalty that would make
him go into the woods. I like the way Colin Powell put it: He
hasn't been in a jungle in a long time. And it's tough living, and
he's been living high off the hog, off the Panamanian people. And
so we don't expect kind of a Sierra Madre approach to this.
   Sarah, you've been very good and kind all year. This is my last
press conference here _
   Q: _ got a final question _
   A: _ and this is the second-to-last question. I hope it's a
gentle one.
   Q: What do you mean, your last press conference here, sir?
   A: Is that your question? Well, here is _ (laughter) _ here's
the thing. We've _ how many have we had this year?
   Q: No, but sir _
   STAFF: Thirty.
   A: We've had 30 press conferences this year, Helen, and some in
your midst here have come to me and said _ please Sarah, lighten
up, do not _ don't do this quite so much.
   Thank you very much.
   Q: This is a very mild question. Are you sending a letter today
to the Senate to coordinate with the War Powers Act? They have the _
   A: I don't know whether it goes today, but we will do what _
well, we're _ we will _ I think there's certain technical language
on this that _ but notification of the Congress will be done in
accordance with our policy.
   This is the last one.
   Q: Have the Soviets _ the Soviets have criticized very sharply
this distinction of yours to the point of saying they're going
forward and the United States is going backwards. What is your
reaction to this?
   A: My reaction is I need to get on a wire there _ in a telegram
or something _ explain this to Mr. Gorbachev. It's not altogether
surprising that he doesn't understand some of the special
arrangements that the United States has in Panama. It's not
surprising that he doesn't fully understand that this freely
elected man had been deprived of the democracy, and I also need to
let him know, OK, if American Marine is killed _ if they kill an
American Marine, that's real bad. And if they threaten and
brutalize the wife of an American citizen, sexually threatening the
lieutenant's wife while kicking him in the groin over and over
again, then, Mr. Gorbachev, please understand, this President is
going to do something about it.
   So we'll have to explain it very _ the last one, Maureen, and
then I really do have to go.

   Q: Will you bring any troops home by Christmas?
   Q: Mr. President, we now find out that last summer when we
thought that your policy was no contact with the Chinese
government, that you sent a high-level delegation there to talk to
them. Don't you feel that American people deserve to know that when
you say something not's happening, that it's really not happening?
   A: Yes, I do think they do, but I didn't say that. I said ``no
high-level exchanges.'' So, please look at it carefully.
   Q: But you didn't tell us that this was happening _
   A: Well, but _ no, I feel no obligation to do that. I feel an
obligation to keep you informed, but I have an obligation as
President to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way I
see fit, reporting under the law to the United States Congress. You
could say, ``How come you didn't tell me that you were going down
to invade the _ send in those troops down into Panama?'' Because I
didn't want to take a chance the information would get out. That is
the responsibility of a President, and I will continue to exercise
it while having 37 press conferences next year.
   She's got a follow-up.
   Q: Does that mean all kinds of other secret diplomatic missions
going on around that we have no idea?
   A: Maybe not of that magnitude, but there's a lot going on.
There's a lot of going on that, in the conduct of the foreign
policy or a debate within the U.S. government, has to be sorted out
without the spotlight of the news. There has to be that way. The
whole opening to China would never have happened _ the whole _ the
whole _ yes, if Kissinger hadn't undertaken that mission. It would
have fallen apart. So you have to use your own judgment.
   And you've got your job, and that is to find out absolutely
everything you can _ careful, I'm sure _ most of you are about
legitimate national security concerns, but I have mine. And that is
to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way I think best.
If the American people don't like it, I expect they'll get somebody
else to take my job, but I'm going to keep doing it, and we've had
a very open administration _ very.
   But once in a while, if I go to try to set up a meeting with Mr.
Gorbachev, we've got people here who scream, who say, ``You should
have told us that the day you wrote the letter to him.'' I don't
agree with that, and I was elected so I'm going to keep on trying
to do this with an openness _ I hope, a new openness _ but also,
the right of a President to conduct his business _ in this case of
Panama, to safeguard the lives of American kids.
   And the other one _ to go and see what happens. I know how China
works _ see what we can do, make a representation of how strongly
we feel against human rights abuse, but see what it's going to take
to go forward.
   Thank you all.

   Final payments totaling about $113 million are
going out to states as their share of national forest sales
receipts this year, the Agriculture Department said Thursday.
   F. Dale Robertson, chief of the Forest Service, said the money
was in addition to a preliminary payment of $248 million that went
to the states Sept. 28, bringing the total for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30 to about $362 million.
   By law, 25 percent of the revenues collected by the Forest
Service for the sale of timber and other use of national forest
resources must be returned to the states where the forests are
located. Actual receipts in fiscal 1989 totaled approximately $1.44
billion.
   The states are required to use the funds for schools and roads.
   Oregon is the biggest recipient of total forest receipts for
1989 with $164 million, followed by Calfornia with $67 million and
Washington with $47 million.

<HEAD>With AM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Israel television said Thursday that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, a fugitive from U.S. justice since American
forces invaded Panama this week, was spotted within the last 24
hours on the luxurious island of Contadora.
   Israel television correspondent Hanan Azran told The Associated
Press that Noriega and Mike Harrari, a former agent in Israel's
Mossad intelligence agency and a top Noriega aide, were on
Contadora, 40 miles southeast of Panama City, planning an escape to
Nicaragua where they would ask for asylum.
   Azran said the television report was based on two phone calls he
received from ``people who are close to Mike and the weapons
business there.'' He said similar phone calls were also made to the
Panamanian embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Azran said the callers, who he would only further identify as
native Spanish speakers, said Noriega and Harrari were spotted with
their aides on Contadora within the last 24 hours.
   ``They explained to me that Harrari's plan is to cross the
border into Costa Rica and then Nicaragua,'' Azran said.
   Contadora first came to public attention when the Shah of Iran
stayed several months there after he was exiled from his country.
   Contadora was where the foreign ministers of four Latin
countries, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia and Panama, met in 1981 to
negotiate the first attempts at peace in Central America. The four
later expanded to a group of eight including South American
countries, but Panama was later suspended from the group.
   Azran said Harrari and Noriega plan to go from Contadora to
Chiriqui, a small town in the north of the country, which ``Noreiga
has already prepared for himself with his own people.''
   Azran said he was told the two men would then cross with their
forces into Costa Rica and later Nicaragua.
   Harrari, a renegade Mossad agent, is regarded as a top Noriega
advisor.
   Israel's foreign ministry refused to comment on Harrari's
actions saying the ministry does not comment on the actions of
private citizens.
   There was no immediate comment on the Israeli television report
from U.S. or Panamanian officials.

   Eleven people associated with the Smithsonian
Institution were reported free but awaiting pickup by U.S. troops a
day after Panamanian forces abducted them, President Bush and
Smithsonian officials said Thursday.
   ``They have been released by the Panamanian Defense Forces,''
said Madeleine Jacobs, a Smithsonian spokeswoman. ``But they are
not safe; they are not in U.S. hands; we are very concerned.''
   Bush, questioned at a news conference about Americans hostages
in Panama, said the Smithsonian people ``have now been released.''
He said he had no idea how many other people were being held in
Panama against their will.
   Smithsonian officials said the group who worked at the
Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute on the San Blas islands in
the Caribbean off the coast of Panama was in a remote location
between Cerro Carti and El Llano on the mainland.
   Members of the group had access to a radio that enabled them to
contact Smithsonian employees in Panama City, Jacobs said.
   At the time the group was kidnapped by members of the PDF, a
technician on the island called Panama City to say they were being
transferred to the mainland and taken by truck to an unknown
destination, Jacobs said.
   The group _ five Americans, five Panamanians and one Venezuelan
_ worked as scientists or technicians. They were performing marine
research on the coral reef.
   Jacobs refused to identify members of the group. But she said
only one American worked for the Smithsonian. The others were
affiliated with universities or research operations.
   Besides its station at Sanblas and the headquarters at Panama
City, the tropical institute has several other stations throughout
the isthmus. Most of the staff members, 120 of whom work full time,
are Americans and Panamanians.

<HEAD>Parliament to Dissolve in March, to Pave Way for Elections</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parliament on Thursday voted to
dissolve itself on March 16, paving the way for the first free
elections in the country in more than four decades.
   Before it dissolves, however, Parliament will begin discussing a
motion at its January session calling for the complete withdrawal
of all Soviet troops from Hungary. Defense Minister Ferenc Karpati
announced plans for the continued withdrawal as part of Moscow's
unilateral troop pullout from Eastern Europe.
   Dispensing with the usual show-of-hands voting, 320 deputies
decided by roll call vote to end parliament's mandate March 16.
There were two abstentions and no votes against.
   The house also adopted the government's budget for 1990 which
foresees strict austerity measures agreed with the International
Monetary Fund.
   Negotiations with the IMF for hard-currency loans necessary to
help Hungary service its $20 billion foreign debt and revamp its
economy hinged on the adoption of the budget.
   No date was set for the elections, the first free balloting
since the Communists took power in 1948. Acting president Matyas
Sueros was to announce a date by Friday.
   Elections were due in June but there have been increasing calls
for them to be moved up.
   Hungary is one of at least four East European nations expecting
their first free elections since the communists took power more
than 40 years ago in the first half of 1990.
   In East Germany, elections are scheduled for May 6. In Bulgaria
and Czechoslovakia, plans have also been announced for free
elections before the end of June.
   The budget adopted by parliament after considerable debate, is
to lead to price rises as subsidies on consumer goods prices are
reduced and could contribute to unemployment as loss-making firms
are closed down.
   The IMF wants to see the country's budget deficit, which is
likely to reach $800 million this year, cut to $156 million in 1990
as a precondition to further loans.
   A crucial $1 billion World Bank loan hinges on the IMF agreement
as does a $1.14 billion loan from the European Community.
   Hungary is to resume its negotiations with the IMF in January.
   In presenting the budget Wednesday, Finance Minister Laszlo
Bekesi said there would be a drastic reduction of subsidies to loss
making companies by $720 million, which in turn could double or
even quadruple the number of unemployed, currently at 25,000.
   Subsidies on consumer and producer prices are also to be reduced
which will lead to price increases averaging 25 percent on foods
starting in January.
   Bekesi said the budget was designed to ``avoid economic
collapse,'' and he called it a ``crisis budget.''
   The house Wednesday adopted a new bill on housing that will lead
to an increase of average rents by 35 percent starting Feb. 1. It
also levied a home loan tax.
   Bekesi said interest payments on the country's $20 billion
foreign debt will amount to $1.5 billion in 1990 and payment on the
principle would be another $1.9 billion.
   As part of the country's ongoing economic reform designed to
introduce market forces into the economy, the government's economic
program foresees initiating bankruptcy proceedings against
unprofitable enterprises, lifting state control of wages, and
moving towards increased privatization of industry.
   Retired Brig. Gen. Janos Sebok put a motion before Parliament
for the withdrawal of the estimated 50,000 Soviet troops in Hungary
by the end of 1990, saying there was no longer any military or
political reason for them to be there.
   Karpati said a tactical missile brigade, a fighter bomber air
wing, a mechanized rifle regiment, two armored car battalions and
two contruction troops would be withdrawn next year, the state news
agency MTI reported.
   He did not say how many troops that would entail. More than
10,000 troops were withdrawn from Hungary this year.
   A year ago, Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev announced a plan
to withdraw 50,000 troops stationed in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
East Germany.
   On Wednesday, Czechoslovakia and Moscow agreed a joint
commission should by mid-January start reviewing the presence of
80,000 Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia.

   Relatives and friends of Americans killed when Pan Am Flight 103
blew up a year ago over Lockerbie, Scotland, honored the 270
victims on Thursday. Bells pealed on the anniversary of the tragedy.
   Pan Am took out full-page ads in newspapers here and abroad
urging the public to pray ``for these and all other victims of
terrorism all over the world'' at 2:02 p.m. EST, the exact time
that the plane exploded.
   In addition to holding memorials at Kennedy, Heathrow and
Frankfort airports, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said, ``all of
our employees did pause at 2:02 at their workplaces around the
world, observing a moment of silence.''
   Pan Am offered to fly families of victims to memorial services
in Lockerbie. About two dozen attended.
   Those marching past Pan Am headquarters in New York City were
mostly silent in the 20-degree temperatures, although some carried
signs with messages such as ``270 people murdered over Scotland''
and ``We are all victims of Pan Am Flight 103.'' Many wore
photographs of loved ones pinned to their coats. It was an exercise
some relatives go through each month in front of Pan Am to
publicize what they say was lax security that allowed the bomb to
be planted on the plane.
   The protest was followed by a memorial service at St. George's
Episcopal Church attended by about 300 people. The name of each
victim was read aloud and 270 white carnations were placed on a
large Christmas wreath.
   Mary Allen DeSantis, an aunt of 25-year-old victim Julian
Benello, said the memorial activities consist of ``a lot of tears,
a lot of anger and a lot of unanswered questions.''
   Jeannine Boulanger, of Shrewsbury, Mass., whose 21-year-old
daughter died in the crash, said she was angered over Pan Am's ad
asking for a moment of silence for the victims.
   ``That's the reason we're here. Because there was too much
silence,'' she said.
   About 200 people lighted candles and placed remembrance roses at
a service at Holy Trinity Church in Washington, D.C. Dignitaries on
hand included Sir Antony Acland, Britian's ambassador to the United
States, who read a passage from the New Testament.
   ``Terrorism is on the rise and has become a plague of our world
today,'' Bert Ammerman of River Vale, N.J., whose brother Tom was
killed, told the gathering.
   Ammerman, president of a support group of Flight 103 victims'
relatives, also sent an open letter to President Bush urging
stepped-up efforts to punish those responsible for the bombing.
   ``Obviously, nothing you can do will bring back our loved
ones,'' he told Bush in the letter. ``But without appropriate
retaliatory action, terrorist groups and the outlaw nations of the
world will, quite understandably, assume that American citizens are
easy prey any time they want to make their point on the world
stage.''
   Many memorials, like ones in Greensburg, Pa., and Ramsey, N.J.,
consisted of chiming bells at 2:02 p.m. EST.
   Bells also pealed one year to the minute at Syracuse University,
which lost 35 students. Although most students had already departed
for Christmas break, 550 people attended a campus memorial last
week.
   Many of those who lost friends and relatives preferred to mourn
in seclusion.
   In Massachusetts, Emily Pescatore said she could not make it
overseas to commemorate the anniversary of her son's death, so she
arranged for a service Thursday night in a Dedham church that was
to include a candle-lighting ceremony and a bagpipe processional.
Other families of victims were expected to attend; 19 New
Englanders were killed in the explosion.
   John Boland, of Nashua, N.H., who lost his son Stephen, 21, said
he wants publicity about the event to fade because every reminder
is painful.
   ``We have a good two or three weeks, and then we're sitting at
supper, watching the 7 o'clock news, and see a plane coming down,''
he said. ``I don't want to watch it. I've seen that plane come down
enough.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush vigorously defended sending
unannounced high-level missions to Beijing, saying Thursday that if
Americans didn't approve, ``I expect they'd get somebody else to
take my job.''
   Bush compared his sending envoys to China in July and in August,
despite the government's bloody Tiananmen Square crackdown against
protesters in June, to then-President Nixon's decision to dispatch
aide Henry Kissinger to China in 1972.
   ``The whole opening to China would never have happened if
Kissinger hadn't undertaken that mission. It would have fallen
apart. So you have to use your own judgment,'' Bush told a news
conference.
   He denied that sending his national security adviser, Brent
Scowcroft, and a senior State Department official to Beijing on the
two trips represented a violation of sanctions he imposed on China.
   Bush ordered a halt to ``high level exchanges'' which he
insisted Thursday did not apply to government-to-government
contacts between officials.
   The administration claims that Scowcroft's visits were
``contacts'' rather than ``exchanges.''
   Bush said he felt ``no obligation'' to announce the missions.
   ``I feel an obligation to keep you informed, but I have an
obligation as president to conduct the foreign policy of this
country the way I see fit, reporting under the law to the United
States Congress.''
   Asked if similar clandesdine missions were now under way, Bush
said, ``maybe not of that magnitude (but) there's a lot of going on
in the conduct of the foreign policy that ... has to be sorted out
without the spotlight of the news.''
   ``You've got your job and that is to find out absolutely
everything you can,'' Bush told reporters. ``But I have mine, and
that is to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way I
think best. ... If the American people don't like it, I suspect
they'd get somebody else to take my job.''
   Bush also noted that he had been criticized from some quarters
for not announcing sooner his Mediterranean meeting with Soviet
President Mikhail S. earlier this month.
   ``I don't agree with that. And I was elected,'' Bush insisted.

   President Bush on Thursday signed into law a
bill prohibiting U.S. support for international lending projects
unless their environmental impact is studied first.
   The purpose of the bill is to force international lending
agencies such as the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank to consider the potential environmental consequences of
development projects in the Third World.
   ``Multilateral banks should not provide support to projects that
destroy the natural resource base of countries we're trying to

   Argentina and Britain resumed
consular ties on Thursday after a nearly eight-year gap that dated
back to the Falkland Islands War.
   Alan Hunt presented his credentials to the Foreign Ministry and
was accepted as Britain's consul. A similar ceremony took place in
London, where Santos Goni was accredited as the Argentine consul.
   Since the 1982 war, which Argentina launched to recover
territory in the South Atlantic it has claimed since the last
century, each country has maintained only an interest section in
the other: Argentina at Brazil's embassy in London, Britain at the
Swiss Embassy in Buenos Aires.
   Consular flags will be hoisted in London and Buenos Aires on
Friday.
   The way was paved for a thaw in relations by the election of
Carlos Menem as Argentina's president last May. Menem dropped the
government's previous insistence that ownership of the Falklands be
an issue in any bilateral talks.
   The countries have agreed to resume air and maritime
communications and lift all remaining commercial and financial
restrictions and restrictive practices imposed since 1982.
   They also agreed to an umbrella clause that protects their
respective claims to sovereignty over the islands, which are
inhabited by 1,800 people, mostly British descendants.
   A further meeting in February is expected to lead to resumption
of full diplomatic relations.
   Buenos Aires surrendered to a British task force on June 14,
1982, 74 days after invading the South Atlantic archipelago.

   A plane carrying four humanitarian workers
from a southern Sudan town that is surrounded by rebels was shot
down Thursday shortly after takeoff, and all aboard were killed, a
United Nations source said.
   In the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, a statement by the Armed
Forces General Command accused rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army of downing the plane with a Sam-7 missile.
   The U.N. source, who refused to be identified, said the
twin-engine plane was headed for Khartoum from Aweil when it was
downed by ground fire, the source said.
   Aweil, 590 miles southwest of Khartoum, is a government garrison
town said to be surrounded by rebels of the Sudan People's
Liberation Army.
   The source said three of the victims were French nationals, the
fourth a Sudanese. He was unable to provide names, but said the
doctor and nurse worked for Doctors Without Frontiers, a French
organization.
   Officials at the Paris-based organization identified the dead as
Yvon Feliot, a pilot working for the humanitarian group; Laurent
Fernet, a supply specialist; and Jean-Paul Bescond, a doctor, all
French nationals. The fourth was Frazer Ariyaba, a Sudanese
technician for the World Food Program.
   The Sudanese army statement said the plane's four passengers
were ``humanitarian messengers who devoted their lives to the
service of man in his most difficult times.''
   It said the downing of the plane was aimed at undermining peace
efforts and destabilizing the country.
   The plane belonged to the Sudanese government, the U.N. source
said. He said it was not clear what type of weapon was used to down
the plane or who fired it.
   The rebels have been battling the Moslem-dominated government in
Khartoum for six years in an effort to win greater autonomy and
economic benefits for the largely Christian south.
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar said
he was grieved by the incident and called on the government and
rebels to ``reinstitute a cease-fire and ensure safe passage for
the humanitarian assistance.''

<TEXT>
   A panel of mental health experts cast doubt
Thursday on the FBI conclusion that Clayton Hartwig triggered an
explosion on the U.S.S. Iowa because he wanted to commit suicide
and kill his shipmates.
   ``I do not believe that Clayton Hartwig was suicidal and I
certainly do not believe he was suicidial-homicidal,'' Dr. Douglas
Jacobs told the House Armed Service Committee.
   The FBI, however, said it stood behind its findings.
   Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard University
Medical School and director of the Suicide Education Institute of
Boston, was on a 14-member panel of mental health experts that
examined the FBI findings after the April 19 blast that killed
Hartwig and 46 crewmembers.
   The panel consisted of 12 psychologists appointed on a pro bono
basis by the American Psychological Association at the request of
the Armed Services Committee and two psychiatrists named by the
committee. Seven of the 14 panel members appeared at Thursday's
hearing.
   Members of the House committee, which is investigating the
Navy's conclusion that Hartwig most likely caused the explosion in
the battleship's No. 2 gun turret, attacked the methods the FBI
used to reach its conclusion.
   Lawmakers criticized the fact that no independent interviews
were conducted and that analysts relied entirely on interview
summaries and other material supplied by the Navy Investigative
Service.
   Hartwig's parents and a sister attended Thursday's hearing.
   When asked why no review had been made of such primary documents
as Hartwig's personnel and medical records, Robert Hazelwood of the
FBI's National Violent Crime Center, replied: ``We were satisfied
with the information we received.''
   ``I find it mind-boggling that you are asserting
criminal-homicidal conduct and do not go to the primary
documents,'' said Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind. ``I think it is
almost fatally flawed.''
   ``We are very comfortable in our honest assertion,'' Hazelwood
responded.
   Eight of the psychologists and both psychiatrists took serious
exception to both the FBI's methods and the conclusions drawn.
   ``It is my conclusion that the data is qualitatively and
quantitatively weak and does not warrant the conclusion that was
drawn,'' said Dr. Ronald S. Ebert, senior forensic psychologist at
McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass.
   ``I got the impression that there was a determination that had
been made and then data had to be gathered (by Navy investigators)
to support that determination,'' Ebert said.
   Norman G. Poythress, professor of psychology at the University
of Alabama, said that while suicide could not be ruled out
arbitrarily, ``I don't think the conclusion is nearly as strong as
has been characterized.''
   He noted that Hartwig had told a friend in an April letter that
his service aboard the Iowa was soon to end, that he had strong
attachments to the ship and its crew and that he wanted to stay in
port to wave the Iowa goodbye when it sailed in June.
   ``This is not a man in my judgment who had willing disregard for
his shipmates,'' Poythress said.
   However, Alan Berman, professor of psychology at American
University, said he was ``comfortable'' with the conclusion that
Hartwig committed suicide.
   ``Unfortunately, I am uncomfortable with the procedure that led
to the data,'' Berman said.
   Robert P. Archer, professor of psychiatry at the Eastern
Virginia Medical School at Norfolk, outlined the reasons for the
inadequacy of the data the FBI reviewed.
   There was no information on Hartwig's early development, family
environment or family history, including suicide, legal history,
medical and psychological records and alcohol or drug abuse, he
said.
   ``It is my opinion that the evidence is not sufficient to say
the explosion was the result of a homicidal or suicidal act by
Hartwig,'' Archer said.

<HEAD>Tass Gives Details on Romanian Protests, No Defense of Ceausescu</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Tass news agency dispatched dramatic
and detailed reports from Romania's capital early Friday, making
little attempt to hide the swelling public feelings against
President Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Absent from the Tass reports were any details of Ceausescu's
speech at an official rally in Bucharest, where he was shouted down.
   In years past, Tass would have emphasized Ceausescu's views.
Instead, it reported the growing protests against him and clashes
between demonstrators and police.
   The coverage highlighted the Kremlin's changing attitude toward
the conservative Communist stalwart, which has resulted in frosty
meetings between Ceausescu and reform-minded Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev repeatedly has expressed support for the reformers who
have taken power this year in other Eastern European countries.
   The Soviet president withheld comment on the events in Romania,
where hundreds, perhaps thousands, have been reported killed in
recent days. He told the Soviet parliament that members from the
republic of Moldavia had called for adoption of a statement on the
turmoil in the country on their eastern border.
   But Gorbachev said the Soviet Union had not received enough
information about the events to warrant comment, even though the
Foreign Ministry summoned the Romanian ambassador in Moscow and
asked its envoy in Bucharest to supply details.
   ``The Romanian ambassador here does not provide an opportunity
to form a notion of what is taking place in that country,''
Gorbachev told the 2,250 deputies.
   Tass, meanwhile, spoke of swelling numbers of demonstrators
shouting anti-Ceausescu slogans. It said the government responded
with tanks patrolling the streets, and ``There is yet no official
response to the events in Bucharest.''
   Tass also reported that at least two people were killed after
they were run over by an armored personnel carrier and that
demonstrators were fired on.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev, at a Moscow
briefing, declined comment.
   ``If we do receive information on victims among people we of
course will be extremely sorry for them,'' he said.
   But he added: ``We should emphasize that we do have opinions on
what is happening but in my place as an official representative of
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs I cannot go into comments without
having all-inclusive information and orders in that regard.''
   The Kremlin's attitude toward the Romanian leader became
apparent Dec. 4 after Ceausescu met Gorbachev in Moscow.
   An official report said the two met in ``comradely fashion in
the spirit of an open exchange of opinions.'' In diplomatic jargon,
that means they disagreed sharply.
   In the Soviet republic of Moldavia, which borders Romania and
has a large populace that speak a Romanian dialect, activists said
they planned an outdoor religious service Friday for victims of the
bloodshed in Romania.
   Moldavians are ethnically very close to Romanians, but the
border between their republic and Romania has been tightly guarded
since Ceausescu refused in 1968 to take part in the Warsaw Pact
invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Natalya Pascal, a spokeswoman for the Moldavian People's Front,
said ethnic Moldavians had not been able to gather any detailed
information on the events across the border.

   A federal judge Thursday delayed the start of
John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial and demanded to see excerpts
from former President Reagan's diaries and notes, which Poindexter
wants to use in court.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said, ``President Reagan
shall produce for the court's ... inspection'' by Jan. 7 some of
the materials sought by Poindexter. Greene will then determine
whether the material is relevant to the criminal charges against
Reagan's former national security adviser.
   Greene moved back the Jan. 22 starting date of Poindexter's
trial until Feb. 20, saying a delay is necessary because of pending
issues. Those include Poindexter's subpoenas, approved by the
court, seeking Reagan's documents.
   Greene quashed major portions of Poindexter's subpoenas for
documents from the former president, but kept in place the most
sensitive sections, those dealing with Reagan's diaries, notes and
notebooks.
   ``The court is not disposed to requiring President Reagan to
make wholesale production of documents which ultimately may turn
out to contain little or no material evidence,'' said the judge.
   ``The obvious answer to this dilemma ... is an ... examination
by the court of the relevant excerpts from the former president's
diaries, notes and notebooks to determine whether they contain
specific evidence that should be produced,'' said Greene.
   Greene said ``legal and historical precedents indicate'' that a
review by the judge is appropriate ``of the presidential papers at
issue.''
   The judge said that he will review the Reagn documents and
``render a decision on the ... parts of the Reagan diary, notes and
notebooks that must be made available'' to Poindexter.
   Poindexter obtained court approval to issue the subpoena for
Reagan's documents by submitting a secret paper outlining what he
believes they contain.
   The judge said that Reagan and President Bush will be permitted
to see that paper next month, if Reagan invokes executive privilege
in response to any decision by Greene to turn Reagan documents over
Poindexter.
   Executive privilege is the legal concept by which presidents can
shield from public disclosure documents used in carrying out their
constitutional duties. In the Watergate cases involving President
Nixon, courts ruled that the privilege could not be used to protect
evidence needed in a criminal trial.
   Poindexter separately sought approval to subpoenaed Reagan
earlier this week, seeking testimony from the former president in
person.
   Greene set up a schedule for Reagan's lawyers and President Bush
to file objections to that testimonial subpoena and for
Poindexter's lawyers to respond to the objections. Greene said he
will rule on the matter sometime after Jan. 8.
   The judge in October outlined Poindexter's statement of what he
expected to discover, filed in support of a request to issue a
subpoena to Reagan for documents.
   Reagan met Poindexter daily, frequently alone, and they
discussed specific matters which now are connected to the criminal
charges against Poindexter, the former national security adviser
says.
   The subjects discussed with Reagan include the accuracy of a
chronology prepared by former White House aide Oliver North and
reviewed by Poindexter, according to Greene's outline.
   The chronology falsely says no one in the U.S. government knew
until 1986 that a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment to Iran
contained Hawk missiles.
   Four of the five criminal charges against Poindexter relate to
allegedly lying about the 1985 shipment.
   Reagan also discussed the administration's view of a House
resolution inquiring into whether North was raising money and
supplying military advice to the Contras.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress by sending letters
endorsing earlier White House denials that North was assisting the
Contras.
   Poindexter had subpoenaed documents from reagan touching on 67
meetings or events involving the former president and his national
security adviser. Fifty of the meetings or events involved the
Contras and 17 involved the administration's secret arms sales to
Iran, according to papers filed in the case.
   Poindexter also served a subpoena on the archivist of the United
States, who holds presidential documents. Greene quashed that
subpoena after the archivist asserted that he already had turned
over to the prosecutors the documents Poindexter was seeking.

   President Bush gave a light-hearted account
Thursday of a ``catastrophic ice-skating accident'' in which his
13-year-old grandson ``bit the dust.''
   Young George P. Bush said later he had five stitches in his chin
after the accident at a public skating rink about two blocks from
the White House.
   The president also was ailing.
   ``I have a pain in the neck _ seriously,'' Bush told reporters
during an afternoon news conference.
   The president clearly had trouble moving his head, and White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush got a stiff neck
while lying on a couch Thursday morning reading an intelligence
report. Fitzwater said a doctor gave Bush some medication, which he
declined to identify.
   Bush described his grandson's mishap as he explained the absence
of his wife, Barbara, at a ceremony commemorating the Jewish
holiday of Hanukkah.
   ``She started to walk over here. Then there was this
catastrophic ice-skating accident in which one of our grandchildren
bit the dust. He's now getting a stitch put in his lip,'' the
president said.
   ``Life goes on,'' Bush added.
   Jean Becker, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Bush, said the youth was
getting five or six stitches in his chin, not his lip. He was
treated by the White House physician, Dr. Burton Lee, she said.
   The youngster is the son of John and Columba Bush.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev blasted Lithuania's
Communists on Thursday for breaking with the national Communist
Party in their drive to restore their republic's sovereignty.
   The national Communist Party Central Committee scheduled an
emergency meeting to discuss the historic defiance.
   Rimantas Kanapenes, a spokesman for Lithuania's political group
Sajudis, said Gorbachev summoned Lithuanian members of the national
parliament to protest Wednesday's decision by the Lithuanian
Communist Party Congress to end subordination to the national party
and declare itself independent, with its own rules and program.
   The Kremlin had warned of ``great trouble'' ahead for the
Lithuanians, and it came fast.
   ``This decision should be assessed only as a step aimed at the
split of the Lithuanian Communist Party from the Soviet Communist
Party,'' the ruling Politburo said in a message to the Lithuanian
Communists.
   ``This concerns not only the Lithuanian Communist Party but the
entire party.''
   The message was signed by Gorbachev and reported by the official
news agency Tass.
   Gorbachev told the Congress he shared the ``concern and alarm''
of many Communists about Lithuania's action and said the Politburo
decided to call an emergency meeting of the Central Committee, its
parent body, on the issue ``in a few days.''
   He said dozens of Communist members wrote him notes calling
Lithuania's action ``very sad for all Communists'' and describing
it as ``a new step in a separatist tendency in the country, a new
enormous danger for the Soviet Communist Party and our
multi-national state.''
   ``The alarm is growing, the chain reaction has started,'' the
notes read.
   A Sajudis official has predicted the Communist parties of
neighboring Latvia and Estonia in the Baltics, and Armenia and
Georgia in the Caucasus, would follow Lithuania's lead and break
off from the national party.
   Kanapenes said Gorbachev telephoned Lithuanian party chief
Algirdas Brazauskas in Vilnius, the republic's capital, shortly
after the 855-160 vote to break away from the national party.
   ``Brazauskas said it was a very difficult conversation,''
Kanapenes said. ``Gorbachev said he was very sorry'' about the
decision.
   Brazauskas told a news conference in Vilnius Thursday night he
had a ``very correct talk'' with Gorbachev and denied rumors that
Gorbachev threatened to declare martial law in Lithuania.
   ``It's a great anecdote, but there was no such talk,'' he said.
   He said he understood why some orthodox Communists were upset.
   ``I think it's a very important step toward perestroika, but for
someone who can't imagine such profound restructuring it must be a
real shock.''
   The Lithuanian Congress reinforced its stand Thursday by
approving statutes implementing the break with the national party
and re-electing the 57-year-old Brazauskas as its first secretary.
   Kanapenes said Gorbachev aides also called in the head of
Sajudis, Vytautas Landsbergis.
   A resolution approved by Lithuania's legislature declares the
republic's party an ``equal partner with the Soviet Communist
Party, other progressive parties, public organizations and
movements.''
   That position runs counter to more than 80 years of party
policy. Before the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution, Vladimir I. Lenin
demanded unity, and a 1921 party congress formally ruled out any
factions.
   Tass said about 160 Lithuanian congress delegates who voted
against the breakoff met in Vilnius on Thursday. It said the
dissident group, claiming to represent a quarter of the republic's
Communists, pledged to work to maintain ties with the national
party.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev had said Wednesday that
Lithuania's move ``is great trouble for the people and for
Communists.''
   Lithuanians ``just do not realize yet what grief will descend.''
   Lithuanian leaders on Dec. 7 supported a move by the legislature
to create a multiparty political system, striking from the Baltic
republic's constitution language making the Communist Party the
leading force in society.
   The Communists' new program also supports eventual restoration
of the independence Lithuania enjoyed between the world wars. The
Soviet Union absorbed the region in 1940 under secret agreements
with Nazi Germany.
   Several small political parties already have formed to challenge
the Communists in Feb. 24 local elections, and Lithuanian Communist
leaders say they need an independent structure to compete in the
balloting.

   A storage tank leaked at a chemical
plant Thursday, sending up a stinging, toxic cloud of acid that
drifted over the Swiss-French border, authorities said.
   Residents were warned to close windows and stay indoors for more
than an hour as the cigar-shaped cloud, about 1,000 yards long,
drifted toward France.
   The chlorosulfonic acid, which is used in the manufacture of
dyes, leaked from a tank at Ciba-Geigy, Switzerland's largest
chemical company.
   Four workers and eight residents were treated for irritated eyes
and coughing; two of these were hospitalized.
   Chlorosulfonic acid can cause lung injuries if inhaled for some
time.
   The accident occurred while the acid was being pumped from a
railway tanker into a storage tank, the company said.
   Special fire brigades from Ciba Geigy and nearby companies would
remain on the site until the over-filled storage tank was safely
emptied.
   The accident set off the biggest alarm in the Basel region since
a 1986 toxic spill in the Rhine River caused one of Europe's worst
environmental disasters.

<UNK>News Agency Says Army Confiscated Panama Videotape</UNK>

   An Army soldier confiscated the tape of a TV
news agency cameraman who shot pictures Thursday of U.S. troops
surrounding the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in Panama City, the
agency's bureau chief here said.
   A complaint will be filed with the Pentagon, said Robert
Sullivan, bureau chief of Worldwide Television News. Based in
London, WTN is co-owned by ABC and includes ABC, CBS and CNN among
its clients.
   Sullivan said the WTN camerman, Alejandro Carbonnel, a
Panamanian, was shooting pictures when an U.S. Army sergeant
approached him and confiscated the cameraman's videotape.
   Carbonnel said the soldier gave no explanation other that the
cameraman ``had to have permission from the Southern Command to
shoot here,'' Sullivan said. He said the sergeant's indentity isn't
known..
   The Southern Command is the multi-service U.S. military command
running the military strike in Panama that was aimed at toppling
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The American troops in Panama City surrounded the Cuban and
Nicaruagan embassies there Thursday after rumors spread that
Noriega may have fled to one of the embassies during the U.S.
military invasion of his country.
   Carbonel was among the press corps in Panama when the invasion
began Wednesday. He is not part of the Pentagon press pool flown
there. NBC correspondent Fred Francis is the pool's correspondent
for the major networks.

<TEXT>
   Shipowners of many countries that fly the flag
of Panama so they can pay lower wages and taxes won't have to
reflag their vessels, President Bush said Thursday.
   With the installation of President Guillermo Endara, the U.S. is
lifting sanctions imposed against the government of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega. Bush said the action is a measure of support for
the new U.S.-backed government.
   One of those sanctions, announced Nov. 30 and scheduled to go
into effect Jan. 31, would have barred ships flying the Panamanian
flag from entering American ports. U.S. officials had said the
action would deny Noriega and his government tens of millions of
dollars of revenue.
   ``Noriega's cronies will also be deprived of millions of dollars
of illegal income in the form of bribes and kickbacks,'' the White
House said in a Nov. 30 statement announcing the sanction.
   Owners of ships registered in Panama pay a fee based on tonnage,
but they don't pay any tax on earnings as they might have to do if
they registered the ships with their own government.
   The flags of Liberia, Cyprus and the Bahamas are also called
``flags of convenience.''
   The State Department estimated that 1,500 ships of more than
1,000 tons would have been affected by the ban.
   Philip J. Loree, chairman of the Federation of American
Controlled Shipping, said that as many as 10,000 ships may fly the
Panama flag, but that many of them are small and never come into
U.S. ports.
   Loree said that registration of about 400 ships, mostly
Japanese, had been changed in anticipation of the ban at an
estimated cost of $16 million.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said Thursday
that U.S. troops were still involved in ``conflict and firefights''
in Panama City well into the second day of the U.S. intervention.
   However, he said the operation had been ``enormously
successful'' during its first 36 hours, despite the fact that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega had escaped capture.
   Cheney said taking Noriega had been ``only one of several
objectives'' in the intervention.
   The defense secretary pledged to get U.S. forces in Panama home
``as quickly as we can,'' but he also said the date remains open as
long as is at large and civil unrest continues.
   ``It's still a situation in which there is ongoing conflict and
firefights,'' said Cheney said, acknowledging the possibility of
individual terrorist strikes and the taking of U.S. hostages.
   ``Clearly, we haven't resolved all the potential situations
where there may be Americans being held,'' Cheney said in an
interview with 11 newspaper and wire service reporters. ``We are
aggressively working every one of those cases.''
   Major resistance had ended, he said, and ``we don't have any
reason at this point to anticipate any sort of organized attacks.''
   Pressed to predict when the American invasion force could be
brought home, Cheney said that remains ``an open question.''
   President Bush, meanwhile, said U.S. troops would pursue Noriega
``as long as it takes'' and he called the nation's commitment to
the operation in Panama ``open-ended.''
   Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
sat at Cheney's side during the briefing and both men refused to
speculate where Noriega might be hiding. Both men appeared somewhat
tired after their hours-long vigils at the Pentagon.
   Powell said that while there still appears to be resistance by
Noriega loyalists in Panama City ``for the most part it is
disorganized resistance ... it will dry up over time.'' The
four-star general said he did not believe that the resistance was
``under the direction of a central command.''
   U.S. forces encountered sporadic firing in Panama City while
trying to recover American hostages, capture Noriega and restore
democracy, Pentagon officials said.
   Those were the three main objectives of the nearly 24,000 U.S.
troops, who on Wednesday dispersed the Panamanian Defense Forces. A
key to restoring order was gaining control of the streets of Panama
City, where looting was reported overnight.
   U.S. forces were in control of several key points in the city,
including the legislative building, said Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams, raising the possibility that Guillermo Endara, the new
U.S.-backed president, would go there during the day.
   Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, director of operations for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, also said U.S. troops were protecting the Panama Canal
against sabotage by Noriega loyalists. He rated the chances for
successful attacks as ``low _ not impossible, but low.''
   He said all Panamian bases were in U.S. hands, although ``some
shooting'' was reported in the city.
   ``It appears there is some resistance that is organized and some
that isn't,'' Kelly said. Noriega was not believed to be in command
of any units that were resisting, he said.
   ``We do not think he is effectively in command of anything at
this time,'' said Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, an intelligence specialist
with the joint staff.
   The latest U.S. military casualty count stood at 21 killed in
action, 208 wounded and four missing. The first American dead were
flown back to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware.
   In addition, Candy Helin, 43, the wife U.S. serviceman Steve
Helin, was dead. Mrs. Helin, who taught gifted chiuldren at a U.S.
government school in Panama and was the daughter of a former Army
port commander, was killed by stray fire from the Panamanian
Defense Forces.
   Helin told his sister, Jane Sheaffer of Dixon, Ill., that his
wife was killed in an ambush as the couple drove home on a dark
road early Wednesday from dinner at a friend's.
   ``We don't think she was shot deliberately,'' Kelly said.
   U.S. officials put the casualty count for Panamanian Defense
Forces as 59 killed, 66 wounded.
   U.S. forces captured 1,500 Panamanian soldiers, but were unsure
how many Noriega loyalists remained at large. Snipers were spotted
clad in the black uniforms of Panamanian special forces, Sheafer
said.
   He reported sporadic fighting, saying ``people on the tops of
buildings are the kind of thing I'm talking about.'' Snipers were
reported at the Caracol Hotel in the city.
   U.S. intelligence was tracking dozens of reported sightings of
Noriega, the rate of which increased sharply after the Americans
offered a $1 million reward for him, said Williams.
   The Pentagon believes Noriega still is in Panama, despite
reports that he had fled to Colombia, the Dominican Republic or
Mexico, said Sheafer.
   The lives of American hostages became a prime concern for U.S.
forces as the fighting died down. Williams said there were reports
of an unknown number of Americans being held in separate incidents.
   U.S. troops freed 29 Americans and 35 foreign nationals, mostly
Panamanians, from the Marriott Hotel in Panama City late Wednesday
night, but Williams said a list of the evacuees was not available.
   Overall, 35,000 U.S. citizens live in Panama, and ``there are
Americans scattered throughout the city,'' said Williams.

   Pentagon officials fear actions by Noriega
loyalists _ taking Americans hostage, perhaps, or attacking the
Panama Canal _ could force U.S. troops to transform their
``mop-up'' operation into a long-term guerrilla engagement.
   The nation's military leaders were looking at Thursday's Day 2
of ``Operation Just Cause'' as crucial in the battle for control of
the Central American nation, said one high-level military official.
   The fear is that unless Manuel Antonio Noriega's supporters are
captured and disarmed, they could continue to threaten Panamanian
citizens and the lives of the 35,000 Americans living in the
country, or at the very least offer a serious disruption to any
return to normalcy at the canal and elsewhere, officials said.
   ``This is a key day because it will determine whether the
Panamanian Defense Forces and the dignity battalions are
consolidating, or whether they remain as pockets of resistance that
can be cut out and neutralized,'' said the highly placed officer,
who spoke on condition he not be identified by name.
   Asked how long he believed the strike force of thousands of U.S.
troops will remain in the country, the official said, ``I don't
think anybody here knows.''
   Remarking that the forces were going house-to-house in their
efforts to clean out the remaining Noriega loyalists in Panama City
_ and could be forced to search the countryside in search of the
deposed general _ the official said, ``It's not just a mop-up
operation anymore.''
   Asked if U.S. military units might well be facing a protracted
guerrilla battle in urban and country areas in their search for
Noriega, the official answered, ``Yes. It very well may be.''
   President Bush, asked at a session with reporters whether he
believed the intervention would become a guerrilla operation, said,
``I don't think so,'' adding that Noriega has been stripped of his
communications capabilities and the support of military forces that
would allow him to mount an opposition in the countryside.
   ``He hasn't been in a jungle in a long time. And it's tough
living, and he's been living high off the hog, off the Panamanian
people. And so we don't expect'' a kind of mountain guerrilla
organization to arise reminiscent of that led by Cuba's Fidel
Castro in the 1950s, Bush said.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in a separate session with
reporters, said that while major resistance from the Panamanian
military had ended, he could not ``rule out any possibility'' of
such things as terrorist attacks.
   ``It's still a situation in which there is ongoing conflict and
firefights,'' said Cheney said, acknowledging the possibility of
individual terrorist strikes and the taking of U.S. hostages.
   ``Clearly, we haven't resolved all the potential situations
where there may be Americans being held,'' Cheney said. ``We are
aggressively working every one of those cases,'' he said in
comments to a group of news service and newspaper reporters.
   At a public briefing on Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams struck a positive note, saying that ``the organized
resistance ... has ceased at this point'' and that the ``objective
of the day'' was to support the establishment of a democratic
government under the newly sworn and U.S.-supported president,
Guillermo Endara.
   Williams did acknowledge, however, that there was ``some
conflict continuing'' with some members of the Noriega's ``dignity
battalions'' _ the his armed supporters in civil garb _ that remain
in Panama City.
   At the briefing, Army Gen. Tom Kelly, the joint staff's director
of operations, advised reporters that there was no time estimate
available for when the increased U.S. forces might withdraw.
   ``We don't have a time line,'' Kelly said. ``They will be there
until the job is done.''
   Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, who also briefed reporters, said U.S.
military officials still think Noriega is inside Panamanian borders.
   ``We believe he is in the country,'' Sheafer said.
   On Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis., expressed concern
over a long-term engagement.
   ``If there is a beginning, middle and end to American military
involvement it is far better than having this thing dragging out
over weeks and months,'' Kasten said.
   Another senior Pentagon official, who also spoke privately, said
he was confident that the specialized U.S. military units on
Noriega's trail will ultimately be successful.
   ``It may take some time,'' he said, ``But they'll get him.''
   ``Noriega is noisy, blustery, and has such a big ego that it is
nearly impossible for him to travel incognito,'' the official said.
   The official said that the U.S. intervention force will be able
to sustain itself easily over the long term, if a lengthy presence
is necessary, because of the well-organized U.S. base of operations
that has been in place for decades in Panama.

<HEAD>Pinochet Refuses to Relinquish Army Command</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Patricio Aylwin met on Thursday with
Augusto Pinochet, whom he will replace as president in March, and
said the general refused to give up command of the army.
   After the 50-minute meeting, the civilian president-elect told
reporters he asked Pinochet to consider relinquishing the command,
which he cannot be forced to do under the constitution his military
regime wrote in 1980.
   ``I thought it my duty to let him know I considered it
preferable that he not make use'' of the special constitutional
provisions, Aylwin said. ``He told me the opposite.''
   ``The issue was left pending for another conversation,'' Aylwin
said. When asked whether he thought Pinochet would change his mind,
the president-elect said: ``You'll have to ask him.''
   Aylwin, a 71-year-old moderate Christian Democrat supported by a
17-party coalition, won a landslide victory in elections Dec. 14
and will take office March 11th with a new civiilian Congress.
   He said several other issues were discussed in Thursday's
meeting at the presidential palace, including a bill prepared by
the ruling junta that would give the military virtual autonomy
under civilian rule.
   Pinochet, 74, made no immediate comment, but Interior Minister
Carlos Caceres, who was present at the meeting, gave an account
similar to Aylwin's.
   The general seized power in September 1973, overthrowing
President Salvador Allende, an elected Marxist who died in the
coup. He was forced to call elections when voters rejected a
referendum proposal last year that his presidency be extended to
1997.
   According to Aylwin, Pinochet said his remaining as commander
was ``the best guarantee of the army's loyalty to the constitution
and the future government.''
   Thursday's meeting was the first known direct conversation since
the coup between Pinochet and any leading critic of his
authoritarian rule.
   About 2,000 Aylwin supporters waited outside the palace for his
arrival and chanted, ``Give it to him hard!'' as the
president-elect entered the building.
   When some government officials peered through trough gtrgout of
windowsped out palace windows, the crowd waved and shouted, ``Go
away, Pinochet!'' and ``The dictatorship will fall!''
   Aylwin said he and Pinochet they discussed a proposed Armed
Forces Law that would bar the new government from cutting the
defense budget, limit its influence in promotion of officers and
allow the military to decide on arms purchases without government
approval.
   The four-man military junta that acts as a legislature under
Pinochet has yet to approve the legislation.
   Pinochet invited him to prepare written comments on the Armed
Forces Law and other issues, ``then our people and people from the
government would debate their differences and look for reasonable
solutions,'' Aylwin said.

   A federal judge Thursday declared a mistrial
after jurors failed to reach a verdict in the case of a teen-ager
accused of selling the cocaine that President Bush used as a prop
in a nationally televised address on drugs in September.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stanley Sporkin scheduled a new trial
o begin Jan. 8 in the criminal case of Keith Jackson, who is
accused of selling cocaine to an undercover agent in Lafayette Park
across the street from the White House. Jackson, 18, also is
accused of distributing crack at a mall and twice near a high
school.
   The transactions allegedly took place starting last April 24 and
ending Sept. 1 with the sale in Lafayette Park,
   ``We the jury cannot agree on any of the charges,'' the 12
jurors said in a note to Sporkin after four days of deliberations.
   In preparing for Bush's Sept. 5 speech about the war on drugs,
White House aides decided to have the president hold up a bag of
crack and arrangements were made to have a drug purchase near the
White House.
   At Jackson's trial, his attorney, Charles Stow, brought out that
a Drug Enforcement Administration agent at the scene of the
Lafayette Park transaction wore a body microphone that didn't work.
   A camerman who was supposed to videotape the deal was unable to
do so because he was assaulted by a homeless person, a fact which
elicited laughter from the jurors.
   During the courtroom testimony, Sporkin observed that ``this is
like a Keystone Kops thing.''
   DEA officials have said they had difficulty getting Jackson to
come to Lafayette Park because he didn't know where the White House
was.
   In closing arguments, assistant U.S. attorney Mark Carroll said
Stow ``has tried to nit-pick'' and said the four crack sales for
which Jackson is accused did take place.

<HEAD>Military Says Re-establishing Law and Order Top Priority</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: This story was filed by reporters in a pool taken to Panama
by the Pentagon.</HEAD>

   Re-establishing law and order in
Panama is the next objective of the U.S. military but the capture
of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga remains a priority, a top military
planner said Thursday.
   ``As long as Noriega is floating around, there are going to be
some people who will not accept'' the government of President
Guillermo Endara, said Lt. Col. Bill Bennett.
   ``We want to capture this guy and get him to Miami,'' Bennett
said. ``There are ongoing efforts to locate General _ I'm sorry,
Mr. _ Noriega.''
   Bennett, chief of contingency plans for the U.S. Southern
Command in Panama, said he could not estimate the strength of
remaining forces loyal to Noriega but that they remain mostly in
outlying towns where U.S. troops have yet to go.
   ``We've got to re-establish law and order throughout Panama
City,'' Bennett said.
   The plan, he said, is to identify leaders who will be loyal to
the Endara government and then get a Panamanian police force in
action.
   ``We are interested in doing what the Endara government will
(need to) succeed,'' Bennett told reporters.
   There are about 1,500 U.S. military police already in Panama
with another 1,500 en route to ``help with law and order,'' Bennett
said.
   Bennett predicted that more Panamanian military units that
``have been sitting on the fence'' will soon support the Endara
government.
   ``But that is where the capture of Noriega does become
important,'' he said. ``We don't want to give them any sort of
cause to rally to the other side.''

<HEAD>Group Declares Opposition in Soviet Congress</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading reformer said Thursday that scores of
members of the Congress of People's Deputies have been forced into
opposition by the majority's unwillingness to press reforms.
   The declaration by historian Yuri N. Afanasyev was a
watered-down version of a statement first debated a week ago by the
Inter-Regional Deputies Group, proclaiming a ``political
opposition'' to the Communist Party and government. Still, it set
the 2,250-member Congress on a stormy debate.
   Afanasyev called for an end to the Communist Party's monopoly on
power, and criticized the congress for failing to take up key
questions of economic reform.
   ``We are in the opposition to the decisions of the Congress,''
Afanasyev said. ``We can't agree with indefinite postponement of
the passage of the most important laws.''
   The Inter-Regional Group failed on the opening day of the
Congress Dec. 12 to place on the agenda the party's constitutional
role as the ``leading and guiding force'' of Soviet society.
   It also failed to put on the agenda a discussion of laws on
land, property, and economic organization.
   Afanasyev said he spoke for at least 130 members of the
Inter-Regional Deputies Group, which includes about 400 Congress
members. The group had included human rights activist Andrei D.
Sakharov, who died last Thursday after attending a meeting in which
the group discussed declaring a formal opposition.
   Svyatoslav Medvedev, a deputy from northern Kazakhstan, charged
in a congress debate that Afanasyev's group ``has started an open
struggle for political power in the country.''
   Afanasyev has said formation of a formal opposition to the
Communist Party and government could be a step toward formation of
an opposition political party.
   He has declared his support for a multiparty system.

   European governments issued new
condemnations Thursday of the bloody repression in Romania and
President Francois Mitterrand of France said the Stalinist regime's
``days are numbered.''
   China said the events in Romania were an internal affair. In
Beijing, the China-Romania Friendship Association opened a
laudatory photographic exhibit called ``Romania in Socialist
Construction.''
   West Germany, Austria, Britain and Hungary requested an urgent
meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
   Javier Perez de Cuellar, the U.N. secretary-general, expressed
``profound anxiety'' about developments in Romania.
   ``It is essential that this situation be handled with scrupulous
respect for the universal Declaration of Human Rights and in
accordance with the U.N. Charter,'' Perez de Cuellar said.
   Britain urged ``all nations'' to condemn ``this behavior, which
is an affront to all internationally accepted norms.''
   Demonstrations against President Nicolae Ceausescu's government
began last weekend in Timisoara, a city in western Romania, and
have spread to other parts of the country, including Bucharest.
   Estimates by witnesses of the number of people killed in
Timisoara range from hundreds to 4,000. Reports from Bucharest said
security forces fired into crowds of protesters in the capital
Thursday, but no precise casualty reports were available.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the U.S. Embassy in Buchrest reported that 13 young people
were killed by automatic weapons fire from government security
forces during the demonstration. He said other fatalities may have
occurred as well.
   Romania's conduct has isolated it from Warsaw Pact allies, where
the trend is toward democracy and economic reform.
   Thousands of people chanting anti-Ceausescu slogans and waving
banners for freedom gathered outside Romanian embassies in Prague,
Budapest and Belgrade, the capitals of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Yugoslavia. Demonstrators burned an effigy of Ceauesescu outside
the Romanian Embassy in Vienna, Austria.
   In Paris, Federico Mayor, the head of the U.N. Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization, summoned Romanian
representative Petre Gigea and reminded him Romania had promised to
uphold human dignity before it was allowed to join UNESCO.
   At the end of the current round of the East-West conventional
arms talks in Vienna, a diplomat expressed concern that the trouble
in Romania could jeopardize negotiations on reducing military
forces in Europe.
   ``It's feared that Hungary and Romania will no longer sit on the
same side of the negotiation table,'' the diplomat said privately.
   Official Soviet reaction was cautious, but coverage of Romania
by the state news agency Tass gave vivid accounts of violence
against demonstrators.
   ``If we do receive information on victims among people we, of
course, will be extremely sorry about them,'' said Vadim Perfiliev,
a spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry.
   ``We should emphasize that we do have opinions on what is
happening, but ... I cannot go into comments without having
all-inclusive information and orders in that regard.''
   On a visit to East Berlin, Mitterrand was more direct.
   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honest
reason to remain,'' he said. ``I think that the days of this
regime, in a Europe in full movement, are numbered.''
   He ruled out foreign intervention amd said: ``The response has
to come from Romania.''
   In Bonn, Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said the
chancellor was ``deeply shocked by the brutal repression of the
justified and peaceful protests. He strongly condemns the massive
use of weapons and the reprehensible attempts by the Romanian
leadership to suppress the efforts for freedom and democracy.''
   Klein said Kohl ``appeals to those responsible at all levels in
Romania to halt repression by the military and security police, and
to open a dialogue on the justified demands of people.''
   In London, the Foreign Office said withdrawing their ambassadors
from Romania was one of several options being considered by the 12
European Community members.
   Italy announced it had recalled its ambassador, Luigi Amaduzzi,
for consultations.
   East Germany condemned the ``brutal action of the Romanian state
power against peaceful citizens demonstrating to assert their
elementary human rights.''
   It urged the Romanian government stop the violence and recalled
Ambassador Herbert Plaschke for consultations.
   Czechoslovakia summoned a senior Romanian diplomat to receive a
protest from the Foreign Ministry in Prague.
   Government and other protests continued in Hungary, which has
tense relations with Ceausescu's regime because of alleged
harassment of the 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in Romania.
   ``There exists or has developed in Romania a serious political
movement,'' said Foreign Minister Gyula Horn. ``It is an
anti-Ceausescu movement. There is no accurate information on its
strength, or the extent to which it has spread.''
   Greece condemned the suppression and the Athens Academy of
Sciences canceled the membership awarded in 1976 to Ceausescu's
wife, Elena, the second most powerful person in Romania.

<HEAD>Panama's Endara Orders Curfew; Makes Appointments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Guillermo Endara on Thursday made
his first appearance in public since being sworn in and announced
an 18-hour-long curfew would go into effect immediately in the face
of widespread looting.
   The order had little initial impact and it was unclear how it
would be enforced. Panama City was a scene of chaos, with thousands
looting stores amid scattered gunfire. No police were seen on the
street.
   Endara said in a speech at the National Assembly building that
he will preside over a government of reconstruction and
reconciliation. He asked Panamanian exiles to return because ``the
military dictatorship has fallen.''
   ``One of first problems that we have to face is the problem of
anarchy and public order that now exists. Because of this I have
ordered the closing for two days, today and tomorrow, of all
private and public establishments,'' Endara said .
   ``With all these measures and other police measures that we will
take, we hope to re-establish public order before Christmas.''
   Although he mentioned two days of closing, the curfew he
proclaimed began at 2 p.m. Thursday and was to expire at 6 a.m.
Friday. He did not say whether it would be extended.
   Endara was sworn in as president early Wednesday morning by a
Panamanian judge in a private ceremony shortly after U.S. troops
attacked Panamanian Defense Forces. The Americans failed in their
effort to seize Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who last May annulled
a presidential election won by Endara.
   Endara said he talked to President Bush by phone and asked him
for immediate, emergency help in ``food and medicine for those who
are injured, hungry and sick.'' He said he was told aid was coming.
   Endara's speech was transmitted over the U.S.-controlled
Patriotic Network for Broadcasting the Truth, the only radio
station on the air. The speech at the National Assembly was
attended by about 200 people, most of them members of political
parties who opposed Noriega.
   U.S. military officials confirmed that Endara had stayed on a
U.S. military base from the time he was sworn in to the assembly
address.
   Endara appointed First Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon as
minister of government and justice, responsible for internal
security. He named Second Vice President Guillermo Ford as minister
of planning and political economy.
   Arias and Ford had been sworn in along with Endara.
   Endara also announced the appointments of Eduardo Vallarino as
ambassador to the United Nations, Lauren Fabrega as ambassador to
the Organization of American States and Carlos Rodriguez as U.S.
ambassador.
   No other appointments were announced, and it was not clear when
he would get around to structuring a government.
   Arias said he was contacting police officials asking them to
return to their jobs. He said he had started contacting some
military ``to offer them an opportunity to define their loyalty to
the people so they can resume their service to fatherland.''
   The police force is part of the Defense Forces, which were in
large measure either resisting the U.S. occupation or were
dispersed by the fighting. It was not clear who would enforce
Endara's order, or any kind of law and order here.
   Also unclear was how much support Endara had among Panamanians,
or the extent of his grip on the government.
   But he emphasized the importance of restoring order to Panama.
   Francisco Rodriguez, who was appointed Noriega's provisional
president after election results were annulled, told reporters
Wednesday, ``We are prepared to resist.''
   Rodriguez was apparently in hiding Thursday.
   In elections held May 7, Endara beat Noriega's handpicked
presidential candidate by a 3-1 margin, according to international
observers. Noriega nullified the results, ignoring the outcry at
home and abroad.
   Endara is a member of the Liberal Authentic Party and ran for
president as the compromise candidate of an eight-party
anti-Noriega alliance.

   American combat soldiers should be withdrawn
from Panama as quickly as possible, members of Congress said
Thursday, but one said some troops should remain as policemen and
could still be there ``on Christmas eve a year from now.''
   Rep. Les. Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said the presence of U.S. soldiers may be required for
an indefinite period if the Panamanian Defense Forces are unable to
perform normal police functions and defend the new democratic
government.
   ``I think the chances are that there is going to be a need for
them to be there,'' Aspin said, adding that police and public
safety operations in Panama appeared to have broken down.
   Manuel Antonio Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces performed
many police functions as well as military ones. Their headquarters
was the main target of the first U.S. assault.
   Aspin said of some U.S. troops: ``I do see a need for them to
stay. I would not be surprised to see them there on Christmas eve a
year from now.''
   He said that American combat troops were withdrawn from Grenada
two months after the U.S. intervention there but that military
police units were not removed until 18 months later.
   Other members of Congress said there is a pressing need to move
far faster in Panama.
   Rep. Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, said ``the most negative situation'' would
exist if in 24 hours Noriega _ now a fugitive with a $1 million
reward offered for his capture _ was holding hostages, or if
fighting lasted beyond 24 to 48 hours.
   ``I'd say if we have any kind of significant ongoing hostilities
or ongoing hostage situation where Noriega has some leverage, it's
going to be an extremely tense time for the Americans,'' he said.
   Aspin agreed that a combination of an uncaptured Noriega, a
faltering government, attacks on Americans and sporadic sniper fire
could change positive perceptions of the U.S. action.
   ``You could have this thing turn real sour for George Bush real
quick,'' Aspin said.
   McCloskey said, ``I backed President Bush and the necessity to
make a military move on Noriega, given the violence against our own
military personnel and dependents. As in any situation things go
wrong in the implementation.
   ``I just hope they are supersensitive to concerns for civilian
casualties, both Americans and Panamanians,'' McCloskey said.
   Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass, another committee member, said
there are several positive aspects in the present situation in
Panama.
   ``Noriega is not administering the affairs of the government of
Panama, that is the key factor,'' he said. ``I think Noriega's
input into the affairs of Panama is at an end.''
   ``If we can firm up the new government, make that government
secure, then the special forces have to come out of there,''
Mavroules said.
   He said that if U.S. forces remain _ and their stay is seen as
long-term or indefinite _ the governments of Latin America would be
``extremely upset to see any American military outside of the U.S.
bases.''
   ``That's why it's important they get out, and that they get out
just as quickly, just as soon as possible,'' Mavroules said.
   ``But I can't place any time limit on that,'' the congressman
said.
   Much congressional comment has been supportive of Bush's action
in sending thousands of troops against Noriega and his forces.
However, there has been criticism, too.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., said, ``As much as we support
Tuesday's U.S. military action in Panama, we should remember ...
that Noriega himself is the toxic waste of a polluted Reagan-Bush
foreign policy.''
   ``Noriega was A-OK as long as he did our bidding and supported
assistance to the Contras in Nicaragua,'' she said. ``It didn't
matter if he murdered Panamanians or peddled cocaine.''
   Meanwhile, the chairman of a subcommittee that controls foreign
aid said the new government should call elections to revalidate its
popular support in the face of criticism that it is a
U.S.-installed regime.
   ``The new Panamanian government ... will have difficulty
establishing credibility throughout Latin America unless it
immediately announces that it regards itself as a temporary
government and will guarantee a new election next year,'' Rep.
David Obey, D-Wis., said in a letter to Bush.
   Elections would mute criticism and ``could create a much more
stable situation in Panama than would otherwise be the case,'' said
Obey, chairman of the House Appropriations foreign operations
subcommittee.

   The Nicaraguan military stationed two tanks
near the U.S. Embassy in Managua on Thursday after U.S. troops in
Panama City surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies, American
officials said.
   The officials said the turrets of the Nicaraguan tanks were
turned away from the Embassy, adding that there was no indication
hostile action was contemplated.
   U.S. troops were sent to the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies in
Panama City after rumors spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
may have fled there during the U.S. military invasion.
   If the Nicaraguan tanks do nothing to disrupt embassy operations
in Managua , ``there is not anything we would want to do to
escalate'' the situation, said one official, who asked not to be
identified.
   Otherwise, the administration will give ``deep consideration''
on how to respond, he said.
   U.S. diplomats told Nicaraguan authorities they saw no reason
for the tank deployment, but the Nicaraguans said the deployment
was in response to U.S. activities in Panama.
   The Americans replied that no hostilities were planned against
the Sandinista embassy in Panama.

<HEAD>United States Has A Cold First Day Of Winter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Winter left no doubt about its arrival Thursday as it continued
to pour arctic air out of Canada, setting record low temperatures
in at least 17 U.S. cities.
   Morning lows were colder than 20 degrees below zero from
northwest upper Michigan through the Dakotas to northeastern
Montana, and plunged more than 30 degrees below zero in western
North Dakota and northeastern Montana.
   Strong northerly winds brought wind chill readings to as low as
80 degrees below zero.
   The latest northerly flow of air out of Canada and the arctic
regions brought the coldest weather of the season to the
north-central United States, where at least 17 cities reported new
record low temperatures for the date Thursday morning.
   Montana, Havre, reported a record-setting low of 43 degrees
below zero, breaking a 105-year-old record.Chicago set a new record
with a minus 13, colder than in 1872, when the previous record of
12 below zero was set.
   Readings dipped below zero fom the northern and central High
Plains to the upper Great Lakes, and the frigid air was ushered
deep into the heart of Texas.
   Numerous record lows were likely to be established east of the
Rockies by Friday night, and before the cold wave ends many parts
of the country may experience their coldest night of record, the
National Weather Service siad.
   Afternoon temperatures were below zero across the northern and
central Plains region and the middle and upper Mississippi Valley,
and the the subzero cold is entering the Great Lakes region.
   Afternoon readings were colder than 20 degrees below zero in the
Dakotas and eastern Montana, with readings still near 40 degrees
below zero in north- central Montana.
   Strong northerly winds produced squalls with heavy snow in the
Great Lakes region. In western New York state, the town of Pulaski
was buried under four feet of snow in one night. Two feet of snow
was reported at Barnes Corners, N.Y.
   Snow generated by the cold front blew across much of the High
Plains and parts of the central Rocky Mountain region, the Ohio
Valley and the central Appalachian region in the afternoon.
   Sunny skies and seasonable temperatures prevailed across much of
the West, with the Rocky Mountain range serving as kind of a
protective barrier from the arctic invasion into the central and
eastern United States.

   French President Francois Mitterrand urged
closer links between East Germany and Western Europe, but said
Thursday that rash moves toward German unity should be avoided
   Mitterrand met Communist premier Hans Modrow and other political
leaders to express the West's concerns about the possibility of
German unification.
   The two countries signed six agreements, including an economic
and industrial cooperation accord for 1990-94 as well as one on
youth exchanges.
   The French president also discussed cooperation between his
Socialist Party and the East German Communist Party.
   At the Brandenburg Gate, work on creating two pedestrian
crossings immediately north and south of the gate began at 10 p.m.
East German workers used a crane to lift a section of the rounded
top of the wall, then began working on opening the two crossing
points.
   More than 1,000 people on the Western side cheered and set off
firecrackers as work began under floodlights.
   Mitterrand drove by the gate on the eastern side and briefly got
out of his car to look at it shortly before the work began.
   He told the students in Leipzig, the birthplace of the
pro-democracy movement, that ``France set conditions but not a
veto'' on German unification.
   ``German unity is first and foremost an affair for Germans.
France will not stand in the way,'' he said.
   ``Only free, open, democratic elections will permit us to know
exactly what the Germans on the two sides want,'' Mitterrand said
in replies to questions posed by some of the 600 students of
Leipzig's Karl Marx University.
   ``But the German people must take the European balance into
account in its decision,'' he added.
   Since a peaceful people's revolution forced the ouster of the
former hard-line Communist leadership, a growing number of East
Germans have called for quick German reunification.
   In recent weeks, demonstrators at traditional Monday rallies in
Leipzig have carried West German flags and shouted for German unity.
   With World War II memories still fresh in many minds, European
leaders have cautioned against quick unification and its
consequences for postwar stability in Europe.
   Mitterrand said a written treaty could not wipe out ``European
realities created after World War II.''
   Mitterrand arrived in East Berlin on Wednesday a few hours after
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl departed.
   Kohl and Modrow announced the two countries expected to conclude
a treaty broadly expanding bilateral cooperation in the spring.
   The treaty will provide for practical steps to establish close
links between West Germany and East Germany in many areas.
   Kohl also urged East Germans to be patient about unification,
saying the process could not come overnight and that Germans had to
consider security implications of such a move.
   Meanwhile, a leader of the New Forum opposition group warned
that the 200,000-strong movement faced a growing rift.
   Rolf Henrich, a co-founder of New Forum, said the group's
members were divided on whether to constitute the movement as a
political party or leave it as a loose organization.
   Mitterrand also urged the ouster of Nicolae Ceausescu's
hard-line Communist leadership in Romania, where security forces
have reportedly shot and killed hundreds and possibly thousands of
anti-government demonstrators.
   ``It is a regime of personal, family power that has no honest
reason to remain,'' Mitterrand said during a meeting with East
German students in Leipzig. ``I think that the days of this regime,
in a Europe in full movement, are numbered.''

largest cocaine producer, to cancel in protest of the U.S. assault
on Panama, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday.
   Peru issued a strongly worded statement Wednesday condeming the
use of force in Panama, recalling its ambassador from Washington
and calling for a postponement of the scheduled Feb. 15 summit. It
did not offer an alternative date.
   The other countries scheduled to attend the meeting are Colombia
and Bolivia. Both those nations issued statements condeming the
U.S. actions in Panama but did not mention the drug summit.
   Bush has said he will go to Cartagena, Colombia as a show of
support for President Virgilio Barco, whose nation has been at war
with drug lords.
   The assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs,
Bernard Aronson, traveled to Peru earlier this month for a meeting
with Peruvian President Alan Garcia to outline the drug summit
agenda. Bush has proposed $2.2 billion over the next five years for
the three Andean nations to fight drugs.
   Earlier this week there were rumors that the Colombian drug
leaders have taken out a $30 million contract on Bush's life.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Princess Diana's brother and his wife said in a
television program broadcast Thursday that Britain's tabloid
newspapers harassed them and fabricated stories in the weeks before
they were married Sept. 16.
   Viscount Althorp, 25, and his wife, the former Victoria
Lockwood, 24, said events and remarks attributed to them were
manufactured.
   In an interview on ``Hard News,'' a Channel 4 television program
about the news industry, Viscountess Althorp said tabloid
journalists harassed her and her friends and invaded their privacy.
   ``I think they're really totally insensitive, evil, evil
people,'' she said. ``I don't know how they go home to their wives
and children and talk about their day with a clear conscience and
have any self-esteem or self-respect.''
   Viscount Althorp, who works as a reporter for the NBC-TV show
``Today'' as Charles Althorp, said of the tabloid reporters: ``They
were not content with the story as it stood. They wanted to make it
juicier, nastier.
   ``Everyday people are bruised by the press and they haven't got
any recourse to speak out, and I am doing this because I think I
ought to and because I am in the position to do so.''
   His wife criticized a cover story in the Sunday Mirror of Sept.
10, on which the headline was ``Charlie's Bride in Sexy Clinch with
Ex-Lover.''
   ``If I were going to smooch with an ex-flame, I certainly
wouldn't do it in a nightclub in front of everybody,'' she said.
   A spokesman for Maxwell Communications, which owns the Sunday
Mirror, said company officials had not seen the program and could
not comment until they had done so.
   Althorp said he once found a photographer hiding in bushes
beside his house when he and Miss Lockwood were outdoors.
   ``We had a drink on the lawn and I heard this clicking from a
bush at the end of the garden,'' he said. ``So I raced there and I
hauled out this photographer who was weighed down with cameras.''
   Darius Guppy, the couple's best man, said a News of the World
journalist tried to get him to agree that the bachelor night party
``degenerated into an orgy.''
   ``They were interested in inventing a story that would
compromise Lord Althorp, which I think was unforgivable,'' he said.
   Stuart Kuttner, the News of the World managing editor, said his
paper was interested in covering the Althorp engagement and
wedding, but ``the allegation that the paper was interested in
inventing a story that would compromise Lord Althorp is utterly
without foundation.''
   ``Indeed, the claim does not bear examination, since to invent,
without foundation, a compromising story would expose the paper to
the risk of legal proceedings which it would be unable to defend,''
Kuttner said. ``In short, this serious charge is wholly rejected.''

<HEAD>Bush: U.S. Troops to Stay `As Long as It Takes'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 10th graf: ``The Pentagon,'' with latest casualty figures,
21 deaths, 208 wounded</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush vowed Thursday that American
troops would scour Panama ``as long as it takes'' to capture Manuel
Antonio Noriega. He said the loss of American lives in the military
action ``has been worth it'' and called the U.S. commitment
open-ended.
   Expressing sorrow over the deaths, Bush said ``military
casualties are a burden which a nation must endure and all
presidents have to face up to, but which we can never accept.''
   Several congressmen called for the troops to be brought home
quickly, though one _ Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee _ said some might have to remain as policemen
until ``Christmas eve a year from now.''
   Bush said the operation was ``open-ended as far as going after
Noriega, open-ended as far as restoration of order in Panama.''
   A day after ordering 9,500 fighting men into Panama, to join
more than 13,000 already stationed there, Bush said the military
mission ``is not over, but pretty well wrapped up.''
   U.S. forces encountered sporadic firing in Panama City but were
reported in control of several key points in the city, including
the legislative building, said Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams.
   Officials said most units of Noriega's Panamanian Defense Forces
had fled into the jungles, and that U.S. troops may be ordered to
follow them.
   Bush said that with Noriega on the run and a new president,
Guillermo Endara, in place, ``the government is beginning to
function and the man (Noriega) controls no forces. And he's out.
But, yes, I won't be satisfied until we see him come to justice.''
   Bush made his remarks at a White House news conference at the
very hour a military aircraft arrived in Dover, Del., bearing the
bodies of some of the Americans killed in Panama.
   The Pentagon said 21 troops had been killed in action, 208 were
wounded and one was missing.
   In addition, an American civilian, Candy Helin, 43, was killed.
A schoolteacher of gifted children at a U.S. government school in
Panama, she was killed by stray fire from the Panamanian Defense
Forces, officials said.
   Military hospitals in San Antonio, Texas, reported they were
treating about 190 troops evacuated from Panama, a higher count
than reported at the Pentagon.
   Asked if the attempt to catch Noriega had been worth the loss of
life, Bush said, ``I have to answer: Yes, it has been worth it.''
   U.S. officials said 59 Panamanian soldiers had been killed and
66 wounded. Army Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly said U.S. troops had taken
1,500 prisoners, most of them regulars from the Panamanian Defense
Force.
   Bush said 11 people said to have been abducted by Panamanian
troops from a Smithsonian research facility had been freed.
   However, Williams, the Pentagon spokesman, said there were other
reports of an unknown number of Americans being held in three
separate incidents.
   The Pentagon said the U.S. offer of a $1 million bounty for
Noriega had prompted many calls but no results.
   ``We've had a lot of nibbles,'' said Rear Adm. Ted Sheafer, an
intelligence specialist for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   ``Suddenly the number of reports on his location has gone up
dramatically,'' he said. ``A lot of it turns out to be very bogus.''
   Bush said, ``That's $1 million bucks I'd be very happy to sign
the check for,'' and he joked that Noriega's wanted poster ``will
be in every post office in town.''
   Noriega is under indictment in the United States on drug charges.
   The general dropped from sight and eluded capture as American
troops landed in Panama.
   ``The good news _ he's out of power,'' Bush said. ``The bad news
_ he has not yet been brought to justice. ... There is a certain
level of frustration on that account.''
   Bush said, ``I won't be satisfied until we see him come to
justice.''
   Asked how long he would chase Noriega, Bush said, ``As long as
it takes.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had suggested that some elements
of the U.S. force might be withdrawn by Christmas, although the
White House later suggested that might be overly optimistic.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We
certainly aren't willing to give a timetable to it. But everyone
recognizes this is not going to be a case of going in Wednesday and
coming out Thursday.
   ``The new government doesn't have an easy task,'' Fitzwater said
at his own news briefing. ``Don't look for results overnight.''
   Bush used the word ``invade'' to refer to the U.S. operation in
Panama but caught himself and changed it to ``send in those troops
down into Panama.''
   He acknowledged that he had changed course from October, when he
was criticized for not supporting or joining the effort by
Panamanian officers to overthrow Noriega.
   The president said, ``I think what changed my mind was ... the
death of the Marine, brutalizing, really obscene torture of the
Navy lieutenant and the threat of sexual abuse and the terror
inflicted on that Navy lieutenant's wife, the declaration of war by
Noriega.''
   Bush said he needs to spell out those incidents to Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose government has criticized the
intervention.
   Bush said that with instances of harassment and death, ``Mr.
Gorbachev, please understand this president is going to do
something about it.''
   Meanwhile, Fitzwater said Bush still anticipates attending a
Feb. 15 drug summit with Latin American leaders in Cartagena,
Colombia, even though Peru's president, Alan Garcia, pulled his
ambassador from Washington in protest of the Panamanian
intervention and called for postponing the summit.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Islamic
fundamentalists, many of them women, gathered Thursday near the
National Assembly to demonstrate for ``the dignity of Islamic
women.''
   The rally was intended as a reply to a recent spontaneous
demonstration of women at the site to protest Islamic extremism and
demand the strict application of Algeria's Constitution calling for
equality of the sexes.
   Many of those at the peaceful gathering were women, with their
heads covered by traditional Islamic scarves. Islam is the official
religion of this North African country.
   About 10,000 demonstrators who rallied earlier were joined by
hundreds of thousands of others, strictly separated according to
gender. They blocked streets leading to the government building.
   Police looked on but no violence was reported. Loudspeakers
broadcast verses from the Koran, the Moslem holy book. Banners
praised Islamic law as the only moral guide and declared that women
should be honored to wear the hijab, the traditional scarf covering
head, neck and ears.
   It was the largest demonstration by women in Algeria since the
country gained independence from France in 1962.
   The National Assembly, meanwhile, adopted a ban on political
demonstrations at sites reserved for religious purposes.
   The fundamentalists, who control most of the 8,000 Algerian
mosques, have increasingly used their sermons to denounce the
``westernization'' of Algerian society and the decline of strict
Islamic values.

<HEAD>Western Creditors May Advance Yugoslavia Up to $4 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DUSAN STOJANOVIC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western creditors may lend
Yugoslavia up to $4 billion in the next two years if it adopts
Premier Ante Markovic's new market-oriented economic program,
sources and press reports said Thursday.
   Yugoslav banking sources told The Associated Press the
International Monetary Fund agreed to grant Yugoslavia an 18-month
stand-by credit worth $600 million. The loan, once fully approved
by IMF authorities, will be available from Jan. 1, 1990.
   Yugoslavia hopes the IMF will increase that to $900 million for
a two-year period, said sources close to the negotiations, which
ended in Belgrade this week.
   The newspaper Vecernje Novosti said Yugoslavia now has a shot at
obtaining additional Western credits, because commercial banks and
governments usually follow the IMF lead in gauging whether to keep
supporting a debtor country.
   It quoted National Bank Vice Gov. Zarko Trbojevic as saying the
World Bank, the European Community, the IMF and the European Free
Trade Association have already agreed to grant Yugoslavia a total
of $3 billion in new credits.
   Italy, Japan and Canada have also ``given guarantees'' to supply
Yugoslavia with additional loans worth about $1 billion in the next
two years if Markovic's reform package is put into effect, Vecernje
Novosti said.
   The money would be used mainly for importing new Western
technology and restructuring Yugoslavia's economy and its banking
system, which is being reformed in accordance with Western
standards, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   They said money was needed to prop up banks that have been
backing money-losing ventures that would lose government subsidies
under market-oriented reforms.
   Markovic has apparently won a battle in Parliament against
conservatives who oppose his efforts to introduce market mechanisms
into the economy _ now burdened by a 2,000 percent inflation rate,
a $17 billion foreign debt and a 17 percent unemployment rate.
   His reform package calls for compulsory shutdown of all
money-losing firms, wide introduction of private and foreign
investments, wage freezes and tight monetary and budgetary controls.
   Yugoslavia on Wednesday became the first communist country to
introduce convertible currency when part of Markovic's program was
adopted in parliament.
   Communist leaders in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic,
oppose Markovic's efforts to restructure the state-run economy and
promote greater political pluralism, but his measures are likely to
be adopted despite the opposition.
   About 650,000 workers held a half-hour warning strike in
Belgrade, the capital, on Wednesday to protest planned austerity
measures, Tanjug news agency reported.

   Czechoslovkia's new government has
taken the first steps toward normalizing diplomatic relations with
Israel after a 22-year break, a deputy premier said Thursday.
   Valtr Komarek told reporters the Cabinet had ``discussed the
preparations for negotiations over diplomatic relations with South
Korea and Israel.''
   Czechoslovakia and most other Soviet bloc nations, with the
exception of Romania, broke diplomatic ties with Israel in 1967
during the Middle East war.
   Israel and Czechoslovakia under its former hard-line Communist
leaders discussed the possiblity of restoring ties last year, but
the talks failed to produce results.
   Komarek said the new government planned to resume negotiations.
   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier ``is to prepare concrete
measures and proposals for the negotiations,'' Komarek said.
   Czechoslovakia's new non-Communist dominated government, swept
into power by a peaceful pro-democracy revolution, was sworn in
Dec. 10.

<HEAD>Threatening Letters Sent to Two Mail Bomb Targets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two of the four targets of mailed bombs
have been sent follow-up letters, apparently from the same person,
threatening further action, federal investigators said Thursday.
   Officials would not reveal where the letters were sent or their
contents.
   The four targets of the bombs were federal Judge Robert S.
Vance; his court, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta; Savannah attorney Robert Robinson; and the Jacksonville,
Fla., NAACP.
   Vance was killed in his suburban Birminham, Ala., home Saturday
when a nail-studded bomb exploded; Robinson was killed in his
office by a bomb Monday. The packages sent to the court and the
NAACP office were defused safely.
   ``There have been follow-up letters sent since receipt of the
bomb parcels,'' said Leo Shatzel, a postal inspector in Atlanta.
``It appears they may have been sent by the individual who sent the
parcels.''
   Shatzel said the letters ``were threatening additional mailings
to other individuals.'' But asked if the letters specifically
threatened further bombings, he replied simply, ``No.''
   Shatzel and FBI officials said a number of letters have come to
their attention in the wake of the bombings, including the two sent
to targets.
   William Hinshaw, head of the FBI's Atlanta agency, said none of
the letters specifically claim responsibility for the bombings on
behalf of a person or group, or describe exactly the details of the
four bombing attempts.
   Hinshaw said the letters were not sent before the bombings,
which might corroborate a link between the letter-senders and the
bombings.
   Shatzel said investigators ``have to assume there may be a
relationship'' between this week's letters and letters sent in
August, to a Jackson, Miss., TV station and other parties,
threatening the 11th Circuit Court _ which, as Hinshaw noted
Thursday, does not handle Mississippi cases.
   The latest letters ``may be a hoax. They may be from other
persons,'' Shatzel said. But ``they may be from an individual who
did send a bomb.''
   All four packages have been linked to civil rights court cases:
Vance and other 11th Circuit judges have handled school
desegregation and other civil rights cases from Georgia, Alabama
and Florida; the Jacksonville NAACP recently won a school
desegregation case in the Atlanta court; and Robinson had
represented the Savannah NAACP in a school desegregation case.
   Hinshaw said that while no bombs have been discovered in the
past two days, investigators dare not assume the attacks are over.
A bomb threat was called in Thursday to a Birmingham, Ala.,
building housing two bankruptcy judges and the Internal Revenue
Service but no explosive was found.
   ``We're fortunate today we didn't turn up any more bombs _ knock
on wood,'' he said, speaking with reporters at a news conference
with postal authorities and Georgia law enforcement officials.
``But we can't say this person's stopped.''
   FBI spokesman Diader Rosario in Atlanta said agents have
interviewed everyone whose name appeared on the four parcels, but
``we do not consider them suspects or involved in any way, shape or
form.''
   FBI officials have said at least three of the bombs were mailed
in Georgia _ in Newnan, Atlanta and Macon _ and all four had
Georgia return addresses. The package to Robinson may have been
mailed in Macon as well, but officials said the postmark on that
bomb was damaged or blurred.
   A Macon attorney, Charles A. Mathis, said Wednesday the FBI had
questioned one of his associates about a 14-year-old racial
discrimination case against the Air Force as part of the bombing
investigation.
   Mathis declined to name the associate or detail what he was
asked. The Macon firm's clients won a $3.75 million settlement in
the case, which involved Robins Air Force Base in Warner Robins and
had been before the 11th Circuit.

<TEXT>
   One of two teen-agers allegedly
induced to gamble by staffers of a ``tabloid'' TV show testified
Thursday that he was offered free food and lodging for his
participation, but never got it.
   City prosecutor Steve Smoger said the charges of inducing a
teen-ager to gamble are the first such case to be prosecuted since
casino gaming was approved for Atlantic City in 1977.
   In an effort to convict the two staffers from ``Hard Copy,' a
nationally syndicated TV news show, Smoger said he offered a plea
bargain to Andrew Pearlstein and Jeff Gerson, both 19 and from
Cherry Hill.
   The youths pleaded guilty Thursday to charges of falsifying an
application on a driver's license and were fined $250 each.
   Smoger said the underage gambling charges Pearlstein and Gerson
face could be reduced after the resolution of the case against
``Hard Copy'' producer Ellen Gussenberg and reporter Daphne
Pinkerson.
   Ms. Gussenberg and Ms. Pinkerson face disorderly persons charges
_ an offense that carries up to a year in jail and a $2,000 fine.
   The staffers work as ``field directors,'' developing stories by
finding people to interview, said Jane Yollin, a spokeswoman for
the show.
   Under cross-examinatin by Ms. Guttenberg's attorney, Carl D.
Poplar, Pearlstein said he and a friend didn't got a free room or
food from ``Hard Copy,'' but he believed that Ms. Gussenberg
offered them over the telephone.
   Pearlstein, who was on the stand for more than an hour, said his
testimony was not influenced by a lawsuit he is contemplating
against Ms. Gussenberg and Ms. Pinkerson.
   John Maroccia, attorney for Pearlstein and Gerson, said he would
decide on the lawsuit in 30 days.
   The two youths were arrested Aug. 18 for allegedly gambling at
TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort.
   Under questioning by Smoger, Pearlstein said Ms. Pinkerson
called him in July after a friend of his sister suggested he might
be a good person to contact.
   The friend, Jennifer Denmark, 21, of Cherry Hill, testified
earlier that Ms. Gussenberg identified herself as being from MTV
when she approached her earlier in the month at Bally's Grand Hotel
&amp; Casino.
   Ms. Denmark, crying on the stand, said she believed Ms.
Gussenberg wanted to do a feature on youths at the Jersey shore in
the summer. But under cross-examination, Ms. Denmark said, ``Part
of the conversation dealt with underage gambling.''
   Pearlstein said he drove Aug. 18 from Cherry Hill to Atlantic
City with Gerson because the idea of a television interview
appealed to him and because several phone calls from Ms. Pinkerson
led him to feel sorry for her.
   ``I didn't completely blow her off in the beginning,'' he said.
``She was very nice to me and I felt bad for her.
   ``She seemed very persistent and had trouble finding people''
for the show, he said.
   After their arrest by casino security, Pearlstein said he told
state police that they were part of the television program. He said
he then called Ms. Gussenberg.
   ``I said to her that we got arrested and we need you to ... come
and take us out,'' Pearlstein said. ``She never came.''
   The trial is expected to resume either Jan. 8 or Jan. 9 with
continued testimony by Pearlstein and Gerson taking the stand,
Smoger said.

   Winter began Thursday but almost no one stopped to notice. It
was still too cold.
   The arctic onslaught of record low temperatures that has plagued
much of the nation for 10 days sent another thrust across the
border, closing hundreds of schools from Montana to the Eastern
Seaboard, freezing an Amtrak train in its tracks in North Dakota
and threatening Texas' citrus crop.
   But the double wallop of frigid temperatures and high polar
winds blamed for more than 40 deaths nationwide was expected to
slacken after Friday, promising a Christmas that would be merely
seasonably cold, forecasters said.
   ``We're going to moderate right into Christmas,'' said National
Weather Service forecaster Steve Kahn in Chicago. ``Temperatures
have stopped falling _ they are going to rebound a little bit.''
   That was small comfort across the Midwest and West, where wind
chills Thursday dipped to as low as 83 below in North Dakota, more
than 70 below in Minnesota and Nebraska and 61 below in Illinois.
   In Havre, Mont., an overnight low of 43 below broke a record for
the day set 1884. Chicago set a new record with a minus 13, colder
than in 1872, when the previous record of 12 below zero was set.
   In all, at least 17 cities reported new record low temperatures
for the date Thursday morning, including 20 below zero in Omaha,
Neb.; 19 below in Dubuque, Iowa; 17 below in Des Moines; and 7
below in Topeka, Kan.
   Numerous record lows were likely to be established east of the
Rockies by Friday night, and before the cold wave is over parts of
the country may experience their coldest night of record, according
to National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas City.
   Snow generated by the cold front blew across much of the High
Plains and parts of the central Rocky Mountain region, the Ohio
Valley and the central Appalachian region in the afternoon.
   Weather service officials warned that the subzero temperatures
combined with stinging wind could cause frostbite in a matter of
minutes.
   ``This is just about as bad as it can get in Iowa,'' said
National Weather Service forecaster Scott Truett in Des Moines.
``Especially this time of year.''
   Chicago police opened station doors to the homeless seeking
shelter while waiting for vans to take them to city-operated
warming centers. At least 10 people have died of exposure in the
Chicago area since the cold snap began, said a spokeswoman for the
Cook County Medical Examiner's office.
   Among the deaths elsewhere were two elderly Pittsburgh-area
women whose space heaters, their only source of heat, were not
enough to withstand the cold, officials said. ``Basically it means
they froze to death,'' Deputy Coroner James Gregris said.
   Winter officially began at 4:22 p.m. EST Thursday, but it
clearly had its own timetable. By mid-morning, hundreds of schools
had been closed in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri,
Wisconsin, Ohio and New York.
   Some school officials said they did not want young children
waiting for buses or walking to school.
   ``We thought it might be dangerous,'' said Jean Kennedy, a
spokeswoman for Mthe Parkway school district in the St. Louis, Mo.,
area.
   Business was good at towing companies and auto parts stores, as
customers sought out batteries, thermostats and engine heaters.
Tammy Collett of Council Bluffs, Iowa, said she called 10 towers
for assistance, but only one would send a truck.
   ``They said they were too busy or they wouldn't come out, and
they were all 24-hour towing companies,'' she said. ``It was not
very pleasant, that's for sure.''
   ``We haven't seen anything like this for five years,'' American
Automobile Association spokeswoman Maureen Quinn said in Madison,
Wis. ``The number of road calls for road service is seven times our
normal level.''
   Other businesses that employ outdoor workers gave employees the
day off Thursday. In Indiana, the Salvation Army issued ``take
cover'' warnings to its bell ringers.
   ``The roofers are off,'' said Louise Wolotka, a secretary with
Charles Gluth &amp; Sons roofing company in Gary, Ind. ``Even the
ground crews are off. We wouldn't do that to them. It's too
dangerous with the wind chill up on the roof.''
   ``Everybody's getting calls. I hope it stays like this for
another month,'' said Jason Grosz, a district sales manager in the
Bismarck, N.D., office of the American Automobile Association.
   In Minot, N.D., Amtrak's Empire Builder passenger train came to
a halt as fuel froze in its engine, stranding about 300 passengers
in area motels overnight Thursday.
   Forecasters in Texas and Louisiana feared a worse cold snap than
the December 1983 freeze that virtually wiped out the Rio Grande
Valley's citrus crop, killing hundreds of thousands of orange and
grapefruit trees. Temperatures were expected to drop into the lower
20s Friday and Saturday.
   That disaster crippled the Valley's economy and forced growers
to replant trees that were expected to mature this season and
produce a full crop for the first time.
   In Louisiana, citrus farmers got all hands into the groves,
picking frantically to save as many oranges and satsumas as
possible.
   ``If it gets down to 25 and stays there for five hours, which is
very possible, we would lose the fruit,'' said Gwen Becnel.
   Elsewhere, strong northerly winds produced squalls with heavy
snow in the Great Lakes region. Subzero temperatures and blowing
and drifting snow blanketed parts of upstate New York Thursday
morning. The town of Pulaski was buried under 4 feet of snow in one
night, and 2 feet of snow was reported at Barnes Corners.
   In western Pennsylvania, the arctic cold front was expected to
send the wind chill index plunging to 40 degrees below zero Friday
night.
   Sunny skies and seasonable temperatures prevailed across much of
the West, however, with the Rocky Mountain range serving as kind of
a protective barrier from the arctic invasion.

   The Organization of American States suspended
its Thursday session five minutes after it opened, as
representatives divided on the wording of a resolution to condemn
the U.S. military intervention in Panama.
   OAS Chairman Angus Albert Khan of Trinidad and Tobago said he
had been approached by several delegations asking for more time
before beginning debate on a resolution submitted Wednesday by
Nicaragua. He did not say when the session would resume.
   Nicaragua's leftist government on Wednesday introduced a
resolution calling on the members to condemn the use of force and
demand the immediate withdrawal of American troops. As written, the
measure could be interpreted to include the more than 10,000 U.S.
soldiers permanently based in Panama.
   The members held firm to OAS procedures Wednesday and put off
debate on that resolution for 24 hours. They also used established
procedures to rebuff a request by the U.S.-recognized government of
Guillermo Endara in Panama to accept a new representative.
   Instead, Panama is representated by Jose Maria Cabrera, who
decried ``the brutal and criminal aggression'' against his homeland
and de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Traditional U.S. allies, in speech after speech Wednesday, spoke
out against the use of force in the region. But the agreement
stopped there.
   OAS sources, speaking Thursday on the condition of anonymity,
said at least two other resolutions were being prepared by the
Latin countries. The sources said the new drafts would include a
condemnation of Noriega, who is wanted in the United States on drug
trafficking charges but eluded capture when troops stormed into
Panama City.
   The Caribbean members said they did not have enough time to
consult their governments on an appropriate response.
   ``It's even more fragmented that that,'' U.S. ambassador Luigi
Einaudi said after the session. He declined to comment further,
saying only that the United States ``obviously won't accept
condemnation.''
   The OAS has not been asked to decide which government it
recognizes in Panama. The United States announced Wednesday that
Endara was sworn into office hours after the first troops arrived.
He was elected in May in balloting later nullified by Noriega.
   During the Wednesday evening session, member nations long
considered U.S. allies read statements condemning the assault on
Panama. The criticism came from Chile, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala,
Haiti and Costa Rica.
   ``We see abusive practices have not been forgotten and we do not
accept it. We protest it,'' said Peruvian ambassador Edmundo Haya
de la Torre. ``This does not mean we support General Manuel Antonio
Noriega.''
   Defense for the U.S. assault came from El Salvador, which said
the U.S. action supported the freely elected government. Backing
also came from Canada, which holds observer status until it becomes
a member next year.
   Canadian representative Richard Gorham said his government
``regretted the use of force'' but added: ``We must nonetheless
again highlight the extraordinary circumstances which have caused
the United States to act as it has, and to support its objective of
restoring constitutional, democratic government to the republic of
Panama.''
   Cabrera accused the United States of ``slaughtering defenseless
civilians'' and said Panamanians would not back Endara.
   ``He will stay thanks to the bayonets, the gunships and the
tanks of the U.S. Army,'' he said. ``No worthy Panamanian, no
Panamanian who is aware of his homeland can accept Guillermo Endara
as president.''

   A federal judge Thursday delayed the start of
John Poindexter's Iran-Contra trial and demanded to see excerpts
from former President Reagan's diaries and notes, which Poindexter
wants to use in court.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene said, ``President Reagan
shall produce for the court's ... inspection'' by Jan. 7 some of
the materials sought by Poindexter. Greene will then determine
whether the material is relevant to the criminal charges against
Reagan's former national security adviser.
   Greene moved back the Jan. 22 starting date of Poindexter's
trial until Feb. 20, saying a delay is necessary because of pending
issues. Those include Poindexter's subpoenas, approved by the
court, seeking Reagan's documents.
   Greene quashed major portions of Poindexter's subpoenas for
documents from the former president, but kept in place the most
sensitive sections, those dealing with Reagan's diaries, notes and
notebooks.
   ``The court is not disposed to requiring President Reagan to
make wholesale production of documents which ultimately may turn
out to contain little or no material evidence,'' said the judge.
   ``The obvious answer to this dilemma ... is an ... examination
by the court of the relevant excerpts from the former president's
diaries, notes and notebooks to determine whether they contain
specific evidence that should be produced,'' said Greene.
   Greene said ``legal and historical precedents indicate'' that a
review by the judge is appropriate ``of the presidential papers at
issue.''
   The judge said that he will review the Reagn documents and
``render a decision on the ... parts of the Reagan diary, notes and
notebooks that must be made available'' to Poindexter.
   Greene said photocopies and typewritten transcripts may be
produced rather than the original documents.
   Poindexter obtained court approval to issue the subpoena for
Reagan's documents by submitting a secret paper outlining what he
believes they contain.
   The judge said that Reagan and President Bush will be permitted
to see that paper next month, if Reagan invokes executive privilege
in response to any decision by Greene to turn Reagan documents over
Poindexter.
   Executive privilege is the legal concept by which presidents can
shield from public disclosure documents used in carrying out their
constitutional duties. In the Watergate cases involving President
Nixon, courts ruled that the privilege could not be used to protect
evidence needed in a criminal trial of Nixon's former aides.
   Poindexter separately sought approval to subpoena Reagan earlier
this week, seeking testimony from the former president in person.
   Greene set up a schedule for Reagan's lawyers and President Bush
to file objections to that testimonial subpoena and for
Poindexter's lawyers to respond to the objections. Greene said he
will rule on the matter sometime after Jan. 8.
   The judge in October outlined Poindexter's statement of what he
expected to discover, filed in support of a request to issue a
subpoena to Reagan for documents.
   Reagan met Poindexter daily, frequently alone, and they
discussed specific matters which now are connected to the criminal
charges against Poindexter, the former national security adviser
says.
   The subjects discussed with Reagan include the accuracy of a
chronology prepared by former White House aide Oliver North and
reviewed by Poindexter, according to Greene's outline.
   The chronology falsely says no one in the U.S. government knew
until 1986 that a CIA-assisted November 1985 shipment to Iran
contained Hawk missiles.
   Four of the five criminal charges against Poindexter relate to
allegedly lying about the 1985 shipment.
   Reagan also discussed the administration's view of a House
resolution inquiring into whether North was raising money and
supplying military advice to the Contras.
   Poindexter is accused of obstructing Congress by sending letters
endorsing earlier White House denials that North was assisting the
Contras.
   Poindexter had subpoenaed documents from reagan touching on 67
meetings or events involving the former president and his national
security adviser. Fifty of the meetings or events involved the
Contras and 17 involved the administration's secret arms sales to
Iran, according to papers filed in the case.
   Poindexter also served a subpoena on the archivist of the United
States, who holds presidential documents. Greene quashed that
subpoena after the archivist asserted that he already had turned
over to the prosecutors the documents Poindexter was seeking.
   In another matter, Iran-Contra prosecutors said the restrictions
the judge placed on North's testimony may make it impossible to
call him as a witness against his former boss.
   Greene ruled this week that he would limit North's testimony
because it might have been tainted by Poindexter's immunized
testimony on Capitol Hill in 1987. The judge's decision rules out
use of most of North's testimony from his trial in April, in which
North frequently mentioned Poindexter. The office of the
independent counsel urged Greene to ``permit North to testify to
all events he currently recalls ... even if his current
recollection has been refreshed by Poindexter's immunized
testimony.''
   ``These limitations may preclude Mr. North from testifying at
all concerning conversations and events in which he participated
and which he currently recalls that are of critical importance to
this case,'' said the court filing by the independent counsel.
   North said last week he doesn't want to testify against
Poindexter. Prosecutors said North's ``demonstrated unwillingness
to answer substantively any question posed to him by the government
... may well preclude ... from calling this witness at all.''

   The Communist youth movement dismissed
its leadership Thursday and chose a 26-year-old graduate as chief.
Those ousted included the granddaughter of disgraced former party
boss Todor Zhivkov.
   The official news agency BTA said the changes were made at a
12-hour meeting that lasted until 3 a.m. Thursday
   Rossen Karadimov, a 26-year-old law graduate now studying
philsophy at Sofia University, was elected the new leader of the
youth movement, which traditionally has been a stepping stone to
high rank in the Communist Party.
   BTA said Karadimov has been a party member since 1984.
   Former leader Evgeni Ouzounov and five other secretaries were
relieved of their posts, the agency said. It said Zhivkov's
granddaughter, Zheni Slavkova, was dismissed from the governing
bureau and his son, Vladimir, stripped of the title of honorary
member of the youth group's policy-making Central Committee.
   Zhivkov, 78, and his family have lost all their power since he
was ousted as party chief Nov. 10 after ruling Bulgaria for 35
years.
   In its brief report on the youth movement meeting, BTA said it
decided to hold a special congress Feb. 24.
   Zhivkov's successor as president and party chief, Petar
Mladenov, has outlined plans to remove the party's guarantee of
exclusive power from the constitution and hold free elections by
May.

   The Florida Supreme Court on Thursday
ordered an innocent verdict for a former Army ``Soldier of the
Year'' sentenced to die in the 1978 murder of a young Walt Disney
World worker.
   The court, in a unanimous ruling, said there was insufficient
evidence to convict Robert Craig Cox, 30, a former Army Ranger. The
ruling vacated Cox's death sentence, reversed his conviction and
ordered the trial court to acquit him of all charges.
   ``The state showed the possibility that he might have been one
of several people who could have done it. That's not enough in a
criminal case,'' said Larry B. Henderson, an assistant public
defender in Daytona Beach who handled Cox's appeal.
   Henderson and the state attorney general's office said it was
rare for the Supreme Court to order an innocent verdict. Usually,
the court sends such cases back for new trials or sentencing
hearings.
   ``We may ask them to rehear it,'' said Richard Doran, the
prosecutor in the case. ``For a court to reverse a case and direct
an aquittal is very rare. Within my memory, there's been maybe one
or two cases where that's happened since the death penalty was
reinstated'' in 1976.
   Cox was convicted in 1988 of the killing 10 years earlier of
Sharon Zellers, 19. She disappeared after leaving work Dec. 30, and
her badly beaten body was found several days later in an orange
grove near Orlando.
   Police questioned Cox, who was in central Florida visiting his
parents, but brought no charges. He became a suspect because he was
staying in a motel adjacent to the grove and part of his tongue had
been bitten off the night before, indicating a possible struggle.
   The case went unsolved for a decade. In the meantime, Cox was
named the Army's ``Soldier of the Year'' in 1979, Henderson said,
and took part in the invasion of Grenada in 1983.
   In 1986, Cox ran into trouble in California and pleaded guilty
to kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon. He was sentenced to
nine years in prison and dishonorably discharged from the Army.
   Florida authorities then charged Cox with Ms. Zeller's murder,
and he was convicted in 1988. Cox contended throughout that
prosecutors had only circumstantial evidence, and on Thursday the
Supreme Court agreed.
   The state's case hinged on hair, O-type blood and a boot print
found in the victim's car. Expert testimony about the hair and
blood type, while saying both could be linked to Cox, was not
conclusive, the court said.
   Cox's boots were never compared with the print found in Ms.
Zeller's car, the court said, the missing piece of tongue was never
found and no witnesses had seen the two together.
   ``Circumstances that create nothing more than a strong suspicion
that the defendant committed the crime are not sufficient to
support a conviction,'' the justices wrote.
   Henderson said Cox would likely be transferred from death row at
the Starke prison to Orange County, where a formal aquittal hearing
would be held. Cox then would go to California to finish serving
his prison term there, he said.

   Two tour buses crashed head-on before
dawn Friday on a rainy stretch of the Pacific Highway between
Sydney and Brisbane, leaving at least 32 people dead in Australia's
worst road crash ever, police said.
   New South Wales state police superidentent Merv Lane said some
passengers still were trapped inside one of the coaches more than
five hours after the 3:30 a.m. accident in Fredrickton, about 280
north of Sydney. Forty people were hospitalized.
   The crash occurred two months after a bus and a tractor-trailer
collided at nearby Grafton, killing 20 people. The Pacific Highway
is considered one of Australia's most dangerous roads.
   Witnesses said the two buses involved in Friday's accident were
embedded in one another. Television footage showed bodies lining
both sides of the road.
   ``It's dreadful, there are people hanging from the bus
windows,'' said Marion Thomas, who lives near the scene and was
awakened by the sound of the crash. ``It was a terrible explosion.
It's a terrible sight.''
   It was not immediately known if any foreigners were aboard the
buses, though police, which downgraded the original death toll from
40, said it was believed all aboard were Australian.
   Police are investigating the cause of the accident.

   The Bush administration is preparing to reduce
U.S. ties with Romania following that country's ``brutal and
violent'' crackdown on anti-government demonstrations, U.S.
officials said Thursday.
   The officials said the cutbacks could affect programs of
economic, scientific and commercial cooperation with Romania and
that an announcement could come as early as Friday.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher hinted at the
possibility of sanctions, saying the administration was ``carefully
reviewing'' possible steps against Romania.
   ``A massacre of undetermined proportions is believed to have
taken place'' in Romania over the past several days, Boucher said.
   He said the U.S. Embassy in Bucharest reported that 13 young
people were killed Thursday by automatic weapons fire from
government security forces during a major demonstration. Other
fatalities may have occurred as well, he said.
   ``Anti-regime demonstrations in Timisoara and the government's
brutal and violent crackdown against them continue,'' said Boucher,
who noted that some reports put the death toll since the upheaval
began at several thousand.
   It was not clear whether the United States, as part of a
sanctions program, is planning to reverse a 1988 decision to send
to Romania weapons grade uranium.
   The 16.4 kilograms of uranium are slated to be used at the Triga
reactor near Bucharest, a facility for teaching, basic research and
the production of radioactive isotopes. Such isotopes are commonly
used in medical tests.
   But opponents said the amount of uranium is large enough to make
a bomb.
   U.S. trade with Romania has declined sharply since 1988 when
that country was deprived of the right to sell its exports at the
lowest possible tariff rates under the so-called Most Favored
Nation system.
   Boucher said President Nicolae Ceaucescu has blamed the unrest
on ``fascists and imperialist circles abroad.
   ``In fact, however, the growing anti-government movement
encompasses all of Romania's nationalities, who are showing their
unalterable opposition to Ceausescu and his policies,'' he said.
   Boucher said the U.S. ambassador in Romania, Alan Green, has
been rebuffed in repeated efforts to deliver a strong protest
against the crackdown in Timisoara.
   Deputy Secretary Lawrence Eagleburger attempted to see the
Romanian ambassador in Washington on Wednesday but was told the
ambassador was unavailable.
   ``We have summoned the Romanian ambassador to come to the
Department tomorrow to receive our protest,'' Boucher said.
   Telephone calls to the Romanian Embassy on Thursday were not
answered.
   Protests against the repression in Romania have been made in
statements issued by NATO, the European Community and by the
35-nation Helsinki group.
   Members of the Warsaw Pact, of which Romania is a participant,
have criticized the Romanian actions individually, Boucher said,
adding that the Bush administration has asked the Soviet Union to
use whatever influence it has on Romania. He did not characterize
the Soviet response.

<HEAD>Ex-Deputy Chief Arrested on Wire Fraud Charge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN DESMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former police deputy chief accused of cheating
investors and stealing money from the Detroit Police Department was
arrested Thursday on a federal charge of wire fraud, officials said.
   Kenneth Weiner was held without bond after a heariang before
U.S. Magistrate Virginia M. Morgan, after prosecutors argued
successfully that there was a risk the former civilian deputy chief
would flee.
   Weiner was carryng had dozens of blank checks, credit cards and
valid flight coupons when he was arrested early Thursday at Detroit
Metropolitan Airport in Romulus, said Assistant U.S. Attorney
Sheldon Light.
   The wire fraud charge is related to a pyramid investment scam in
1985 and 1986, U.S. Attorney Stephen Markman said.
   Earlier this month, Weiner was accused of stealing from a $1.4
million police secret service fund used for undercover operations.
He had access to the fund from 1980 to 1986, when he left the
department.
   The FBI, under a warrant issued by Morgan on Wednesday, arrested
Weiner without incident as he stepped off a plane from Los Angeles,
FBI Special Agent in Charge Hal Helterhoff said.
   Weiner's troubles began in 1986 when Caine Steel Co. of Detroit
filed a civil lawsuit against him, charging that he defrauded the
company of $379,000.
   He is suspected of duping as many as 90 investors out of about
$20 million in a scheme that involved gold and silver trading.
   Weiner, 43, resigned as a deputy police chief in 1986 in the
wake of allegations about the investment scheme. In his six years
with the department, he advised police on security and
anti-terrorism practices.
   Caine Steel's suit claimed Weiner said he represented COMSEC
Corp. and could turn ``a sizable profit above current market
interest'' on its investment. The alleged investment scheme used
new investors' cash to provide large returns to previous investors.
Such plans collapse when new investors can't be found.
   Earlier this month, Police Chief William Hart said Weiner stole
money from the police secret service fund. Phony corporations set
up by Weiner in California received checks from the fund.
   Weiner's companies paid $72,000 in rent for a Beverly Hills,
Calif., house occupied by Hart's daughter and son-in-law. Hart
signed checks to the corporations, but denies knowing anything
about the rent paid on his daughter's home.
   Weiner disappeared in recent weeks as federal and city officials
investigated the $1.4-million secret police fund. As of Thursday,
no charges had been filed against him on alleged theft from the
police department.
   Mayor Coleman Young this week reluctantly turned records of the
fund over to city auditors, who found that key documents needed to
trace money were missing. Police officials said a theft report was
filed.
   Young initially balked at turning over the records because he
said it could jeopardize undercover operations.

<TEXT>
   Comedian Roseanne Barr, who canceled her
wedding plans last week and said her fiance had entered an alcohol
and drug treatment clinic, Thursday pulled out of five theater
performances, citing exhaustion.
   Barr, the stand-up comic and television sitcom star who recently
made her first motion picture, ``has been forced to suspend all
current activities,'' said Susan Pfeifer, spokeswoman for the
Circle Star Center in San Carlos, south of San Francisco. ``Her
doctor has insisted that in order to preserve her health, she
reschedule all current engagements.''
   Barr's spokeswoman, Lisa Kasteler in Los Angeles, confirmed that
Barr was exhausted. ``She is at home and has not been
hospitalized,'' Kasteler said.
   Last week, Barr, 36, called off her January 20 wedding to Tom
Arnold, a former consultant to her show, ``Roseanne.''
   Barr protested Arnold's firing from the show and has stated that
she intends to leave television soon.
   Her first motion picture, ``She-Devil,'' with Meryl Streep, has
been a box-office disappointment so far.
   The shows at the Circle Star, a 3,700-seat theater-in-the-round,
were the only performances Barr had scheduled that were canceled,
Kasteler said.
   The theater had sold out the first of the shows on Dec. 28 at
$29.50 a ticket, and was close to selling out the others for prices
up to $40 a ticket for New Year's Eve, Pfeifer said.
   ``Because of the late date, we don't know if we'll be able to
schedule someone else those days,'' Pfeifer said.
   Barr rescheduled four of her performances for Feb. 22, 23 and
24, when she'll have two shows, but was unable to reschedule the
Dec. 31 performance, Pfeifer said.

   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _ Thousands of U.S. troops moved into the capital on the second
day of their offensive. They encountered sporadic firing but U.S.
officials said their forces were in control.
   _ President Bush said the military operation was ``open ended,''
indicating it would last as long as necessary to capture Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega and restore order in Panama.
   _ New President Guillermo Endara addressed the legislative
assembly, under heavy U.S. guard. He said he would welcome back
members of Noriega's forces who support democracy.
   _ U.S. troops surrounded the Nicaraguan and Cuban embassies with
armored personnel carriers, following rumors that Noriega may have
fled there. In response, Nicaraguan troops in armored cars and
tanks surrounded the U.S. Embassy in Managua.
   _ A $1 million bounty offer led to a flood of tips and rumors on
Noriega's whereabouts. Callers placed him in numerous locations in
Panama and in Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Mexico. Israeli
television reported he had been seen on the luxurious island of
Contadora off Panama's coast and that he was planning to escape to
Nicaragua.
   _ Hundreds of stores in Panama City were looted, and their goods
were sold on the streets of the city's slums.
   _ The U.S. military reported 21 soldiers and the wife of one
U.S. serviceman were killed, 208 wounded and four missing. U.S.
officials said 59 Panamanian soldiers had been killed and 66
wounded. A doctor at a Panama City hospital said 80 dead and about
1,000 injured were brought there; he could give no breakdown of
civilian and military.

   The designated U.N. envoy of the
U.S.-installed government in Panama said Thursday that if Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega is captured, he should not be extradited to
the United States but tried in Panama.
   Later Thursday, the 15-member Security Council debated the
Panama invasion, with many governments denouncing the United
States. But the council could not decide which government to
recognize _ Noriega's or the U.S.-backed government of Guillermo
Endara _ and no further meeting was scheduled.
   Both sides have sought to have their ambassadors accredited to
the United Nations, which can recognize only one of them.
   Eduardo Vallarino, a self-exiled Panamanian businessman, was
nominated as Panama's U.N. ambassador by Endara's government,
installed by U.S. troops at a military base Wednesday.
   Vallarino told a news conference that Panama's Constitution
prohibits extradition. If Noriega is captured by occupying U.S.
forces, he said, Panama would protest his extradition to face
narcotics charges in the United States.
   ``I would have to say that probably the Panamanian government
would have to protest,'' Vallarino said in answer to a question.
   ``If Noriega is apprehended by the authorities in Panama, he
will have to be duly charged and tried in Panama,'' Vallarino said.
   But he added that the situation is ``irregular.''
   He also said the Endara group had not sought U.S. intervention
in Panama, but welcomed it.
   Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, in his first comment
on the U.S. intervention, said: ``The position of the U.N. for the
last 45 years is that we always regret the use of force.''
   He added that he hoped the Security Council would reach
agreement ``to restore order in Panama.''
   He spoke before the council reconvened at the request of
Nicaragua, which along with the Soviet Union condemned the U.S.
invasion Wednesday night.
   Nicaragua seeks council condemnation of the U.S. military
action, but the United States and Britain could veto any critical
resolution.
   Discussion of credentials by the Security Council is rare and
has not occurred in recent memory.
   The Noriega government is not represented in the United Nations
because the previous envoy, Leonardo Kam, has been promoted to
foreign minister. That government is trying to accredit as U.N.
envoy its ambassador to the European Community, Mirla Bellavita.
   U.N. diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
expected the council would not take up the question of competing
claims. They said the council was likely to ask the
secretary-general for a report. The secretary-general, however, had
said he hoped the council would decide the question.
   The question ultimately could be passed on to the General
Assembly, diplomats said. But according to the U.N. Charter, the
159-nation assembly cannot take up a question while it is under
consideration by the council, without a request by the council.
   The U.N. legal department is studying the question.
   The Organization of American States in Washington declined to
recognize the Endara government Wednesday.
   Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia in late 1978 posed a similar
problem for the General Assembly, which refused to recognize the
Vietnam-installed government and still recocognizes the ousted
Cambodian government in exile, headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk
and his allies.
   Speakers from 10 countries addressed the council Thursday, and
all except El Salvador denounced the U.S. invasion, although some
also criticized Noriega.
   El Salvador did not specifically endorse the U.S. action, but
criticized Noriega's undermining of democracy and
self-determination in Panama.
   Peru was especially vocal in condemning ``flagrant violation of
Panama's sovereignty'' in what it called ``a grim updating of
imperialist practices.''
   Other speakers included Algeria, Brazil, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland
and Libya. In the first debate Wednesday night, only Britain
staunchly backed the U.S. action.

   Two earthquakes, including one measuring 6.0 on the
Richter scale, struck in the sea off northern Japan early Friday,
but no damage was reported.
   Police said there were no immediate reports of damage from the
quakes, which occurred within an eight-hour period.
   The first, at 1:50 a.m., was centered 12 miles under the seabed
in the central part of the Kuril Islands, the agency said.
   The Kurils are a group of 56 islands, all of volcanic origin,
extending 750 miles between Hokkaido, Japan's northernmost main
island, and the Soviet Kamchatka Peninsula.
   The second tremor, 24 miles below the ocean floor off northern
Ibaraki Prefecture, registered 4.6, officials said.
   The October killer quake that rattled the San Francisco Bay area
measured 7.1.

   A three-judge panel on Thursday certified
the election to governor of Democrat L. Douglas Wilder in a recount
that gave him a 6,741-vote margin over Republican J. Marshall
Coleman.
   The recount confirmed Wilder as the first black elected governor
in history, with 896,936 votes to 890,195 for Coleman, who picked
up 113 votes in the recount.
   The first count of the Nov. 7 election gave Wilder victory by
6,854 votes, or four-tenths of 1 percent of the 1.78 million votes
cast. Under state law, that margin was close enough for Coleman to
get a recount at state expense.
   The first statewide recount in Virginia was conducted Wednesday
in the state's 136 localities. The results were driven to the State
Board of Elections.
   William H. Hurd, Coleman's attorney, said the Republican would
not challenge the judges' decision in the General Assembly.
   ``The outcome of this hard-fought contest is no longer in
doubt,'' Coleman said in a prepared statement handed to reporters.
   ``As an individual and as the nominee of my party, I cannot deny
that it hurts to come so close and yet fall short,'' Coleman said.
``But the system has worked, the people have spoken, and Doug
Wilder deserves and will have my full support as our new governor.''
   Wilder also issued a statement declaring that he ``never had any
doubt about the outcome.''
   Board of Elections employees tabulated the results from each
voting machine to get totals for each of the state's 1,967
precincts and then added those figures to get a total for each
locality. The numbers were checked by independent auditors before
being passed for inspection to the lawyers for Wilder and Coleman.
   ``The results are an outstanding tribute to the accuracy and
integrity of the electoral process,'' said Lawrence Framme,
chairman of the state Democratic Party. He said it was ``truly
amazing'' that only 113 errors were made of almost 1.8 million
votes cast, only 113 errors were made.
   The Republicans, however, said the process needs to be changed
to prevent felons from registering to vote. Hurd said the Coleman
camp found 3,000 to 4,000 felons on the voter rolls, and he
estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 voted.
   Earlier, Hurd had called the recount a ``very worthwhile
proceeding as I think the results will bear out.''
   Circuit Judges Melvin R. Hughes Jr. of Richmond, Robert W.
Stewart of Norfolk and Herbert A. Pickford III of Charlottesville
were present to settle any disputes and to certify the results.

<TEXT>
   The ``Comandancia'' complex that was
the nerve center for Manuel Antonio Noriega's regime is a dank and
gutted ruin today, bristling with U.S. soldiers trying to root out
the last snipers of the dictator's forces still roaming the city.
   A group of reporters, escorted into the area for a look at the
sites of the heaviest fighting in the U.S. invasion, were hustled
back into the van with a warning from soldiers: There was
occasional sniper fire from a high-rise apartment building that
makes a backdrop to the comandancia.
   The entrance to the area, a poor section of Panama City called
Chorrillo, was littered with the wreckage of three cars. Across the
intersection, someone had painted on the bottom of a billboard:
``Yanqui go home.''
   Soldiers backed a tanklike personnel carrier into the burned-out
remains of a laundry, commanding a view of a nearby intersection.
Up the street a hydrant gushed water into the gutter, adding to the
stench of the burned and soaked rubble. Streets were filled with
twisted corrigated metal roofing, burned stocks of weapons, pieces
of blocks and tile. High-rise buildings were deserted and large
portions of the area had been reduced to blackened rubble and
twisted pipes.
   Outside the commandancia, an iron fence was strung with colored
lights for Christmas. Walls were blackened or pocked with 50 cal.
bullet holes, or simply blown away. The roof was twisted and iron
bars hung limply from the windows. Said one soldiers: ``There was
an awesome amount of firepower put on this place.''
   A broken scene in front of the commandancia lay is disarray, the
plastic figures shattered. At the end of the block, a soldier
points out the ``G-2'' headquarters, where it is alleged much of
the harassment of detained Americans had occurred. The structure
had much less damage than the turquoise-and-white commandancia
building.
   At the edge of the rubble of the several blocks around the
commandancia was a grisly scene from the early fighting: A compact
car, mashed to one-third its height with a body sprawled across the
remains of the front seat. Soldiers explained that when the U.S.
assault moved into the area, a patrol found the auto with its
occupants handing out AK-47 assault rifles to Noriega fighters. One
U.S. armored personnel carrier just rolled over the car, a soldier
said. Thirty feet down the street was a similarly squashed hulk of
anorther small car.
   Among the graffiti and advertising placards of the downtown area
could frequently be seen the painted slogqn ``Yanqui go home.''
Noriega's visage smiled out from the sides of some of the
buildings, in paintings that carried the slogan ``General of Peace
_ a commander for a long while'' or, ``For Panama, my life. Not a
single step backward.''

   A pilot attempting to make an emergency
landing on an interstate highway landed instead on the back of a
moving semi-trailer truck, the state patrol said Thursday.
   There were no injuries in the incident, which happened around 9
p.m. Wednesday on Interstate 94 about four miles west of Rothsay in
west-central Minnesota, said highway patrol spokeswoman Roxanne
Ingum.
   Ingum said the single-engine Cessna piloted by Robert Russell of
Cottage Grove was en route from the Twin Cites to Grand Forks,
N.D., when the plane's engine apparently iced up.
   Ingum said Russell attempted an emergency landing on Interstate
94, but the plane touched down on a grain truck westbound on the
freeway, then slid off the truck into the center median.
   Russell and passenger Brad Schirmers of St. Louis Park, both
attending the University of North Dakota Flight Schol, were unhurt
and Ingum said the truck driver was described as shaken but also
escaped injury.
   Federal aviation officials are investigating the accident.

   President Bush vowed Thursday to press Mikhail
S. Gorbachev for freedom for Jews denied the right to emigrate from
the Soviet Union to join their families elsewhere.
   ``We'll get the job done,'' Bush promised an audience at a
ceremony in the Old Executive Office Building commemorating the
Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins Friday.
   Bush said that during the Dec. 2-3 summit with Gorbachev in
Malta, he presented the Soviet president with a list of 20
``refuseniks.''
   The first name on the list, he said, was Vladimir Raiz, whose
wife, Karmella, was present at the ceremony with Bush.
   ``Let me assure you, we'll do all in our power to free your
husband and those like him,'' Bush said.
   Gesturing toward the audience, which was sprinkled with newly
emigrated youngsters, Bush said, ``For sake of the children who are
with us today, from countries that still deny freedom of faith, we
will strive for the religious freedom their parents have never
known.''
   The Soviet Union has greatly loosened emigration restrictions in
recent years, and as a result Bush may grant that country trade
concessions denied in previous years.

   President Nicolae Ceausescu sent tanks
into the streets of Bucharest Thursday and security forces with
submachine guns fired on young demonstrators protesting his iron
rule, killing at least 13 people.
   In Washington, the State Department said a ``massacre of
undetermined proportions'' was believed to have taken place the
last few days. Officials said the Bush administration was preparing
to reduce ties with Romania and hinted at possible sanctions.
   Petar Tomic, a Yugoslav journalist in the closed country, said
an armored vehicle crushed two students, other students rushed to
their aid and security forces opened fire, killing or wounding
about 20 people. He said other people were shot down, but he did
not have a casualty count.
   Clashes were reported in at least two other cities Thursday. A
Polish couple interviewed by Hungarian television said that in the
eastern city of Arad, soldiers fired on about 3,000 demonstrators.
   They said they saw some students ordered out of a college, made
to stand up against a wall and shot dead. When the alleged shooting
occurred was not clear.
   American diplomats counted at least 13 people felled by
automatic weapons fire and said more were possible, according to
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher.
   Jonathan Lamb, first secretary at the British Embassy in
Bucharest, told British Broadcasting Corp. TV that two of his
colleagues had seen the bloodied bodies of eight or nine young
people with head wounds, and guessed there could be many more.
   ``One of my colleagues stepped over a dead body,'' he said.
``Two of my colleagues have been towards another demonstration near
the American Embassy and they have found bodies in the streets.''
   He said he had ``no doubt'' security forces had fired on
protesters.
   It was the first violence in the capital since hundreds,
possibly thousands, of anti-Ceausescu demonstrators reportedly were
shot and killed by security forces last weekend in the
Transylvanian city of Timisoara, 500 miles from Bucharest.
   By 3 p.m., the official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug and the
Bulgarian state news agency BTA said from Bucharest, firing had
stopped. Elderly people urged troops not to act against the
protesters, BTA said.
   By early evening, however, Yugoslav radio and Tass reported more
bursts of automatic weapons fire.
   ``The streets are becoming more and more animated,'' Tass said,
adding that Romanian state TV had not begun its customary broadcast
at 8:00 p.m.
   The demonstators ``are surrounded by Romanian army soldiers,
special troops armed with truncheons and plastic shields and
security forces,'' Tass said. ``Choppers are patrolling over the
city.''
   The Tass correspondent said he was told by a man in plain
clothes, who identified himself as ``a representative of the
working people who helps to preserve order,'' that there was no
loss of life.
   The man said people who were seen being carried to ambulances
``had no time to dine, got overexcited and fainted.''
   Mass protests began after Ceausescu was shouted down while
addressing an official rally in a downtown square in the capital,
an occurrence unheard of in the nation he has treated like a feudal
fiefdom for 24 years. Official media switched off live coverage
when the jeering started.
   Last weekend in Timisoara, 30 miles from the Hungarian and
Yugoslav borders, police and soldiers opened fire on crowds
shouting ``Bread!'' and ``Down with Ceausescu!'' Estimates of
deaths there range from hundreds to 4,000.
   Resistance to Ceausescu, who on Wednesday returned from a
three-day official visit to Iran, spread to other cities in
Transylvania, to Moldavia in the north and on Thursday to Bucharest.
   Clashes were also reported Thursday in Arad and Cluj in
Transylvania. General strikes were reported in Timisora and Arad.
   Ceausescu, 71, faces his most serious challenge, with no support
and much criticism from Warsaw Pact allies whose societies are
being transformed by a democratic tide. The downfall of the old
guard elsewhere in Eastern Europe has made Ceausescu the
longest-serving Communist ruler.
   Journalists have not been admitted to Romania since the weekend,
and the travel of those already in the country is severely
restricted.
   Hungarian radio said in an early evening broadcast that
protesters chanted, ``The army is with us!'' _ indicating some
soldiers were unwilling to fire at demonstrators _ but also quoted
Hungarian Defense Ministry spokesman Gyoergy Keleti as saying
Romanian security forces wore military uniforms.
   Yugoslav media, quoting witnesses, reported that soldiers and
police who refused to fire on anti-government protesters in
Timisoara were executed. They did not say when the executions
occurred.
   Yugoslav radio said there were unconfirmed reports of strikes in
factories and that students were promoting a general strike.
   Hungarian radio said the Communist Party's ruling Politburo was
meeting in unannounced session, probably discussing the unrest.
   Timisoara was reported near open revolt.
   ``According to accounts coming from journalistic circles,
enterprises, plants and factories aren't working in Timisoara,''
Tass reported. ``They have been occupied by workers, who have
warned that if their conditions aren't met, they will blow up these
enterprises.
   ``The conditions ... include a demand for the government's
resignation and a demand that party officials, military and other
leaders who allowed loss of life in the town be called to account.''
   It said the workers demanded withdrawal of the army and,
``according to the latest information, the military units have
started to leave.''
   A Romanian who crossed to Yugoslavia said tanks were withdrawn
from Timisoara after workers occupying a large petrochemical plant
and threatened to blow it up.
   A Romanian traveler arriving in Yugoslavia said he also had
heard of protests Thursday in Craiova in the south and Suceava in
the north.
   Reports of continuing trouble in Timisoara suggested Ceausescu
obtained little effect by declaring a state of emergency in the
region Wednesday night that set an 11 p.m. curfew and banned
gatherings of more than five people.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn of Hungary said he had heard of
clashes ``between security forces'' and some army units and that
there was ``a serious political movement'' against Ceausescu.
   French President Francois Mitterrand said Ceausescu's days in
power ``are numbered.''
   A French radio station said Romanian exiles in Rome had
announced the desire to form a government-in-exile.
   At the official rally at which Ceausescu spoke, hundreds of
people began to boo and jeer, and thousands more soon joined in,
Tomic journalist said.
   Live radio transmission was interrupted for about three minutes
as the protesters approached and booed and jeered Ceausescu, whose
austerity programs and other harsh policies have imposed rationing
and other hardships on his 23 million people.
   Suddenly, there was a high-pitched noise on the radio, then
patriotic music was played for about three minutes before
Ceausescu's speech resumed in midsentence. Later broadcasts of the
speech were edited to omit the jeers.
   About 25 minutes after the scene at the rally, a Western
diplomat said, street protesters could be heard chanting ``Down
With Ceausescu!'' ``Freedom!'' and ``Timisoara, Timisoara!''
   Late in the afternoon, Hungarian radio said ``tens of thousands
of people'' were in the streets of Bucharest, some cutting the
Communist emblem out of the national flag after burning banners
made for the official rally.

   Israeli troops shot and killed two Palestinians
on Thursday after soldiers were stoned as they tried to arrest
uprising activists in a West Bank village, the army said.
   Five other Palestinians, two of them women, suffered gunshot
wounds in the incident, Arab reports said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 21 Palestinians were shot and
wounded in scattered stone-throwing clashes with Israeli troops,
Arab reports said.
   The military confirmed seven wounded in Gaza and five in the
West Bank.
   Also Thursday, more than 150 Palestinian university
administrators and professors launched a campaign to demand Israel
to reopen colleges and universities closed by the army almost since
the start of the Palestinian uprising.
   At an organizational meeting, the group said that the closures
in the West Bank and Gaza since January 1988 were depriving 42,000
Palestinians of an education and seriously damaging the finances of
the institutions.
   ``We are being banned from a basic right, access to schools and
universities,'' Adib Khatib, a vice president at An-Najah
University in Nablus, told the meeting in Jerusalem. ``This
collective punishment must be brought to an end.''
   The deaths occurred in Beit Furik, a village of about 5,000
people near Nablus.
   The army said soldiers raiding the village were attacked with
stones and concrete blocks and that one officer was lightly wounded
in the face.
   ``The soldiers shot a number of plastic bullets at the stone and
block throwers,'' the army said. ``Later it was reported that two
were killed.''
   The victims, Ayesh Wajeeh Khatatbeh, 17, and Zahi Tawfik
Hannani, 21, both were hit in the head, Arab reports said.
   The deaths raised to 633 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis since the start of the Palestinian revolt in December 1987.
   Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 161 other
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaborating with Israel.
   In the West Bank town of Bethlehem, soldiers putting up strings
of colored lights for Christmas Eve choir services were stoned by
Palestinian youths wearing green head bands of the Islamic Jihad
fundamentalist movement, witnesses said.
   The soldiers were decorating because Palestinian municipal
officials have canceled Christmas festivities in solidarity with
the uprising. The troops chased the stone throwers, but no arrests
were reported.
   The army announced Thursday that it has adopted rules to punish
the parents of child stone throwers in the Gaza Strip by
confiscating property or sealing off rooms in houses.
   The spokesman said the steps were being taken because minors,
those under age 12, cannot be jailed under Israeli law.
   ``All this is because we can't put the boy in jail,'' said the
spokesman, who cannot be identified under military regulations.
   The new rules require parents to post bail if a child is caught
throwing stones repeatedly. The spokesman said that if a family
refused to pay, the army could confiscate property or seal a room
of the family's house.

   Larry Mahoney was convicted Thursday of
27 counts of second-degree manslaughter in the nation's deadliest
alcohol-related traffic crash, which claimed the lives of 27 people
riding home from a church outing.
   The jury also convicted Mahoney on 12 counts of first-degree
assault and all but one of the 42 wanton endangerment counts he was
charged with in the fiery crash on May 14, 1988.
   ``I accept your verdict,'' Mahoney later told jurors, and
collapsed in tears.
   Mahoney, a 36-year-old chemical plant worker, escaped a possible
life sentence when the jury opted for the less serious charge of
manslaughter, which carries a maximum prison sentence of five to 10
years. He had been charged with 27 murder counts, but the jurors
had the option of two lesser charges.
   The only acquittal was on a charge of wanton endangerment of
Clint Bradley, a motorist whose car nearly was struck by Mahoney's
pickup, which was traveling the wrong way down an interstate
highway.
   Defense attorneys had acknowledged that Mahoney was drinking on
the day of the accident; however, they argued that a defective bus
design was the primary cause of the deaths, and that he had been
tricked into drunkenness.
   The jury deliberated about 11 hours and returning shortly before
4 p.m., when the lengthy verdict was read in Carroll County Circuit
Court. Jurors decided to begin immediately the penalty phase of the
trial, in which they would make a sentencing recommendation to
Circuit Judge Charles Satterwhite.
   Mahoney took the witness stand during the sentencing hearing and
told the jurors that he intended, after prison, to warn
schoolchildren of the dangers of drinking and driving.
   ``I know God kept me alive for a reason,'' Mahoney said. ``I
accept your verdict. ... I want you to know I don't feel bad toward
you in any way.''
   If at least one school child heeds his warning, Mahoney said,
``at least that will be one life saved.''
   After the one-hour hearing, the jury decided to quit for the
night and resume its work Friday in recommending the sentence to
Satterwhite. Two jurors were sick, said William Summers, a defense
attorney.
   Besides the manslaughter penalty, Mahoney could be punished more
severely for first-degree assault, which carries a possible
sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. First-degree wanton
endangerment is punishable by one to five years in prison.
   The judge decides whether the prison sentences are served at the
same time or consecutively.
   Mahoney bowed his head slightly, his eyes fixed on the tabletop
before him as the judge slowly read the verdict on each of the 82
counts. Mahoney remained composed throughout, but members of his
family broke down in tears.
   Mahoney's sister, Judy O'Donovan, patted him and whispered to
him before he was led from the courtroom. Mrs. Donovan later said
she told him ``that everything's going to be all right and that I
love him.''
   On the other side of the courtroom, crash survivors and victims'
families also reacted emotionally, some covering their mouths or
touching and holding one another for support.
   Before he read the verdicts, Satterwhite warned spectators that
``there should be no outbursts.''
   He advised all those in the courtroom to envision the worst
verdict from each person's standpoint, prepare themselves ``and if
you don't think you can handle it, leave the courtroom now.'' No
one left.
   Under Kentucky law, the jury had immediately recommended a
penalty for drunken driving and it set Mahoney's punishment at 30
days in jail with a $500 fine.
   Mahoney was driving his pickup in the wrong direction on
Interstate 71 near Carrollton when it rammed head-on into a bus,
killing 24 children and three adults who belonged to the Radcliff
First Assembly of God church.
   Mahoney's lawyers said he admitted being drunk and driving north
in the southbound lanes of the divided highway, striking the
church-owned former school bus as it returned a youth group from a
Cincinnati amusement park. But the defense said faulty design of
the bus gas tank, not the collision, caused the explosion and fire
that killed the victims.
   The former school bus' fuel tank ruptured and the bus burst into
flames, killing 24 children and three adults. Forty people escaped,
but 12 were severely burned.
   Autopsies showed the fire, not the crash, killed the victims.
   The jury began deliberating Wednesday afternoon.
   ``It's in my mind that I might go to jail, but another part of
my mind says everything will come out all right,'' Mahoney said in
an interview published in Thursday's editions of The
Courier-Journal of Louisville.
   Relatives of many of the victims watched Wednesday as Mahoney's
lawyers and special prosecutor Paul Richwalsky gave closing
arguments in the trial that began with jury selection Nov. 8.
   Lead defense attorney William Summers said Mahoney had been
beaten by public opinion like a ``cur dog'' since the crash.
   ``This tragedy needs to be put behind people,'' Summers said.
``Everyone needs to begin rebuilding their lives. The world has to
start anew.''
   Richwalsky, an assistant attorney general, said it was difficult
to reconcile the spirit of the season with the task before the
jury. But he told jurors they should not be ``more charitable''
toward Mahoney and his family because Christmas was near.
   Summers and co-counsel Jack Hildebrand stressed the twin themes
of Mahoney's defense _ that his intoxication was unintentional and
that the bus was unsafe because of a vulnerable fuel tank and seats
that spewed toxic fumes as they burned.

   A U.S. soldier was sentenced to five
years in prison Friday on charges of killing a South Korean farmer
in a street altercation in the southern port of Kusan, according to
news reports.
   Air Force Tech. Sgt. Bruce A. Harayda, 29, of Bridgeport, Conn.,
was found guilty in a trial at the Suwon District Criminal Court
outside Seoul, said the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
   Harayda was picked up after the Feb. 11 death of Chong Pan-yong,
a farmer in Kusan, following a street altercation with Harayda.
Kunsan is a provincial port 132 miles south of Seoul.
   Prosecutors contended Harayda threw Chong to the ground, causing
cerebral hemorrhage. His death triggered violent anti-U.S. protests
by radical students in Kusan demanding punishment of the American
soldier and financial compensation to Chong's family.
   During Friday's trial, about 50 relatives and students shouted
slogans and demanded South Korean police hold Harayda in custody.
Harayda has been held by U.S. authorities, Yonhap said.
   It was not known if an appeal was planned.

   Panama's newly installed leaders met
with members of the last legislative assembly and other public
figures under heavy U.S. guard Thursday, trying to gain control of
the country and declaring a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
   Gunshots echoed in the streets outside as President Guillermo
Endara and Vice Presidents Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo
Ford presided over the meeting, which contained the incongruous
spectacle of U.S. soldiers in jeans, sweatshirts and other civilian
clothes sprinkled throughout it.
   In his speech to an audience of about 200, Endara held out an
olive branch to followers of deposed dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Endara, his vice presidents and members of the audience sang
with special feeling their national anthem and one line in it, ``We
have finally achieved our victory.''
   Endara ordered a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew in hopes of maintaining
law and order as thousands of looters roamed the streets smashing
in windows and hauling away goods from virtually every shop in the
city.
   U.S. troops were too busy with snipers and small bands of armed
Noriega loyalists to challenge the looters.
   The new government, by the accounts of most foreign observers,
overwhelmingly won an election on May 7, but Noriega cancelled it
and continued his rule.
   At the time, Endara and Ford were beaten by members of one of
Noriega's ``Dignity Battalions,'' units who are still wrecking
havoc in the aftermath of the U.S. military takeover that started
early Wednesday morning.
   Two close aides to Endara, jailed by Noriega over a month ago
and feared by opposition members to have been tortured or killed,
appeared suddenly at the podium at the start of the session and
were embraced by Endara and his two vice presidents to a warm
ovation.
   The two men, Miguel Batista and Ivan Mojica, were spirited away
by Noriega's police and had not been heard from since. They were
freed from a jail by U.S. troops on Wednesday.
   Several people attending the session said they were grateful for
the U.S. intervention.
   ``The United States is responsible for delivering the dream we
have had since 1968,'' said cattleman Felix Espansona, an assembly
member in 1952-1956.
   ``We have had a dictatorship for 20 years and now we feel
liberated.''
   Endara called the new leadership ``The National Reconstruction
Government.'' In a brief speech he made no threats of retaliation
against followers of Noriega, now the subject of a nationwide
manhunt by the U.S. military and with a $1 million reward offered
by the White House for his capture.
   In a bid for unity, Endara said he would welcome back members of
Noriega's defense forces ``who can show they support our
democracy.''
   Vice President Ford said it will take some time to restore
order, but U.S. troops should leave ``the sooner the better'' .
   He also said, ``It is highly important for our country that
General Noriega be caught and be brought to justice.''
   A top U.S. military official agreed that Noriega's capture is
critical in restoring law and order.
   ``It's a problem because as long as you have the head of the
snake and you have parts of the snake's body, and he can make the
tapes like he did yesterday'' then you'll `have some number of
hard-core loyalists,'' said Lt. Col. Bill Bennett, chief of
contingency operations plans in U.S. Southern Command.
   The Endara government, strongly backed by President Bush, met
amid tight security provided by dozens of U.S. troops who were all
dressed in civilian clothes.
   Panamanian politicians did not want to give the impression of
total dependence on U.S. supports, so the soldiers were asked not
to wear their uniforms, several of them told reporters.
   Looking out of place with their crewcuts and bluejeans, they sat
in the audience to prevent trouble in the National Assembly
building.
   While the speeches were being delivered inside the government
building, shots rang out across the street, scattering scores of
looters and curiosity seekers from outside the wrought-iron gates
around the Assembly.
   A U.S. officer in charge of security dismissed it as a minor
incident. ``Only some shopkeeper firing shots into the air to scare
away a looter,'' the officer told a reporter.
   Government officials said all public offices and buildings would
be closed for the next two days _ virtually everything in Panama
has been closed
   since the U.S. attack _ and it was unclear when they might
reopen.
   The major exception was the Panama Canal, which resumed full
operations at dawn Thursday, military officials said. Dozens of
cargo ships were offshore awaiting a chance to go through the canal.
   The opposition to the American military takeover in the capital
city was mostly disorganized, said Bennett, but some Noriega
military units remained in the countryside and would have to be
dealt with.
   With the operation more than 30 hours old, the U.S. completed
taking control of the national assembly building, demolished
Noriega's former headquarters and took control of other key points
in the city.
   Late Wednesday, soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division swept
through the downtown Marriott hotel where some Americans were
trapped.
   Bennett estimated that some 3,000 of the 24,000 U.S. troops
involved in the operations were military police, who would be
taking over police duties formerly carried out by Noriega's forces.
   ``Their mission will be to re-establish law and order in Panama
City,'' he said.
   One of the primary duties will be to identify and hand over
duties to Panamanian police officers who ``will be loyal to a
democratic government,'' he said.
   As the police units take over downtown, attack units would turn
their attention to routing out the remaining Noriega loyalists
elsewhere _ a job which would be made easier if Noriega is found
and captured.
   ``Without Noriega as a rallying point, a lot of the units out
there that have been sitting on the fence will be calling to tell
us that they will support the democratic government,'' he said.
   U.S. officers reported that there was a mortar fired overnight
near Fort Clayton, a major U.S. military installation, but had no
details of any damage.
   They also reported that a special unit seized a 65-foot
Panamanian boat near the Bridge of the Americas spanning the Panama
Canal. They captured 18 armed men aboard but found no explosives.

<TEXT>
   Aviation pioneer Dwane Wallace, who guided
Cessna Aircraft Co. to dominance in the light plane industry, died
Thursday. He was 78.
   ``He was a shy, modest American hero,'' said William Wentz,
director of the Institute for Aviation Research at Wichita State
University, Wallace's alma mater. ``He was happier talking to
engineers and pilots than he was a bunch of company presidents,
university trustees and such.''
   Wentz credited Wallace with being the first to sell
single-engine aircraft as a tool for businessmen. He said Wallace
also was a trailblazer in the transition to all-metal from
cloth-covered planes.
   Wallace had been hospitalized about six weeks at HCA Wesley
Medical Center. The family asked hospital officials not to release
information about his condition. He reportedly had suffered a
stroke.
   until recent months, he had remained active supervising his
business investments and piloting airplanes on trips.
   Wallace worked briefly as an engineer for Walter Beech, founder
of Beech Aircraft Corp., after graduating from WSU in 1933. He
assumed control at Cessna after his uncle, company founder Clyde
Cessna, was forced to close by the Depression.
   Wallace and his attorney brother, Dwight, reopened the company
in 1934 in Wichita. Clyde Cessna, who had started it in 1927, was
installed as president. Dwane Wallace was general manager.
   The first Dwane Wallace design Cessna manufactured, the C-34,
was a classic monoplane that became world reknowned as the Cessna
Airmaster.
   In the early years, Wallace did selling, test flying and was
known occasionally to enter air races when finances were tight to
meet the payroll with his winnings.
   Wallace relinquished his board chairmanship at Cessna in 1975,
staying on as a $75,000 a year consultant and a board member. He
later cut all ties with the company following a dispute with
current chairman Russ Meyer, his hand-picked successor. Wallace and
Meyer kept silent about the disagreement.
   ``Dwane left a legacy at Cessna which will continue to have a
positive effect for many years,'' Meyer said. ``He was an extremely
professional engineer who set high standards throughout the
company.''
   Wallace is survived by his wife, Velma; a sister, four daughters
and 11 grandchildren.

   The medical facilities set up in the
converted classrooms of Balboa High School have been treating
civilians as well as soldiers.
   They have tended everything from a 2-year-old girl with an
amputated foot to a 73-year-old woman looking for insulin.
   They have patched up a large number of gunshot and shrapnel
wounds and delivered one baby which was said to be healthy.
   However, Col. Michael McConnell _ who is the Southern Command's
command surgeon _ said Wednesday's military injuries were
``significant'' in terms of seriousness, but he said they had been
able to stabilize everyone.
   ``I'd be surprised if any of them died,'' he said.
   One of the Panamanian civilians, a tiny, gray haired woman
wearing sandals cried that her home had been destroyed by the
fighting. ``I don't have a thing,'' she said, ``just what I have
on.''
   Still the woman, who declined to give her name fearing
retaliation, did not condemn the American action, said ``God bless
America. The America fed my father. The America gave me everything.
God bless America.''
   Pfc. Doc Jurkiewicz, a 22-year-old who is from Dallas, Texas,
was being treated for shrapnel in the left leg. He said he was
injured as they were clearing buildings near the comandancia. The
area already was on fire and apparently a gas tank blew.
   Though he was hurt last night, he stayed on and did not come in
for treatment until Thursday morning. He said there were ``a lot of
people'' still fighting.
   Jurkiewicz was the only soldier who was being treated during a
tour by reporters Thursday morning.
   One or two of the military injuries had been very serious he
said, ``The flack jackets saved many.''
   Across the hall from where the soldier was being treated,
several Panamanians were receiving medical attention. Some appeared
to have serious injuries.
   Susana Rivero, an older woman, who got bumped into barbed wire
was being treated for a cut on her left foot. She said her home in
Chorrillo, a poor neighborhood near the PDF's headquarters was lost.
   ``Everything was bombed,'' she said.
   However, she said she was glad the Americans came and wants
deposed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega killed. She spoke of him as
still in office even though she had heard on the radio that
President Guillermo Endara had been sworn in.
   ``He has destroyed everything,'' she said of Noriega. ``He did a
lot of harm.'' She said he ought to be ``caught and killed.''
   Asked if she were glad the Americans came even though she lost
her home, she said, she was ``satisfied and calm'' and that the
Americans had never done any harm.

<TEXT>
   Susan Atkins, who fatally stabbed
pregnant actress Sharon Tate during the Charles Manson ``family''
killings 20 years ago, was denied parole for a ninth time Wednesday.
   In rejecting her bid for release, the state parole board noted
that Atkins was involved in three incidents resulting in the
premeditated murder of eight people ``for the bizarre motive of
starting a race war.''
   Atkins, 41, who is serving a life sentence on eight murder
convictions that included the 1969 Tate-LaBianca slayings, won't
get another parole hearing until December 1992, the three-member
board decided.
   Atkins, with other Manson followers, was convicted of murder and
conspiracy in 1971 for the murders of Miss Tate and four others at
the actress' home, and of for slayuing grocer Leno LaBianca and his
wife at their home the next night.
   Prosecutors argued during the Manson family trial that the
killings were part of Manson's plot to incite chaos, or ``Helter
Skelter,'' that would result in a black vs. white civil war.
   Manson, who expected ultimately to take control of the country
when the fighting ended, is serving a life prison sentence and has
repeatedly been denied parole.
   Miss Tate, who was 8{ months pregnant, was stabbed 16 times by
Atkins and Charles ``Tex'' Watson, who is serving a life sentence
in the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo.
   Presiding Commissioner Rudolph Castro called the crimes among
``the most heinous and callous ever committed in California, if not
in the nation.''
   The actress' mother, Doris Tate, addressed the board.
   ``Anyone has an alternative to do right. I don't understand why
anyone would murder an innocent pregnant woman,'' she said. ``The
thing that goes continually through my mind is the lack of
compassion Susan had for Sharon.
   ``When Sharon begged for her life, Susan said, `Shut up, bitch.
You're going to die.' And after they stabbed her 16 times they hung
her. I have nothing but contempt for this individual.''
   Prosecutor Stephen Kay, a Los Angeles County deputy district
attorney, told the board the release of Atkins would be ``one of
the most dangerous things this board can do.''
   Atkins said she realized she might spend the rest of her life
behind bars for acts she called ``unforgivable.''
   ``I take the blame,'' Atkins told the board. ``Not only am I
being punished, but I deserve to be punished for what I did.''
   Atkins' attorney, Deborah Fraser, said although her client's
crimes should not be excused, the board should put aside political
considerations and offer her a release date. She cited a 1989
psychiatrist's report that found Atkins ``less dangerous than the
average inmate.''

   After another huge demonstration,
Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu declared a state of emergency
in the city where witnesses say his security forces killed hundreds
of anti-government protesters last weekend.
   Tens of thousands of enraged people had filled the streets of
Timisoara Wednesday night, chanting ``Give us our dead!'' There
were reports that the unrest had spread to at least eight other
cities.
   Breaking his silence on the unrest, Ceausescu on Wednesday
blamed the weekend protests on ``hooligans'' incited by ``a brazen
campaign of slander and lies'' from abroad, especially Hungary.
   He has been accused by Budapest of persecuting ethnic
Hungarians, who are concentrated in the Transylvanian region that
includes Timisoara.

   The United States has plenty of plutonium for
future use in nuclear weapons, and the Bush administration should
drop plans to spend $1 billion to expand supplies of the material,
a government advisory panel concludes.
   The conclusion published Wednesday by a special committee of the
National Research Council contradicts the administration's repeated
assertions to Congress that additional capacity to make
weapon-grade plutonium is vital to national security.
   The Energy Department, which owns the nation's defense nuclear
materials plants, declined to comment on the report, which the
department requested in February 1988.
   Former Energy Secretary John Herrington said during the Reagan
administration that the nation is ``awash in plutonium,'' but his
successor, James D. Watkins, had disavowed the statement. Watkins
contends that while current plutonium supplies are adequate, more
capacity will be needed in the coming decade.

   The State Department, citing ``changing
conditions'' in the Soviet Union, is giving high priority to
constructing a new U.S. Embassy in Moscow to replace the one to be
razed after years of indecision.
   The job could cost up to $500 million. Nicholas Salgo, a former
U.S. ambassador to Hungary, was assigned Wednesday to hold formal
negotiations with the Kremlin. In the meantime, the Soviets will
continue to be shut out of their new embassy in the Mt. Alto
section of Washington and relegated to an older mansion near the
White House.
   Ever since U.S. intelligence 10 years ago detected what was said
to be a network of sophisticated listening devices in the Moscow
embassy, U.S. officials have pondered what to do with the $95
million building.
   Finally, on Wednesday, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
notified key members of Congress the embassy will be torn down and
a new one constructed in its place.

   The ice block on the Mississippi River has
created a traffic jam of 1,000 barges, giving some pilots time to
catch up on their reading.
   ``Right now, it's `Southern Outdoors,''' Roy East said by CB
radio Wednesday from his tugboat, tied up with 22 barges on an
island in the icy river just north of Alton. ``Mostly it's just sit
up here, and hurry up and wait.''
   A 200-mile stretch of the Mississippi, from Alton, just north of
St. Louis, down to Cairo in southern Illinois, was closed
indefinitely to barge traffic Monday night by the Coast Guard
because ice and low water had combined to make navigation unsafe.
   The shutdown comes at the slowest time of year for barge traffic
on the river, but it still worries shipping officials who fear
damage to barges stuck in and around the ice and mounting costs of
idled towboats.

   The federal judge who died after
opening a mail bomb was eulogized as a strong believer in the law
and a man ``who stood up for the underdog and the oppressed.''
   National and local judicial figures were among more than 700
mourners at Judge Robert S. Vance's funeral on Wednesday in a
church guarded by dozens of police officers and sniffed by dogs
trained to smell for bombs.
   The FBI said its probe of a wave of recent mail bombs in the
South remained open-ended, with authorities giving close attention
to whether the explosives were tied to a racist group such as the
Ku Klux Klan or the work of an individual.
   Vance, a member of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court and a former
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, was killed instantly
Saturday in his home when he opened a package and the bomb
exploded, sending 16-penny finishing nails into his lower abdomen.
The bomb also wounded his wife.

   When Technicolor was first tested in the
1930s, the on-screen results raised some well-penciled eyebrows:
The hills were green, the grass was green and the actors' faces ..
. were green.
   Max Factor, Hollywood's beauty guru, realized makeup was
reflecting the color of the scenery. So he headed to his shop,
experimented and delivered a makeup that dried to a dull finish. He
packaged the new product in round, flat containers. For lack of a
better name, Factor called it Pan-Cake makeup.
   It was one in a series of innovations offered by the Russian
immigrant during a Hollywood career that spanned 29 years.
   The name Max Factor was synonymous with movie glamour for
decades, but his true gift to Hollywood was to make actors appear
natural instead of glamorous.
   Factor's contributions to good looks can be seen at the Max
Factor Makeup Museum in Hollywood, founded in 1984 by curator Bob
Salvatore, a 23-year employee of Max Factor &amp; Co.
   ``Max saved Technicolor. And at the same time he invented modern
makeup,'' Salvatore said. ``Max knew he had something when the
actresses started stealing the Pan-Cake for their own use.''
   Salvatore admits the museum is part historical preservation and
part publicity for the company, now owned by Revlon Inc. Admission
is free and the ``museum shop'' is a Max Factor retail outlet.
   Unlike the tourist-oriented Hollywood Wax Museum or the
Fredericks of Hollywood Bra Museum with its exhibit of celebrity
undergarments, the Factor museum is notable for its quiet elegance.
   The main lobby has antique glass and wood cases displaying
powder, lipstick and perfume containers from past decades. Four
``color'' rooms, where beauty treatments were once given, branch
off from the lobby.
   When the rooms were added to the salon in 1935, each was
dedicated by an actress. The blonde room painted in shades of blue
was dedicated by Jean Harlow; the redhead room, in green hues, by
Ginger Rogers; the brunette room, in rose colors, by Claudette
Colbert; and the brownette room, in peach, by Rochelle Hudson.
   ``A woman could walk into the room for her color and immediately
be surrounded by a flattering environment,'' Salvatore said.
   For Factor, applying makeup was as much science as art. The
``beauty calibrator'' is a reminder of his search for the perfect
face, a quest, Salvatore said, that was never satisfied.
   The contraption, a mass of metal bands and pointers circling a
mannequin's head, was patented by Factor in 1932 to measure the
distance between the eyes, the length of the chin and other aspects
of a woman's face. With that information, Factor would apply makeup
to camouflage nature's imperfections.
   Another Factor invention on display is the kissing machine. He
wanted his lipsticks to withstand a perfect ``10-pound kiss.''
That, Salvatore said, is a ``respectable goodbye kiss between a
husband and wife. Any more than that and they are on their own.''
   Factor hired a man and woman to test the indelibility of new
lipsticks. But the pair, who were married to other people, soon
tired of the work and quit. Factor had rubber molds made of the
kissers lips and attached them to a hand-operated machine that
pressed the fake lips together.
   The Factor saga in America began in 1904, when he arrived in St.
Louis to run his display at the World's Fair. After the fair, he
stayed on, operating a barber shop for five years. Factor had
$40,000 in gold when he arrived in the United States but lost most
of it through bad business deals.
   After moving to Los Angeles in 1909, he opened a barber shop in
the theater district and made wigs and makeup for stage clientele.
Filmmakers soon sought him out with makeup problems.
   One early problem he tackled was converting stage greasepaint to
film makeup. The early film, monochromatic, did not register red,
so cheeks and lips looked black on the screen. Factor mixed up
colors that would look natural.
   ``Max Factor was not only the most important force in Hollywood
makeup, he was the only source that was interested in movie
makeup,'' said Howard Smit, a 30-year veteran of the Makeup and
Hairstylists union. ``This wasn't a product that you could make for
the masses.''
   The first film for which Factor had a contract to do all the
makeup and hair was ``Vogues of 1938.''
   Factor's sons, Max Jr. and Davis, carried on the legacy when he
died in 1938. The family sold the company in the 1970s. It was
owned by Beatrice Corp. and others until 1985 when Revlon purchased
it.
   During that time, the company expanded into a
multimillion-dollar international cosmetics firm. That prosperity
was fueled by the use of dozens of stars such as Loretta Young and
Bette Davis in celebrity ad campaigns unequaled before or since. A
few of the ads, appearing in international publications between
1928-47 are on display at the museum.
   It was not love of Factor's makeup that attracted the big names;
the actresses had little choice. They were told by the studios to
pose for Factor ads, Salvatore said. It was a relationship that
benefited both Factor and the studios.
   ``At the time he was shipping his makeup all over the world and
European sales for movies were even more lucrative than American,''
Salvatore said. ``The ads would say `Barbara Stanwyck in ``Double
Indemnity,''' and it would be like advance advertising for the
movie. And Max got to use a very recognizable face in his ads here.
No money ever changed hands, not a penny.''
   Hollywood recently knocked on Max Factor's door again. Director
Jack Nicholson wanted to use the museum to film a scene for the
movie ``The Two Jakes,'' a sequel to ``Chinatown,'' set in the late
1940s.
   In the scene, actress Meg Tilly, a brunette, comes to the salon
to have a facial.
   ``They filmed it in the blonde room,'' Salvatore said. ``Max
would have been appalled.''

   Zip. From Santas in tights to eight
maids-a-milking. Zip. From Ebenezer Scrooge's London to Christmas
in New York.
   And in they step, the high-kicking Rockettes and other
performers, from one costume to the next in a backstage
choreography with the precision timing of their on-stage routines
as Radio City Music Hall puts on its annual Christmas shwo.
   Dressers carrying plastic laundry baskets run with the clothes
dropped by one of the 79 cast members as he switches from the
London of Tiny Tim to the dancing rooftops of New York. Lined up
for each dancer in the production number are his tuxedo pants,
suspenders, fancy dressfront, bow tie and tailcoat in the order in
which they'll be donned. There also are black socks and patent tap
slippers, and a shoehorn beside each pair.
   ``The backstage choreography _ timing and rhythm _ is as
important as the choreography on stage,'' said Bree Daniels, who
has been a dresser for seven years, three at the Music Hall.
   Behind all this kinetic energy is the tiny, trim blonde whose
costumes are constructed, built, sewn, stamped and stretched with
this kind of activity in mind. And she's been doing it for 40 years.
   Leanne Mitchell, director of the Music Hall's mammoth costume
shop, constructs wings for Sugar Plum fairies, dresses Santa's
elves, sews buttons for wooden soldiers, stamps on sequins for
Rockettes, fashions swaddling clothes and drapes the brightly
colored silks of the Three Wise Men.
   Mitchell left her home in Iowa to come to New York and, in 1949,
at the age of 19, she was hired by the Music Hall as a seamstress.
The rest, as they say, is show biz.
   She still remembers her first glimpse, soon after she arrived in
New York, of the enchanted stage where today live camels bow to the
stable-born child, where the precision-dancing Rockettes bring
wooden soldiers to heel, where Christmas trees spring to life. She
even remembers the movie that played: ``A Date With Judy,''
starring Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Powell.
   She still seems slightly titillated by the glamour of it all and
admits she was awed by the girls of the chorus line when she first
joined the staff.
   ``I was their age when I came here,'' she says. Her mother told
her later that at the age of 8 she had written an essay saying that
someday she was going to come to New York and make clothes for the
Rockettes.
   ``They don't want something that doesn't fit them right. We have
to live with those costumes, we have to make them so they'll
last,'' she said drawing a comparison between one-shot shows on
television and the live spectacular on the Music Hall's vast stage
with its 43-foot turntable, 3-ton motorized curtain and 38-piece
orchestra that rises from its pit and moves across the stage. Not
to mention three live camels, and several sheep and donkeys that
bed down in the basement waiting for their stage cues for the
Nativity scene.
   The hard-working Rockettes will do their Christmas show 188
times in the eight weeks of its run through Jan. 3. More than 1
million people are expected to see the show in the cavernous Art
Deco theater that seats 5,874.
   What's changed? Not a lot, except stretch fabrics and punch-in
rhinestones and iron-on sequins. The unforgettable collapse in slow
motion of the line of 36 wooden soldier-Rockettes is pretty much
what audiences of the first Christmas show saw in December 1933.
Variety reported in 1934 that the slow motion had gotten slower.
   Fabrics with added give have made life a lot easier, says
Mitchell, whose work force varies from 6 to 30, depending on the
season. They made the 350 costumes used in the Christmas show, but
her $265,00 budget for this season was only for refurbishing and
making totally new costumes for two numbers out of 12. The
seamstresses are included in the 123 support staff for the 117
actors and musicians.
   Her job is to make clothes that fit the body, move with the body
and reveal as much of it as possible in the case of the
high-stepping Rockettes.
   During the scene preceding ``The 12 Days of Christmas,'' the
women's dressers drop long, puffy-skirted costumes at designated
spots so each Rockette coming off stage in an abbreviated Santa
outfit can strip to her bodysuit and step into a ``12 Days'' dress
almost in a stride. A dresser moves in and zips.
   Actors who switch in a wink from Nutcracker bears who cavort to
Tchaikovsky's ``Waltz of the Flowers'' to dancing Christmas trees
with twinkling lights and green felt arms need fast changes and
freedom to move.

<HEAD>Hanukkah Marks Trimuph Of Religious Rights Over Despotism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The abused and trampled can win. That's the legacy of Hanukkah.
It was demonstrated in the origins of that Jewish holiday and also
resonates in present surges toward religious freedom in communist
lands.
   The point _ that the weak but principled can triumph over the
mighty _ was etched in that ancient Jewish victory which preserved
the ``mother faith'' and also the roots of Christianity and Islam.
   Their rise hinged on the heritage of Hanukkah, whose eight-day
observance begins at sundown Friday. It commemorates the amazing
feat of the Maccabee-led insurgents in overthrowing a
religion-crushing totalitarianism.
   All three major monotheistic faiths _ Judaism, Christianity and
Islam _ ``owe an enormous debt to the Maccabees,'' said Rabbi A.
James Rudin, interreligious affairs director of the American Jewish
Committee.
   ``If that victory had not occurred, the ruthlessness of imperial
power likely would have washed out and eliminated Jewish life as
Jesus knew it,'' Rudin added.
   But in that first war for religious freedom, the groundwork
endured not only for Judaism but also for its two offspring faiths.
   The successful outcome in 165 B.C. came after a lopsided,
three-year war in which relatively small, tattered bands of Jewish
guerrillas finally beat off the world's then mightiest military
power, the Syrian empire.
   ``The courage and faith of the few prevailed over overwhelming
odds,'' said Rabbi Henry Michelman, executive vice president of the
Synagogue Council of America, embracing all three wings of Judaism.
   ``It was the miracle of freedom over tyranny,'' he said, citing
parallels between that event and the emergence of persisting
freedom movements in Eastern Europe.
   ``The whole history of activism and dissent is of minuscule
handfuls of people, through stubbornness and conviction, being able
to resist the mighty empires,'' he added.
   ``The lonely, suppressed voices ultimately are sustained.''
   Rudin said that ``more and more we're seeing the weak overcoming
the strong, the power of an idea. We see it in Czechoslovakia, in
East Germany, Poland and elsewhere. It's the theme of Hanukkah.
   ``Over and over again, the folly of the world is that if
military power is sufficient, it is controlling. But monotheism,
freedom, democracy, have their own greater strength.''
   In the ancient, epic struggle, Syria's despotic Antiochus had
conquered most of the Middle East. He ordered all subjects to
worship the state pantheon of gods, and the destruction of all
vestiges of Judaism.
   Scripture scrolls were burned, synagogues razed, Sabbath
services forbidden. A defiling statute to the pagan Jupiter was
erected in the Jerusalem Temple. Thousands of Jews were slain,
though most complied.
   Pagan altars were erected throughout Israel, and patrols
deployed to force villagers to bow and make offerings to the new
``gods.''
   But revolt broke out when the aging Maccabee, father of five
sons, refused and killed a Syrian officer.
   The Maccabees fled to the hills and gradually gathered a scanty,
ill-equipped but growing army of resistance fighters _ a few
against the Syrian many. But their leader, Judas Maccabee, the
``hammerer,'' said:
   ``In the sight of heaven there is no difference between
deliverance by many or by few. So do not be afraid of them.''
   The long, relentless struggle marked the first successful use of
guerrilla tactics _ lightning strikes and retreats, surprise
attacks, ambushes, night raids and harassment.
   In the final decisive battle, the overwhelmingly outnumbered
Maccabee force of only 3,000 routed a Syrian army of 47,000,
including horsemen, foot soldiers and spearmen mounted on elephants.
   It was a turning point for civilization in the preservation of a
monotheistic religious heritage that has spread around the earth
through its descendant faiths.
   ``In successfully throwing off the yoke of religious
suppression, Judaism was able to go on, and many years later, from
its womb came the other monotheistic faiths,'' Michelman said.
   Those successive events had a ``direct historical correlation,''
he said.'
   After the Maccabean victory, the Jerusalem Temple was cleansed
and rededicated.
   Legend says that there was only enough oil for the Temple lamps
to burn one day but miraculously they burned eight days until more
oil could be made.
   In celebrating the event, Jewish families light an additional
candle each night beginning with the first this Friday evening
until on the final evening the following Friday, eight candles
shine from the menorah.
   Called the ``festival of lights,'' it is not directly related to
Christmas, but they have similar merry traditions of decorative
lights, games and gift-giving.
   They also share that Hanukkah gift that produced them both _ the
perpetuation of religious rights.

   People have an extra reason for celebrating
Christmas this year _ the end of the Cold War between West and
East, says the president of the United Methodist Council of Bishops.
   Declaring the year has seen the ``unfolding of events in the
family of nations which hold the promise of a truly better day for
humankind,'' Bishop Jack Tuell of Los Angeles said in a Christmas
message:
   ``Long-standing repressive regimes have yielded to the cries of
the people for a fuller measure of the freedom and dignity with
which God has endowed all of humanity.
   ``Groups long separated by artificial political barriers now are
coming together to form new relationships of community and
cooperation. The God who is the God of peace and justice and
freedom is surely at work in all this.''

   The Rev. Emilio Castro said in a holiday message:
   ``God in Christ has established forever a token of encouragement
to which all can turn who hunger and thirst for justice, a promise
of peace for all those who are peacemakers, and ... an objective
vision of all who struggle for justice, peace and the integrity of

   The first Roman Catholic Mass from the Soviet
Union to be telecast in the United States will be carried Christmas
eve by VISN, the Vision Interfaith Satellite Network announces.
   Jeff Weber, program vice president for the cable system, says
the service from Vilnius Cathedral in Lithuania will be presented
at 9 p.m. EST Sunday, and repeated Christmas Day at 5 p.m.
   The Mass is to be celebrated by Archbishop Julionas
Steponovicius of Vilnius, believed to have been secretly made a
cardinal by Pope John Paul II in 1979. He was allowed to resume his
church duties only a year ago.
   The 14th-century Vilnius Cathedral, known as the ``cradle of
Lithuanian Christianity,'' was seized by Soviet authorities in the
1950s and converted into a secular gallery, but was returned to the
church early this year.
   VISN is operated by a consortium of 22 faith groups _ Eastern
Orthodox, Jewish, Roman Catholic and Protestant.

<HEAD>TV Critic To Teach English To GI's Kids In Vietnam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At this time last year, Katie Kelly, once an
``Entertainment Tonight'' movie critic, was in Ho Chi Minh City, on
vacation, of all things, spending Christmas in a peaceful Vietnam.
   Now she's spending Christmas preparing to return as an English
teacher for the kids the Vietnam War left in the city then called
Saigon _ the Amerasians, born to Vietnamese mothers and American
servicemen.
   ``The kids obviously have no father and in many cases no mother,
for a number of reasons,'' Kelly says. ``It's a heartbreaker when
you see a whole bunch of them sleeping on the streets of Saigon.
   ``You see these little freckled noses and these little green
eyes, and the curly hair ... my God.''
   Generally shunned by other Vietnamese, they are teen-agers or
young adults now. The youngest would be 14, the war having ended in
April 1975.
   Kelly, who on Dec. 29 will quit her present job as a television
critic here at NBC-owned WNBC-TV, met these children of war
because, as she jokes, ``I take weird vacations. I'm Irish. I don't
go to the beach.''
   She sees the world instead. This took her to Vietnam last year.
Most countries make her think, she says, ``this is nice, I'll visit
again some day. But Vietnam was different. It was, `My God, I've
got to get back here.'
   ``That attitude was prompted by running into these Amerasian
kids. You start finding them in Hue, Da Nang, but they're all over
the streets of Saigon, black and white. I spent a couple of weeks
there, just hanging out with them.
   ``And they are truly remarkable human beings. And they suffer.''
   She learned of an operation set up for the children in Ho Chi
Minh City by a group of Vietnam veterans in the United States.
Based in Wahiawia, Hawaii, and run by a retired Army master
sergeant, John Rogers, it's called Foundation for Amerasian
Children Emergency Support, she says.
   The group's aim is ``to get these kids off the street, get them
food, shelter, some medical treatment,'' she says.
   The Vietnamese government donated a house, she says, ``because
the Vietnamese government is interested in having the people learn
English. I'm a former schoolteacher. So I'll be tutoring these
children in English.''
   The aim is not to ready the young people for when and if they're
allowed to emigrate to this country, although her work would help
that.
   The main goal, she says, is to prepare the Amerasians for when
and if the United States and Vietnam ever resume normal relations.
If that happens, ``there will be Americans over there, and this
would provide future job opportunities for these children.''
   Kelly plans to leave in March. She doesn't know how long she'll
stay. It could be a year or the rest of her life.
   It's a far cry, she says, from growing up in tiny Albion, Neb.,
``out there in corn country,'' and even farther from being a TV or
movie critic at WNBC-TV, then WABC-TV here, then ``Entertainment
Tonight'' and then back at WNBC.
   But the way she sees things, it's payback time.
   ``I'm 53 years old,'' she explains. ``I consider myself the
luckiest human being on the face of the Earth. I've had the best
run of luck the last 10 years, working in television.
   ``I've made a good wage, saved a good deal of money. I'm very
restless, and it's just time to cash in on my restlessness and
maybe do some good. It's time to put a little of it back.''
   While not a victim of the bah-humbug disease that affects some
at yuletide, Kelly feels uncomfortable this Christmas in New York.
The reason: her previous Christmas in Vietnam.
   ``You're surrounded by Christmas here, and it's so commercial,''
she says. ``People are spending all this money, and I keep
thinking, `15 bucks would support one of these kids for a month.'
   ``A woman walked into the makeup room the other night with $100
for gag presents that will be thrown away. That would support a kid
for six months.''

   Today is Friday, December 22, the 356th day of 1989. There are
nine days left in the year. Tonight is the first night of Hanukkah,
the Jewish Festival of Lights.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On December 22, 1944, during the World War II Battle of the
Bulge, the Germans demanded the surrender of encircled American
troops at Bastogne, Belgium. Brigadier Gen. Anthony C. McAuliffe
reportedly replied: ``Nuts!'' The Americans held out until
additional U.S. forces ended the siege four days later.
   On this date:
   In 1775, a Continental naval fleet was organized in the
rebellious American colonies under the command of Ezek Hopkins.
   In 1807, Congress passed the Embargo Act, designed to force
peace between Britain and France by cutting off all trade with
Europe.
   In 1864, during the Civil War, Union Gen. William T. Sherman
sent a message to President Abraham Lincoln from Georgia, saying,
``I beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah.''
   In 1894, French army officer Alfred Dreyfus was convicted of
treason in a court-martial that triggered worldwide charges of
anti-Semitism. (Dreyfus was ultimately vindicated.)
   In 1941, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill arrived in
Washington for a wartime conference with President Roosevelt.
   In 1963, an official 30-day mourning period for President
Kennedy ended.
   In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly voted to ratify the
election of Kurt Waldheim as secretary-general.
   In 1977, 36 people were killed when a 250-foot-high grain
elevator at the Continental Grain Company plant in Westwego, La.,
exploded.
   Ten years ago: Pope John Paul II issued a strong denunciation of
the holding of American hostages in Iran, saying the holding of
hostages was in ``violation of unquestionable principles of
international law.''
   Five years ago: In a case that drew national attention, New York
City resident Bernhard Goetz shot four black youths on a subway
train, claiming they were about to rob him.
   One year ago: President-elect Bush announced more appointments,
including Dr. Louis W. Sullivan as secretary of Health and Human
Services, Samuel K. Skinner as Transportation secretary and Manuel
Lujan Jr. as interior secretary. Brazilian environmentalist
Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes Filho was shot and killed.
   Today's Birthdays: Lady Bird Johnson is 77. TV personality Gene
Rayburn is 72. Former House Speaker Jim Wright is 67. Actress
Barbara Billingsley is 67. Actor Hector Elizondo is 53. Retired
baseball player Steve Carlton is 45. ABC News correspondent Diane
Sawyer is 44. Retired baseball player Steve Garvey is 41. Singers
Robin and Maurice Gibb are 40. Golfer Jan Stephenson is 38.
   Thought for Today: ``A burning purpose attracts others who are
drawn along with it and help fulfill it.'' _ Margaret Bourke-White,
American photojournalist (1904-1971).

<HEAD>Form and Function Meet in Edible Folk Arts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When William Woys Weaver picks up an old, red
clay stewpot or a wooden cookie press, it's the nicks and cracks
that draw his practiced eye.
   ``The form is what I look at first. I like to pick up and see
where it was used, where the scratches are. That's first and
foremost. If I can figure that out, it makes me happy,'' said
Weaver, guest curator for the exhibit ``America Eats: Forms of
Edible Folk Art'' at the Museum of American Folk Art.
   There are no Styrofoam boxes, microwave-ready trays or juice
boxes, but there is a lovely rolling pin of whalebone and mahogany
made by an American sailor around 1850. There's a batter jug
decorated with blue swirls, with two handles and a spout for
pouring onto a griddle. There is an eagle-shaped cookie cutter, and
an intricate cider jelly mold. Many pots are glazed inside to
withstand the acids of pickling or preserving.
   ``America Eats'' traces folk cookery, mostly in the East,
through 135 objects from the 1600s to 1920s. A book of the same
name from Harper &amp; Row looks more deeply into cooking history and
includes 42 recipes adapted to today's kitchens and ingredients.
   The food is functional, hearty, simple: ``Foods that no longer
serve a purpose are quickly forgotten,'' Weaver writes.
   He celebrates the simple: ``Toast, properly done, was one of the
unsung accomplishments of American folk cookery. It was a culinary
art form reduced by its very nature to the perfection of classic
simplicity. It represented a craftsmanship in folk cookery that has
little to do with ornament.''
   An original recipe for Maryland biscuits directs: ``Beat the
dough with an ax for half an hour, until the dough is soft or until
it breaks when pulled.'' The modern version still requires beating,
but with a rolling pin.
   The exhibit inludes a wooden roller contraption called a break,
which cuts the beating time in half, for either recipe.
   Little has been written about folk cooking, so there are plenty
of misconceptions, such as the labeling of many old stewpots as
chamber pots.
   ``We always assumed people cooked everything in these old cast
iron boilers. But a lot was done in ceramics,'' said Weaver, who is
trained as an architect and found himself working increasingly on
kitchens and food.
   Iron cookware came into vogue as cooks had to deal with the more
intense heat of iron stoves.
   ``More than any other single force, the cookstove brought a
radical change to the art of cookery,'' Weaver writes. ``The rules
that applied in the past, the techniques and oral tradition that
had been relied on for centuries, were suddenly obsolete.''
   And toward the end of the 19th century, the tin can made food
available away from its source. ``There was a mysterious virture, a
sense of impending progress, once Americans discovered that they
could put folk culture into a can,'' Weaver writes.
   Folk art has enjoyed a new popularity today, and folk cooking
has benefited from that as well as from a heightened interest in
food.
   ``We are looking at the kitchen a lot today because there is an
immense interest in cooking, regional cuisines, women's studies.
All of this has given it a respectability it hasn't had before,''
Weaver said.
   Many people, he said, are attracted by the sense of nostalgia;
others, perhaps fed up with today's quick food, are drawn by the
craftsmanship.
   ``Things are so rootless today. These are kind of touchstones.
It reminds people of their backgrounds, their grandmothers,
great-grandmothers,'' giving the sense of connectedness that is a
major theme of Weaver's book.
   Food plays an essential role in the search for connectedness, he
said.
   ``If I moved away, I could still make my Pennsylvania Dutch food
in Seattle, or wherever. It's inside me like my spirit. I don't
think anything comes as close as food.''
   And connections are on several levels. A folk cook is connected
to the fuel and water supply, aware how much effort it takes to
keep water hot for washing, said Alice Ross, an expert in hearth
cooking from Long Island. The cook also is connected to the
regional foods available to her, to her family or community.
   Food also connected people to major events, and Weaver writes of
funeral biscuits, Election Day cakes and New Year's cakes, as well
as to the seasons. And it connects people over time, from ``Indians
using corn right down to popcorn and Fritos. There's a
continuity,'' Weaver said.
   ``There is a great interest in ethnicity,'' Ross said. ``As
things have disappeared more, you get to the third and fourth
generations of families, they don't really want to have lost all
that's been lost.''
   One reason folk cooking has been of interest to professionals
only for the last 20 years or so was that it was woman's work,
Weaver and Ross said.
   ``It wasn't something that was professional. It was in the
home,'' Weaver said. With one exception, ``I found nothing that I
could honestly say had been made by women for their own use. I
could not find any women tinsmiths or potters.''
   He included in his exhibit a basket made by black women in South
Carolina _ the only item made by blacks.
   But while the nation was polarized over slavery, many people
refused to use ingredients produced by slave labor, a boycott,
Weaver noted, not unlike modern-day protests. Boycott recipes, such
as Wisconsin cake made without molasses or sugar, became part of
the folk repertoire. ``This kind of current is always there in
food,'' Weaver said. ``And it's helpful to know why there was no
molasses or sugar in that honey tea cake.''
   ``America Eats: Forms of Edible Folk Art'' runs through Feb. 4.

   A quick reality check on the 1990s.
   It was the decade Ted Kennedy announced his clan's goal for the
21st century: a million Kennedys by the year 2050.
   It was the decade Raisa Gorbachev kicked her husband out of
office and capitalized the Soviet Union with the slogan: ``Let's go
shopping.''
   It was the decade that Bennie, the retarded gofer on ``L.A.
Law,'' became chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Wasn't it?
   Tony Hendra and Peter Elbling hope so. The two
satirists-turned-prophets have just published ``The '90s: A Look
Back,'' a retrospective on the decade whose catch-phrase was _ will
be _ uh, might be? _ ``Have a nice millennium.''
   In putting together the book, ``one thing that emerged was a
certain kind of attack on creeping niceness, the feeling that
everything is coming out all right,'' Hendra said in a telephone
interview.
   ``Dan Quayle will be running in 1996 and it's the perfect slogan
for him, `Let's all have a nice millennium together,''' said
Hendra, a former editor of National Lampoon who played the band
manager in Rob Reiner's rockumentary spoof, ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
   Hendra and Elbling gathered more than 75 writers and artists to
produce their pseudo-history, including author George Plimpton,
comics Bill Murray and George Carlin and playwright David Mamet.
   In their world, things to come include social unrest by the
second-homeless, middle-income Americans who can't afford summer
homes; monster Alka-Seltzer tablets dropped into mountain lakes to
solve the acid rain problem; and a National Weather Service
announcement that trailer parks cause tornadoes.
   Geraldo Rivera is elected president, and declares that his
inauguration was ``my first public appearance in 10 years where no
one took a swing at me.''
   ``The line between politics and show business became so blurred
in the '80s,'' Elbling said in a telephone interview. ``If Reagan,
why not Geraldo? If a B-movie actor, why not a B-grade talk show
host?''
   Marilyn Quayle nearly derailed her husband's 1992 presidential
campaign by posing nude. The book includes a picture.
   ``But I wish she had gone to the gym and worked out before she
posed,'' Elbling said.
   Tasteless? Maybe, the editors admit.
   ``But no more tasteless than what's going on in the world,''
said Elbling, who has worked with Chicago's Second City comedy club
and appeared on NBC's ``Cheers'' and ``The Golden Girls.''
   With satire, you're almost bound to offend someone, Hendra said.
``If you don't you're probably not doing a very good job. It's a
sign you're doing the job right when the nitwits and hypocrites get
exercised about something you've written.''
   ``The '90s'' is a sequel to their 1979 book, ``The '80s: A Look
Back,'' edited by Hendra, Elbling and Christopher Cerf _ son of
humorist Bennett Cerf. Elbling said Cerf's schedule didn't allow
him to work on the new book, but he is listed in the credits as
``editor in absentia.''
   In 1979, the editors found they always had to explain what the
title meant.
   ``People asked if we meant the 80s age group, or the 1880s,''
said Hendra. Americans weren't conscious of the ``1980s as an
entity,'' he said.
   With the '90s book, they haven't had to explain the title at all.
   ```Decade-think' has become part of the national
consciousness,'' he said. ``Even the lowest form of intelligence,
airline magazines, are doing stories about the '90s.''
   Published by Avon Books, the book uses issues of the late '80s
to extrapolate the future. In response to President Bush's call for
a ``kinder, gentler nation,'' America introduced the low-voltage
electric chair. In 1994, the issue of dumping medical waste at sea
came to a climax when an entire operating room _ complete with
comatose patient _ washed ashore in New Jersey. The disease of the
'90s was CHIPS _ Computer Human Infectious Parasitic Syndrome _ the
transfer of computer viruses to the human nervous system.
   And the economic war with Asia took a twist when the CIA
recommended that Japan vaporize two American cities with small
atomic bombs in August 1995 to stimulate new U.S. economic growth.
The Japanese refused, saying they had no nuclear bombs.
   ``If you can say that some frightful thing has already happened,
you do it with the hope that people will laugh and then not let it
happen,'' Hendra said.
   Hendra and Elbling talk as if they're really living in the year
history's odometer clicked around to three zeros. They consider the
'90s a done deal, with their book standing as the decade's
definitive history.
   ``We feel as if we've lived through the '90s and we feel an
obligation to share our insights,'' Elbling said.
   Hendra and Elbling kill off a good share of today's public
figures _ Queen Elizabeth is beheaded by Margaret Thatcher; Lauren
Bacall, Rex Reed and other Dakota apartment dwellers are murdered
by Yoko Ono so she can buy their co-ops; and Dan Quayle
mysteriously ascends into heaven during a ski trip.
   ``Disposable people make good jokes,'' says the book's
introduction.
   In fairness, the book also brings back some of history's dead:
``We know Nostradamus' predictions that the dead would rise from
their graves as the Millennium approached were true; and we have
Nostradamus himself to prove it.''
   The decade ends with a public suicide by Donald Trump _ who has
become a trillionaire recluse with shoulder-length hair and gnarled
finger nails _ a shot literally heard 'round the world.
   ``I think Don's much too busy ransacking parts of the globe to
take much offense at anything we might write about him,'' Elbling
said.
   Some predictions in the book already are coming true, in
principle if not in fact.
   ``The '90s'' predicts the Berlin Wall will be torn down. In the
book, though, the wall is moved to Central Park to separate blacks
from whites in another divided city, New York.
   And Eastern Europe's shift away from communism is
well-represented. After seizing power, Raisa Gorbachev proclaims
``a softer, fluffier'' Soviet nation as a brigade of washer-dryer
combinations rolls by in the first Maytag Day parade.
   The three zeroes in the year 2000 could be the key to
understanding the decade, Elbling said. The noughts could signify
the start of the third millennium, or they could be read as,
``oh-oh-oh,'' exclamations signaling the end of the world.
   ``Nobody knows if we'll even be here in 10 years,'' he said.
``Everything could come to a crashing halt or a crashing bang. That
`oh-oh-oh' kind of sums it up.''
   Hendra said those ``ohs'' are a problem for the book he wants to
do 10 years from now.
   ``What do you call a book for the year 2000? The `Oh-Ohs: A Look
Back'?'' he said. ``I'll cross that millennium when I come to it.''

   For thousands in the area devastated by
Hurricane Hugo, the traditional Southern Christmas Day feast will
come in a cardboard box donated by the Salvation Army. So much has
been lost by so many, and yet the spirit of the season shines
through.
   It's there in Christmas lights twinkling for the first time in
Charleston's Historic District; it's there in acts of kindness,
small and large.
   ``I wanted to do something to help. This seemed the best thing
to do,'' Ray Cook said as he helped wire a new house in Mount
Pleasant for Elizabeth Edwards, who lost her home to Hugo's 135 mph
winds.
   Cook, who lives in Aiken, and a friend, Bruce McLauchlin of
Hopewell, Va., spent a week of this month helping build the
832-square-foot house. Both the home and their labor were donated.
   The new house is ``the best thing that's happened in my whole
life,'' said Mrs. Edwards, who hopes to move in with her niece and
her niece's daughter by Christmas.
   Meanwhile, donated toys are pouring into the state from across
the nation to provide a brighter Christmas for other families hit
hard by the storm.
   At least 30,000 toys have been contributed and social service
officials say the total should climb much higher as Christmas nears.
   Five days before Christmas, the Toys for Tots campaign in
Charleston had received 18,000 toys _ 10,000 more than it
distributed last year _ and hundreds more were expected, said Staff
Sgt. Ozell Register, chairman of the Marine Reserve-sponsored
effort.
   Another collection effort was launched by a Beaufort couple, Bud
and Evelyn Culbertson, after their 6-year-old daughter, Leea,
started crying when she saw pictures of Hugo's devastation.
   ``She was concerned about the kids. She wanted to give away all
of her toys,'' Culbertson said.
   The family has collected about 15,000 toys since late September,
he said.
   Meanwhile, there's still a keen demand for food, furniture,
blankets and kerosene heaters among storm victims three months
after Hugo slammed into South Carolina at Charleston on Sept. 21,
said Capt. Jim Worthy, the Salvation Army commander for Charleston.
   The storm left 29 dead in South Carolina and $6 billion in
damage.
   Last Christmas, the Salvation Army donated about 1,600 Christmas
baskets containing food for a family of four for a week. This year,
about 4,500 will be distributed. But, Worthy said, the demand will
continue long after Christmas.
   ``We have adequate food right now. We're getting a lot of
Christmas help. Traditionally, after Christmas it will stop and
that's when the real crunch will come,'' he said.
   In Charleston, Christmas lights have blossomed in places they
were never seen before _ on the palmettos along Broad Street and
lining the old Citadel building on Calhoun Square, making the
structure look like a fairy tale castle.
   ``We decided to do everything possible to show Christmas,'' said
Howard Chapman, coordinator of the city's relief effort. ``I think
people appreciate that. It gives them something to look forward to
and the children the hope the community is coming back.''
   Part of the display is the 89-foot Norway spruce which dominates
King Street. Strung with a mile of lights, the tree is believed to
be among the largest Christmas trees in the nation.
   ``This is a very special Christmas for all of us in our
community,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. told thousands who turned
out for the tree lighting. ``Our community has shown we have the
Christmas spirit. I saw people who lost their homes who were
concerned about their fellow man. This year we have so much thanks
_ so much to be thankful for.''
   While the displays are helping weekend shopping business,
there's concern that seasonal business is lagging because of a
misconception that downtown buildings were gutted by the storm.
   Kris Holmes of the Market Area Merchants Association said the
association's 250 members are taking out ads _ in addition to
regular holiday advertising _ to dispel that misconception.
   Meanwhile, business at suburban shopping centers is brisk.
   Sales are up from last year, said Shirley Webb, assistant
manager of the Children's Palace store in West Ashley.
   ``My personal opinion is it's because of the hurricane,'' she
said. Customers are ``making up for some of the inconveniences,
especially for the children, and they're going to make this
Christmas better than before.''

   Like other mothers, Fifi Reed can't give her
son everything he wants for Christmas. She got 9-year-old Tarek his
favorite Transformer robots but his fondest wish is not to be.
   She can't bring his father home.
   ``Christmas was very special for my husband,'' said Mrs. Reed.
This will be the fourth Christmas in captivity for Frank Reed, one
of the eight American hostages in Lebanon.
   ``He would start getting things ready a month ahead of time.
He'd have the Christmas carols on every day and plan on who we're
going to invite. He would cook the turkey himself.''
   For Mrs. Reed, a Syrian national, and Tarek, it is their first
Christmas in America, far from friends and from husband and father.
   ``I miss him a lot,'' said Tarek, who uses the present tense
when relating memories of his father.
   ``He usually sees me when I play with the turtles,'' said Tarek,
referring to his pets. ``We usually walk on the grass and talk.''
   Reed, the American director of the Lebanese International
School, was kidnapped Sept. 9, 1986. Tarek wasn't quite 6 then.
   Now, the boy and his mother plead the case of the hostages
wherever they can, from the Glenwood School where Tarek is in the
third grade to university halls to the White House.
   ``Dear Mr. Bush, please free my father,'' he began a letter to
the president. He signed it, ``Your friend, Tarek Reed.'' His
classmates wore yellow ribbons and wrote similar letters to
President Bush but there has been no reply. Tarek brought in a
9-by-12-inch photo of his father and showed it to his classmates.
   ``That was touching.'' said his teacher, Trudy LaSpina. ``He was
very proud. He was pleased with what we were doing.''
   These are the two faces of Tarek: A boy propelled far beyond his
age trying to face the realities of the civil war in Lebanon (``The
last time when the bombings started, everyone thought it was
thunder,'' he said). A kid in his natural world of fantasy where
toy dinosaurs and robots are the good guys he often talks about in
the games he plays.
   During a religious ceremony, he placed a photo of his father
beneath a ``Tree of Freedom,'' a Christmas tree decorated in memory
of the eight American hostages. In the next instant, while a
private Mass was being said for the hostages in a home, Tarek was
in the next room drawing in a coloring book with 7-year-old
Michael, his newfound friend.
   If anything, Tarek is doing better than his mother in these
painful times. He walks to school alone, something that would have
been unheard of in Beirut. Recently he went around the neighborhood
selling candy bars for a school fund-raiser, astounding his mother.
He's forgotten much of his Arabic.
   ``It's just like he was born here,'' said Mrs. Reed. ``He has
friends. He goes around so sure of himself.''
   But the 38-year-old woman said she is not adjusting well. ``I'm
not young. When you come to a country and you're young, you adjust
easily. ... Everything is so different, the customs, the habits.''
   Mrs. Reed said she is not alive, she is only existing. ``People
tend to think you're fine, you're just as happy as other people
are. But it's not true because we're not. You can pretend to be
happy but deep inside you're not that happy. You want your husband
around and you want the comfort of a family.''
   Mrs. Reed and Tarek came here last summer on vacation but they
stayed when fighting intensified in Beirut and it appeared the
schools there would not open for the fall term. She moved in with
her mother-in-law in Malden and took a job with an insurance
company in Boston, a 30-minute commute.
   As she waits and hopes for her husband's release, her emotions
rise and fall.
   ``There are days when you think it's going to happen and it's
getting close. And there are days when it's just getting out of
hand, it's getting impossible, `Aw come on, come on, come on. What
is going on? Let's do something.'
   ``I'm angry. Who gave them (the captors) the right to do this?
Where's the justice? By what right can the people take somebody's
life and decide they're going to put them in jail? Why?''
   In the midst of these thoughts, she had asked herself, ``How
much more can I take?''
   Jean-Paul Kauffmann, a French journalist who was released by
pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem captors in May 1988, told her about the
treatment of the hostages, and she said it ``just blew my mind.
   ``They'd be blindfolded most of the time. They'd be shoved the
food in a dirty dish under the door a lot of times. If they caught
them talking to each other, they would beat them.''
   She agonizes over how her husband is holding up, the condition
he will be in when he is released. ``How much sanity are they
retaining, being there three years? I don't know. ... Is the person
going to come out normal? Frank is not young. He's 56.''
   The thoughts that race through her mind are not all haunting.
There are the good memories of how they met and married in 1977
when she was in training as a teacher at the International School.
And they were the best of times, as the couple faced together the
objections of her parents because he was American and Protestant
and she was Syrian and Moslem. He later converted to her religion.
   ``We had to try to convince them we wanted to get married. We
were just the right people for each other. This is the time I
remember. We just had a great time together. I used to say, `It's
too nice to be true,' and it was too nice to be true. It ended all
of a sudden.''

   Outwardly, it's been Christmas as usual: shops filled, trees
flocked, lights strung. But for many people in places scarred by
disaster, this has not been an ordinary holiday season.
   This Christmas will be more deeply felt and longer remembered by
those who were touched by the northern California earthquake, the
Alaska oil spill and the tornado that killed nine schoolchildren
near Newburgh, N.Y.
   _In San Francisco, the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide Memorial
Methodist Church said this holiday season presents special
challenges to those who suffered losses in the October earthquake.
   ``No one should be homeless on Christmas Eve and Christmas
Day,'' he said. ``And we've decided anyone who needs a place, we're
going to put them up.''
   Glide has been raising money to pay for rooms at local
residential hotels to house up to 1,000 people. The church also
planned to hand out more than 9,500 bags of groceries and 5,000
toys, and feed more than 6,000 people on both Christmas Eve and
Christmas Day.
   Some Bay Area charities complained that the surge of giving
after the quake has subsided, even while the need remains strong.
At the Volunteer Bureau of Santa Cruz County, spokeswoman Maria
Norena said collections have been meager for new clothing and toys.
And, she said, ``This year we need it more than ever.''
   _In Alaska's port city of Valdez, site of the nation's worst oil
spill last March, a dreary, rainy summer has given way to a dreary,
slushy winter.
   The community's population ballooned to about 13,000 people from
its normal 3,000 during the summer's cleanup frenzy. This winter,
the number has shrunk to about 4,000.
   ``I think there's kind of a letdown after a busy summer,'' said
City Manager Doug Griffin. ``I don't think that is necessarily bad.
I think after all the activity, people need to catch their breath.''
   City Councilman Dennis Holtz, who owns the Food Mart, said his
sales have been strong. ``But I'm sensing the community is not
upbeat,'' he added. ``I think people are tired from the long
summer, and the spirit, the Christmas spirit, is not present. I
just think everybody's beat.''
   _In Newburgh, the Rev. Ted Bechtel of First Reformed Church said
people are beginning to put the tragedy at East Coldenham
Elementary school behind them, ``although we all realize it's going
to be with us a long time.''
   ``For a lot of the families involved and others in the
community, it's going to take a lot of the edge and joy off of
Christmastime,'' Bechtel said. ``But kids get caught up in the
season and the time of year and are generally doing well.''
   One of those killed, 8-year-old Peter Orsino, had attended
Sunday school at Bechtel's church.
   Peter's family is ``handling it pretty well,'' Bechtel said.
``They have other children and they're trying to celebrate a normal
Christmas. But I know another family, they don't want to decorate,
they don't want to celebrate Christmas at all.''

<HEAD>Democracy Brings Challenges, Opportunities to Church in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic changes sweeping across Eastern Europe are making it
easier to practice religion, but church officials foresee a new set
of challenges in the suddenly more open religious marketplace.
   ``The new market for destructive religious cults will be Eastern
Europe,'' said Rabbi A. James Rudin, interreligious affairs
director of the American Jewish Committee. ``This will be an area
of people who are in a sense almost innocent to the claims of
cults.''
   And in the land where Martin Luther nailed his 95 theses to a
church door in Wittenberg in defiance of Roman Catholic authorities
in 1517, starting the German Reformation, church members are
demanding new freedoms, including the right to participate in the
church's decision-making.
   People are asking if ``the new thinking and openness is valid in
society is it not valid for church structures?'' said the Rev.
David Nelson, Vienna-based secretary for Europe of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America.
   The new freedoms, from open borders to reduced restrictions on
worship and church membership, were fought for by most of the
churches themselves, and are generally welcomed.
   Last week, government officials in Czechoslovakia said they were
drafting laws to ensure freedom of religion. Soviet Leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, who met with Pope John Paul II this month, has
pledged a new law guaranteeing freedom of worship, and steps have
already been taken to clear the way for legalizing the banned
Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   Church members who once faced restrictions ranging from the loss
of coveted civil jobs to imprisonment are eager for the laws to
change, according to Western observers.
   ``There certainly is an opinion that the changes now under way
in Eastern Europe are very favorable to the work of the Christian
church,'' said Nelson.
   But with the new opportunities, U.S. experts say, come a host of
new challenges, particularly in nations where the majority
religious group enjoyed a special status as the only independent
institution.
   In a paradox, the Lutheran church in East Germany and elsewhere
found that being stripped of its power over the last 40 years freed
the church to focus on its mission of being an advocate for the
powerless, said the Rev. Steven Boehme who spent 2{ years in East
Germany for the National Council of Churches.
   ``In their weakness was indeed their strength. And further from
the seat of power is closer to the heart of things,'' said Boehme
of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), who returned home
Oct. 30.
   ``The church will have to reflect on what it has learned in the
last 40 years.''
   He said he hopes the church under the new freedoms welcomes more
plurality within its ranks and becomes ``the voice of those left
behind'' during any hardships that result from economic reforms.
   Nelson said clergy and laypeople who have quietly accepted the
actions of church leaders over the decades are beginning to
scrutinize church hierarchy more, particularly church officials who
were viewed as collaborators with the old regimes.
   In that way, they are starting to catch up with decades of
theological changes in the West giving greater authority to lay
members of congregations.
   But Gerard Powers, an adviser on Eastern Europe in the Office of
International Justice and Peace of the U.S. Catholic Conference,
said many churches in Eastern Europe have had to rely on pre-World
War II theological texts, and are not up-to-date on even major
changes such as the Second Vatican Council in the early 1960s.
   ``In general, there's no doubt because of the restrictions on
the Catholic Church in Eastern Europe and other churches, one
effect of that is the church has not kept up with changes in the
universal church,'' Powers said.
   Rabbi Rudin expressed concern about ``residual anti-Semitism.''
He cited the controversy in Poland over delays in the promised
removal of a Carmelite convent from the edge of the Auschwitz death
camp and derisive remarks by East German and Hungarian leaders
about the ``Jewish media'' and ``rootless cosmopolitans,'' which he
called old code words for anti-Semitism.
   ``As we move to a global village, religious commmunities will
have to live and work together in ways we have not done before,''
said Rudin, who was in Poland in the fall organizing conferences
between Catholic and American Jewish leaders.
   Still, U.S. observers look ahead hopefully as change unfolds in
Eastern Europe.
   ``Religious freedom can only benefit all the churches there,''
said Powers, ``and we should celebrate it.''

<TEXT>
   Withstanding parodies and put-downs, President
Bush's Thousand Points of Light have flickered from a cryptic
campaign slogan into a federal program to foster the volunteer
spirit in America.
   Not bad, given that Bush himself once confessed he wasn't really
certain what the phrase meant, much as he liked the lilt of the
words.
   So there are a thousand points of light _ at least there are
supposed to be _ glittering from the national Christmas tree on the
Ellipse behind the White House. And the president's point-of-light
lieutenant has been issuing citations recognizing ``daily points of
light,'' individuals and organizations engaged in community service
to help solve social problems.
   ``We will single out the few because they represent the many,''
Bush said. ``We hope that by highlighting their achievements, and
the ways they've found to serve, we can inspire others to serve.''
   And yes, there is a point-of-light man at the White House. C.
Gregg Petersmeyer, a Denver businessman who worked in the Bush
campaign, is director of the Office of National Service; his
assignment is to mobilize the campaign for volunteer efforts. The
administration will be seeking congressional backing for a Points
of Light Initiative Foundation, to manage a nationwide drive to
enlist people in community service.
   The government already has programs to organize volunteer
efforts, among them VISTA, ACTION, and the Older American Volunteer
program. Congress approved an extension of those programs through
1993 just before adjourning this year.
   Bush is expected to ask Congress to provide $25 million in each
of the next four years to help finance the foundation, with
matching amounts to be sought from private donors. The goal,
according to Petersmeyer, will be to encourage every citizen to get
involved in at least one community service activity. Every business
also will be asked to join the effort to mobilize volunteers to
cope with hunger, homelessness, drug abuse, juvenile crime and
other social ills.
   The president appointed an advisory committee headed by retiring
Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey to plan the foundation and work on
the legislation to create it. At its first meeting, Petersmeyer
told the five members that power is flowing from the government to
the people with the effort to promote volunteerism.
   The panel is to meet again next month to deliver its final
report to Bush.
   So far, as least, the points of light do not seem to have
multiplied, despite the president's emphasis on volunteer efforts.
A Gallup poll conducted six weeks ago showed no measurable increase
in charitable or social service activities during the past two
years.
   According to that survey, 41 percent of Americans say they are
involved in volunteer work. Two years ago it was 39 percent. The
numbers go up sharply when the question is of charitable
contributions rather than volunteer work. More than 70 percent said
they had made donations to charity in the past year.
   The phrase that has become the Bush theme on voluntary efforts
dates from his speech to the Republican National Convention in
1988. Bush ticked off names of 10 organizations, from the Grange to
the Business and Professional Women of America, and called them all
elements in ``a brilliant diversity spread like stars, like a
thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky.''
   ``I will keep America moving forward, always forward, for a
better America, for an endless enduring dream and a thousand points
of light,'' he said as he concluded.
   Speechwriter Peggy Noonan is credited with writing the line.
   Bush grabbed it and ran, although he tripped now and then as he
repeated the refrain during the campaign. He spoke of ``a thousand
points of life,'' and of ``a thousand shining hills.'' And at
first, he acknowledged that he couldn't define exactly what it
meant.
   But eventually, practice made perfect.
   When Gov. Michael Dukakis complained in a campaign debate that
``I don't know what that means,'' Bush said that was typical of
big-spending liberals who think the government should do
everything. He said he was talking about the enormous number of
people and organizations willing to help others.
   It was part of his inaugural address, ``a thousand points of
light ... all the community organizations that are spread like
stars throughout the nation, doing good.''
   Now it is part of his administration.

<HEAD>Psychological Techniques Can Help Solve Crimes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At first, the woman couldn't remember if the
suspicious-looking man she saw near the murder scene wore any
jewelry.
   But a few minutes later, as she concentrated on her recollection
of him turning his head to the side, she remembered a gold earring.
   That memory helped solve the case, says psychologist Ronald
Fisher, who interviewed her at the request of police. The payoff
came from an experimental technique called the cognitive interview,
aimed at getting crime victims and witnesses to remember more than
under standard police questioning.
   The technique is one of several contributions psychology
researchers hope will help solve crimes and convict criminals.
   Much of this work has been done only in laboratories. But the
cognitive interview recently showed promise in a real-world test
with detectives at the Metro-Dade Police Department in Miami.
   It ``proved to be real fruitful,'' said police Sgt. Jim Wander.
``The guys who took part in it are appreciative of the results, and
I think they're probably better detectives overall as a result of
it.''
   Results were reported in the October issue of the Journal of
Applied Psychology by Fisher and Michael Amador of Florida
International University and R. Edward Geiselman of the University
of California, Los Angeles.
   By analyzing interviews with robbery victims and witnesses, they
found that seven detectives trained in the technique elicited 47
percent more information than before training, and 63 percent more
than did nine untrained detectives.
   The technique involves asking fewer questions than a standard
interview, putting more burden on the witness to actively generate
information rather than simply respond to queries, Fisher said.
   Among its strategies is to discern the witness' job or hobby
interests, which might indicate details he is more likely to
recall. A clothing designer might be able to describe in detail
what a suspect was wearing, for example.
   The witness is also asked to recall his emotions and thoughts at
the time of the crime, because studies suggest that will help
recollection.That can be tricky in the case of a victim who was
frightened by the crime, Fisher said.
   The interviewer also asks the witness what happened, not so much
to get information as to determine the witness' vantage point in
seeing the crime and the ``mental pictures'' he has of it. The meat
of the interview lies in asking the witness to recall the event,
one mental picture at a time, and probe each picture for detail as
it unfolds.
   For example, if a suspect initially approached the witness and
then walked away, the witness should be asked about the suspect's
face only while recalling the approach. Questions about the back of
the suspect's jacket should wait until the witness has moved on to
recalling the departure.
   The technique has ``a lot of promise,'' said Gary Wells,
chairman of the psychology department at Iowa State University and
the author of a handbook on eyewitness identification for police.
   But he and Elizabeth Loftus of the University of Washington have
some reservations. For example, the interview combines several
techniques, and it is not clear which produces the results. Finding
that out might help researchers determine when to use the interview
and when not to, Wells said.
   Loftus also questioned whether the extra details recalled during
the cognitive interview are important. ``Some of them are
important, some of them are not,'' replied Fisher. ``I go for all
the information I can get.''
   Wells said more tests of the technique are needed.
   Another line of memory research deals with the risk that a
victim or witness will falsely identify an innocent person. Several
hundred people a year may be falsely convicted of felonies in the
United States through erroneous identification, said Ken
Deffenbacher, a psychology professor at the University of Nebraska
at Omaha.
   Laboratory experiments have shown two strategies useful in
reducing the risk of false identifications in police lineups, Wells
said. Lineups include a person suspected by police and several
people who generally resemble him.
   In one strategy Wells studied, the witness is shown a ``blank''
lineup which, unknown to him, does not contain any suspects. If he
fingers somebody, he is discarded as unreliable.
   In the other strategy, the witness is shown one person at a time
and asked if it is the right person. In the laboratory, this
technique reduced false identifications by 20 percent to nearly 40
percent, Wells said.
   But Lt. Ron Lewis of the robbery-homicide division of the Los
Angeles Police Department said he considered the ``blank'' lineup
unnecessary because a regular lineup can already expose an
erroneous witness if the witness fails to choose the suspect. He
also said the district attorney generally will not file a complaint
against a person identified by only one witness; corroborating
evidence or multiple witness identifications are generally needed.
   On another aspect of eyewitness reliability, studies show that
people do more poorly in identifying people of a different race
than of their own, said Florida State University psychologist John
Brigham. His recent analysis of 14 studies involving blacks and
whites found the problem affected each race about equally. ``A lot
of people had assumed that whites would do worse with blacks than
blacks would do with whites,'' Brigham said.
   The reason for the problem is not clear. The observer's degree
of racial prejudice doesn't seem to make a consistent difference,
and evidence suggesting the cause is lack of exposure to people of
a different race is ``pretty weak,'' he said. Maybe scientists need
a better measure of exposure, including types of exposure, to
demonstrate such a relationship, he said.
   Brigham suggested that in appropriate cases, jurors be told of
the hazards of cross-racial identification. He also recommended
that lineups be arranged by an officer who is the same race as the
suspect and may be better able to choose people who resemble the
suspect, providing a fairer test of the identification. Police
departments do not appear to do that generally now, he said.
   Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Association
of Chiefs of Police, said he doubts such a practice would be widely
used because of the logistics of having enough officers of the
proper race available.
   Wells said that when he describes his lineup techniques and the
cognitive interview while giving workshops to police, ``they are
quite impressed with the kinds of findings that we're coming up
with.
   ``I really think this is one of the areas of applied psychology
that is making a real contribution and a real difference.''

   In the spirit of Christmas, 8-year-old
Carly Bores is giving a gift that may mean a longer life for other
children with cancer.
   Carly, a blue-eyed, red-haired second-grader, has cancer of the
lymph system. She volunteered, through Marshfield Clinic, for an
international study to test new treatments for cancers in children
and infants.
   When doctors discussed with Mike and Laura Bores their
daughter's Hodgkin's disease, it convinced them to let Carly take
part in the study.
   ``All they can tell us is she has an 85 percent chance of being
disease-free for two years,'' Mrs. Bores said. ``They can't say 10
years or 20 years or a lifetime because they don't have those kinds
of records.
   ``The more information they can gather from more people, the
easier it will be to tell parents things like that in the future.''
   Carly's ordeal also has changed the meaning of Christmas for the
family.
   ``This Christmas, the kids will be seeing less under the tree
and more of me. I need to give more of myself,'' Mrs. Bores said,
sitting in a special home on the clinic campus where parents and
children can live while a child receives radiation treatment. The
family's medical bills total $30,000, most of wich has been covered
by insurance.
   The Children's Cancer Study Group, headquartered at the
University of Southern California School of Medicine in Pasadena,
enrolls 6,000 patients each year and has 25,000 in long-term
research, said Dr. John Weiner, administrative director. More than
100 hospitals, including 32 major medical centers, take par in
CCSG, which was founded in 1955.
   All treatments are assigned by the national headquarters, which
also monitors patient progess and evaluates the effectiveness of
new treatments, Weiner said, adding that the research has led to
dramatic progress in finding a cure for childhood cancers. In 1972,
30 percent of youths with lymphatic cancers lived more two years;
the survival rate is now 80 percent.
   ``If we had the perfect treatment in hand today, we wouldn't
stop these clinical trials for another 10 years,'' he said.
   The risk to patients is low, Weiner said. They either receive an
established treatment with proven results or they may get a better
treatment with the new drug or therapy being studied.
   Carly found out in May she had Hodgkin's disease. Doctors don't
know what caused it other than a ``cell decided to divide wrong,''
said Mrs. Bores, who with her husband, Mike, owns an outdoors
sports store in Three Lakes.
   The couple have one other child, 10-year-old Aaron.
   After 12 drug treatments, Carly started radiation therapy in
early December. For the next two years, she will undergo monthly
X-rays and blood tests to make sure the cancer is destroyed.
Because her spleen was removed, she also must take penicillin every
day for the rest of her life.
   ``Usually, if a second cancer occurs, it is within the first two
years. The longer you go past that two-year mark the better your
prognosis is,'' said Mrs. Bores, adding that the shock of finding
out her child had cancer has made her more patient, more flexible
and probably kinder this holiday season. ``I feel so fortunate that
I can take Carly and hug her and love her.''
   As for Carly, she says the most difficult part of her ordeal was
the surgery when a catheter was installed for chemotherapy. She
knows how serious the disease is because a friend died of Hodgkin's
disease two years ago.
   But this is Christmastime, and she's been getting ready as
though her life hasn't changed at all. There's been cookies to
bake, shopping to do and the excitement of hoping she may get more
coins for her collection.
   ``It's the same as last year,'' she said. ``Christmas is
Christmas.''

<HEAD>Tiny Base Conducts Research for Navy's Newest Attack Submarine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN K. WILEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BAYVIEW, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beneath the surface of Lake Pend Oreille,
scientists are testing technology the Navy hopes will make the new
Seawolf class attack submarines the world's fastest and quietest.
   General Dynamics Corp. last month laid the keel for the first of
the $1.4 billion SSN-21 submarines at its Groton, Conn., shipyard,
said Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith. Asked about specifics of the
work here of the Acoustic Research Detachment, he said, ``Nearly
all that information is classified.''
   The civilian contractor, Tracor Inc. of Austin, Texas, tests
one-fifth and one-quarter scale models of hulls and propellers
here. In general, researchers want to know how much noise is made
by the special steel hull as water flows past and how much the
steel dampens noise made by machinery inside, said George A.
Guedel, the civilian manager.
   ``We are trying to develop technologies for allowing the
submarine to go faster, quieter and still hear others before they
hear it,'' Guedel said.
   A key piece of equipment is the $64 million Kokanee, a
quarter-scale model steered by computer as it sails through an
underwater course. The model is used to test propeller designs
intended to reduce noise, said Jim Scott, a spokesman for the David
Taylor Research Center at Annapolis and Carderock, Md.
   The Acoustic Research Detachment at Bayview is a unit of the
David Taylor Center and is one of six such laboratories for ship
research.
   The base is designated classified, the lowest of three levels of
security. Unarmed guards from a private security company patrol the
grounds. Signs posted on fences and buoys in the lake tell people
not to trespass.
   Bayview, a quiet fishing resort community of about 237 full-time
residents, surrounds the 22-acre base, which is behind a chain link
fence with concertina wire. Otherwise, there is not much to
indicate that the collection of aluminum buildings is a center of
classified research.
   Inside a metal drydock _ its ceiling covered with insulation to
prevent snooping by Soviet infrared satellites _ modifications are
made to the Kokanee and other test models named for Northwest fish
species. Although the Kokanee is inside the building, its aft and
propeller are always covered by a shroud.
   In the middle of the bay, a large, floating metal building is
used to refit hull designs and conduct noise experiments on a
110-ton full-scale model.
   In one series of tests, buoyant hulls called ``vertical flying
models'' are pulled to the bottom of the 1,300-foot-deep lake then
released. As they rise to the surface, technicians using
computer-assisted listening devices learn how much noise they make
as they cruise through the water.
   There are several reasons why the glacier-carved lake is in some
ways better than seawater for testing the acoustic properties of
various metals and equipment, Guedel said. In the middle of the
lake there are 23 square miles of water 1,000 feet deep or more.
The sub-surface temperature stays a chilly 39.5 degrees year-round
and there is less corrosion than in saltwater tests.

<UNK>Franklin Institute To Offer $250,000 Annual Science Award</UNK>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Franklin Institute is looking for a few
good scientists _ to nominate an even better one to be the first
recipient of a new $250,000 annual prize for research benefitting
humanity.
   ``We will be searching for a scientist who, in the spirit of
Benjamin Franklin, has made a discovery that is beneficial to
mankind,'' said Benjamin Franklin National Memorial Executive
Director Larry Tise. ``We will be conducting a worldwide search to
find the right person.''
   The Bower Award for Science will begin next year through a $7.4
million bequest from Henry Bower, a Philadelphia chemical
manufacturer who died last year. A second award will go for
excellence in business leadership.
   ``We hope that the Bower Awards will be recognized as American
prizes comparable to the Nobel Prizes in international prestige,''
said Charles L. Andes, chairman of the institute's board of
trustees.
   Among those who have agreed to help find science candidates are
Erich Bloch, head of the National Science Foundation; Peter
Goldmark Jr., president of the Rockefeller Foundation; Zhou
Guangzhao, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences; M.G.K.
Menon, science adviser to India's prime minister; and University of
Pennsylvania engineering school dean Barry Dean.
   Tise said a special effort would be made to find a Third World
scientist.
   Deadlines for nominations for the 1990 prizes is April 17, the
bicentennial of Franklin's death. The winners will be announced in
September and honored in November in three days of ceremonies in
Philadelphia.

<HEAD>Study Concludes Depression Interferes With Parenting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Babies of depressed women cry more and are
less responsive to their mothers, who in turn are less
affectionate, less sensitive and less attached to their babies, a
psychological researcher says.
   About 26 percent of American women experience a major depression
some time during their lives, and depression seems to be hitting
earlier, when the likely have small children, said University of
Utah psychologist Donna M. Gelfand.
   Gelfand's findings compared 41 depressed mothers who had 3- to
12-month-old babies with 40 non-depressed mothers. The depressed
women were referred by area clinics and therapists; non-depressed
women were chosen from a birth registry.
   Researchers who weren't informed which women were depressed made
three home visits to each, asking questions and observing
interactions with their babies.
   The depressed women were less attached to their babies, less
affectionate and less sensitive to babies' needs, Gelfand said.
They also gave conflicting emotional messages more and gave their
babies lower ratings than did the non-depressed group for being
lively and alert. In one extreme case, a mother was so inattentive
she didn't notice her baby had fallen off her lap. Depressed
mothers lacked confidence in their own effectiveness as parents.
   Depressed mothers tended to issue strict prohibitions instead of
showing or telling the child what to do, she said. This baffles
children, who can't make sense of it, and makes their environment
seem capricious. The child may respond by being fussy and resisting
parents' directives. The child's responses add to the woman's
feeling that she's not a good mother.
   In the second phase of the research, public health nurses are
visiting the mothers weekly for six months to demonstrate methods
of care and discipline, answer questions and provide social support.

<HEAD>Retired Scientist Uses Plants In Organic Home Waste Treatment System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PICAYUNE, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The grass isn't greener over Bill
Wolverton's septic tank _ he doesn't have one. Nor is his home
hooked to a seage treatment system.
   Wolverton's household sewage flows through 50 feet of pipes,
reservoirs and plants along the outside wall of a 1,500-square-foot
addition. The plants grown along large windows eat the organic
wastes, leaving pure, clean water.
   ``I wanted to put it in just to show that it can be done and
this is what will be done on the moon base, if NASA ever builds a
moon base,'' the retired National Aeronautics and Space
Administration scientist said.
   Wolverton's system uses a variation of the ``artificial marsh''
he developed a decade ago. Plants are supported on clay rocks
imported from Germany above reservoirs of wastewater. The end roots
of the plants reach into the wastewater for nutrients and thrive
without fertilizer or watering. The bug problem was corrected by
introducing a few chameleons to the indoor system.
   Wolverton's artificial marsh, in large outdoor versions, is used
by several small towns in Mississippi and Louisiana. The system is
relatively simple to install and, once operating, presents little
or no maintenance costs.
   ``I think, philosophically, that this sort of system would come
closer to meeting the goals of the Clean Water Act than some of the
mechanical systems,'' said Barry Royals, of the state Bureau of
Pollution Control. ``The problem is that a wetlands system is not
the answer to everybody's problem.
   ``An example of that would be if you tried to build a wetlands
system for the city of Jackson. You would take up a good portion of
Hinds County and we know that's not practical.''
   Interest is growing; Japanese officials visited in October and
Wolverton was invited to Holland last month to speak. Things were
different 15 years ago, however, when he told the director of
Mississippi's Bureau of Pollution Control that sewage could be
treated with water hyacinths instead of chemicals.
   ``He said, `If I stopped to listen to every kook who came in
here, I'd never get anything done' and he threw me out of the
office.''

<HEAD>Peter Jovanovich Named President of Publishing Giant Run By Father</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Jovanovich has been promoted to
president and chief executive officer at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
Inc., making him second in command after his father, HBJ Chairman
William Jovanovich.
   The younger Jovanovich, 40, formerly served as executive vice
president of the Orlando-based publishing and insurance company. He
succeeds Ralph D. Caulo, 54, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31.
   Caulo has resigned to ``enter other ventures in central Florida
and in Austin and San Antonio, Texas,'' the company said Wednesday.
William Jovanovich, 69, remains as chairman of the board of HBJ.
   Caulo's position at the publishing gaint has appeared in
jeopardy since last summer, when HBJ announced plans to sell its
six theme parks. The company also said at the time that it would
allow Caulo to leave his post to manage the parks.
   But an HBJ executive close to sale negotiations told the Orlando
Sentinel that Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., which bought the parks in
November for $1.1 billion, wanted to employ its own park executive.
   William Jovanovich, the Sentinel reported in Thursday's
editions, sought to oust Caulo in order to place his son Peter in a
better position to later assume leadership of the company.
   Caulo could not be immediately reached for comment.
   In 1987, HBJ assumed nearly $3 billion in debt to fend off a
takeover bid by British press mogul Robert Maxwell. The sale last
month of its theme parks, including four Sea World parks, to
Anheuser-Busch was made to help pay off that debt.
   With the sale, HBJ reduced its debt by about $930 million to
about $1.63 billion, analysts say.
   Elizabeth Bramwell, an analyst at Gabelli &amp; Co., a New York
brokerage, said she believes Jovanovich's move to the HBJ
presidency ``is a constructive move'' that signals a determination
to turn the company's full attention to publishing, its core
business.
   ``They took their eye off the eight-ball and expense in
publishing and expenses this year got out of control,'' Bramwell
said.
   Ivan Obolensky, senior vice president at Josephthal &amp; Co.,
another New York brokerage, expressed doubt that the promotion of
Peter Jovanovich will make a big difference at HBJ. ``It's not a
big change; it's the leopard changing its spots.''
   Obolensky said he is concerned that HBJ remains vulnerable to a
hostile takeover.
   In his new position, Peter Jovanovich will supervise HBJ's
elementary and secondary school publishing. For the past five years
he has managed HBJ's other publishing businesses, including
university, medical, scientific and trade books, and fiction and
non-fiction titles.
   The younger Jovanovich joined HBJ in 1980 after working for
Macmillian Inc., another publishing house.

   After a bitter, seven-month battle, Unicorp
Canada Corp. and partner Cara Operations have abandoned their bid
for the world's largest doughnut-shop chain, Dunkin' Donuts Inc.
   DD Acquisitions Corp., a partnership between Unicorp's
Kingsbridge Capital Group merchant bank subsidiary and Cara, said
it intends to tender its Dunkin' Donuts shares to Allied-Lyons PLC,
the British food company that made a rival bid last month.
   Dunkin' Donuts has accepted Allied-Lyons' bid of $47.25 per
share, or a total of $325 million, in cash.
   Kingsbridge President Earl Rotman said DD Acquisition had bought
860,000 Dunkin' Donuts shares at an average of $34 each and will
gain $11.4 million by tendering.
   Unicorp Canada Corp. and Cara Operations Ltd. launched their
assault in June, offering $43 per share for a minimum 50.1 percent
of Dunkin' Donuts' 6.85 million shares. The offer was increased to
$45 in August.
   Allied-Lyons' surprise bid was welcomed by management of the
chain, which is based in Randolph, Mass. Dunkin' Donuts had waged a
fight against Unicorp that included the adoption of a poison-pill
takeover defense in May.
   By tendering to Allied-Lyons, Unicorp suffered its second major
defeat this year, having failed to buy the Montreal-based Steinberg
Inc. grocery chain.

<HEAD>Administration Says EEC Proposal Will Spur Farm Negotiations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal by the European Economic Community
to overhaul agricultural trade will clear the way for final
negotiations with the EEC in 1990, the Bush administration said.
   ``This is the last of the major proposals to be submitted and
now will permit the final negotiations on agriculture to get under
way early next year,'' said U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills
and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   However, they added in a joint statement Wednesday, certain
aspects of the EEC proposal cannot be accepted by the United States.
   The comprehensive EEC proposal was made in Geneva in the Uruguay
Round of trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. The GATT negotiations are scheduled to conclude at the end
of 1990.
   ``While the proposal contains some positive indications, we are
concerned with the continued reliance by the (EEC) on managed
agriculture and, in particular, the apparent intention to continue
to rely upon large-scale subsidies and especially export
subsidies,'' the leaders said.
   ``Government programs that manage markets are one of the major
causes of the current trade distortions in agriculture,'' they
said. ``The successful future of trade in agriculture depends on
market liberalization and significant reduction of subsidies that
distort trade.''
   The United States cannot accept the EEC proposal to
``rebalance'' import protection, Mrs. Hills and Yeutter said.
   ``Rebalancing would raise tariffs, reduce market access and
increase the price of food to consumers,'' they said. ``Rebalancing
is simply protectionism by another name, and we believe the other
GATT countries will recognize it as such.''
   Mrs. Hills and Yeutter said the EEC approach ``does little to
liberalize market access'' and that the 12-nation bloc's position
on export subsidies is ``unacceptably weak and totally out of
step'' with other proposals made in the talks.

<HEAD>South Korea Picks McDonnell Douglas FA-18 as Main Warplane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By M.H. AHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korea has chosen the FA-18
Hornet produced by McDonnell Douglas Corp. as its main jet fighter,
a decision worth an estimated $4.4 billion to the U.S. defense
contractor.
   The Hornet won out over another U.S. competitor, General
Dynamics Corp.'s F-16 Falcon, after a lengthy contest.
   The announcement Wednesday came as a surprise. Widespread
reports said the nod would go to the far less expensive F-16. South
Korea already has dozens of F-16s. In the early 1980's, it
purchased 36 of them.
   McDonnell Douglas, based in St. Louis, said in a statement
released in Seoul, ``The Korean decision reaffirms America's
worldwide leadership in the aerospace industry.''
   It estimated the contract would mean more than 20 million man
hours of labor for U.S. workers and $3 billion worth of exports
over the next eight years.
   Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon told a news conference, ``We have
chosen the FA-18s after considering all factors, including safety,
national interest and operational advantage that can help us to
effectively cope with North Korea's fast developing air
capability.''
   The announcement gave no price tag for the project, but industry
officials estimated it was worth at least $4.4 billion. They said
the same number of Falcons would have cost $2.8 billion.
   The deal calls for South Korea to buy or co-produce 120 FA-18s
under its fighter program from 1992-98. Korea plans to buy 12
finished FA-18s, assemble 36 from U.S.-supplied kits, and
co-produce 72 in Korean factories with the help of its U.S.
contractor.
   The Hornet is a single-seat twin-engine jet first produced in
1978. It is used by 30 squadrons in the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps,
and 842 planes have been sold to Canada, Australia, Spain, Kuwait
and Switzerland.
   Its standard combat arms include two heat-seeking Sidewinder
missiles on the wingtips, two radar-guided advanced Sparrow
missiles on fuselage stations and an internally mounted 20mm
machine gun with 570 rounds of ammunition.
   The cockpit is entirely digital, with three color monitors and a
new navigational and radar system for night attacks.
   Some civilian officials supported choosing the cheaper F-16 but
the air force preferred the FA-18s, which it believes can
technically match North Korea's newly introduced Soviet-made
MIG-29s and Su-25s, government sources said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Brig. Gen. Kim Ji-wook said McDonnell
Douglas offered a better deal, including a promise to
electronically upgrade aging Phantom jet fighters now in operation.
   Industry officials expressed hope the plane purchase would help
develop South Korea's civilian aerospace industry. Samsung
Aerospace Industries, an arm of the giant Samsung Group, will be
the main Korean contractor for the military deal, and companies in
the Daewoo and Hanjin groups will participate.
   Under American law, the U.S. Congress will have 50 days to
approve or reject the sale from the time it is formally notified of
the agreement.
   The U.S. government, under congressional pressure, had asked
South Korea to purchase more finished aircraft to help reduce South
Korea's trade surplus with the United States, expected to reach
$4.5 billion in 1989.
   South Korea, bowing to U.S. pressure, also had to lower from 50
percent to 30 percent the portion of the so-called off-set program,
under which the U.S. contractor would buy Korean-made aircraft
parts in return for selling the American aircraft.
   Some U.S. legislators expressed concern over technology transfer
to a nation which can develop its own aviation industry to compete
with American firms.
   McDonnell Douglas officials in Seoul said South Korean air force
people visited the United States twice this year to try out the
airplane, once for six weeks. The company shipped more than a ton
of paper evaluations on the plane to Seoul in September.
   They said delivery of the first planes will depend on how
quickly Congress approves the contract.
   The FA-18 was approved for overseas sales 3{ years ago and is
the top U.S. military plane that can be offered for sale to foreign
nations.

<HEAD>Lang Plans To Make Ms. an Ad-Free Bimonthly Magazine, Names New Editor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ms. magazine is going to be back next spring
without ads and will appear once every other month rather than
monthly, its new owner says.
   Dale W. Lang, whose Lang Communications Inc. assumed control of
Ms. in mid-October, also said Wednesday he had selected a new
editor in chief for the magazine, feminist activist and author
Robin Morgan.
   The magazine, founded in 1972, had not been profitable and often
found itself at odds with advertisers over its editorial content.
   Lang had said publishing the magazine without ads would relieve
it from ``external pressures'' and enable its editorial staff to
concentrate on pursuing issues important to women without concerns
about advertiser backlash.
   The last issue of Ms. magazine was dated November. No specific
date was set for resumption of publication as a bimonthly.
   Lang was said to be unavailable for comment on the le sent a
letter of explanation from Gloria Steinem, a co-founder of the
magazine who remains a consultant to the publication.
   Spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said Ms. Steinem would outline the
plans for Ms. and offer readers a chance to get issues of Working
Woman, Working Mother or similar magazines in the months remaining
before Ms. resumes publication.
   Lang Communications owns Working Woman and Working Mother as
well as the teen magazine Sassy and Success, a magazine for
entrepreneurs.
   Ms. Morgan, the new editor, replaces Anne Summers, who had held
that post since November 1987 and remains as editor-at-large of the
magazine.
   Ms. Summers had been part of a group including management that
bought Ms. and Sassy in July 1988 from the Australian media company
John Fairfax Ltd. Terms of Lang's acquisition of a controlling
interest in that company have not been disclosed.
   Ms. Morgan has written 12 books, including ``The Demon Lover: On
the Sexuality of Terrorism,'' ``Sisterhood is Powerful'' and
``Sisterhood is Global.'' She was a contributing editor to Ms. from
1974 to 1987.
   She was also described as a founder and leader of the feminist
movement in the United States and was a creator of the Sisterhood
is Global Institute, a feminist research organization.
   She was said to be unavailable for comment on her new job.
   Asked why Lang felt a new editor was needed for the magazine,
Ms. Kaplan said he felt ``a new editor will have a fresh
perspective on the magazine.''
   The last issue of Ms. had actress Glenn Close on the cover, but
Ms. Kaplan said the new Ms. would no longer rely on celebrity
interviews or profiles.
   ``It's going to be a hard-hitting, journalistic magazine,'' she
said.
   Industry observers have said they expect Ms. will scale back its
circulation base of 550,000 when it resumes publication.

<HEAD>Panel Praises Fed's Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Banking Committee has defended the
independence of the Federal Reserve Board and praised the central
bank's inflation-fighting program.
   ``A suitable degree of independence for the Federal Reserve is
essential,'' the committee said Wednesday in a report to Vice
President Dan Quayle, adding, ``the Fed's current structure
appropriately provides some insulation from (political) pressures.''
   Reviewing the Fed's attempt to curtail inflation by slowing
economic growth just short of a recession, the committee said,
``This policy has been reasonably successful.''
   It also said the Fed's plan to depress growth slightly next year
in order to achieve modest reductions in inflation ``does not
appear unreasonable.''
   The report comes after several attack's on the Fed's
independence from Bush administration officials and members of the
House.
   President Bush and members of his Cabinet have criticized the
central bank for what they call its excessive concern with
inflation and dampening growth too much. Housing Secretary Jack
Kemp has said the administration and Congress should have more
influence over the Fed.
   He is backed by the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee,
Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., who introduced legislation earlier this
year which would force the Fed to operate more openly and consult
more closely with the administration.
   Earlier this month, House Banking Committee Chairman Henry B.
Gonzalez, D-Texas, said he would launch a major review of the Fed
next year.
   The Senate panel's report was signed by its chairman, Sen.
Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich. Only one of the panel's 20 members
dissented, Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., who is chairman of the
Budget Committee.
   Sasser, in a written addition to the report, said the Fed, which
has eased its tight money policy since June, has been ``not nearly
aggressive enough'' in allowing interest rates to decline.
   ``I think that there is increasing evidence that we may be
sliding into a recession. If this is so, it will be the result of
the Fed's tightening,'' he said.

<HEAD>Wampanoags Gain `Millions' in Phone Bidding Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Wampanoag Indians of Gay Head, Mass., have
dropped a bid to run a Cape Cod cellular phone service in exchange
for ``millions of dollars'' in a settlement with a competing
telephone company.
   NYNEX Mobile Communications, a subsidiary of NYNEX Corp., agreed
to the settlement Wednesday, which clears an obstacle for it to run
a cellular phone servce on the Cape.
   The tribal president said the money will go toward other
economic development programs for the Wampanoags, possibly
including a resort complex on Martha's Vineyard island.
   ``We both got what we wanted, actually,'' said Donald Widdiss,
president of the Wampanoag Tribal Council of Gay Head Inc. ``We
feel we can leverage the money we have to go into other ventures.''
   Those include setting up a museum and cultural center in Gay
Head, a town on Martha's Vineyard and the tribe's home base,
establishing a performing arts center, and possibly developing a
resort hotel complex.
   Neither Widdiss nor NYNEX officials would disclose the exact
amount of the settlement but Widdiss said, ``It's in the millions
of dollars.''
   The Wampanoags began looking at the possibility of running a
cellular phone service in 1987 as a way to generate revenue for the
tribe. While the tribe itself has no equipment or particular
expertise in the field, the Wampanoags had agreed to work with a
cellular phone company based in Hartford, Conn., Message Center
Management. The Hartford firm also got an undisclosed percentage of
the settlement, Widdiss said.
   Permits to operate cellular phone service are awarded by the
Federal Communications Commission. Each region of the country is
divided into service areas and the FCC awards a license to one
company for each area.
   Wednesday's announced settlement came just before the FCC was to
conduct a lottery in which one of the competing companies would be
chosen. Once selected, a company would still have to pass further
government hurdles before winning a license.
   With the announcement of the settlement, the drawing for the
Cape Cod region was canceled.
   NYNEX is the largest cellular phone service provider in New
England, operating in regions extending from southern New Hampshire
to Worcester, Mass., and Rhode Island.
   Widdiss said the possibility of winning a cash settlement from a
competitor ``was part of the strategy'' from the beginning when the
tribe first sought to run the cellular service.
   About 280 Wampanoag Indians live on Martha's Vineyard and the
tribe is renting office space in the town of Gay Head. About 250
acres of land have been put into federal trust for a reservation
where the Indians can build homes.

<HEAD>US Businesses Close Offices, Assess Impact Of Panama Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   American corporations closed offices in Panama and tried to
assess the damage from the surprise U.S. military action that
resulted in the first closing of the Panama Canal in many years.
   Citibank closed its branches in Panama City on Wednesday,
soap-making at the Colgate-Palmolive Co. factory halted and Borden
Inc. shut an ice cream plant.
   Shippers remained calm in the face of the rare closing of the
Panama Canal, which has been shut only for landslides in its
75-year history. A prolonged closure could delay exports of South
American fruit, raise some prices in the United States and force
importers to find alternate routes.
   The number of U.S. businesses operating in Panama has declined
by roughly 30 percent in recent years because of the unstable
political environment and a deteriorating economy. Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., for example, moved its Panama operations to the Cayman Islands
last year.
   Direct U.S. investment in Panama is insignificant, said
Nathaniel Leff, a business professor at Columbia University.
   ``It's not a country like Brazil, where there are (U.S.)
carmakers and drug companies,'' he said. Companies that operate
plants there market Panama-made goods mostly within the country.
   Borden's two factories in Panama City were closed because of
fighting, a spokesman said, but a third factory that makes
processed cheese in the northwest province of Chirique was
operating as usual.
   ``All our properties and people are safe,'' said spokesman Jim
McKinley. ``We don't have a feel for when they will open,'' he said
of the shuttered plants, which make ice cream and powdered drink
mixes.
   A spokesman for Colgate-Palmolive said he did not know when the
company's Panama factory, which makes soap, toothpaste and
cleaners, would reopen.
   Citibank closed its six branches in Panama City early Wednesday.
Spokesman Ken Campbell said the bank was trying to find out how
employees were affected.
   United Brands Co., which owns the Chiquita banana brand, said
operations were normal. But spokesman Peter Fay said the company
``feared for the general safety of our employees.''
   United Brands ships 30 million boxes of bananas each year from
Panama. Fay would not say what percentage travel through the Panama
Canal.
   Exporters found good news in President Bush's announcement that
the United States was lifting economic sanctions against Panama.
   The U.S. military action followed the secret swearing-in of
opposition leader Guillermo Endara as Panama's president. Endara
was widely regarded the winner of May elections but Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega blocked him from taking power.
   At the Port of Houston, where about 15 percent of foreign trade
moves through the Panama Canal, spokesman Lee Vela said exporters
would benefit, but ``we won't know exactly how much until April or
May.''
   According to the Commerce Department, the major U.S. exports to
Panama are cigarettes, aluminum, fuels and perfume.
   The 51-mile canal lost some strategic importance in the 1950s
with the development of supertankers and other ships too large to
traverse its six locks.
   Still, roughly 14 percent of U.S. international sea trade passes
through the canal, government sources said. The canal remains
critical to the shipment of raw materials as well as fruits
exported from South America.
   ``If you're putting copper ore on a freighter that has to go to
Western Europe, it has to go through the canal. Iron ore from
Brazil to Japan has got to go through the canal,'' said George
Zimmerman, an analyst with Gruntal &amp; Co., a New York securities
firm.
   But because traveling through the canal can add as much as a
week to shipping time, only goods that are not time-sensitive move
through the waterway. A hot consumer electronics product from Asia
that has retailers clamoring probably would not move through the
canal, experts say.
   The canal continues to do a lot of business because it is among
the lowest-cost routes. Air transportation is costly, and not all
goods can be shipped from South American ports up the east and west
coastlines.
   Shippers were optimistic that the canal would reopen today.
   General Motors Corp. spokeswoman Karen Longridge said a ship
loaded with Geo Metro and Storm automobiles from Japan was just
outside the canal, resting at sea.
   ``If things don't change in a short period of time, we will
probably send it to the West Coast, unload it and ship it by rail
back to the East,'' she said.

<HEAD>Wang Announces New Strategy of Compatibility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc., which has posted losses
and slashed its work force, has been criticized for having too
limited a product line. But the computer company says it hopes to
change its image by making equipment that uses popular,
industrywide standards.
   ``We're focusing more and more on our customers,'' said Gerry
Paul, Wang's vice president of systems, research and development.
``What they want is a wide variety of applications of software.''
   Analysts said the strategy, announced Wednesday, marks an
important departure for Wang, and it follows a recent trend in
which computer companies have been making equipment that is
compatible across the industry.
   ``Wang traditionally has been a closed, proprietary equipment
company,'' said Steven Wendler, an analyst with Gartner Group Inc.
``For a company like Wang, this movement into open systems is a
very significant philosophical change.''
   Wang said the announcement was part of a general strategy
outlined by company President Richard Miller last month, in which
the Lowell-based firm is trying to pay closer attention to the
needs of its customers.
   In a statement Wednesday, Miller said that by ``adopting
openness both as a product strategy and a state of mind, and
constantly listening to and heeding our customers' directions, Wang
will succeed in its efforts to grow and remain competitive in the
1990s and beyond.''
   Wang's strategy calls for integrating standardized technologies
into its existing product lines and developing new sets of hardware
and software based on popular industry standards such as UNIX and
DOS.
   For the past two years, Wang has been making personal computers
that are compatible with equipment from industry leader
International Business Machines Corp., Paul said.
   But, he added, ``We didn't move as quickly as we should have in
opening up our products.''
   Wang posted a loss of $62.1 million in the quarter that ended
Sept. 30. As part of the company's new focus, Miller announced last
month that Wang would cut 2,000 jobs, in addition to about 5,000
jobs that were eliminated earlier in the year.
   Part of Wang's rebuilding strategy has been to develop so-called
imaging systems, in which documents such as payroll forms or
insurance claims are electronically ``scanned'' and stored in a
computer.
   The documents can be retrieved on a computer screen much as a
VCR reproduces the images of a movie. The technology is aimed at
reducing the time and cost associated with manually filing,
collating and retrieving documents.
   Wang said its focus on openness is being blended with the
imaging technology to ``enable the broadest possible range of
users'' to take advantage of the product.
   Wang said it hoped to further broaden the use of imaging systems
through a licensing agreement, also announced Wednesday, with
Novell Inc., a Provo, Utah, company that makes personal computer
networking systems.
   ``Our goal is to provide universal access to Wang imaging and
integration of information and applications,'' Miller said.
   But while Wang continues to build its market in image
processing, more important is the company's movement away from its
proprietary systems, Wendler said.
   In the next four years, he said, the image processing market is
expected to grow to $3 billion, but open system technologies are
expected to represent a $60 billion market.
   ``The prospects for image processing are bright,'' he said,
``but the prospects for open systems are much brighter.''
   Wang also said Wednesday it had reached an agreement to sell up
to 30 percent of the shares it holds in its Taiwan manufacturing
subsidiary. The buyer was not announced. Wang said the sale of a
full 30 percent of the shares would bring it about $120 million
after taxes.

<HEAD>Kodak Makes Last Payments for Instant Camera Rebates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILARY APPELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Eastman Kodak Co. waits to hear how
much it will be penalized for violating Polaroid Corp.'s instant
camera patents 13 years ago, the company is making its last
payments to customers who bought Kodak's instant models.
   Kodak was forced to stop making and selling instant cameras and
film in 1986 after a federal judge ruled that the Rochester-based
photographic company infringed on seven Polaroid patents.
   Since then, Kodak has paid about $108 million in cash to 3.5
million consumers who bought the company's instant cameras from
1976 to 1986, plus issued them $89 million worth of rebate coupons
on other Kodak products.
   ``It is probably the most successful outreach program to
consumers ever,'' said Chicago attorney Burton I. Weinstein, who
represented camera owners in a class action lawsuit against Kodak.
   ``That's the best return that I've ever heard of,'' said Beverly
Moore, editor of Class Action Reports in Washington, D.C.
   Kodak had sold 16.5 million instant cameras in the United States
by the time Polaroid won its suit. The courts have not yet ruled
how much Kodak will have to pay Polaroid, which is based in
Cambridge, Mass., but stock analysts predict it will be in the $1
billion to $2 billion range.
   Kodak has insisted it should pay only $177 million, or 5 percent
royalties on the instant cameras and film it sold.
   Final arguments in the penalty phase of the trial were filed
Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Boston.
   Camera owners filed a class action suit against Kodak after the
company proposed a settlement with them that did not include cash.
   Attorneys for Kodak and the claimants worked out a settlement
that instead gave each camera owner a cash refund of $19 to $52,
plus rebate coupons worth $18 to $30 for use on Kodak products. The
coupons must be used by Dec. 31 and submitted to Kodak by Jan. 31,
1990.
   Both sides say the settlement process has gone extremely
smoothly.
   ``It's incredible what was accomplished by the efforts of people
who were literally at each other's throats _ Kodak and us,''
Weinstein said. ``Once there was a settlement, Kodak worked
extremely hard to make sure people got compensated.''
   Of the possible claimants, 3.8 million filed claims, 3.4 million
of which were approved, said William J. Campbell, who represented
Kodak in the settlement.
   ``My client spent a heck of a lot of money'' to advertise the
settlement nationwide, he said. ``They went more than the
distance.''
   Weinstein estimated that Kodak spent about $200 million overall
on the settlement, including advertising and attorneys' fees.
Administrative and legal costs were less than 10 percent of the
total, he said.
   Moore called it ``extraordinary'' that nearly 25 percent of the
possible claimants filed claims, particularly since as long as 10
years had elapsed since some people bought their cameras.
   Kodak could not say how many of the coupons have been used.
Spokesman Paul Allen said the company estimated it would spend $42
million to redeem the coupons.
   Kodak expects many of the rebate coupons will be used during the
Christmas season.
   Claimants were divided into four groups according to how much
their cameras cost. People in all but the group that owned the most
expensive instant cameras got back more cash than they originally
spent to buy the camera, Campbell said. All the claimants got more
than the resale value of their used cameras, he said.
   Even if the claimants didn't use their rebate coupons, Weinstein
said, ``they're way ahead of the game.''

   There's not much to the Zube Tube, the
Ultimate Cosmic Sound Machine. But then, there wasn't much to the
Hula-Hoop, either.
   The 39-inch-long brightly colored cardboard tube can produce
sounds from ``Star Wars'' battles and MTV-style echoes to Gregorian
chants, whale songs and the ocean's roar.
   ``The number of noises you want to make are as infinite as your
imagination,'' said Judy A. Walls, senior vice president of Ritam
International, Ltd., a toy company in the southeastern Iowa town of
Fairfield.
   ``There's no batteries, no electricity,'' she said. ``I think
everybody is just `electroniced' out.''
   Inside the 2}-inch diameter tube is a spring that acts as an
acoustic coil. The spring is connected at each end by custom-made
plastic cups. A hole on the side of the tube allows a child's _ or
an adult's _ finger to reach in and pluck the spring, which
produces the myriad of sounds.
   A person can also speak into the hole, as well as either end of
the tube, to produce even more sounds.
   ``We feel it's going to be the next Hula-Hoop. In its first 18
months, they sold something like 100 million hula hoops,'' Mrs.
Walls said. ``We plan on doing the same thing. I think three years
is realistic.''
   Some 200,000 Zube Tubes have been sold since it was marketed in
mid-September, she said. The suggested retail price is $9.95.
   Toy and gift companies in Finland, Switzerland, Germany, France,
England and Canada have inquired about the tube.
   Sandy Watsey, Ritam executive vice president, said that while in
London, a group of company officials went to Harrod's to tape a
video using the department store's Zube Tube display. However, they
ended up filming an empty display because the store was sold out,
she said.
   ``They say over there that the Zube Tube is more popular than
Nintendo,'' Ms. Watsey said.
   The concept of the Zube Tube was developed by Bob Deissler, who
was studying physics at Case Western Reserve University in
Cleveland.
   ``I was playing with a slinky and it happened to touch a
Styrofoam cup,'' said Deissler, who was visiting the 10-year-old
toy company this week.
   Intrigued by the sound, Deissler experimented with a different
type of spring about a year later.
   ``It worked really great. That's when I really decided to pursue
it,'' he said.
   Deissler applied for and received a patent in 1980 and contacted
several large toy companies, but none were interested. Deissler
later moved to Fairfield.
   Ritam snapped up the product and developed the concept. The
company's other claims to toy fame are electronic games called
Monty Plays Scrabble and Master Monty, which sell about 10,000
units a year, Mrs. Walls said.
   Zube Tube beats them hands down. She said the company now is
turning out up to 5,000 Zube Tubes a day.

<HEAD>Hunts Agreed To Lifetime Ban From Futures Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt have
accepted lifetime bans from trading commodities futures and will
pay a $10 million penalty after they emerge from bankruptcy.
   But the Hunts, who officials say came within weeks of cornering
the world's silver market, have neither admitted guilt nor claimed
innocence under terms of the agreement.
   The move will help the brothers speed the settlement of their
personal bankruptcy cases, filed after they lost a court case
stemming from their silver speculation.
   In 1985, the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission filed
a complaint that sought more than $50 million in fines from the
Hunts.
   ``It could have been a very extensive fight and they wouldn't
have had the money to hire attorneys and continue to litigate after
settlement of their bankruptcy cases,'' CFTC attorney Linda Groves
told the Dallas Morning News.
   Bunker Hunt's bankruptcy neared end last week with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Harold Abramson's approval of a reorganization
plan. Herbert Hunt's case may end this week.
   ``We were happy to get the CFTC decision behind us,'' said
Russell Munsch, Bunker Hunt's lead bankruptcy attorney. ``It is one
of those things that Bunker would have liked to have gone and
litigated.''
   Under the agreement, on file in Dallas bankruptcy court, the
Hunts agreed to pay the $10 million penalty out of future income,
gifts and inheritances once they emerge from bankruptcy.
   The terms of the CFTC agreement say the Hunts consent to
findings the brothers violated the Commodity Exchange Act by
manipulating the price of silver.
   CFTC documents on file in Washington claim that ``by the end of
May 1980, (the Hunts) could have owned virtually the entire
available world supply of deliverable .999 silver bullion.''
   The effort collapsed on March 27, 1980, the agency said, when
prices fell from about $50 an ounce to about $10 an ounce.
   The Hunts lost an estimated $1.3 billion in the collapse and
then a series of lawsuits and claims were initiated against them
that toppled their empire.

<TEXT>
   Pending acid rain legislation spurred
Ashland Coal Inc. to spend $143 million to buy the stock of a
southern West Virginia company with low-sulfur coal reserves, the
company said.
   Environmentalists say sulfur in coal contributes to acid rain.
   Ashland Coal agreed late Tuesday to acquire the stock of
Mingo-Logan Coal Co. from BP America Inc., which is selling its
worldwide coal interests.
   Ashland Coal officials said they hope to mine more than 4
million tons of coal annually on the land by 1992, using about 400
employees. It will spend $96 million to develop the land and build
a preparation plant, bringing the total cost of the project to
nearly $240 million.
   ``The Mingo-Logan coal reserves are of exceptional quality,''
said William C. Payne, Ashland Coal's president and chief executive
officer. ``In addition, geologic conditions on the property will
allow us to mine at productivity levels well above industry
averages.''
   The land, owned by a subsidiary of the Norfolk Southern Corp.
railroad, has reserves of about 129 million tons of prime,
low-sulfur coal on about 20,000 acres of land in Mingo and Logan
counties.
   ``Mingo-Logan will give our company access to a new market _ the
power plants served by the Norfolk Southern railroad,'' Payne said.
``Also, it is expected to help us expand our presence in the export
market.''
   A spokesman for BP America said 20 companies made initial bids
for the property. Several sources in the coal industry said there
were three other finalists: A.T. Massey Coal Co., Island Creek
Corp. and AMAX Inc.
   Ashland Coal would break into the nation's top 20 coal producers
for the first time with the additional production, the Charleston
Daily Mail reported. The company expects to mine and sell 10
million tons in 1989.
   Ashland Oil Inc. owns 46 percent of Ashland Coal and 50 percent
of Arch Mineral Corp., another major national coal producer.
   Companies are attracted to southern West Virginia for its
low-sulfur coal reserves, which could prove valuable if Congress
passes strong acid rain legislation.

<HEAD>Gillette Announces It Will Acquire Part of Wilkinson Razors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gillette Co. is helping finance a buyout of
Swedish Match, and in return it will get part of the Wilkinson
blade and razor line.
   Gillette said Wednesday it was joining a group of investors and
a management group of Swedish Match to buy the match, disposable
lighter and Wilkinson blade and razor lines from Stora of Sweden,
the parent company of Swedish Match.
   As part of the deal, Gillette will acquire Swedish Match's
Wilkinson blade and razor business outside of Europe, which totaled
about $30 million in sales last year, said Gillette spokesman David
Fausch.
   Gillette also will gain a 22.9 percent non-voting interest in
the newly created Netherlands company, Swedish Match BV, which
would retain the European business of Wilkinson as well as the
worldwide match and lighter business of Swedish Match.
   Gillette is investing $155 millon in the deal, which includes
$72 million for Wilkinson's non-European business, $14 million for
the interest in Swedish Match BV, plus $69 million to help finance
the debt for the transaction.
   Gillette said a ``significant'' part of the transaction was
completed Wednesday, and the deal was expected to be completed
early next year. The total price paid by all participants for the
Swedish Match operations is about $600 million.
   While Gillette is gaining a share of the new company, ``the
primary interest is in the non-European Wilkinson blade business,''
Fausch said.
   ``Wilkinson has a very good brand name,'' he said. ``There's a
lot of potential there.''
   Gillette controls about 60 percent of the world razor market,
but Fausch said Wilkinson has a strong presence in certain
countries, such as Brazil with 8 percent and Australia with 17
percent.
   Fausch acknowledged that Wilkinson represents ``a direct head-on
competition with Trac II,'' a Gillette brand, but he said the
company foresees no complications by the acquisition.
   Wednesday's announcement came less than a week after Gillette,
based in Boston, said it was streamlining its operations and
cutting about 750 workers from its payroll. But Fausch said the
purchase of part of Wilkinson's business fits with Gillette's plans.
   ``Blades and razors are a core business for this company,'' he
said. ``This is just a reaffirmation of our core business markets.''
   The transaction is not expected to have a material effect on
Gillette earnings per share in 1989 and 1990, the company said.

<HEAD>Grocery Chain Refinances Debt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kroger Co. says it has obtained new loans and
a rotating credit line to refinance more than $2 billion in debt
from a corporate restructuring in 1988.
   New terms with lenders led by Citibank, Chemical Bank and First
National Bank of Chicago coincide with a mortgage refinancing plan
that let the supermarket chain reduce the cost of some debt, the
company said Wednesday.
   Under the new terms, Kroger finananced $2.05 billion to include
a $1.2 billion loan and an $850 million revolving line of credit
for working capital and general corporate purposes.
   The interest rate on the credit line will decline by about
three-fourths of a percent, with additional rate reductions based
on improvement in the ratio of cash flow to cash interest expenses,
Kroger said.
   ``Our lending banks recognize that in order for Kroger to remain
a strong, viable company, it must have the ability to respond to
constantly changing competitive conditions,'' Kroger Chairman Lyle
Everingham said.
   ``By fixing amortization payments at a lower level, the new
terms provide us the flexibility to maintain state-of-the-art
retail stores and to remain competitive in all our markets,''
Everingham said.
   Kroger said it expects cash interest in 1990 to be about $460
million, and total interest expenses to reach $590 million. That
compares with $510 million cash interest and $637 million in total
interest expenses previously estimated.
   Kroger borrowed $3.6 billion in October 1988 for a corporate
restructuring and a special dividend after two unsuccessful
takeover attempts against the company. Kroger said strong sales of
some assets and proceeds from refinancing have enabled it to reduce
its debt faster than expected, and to lengthen the maturities on
remaining debt.
   ``The new terms are a major step forward in reducing the cost of
Kroger's debt and giving the company more operating latitude,''
Kroger President Joseph Pichler said.
   But he said the $4.7 billion in debt remaining on the company's
books will mean the company has to maintain operating performance.

<HEAD>Coniston's UAL Ultimatum: OK Buyout by Jan. 8 or Prepare for Recap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coniston Partners investment group has
threatened to press for a recapitalization of UAL Corp. unless
United Airlines employees come up with a buyout plan for their
parent company early next month.
   But the leader of at least one airline union said Wednesday that
her group won't be rushed into anything by the ultimatum.
   In a brief statement issued after the stock market closed,
Coniston said it favored a sale of the company to one or more
employee stock ownership plans and that it has considered becoming
a long-term equity investor in such a transaction.
   But the investment group, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's
stock, also said that if no acceptable proposal was put forward by
Jan. 8, it ``intends to work with the company's board of directors
and their financial and legal advisors to develop and promptly
implement'' a recapitalization plan.
   ``A lot of time has passed since the pilots initiated their
original offer to buy the company,'' said Paul Tierney, one of
Coniston's principals. ``We don't think what's required is much
more time to understand it. What's necessary is a decision.''
   The ultimatum increases the pressure on United's pilots, UAL
management and the UAL board of directors to come up with a new
buyout plan after a pilot-management attempt to buy the company for
$6.75 billion failed two months ago.
   Coniston said it had met with representatives of UAL's board and
unions and acknowledged that progress had been made toward a new
deal.
   But, the partnership said, ``progress has been slow.''
   Patricia Friend, president of the United flight attendants, said
the union is reviewing a preliminary buyout plan proposed by UAL
management on Dec. 6.
   She said Coniston's comments Wednesday aren't likely to change
her union's strategy, which is ``to take this thing nice and
slowly, one day at a time.
   ``No one will stampede us into anything that is ill-advised or
ill-conceived,'' she said, adding that her union has no meetings
scheduled this month with UAL management.
   If Coniston and the UAL board cannot agree on a recapitalization
plan, Coniston said it might proceed with a threatened drive to
solicit shareholder consent to oust 13 of UAL's 15 directors and
create a five-member board that would include Coniston principals
Tierney, Keith Gollust and Augustus Oliver.
   A recapitalization could involve selling assets, such as planes
or routes, or borrowing money to make a payout to shareholders.
United has one of the highest percentages of company-owned planes
in the industry and could raise money by selling some of them and
leasing them back.
   UAL spokesman Joe Hopkins said he had not seen Coniston's
statement and could not comment. Kathie Hardin, a spokeswoman for
the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, also
declined to comment.
   UAL's stock lost $1.50 Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange
trading, closing at $157 a share.
   UAL had traded as high as $294 a share amid the buying frenzy
that followed the pilot-management group's $300-a-share offer in
August. British Airways PLC was to have participated as an equity
partner in that transaction.
   But the deal collapsed Oct. 13 when banks refused to finance it,
sparking a 190-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
   Since then, UAL management has been quietly seeking employee
support for a proposal that reportedly would value the company at
$240 a share, or $5.43 billion.

<HEAD>Connecticut Company to Seek Stride Rite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Connecticut investment company has
offered to buy the Stride Rite Corp. shoe manufacturer for about
$900 million.
   Stride Rite officials declined comment on the unsolicited
$32-a-share offer.
   Walsh, Greenwood &amp; Co. of Greenwich, and FS Champ Associates,
representing the Minda Bronfman de Gunzburg family trusts as a
limited partner, made the offer Wednesday, asked for nonpublic
information and for a reply by Dec. 28.
   In its offer, Walsh, Greenwood, which has owned 4.9 percent of
Stride Rite since last February, said it would consider options
after Dec. 28 and might go directly to stockholders with the same
or a modified offer.
   The offer was made as some analysts lowered their estimates of
Stride Rite earnings, partly because of the volume of shoes the
company sells to Campeau Corp., which owns department store chains
and which may file for Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Stride Rite stock
closed at $23.50, down $3.75, on heavy trading of 1.3 million
shares.
   The Walsh, Greenwood offer was disclosed just before the market
closed, and the drop in price reportedly reflected earlier news
that industry analyst Barry Rothberg of Mabon Nugent recommended
selling Stride Rite stock.
   Stride Rite reported earnings of $34.7 million, or $1.27 a
share, for the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1988.
   John J. Phelan, treasurer and chief financial officer of Stride
Rite, predicted Wednesday that the company's earnings for the 1989
fiscal year will be at the lower end of estimates, from $1.70 to
$1.80 per share, and for the 1990 fiscal year from $2 to $2.20 per
share.
   Phelan said the company has lowered its predicted growth in the
sales of Keds from 30 percent to 10 percent for the 1990 fiscal
year. Keds sales rose 40 percent during the 1989 fiscal year.
   In its purchase offer, Walsh, Greenwood said, ``We have no plans
to change the manner of the company's operation or the location of
its headquarters and principal facilities.''
   In a telephone interview, Paul R. Greenwood, managing partner of
Walsh, Greenwood, told The Boston Globe it was too early to tell
whether he would install his own management team if his company
takes over Stride Rite.
   ``We like the company a lot,'' he said. ``We just think it can
be a lot more than what it is.''

<HEAD>Judge Refuses to Dismiss Rite Aid Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge has refused to dismiss charges that the
president of Rite Aid Inc. tried to bribe an Ohio State Pharmacy
Board member.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian J. Greene on
Wednesday set a tentative trial date of Jan. 15 for Martin L.
Grass, who heads the nation's largest drug store chain.
   Grass, 35, and his attorneys appeared in court Friday to ask
Greene to drop the charges.
   Grass has denied government charges that he and Rite Aid, which
is based in Shiremanstown, Pa., were trying to put people on the
pharmacy board who were sympathetic to the company's interests.
   A secret Cuyahoga County grand jury unsealed on Aug. 1 accused
Grass and Rite Aid of offering a $33,000 bribe to pharmacy board
member Melvin Wilczynski. Prosecutors said the money was to be in
exchange for Wilczynski's stepping down from the board.
   Rite Aid has said it paid Wilczynski $33,249 for a legal buyout
of his consulting contract with Lane Drug Co., a division of
Peoples Drug Stores Inc. Rite Aid acquired Peoples Drug in April.
   The indictment charges Grass and Rite Aid with bribery and
possession of criminal tools. It alleges that Grass and the company
used an aircraft as the criminal tool last March and April.
   Both charges are felonies. The maximum penalty for the bribery
charge is a 10-year prison term and a $5,000 fine, and the charge
of possession of criminal tools is punishable by a maximum of five
years in prison and a $2,500 fine.
   Rite Aid has 29,000 employees and more than 2,200 discount drug
stores across the nation.

<TEXT>
   A reorganization plan for Yugo America Inc.,
the importer of small Yugoslavian-made automobiles, has been
approved by a federal bankruptcy judge.
   Under the plan approved Wednesday by Judge Vincent J. Commisa,
Yugo America will become a wholly owned subsidiary of the Yugoslav
automaker Zastava.
   ``The direct ownership by Zastava of Yugo America Inc. is
expected to provide the U.S. sales arm with the financial strength
and marketing commitment required to firmly establish the Yugo in
the American market,'' Yugo America President John Spiech said.
   The unsecured creditors, which are owed an estimated $24
million, will receive 9 cents on the dollar, said Robert Baine,
attorney for Impex Car Corp., a U.S. agent for Zastava.
   The Yugo dealers will be paid back the entire $7 million owed
them, Baine said. Yugo's chief bank lender, Manufacturer's Hanover
Trust in New York, will receive all $1.6 million it is owed.
   Baine said that YugoBank, one of Yugoslavia's national banks,
has committed up to $24 million in credit to the company.
   Yugo America, based in Upper Saddle River, N.J., filed for
protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy
laws on Jan. 30 along with its then-parent company Global Motors
Inc. and sister company Proton America.
   While the case was pending in bankruptcy court, Yugo continued
to sell cars.
   Yugo cars first went on sale in August 1985 for $3,995. Sales
during the first 10 months of this year were 9,193, down 78.1
percent from the same period in 1987, when sales were at their
highest rate.
   The reorganization, Spiech said, clears the way for the company
to offer a convertible and a new model line.

<HEAD>China To Amend Joint Venture Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's legislature, in a bid to restore
confidence among businesses and investors, has proposed changing a
law governing joint ventures with foreign firms.
   The proposed amendments include guarantees that the government
will not nationalize or requisition joint ventures, the official
media reported Thursday.
   The changes also stipulate that partners in a joint venture may
choose the chairman and vice chairman of their operation. Under
current law, the chairman must come from the Chinese side of the
partnership.
   The new law would not require partners to set a specific time
for the length of their contract. Previously all joint ventures
were for fixed periods, often 20 or 30 years.
   Some 8,000 joint ventures have been established since China
opened its doors 10 years ago, and foreign investors have provided
about $14 billion for business ventures.
   Chinese leaders have been trying to convince potential investors
that the investment climate remains favorable despite the political
turmoil of the pro-democracy movement and a tough government
austerity program that has stopped implementation of new economic
reforms.
   Foreign businessmen are concerned that their independence will
be limited and that the current conservative atmosphere will mean
more political interference in their operations.
   The draft amendments to the joint venture law are being
discussed at an ongoing meeting of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee. They are expected to be passed when the NPC,
China's parliament, holds its annual session next spring.

<TEXT>
   The City Council has unanimously approved
mandatory trash separation and recycling in a $160 million program
to cut in half the amount of garbage deposited in the city's
rapidly filling landfills.
   While about 1,000 U.S. cities have some kind of recycling
program, the Los Angeles effort will be among the nation's largest,
along with those in New York City and statewide in New Jersey.
   Mayor Tom Bradley said he will sign the measure approved
Wednesday.
   ``The era of the disposable society, when cans and papers can be
carelessly tossed aside, is coming to an end,'' he said. ``Through
this plan, the city now establishes a `no-excuses-accepted' policy
when it comes to recycling.''
   The plan will require all 720,000 single-family households in
the city to separate glass and plastic bottles, aluminum cans and
newspaper into different containers for collection. The city
eventually will sell reusable materials to recyclers.
   The program is to be phased in over three years, with the first
neighborhoods required to participate by next September.
   The $160 million is a three-year estimate. It has not been
determined whether the city or homeowners will pay for the hundreds
of thousands of bins and cans needed. It also has not been decided
how the program will be enforced.
   Also Wednesday, the council began considering a proposal to
force private trash haulers to recycle. Private haulers collect
garbage from businesses and larger apartment buildings, which
account for about two-thirds of all waste in the city.

   The stock market headed higher today, rebounding
from a weeklong slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.96 to 2,696.89 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 689 up, 345 down and
496 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.52 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said there was nothing that stood out in the economic
and business news to account for the upswing. But buyers appeared
to be nibbling at stocks that have lately suffered from worries
about a possible recession in 1990.
   Brokers also said traders remained hopeful that stock prices
might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One rationale for the January effect is the lifting of yearend
selling pressures from investing institutions cleaning losers out
of their portfolios and individual investing realizing losses for
tax purposes.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris rose [ to 40\;
American Express gained \ to 31{; International Business Machines

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks

value index was up .41 at 368.59.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 7.68 to

   Advancing issues nosed out declines in the overall tally on the

role in the building of an $800 million terminal at Tokyo's Haneda
Airport.
   The construction and engineering giant said Wednesday it will
participate with nine Japanese companies in building the
3.1-million-square-foot terminal, which gets under way next month.
The project is scheduled to be finished in late fiscal 1992.
   Bechtel, like other U.S. contractors, has been trying to get a
foothold in the Japanese construction market. It beame the first
American company to receive a construction license in Japan but
until now has been limited to feasibility studies for bridges,
airport terminals, geothermal plants and a golf course.
   Company officials insisted their role in the Haneda Airport
project would be more than a token one, though they did not specify
a dollar figure.
   ``Our role in this important project is a very significant one,
definitely not window dressing,'' said John L. Moore Jr., a member
of the Bechtel Group Inc.'s board of directors. ``We're going to
have to pull our weight alongside our Japanese partners.''
   Haneda Airport, near downtown Tokyo, has been used primarily for
domestic flights since the opening of Narita Airport 11 years ago.
The terminal is being built to handle Japan's fast-growing domestic
air-travel business.
   The project is headed by Taisei Corp. and includes Overseas
Bechtel Inc. as a major shareholder. Other firms in the venture are
Kajima Corp., Shimizu Corp., Takenaka Komuten Co. Ltd., Ohbayayashi
Corp., Tokyo Construction Co. Ltd., Toda Construction Co. Ltd.,
Sato Kogyo Co. Ltd., and JAL Construction Co. Ltd.

   The stock market was mixed today, levelling off
after a weeklong slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 73.16 points over
the past five sessions, was unchanged at 2,687.93 at 11 a.m. today
on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 683 up, 577 down and
514 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 55.03 million shares at
midmorning.
   Analysts said evidence of a new move Wednesday toward easier
credit by the Federal Reserve encouraged buyers to nibble warily at
stocks that have lately suffered from worries about a possible
recession in 1990.
   Brokers also said traders remained hopeful that stock prices
might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One rationale for the January effect is the lifting of yearend
selling pressures from investing institutions cleaning losers out
of their portfolios and individual investing realizing losses for
tax purposes.
   Stride Rite jumped 3 to 26{. Late Wednesday an investor group
proposed a bid for the company at $32 a share.
   Among some recently depressed stocks, Walt Disney rose 1] to
113]; Federal National Mortgage \ to 34|, and Bank of New England [
to 7~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
climbed .31 to 189.85. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up .21 at 368.39.

<HEAD>EEC Approves Merger Control Law</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 12 European Economic Community
nations on Thursday adopted a law that gives the EEC veto power
over large mergers within the trade bloc.
   Ministers of the Common Market countries granted the EEC's
administrative arm, the European Commission, authority over mergers
that currently rests with the governments of the 12 members.
   Under the new law, any proposed merger within the EEC that would
create a company with worldwide revenue of more than $5.85 billion
must be approved by the commission.
   The law also requires that the commission review a merger
creating a firm with revenue inside the EEC of more than $292.5
million.
   Transactions valued at amounts under the ceilings approved
Thursday would come under the jurisdiction of individual EEC
members.
   The law applies to mergers between two EEC companies as well as
to deals where only one company is an EEC firm.
   Before the law was passed, most large mergers were already being
submitted to the commission to ensure that proposed combinations
did not violate EEC competition rules.
   Under the law, the commission would be allowed to base its
judgment primarily on the effect a proposed merger would have on
competition within the EEC, a narrow standard pushed by Britain.
   In some cases, however, the commission will take into account
the effects of a merger on individual national markets.
   The vote ended 16 years of negotiations to bring mergers under
EEC control. The agreement was seen as a victory for the French
government, which currently holds the six-month rotating EEC
presidency and had set an agreement on the merger law as one of its
goals.

   Sears, Roebuck and Co. today announced an
employee stock ownership plan that will buy up to $800 million
worth of Sears common stock, expanding employee ownership of the
company to 21 percent from 15 percent.
   The ESOP will provide a cheaper way for the Chicago-based
retailing and financial-services company to fund its profit-sharing
program since it can deduct from its taxes dividends paid on the
ESOP shares, said Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather.
   The ESOP will buy the shares _ which would number 21.8 million
at Wednesday's closing price of $36.62{ _ over the next several
months with money loaned by the company.
   The loan will be repaid over the next 15 years from dividends on
the ESOP shares and future contributions to the profit-sharing
plan, Fairweather said.
   In a prepared statement, Sears Chairman Edward Brennan said the
``increased ownership of Sears shares reinforces our employees'
commitment to Sears' success.''

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, largely
reflecting follow-through selling from Wednesday's weaker close.
   Forecasts for more badly needed rain in Brazil, a leading
soybean producer, added to the selling pressure in the soybean
market this morning.
   In the wheat market, there were indications that the Soviet
Union is seeking to buy European, rather than U.S. wheat, which
prompted selling of wheat futures.
   Losses were limited, though by reports of new export sales of
U.S. grains. The Agriculture Department said it had accepted bids
from Iraq for 11,000 metric tons of wheat at subsidized prices and
Mexico was rumored to have bought nearly 205,000 metric tons of
U.S. corn overnight.
   The soybean market had led Wednesday's decline, which analysts
attributed to seasonal factors and to the temporary closing of the
Panama Canal. Shipments of U.S. soybeans to Japan pass through the
canal, which reopened today.
   In early trading, wheat futures were } cent to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.12 a bushel; corn was
\ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $2.38 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with March at $1.52} a bushel; soybeans
were } cent to 2 cents lower with January at $5.73 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly
higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The Agriculture Department announced this morning that its
monthly cold-storage report, which was due out this afternoon, will
be delayed until Dec. 27.
   Pork-belly futures had fallen sharply Wednesday on expectations
that the report would show a large net increase in warehoused
supplies of the commodity.
   Live cattle futures were .10 cent to .28 cent higher with
February at 76.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with January at 84.72 cents a pound; live hogs
were .07 cent lower to .23 cent higher with February at 49.07 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .55 cent lower to .23 cent higher
with February at 49.05 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures finished lower on Wednesday.

   The Transportation Department is proposing
tougher standards for door strength in minivans, small buses and
other light-weight vehicles exempt from some automobile standards.
   The proposals announced Wednesday would subject all trucks,
buses and multipurpose vehicles with a gross weight rate of 10,000
pounds or less to the same door-strength crash tests as passenger
cars.
   ``More and more of these vehicles are being used on the nation's
highways, and we believe they should have a higher level of
protection in side-impact crashes,'' said Jerry Ralph Curry, head
of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
   Car doors must be built to resist the crushing force of a steel
cylinder in laboratory tests. The new rule to be effective with
1993 model trucks would go into effect after a 60-day period for
comment.
   Curry noted that sales of light trucks, mostly minivans, have
increased during the 1980s and now total 5 million a year. This has
resulted in increased injuries and deaths to occupants of such
vehicles, he said.
   The government's move drew praise from Sen. Jack Danforth,
R-Mo., principal sponsor of a bill to require stronger side impact
protection for small trucks, minivans and four-wheel drive
vehicles. The bill cleared the Senate in August and is pending in
the House.
   ``I hope for quick department action to finalize this proposal
and to build upon it,'' Danforth said. ``Most families do not
realize that minivans and other light trucks are not as safe as
passenger cars.''

<HEAD>Reshaped Eastern Airlines Looks to Future</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a sultry night last March, Eastern Airlines
workers exploded at the stroke of midnight in a frenzy of anger
against boss Frank Lorenzo.
   The strike against Eastern had begun, like a giant kettle
venting steam built up for years. More than 2,500 red-shirted
strikers defied riot police, lobbed rocks, bottles and cinderblocks
at their employer's fenced Miami headquarters and shredded a ``scab
worker'' effigy.
   Ten months later, the Eastern drama has been played out in
federal bankruptcy court, Congress and smoke-filled union halls.
The most emotional strike in U.S. airline history has been broken
and the strikers are broke.
   It was more than a wage dispute. It was a show of force between
an owner seeking to reshape a moneylosing airline and employees
determined to block what they considered his union-busting.
   Lorenzo, who bought Eastern in early 1986, seems to have left
his mark on industrial history with a key victory. He has
vanquished the unions, hired replacements at lower wages and
restructured Eastern as a smaller carrier.
   ``It's a tragedy of all sorts of dimensions,'' said Mark Kahn,
an independent labor arbitrator in Detroit. ``He (Lorenzo) has
completely undermined the notion of loyalty on the part of
employees.''
   The pilots, who crippled the airline in March by walking out in
sympathy with the Machinists, capitulated just before Thanksgiving.
Striking flight attendants did the same. But both groups face bleak
prospects of returning to their old jobs, filled mainly by
non-union hires.
   Only the Machinists remain on lonely picket lines. Many have
scraped by with part-time work to supplement $100 a week in union
strike pay. Some have left to take jobs elsewhere.
   Still, Lorenzo's victory might prove short-lived. The strikers
may not get their jobs back but they might feel partly vindicated
if the new year brings a serious recession _ which could knock a
fragile Eastern off its feet.
   ``A recession would have a very strong impact,'' said Louis A.
Marckesano, an airline analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia.
   Many experts are expecting the economy to weaken substantially
next year, and the airline industry usually bears the brunt of a
downturn. Analysts single out Eastern, Pan Am Corp. and Trans World
Airlines Inc. as financially shaky and the most vulnerable.
   It would be difficult for Eastern to lure passengers with cheap
fares in a recession, since all the big carriers now price flights
competitively and fare cuts are usually matched by rivals.
   Marckesano said Eastern's recent projection that it will turn a
``modest'' profit in the second half of next year is an optimistic
forecast. The airline told creditors this past week it expects to
lose $250 million in the fourth quarter. That would bring Eastern's
net loss for 1989 to nearly $820 million _ a record high for the
nation's airline industry.
   Can Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp. and
the most aggressive practitioner of airline deregulation, pull off
his bold gambit?
   ``Do they (Eastern) have a chance? Sure, but it can be quite a
task,'' said Edward Starkman, who follows the industry for
PaineWebber Inc. in New York. He called the reshaped Eastern
``basically a startup airline ... an Atlanta-hubbed airline with
some Northeast-to-Florida business.''
   In recent months, Eastern has been building up Atlanta as its
hub and ``de-hubbing'' Miami, where it still maintains its
headquarters near the airport.
   Lorenzo's knockout punch came this past week, when rival
American Airlines finally agreed after months of haggling to buy
Eastern's prized Latin American routes and other assets from Texas
Air for $471 million. In one stroke, the deal made American a major
international carrier and shrank Eastern to about two-thirds of its
prestrike size.
   The deal with American capped a series of sales of Eastern jets,
routes and airport gates to several other airlines. The asset
sales, made over several months and approved by U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland, already had totaled about $688 million
before the Latin American routes were transferred.
   The proceeds, put into an escrow account, will be used to pay
Eastern's creditors.
   For the longer term, many observers believe Lorenzo's ultimate
master plan is to merge Eastern with sister carrier Continental
Airlines, the other main subsidiary of Texas Air. The gradual
disappearance of the unions from Eastern would allow a fit with
non-union Continental.
   Lorenzo's handling of Continental seemed to be a dress rehearsal
for what happened at Eastern: he restructured Continental as a
non-union carrier in 1983 after a strike and bankruptcy proceeding.
   Observers believe a merger of the two could come sometime after
Eastern emerges from Chapter 11 protection, anticipated for early
next year.
   ``I think subsequently the two airlines will merge; there'll be
no point in keeping them apart, from Texas Air's point of view,''
said Kahn. ``In effect, you've got one airline operating as two
divisions.''
   The Eastern unions have long suspected Lorenzo intended to merge
the two airlines, charging that his transfers of some Eastern
assets to Continental are part of the plan.
   The issue is so emotionally charged that even flight attendants'
uniforms have been swept up into the dispute. New navy blue outfits
for attendants at Eastern and Continental due early next year have
raised the unions' hackles, since they are almost the same for both
carriers and replace uniforms that were completely different colors.
   But then again, everything about Eastern is emotional _ and
seemingly intractable.

   The merger of the Kansas City Star and
the Kansas City Times will take place March 1, the editor of the
newspapers said Thursday.
   Joe McGuff, editor and vice president, said March 1 was a good
date because it was the start of a billing cycle. Plans to merge
the morning Times and the afternoon Star were announced Oct. 5.
McGuff said the decision came about because of sagging demand for
afternoon papers and changing lifestyles.
   The newspaper, to be called the Kansas City Star, will publish
in the morning.
   McGuff said it would be larger and better organized than the
current morning newspaper. He said it would try to appeal to
readers who wish to linger over in-depth articles and those who
prefer to scan for facts.

   The dollar finished lower against major currencies
in Europe Thursday in light pre-holiday trading. Gold prices also
fell.
   Currency strategists said there was no underlying reason for the
dollar's behavior, though some U.S.-based strategists said talk of
lower interest rates in the United States may have played a role. A
drop in interest rates would make dollar-denominated investments
worth less.
   The U.S. invasion of Panama and unrest in Romania appeared to
have had little impact on the U.S. currency, money brokers said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6125 from $1.6052 late

   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.46 yen to a closing 143.77 yen.

<TEXT>
   Here are brief profiles of some of the major
players in the Eastern Airlines strike and bankruptcy proceeding,
which began in early March:
   _FRANK LORENZO: Powerful chairman of Texas Air Corp., owner of
Eastern and Continental Airlines, denounced as a ``robber baron''
by unions and considered an airline industry pioneer by some.
   _PHIL BAKES: President of Miami-based Eastern, reporting to
Lorenzo. A former attorney for the Civil Aeronautics Board, he was
influential in drawing up the 1978 law deregulating the U.S.
airline industry.
   _CHARLES BRYAN: Leader of the Machinists union at Eastern, known
before the strike for his fiery temper and fierce opposition to
management, who adopted a low public profile after the walkout
began.
   _JACK BAVIS: Former head of Eastern pilots union, thrown out by
the membership in September for proposing that they consider ending
their strike. He was replaced by Skip Copeland, a hard-liner on the
strike.
   The pilots reversed their position shortly before Thanksgiving
and voted to call off their walkout, which had been in sympathy
with the Machinists' wage dispute. The Eastern flight attendants
union, headed by MARY JANE BARRY, quickly followed suit.
   _BURTON R. LIFLAND: The U.S. bankruptcy judge overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 proceeding that began March 9 in federal court
in New York. A powerful judge known for biting sarcasm, he took an
aggressive approach to his goal of getting Eastern flying again.
   _DAVID I. SHAPIRO: The special bankruptcy examiner appointed by
Lifland to mediate between Eastern management and unions and to
investigate the financial history of Eastern, its sister carrier
Continental and their parent Texas Air. A street-smart Washington
attorney, he has participated in cases ranging from prostitution to
freedom of speech.
   _PETER V. UEBERROTH: Former baseball commissioner, who made a
$464 million bid to buy Eastern from Lorenzo in April. He had
extensive negotiations with Eastern's unions, which agreed to labor
concessions in exchange for a 30 percent share in the airline. But
the deal collapsed when the unions insisted on a trustee to replace
Lorenzo before Ueberroth took over, and Lorenzo refused.
   _JOSEPH RITCHIE: Chicago businessman and quixotic bidder for
Eastern, who made a bid in early May in alliance with the unions.
Lifland removed the buyout plan from consideration and Lorenzo
dismissed it as a ``joke''.
   _JOEL ZWEIBEL: Lead attorney for the committee representing
Eastern's major unsecured creditors, such as aircraft manufacturers.

<HEAD>Shoemaker Says It Needs Time to Consider $900 Million Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sride Rite Corp., the leading U.S. maker
and retailer of children's footwear, said Thursday it will ignore a
Dec. 28 deadline for a response to an investment company's $900
million takeover offer.
   John J. Phelan, treasurer and executive vice president of Stride
Rite, released a letter saying his company would not make an
immediate decision on the $32 per-share offer from a group led by
Walsh, Greenwood &amp; Co. of Greenwich, Conn.
   Walsh, Greenwood had requested that Stride Rite come to a
conclusion on the matter by Dec. 28.
   ``That request is quite unreasonable as it would provide us with
only four business days to consider the matter,'' Phelan wrote in
the letter addressed to Walsh, Greenwood Managing General Partner
Stephen Walsh.
   Phelan wrote that the Stride Rite board would discuss the matter
in early January and would respond to Walsh, Greenwood at that time.
   Walsh, Greenwood and FS Champ Associates, representing the Minda
Bronfman de Gunzburg family trusts as a limited partner, made the
offer Wednesday.
   Walsh, Greenwood, which has owned 4.9 percent of Stride Rite
since last February, announced Wednesday it would consider other
options after the Dec. 28 deadline and might go directly to
stockholders with an offer.
   As the offer was made some analysts lowered their estimates of
Stride Rite earnings, partly because of the volume of shoes the
company sells to financially troubled Campeau Corp., which owns
department store chains that may seek Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
protection because of heavy debts.
   On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday morning, Stride Rite
stock was up 3], to 26~.
   The Walsh, Greenwood offer was announced just before the market
closed Wednesday.
   Stride Rite reported earnings of $34.7 million, or $1.27 a
share, for the fiscal year ended Nov. 30, 1988.
   Phelan predicted the company's earnings for the 1989 fiscal year
will be at the lower end of estimates, from $1.70 to $1.80 per
share, and for the 1990 fiscal year from $2 to $2.20 per share,
which is lower than Wall Street estimates.
   In its purchase offer, Walsh, Greenwood said, ``We have no plans
to change the manner of the company's operation or the location of
its headquarters and principal facilities.''
   Stride Rite, based in Cambridge, Mass., is the leading
children's shoemaker and retailer in the country, with more than
180 stores and more than 60 sections in department stores. It also
manufactures boating and outdoor recreational shoes and adult
workboots, and imports athletic and casual wear.

   The stock market staged a mild rally today,
pulling out of a weeklong slide.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, off 73.16 points over
the past five sessions, recovered 8.32 to 2,696.25 by 2 p.m. today

   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading

<HEAD>Loses $330.4 Million in Quarter, $1.46 Billion in Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp., one of the biggest companies to
seek bankruptcy-court protection because of a default on junk bond
debt, said Thursday lower property sales and higher interest costs
led to a $330.4 million quarterly loss.
   For the fiscal year, the real estate and financial services firm
lost $1.46 billion, due mainly a $962 million provision for losses.
   The company also said its San Jacinto Savings Association, a
thrift on which officials have based much of their recovery hopes,
was $21.2 million short of the required capital as of Sept. 30.
Southmark said it is negotiating with federal regulatory officials
over the future of San Jacinto, one of the largest thrifts in Texas.
   Southmark was one of the fastest-growing companies in Texas but
faltered badly because of an excessive reliance on debt,
particularly the use of financing with high-yield, high-risk junk
bonds.
   It went into technical default on $700 million in junk bond
obligations earlier this year and sought protection from creditors
in bankruptcy court in July.
   Southmark said the $330.4 million loss in the quarter ended June
30 amounted to $7.51 per share, compared with a $138.32 million
loss in the comparable period.
   Revenue in the quarter dropped from $539.75 million to $287.15
million.
   The fiscal year loss, which amounted to $33.16 per share,
compared with fiscal 1988's loss of $125.12 million, or $3.60 per
share.
   Revenues in the year declined form $1.86 billion to $1.79
billion.
   Southmark has said in bankruptcy filings that it had assets of
$866.5 million and debts of $1.51 billion.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed slightly higher
Thursday in a quiet session on the Chicago Board of Trade while
grain futures finished narrowly mixed.
   Support for the soybean market stemmed from a mood among traders
that after three straight days of losses, the market was oversold
and due for rebound, analysts said.
   Some buying also was linked to the Census Bureau's weekly
soybean crush report, which showed lower stocks of soybean meal and
soybean oil than the market had expected.
   The soybean market opened lower, rallied at midday, then ``laid
there like a dead fish for most of the rest of the session,'' said
Dale Gustafson, an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
Chicago.
   Trading activity was very thin in the corn, wheat and oat
markets. Sub-zero temperatures in Chicago kept some traders away
while others got an early start on the holiday weekend.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to \ cent higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.12{ a bushel; corn
futures were } cent lower to 1 cent higher with March at $2.38} a

<TEXT>
   Lee Apparel Co. will pay a $25,000 fine
and donate 1,000 pairs of new jeans to youth groups in Alabama to
settle a lawsuit that originally sought $1.3 million.
   Attorney General Don Siegelman announced the settlement at a
news conference Thursday that was attended by representatives of
several charity youth organizations that will receive the jeans.
   A lawsuit filed by Siegelman had accused the company of
violating the Alabama Deceptive Trade Practices Act by attaching
American-made labels on jeans made in Costa Rica. It also claimed
the company attempted to place labels bearing the seal of the
United Garment Workers of America in jeans made in non-union shops.
   Siegelman said the $25,000 fine would be used to boost the
$500,000 annual budget of the consumer protection activities in his
office.
   ``With this being the Christmas season, the settlement could not
have come at a better time,'' Siegelman said.
   David Brown, a Lee Apparel Co. vice president, said the company
was happy with the settlement. He said there was ``absolutely no
ill will involved'' in the change of the labels.
   ``It was a consequence of human error, an error in judgment,''
he said.

   Here are key events in the Machinists union strike against
Eastern Airlines:
   _March 3 _ President Bush refuses National Mediation Board
request to use his authority under Railway Labor Act to delay
strike 60 days. Machinists reject Eastern's latest contract offer.
Talks collapse at midnight.
   _March 4 _ Strike begins, canceling almost 90 percent of Eastern
flights, stranding passengers across nation, in Caribbean and Latin
America.
   _March 5 _ Few Eastern flights take off as pilots honor the
strike.
   _March 6 _ Eastern idles 7,000 non-union workers and cancels
nearly all flights. Airline asks federal judge to order pilots back
to work.
   _March 7 _ Judge refuses to order pilots back to work. Eastern
furloughs another 2,500 employees.
   _March 9 _ Eastern files for protection from creditors under
Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York.
   _March 31 _ Real estate tycoon Donald Trump announces he has
completed a restructured deal to buy Eastern's Northeast shuttle
service for $365 million. The new deal, revised from an October
1988 agreement, provides him with four additional Boeing 727s.
   _April 6 _ A group led by former baseball commissioner Peter V.
Ueberroth announces it will acquire Eastern and a 19.9 percent
stake in the System One reservations system in a deal valued at
$464 million. Under the deal with Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
Eastern employees would own 30 percent of the airline in return for
wage and benefit concessions.
   _April 12 _ Ueberroth and Eastern announce the buyout proposal
has collapsed. Eastern says it intends to reorganize as a smaller
carrier serving roughly 50 percent to 60 percent of its pre-strike
schedule.
   _May 3 _ A group led by William Howard, former chairman of
Piedmont Aviation, discloses that it is interested in making a
buyout proposal for all of Eastern. Chicago businessman Joseph
Ritchie already has expressed interest.
   America West Airlines offers to pay $726 million for Eastern's
shuttle and 10 Boeing 757s.
   _May 23 _ Eastern graduates its first class of new pilots hired
since the start of the strike.
   _May 25 _ Lifland formally approves the sale of the shuttle to
Trump for $365 million, after America West withdraws offer because
of failure to arrange financing.
   _June 1 _ David Shapiro, bankruptcy examiner in the Eastern
case, dismisses the Howard group's offer.
   _June 2 _ Eastern announces an austerity program for non-union
employees.
   _June 5 _ Lifland removes the Ritchie plan from consideration.
   _July 21 _ Eastern submits a reorganization plan to the
bankruptcy court. Creditors express approval.
   _Early August _ The striking pilots vote to continue their
sympathy walkout.
   _Aug. 24 _ Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo says he is
considering selling all or part of Continental Airlines, Eastern's
sister carrier. Scandinavian Airlines Systems, which owns 9.9
percent of Texas Air, reportedly is interested in buying a stake in
Continental.
   _Aug. 31 _ Eastern abandons an earlier plan to sell Latin
American routes, giving it around $370 million less in cash by
yearend than first projected.
   _Sept. 8 _ The striking pilots vote to throw out their leader,
Jack Bavis, for proposing that they consider ending walkout.
   _Sept. 13 _ Lorenzo tells Texas Air shareholders Eastern will
turn a profit in 1990. SAS says it has no ``immediate interest'' in
buying part of Continental.
   _Nov. 22 _ The 2,250 pilots still on strike vote to end it. The
striking flight attendants quickly follow, leaving the Machinists
alone on picket lines. Eastern says few jobs are left because it's
hired replacements.
   _Dec. 19 _ American Airlines announces it will buy Latin
American routes and other assets from Texas Air for $471 million.
The deal shrinks Eastern to about two-thirds its pre-strike size.

   Assets of the nation's 469 money market mutual
funds rose $208.2 million in the latest week, the Investment
Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise to $367.11 billion in the seven-day period ended
Wednesday, followed a revised decline of $243.9 million the
previous week to a revised total of $366.90 billion, the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.
   The decline originally was reported as $336.3 million to a total
of $366.81 billion.
   The funds' assets hit a record high $368.23 billion in the week
ended Nov. 21, 1989.
   The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest week,
assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $831.1 million to $120.51
billion, assets of 98 broker-dealer funds dropped $244.4 million to
$158.78 billion, and assets of 144 institutional funds dropped
$378.5 million to $87.82 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.91 percent from 7.90 percent the
previous week, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade
journal based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.92 percent from 7.95 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
42 days, down from 43 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts rose to 6.36 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.35 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, was unchanged from last week at 5.08 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.95
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.98 the
previous week. Yields were 7.98 percent on 1-year CDs, down from
8.00 percent; 7.94 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.96 percent;
and 7.95 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 7.96 percent.

<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. was accused in a
lawsuit filed Thursday by New York's attorney general that the
retailer's ``everyday low prices'' policy is a fraud. Sears denied
the charges.
   Under the pricing policy announced in March, Sears said it would
cut back drastically on the number of sales it conducts but would
offer many items at lower prices every day.
   But Attorney General Robert Abrams said Thursday that a shopping
survey by his office in many of Sears' 42 New York stores indicated
that isn't the case.
   ``In fact, when consumers went to make purchases, they were
paying essentially the same price'' as under the old system, he
said. ``And in a number of instances, they were actually paying a
higher price.''
   Abrams said he believes the problem may not be limited to Sears'
operations in New York.
   ``We believe that this is a nationwide practice that is being
conducted by Sears in all their stores throughout the United
States,'' said Abrams. ``I'm alerting my colleagues _ the attorneys
general of the other states _ of this investigation so that Sears
might be facing similar action by others.''
   Michael Bozic, chairman and chief executive of Sears
Merchandising Group, denied the company was misleading the public.
   ``We are shocked by the distorted and untrue statements the New
York state attorney general made to news media today regarding
Sears everyday low pricing,'' Bozic said in a news release.
   ``We have a valuable reputation for trust and integrity with
American consumers and we intend to prove these malicious charges
are false,'' he said.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer, has 847 stores in the
United States.
   In the lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Buffalo, Abrams
alleged that Sears portrayed the ``everyday low price'' policy as a
perpetual sale, creating the false impression that the new prices
represented cut-rate discounts from Sears' previous prices.
   For instance, he said, a canister vacuum which sold most
frequently at a sale price of $199.99 under the old system was
listed at an ``everyday low price'' of $219.99.
   Similarly, a living room set which most often sold at $899.94
before March cost $979 under the ``everyday low price'' system.
   Abrams said his office received information on Sears' prices and
number of units sold by monitoring advertisements and obtaining
actual sales figures from the company.
   ``(Sears advertised) that in effect every day, virtually every
item would be on sale,'' he said. ``We have found that they have
deceived consumers; that the prices that people pay are not
substantial sale bonus discounted prices.''
   About 20 items were priced, Abrams said. Bozic said that's too
small a number to accurately reflect all of the items Sears sells.
   ``While we have not yet reviewed his lawsuit, we believe that it
is based on an investigation of only 14 items out of the more than
100,000 items we sell,'' he said. ``This, in itself, is
misleading.''
   Thursday's action marks the second time in three years Abrams'
office has had problems with Sears' marketing.
   In 1986, Abrams' office and Sears reached a settlement where the
company paid a $75,000 fine to settle a complaint that it engaged
in false advertising.
   In that case, the state accused Sears of claiming that items
were discounted from regular prices when, in fact, the items almost
never sold for the ``regular price.''
   ``We caught them doing that, they were fined $75,000 and they
pledged never to do it again,'' said Abrams. ``We have shopped in
the store on a weekly basis over an 18-month period and we caught
them doing the same thing again.''
   The suit filed Thursday also charged that Sears violated its
1986 agreement.
   The state asked the court to fine Sears, stop it from engaging
in such practices in the future and order restitution for consumers
``who were induced to buy items because of the fraudulent
advertising and sales practices.''

<HEAD>Energy Futures Surge as Cold Weather Continues</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Heating Oil</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continued cold weather in the eastern half of
the nation boosted energy futures sharply higher Thursday.
   Home heating oil for January delivery shot up 4.05 cents to
79.81 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Subsequent contract months also posted strong gains.
   Demand for heating oil has surged as temperatures plunged in
recent days. Several oil companies _ including Exxon USA, Mobil
Corp. and Texaco Inc.'s Star Enterprise _ have reported temporary
shortages of the fuel at some of their Northeast terminals.
   James Fiedler, an oil market analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said the cold was responsible not only
for the jump in heating oil prices, but in gasoline futures as well.
   Unleaded gasoline for January delivery rose 2.41 cents to 55.63
cents a gallon on the mercantile exchange, with later months also
rising sharply.
   Fiedler said traders were anticipating weather-related problems
at gasoline refineries in Texas, where freezing temperatures have
forced plant shutdowns in previous years. Refinery closings could
make gasoline supplies tighter.
   Crude oil prices, which often rise along with refined product
prices, continued that trend Thursday. West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, rose 31 cents to settle at $21.52 a
42-gallon barrel.

   The dollar declined modestly against most major
currencies Thursday in quiet trading, tipped lower by renewed
anticipation of lower interest rates.
   Gold prices also slipped, despite the continuing fighting in
Panama and political turmoil in Romania. Republic National Bank in
New York quoted a bid for a troy ounce of gold at $412.20 as of 4
p.m. EST, down from $413.05 late Wednesday.
   Dealers said currency traders also shrugged off the U.S.
military intervention in Panama, which was in its second day.
   ``The market viewed it as a very short-lived situation,'' said
Stephen Flanagan, a vice president of foreign exchange at
Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. ``Interest rates seem to be
dominating the market right now.''
   On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve appeared to signal an easing
of its monetary policy when the central bank added reserves to the
banking system. The action helped lower the federal funds rate, a
key barometer of interest rates.
   A drop in interest rates cuts yields on dollar-denominated
investments.
   Economists have expected the central bank to ease monetary
policy to stimulate the sagging economy.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar fell 0.46 Japanese yen to a closing 143.77 yen. Later,
in London, it was quoted at 143.68 yen. By the end of trading in
New York, the dollar had slipped to 143.65 yen, down from 143.93
yen late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6125 from $1.6052 late
Wednesday. Later, in New York, a pound cost $1.6145, more expensive
than $1.6060 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.7260 West German marks, down from
1.7320; 5.8900 French francs, down from 5.9125; 1.5580 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5555; 1,285.50 Italian lire, down from 1,288.50;

   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday,
included: 1.7250 West German marks, down from 1.7355; 1.5575 Swiss

   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
closed at $411.90 a troy ounce, down from $413.60 late Wednesday.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $412.75 a troy ounce
from $413.50 late Wednesday. In Zurich, Switzerland, the metal was

   The stock market struggled to a small gain
Thursday, halting a week-long slide.
   Analysts said traders drew some mild encouragement from signs
that the Federal Reserve was continuing little by little to relax
its credit policy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 73.16 points in
the five preceding sessions, gained 3.20 to 2,691.13.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
932 up, 627 down and 460 unchanged.
   With five trading days left in 1989, the Dow Jones industrial
average shows a net gain of 522.56 points, or 24.1 percent, since
the start of the year.
   Analysts said evidence of a new move Wednesday toward easier
credit by the Federal Reserve encouraged buyers to nibble warily at
stocks that have lately suffered from worries about a possible
recession in 1990.
   Brokers also said traders remained hopeful that stock prices
might benefit from the so-called January effect, a historical
tendency for the market _ and especially smaller stocks _ to show
greater-than-usual strength in the first few weeks of a new year.
   One explanation often offered for the January effect is the
lifting of yearend selling pressures from investing institutions
cleaning losers out of their portfolios and individual investors
realizing losses for tax purposes.
   Stride Rite jumped 3] to 27~. Late Wednesday an investor group
proposed a bid for the company at $32 a share.
   Among recently depressed stocks, Walt Disney rose 2\ to 114\;
Federal National Mortgage [ to 34{; General Motors ~ to 42], and
International Business Machines { to 95[.
   Boston Edison dropped 1{ to 20[. The company cut its quarterly
dividend from 45.5 cents to 38 cents a share.
   Caterpillar, which projected a decline in fourth-quarter
earnings from the previous three months, fell 1~ to 57|.
   Magnetek lost 1 to 8| in one of the day's biggest percentage
declines. The company said a jury ruled against its Universal
Manufacturing subsidiary in a breach-of-contract case involving
L.M.P. Corp.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 175.15 million
shares, against 176.52 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 212.70 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $18.18 billion, or
0.55 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .96 to 190.50.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.95 to 393.81, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.94 at 344.78.

<HEAD>Frigid Weather Again Boosts Orange Juice, Heating Oil Futures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Frigid weather forecasts continued to boost orange juice and
heating oil futures prices Thursday as a record-shattering Canadian
cold front moved southward and eastward.
   On other commodity markets, precious metals turned lower;
livestock and meat futures advanced; and grains and soybeans were
mixed.
   Prices of most contracts for future deliveries of frozen
concentrated orange juice soared the permitted daily limit of 5
cents a pound on the New York Cotton Exchange. The limitless
contract for January delivery rose 7.25 cents to $1.417 a pound.
   Weather Services Corp., a private forecasting firm in Bedford,
Mass., rated the probability of a weekend freeze in the Florida
citrus belt at 80 percent Thursday, up from 75 percent on Wednesday
and 50 percent the day before.
   Peter Leavitt, executive vice president of Weather Services,
said the coldest temperatures _ projected at 18 to 28 degrees _
would likely occur Sunday morning in the citrus country.
   The expected freeze would rival one that occurred on Christmas
Day in 1983, severely damaging the Florida orange crop, and could
well be colder, Leavitt said.
   ``You cannot really underestimate the magnitude of this cold air
mass for this time of year,'' Leavitt said. ``This will go into the
books, I'm sure, as an historic event.''
   The enter of the cold front plowed out of the Northern Plains
and into the Midwest on Thursday, dropping temperatures as low as
22 below zero in Sioux City, Iowa, and pushing mercury below the
freezing mark nearly as far south as the Gulf of Mexico.
   In the populous Northeast, the area most closely watched by
heating oil traders at this time of year, the encroaching cold
front promised no relief from the sub-normal temperatures that are
likely to make this December the coldest on record.
   ``Temperatures in the Northeast have averaged below normal every
single day this month,'' Leavitt said. ``This is the 23rd straight
day of below-normal temperatures.''
   The cold has forced fuel oil dealers to delve into their
reserves to meet the extraordinary demand and, on Thursday, drove
heating oil futures prices up sharply on the New York Mercantile
Exchange for the fifth straight day and the 16th time in the last
17 trading sessions.
   The buying spilled over into the crude oil and gasoline pits,
powering futures prices for those commodities up as well.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 31 cents to 36 cents
higher with February at $21.52 a barrel; heating oil was .90 cent
to 4.05 cents higher with January at 79.81 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was 1.55 cent to 2.41 cents higher with January at 55.63
cents a gallon.
   Precious-metals futures prices sagged in quiet trading on New
York's Commodity Exchange as players squared their books ahead of
the long holiday weekend.
   Gold futures finished $1.70 to $2.30 lower with December at
$411.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 1 cent lower with
December at $5.543 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange after a late rally linked to technical factors
and to the cold weather in the Midwest, which has cut deeply into
hog marketings.
   Live cattle futures finished .35 cent to .50 cent higher with
February at 76.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .40
cent higher with January at 84.80 cents a pound; live hogs were .05
cent to .33 cent higher with February at 49.47 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .38 cent higher with February
at 49.60 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices settled slightly higher in a quiet
session on the Chicago Board of Trade while grain futures finished
narrowly mixed.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March
at $4.12} a bushel; corn futures were } cent lower to 1 cent higher

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three broadest measures of the nation's
money supply rose in the week ended Dec. 11, the Federal Reserve
Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $793.1 billion from $789.7 billion the
previous week.
   The measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,212.2
billion from $3,207.4 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,059.3 billion from $4,056.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.4 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.0 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,184.3 billion, a 7.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,034.0 billion, up 3.3 percent, while M1
rose 6.1 percent to an average of $787.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $169 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$110 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $294.5 billion in the two-week period ended
Dec. 13, up from $293.4 billion two weeks earlier.

   Chemical products giant ICI PLC
announced Thursday it has agreed to buy Tyler Corp.'s Atlas Powder
Co. to strengthen its position in commercial explosives and
detonator products businesses.
   The agreement is valued at $193 million with ICI assuming $58
million in debts and paying $135 million to Tyler shareholders. The
deal is expected to be completed in early 1990.
   Atlas is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Dallas-based Tyler.
ICI is based in London. Its American operation is ICI Americas,
headquartered in Wilmington.
   ``The United States is the world's largest commercial explosives
market and this acquisition will significantly enhance the
geographical coverage of ICI's international explosives business
and provide additional product opportunities arising from the
introduction of ICI technology into the U.S. marketplace,'' said
Bob Clark, a top executive of ICI explosives.
   ICI's explosives business has been based in Toronto since 1988.
Last year, the business had sales of $655 million. The business
employs about 8,000 people worldwide.
   Atlas, founded in 1912, manufactures and sells commercial
explosives and detonator products almost exclusively in the United
States. Atlas operates in 35 states and employs about 1,500 people.
It had sales of $198 million in 1988.

   Allegheny International Inc. reported Thursday
that its net loss nearly tripled in its fiscal fourth quarter from
a year earlier.
   The small-appliance maker said it posted a net loss of $36.7
million, or $4.06 a share, in the three months ended Oct. 1,
widened from a loss of $12.4 million, or $1.84 a share, a year

   Fourth-quarter revenue fell to $207.4 million from $222.9

   Allegheny International has operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection for around two years. Earlier this month, a federal
judge approved a $6.25 million settlement of shareholders' lawsuits
from 1986 that accused some officers and directors of violating
securities laws.
   Minneapolis financier Irwin L. Jacobs, once the largest
shareholder in the company, recently sold all of his remaining
shares.
   The company said the latest fourth-quarter results included
charges of $21.1 million for plant rationalization, business
restructuring and product writeoff costs. The same period a year
earlier included $9.3 million in charges.
   For the fiscal year ended Oct. 1, Allegheny International posted
a net loss of $54.9 million, or $7.80 a share, compared with a loss
of $25.1 million, or $5.10 a share, a year earlier.
   Full-year revenue declined to $937.6 million from $967.8 million.

   Consumer prices in the 12 European
Community nations rose by an average of 0.4 percent in November,
slowing from a 0.6 percent increase in October, the economic bloc
said Thursday.
   Its statistical bureau said EC inflation would be about 5.5

1987.
   The highest price increases in November were in Portugal, with 1
percent, and in Britain and Greece, with 0.9 percent each.
   Prices were unchanged in the Netherlands, while the consumer
price index fell 0.1 percent in Belgium.
   The EC said rates of inflation for the 12 European countries so

<TEXT>
   Consumer spending rebounded 0.7 percent in
November from its sharp fall a month earlier, the government
reported Thursday, and analysts said it continues to be one of the
bright spots in a slowing economy.
   ``It suggests that while we have some weak areas in the economy,
particularly in the manufacturing sector, that the consumer has not
turned off completely,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey
G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York.
   The Commerce Department also reported an 0.8 percent increase in
personal incomes in November, but some analysts questioned whether
income growth will soon begin to weaken and thus cause a decline in
spending.
   The report said consumer spending rose at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate to $3.54 trillion, a 0.7 percent increase and the
steepest gain since a 1 percent jump last April.
   The advance was a rebound from a 0.2 percent decline in October,
which was the first decrease since a 0.1 percent dip in September
1988 and the largest drop since a 1.4 percent fall in January 1987.
   Consumer spending, which has been a major factor for the
economic growth during the first nine months of the year, is
watched closely as a barometer of economic health because it
accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Commerce reported last week that retail sales rose 0.8 percent
in November, a rebound from a 1.3 percent decrease in October.
Analysts said it reflected the start of the Christmas buying season
the weekend after Thanksgiving.
   As measured by the gross national product, the economy grew at a
3 percent rate in the third quarter after gains of 3.7 percent in
the first and 2.5 percent in the second, but analysts expect a
sharp decline in the three-month period ending Dec. 31.
   Jones said prospects are good for continued consumer spending,
``particularly in non-durables such as apparel, and in the services
area ... because consumers are still basically optimistic and have
income growth to support that optimism.''
   Personal incomes in November totaled $4.54 trillion at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate, following a similar 0.8 percent
gain to $4.50 trillion in October. It was the largest increase
since a 1 percent gain last March.
   But Lawrence Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA
Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting group, said there were a
number of factors that could lead to decreased spending.
   ``The negatives are the high debt loads,'' he said. ``People now
are getting more concerned about the future. You're seeing more
layoffs and, particularly for durables, the pent-up demand we had
in the earlier '80s has just been used up. People just don't have
the same needs.''
   The $26.2 billion increase in personal consumption, which
includes everything except interest payments on debt, contrasted to
a $6.3 billion decrease in October.
   Purchases of durable goods _ big-ticket items expected to last
more than three years _ rose $1.9 billion, while purchases of
non-durable goods jumped $12.4 billion. Spending on services
increased $11.9 billion.
   The November report showed that Americans' incomes after taxes
rose 0.9 percent, up from October's 0.8 percent gain.
   Americans' savings rate _ savings as a percent of disposable
income _ rose to 6.1 percent, up from October's 5.7 percent rate.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
edged up $1.7 billion in November following a $29.4 billion gain in
October.
   Payrolls at manufacturing companies, hit hardest by the Federal
Reserve's high-interest polices, fell $4.9 billion, after an
October advance of $6.3 billion.

<HEAD>SEC Accuses 2 Connecticut Men of Insider Trading Scheme</HEAD>

   Two Connecticut men were accused in a civil
complaint Thursday of an insider trading scheme involving Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi's tender offer for Gartner Group Inc., said federal
regulators.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said it filed a civil
complaint at federal court in Connecticut against Robert Charles
Troup and Helmut August Alpers, both of New Canaan, Conn.
   Troup was accused of making $78,812 in illegal trading profits
with insider information about Gartner Group allegedly supplied by
Alpers, an executive vice president with the Stamford, Conn.,
market research and data processing company.
   Alpers, who was not accused of sharing in the alleged ill gotten
gains, agreed to settle the charges without admitting or denying
wrongdoing, the SEC said.
   Alpers consented to an injunction that bars him from violating
federal securities laws and agreeed to pay $78,812 in penalties
under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act, which requires insiders
who share confidential information top pay a sum equal to alleged
illegal profits even if they did not share in them.
   Troup has not settled the charges, according to the SEC.
   Troup's lawyer in Stamford and Alpers' attorney in Washington
were not in their offices when called for comment Thursday evening.
The SEC complaint did not disclose what Troup did for a living or
how the two men knew each other.
   According to the SEC, Alpers allegedly obtained inside
information in May 1988 that Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, the British
advertising agency, intended to acquire Gartner Group and tipped
Troup to the upcoming deal a month later.
   The SEC complaint alleged that on the morning of June 13, 1988,
Troup bought 22,000 shares of Gartner Group common stock, paid for
in part with an $82,500 loan from Alpers. Later that day Gartner
Group publicly disclosed that it was engaged in sales discussions
with an unidentified company.
   According to the complaint, Troup sold 14,000 Gartner shares on
June 13 and the rest on June 17, after Saatchi &amp; Saatchi publicly
announced its tender offer for Gartner.

<HEAD>Carrier Reports Quarterly Loss of $134.9 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc., which filed for bankruptcy
protection this fall, announced Thursday a net loss for the quarter
ended Oct. 31 of $134.9 million, compared with a $7.8 million loss
in the year-earlier period.
   The net loss per share for the quarter was $9.15, compared with
a loss of 59 cents per share in the quarter ended Oct. 31, 1988.
   Operating revenues for the airline for the quarter totaled $98.9
million, down from $127.5 million for the same quarter in 1988.
   Braniff's consolidated operating loss for the quarter was $40.4
million, compared with a loss of $10.9 million in the quarter a
year ago.
   Orlando-based Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from creditors on Sept. 28 and substantially reduced its scheduled
passenger service.
   On Nov. 6, Braniff suspended all scheduled flights. It remains a
charter carrier.

<HEAD>Troubled Airline Agrees to Return Jetliners Leased From Irish Company</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Braniff Inc. and the Irish aviation company
GPA Group PLC announced an agreement Thursday for the return to GPA
of five jetliners leased earlier this year to the Orlando-based
airline.
   The announcement came 10 days after GPA filed lawsuits against
the carrier in Orlando and in Kansas City, Mo., seeking the return
of five Airbus Industrie A320 planes. GPA had accused the airline
of failing to pay $3 million owed for the jets by a Nov. 27
deadline.
   ``We are returning the A320's as a show of good faith that we
wish to work together with GPA as we continue to reorganize our
finances under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code,''
Braniff spokeswoman Ann Cook said in a statement.
   GPA's lawsuits against Braniff, Cook said, ``will be dismissed,
and GPA will also drop its claim for attorneys' fees and cost
claims'' over the lawsuits.
   In December 1988, GPA agreed to lease Braniff a total of 26 of
the 150-seat Airbus A320's. Under terms of that agreement, Braniff
also purchased 24 more of the aircraft from Airbus Industrie, a
European consortium.
   The airline also holds options to buy an additional 50 of the
jetliners.
   ``Braniff is actively attempting to market these rights to
maximize the value of the A320's,'' said Cook, who also said
Thursday's accord over the return to GPA of the five planes did not
affect the two companies' rights over the other 21 airliners.
   On Sept. 28, Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
and sharply reduced its scheduled passenger service. The airline
suspended all scheduled service Nov. 6 but remains a charter
carrier.
   Braniff also announced Thursday a net loss for the quarter ended
Oct. 31 of $134.9 million, compared with a loss of $7.8 million for
the same quarter in 1988.

<HEAD>Three Members of Campbell Soup Family Say They Don't Want To Sell</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three children of former Campbell Soup Co.
Chairman John T. Dorrance Jr. vowed to keep the food industry giant
independent in papers filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Thursday.
   John T. Dorrance III, Bennett Dorrance and Mary Alice Dorrance
Malone, who together own about 31 percent of the company's
outstanding stock, filed separate statements with the SEC seeking
to sever their holdings from a voting trust dissolved last Friday,
said Scott Rombach, a company spokesman.
   The three siblings and three of their cousins _ all decendants
of John T. Dorrance Sr., the inventor of condensed soup and company
founder _ control 57.8 percent of Campbell stock.
   Their holdings had been pooled in a majority shareholders trust
that was formed in 1987 in anticipation of the death the founder's
son, John Jr. Despite the effort, when Dorrance died last April,
analysts speculated the company might be put up for sale.
   Since the trust was dissolved Friday all six Dorrance decendants
have filed papers to regain independent control of their holdings.
   Thursday's filings by the three siblings _ who control 10.5
percent of the stock each _ ``underscored their commitment to
seeking to influence the board of directors in the direction of
keeping Campbell an independent company,'' Rombach said.
   In other company news, two members of the Dorrance family were
elected Thursday to Campbell's board of directors.
   The elections, effective Jan. 1, increase the total number of
directors from 13 to 15. Six are Dorrance family members.
   The two new directors are Ms. Malone and Charlotte D. Colket
Weber.
   Ms. Malone breeds horses in Chester, Pa.
   Ms. Weber, of Ocala, Fla., is an investor, philanthropist and
art collector. She was recently named one of New York City's
richest women.
   Campbell's board had been unhappy with the company's performance
in recent years, but corporate brass have downplayed the
significance of major changes at the company in recent months.
   In November, R. Gordon McGovern stepped down as Campbell's chief
executive officer and president. A two-man interim management team
was appointed to oversee day-to-day operations, but a replacement
has not been named.
   In August, the company announced a sweeping restructuring that
includes the closing of manufacturing plants in Camden, Maryland
and Tennessee with a loss of 2,800 jobs.

<HEAD>Boeing Chairman Confirms Layoffs Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. plans layoffs in the first half of
1990, particularly among production workers at Everett, Chairman
Frank Shrontz said Thursday.
   Shrontz's comment in a Seattle Times interview confirmed recent
speculation that jobs would be cut at the giant aerospace company.
   Shrontz said it was too early to specify how many workers would
be laid off but ``it is pretty clear we will bring down employment
in the Puget Sound area in the first half of next year.'' He
characterized the layoffs as ``modest.''
   In the early 1970s as many as 60,000 workers lost their jobs in
a two-year period.
   Boeing employs about 107,000 people in Washington state and
165,000 worldwide.
   Shrontz said the company had anticipated a reduction in
production workers who were needed for startup work on the 747-400
jetliner, but originally had not thought layoffs would be necessary.
   But increased experience and productivity on the assembly lines
is lessening the need for all the workers, Shrontz said, even
though the company is experiencing a record surge in orders _ 888
jets worth $46.7 billion this year. There is also an $85 billion
backlog of more than 1,700 planes.
   Shrontz said he had hoped excess workers could be transferred to
work on the B-2 Stealth bomber, but B2 work was slowed as part of
defense-budget cutbacks, leaving the extra commercial jet workers
nowhere to go.
   Boeing, a subcontractor to the Northrop Corp. on the new bomber,
has had nearly 10,000 people working on the B2.
   Shrontz said some engineers in Wichita, Kan., also may lose
their jobs.
   A 48-day Machinists union' strike that ended last month
``clearly hurt our profitability,'' Shrontz said, but he declined
to be specific.
   Boeing had been expected to deliver 94 jets during the fourth
quarter but now may deliver less than half that number.
   ``We hope to get (the factories) back up to speed in the first
quarter,'' he said.
   On another topic, he said Boeing ``clearly has been hurt in
image'' by a flurry of federal investigations and charges filed
this year.
   ``The defense business is very difficult,'' he said. ``There is
still a significant resentment against defense contractors by the
public and I foresee this climate will continue.''
   Richard Fowler, a former Boeing Aerospace employee, was recently
convicted of 39 counts of document trafficking and fraud in federal
court in Alexandria, Va. Boeing agreed to pay a $5.2 million fine
and pleaded guilty to two counts of illegally receiving secret
government documents in the case.
   ``What's so frustrating about this is that it occurred in the
early 1980s,'' said Shrontz. ``I think we've gained substantially
in ethics since then.''
   He said the company has found no further evidence of fraud or
misconduct in federal investigations of project billings. The
government continues to investigate the overbilling allegations.
   On other topics, Shrontz said that while Boeing is reorganizing
its defense business divisions, the company will stay in defense
work.
   ``We'll find our niche,'' he said.
   It likely will be a few months before Boeing knows if its
proposed 777 wide-body twinjet is viable, he said. Possible
participation in the 777 by Japanese manufacturers is up in the
air, as are firm orders from airlines.
