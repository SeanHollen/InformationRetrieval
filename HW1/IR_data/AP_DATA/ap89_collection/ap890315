   Guerrillas fired
rocket-propelled grenades at the presidential palace and an adjacent
military garrison Wednesday, wounding a palace guard and six
civilians in the neighborhood, officials said.
   Leftist rebels also attacked a provincial capital and vowed to
kill election workers and mayors, trying to disrupt Sunday's
presidential election and stepping up the pace of the civil war.
   The rebels also vowed to destroy vehicles defying its traffic ban
scheduled to begin midnight Wednesday.
   Col. Ricardo Casanova, commander of El Zapote garrison next to
the palace, said several of the grenades landed in the neighborhood
near the palace, which houses President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
office. Duarte was not at the scene.
   Witnesses said a grenade apparently hit one of the patios of the
block-wide presidential palace. Casanova said the rebels also
launched homemade bombs with catapults.
   Earlier Wednesday, authorities said two bombs exploded outside
the garrison, slightly injuring a woman passer-by but causing no
damage.
   Shortly after the attack, Radio Venceremos, the radio station of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, said the attack was
launched by its ``urban commandos.''
   Casanova said some of the shrapnel was found inside the walls of
the palace. Six civilians were injured by other grenades that fell
in the adjoining neighborhood.
   Casanova said the grenades also toppled two electricity poles.
   Also Wednesday, gunmen killed Francisco Peccorini, 60, a
well-known conservative politicial theoretician, as he traveled in a
car with his bodyguards through the capital's downtown commercial
section. The killers fled, their identity and motives unknown.
   The front, the umbrella guerrilla organization, made clear it was
trying to intensify El Salvador's nervousness about the upcoming
nationwide election.
   It issued an implicit death threat against election workers,
reiterated that it will enforce its call for an election boycott
with the transit ban and stepped up attacks on military and civilian
targets.
   The military is preparing to provide armed escorts to vehicles
carrying voters to the polls.
   The election presents this small Central American nation, which
has a long history of coups and military rule, with its first chance
to vote out an elected civilian government.
   But Duarte has said he fears people will be afraid to vote.
   The widely acknowledged front-runner in the presidential race is
Alfredo Cristiani, nominee of the rightist Republican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena.
   Duarte's Christian Democrats are fielding Fidel Chavez Mena,
ranked in the polls as the No. 2 contender.
   A leftist alliance, the Democratic Convergence, is the third
major force. Its candidate, Guillermo Ungo, returned from exile to
represent the left in its the elections.
   Salvadorans approached election day with uncertainty, unsure if a
clear winner would emerge and braced for an outbreak of fighting the
rebels have promised.
   More than half the people questioned in a poll released Wednesday
by the respected Central American University either refused to say
for whom they would vote, said they hadn't decided or said they
weren't voting.
   Most of the 70,000 people who have died in the nine-year civil
war were civilians.
   Most civilian deaths are attributed to security forces and
right-wing death squads, but the leftist insurgents also have
extracted their toll.
   ``We are aware that there is going to be an increase in the
violence nationwide,'' Col. Rene Emilio Ponce, armed forces chief of
staff, said as he inspected the aftermath of a fierce battle in
Chalatenango on Wednesday.
   He said a rebel force of about 200 attacked the provincial
capital about 45 miles north of San Salvador.
   The military said 18 rebels died in eight hours of fighting that
raged into the pre-dawn hours. Two soldiers were killed and four
injured.
   Rebel radio said the military suffered 13 casualties, without
giving a breakdown of dead and wounded.
   Ponce said three guerrillas also were killed in an attack on a
government warehouse near Chalatenango.
   The guerrillas' campaign has left half of El Salvador's cities
and town without mayors. Rebels killed nine mayors and 135 resigned.
   The rebels told election workers, as they had told the mayors, to
resign or become targets.
   ``We remind you that the FMLN is everywhere,'' the rebels said
Wednesday on clandestine Radio Venceremos.
   The rebels crippled vital services with attacks on telephone and
electrical installation and on Tuesday bombed filling stations.
   Tens of thousands of leftists, suspected leftists and other
presumed government opponents have been killed in El Salvador during
this decade. The United States and international organizations have
described the killings as massive human rights abuses by the
military and far-right death squads.
   Most observers say the big question is whether there will be a
runoff between Arena and the Christian Democrats. Anything over 50
percent is a first-round victory.

<HEAD>Israelis In Egypt Keep Low Profile 10 Years After Peace Pact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NUBARIYA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite 10 years of peace, Israelis living
in Egypt still face resentment and are forced to keep a low profile
for reasons of politics and security.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, on a rare trip to Egypt by a senior
Israeli official, tried to raise Israeli visibility recently by
visiting this state-owned farm where Israeli experts are involved in
an irrigation project.
   ``This project is a big success,'' Arens said, ``and being a big
success it will become well known.''
   The project was started in 1986 but was kept quiet until the
foreign minister came with a busload of journalists.
   Egypt's agriculture minister, Yussef Wali, noted that while the
project had not been publicized in Egyptian media it is highly
visible to Egyptians because it is about 60 miles north of Cairo on
a main highway to Alexandria on the Mediterranean.
   ``It is seen by thousands of people, and this is real publicity
for the project,'' Wali said.
   The farm, however, has no sign to show that Israeli experts are
there watching over such crops as chilis, sweet peppers, tomatoes
and cucumbers.
   A large green-and-white billboard, however, announces Saudi
Arabian cooperation in other aspects of the farm.
   Mark Zuk, 38, one of a half-dozen Israeli agriculture advisers
here, said he had no specific instructions to hide his presence. But
he added that political events sometimes made the atmosphere tense
and he avoids sensitive topics. One such topic is the 15-month
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip, where Israeli soldiers have killed more than 390 Arabs.
   ``We never talk about political subjects,'' Zuk said. ``They
don't bring it up and neither do I. I feel comfortable with the
people I am working with and don't feel any rejection.''
   Thousands of Israeli tourists have visited Egypt since Israel
signed the peace treaty March 26, 1979, that ended three decades of
war. About 100 Israeli Embassy staff members and their families now
live in Cairo, but only about a dozen non-official Israelis work in
Egypt on a full-time basis.
   Ovadia Keidar, 48, an Israeli agronomist who lives in Cairo with
his wife and three of his five children, said the relationship
between Israelis and Egyptians remains tentative, complex and often
emotional.
   ``The peace agreement is not something that you can switch on and
off. You make the peace gradually, breaking through one barrier and
then another. I believe that peace will survive the occasional ups
and down. What we have to do is understand each other.''
   Keidar was born in Egypt, speaks Arabic fluently and has a good
knowledge of the country. His family was forced out of Egypt after
the 1956 Suez war, and Keidar became a settler in the Sinai Desert
after it was captured by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   He then fought as an Israeli soldier on the Egyptian front in the
war of 1973, was uprooted from his Sinai settlement by the 1979
peace agreement and returned to work in Cairo five years ago.
   In the beginning, he said he was afraid for his safety but
eventually decided to stay.
   ``If I couldn't start here who could?'' he said
   Keidar said his battle for acceptance has produced mixed results.
He recalled that when his daughter was 5 years old she was excluded
from the birthday party of her best friend because her friend's
parents didn't want an Israeli in their home.
   ``She was very hurt and sad,'' he said.
   When his daughter turned 6, Keidar had a birthday party in a
restaurant and his daughter's friend attended.
   ``We met the parents there and became friendly,'' he said. ``One
of the parents studied with my cousin.''
   The Keidars now visit the Egyptian family in their home. But the
Egyptian family, who are related by marriage to Palestinians, have
yet to visit the Keidar home.
   ``There are still some barriers because of the Palestinian
problem, but I can understand them,'' said Keidar, adding he
believed relations would remain uneasy with Egypt until there was a
negotiated settlement of the future of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   The low point in Egyptian-Israeli relations came Oct. 5, 1985,
when seven Israeli tourists were killed when an Egyptian policeman
opened fire on a beach party at Ras Bourka in the Sinai. The
policeman, Suleiman Khatir, was sentenced to life in prison. He died
in jail as a result of what authorities said was a suicide.
   Earlier the same year, an Israeli Embassy employee, Albert
Atrakchi, 30, was assassinated by a gunman in Cairo.
   The only resident Israeli correspondent in Egypt, Yoram Mizrachi
of the liberal newspaper Haaretz, moves frequently to avoid being
targeted after the Egyptian weekly Al Ahali described him as a
dangerous man and published his address.
   Other Israelis, he said, use bodyguards because of resentment
among Egyptians.
   Mizrachi, who has been in Egypt about six months, recalled that
Egyptian journalists once demanded he leave a news conference.
   ``One of them called out that there was an Israeli present, and
they would not participate if I did. So I left.''
   Mizrachi said, however, he was able to move freely to cover the
news, visiting neighborhoods throughout Cairo and even the
Palestinian Liberation Organization.
   A former commander of Israeli troops in south Lebanon, Mizrachi
recently interviewed PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, risking censure and
possible prosecution at home for dealing with the outlawed group.

<HEAD>MLK's Son, President of King Center, Picks Up Civil Rights Mantle</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The younger son of Martin Luther King Jr. became
heir apparent of a movement when he stood in the pulpit of his
father's church on what would have been the civil rights pioneer's
60th birthday.
   Dexter Scott King declared that he, ``the son of a son of a
movement,'' was ready to take a leadership role. Out rolled the
resonant, vibrant baritone that 25 years earlier prodded blacks to
demand their share of the American Dream.
   For many, it was as if MLK himself had come home.
   But Dexter King is a quiet man with a small circle of friends,
lifts weights at home and prefers tennis and books on nutrition to
politics. He was planted squarely in his father's shoes with a
degree of reluctance.
   ``I was tapped. It was simply an issue of something that was
inevitable,'' he said. ``It surprised a lot of people, including
myself, because it's not the kind of thing that you can readily
prepare for.
   ``I had to come to grips with the fact that this life does not
belong to me, and although all of us like to think that we have a
choice in what our roles will be, I have to think of my father's
role.''
   Dexter King's Jan. 14 appointment as president of The King
Center, aimed at keeping his father's legacy alive, was a relief to
the civil rights community; pressure within the movement for someone
to take up the torch had been heavy.
   When Coretta Scott King made the announcement she pointed out
that Dexter, at 28, is about the same age his father was when he led
bus boycotts in Montgomery, Ala., that sparked the civil rights
movement.
   ``Being the son of the civil rights leader makes Dexter uniquely
qualified to assume the civil rights mantle,'' she said.
   Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, a member of the center's board of
directors and a longtime contemporary of Martin Luther King Jr.,
said Dexter's selection showed ``we are moving forward, carrying on
with another generation.''
   King says he doesn't want to have to fight with his father's
image.
   ``I have never felt like I or anyone else can walk in his shoes.
I can only follow and complement what he's already done. I've never
seen myself as one who just inherited leadership. There are certain
things you just can't inherit.''
   Yet there are things he did inherit, among them the calm, pensive
demeanor that was his father's trademark. Not the speaking style _
that went to younger sister Bernice _ but Dexter King does sound and
look like his dad.
   ``What he did was exclusive to him. I can only be my best self.
And if being my best self means that I achieve great things and
become a great leader, then I will be commended on that basis, ...
but not because people say `You're going to follow in your father's
footsteps.'''
   Larry Carter, dean of the Martin Luther King Jr. International
Chapel at Morehouse College, sees Dexter King as a peaceful man who
will function well as president of the center. ``He seems natural
for that, based on my assessment of his temperament. He's very
polite, he's very considerate.
   ``He's not a rip-roaring orator like his sister Bernice, but he's
capable of passion and has believability.''
   Carter, who has known King for about four years, said he never
knew whether the MLK image was a problem for Dexter King; he never
let it show.
   King, who attended Morehouse _ his father's alma mater _ but has
not graduated, is founder and president of Visionary Development
Corp., a business and development consulting firm. He also directs
the center's office of special events and entertainment and produced
a record marking the first federal King holiday in 1986.
   King said he was first considered for president of The King
Center two years ago, when there was ``some talk amongst the board
members and my mother'' about moving one of the four King children
into a leadership role.
   But Yolanda, 33, serves as the center's producing director of
cultural affairs and runs a theater group with Attallah Shabazz,
daughter of the late Malcolm X; Martin Luther King III, a retiring,
soft-spoken 31-year-old, is a Fulton County commissioner; and
Bernice, 25, is working toward a graduate degree in law and theology
at Emory University in Atlanta.
   ``At that time, I was not specifically targeted,'' King said.
``Recently, ... our immediate family more or less talked about the
fact that my mother is not getting any younger.''
   He explained that the changes, effective April 4 _ the 21st
anniversary of his father's assassination _ would ``free my mother
up and allow us to work as a team.'' King will manage the center's
administrative operations while his mother serves as spokeswoman and
chief executive officer.
   Some of the goals he has set for The King Center include getting
young people excited about a movement they are too young to
remember. He also wants to disseminate the center's message and
non-violent teachings.
   Another primary goal is to get the center on a steady financial
base, he said, with an endowment ``that allows us to
institutionalize our work so that we're not just trying to hang on
day by day or donation by donation.''
   He hopes it won't be too lonely at the top.
   ``I don't know a lot of young national and international leaders,
but I will be thrust into that role. It is lonely, and it is
frustrating because you really want to have people around you who
can really understand where you're coming from.''

<HEAD>Cape Town Wants To Be South Africa's First Desegregated City</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cape Town, South Africa's oldest
city, wants to be the country's first completely desegregated
municipality.
   ``We are striving toward prize No. 1, that the whole city is a
free settlement area. But the government is hardly likely to do
that,'' said Mayor Peter Muller. He meant the national government.
   National apartheid laws allow municipalities to decide whether to
open public amenities such as parks, beaches and buses. Cape Town is
the only major city with no segregated public facilities.
   But the national government holds the power to segregate
residential areas, schools and hospitals.
   The Cape Town City Council has petitioned repeatedly for the
right to declare its whole area, or sections of it, open to free
settlement. The law prohibited multiracial neighborhoods, although
parts of Cape Town and other cities are mixed, with non-whites
living illegally in designated white areas.
   On March 2, a new law took effect that will allow multiracial
neighborhoods on a limited basis. Muller believes that a section of
Cape Town will be the first area where all races can live together
legally since the governing National Party legislated residential
segregation in 1950.
   ``It's common cause that District Six will be the first free
settlement area,'' said Muller. He referred to a hillside near the
center of town where a squalid but lively multiracial neighborhood
was bulldozed in the 1960s and declared ``whites only.''
   District Six is now bordered by all-white apartment blocks and a
white technical school. But grass-covered lots, intersected by empty
streets and dotted with mosques and churches, lie vacant because
most Capetonians felt the demolition had stigmatized the area.
   ``Nobody with any kind of sensitivity would have taken it upon
themselves to in any way develop District Six,'' said Muller.
   Before cities were granted the right to open public amenities to
all races, the Cape Town City Council refused to enforce the
Separate Amenities Act. Instead of signs demarcating swimming pools
and toilets for ``whites'' or ``non-whites,'' Muller said, the
council put up notices warning ``disallowed people'' that they could
be prosecuted if they broke the law.
   ``But we didn't prosecute,'' he said.
   ``Right through the 1960s we fought the removal of the colored
(mixed-race) people from the voters' roll and as representatives on
the Council,'' recalled the City Council's executive committee
chairman, Dick Friedlander. He was mayor in 1972 when national law
forced the City Council to become all-white.
   ``We held protest meetings, we passed resolutions, we did all we
could,'' Friedlander said. ``Six of the 34 councilors were
legislated out of office.''
   ``Some of the colored councilors were elected from predominantly
white areas, and vice-versa,'' Muller said. ``We had gotten away
from racial stigma.''
   The people of mixed-race, Indonesian, Malaysian or Indian
ancestry whose religions, customs, language and architecture
contributed to Cape Town's historic and cultural attraction now have
no direct voice in how the city is run. They can elect neighborhood
management committees, which appoint delegates to a regional council.
   South Africa's Parliament sits in Cape Town, the legislative
capital. The first whites to settle in South Africa were merchants
from the Dutch East India Company who established a trading post in
Cape Town in 1652.
   The 1985 census put the population of greater Cape Town,
including suburbs, at 1.54 million _ 433,000 whites, 839,000
coloreds, 18,000 Asiatics and 254,000 blacks. City spokesman Ted
Doman said the blacks are grossly undercounted.
   Officially, no blacks live in Cape Town. The adjacent townships
of Langa, Nyanga and Crossroads were taken from the City Council's
control, although the city provides most of the water, sewerage and
fire protection services that exist in those areas.
   ``We feel a moral, if not a strategic, obligation to make sure
those places have the highest quality of life they can expect,
bearing in mind the shanty type of existence there,'' said Muller.

   Former President Reagan has waived his fee
for appearing at a conference here, but officials said he wasn't
influenced by the fact that more than three quarters of the tickets
remain unsold.
   Reagan is scheduled to appear Monday at Arizona State University
as part of an ``Insuring Tomorrow'' leadership conference. His
speaking fee wasn't disclosed when conference organizers arranged
for his appearance. The former president has signed a
$50,000-a-speech lecture contract.
   Neil Giuliano of the Alumni Association said Reagan waived his
honorarium Monday during negotiations between school officials and
the Washington Speaker's Bureau.
   ``I believe we put forth a very strong case that this is the kind
of program that is important for him to come to,'' Giuliano said.
   Only 2,200 of 10,000 tickets for the appearance at the school's
Activity Center had been sold. Ticket prices ranged from $10-$25.
   Giuliano insisted the slow ticket sales were not a factor in the
decision. People who have bought tickets will receive refunds, he
said.
   Other conference speakers were to include Rep. Pat Schroeder,
D-Colo., and David Gergen, editor of U.S. News &amp; World Report.

   Lawmakers rejected reinstating the death
penalty after 137 years, even for drug dealers convicted of murder.
   ``We have a history of five generations without the death
penalty, and I do not believe the people of Rhode Island are ready
for that,'' Rep. Mabel Anderson said Tuesday as the House Judiciary
Committee defeated two capital punishment bills.
   The committee, by a 15-1 vote, turned down a broad death-penalty
bill and handed a 13-3 defeat to Gov. Edward D. DiPrete who had
proposed legislation targeting ``drug kingpins'' who kill.
   Similar bills are pending in the state Senate, but committe
chairman Jeffrey J. Teitz promised to block them if they reach the
House.
   ``All the evidence we have before us clearly demonstrates that
the death penalty does not serve as a deterrent to crime,'' said
Teitz.
   Rhode Island abolished capital punishment in 1852 because of
fears a man may have been wrongly hanged eight years earlier. An
attempt to restore capital punishment for prison killings in the
mid-1970s was found unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   Greenpeace protesters today dumped
outside the U.S. Embassy seven barrels of chemical waste they
claimed was collected from outfall pipes at an American base in
Antarctica.
   Peter Wilkinson, a spokesman for the environmental group, said
the waste showed high levels of heavy metals, such as cadmium, and
that the protest was part of a stepped up campaign for a cleanup of
the McMurdo base.
   Embassy spokesman Mike Gould dismissed claims that the contents
were toxic, saying the liquid was nothing more than normal organic
sewage.
   He said the delivery of the drums was ``nothing but public
posturing.''
   ``The Americans are causing a lot of environmental problems in
Antarctica,'' Wilkinson said. ``They have one of the worst records.
They must have a sense of responsibility and we are going to make an
example out of them.''
   Lined up in front of the embassy gate, the barrels read ``Danger!
Cadmium.''
   Wilkinson said the waste was collected during the group's recent
expedition to Antarctica. He accused the United States of gross
neglect of the fragile environment there, saying Greenpeace had
detected chromium, lead and copper in wastes dumped into the ocean
from McMurdo.
   He said the level of cadmium was far in excess of that permitted
in Europe or the United States.
   The embassy called in local authorities to remove the barrels
after Greenpeace refused to take them away.
   Gould said Greenpeace had failed to acknowledge that the
Washington-based National Science Foundation, which oversees U.S.
activities in Antarctica, was committed to cleaning up McMurdo.
   McMurdo, the largest station in Antarctica, was set up in 1957.
Several hundred people work there during the Southern Hemisphere
summer.

<UNK>Hairdresser Wins First Beauty Contest In Post-War Saigon</UNK>

<TEXT>
   A 20-year-old hairdresser has won the
first beauty contest in Saigon since Communist forces overran the
capital of the U.S.-backed South Vietnam government in 1975,
Vietnamese media said.
   Do Thi Kieu Khanh beat out 216 other women ranging in age from 16
to 25 in the contest for the title of ``Miss Ao Dai 1989,'' the
official Vietnam News Agency said in a report seen in Bangkok today.
   Ao Dai is the long traditional Vietnamese dress. It has been
infrequently seen on Vietnam's streets since the war ended.
   The runners-up were Duong Nu Minh Tam, a 19-year-old high school
student, and Tran Thu Nga, a 16-year-old student at the city's
choreography school.
   ``In the competition, the contestants appeared before the
audience in Ao Dai, bathsuits and in clothes chosen by themselves,''
the report said. ``Besides, they had to answer some questions on
general knowledge.''
   The contest in Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City after the
independence leader, was jointly sponsored by the Women's Union and
The Women Weekly publication, the report said. It said the contest
was held recently.
   The nation's first beauty contest since the war was held last
November in the stubbornly staid capital of Hanoi. The strictures on
society, economy and politics have been relaxed under the
two-year-old rule of pragmatic Communist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh.

   The tart-tongued immigration chief
suggested a congressman stick his finger in an electrical socket
after he alleged her department was riddled with corruption.
   ``You as a person, you do not deserve to be called by a name
other than fumble face,'' shrieked Immigration Commissioner Miriam
Defensor Santiago in a statement to a Manila television station on
Tuesday.
   ``And you can go stick your finger in the wall socket.''
   Mrs. Santiago, a former judge, made the remark in response to
Rep. Mario Joaquin's claim in the House of Reprsentatives on Monday
that the Commission on Immigration and Deportation was fraught with
corruption.
   Mrs. Santiago said she wanted to challenge Joaquin ``to a fist
fight'' to defend her reputation. There was no immediate response
from the congressman.
   Since her appointment last year, Mrs. Santiago has cultivated a
reputation for honesty and efficiency in a bureaucracy riddled with
graft, corruption and inefficiency.
   She once warned immigration officers at Manila airport that she
was aware of their corrupt practices and would cut them into small
pieces and ``feed you to the sharks in Manila Bay.''
   She then added that the sharks would probably not devour the
officials out of ``professional courtesy.''
   Critics, however, claim the commission is still corrupt and that
Mrs. Santiago has run roughshod over employees to enhance her
reputation and launch a political career.

   A federal jury found two Transit Authority police
officers guilty Tuesday of falsely arresting eight subway riders on
trumped-up charges.
   Officers Alphonse Iannacone, 42, an 18-year veteran of the
transit department, and Mary McDermott, 32, a transit police officer
since 1980, were each charged with seven counts of conspiring to
violate civil rights and one count of deprivation of civil rights.
   The jury convicted them on all counts after deliberating for
three days.
   The officers face up to 71 years in prison each and stiff fines
when they are sentenced May 10 by U.S. District Judge Shirley Wohl
Kram.
   Prosecutors called more than 20 witnesses _ including the eight
men arrested by Iannacone and McDermott in 1983 and 1984, and the
eight ``victims'' of those men.
   The men, all of whom were black, Hispanic or Asian, testified
they were taken off subway trains, handcuffed and detained on
charges of either sexual abuse or attempted grand larceny.
   The alleged ``victims,'' seven women and one man, described their
shock at learning they were listed as the complainants in the cases.
None had sought police assistance. The man said he was not a
pickpocket victim and the women said nothing was missing from the
purses and they had not felt anyone touching them in a lewd way.
   Relatives of the two officers shouted ``Oh no!'' and ``How could
they do this?'' as the verdict was announced. Ms. McDermott appeared
to have tears in her eyes and Iannacone appeared shaken.
   ``It's really hard for a police officer to get a fair trial,''
said defense attorney Barry Agulnick. He and the other defense
lawyer, Kenneth Kaplan, said they would appeal.
   Transit Police Chief Vincent Del Castillo issued a statement
saying, ``While we can never be pleased by the conviction of any
police officers, we are pleased that this old and lingering issue
has finally been resolved.''
   The defense had two witnesses. A lieutenant who once taught at
the transit academy explained that discrepancies between arresting
officers' notes and those of the prosecutor are not unusual, and a
psychologist testified that victims of sex abuse often deny it
occurred.

   American men and women are highly susceptible to
love and money but differ over whether they have enough sex and
self-esteem, according to a poll released by Glamour magazine.
   Nine of 10 Americans are satisfied with their lives; 73 percent
of men and women said they were in love with someone, according to
the unscientific survey released Tuesday.
   People ``feel increasingly attractive as they gain in income,''
with only 2 percent of those earning more than $35,000 a year
expressing dissatisfaction with their looks, according to the poll.
   The survey was mailed to 1,620 households by Mark Clements
Research Inc. The poll results were based on nearly 70 percent of
the questionnaires that were returned between Sept. 30 and Oct. 31,
Glamour said in its April issue.
   Other findings:
   _Fifty-one percent of men and 26 percent of women said they would
like to have sex more often.
   _Nearly 40 percent of men said they were very satisfied with the
degree of self-esteem and confidence they possess, compared with
about 30 percent of women.
   _Ninety-six percent of women and 92 percent of men think
companionship and friendship are the most important elements in a
marriage. Most women ranked ability to express feelings second most
important and fidelity third; men, for the most part, valued
fidelity second and the expression of feelings third.
   _Nearly 70 percent of men and women cited respectful treatment by
superiors as the most important element in their jobs. However, only
one-third felt good about the respect they receive at work.

   Nashville, Tenn., radio station WSIX is the
nation's best in country music and Southern California's Crazy Horse
Steak House &amp; Saloon is the top nightclub, the Academy of Country
Music said in announcing awards Tuesday.
   There was a tie for disc jockey of the year between Jon Conlon of
WGKX radio in Memphis, Tenn., and Dandalion of WRKZ in Hershey, Pa.
Dandalion is the first female ever to win the honor.
   It was the third consecutive country nightclub of the year honor
for the Crazy Horse, an Orange County honkytonk within the Santa Ana
city limits 30 miles south of Los Angeles.
   The winners announced Tuesday will get their ``hat'' trophies
April 10 during the 24th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards
ceremony at the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. The show will be a
two-hour special on NBC-TV.
   Balloting is currently under way for entertainment awards.
   K.T. Oslin, who emerged as 1988's robust queen of down-home music
with ``Eighties Ladies,'' led with five nominations, including best
record for ``I'll Always Come Back.''
   The nominees included eight who got three nominations apiece,
including such venerable performers as Reba McEntire, Randy Travis
and Hank Williams Jr.
   The winners are decided by ballots cast by the academy's 2,000
winners.

   James Johns laid aside his crutches, pulled
himself painfully into the barber's chair, then received his first
haircut in two months.
   ``I hope this makes you feel better,'' said Jerry W. Huff, a
36-year-old hair stylist who donates his labor every week to the
grooming of homeless people. ``It always does.''
   Huff, who calls himself Super Barber, said haircuts can spruce up
a homeless person's self-esteem, often the first casualty when men
or women are down on their luck. He has been giving out free
haircuts and shampoos for about a year.
   ``It's just scissors and a comb and a little overhead. I feel
like I want to help. If I can get one of 20 motivated, that's good,
isn't it?'' he said Tuesday.
   Working on Johns' hair, Huff said: ``I'm going to make you look
like that fellow in `Gone With The Wind' _ Clark Gable.''
   Johns said the haircut would be an improvement, in any case. The
54-year-old former truck driver and service station worker suffers
from rheumatism and has lived at the Salvation Army center in nearby
Anniston for 18 months.
   ``I'm out of work and didn't have anywhere else to stay,'' he
said. ``They were kind enough to take me in and give me work sorting
shoes.''
   Alex Reaves, also 54, has suffered from emphysema for three years
and subsists by doing occasional carpentry at the Salvation Army.
   ``I can't work regular. I wish I could,'' he said, while Huff cut
his hair. ``I'm sure glad to get a haircut.''
   Huff bought buns and soft drinks for the men who came for cuts
Tuesday, and restaurateur Betty Walker donated barbecue meat.
   ``I get so motivated every time I do this,'' said Huff, 36, who
normally charges $8 for a haircut. ``When I get depressed, I do
charity work and it makes me feel better.''
   Huff said he dons a Santa Claus outfit the week before Christmas
to cut hair for needy children.

<HEAD>Parliament Disrupted By Secret Inquiry Into Gandhi Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Opposition legislators forced Parliament
to adjourn Tuesday after a newspaper gave its account of a secret
inquiry into the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   The report in the Indian Express newspaper said the investigation
cast suspicion on Rajendra Kumar Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal
secretary when she was shot Oct. 31, 1984, in the garden of her New
Delhi residence by two of her Sikh bodyguards.
   Dhawan, 52, did not continue in that job after Mrs. Gandhi's son,
Rajiv Gandhi, took over as prime minister, but he was appointed last
month as an officer on special duty in the powerful Cabinet
Secretariat.
   Speaker Balram Jakhar adjourned the session of the People's House
_ lower house of Parliament _ when opposition members demanded the
secret report be made public.
   Jakhar called their actions ``shameful'' and adjourned the
sessions after about two hours of heated argments between the
opposition and deputies of the governing Congress Party.
   The government said the report was kept secret in the interest of
national security.
   The Indian Express, headquartered in Bombay, is the country's
largest English-language newspaper with a circulation of 1.1 million
and frequently criticizes Rajiv Gandhi and his administration.
   It gave this account of the secret report under a front-page
headline ``What has been withheld from all:''
   _The inquiry by Supreme Court Justice M.P. Thakkar showed that
``consciously or unconsciously Dhawan may have facilitated the
commission of the crime.''
   _Thakkar claimed Dhawan lied during questioning and gave
unconvincing explanations about suspicious entries in his diary,
which included the name of one of the assassins.
   _Dhawan altered the time of Mrs. Gandhi's appointment with a
television crew on the morning of the assassination. The prime
minister was killed when walking from her residence to her office
next door for the television interview.
   _Dhawan, who was walking with Mrs. Gandhi, fell back ``in the
nick of time as they were approaching the scene of the
assassination.''
   _Dhawan knew Beant Singh, one of the killers who was slain by
other bodyguards minutes after the assassination, but he denied that
during questioning.
   A second guard convicted of the assassination and a third Sikh
found guilty of conspiracy were executed.
   The government reported Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an
army raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the Sikhs'
holiest shrine.
   At least 1,200 people, most of them Sikhs, were killed in the
raid on the temple in Amritsar. The government said Sikh militants
had turned the temple complex into a hideout for terrorists.
   Sikh activists have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
homeland in the northern state of Punjab. They accuse Hindus of
discrimination.
   Sikhs form only 2 percent of India's population of 880 million
but they are in a majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise 80 percent of
the nation's population.

<TEXT>
   ABC seems to have successfully plugged the hole
that ``Moonlighting'' left in its Tuesday schedule.
   Last week, ``Roseanne'' took the top spot in the A.C. Nielsen Co.
ratings and was followed in the top 10 by the new ``Anything But
Love'' and the newly moved ``The Wonder Years.''
   If NBC's Thursday lineup slid a bit, its Monday movie had the
highest Monday movie rating since ``The Burning Bed'' in 1984.
``Those She Left Behind,'' the story of a husband (Gary Cole) whose
wife dies, leaving him to care for a newborn, ranked third last week.
   NBC won the week, its 38th straight victory, tying its record for
longest winning streak.
   For the week, NBC had an average, prime-time rating of 16.0 to
ABC's 12.3 and CBS' 12.1. NBC leads in the season-to-date averages
with a 16.1, followed by ABC's 12.8 and CBS' 12.6.
   ``Anything But Love,'' a half-hour comedy about '80s romance
starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Richard Lewis, was this season's
highest-rated premiere since ``Roseanne.''
   ``Roseanne'' had once before edged ``The Cosby Show'' for first
place _ ``Cosby'' came in second _ but that was a repeat. Last week,
each show attracted a 40 share, but ``Roseanne'' had a rating of
27.7 to ``Cosby's'' 25.3. NBC said ``Cosby'' was affected by
basketball playoffs carried on some independent stations Thursday
night. It was the highest-rated ``Roseanne'' episode yet.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions.
The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   The top-10 shows of the week were: ``Roseanne'' ABC, ``The Cosby
Show'' NBC, ``Those She Left Behind'' NBC, ``60 Minutes'' CBS,
``Who's the Boss?'' ABC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``Anything But
Love'' ABC, ``The Wonder Years'' ABC, ``Cheers'' NBC and ``Murder,
She Wrote'' CBS.
   Fox, which has done well with the reality-based crime show
``America's Most Wanted'' on Sunday, seems to have successfully
added ``COPS'' on Saturday. The hour-long premiere had a rating of
7.5 and a 13 share.
   In news, ``The CBS Evening News'' remained in first place with a
rating of 11.5 and a 21 share. ``ABC World News Tonight'' had an
11.2 and a 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 10.2 and 19.

<TEXT>
   Hilda Barahona steps across a
mountain of garbage and contends with vultures, dogs and pigs for
edible or saleable refuse from homes better than her own.
   She won't bother to vote on Sunday, when this small Central
American nation wracked by civil war chooses a new president.
   ``One wants to believe that changing the government could improve
things. But one sees that they stay the same. The poor remain poor
and disdained,'' she says.
   More than 200 men, women and children _ toddlers to the aged and
infirm _ scavenge through the Soyapango dump, five miles east of San
Salvador, every day beneath a searing tropical sun and despite an
intense stench.
   Dump trucks and bulldozers, their drivers' faces covered against
the smell with kerchiefs or surgical masks, traverse the two-acre
pile.
   Of 15 voting-age people interviewed, five said they planned to
cast a ballot Sunday _ most because it was a ``duty of
citizenship.'' Voting is legally required here, although there is no
real sanction for not voting.
   Seven parties are contesting the election, the second
presidential vote since 1982, when the country began a rough journey
toward representative constitutional rule.
   Before that, this nation of 5.5 million had been governed
throughout its modern history by an alliance of landed oligarchs and
the armed forces.
   This year, for the first time, Salvadoran voters have a chance to
replace the party in power with a party that has a completely
different outlook.
   The incumbent Christian Democrats are trailing the opposition
rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena, with the leftist
Democratic Convergence running third.
   Arena's economic philosphy revolves around the marketplace and
private enterprise. The party says it will institute ``capitalism
for the masses.'' Although it is hard to see how denizens of the
dump would accumulate capital, the only one who would express a
preference said he was voting for Arena.
   ``We're not here because we like this work,'' said Rene Antonio
Vasquez, who will not vote. ``We're here out of necessity. It's the
only option we have. We have to feed our kids.''
   The 19-year-old father of two has worked as a construction
laborer, but such employment is sporadic. He has spent most of the
past 12 years scrounging through the Soyapango dump. For nine of
those years, the nation has been in a civil war between
U.S.-supported government forces and the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front.
   Unemployment nationwide is estimated at near 40 percent. Over
half the population is illiterate. Fewer than a quarter of rural
Salvadorans have access to safe drinking water. El Salvador has the
highest rate of infant mortality in Central America; the main cause
is diarrhea.
   The country has been the Western Hemisphere's biggest recipient
of U.S. aid this decade. Despite the donation of more than $3 bilion
in U.S. economic and military assistance since 1980, several major
indices, including availability of potable water, have worsened
rather than improved.
   Gilberto Rivera, 23, supports his mother, sister and niece with
the $4 he earns scavenging on an average day. Plastic fetches three
cents a pound, scrap metal one cent, paper three cents and iron two
cents.
   ``One government is just like another,'' he said of the election.
``They're of no matter to us.''
   He said scavenging has its hazards, principally exposure to
disease. The septic environment is particularly harmful to the
children.
   Francisca Aguilar, 37, her hands caked with black grime, talked
as she stooped and ripped open a plastic bag. She picked through the
contents _ melon rinds, eggshells, chicken bones and empty
containers _ separating plastic and glass while tossing organic
morsels aside to be snatched up by gray-headed vultures hopping
through the trash.
   Her 14-year-old daughter Lidia worked beside her. Lidia attended
school through second grade, but had to leave because the $3 her
mother makes each day from the dump isn't enough for notebooks and
shoes and clothes to keep her five children in school.
   ``I've only got the boy (her one son) studying,'' Mrs. Aguilar
said.
   Lidia withdrew a pair of eyeglasss with a missing lens from the
rubbish. She put them on and continued sifting.

   Ahem! No coughing, please.
   Heeding a plea in the concert program, hundreds of winter cold
and flu sufferers at the University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium
made a collective effort not to cough during violinist Isaac Stern's
concert last week.
   The coughing has been so bad this winter that the audience has
been dubbed ``the Hancher Hackers.''
   A review of a January concert devoted as much space to the
coughing as to the performance by Japanese pianist Mitsuko Uchida,
said Judith Hurtig, Hancher's marketing director.
   So, she said, she and Hancher Director Wallace Chappell devised a
letter to insert in the program asking concertgoers to suppress
their coughs.
   ``We all know that an Iowa winter brings flu and colds,'' the
letter said. ``But we would like to ask our audience to be
considerate of others.
   ``There is little the Hancher staff can do to control the
coughers. We must rely on the politeness of our audience and ask
that they be considerate. Coughs can be muffled. The ushers have
cough drops, which are freely given to those who request them.''
   As a last resort, the letter said, audience members could leave
the concert hall and hear the rest of the performance in soundproof
observation booths.
   ``It was astonishing the effect it had _ stunning,'' Ms. Hurtig
said.

   Getting into the Easter spirit, the
Village Board has lifted a ban against bunnies.
   Since the 1960s, an ordinance had prohibited everyone except
slaughterhouses and meat packing plants from keeping rabbits and
some other kinds of animals.
   But after the ordinance was criticized by residents who had been
secretly raising rabbits, the board voted 4-2 Monday night to take
rabbits off the list of undesirable animals.
   Like dogs and cats, rabbits will have to be licensed and will be
limited to two per household.
   Village President Daniel Gorski, who said he is not an animal
hater, voted against the proposal, saying: ``We had people with
rabbits behind my house, and they had unsightly hutches.''
   But Trustee Jack Olson, who voted for the measure, joked: ``We
have to (allow rabbits) because Easter is coming.''
   Some residents had been raising rabbits secretly for years, and
last fall a new road was paved to make way for a subdivision. During
construction, a section of trees had to be removed, exposing once
hidden hutches.
   A police officer noticed the hutches and notified the Village
Board.
   The families raising the rabbits were told to remove the animals
by Jan. 1. Rather than give their rabbits away, they fought the
ordinance.
   ``Why would they (Village Board) make us get rid of them?''
resident Carol Werner asked. ``Do they bark at night and keep the
neighbors awake all night?''

   Negotiators reached a last-minute settlement
Tuesday night, averting a strike that would have paralyzed city
buses, trolleys and subways that carry 400,000 commuters to work
daily.
   The three-year contract agreement was announced shortly before
the midnight strike deadline by Louis J. Gambaccini, general manager
of the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, and Roger
Tauss, president of Transport Workers Union Local 234.
   ``We think we have, what is in our opinion, a fair agreement all
around,'' Gambaccini said. ``It was a tough, tough negotiation.
   ``I would like to say that the union has been admirable in its
seriousness in its approach and we tried to respect that. I could
not have asked for a better, earnest effort,'' he said.
   Tauss also said he was happy with the agreement.
   Gambaccini and Tauss refused to reveal any terms of the agreement
until a union membership meeting Wednesday.
   The sticking point in negotiations had been wages, pensions and
SEPTA's demand that the union absorb projected increases in
health-care costs by paying some of the premiums or approving a cut
in benefits.
   The authority has projected its health care costs would increase
from a current $20 million to $30 million in the next three years.
   The news left workers gathered at a North Philadelphia depot
relieved.
   ``I feel good about the news, because I know if they got us a
contract, they got us a hell of a good one, and I know we don't have
any Blue Cross-Blue Shield to pay,'' said Jean Alexander, a union
spokeswoman.
   Leaders of Local 234, which represents about 5,200 city bus,
trolley and subway operators, had said the strike would begin at
12:01 a.m. Wednesday, when the contract expired, if there was no
agreement.
   Contract negotiations had resumed with a state mediator ordering
both sides to avoid public statements after transit workers hinted
there was nothing on the table to head off the city's fourth transit
strike in 12 years.
   Before the announcement, police prepared to put extra officers on
traffic control duty for the Wednesday morning rush, and the Bicycle
Coaltion of Delaware Valley set up a phone line to offer information
on bicycle routes.
   The authority told commuters it would add trains to regional rail
lines, which would not be affected, and make more stops through the
city.
   The transit workers last struck for four days in 1986. Previous
walkouts included a 44-day strike in 1977, a 19-day strike in 1981,
a 108-day strike in 1983.

   Law enforcement officials reacted with
enthusiasm Tuesday after the Bush administration banned imports of
semiautomatic assault weapons, including the type used to kill five
schoolchildren in Stockton.
   ``This is great news,'' said state Attorney General John Van De
Kamp. ``Today's action is long overdue and I urge the administration
to make it permanent.''
   ``I congratulate the president and the administration. But my
response from the heart is, thank God for Barbara Bush,'' said city
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, referring to the first lady's outspoken
opposition to assault weapons.
   The order suspends the importation of more than 110,000
assault-type weapons for which import applications are pending, said
national drug control director William J. Bennett.
   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,
FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomatic
weapons.
   On Jan. 17, a disturbed drifter, Patrick Purdy, used an AK-47 to
kill five children and wound 30 other people at Grover Cleveland
Elementary School in Stockton.
   Using the weapon, which allows the shooter to fire single shots
as quickly as he can pull the trigger, Purdy was able to fire 106
bullets in two minutes. He then shot and killed himself with a
handgun.
   A rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gang
warfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns. But the
Stockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwide
movement to ban assault weapons.
   On Monday, the California Assembly narrowly passed legislation
that would virtually ban the sale of all semiautomatic assault
weapons. The weapons have already been banned by local ordinances in
Los Angeles and Cleveland.
   Van De Kamp said he thought the Stockton shootings and the move
to restrict assault weapons in California ``have had a tremendous
impact on the administration's thinking on this issue.''
   Assemblyman Michael Roos of Los Angeles, who wrote the Assembly
bill, said he ``can't stop shaking from the excitement.''
   ``Not in my wildest imagination would I have ever dreamed that
within 24 hours of the Assembly taking action that the United States
government ... would effectively ban the importation of these
weapons,'' Roos said.
   The state Senate passed a similar bill last week. The differences
between that bill and the House's must be resolved before the
governor can sign legislation.
   The Bush administration's action Tuesday also brought praise from
Roberg Strang, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration
in New York.
   ``Certainly, anything that's done is helpful to us,'' Strang
said. ``In the last year, agents across the country have been issued
submachine guns because of the automatic weapons that we're up
against on a daily basis. ... Certainly, anything we can do to
lessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to be
beneficial to us.''

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's party is
loudly downplaying its recent string of election setbacks but
quietly eyeing a possible change at the top.
   Kohl's popularity among West Germans has plunged in recent
months, and the party's fortunes appear to be following him. The big
test, the national elections that choose a federal chancellor, is in
December 1990.
   Some key political figures already have begun distancing
themselves from Kohl, whose image has been bruised by a chemical
weapons scandal, indecisiveness over NATO strategy and numerous
domestic troubles.
   Not the least of his problems is a series of poor showings by his
Christian Democrats in regional elections, which some party regulars
worry may be a harbinger of the national race.
   The party lost its legislative majority in West Berlin on Jan.
29, and public opinion polls conducted since indicate Kohl's
conservative party would lose to the left-leaning Social Democrats
if national elections were held today.
   On Sunday, the Christian Democrats lost control of the Frankfurt
city council and other important local legislatures in balloting
throughout Hesse state.
   The conservative Bonn daily Die Welt suggested Tuesday that the
party could use a ``fresh start'', with Baden-Wuerttemberg state
governor Lothar Spaeth replacing Kohl.
   ``Lothar Spaeth is certainly very suitable as chancellor,''
Stuttgart Mayor Manfred Rommel, a prominent Christian Democrat, said
in an interview for today's edition of the Bild newspaper.
   Such speculation is bad news for the Christian Democrats, who
lack a clear majority in the federal parliament, controlling the
government through a delicate alliance with the liberal Free
Democratic Party.
   The Free Democrats also suffered in the Hesse elections, and
party leader Otto Lambsdorff hinted that the relationship with
Kohl's party was being re-evaluated.
   ``We have no cause to stick our head between our knees,''
Lambsdorff said Monday. ``We have considerable doubts about the way
the campaign in Frankfurt was conducted in the final days and weeks
with regard to policies on foreigners, asylum-seekers and
immigrants.''
   Right-wing extremists of the National Democratic Party won 6.6
percent of the vote in elections to the Frankfurt city council,
focusing on what the federal government should do to slow the influx
of foreigners.
   Likewise, the Christian Democrats' showing in the world arena has
not generated many popularity points.
   The leadership has taken a beating over its handling of U.S.
charges that West German companies helped build a suspected chemical
weapons plant for Libya, and over its refusal to be pinned down on
whether it will support NATO plans to modernize short-range nuclear
missiles on West German soil.
   The head of the Christian Democrats' Bavarian sister party, the
Christian Social Union, described the outcome of Sunday's elections
as ``catastrophic,'' but resisted suggestions that a new candidate
for chancellor is needed.
   ``The chancellor is elected, he is the party's national leader,
and I don't know anyone who wants to relieve him,'' Christian Social
Union leader Theodor Waigel told the ARD television network.
   Meeting reporters Monday, Kohl alternately exuded confidence and
defensiveness as he downplayed the Hesse elections and his tumble in
the polls.
   ``We have every chance to win the federal elections,'' Kohl said.
   He blamed the Christian Democrats' poor showing in Hesse on
unpopular but necessary social security and tax reforms.
   Kohl conceded that the party finds itself ``in a very serious
situation'' and must consider major policy revisions during a
conference planned in mid-April.
   But the chancellor bristled at questions about whether he would
bow out of the competition for the party's nomination for
chancellor, claiming he had ``survived'' political setbacks before
and faced the next campaign ``with great composure.''
   Kohl noted that the fringe parties, the ultra-rightist National
Democratic Party and the far-left Greens party _ not the rival
Social Democrats _ were the biggest beneficiaries of the Christian
Democrats' losses.
   However, the Social Democrats in West Berlin have entered into an
alliance with the far-left Alternative List group to gain control of
the city-state's government in the wake of the Christian Democrat
losses.
   Some political observers say such an alliance could happen
nationally, creating a liberal block strong enough to oust the
Christian Democrats.

   Moslem anger over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a novel
they say insults their faith, has renewed debate over Britain's
ancient, rarely used blasphemy law.
   The law, which has been cited in court just twice in the past 67
years, applies only to the Christian state Church of England.
   Its failure to embrace other religions was among the reasons the
Law Commission, an independent panel of academics and jurists,
called in 1985 for its abolition.
   But others, including Moslems, are fighting to extend the law to
other religions to reflect Britain's multi-ethnic society.
   Moslems say it would give them legal ground for opposing Salman
Rushdie, the author of ``The Satanic Verses,'' without resorting to
the violence urged by Iranian leaders who have called for his death.
   Eight Moslem lawyers failed Monday to persuade a London
magistrate to summon Rushdie to court on charges of blasphemous and
seditious libel, but they vowed to press their cause.
   ``What we are asking is that the law should be changed so that it
gives equal status to all citizens,'' said Liaqat Hussain,
secretary-general of the Bradford-based Council For Mosques.
   Moslems say ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam by
associating the prophet Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting
that the Koran, Islam's holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not
Allah's work.
   Rushdie, born to a Moslem family in India, is a British citizen.
He has been in hiding in England since Feb. 14, when Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini ordered Moslems to kill him.
   The British government has refused to review the blasphemy law.
``There is no general consensus for reform,'' says the Home Office.
   John Vincent, a Bristol University history professor, wrote in
The Times of London that the government's position ``looks narrowly
ethnocentric.''
   Cases of blasphemy and its written form, blasphemous libel, date
to the time when church and state were indivisible and an attack on
Christianity was regarded as subversion. But church power waned, and
the law came under secular court jurisdiction in 1676.
   As part of the system of common rather than statute law, offenses
are decided by legal precedent and punishments are set by the
courts. Judges have wide discretion, since there is no definition
for blasphemy.
   Blasphemy is generally considered as the use of scurrilous,
abusive, vilifying, ludicrous or offensive words about God or
Christ, the Christian religion, the Bible, or the ``formularies of
the Church of England as by law established.'' Material must be
deemed strongly offensive to break the law.
   Other European nations also have such laws, especially the
strongly Roman Catholic ones, including Ireland, Italy, Spain and
Portugal, says Nicholas Walter, an expert on blasphemy. ``But they
are not often used,'' he says.
   Holland's law bans blasphemy that is deliberately intended to
offend religious feelings. But the Justice Ministry has decided
Rushdie's book did not break it.
   In France, which has no blasphemy law, activists have tried to
ban material on grounds of defamation.
   In the first British prosecution for blasphemy since 1922,
anti-pornography activist Mary Whitehouse sued Gay News magazine in
1977 for publishing an explicit poem about a Roman soldier's
homosexual fantasies over Christ's crucified body. The magazine and
editor Denis Lemon were fined $2,500, and Lemon drew a nine-month
suspended sentence. He lost an appeal.
   In September, state attorneys rejected Mrs. Whitehouse's demand
to prosecute the makers of the film ``The Last Temptation of
Christ'' for showing Christ dreaming of having sex with a prostitute.
   In its 3-2 decision in favor of abolishing the law, the Law
Commission held that it was wrong to single out one religion for
protection when ``members of society have a multiplicity of faiths
or none at all.''
   The commission noted that most of the public comment it received
during its four-year inquiry _ from 2,000 individuals or groups and
11,000 petition signatories _ supported retaining the law in some
form. But it said none of the proposed substitutes would work.
   Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie, spiritual head of the
Church of England, approves of extending the law to all religions,
an option Jewish and Moslem groups support.
   Opponents say such a change would have to give protection for any
organization calling itself a religion, including cults, and would
infringe upon freedom of speech.
   Supporters of an extended law see no threat to free speech.
Vincent argues that it is not denials or criticism of religion that
are blasphemous, but truly offensive, sometimes inflammatory
language.

<TEXT>
   Trucks and jeeps stand idle for lack of
fuel. Specially trained Bolivian police complain of too little food.
   It hasn't been a good week at this key base of operations for the
national war on drug trafficking.
   Indeed, U.S. and Bolivian officials say that despite improved
cooperation between their countries, the battle is being lost
because troops don't get enough logistic and economic support.
   ``Our biggest problem is the lack of resources,'' said Travis
Kuykendall, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's attache in
Bolivia.
   ``If Congress does not send checks to back us, they should send
us home,'' he said in an interview.
   U.S. aid for drug interdiction in Bolivia was cut from $15
million in 1988 to $10 million.
   ``We are doing everything we can to fight the cocaine trade, but
we are fighting a losing war if consumer nations do not increase
their support,'' Information Minister Herman Antelo told The
Associated Press.
   An elite U.S.-trained anti-drug police squad of 200 men, known as
the Leopards, and about 30 U.S. Drug Enforcement and Border Patrol
agents are based in Chimore, a tropical town in the heart of the
Chapare. It's a region east of Cochabamba city known for its
cultivation of coca, the plant whose dried leaves are the source of
cocaine.
   From Chimore, the men stage raids on cocaine paste processing
pits that lie hidden under the jungle canopy.
   During a weekend visit, however, police said they halted
operations because they did not have fuel for the vehicles or enough
food for the Bolivian forces.
   The United States has donated eight rebuilt Huey helicopters to
cover an area the size of Texas. Five were operational during the
weekend, but were being deployed in another region of the country,
the Beni plains.
   So coca leaf buying and selling was brisk along the main Chapare
highway.
   On better weeks, Bolivian police helped by the American agents
raid hundreds of crude cocaine processing pits.
   But the increased police presence has led many processors to set
up camp outside range of the base's ground vehicles and even
choppers, according to Drug Enforcement agents who asked not to be
identified.
   Gov. Bob Martinez of Flordia visited the Chapare region Tuesday
under tight security because of reports an assassination squad of
Colombian drug dealers was in the area.
   ``We had some information that was not confirmed that there was a
Colombian hit team in the area,'' said U.S. Drug Enforcement agent
Gene Castillo. He accompanied Martinez, who arrived in Bolivia
Monday, and U.S. Ambassador Robert Gelbard on their tour of the
district. A dozen DEA agents and Bolivian police provided security
for the group.
   Martinez, commenting on the importance of the coca plant to the
area farmers, said, ``We can't win the war here, we are going to
have to win it in the U.S.''
   Authorities of both countries say cooperation has increased, and
they are confiscating more chemicals used to process cocaine.
According to the State Department, last year they seized 5,549
gallons of ether, 11,158 gallons of sulfuric acid, 927 tons of lime,
10,304 gallons of acetone and 1.5 million gallons of gasoline and
diesel fuel.
   ``Our main purpose in the Chapare is to stop the ability to get
precursor chemicals in and cocaine paste out,'' Kuykendall said.
``Then they can't sell paste and farmers will not have a market for
their leaves.''
   Raids on pits where the leaf is mashed and mixed with chemicals
are on the rise. Last year 3,542 pits were raided, compared with
1,112 in 1987, according to the State Department. Also last year,
authorities raided 24 laboratories where the paste is converted into
hydrochloric cocaine, the refined powder sniffed by drug users. In
1987, just eight were raided, the records show.
   But, in almost all cases, the processors manage to flee before
the raids. And the number of pits raided is believed to represent
only a small portion of Bolivia's cocaine industry, whose annual
profits are estimated at $300 million. Little if any real decline in
trafficking has been noted.
   According to U.S. officials, neither Bolivia nor the U.S.
government has a single plane capable of intercepting drug flights
out of the country. Large areas bordering Argentina, Peru and Brazil
have no police presence and drugs also move freely on the rivers.
   The United States bought eight powerful motorboats, and a crew
last week confiscated 950 pounds of cocaine paste on one river. But
they had to stop because they, too, ran out of fuel.

   Actor Don Johnson, recently reunited with
ex-wife, Melanie Griffith, says there are no hard feelings between
his girlfriends past and present _ in fact, they're as close as kin.
   ``We all consider each other family,'' Johnson said in April's
Fame magazine. ``Patti (D'Arbanville)'s part of the family. Miss
Pamela (Des Barres) is part of the family. Barbra (Streisand) is
part of the family.''
   Johnson and D'Arbanville have a son, Jesse, and he had highly
publicized romances with Des Barres and Streisand.
   Griffith and Johnson are expecting a child and have announced
plans to remarry.
   The actor shares similar familial feelings toward the cast and
staff of ``Miami Vice,'' the show that propelled him to stardom.
   ``We've all grown together. And I'm going to miss them,'' said
Johnson. ``I'm gonna miss the whole experience, whenever it does

   Penthouse magazine publisher Bob Guccione
testified that a former ``Pet of the Year'' who is suing him for $10
million was a potential Marilyn Monroe whom he had rescued from a
life of crime.
   Guccione said Tuesday that Anneka DiLorenzo, who alleges breach
of contract, sexual harassment and fraud, approached him at age 20,
eager to pose nude for Penthouse after seeing the publisher on a
talk show.
   Ms. DiLorenzo, whose real name is Marjorie Thoreson, was signed
to his company's first management contract in 1974, Guccione said.
She became the magazine's 1975-76 ``Pet of the Year.''
   Guccione cast her in his sexually explicit movie ``Caligula,''
which Ms. DiLorenzo now says was a pornographic film that ruined her
career. For Ms. DiLorenzo's role, Guccione paid for surgery to have
her breasts enlarged.
   ``I thought it was a leg up on prostitution in Las Vegas,
stealing cars, writing bum checks and building up a life of crime,''
Guccione testified. He said he cast her in the movie because
sexually she was ``extremely adroit'' and ``perfect for the part.''
   Guccione cited three actresses who appeared nude early in their
careers and became cinema sex symbols _ Marilyn Monroe, Brigitte
Bardot and Hedy Lamarr.
   ``I felt Anneka could emerge as the sex symbol of her time,'' he
said.
   Ms. DiLorenzo's lawyer, Murray Schwartz, told state Judge Elliott
Wilk that Guccione ``is probably one of the leading pornographers in
the United States.''

   Pope John Paul II, an outdoor enthusiast, went skiing
in the Apennine mountains in central Italy, state television
reported.
   The RAI network reported that the pontiff, who hiked and went
skiing frequently in his youth in Poland, took to the slopes Tuesday
at Campo Felice, a popular ski area 1{-hours from Rome.
   Two years ago, the pope took a few runs in the Apennines at the
winter resort of Ovindoli. In July 1984, he went skiing with
then-President Sandro Pertini near Trento in the northern Dolomite
mountains.

   Sentencing for Cher's boyfriend was postponed
because of a dispute over where he should perform community service
for smashing a photographer's camera.
   Municipal Court Judge Ronald Schoenberg indicated he will order
Rob Camilletti, 24, to pay $1,050 in fines, make restitution, do 300
hours of community service and serve 24 months probation, said City
Attorney's Office spokesman Mike Qualls.
   Schoenberg reset sentencing for April 4 after meeting Tuesday
with Deputy City Attorney Renee Laurents and defense lawyer John
Forbes. Ms. Laurents said the defense wants Camilletti to perform
community service in New York, where he lives.
   Camilletti pleaded no contest Feb. 28 to two counts of vandalism.
He was accused of trying to run down free-lance photographer Peter
Brandt with his Ferrari and smashing his camera outside Cher's home
Benedict Canyon home last July.
   Cher, 42, and Camilletti, a former bagel maker, pizza chef and
bartender, have been companions since meeting at a New York
nightclub on her 40th birthday.

   Longtime James Bond star Roger Moore said it wasn't
just fears about his baritone voice that led him to give up a
leading role in the latest Andrew Lloyd Webber musical.
   ``Actually, I think the voice would have stood up,'' Moore said
Tuesday in a BBC radio interview. ``It's just the whole technical
thing that would not have. It was a question of counting time and
when to come in and go out and finding those notes out of the air.''
   Moore had been rehearsing six weeks for the part of suave and
dashing George Dillingham in ``Aspects of Love,'' which opens next
month.
   ``I have had awful nightmares, really terrible,'' the 61-year-old
actor said.
   His replacement has not been announced, but Albert Finney and
Denis Quilley had been mentioned for the part.

<HEAD>Bush Endorses Third-World Debt Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush publicly endorsed a shift in
U.S. policy toward Third World debt, backing a proposal by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady for partial forgiveness of outstanding bank
loans to developing nations.
   Bush's approval of the plan, announced Tuesday night after a
meeting of the National Security Council, ended a period of White
House caution toward the debt-reduction scheme outlined by Brady
last Friday.
   The plan calls for commercial banks to forgive some of the $410
billion in debt run up by developing nations, mostly in Latin
America.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater had said Bush did
not want to react to the new proposal, which supplants a four-year
old U.S. policy of opposition toward debt forgiveness, too hastily.
   However, he said, after reviewing the proposal with the security
council, ``the president fully supports the concepts and processes
for debt reduction and economic growth outlined by Secretary Brady.''
   Fitzwater said the new policy also is supported by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III as well as the Federal Reserve system,
which reportedly had expressed some reservations to it.
   The new policy modifies a plan outlined in 1985 by then-Treasury
Secretary Baker calling for banks to issue new loans to developing
nations that instituted economic reforms, without forgiving any of
the outstanding debt.
   However, the ``Baker plan'' resulted in little in the way of new
bank loans to heavily indebted Third World nations.
   The new policy reflects a Bush administration decision to view
debt-reduction as a national security issue as well as an economic
one, particularly in the aftermath of riots in Venezuela aggravated
by austerity programs forced by that nation's debt burden.
   Brady's plan calls for banks to forgive part of the outstanding
debt by using money from the World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund as collateral.
   The plan also envisions banks swapping some of the debt for bonds
of lower face value.
   Brady unveiled the proposal last week in a speech to a conference
sponsored by the Bretton Woods Committee, a group devoted to
international economic issues.
   The plan was widely applauded by the international banking
community and by leaders in both debtor and creditor nations.
   However, the reluctance of the White House to back the plan
publicly when it was announced led to speculation of divisions
within the government over details.
   The security council decided that ``this was the best way to
proceed'' Fitzwater said, after what he said was a difficult
discussion at which a variety of viewpoints were expressed.

   A shootout between a grocer and robbers
wielding a semiautomatic gun ended with two intruders shot to death
and the store owner's 14-year-old son critically wounded, police
said.
   Three men, armed with a handgun and a Mac-10 semiautomatic
pistol, entered family-owned Chico's Mini Market on Tuesday
afternoon and ordered clerks to put their hands up, said Sgt. Danny
Sneed.
   The gunman with the Mac-10 then went to a rear kitchen area.
   ``The owner, in the back with his 14-year-old son, saw the guy
and reached for his (own) gun,'' Sneed said.
   The robber then sprayed the room with at least a dozen rounds and
the owner returned fire with a .357-caliber Magnum revolver, fatally
wounding two gunmen, Sneed said.
   The third robber fled without taking any money.
   The owner's son was shot in the right side and was listed in
critical condition at Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center,
Sneed said.
   Gerald Gerard Bennett, 18, of Compton, was pronounced dead at the
scene and Gerald Anthony Bennett, 26, of Compton was pronounced dead
at the hospital. The two men were not related, Sneed said.
   The names of the owner and his son were being withheld.
   The shooting in this suburb 10 miles south of downtown Los
Angeles occurred on the day President George Bush announced
suspensions of imports of semiautomatic weapons. The Mac-10 was not
affected by the suspension because it is American made.

<HEAD>Auditors Say NRC Fails To Spot Security Risks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has put
national security at risk by allowing newly hired personnel to start
work without security clearances and by failing to reinvestigate
many veteran workers, a government auditing agency said today.
   The General Accounting Office said it found that since 1983 about
10 percent of NRC employees who began working before their security
investigations were completed later left the agency because the
checks disclosed drug-related or other personal problems that made
them unacceptable security risks. It said nearly all workers are
granted this security waiver.
   The report was the subject of a public hearing today before a
House Government Operations subcommittee, which requested the GAO
investigation in 1987.
   At NRC headquarters in Rockville, Md., spokesman Robert Newlin
said, ``We are planning improvements in our programs that are
responsive to the GAO recommendations.'' He said details of these
changes would be revealed to the House panel.
   The GAO report criticized the NRC for failing to reinvestigate
nearly half of the approximately 10,600 people who hold security
clearances. Only those holding the most sensitive jobs are subjected
to reinvestigation, but the GAO said results of those probes
indicate a need to extend the practice to all workers.
   ``Reinvestigations revealed cleared persons with histories of
child molestation, drug abuse and criminal activities,'' the report
said.
   ``Periodic reinvestigations can highlight these problems and
provide NRC information needed to determine whether an employee
could be a possible candidate for activities, such as espionage,
that would endanger national security.''
   The GAO said it reviewed a sample of NRC's personnel security
files for clearances since 1983 and found several cases that
underscored the need for stronger security rules.
   It cited an example of an NRC branch chief who was granted the
highest level of security clearance in 1979 and then suspended in
1983 after the employee was indicted on 52 counts of interstate
transportation in aid of racketeering. The worker was found
innocent, but the NRC later fired him after learning that the worker
had a business interest in an outcall massage and escort service.
   The NRC said it does not reinvestigate workers with lower-level
clearances because of the added cost and because those employees
have only limited access to classified information.
   The report was critical of the NRC's practice of allowing new
hires to start before completion of background investigations by the
Office of Personnel Management or the FBI. It said the security
clearance process takes so long that the requirement is waived for
about 99 percent of new employees, including those with access to
nuclear weapons design data and other highly sensitive information.
   ``Waivers have become the rule rather than the exception,'' the
report said.
   The GAO investigators said a review of NRC files since 1983
showed that in about 10 percent of cases in which security clearance
requirements were waived the employees later were forced out.
   The report cited as an example a reactor operator examiner who
worked for more than a year without a security clearance before the
background check revealed that the employee had received treatment
for drug and alcohol abuse, had physically abused his wife and
children and had not filed a federal income tax return for 13 years.
   The GAO also criticized the NRC for failing to set rules on
security clearances for people who require unescorted access to
nuclear power plants. It said this was particularly important in
light of increasing threats of sabotage and arson directed at
nuclear plants. The NRC said in a report last summer that excluding
bomb threats, the number of such reported security threats had grown
from 84 in 1986 to 205 the following year.

   U.S. officials say the conviction of Lebanese
hijacker Fawaz Younis affirms the ``long-arm'' tactics they used to
lure him aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea with promises of
sex and drugs.
   The black-haired, bearded Younis, held in isolation since his
arrest in September 1987, was convicted Tuesday in U.S. District
Court of leading five heavily armed men aboard Royal Jordanian
Airlines flight 402 in Beirut, Lebanon, on June 11, 1985.
   The hijackers, members of Lebanon's Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem
group, held the 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours to
publicize their demands for aid in their battle against Palestinian
refugees.
   No one was killed in the incident, and Younis testified that he
led the hijacking under orders from the militia.
   Younis, 30, sat impassively as the jury of seven women and five
men returned a verdict rejecting his defense. He faces life
imprisonment.
   Minutes after the verdict was announced, Younis appeared relaxed,
smiling and chatting with his interpreter.
   ``I tried to prepare him,'' said court-appointed defense attorney
Francis D. Carter. ``He understands what happened. He really went
into the courtroom feeling that it was preordained.''
   Federal officials proclaimed the results an affirmation of a 1984
law asserting United States jurisdiction over the taking of American
hostages overseas.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the verdict means that
``those who violate the rights of U.S. citizens are hereby put on
notice that the American law enforcement system is capable of
exacting a penalty for these terroristic crimes, regardless of where
they occur.''
   Carter contested the government claim and said he would appeal.
   ``It is an outrage,'' Carter said, adding that the case ``was not
about the United States'' and the two Americans aboard the aircraft
were not harmed.
   Carter said he would appeal on grounds the United States ought
not to have jurisdiction in the case and on grounds the military was
involved in the arrest.
   Younis was lured aboard a yacht 13 miles off the coast of Cyprus,
in international waters in the Mediterranean Sea, on Sept. 13, 1987,
with the prospect of a drug deal and a party.
   He was slammed to the deck by members of the FBI hostage rescue
squad, then interrogated for four days aboard a Navy munitions ship.
After he gave a detailed confession, he was flown non-stop from the
deck of an aircraft carrier to Washington.
   Doctors later found he had suffered hairline fractures of both
wrists during the arrest, but during his interrogation, the swelling
was treated only with bags of ice.
   ``Mr. Younis did not expect an awful lot from the United States
after the means used to arrest him,'' Carter said.
   Younis was convicted on three counts:
   _Seizing hostages, with a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
   _Conspiracy to commit sky piracy, with a maximum sentence of five
years.
   _Hijacking a commercial airliner, with a maximum 20 years in
prison.
   He was found innocent on these counts:
   _Using or threatening violence against passengers or crew members
of a commercial airliner.
   _Destroying a civilian aircraft.
   _Carrying aboard a civilian aircraft devices likely to damage it.
   The jury was led from the courthouse under guard by U.S.
marshals, and it was impossible to ask them how they reached their
verdict.
   However, prosecution witnesses testified that Younis had ordered
the other hijackers not to harm the passengers and crew members. And
although the prosecution showed the jury a videotape of Younis
announcing the imminent destruction of the plane, there was no
evidence that he planted the explosives or gave an order to blow up
the $15 million Boeing 727.
   Judge Aubrey E. Robinson Jr. allowed the defense to call an
expert witness, author Helena Cobban, who testified that a Lebanese
in Younis' situation would be ``predisposed'' to follow orders to
hijack a plane in 1985.
   But the judge gave the jury stern instructions, telling them,
``Hijacking a plane is illegal. ... Obeying illegal orders ... is
not a defense.''
   Carter said he expected the the judge to issue a sentence in 30
to 45 days, and said he would be reviewing the record of the trial
to determine further gounds for appeal.
   A federal appeals court has already ruled that the arrest, while
not a model of law enforcement, was acceptable and that a written
confession signed by Younis could be used against him, closing that
avenue of appeal.

   Eighty percent of the tax benefits from
President Bush's proposed cut in capital-gains taxes would go to
people with incomes over $100,000 a year, congressional analysts say.
   An estimated 1.25 million couples and individuals who make more
than $100,000 and report capital gains would get tax cuts averaging
$12,315, according to a study by the staff of the Joint Committee on
Taxation. The 376,000 with incomes over $200,000 would get 60
percent of the total reduction, their cuts averaging $30,820.
   Despite such figures, Bush on Tuesday maintained that his plan is
``not a special tax break for the rich.''
   The estimates were presented Tuesday to the Senate Finance
Committee, which heard the Treasury Department hail Bush's proposal
as one of the most important things Congress could do to ensure
economic growth.
   ``If this country is to maintain its leadership role in the world
economy, we need to encourage investment, and, in particular,
investment that is oriented to long-term growth rather than
short-swing speculation,'' said Dennis Ross, acting assistant
secretary of the treasury for tax policy.
   Bush, in a speech Tuesday to insurance agents, defended his plan.
``Let the critics carp,'' he said. ``I'm going to push for this idea
that will stimulate jobs, risk-taking, capital formation. And it's
good for the economy and it is not a special tax break for the
rich.''
   Until 1986, capital gains, which are profits from the sale of
stock, real estate and other property, were taxed at a lower rate
than were wages and other income. The preferential treatment was
ended, along with several other deductions and exclusions, as part
of the price for cutting basic tax rates across the board.
   The Bush administration and lawmakers of both parties say it was
a mistake to repeal the special treatment of capital gains. They
contend such an incentive is necessary to improve the nation's
savings rate.
   Bush has called for a maximum capital-gains tax rate of 15
percent, down from 33 percent, on assets held for more than three
years. He wants single taxpayers with incomes under $10,000 (couples
under $20,000) to pay zero tax on capital gains.
   Critics of the proposal raised three arguments against the
proposal at the Finance Committee hearing:
   _Restoring a special tax rate for capital gains could lead to
unraveling of other key parts of the 1986 tax overhaul.
   _The proposal could cause the public to perceive the tax system
as weighted in favor of the wealthy.
   _Bush's proposal is unlikely to increase revenues over the long
run, despite predictions of the administration. ``There is a very
real danger that the president's proposal would work against our
long-term effort'' to reduce the federal deficit because it could
reduce revenues, said Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the
committee.
   The administration argues that a lower capital-gains rate would
induce so much investment that government tax collections would
increase by $16 billion over five years. The staff of the Joint
Committee on Taxation calculates the proposal would actually reduce
collections by $13 billion during the same period.
   ``Until a taxpayer sells his asset, the rate of tax is zero,''
said Ross. ``Capping the statutory tax rate at 15 percent will cause
many taxpayers, who would otherwise elect a zero tax rate by
retaining their investments, to realize their gains and pay some
tax.''
   Ronald A. Pearlman, who formerly held Ross's position but now is
chief of staff for the Joint Committee on Taxation, said the
administration's projection is not realistic.
   During the seven years ending in 1987, when capital-gains rates
were cut twice and the stock market was rising, taxpayers realized
$1 trillion of capital gains, Pearlman said. For Bush's proposal to
raise revenues permanently, gains would have to surpass $2 trillion
during a five-year period, Pearlman said.

   Adrian Cronauer, the real-life hero of ``Good
Morning, Vietnam,'' neither looks nor behaves like comedian Robin
Williams. In fact, he's a fledgling government bureaucrat whose
baggy eyes and Brillo-gray beard remind some people of Robert H.
Bork.
   Cronauer says he's seen the movie five times. ``Sure, I love
it,'' he says.
   But much of the popular 1987 screen comedy about a fast-talking,
nonconformist, yuk-it-up disc jockey in Saigon, which earned
Williams an Oscar nomination, is pure Hollywood make-believe,
Cronauer says.
   ``Yes, there was somebody named Adrian Cronauer,'' he said
Tuesday during a lunch break from his temporary job at the Federal
Communications Commission.
   ``Yes, I was a disc jockey in Saigon, and I went there from
Greece. Yes, I did teach English in my off-duty time. Yes, I did try
to make it sound more like a stateside station. Yes, I did have
problems with news censorship. Yes, I was in a restaurant shortly
before the Viet Cong hit it. And yes, I did start each program by
yelling, `Good Morning, Vietnam!'''
   The rest is what he delicately calls ``good script crafting.''
   ``Welcome to the real world,'' he says. ``Surprise!''
   After 36 years in radio and television, including a four-year
stint as an Air Force disc jockey, Cronauer entered law school at
the University of Pennsylvania in 1986 with his eyes on a new career
in communications law.
   To ``find out how the sausage is really made'' by a government
regulatory agency, Cronauer, 50, is working as a student intern at
the FCC, doing legal research for Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis.
He expects to get his law degree next January.
   Cronauer chuckles at the disparity between his buttoned-down
lifestyle and his screen image as a rebellious disc jockey who once
bucked the U.S. military establishment in Saigon by playing rock 'n'
roll instead of Lawrence Welk on his Armed Forces Radio morning show
in the mid-1960s.
   ``In many ways I'm a very conservative guy,'' he said. ``A
lifelong, card-carrying Republican can't be that much of an
anti-establishment type.''
   Friends still send Cronauer newspaper clippings with photos of
Bork, the look-alike conservative judge whose Supreme Court
nomination was killed by the Senate. The notes scrawled in the
margin read, ``Hey, does this guy look familiar to you?''
   Cronauer is a Bork defender. And in his frequent lectures on
college campuses, where the movie has made him a celebrity, Cronauer
is critical of U.S. conduct of the Vietnam War.
   ``We never lost the war militarily, we lost it politically,'' he
said. ``If there's any lesson to be learned from Vietnam, if God
forbid we ever get involved in any kind of a conflict again, we'd
better be damned sure we have support on the home front politically,
so we don't just go in to fight it but to win it.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Looks to Wisdom of Yogi Berra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While presidents traditionally have quoted
illustrious predecessors, President Bush has been sprinkling his
speeches with the observations of Winston Churchill, Yogi Berra and
Woody Allen.
   Bush, whose own syntax is sometimes a trifle fractured, seems
most at home quoting Berra, often repeating the baseball luminary's
contention that ``you can observe a lot by just watching.''
   ``That master linguist ... Oh, I love to quote Yogi,'' Bush told
a recent audience of college students.
   The president often injects Berra quotes into his prepared
speeches, much as he did during his presidential campaign _ joking
with audiences about ``pairing off in threes.''
   During his campaign, Bush frequently borrowed Berra's ``it seems
like deja vu all over again,'' and told of how ``no one'' frequents
a particular restaurant any more _ because the lines to get in are
so long.
   President Reagan often quoted former Democratic Presidents
Franklin Roosevelt and John F. Kennedy and authors famous and
not-so-famous.
   Bush seldom quotes literary figures or Democratic presidents.
When it comes to former chief executives, he shows a clear
preference for Republicans Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.
   But most of all, he quotes Churchill _ when he's not quoting
Berra.
   He told the United Negro College Fund: ``As an undergraduate I
came to grasp what Churchill talked about when he said: `Personally,
I am always ready to learn, though I do not always enjoy being
taught.'''
   And, in his budget message to Congress: ``We shall not fail or
falter. We shall not weaken or tire. Give us the tools, and we will
finish the job.''
   Those are among the dozen or so references to Churchill that have
cropped up in recent Bush speeches.
   Sometimes, he alludes to Churchill but doesn't quite get the
whole quote out.
   For instance, in a speech to state legislators in the White House
last week, Bush said: ``As Britain faced an adversary that tested
the courage and character of its people, Winston Churchill vowed
never to surrender.''
   That was it. Then, later in the same speech: ``To paraphrase
Churchill again, we shall not flag or fail.''
   Bush speech writer Robert Grady said the president admired
Churchill and that the late British prime minister ``was such a
gifted speaker'' that many of his phrases fit naturally into the
president's speeches.
   Grady said Bush quotes Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt a lot, because
``they fit in with his agenda:'' Lincoln for the politics of
inclusion and Roosevelt because of his devotion to the environment.
   But Yogi Berra?
   ``He's been quoting Yogi Berra for a long time,'' Brady said.
``He's very much a favorite of the president's.'' The speech writer
suggested that part of it might be Bush's background as captain of
the Yale University baseball team in 1948.
   Usually Bush ad libs his own Berra lines, but sometimes speech
writers put them in for him, Grady said.
   Audiences usually laugh when Bush quotes Berra, but he's had less
luck so far with Woody Allen.
   In a speech to drug enforcement agents in New York last week,
Bush said: ``Perhaps you heard Woody Allen's wry observation:
`Organized crime in America takes in over $40 billion a year and
spends very little on office supplies.'''
   The remark was greeted by silence.
   ``Philosopher that he is,'' Bush added sheepishly.

   First Dog Mildred K. Bush is due to have her pups this week, and
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater says the president expects as many
as eight.
   Want one? Forget it.
   ``Mrs. Bush says the pups are all spoken for. Of course, I think
there are about 8,000 requests in at the moment,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Millie is progressing quite well. The president is watching her
condition,'' Fitzwater said.
   The progress of the presidential pooch has been an item of key
concern for the Bush family in recent days.
   In a speech in New York last week, the president said he had to
rush back to Washington because ``the Senate is still in session and
my dog is pregnant.''
   And, he told an audience earlier this week: ``If I look a little
frantic, our dog is expecting. And if you think I look frantic, you
ought to see the Silver Fox.''
   After some laughter, Bush added by way of elaboration: ``That's
Barbara.''

<HEAD>State Considers Removing US Dependents from Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says the
administration is looking into removing the dependents of U.S.
citizens working in Panama, where Americans have been targets of
harassment.
   Baker made the comments after hearing complaints from Rep.
William Lehman, D-Fla., on Tuesday about difficulties faced by both
U.S. officials in Panama and workers at the Panama Canal.
   ``There is a lot of serious potential there for conflict, for
bloodshed, and for the complete breakdown of the Panama Canal
operation,'' Lehman claimed. ``I don't think the American people are
aware of this crisis in the canal area.''
   Lehman, who chairs the House Appropriations transportation
subcommittee, spoke at a foreign operations subcommittee hearing.
   Last month, the U.S. military command headquarters in Panama said
in a statement that during the first six weeks of this year,
Panama's defense forces have ``stopped, searched, rerouted, detained
or impounded'' more U.S. government vehicles than in the previous
eight months.
   U.S.-Panamanian relations have deteriorated since 1987. Gen.
Manuel Noriega, the country's strongman, is under indictment in
Florida for drug trafficking.
   In recent months, the number of official U.S. personnel from
various government agencies has been scaled back.
   Lehman told Baker of an incident earlier this month when
Panamanian police, who are part of Noriega's defense forces, stopped
nine buses carrying about 100 American school children. The police,
who stopped the buses for about three hours, complained the vehicles
did not have proper license plates.
   Lehman also cited other incidents of harassment directed against
Panamanians who work at the canal, such as with car licenses.
   Lehman asked if the administration has a ``fallback position'' or
policy ``in case chaos breaks out.''
   Baker replied that the administration will take ``whatever steps
necessary'' to protect U.S. citizens and the canal, but added that
U.S.-Panamanian relations will not be normalized until Noriega is
removed from power.
   Asked if the administration was considering removing dependents
from the area, Baker replied, ``That's being looked into.''
   Noting that elections are set in Panama for in May, Baker
commented that Noriega is unpopular with many Panamanians.
   ``I think that there is some reasonable chance that if a
semi-fair election is held, that the opposition could win the
election,'' Baker said, adding, ``But if ... he steals that
election, he'll be even more unpopular.''
   The United States does not recognize the legitimacy of the
Panamanian government. It continues to recognize as the legitimate
authority ousted President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was deposed
last February in a coup led by followers of defense chief Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   The United States has about 10,00 military personnel in Panama to
defend the Panama Canal. Of the about 8,000 employees who work at
the canal, the overwhelming majority are Panamanian.

<HEAD>Senate Official Agrees to Repay Some Travel Expenses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Henry K. Giugni has
agreed to stop approving his own travel expenses, and instead submit
his trip vouchers to the Rules Committee, a spokesman for the
panel's chairman says.
   Giugni accepted the arrangement suggested by Rules Committee
Chairman Wendell Ford, the Kentucky Democrat's spokesman, Phil
Norman, said Tuesday.
   Giugni also agreed to reimburse the Senate for some of his
wide-ranging travel in 1987 and 1988, according to a letter from
Ford to Giugni.
   The amount of Giugni's reimbursement was not clear Tuesday, and
attempts to reach the Senate's second-ranking staff official were
unsuccessful.
   Giugni had offered last week to reimburse any questionable
expenses after news stories revealed he had taken a dozen
taxpayer-financed trips in 1987-88, at least half of them to his
native Hawaii.
   Ford, in a March 8 letter that became public this week, wrote
Giugni, ``I concur in your proposal to reimburse the Senate for a
portion of your travel expenses.''
   Ford said that all of Giugni's claims could be justified ``in a
legal sense,'' but wrote that ``some of them might be questioned and
require additional explanation.''
   ``But your decision avoids any appearance of impropriety,'' Ford
said, in commending Giugni for his decision.
   Giugni said last week that he conducted official business on all
of the trips, mostly to inspect senators' home-state offices. Giugni
said trips that included non-Senate business were only partially
billed to taxpayers.
   Giugni, with a $115 million budget, is the chief Senate
purchasing officer and has authority over the Capitol police force.

<HEAD>Communist Party Releases Attack On Yeltsin Before Election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an apparent attempt to derail the political
comeback of Boris Yeltsin, the Communist Party has released a
transcript of Yeltsin's remarks at a 1987 party meeting that cost
him his job as Moscow party boss.
   The political maverick is a candidate for a seat in a new
national assembly that is to be chosen this month.
   According to a transcript released Tuesday of the fateful
closed-door Central Committee meeting, Yeltsin told the gathering
that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had become the object of
``intolerable'' glorification.
   Yeltsin was named Moscow party chief in December 1985 and a
non-voting Politburo member two months later. He lost those posts as
a result of his remarks at the Oct. 21, 1987 meeting.
   The party said it was publishing a transcript of the meeting in
its new monthly journal, News of the Communist Party Central
Committee, because of requests by workers and party members.
   But a U.S. specialist said the release of 40 pages of scathing
attacks on Yeltsin by Gorbachev and other leaders appeared designed
to hurt the 58-year-old Yeltsin in his bid for political office.
   The transcript showed Yeltsin, now campaigning in the March 26
elections that will choose the membership of a national assembly,
criticized not only Gorbachev, who brought him into the Kremlin
leadership, but Yegor K. Ligachev, a conservative force on the
ruling Politburo.
   Jerry Hough, a political scientist at Duke University and the
Brookings Institution, said in an interview that other motives were
at work.
   ``It's aimed at discrediting Yeltsin,'' said Hough, in Moscow to
attend seminars with American correspondents. He said the transcript
was ``damning'' for Yeltsin because it portrays him as inept just as
he is trying to win a seat in the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   At the Central Committee meeting, Yeltsin said that despite
promises of improvements from Gorbachev's reforms, ``nothing has
changed from the point of view of the style of work of the Central
Committee Secretariat and the style of work of Comrade Ligachev.''
   Yeltsin said that since Gorbachev took power in 1985 and launched
his ``perestroika'' program of social and economic reforms, the
people's mood had risen and fallen ``like a wave.''
   He complained of an ``an increase, as I would put it, of the
glorification of the general secretary by some Politburo members. I
think that right now this is just intolerable.''
   Gorbachev invited comments from the 300-plus Central Committee
members on Yeltsin's speech.
   Ligachev took the floor and called Yeltsin's remarks ``pure
slander'' that were ``absolutely without proof.''
   Speaker after speaker blasted Yeltsin, accusing him of political
immaturity, challenging his assertion the public was disenchanted
with perestroika, and saying living conditions in Moscow had
worsened since he became the capital's party chief.
   After more than three hours of criticism, Yeltsin defended his
claim that Gorbachev was being glorified, but added a clarification:
``I believe that this is from the soul, but all the same, probably
it is not for the general good.''
   Gorbachev then interrupted and suggested Yeltsin was implying a
``personality cult'' had formed around the Kremlin chief _ a
powerful accusation in the Soviet Union, where the term is used to
describe Stalin's dictatorship.
   Gorbachev said Yeltsin implied the Politburo had not learned the
dangers of a personality cult.
   ``Is it not enough for you that only Moscow revolves around your
person? Is it necessary for the Central Committee as well to occupy
itself with you?'' Gorbachev asked. ``Have you reached such heights
of self-admiration and is your opinion of yourself such that you put
your ambitions above those of the party, our affairs?''
   Yeltsin finally said he agreed with the criticism, regretted
speaking, and requested to be relieved of his posts.
   Over the next six months, Yeltsin was removed as Moscow party
chief, from the ruling Politburo and from the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet, or parliament.
   He remains a member of the Central Committee and a first deputy
chairman of the State Building Committee, which gives him the rank
of minister.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Different Racial Mix and More Families Among Homeless</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal survey says the nation is housing
more homeless people than ever, particularly families, but it offers
no estimate of the total number of homeless Americans.
   The Department of Housing and Urban Development study released
Tuesday said spending on homeless shelters has increased more than
fivefold, to more than $1.5 billion annually, since a similar HUD
study in 1984.
   It said the number of shelters and shelter beds had nearly
tripled since then.
   The study was released as President Bush called homelessness a
``national shame,'' and vowed to step up the search for solutions.
He said he was troubled by ``ragged pathetic figures huddled over
steam grates'' near the White House.
   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said the study ``shows that America's
efforts to shelter the homeless are beginning to bear results, and
that it is very much a grass roots campaign, characterized by local
and private intitatives.''
   The HUD study reported a large-scale private effort to aid the
homeless, with nine of every 10 shelters around the nation operated
by private, non-profit groups. Two-thirds of the operating funds
come from local, state and federal governments, it said.
   HUD's findings were based on a survey of a sampling of homeless
shelter managers.
   The department did not offer an estimate of the total homeless
population. In its 1984 study, HUD estimated the figure at 250,000
to 350,000 people, a figure that homeless advocates criticized as
too low.
   The new study estimated there were 5,400 homeless shelters in the
nation in 1988, up from 1,900 in 1984. Total bed capacity was
estimated at 275,000, up from 100,000.
   The study found a two-thirds occupancy rate overall, and placed
the average occupancy per night in homeless shelters at 180,000. The
figure was 70,000 in the earlier study.
   Occupancy rates varied greatly by size, city and type of homeless
shelter, as well as the weather.
   About one-fourth of the shelters were reported full all year
round. Shelters set up primarily to handle families with children
showed the highest average of nights at full capacity _ 259 days a
year.
   Almost half the shelter managers surveyed reported having to turn
away at least one person on an average night because of lack of
space _ although most were referred to other shelters.
   The survey concluded that the types of people staying at homeless
shelters has changed.
   ``While both families and unaccompanied men are increasing among
the sheltered homeless, families are increasing more rapidly,'' it
said. ``Unaccompanied men no longer represent the majority of the
sheltered homeless.''
   The percentage of those sheltered who are members of families was
put at 40 percent, nearly twice the 21 percentage figure in 1984. In
actual numbers, the family members receiving shelter quadrupled over
the past four years to more than 60,000.
   Three-quarters of those were single parents with children. The
remainder was divided equally between couples with children and
couples without children.
   The study said one-fourth of those in the shelters are children.
In big cities, children make up almost one-third of those in
shelters.
   The proportion of unaccompanied women in shelters was unchanged
at 14 percent. But their actual numbers increased 180 percent. The
report said that category included victims of domestic violence and
``so-called `bag ladies.'''
   Shelter populations also changed in racial makeup. In 1984,
nearly three out of five were white, and in 1988 the proportion was
reversed. It found 58 percent on an average night were minorities,
most of whom were black.
   Shelter managers estimated that 33 percent of their clients had
problems with alcoholism, 34 percent with mental illness and 25
percent with drug abuse.
   HUD estimated that 80,000 people contributed 30 million hours of
time a year to the shelters.
   HUD surveyed 205 shelter managers and administrators of voucher
programs for the homeless in 65 cities and towns with populations of
25,000 or more, conducted by telephone, and extrapolated the results
for the entire nation.

   The dollar lost marginal ground against the Japanese
yen Wednesday, while share prices sharply rose on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
171.39 points Tuesday, added another 376.13 points, or 1.19 percent,
to finish trading at 32,100.48, surpassing the 32,000-point level
for the first time since March 3, when it finished at 32,000.10.
   The dollar closed at 129.88 yen, down 0.04 yen from Tuesday's
129.92-yen fihish. The currency opened at 129.80 yen and fluctuated
in a tight 129.75-129.90 yen range.
   Dealers said the dollar opened lower in Tokyo following similar
trends on overseas markets and added that the trading rate was
likely to move only slightly until the release later Wednesday of
U.S. trade figures.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was scheduled to announce American
trade figures for January, and Tokyo dealers said they expected the
figure to narrow from December's deficit.
   In stock dealings, traders said the stability in the dollar-yen
rate prompted the Nikkei rise.
   A government report released late Tuesday that showed a decline
in U.S. retail sales in January also removed investor concern over
inflation and helped the index gain, said Kenji Ishizuka of Daiwa
Securities.

   Food and Drug Administration officials say
intensive testing of imported Chilean fruit will continue until they
are satisfied that produce from the South American country is safe
from poisoning attempts.
   Hundreds of food inspectors are at work in Philadelphia, Miami,
New York and Los Angeles, the ports where fruit from Chile arrives
in the United States, officials said.
   ``Until we know where we are going, it would be pure speculation
to indicate any time frame'' for ending the stepped-up testing
program, said Fred Shank, acting deputy director of the FDA's Center
for Food Safety.
   ``What we are doing is pouring all of our available resources
into looking at the produce that is at the docks at the present
time,'' he said. ``We are also in the process of developing a
program to ensure that the produce is safe for re-entry into the
market,'' he added, but would not elaborate.
   FDA Commissioner Frank Young met with White House aides on
Tuesday and told reporters that U.S. officials will meet ``with
representatives of the Chilean fruit growers, also the government of
Chile, the FDA, FBI, and we'll get a joint strategy. We hope to do
that soon.''
   Traces of cyanide were found in two seedless red grapes tested at
the port in Philadelphia on Sunday, and on Monday the FDA warned
consumers not to eat any Chilean fruit and to throw out any fruit
left in their refrigerator unless they were certain it did not come
from Chile.
   Meanwhile, U.S. and Chilean authorities were trying to determine
the source of the cyanide, which was found after a poisoning threat
was telephoned to the U.S. embassy in the Chilean capital of
Santiago on March 2. The caller, a man speaking in Spanish,
threatened to poison export fruit.
   The FDA began precautionary testing, but four days later
officials investigating the threat said it appeared to be a hoax.
However, on March 8, another call was received by the embassy saying
it was not a hoax, Young said.
   Although there has been no public word on a motive in the case, a
Bush administration source knowledgeable about the investigation
said ``the first message did suggest they were trying to call
attention to the poverty in Chile.'' The source spoke on the
condition of anonymity.
   At FDA's urging, supermarkets moved quickly to remove all Chilean
fruit from their shelves and distributors held produce from the
South American country in warehouses until further testing could be
done. Virtually all grapes sold at this time of year in U.S. markets
are from Chile.
   Canadian officials also urged that Chilean fruit be removed from
stores in Canada. Additionally, news reports in Japan said the
Japanese Embassy in Santiago had received a similar poisoning
threat, and Japanese officials have halted Chilean fruit imports.
   The moves could have a devastating effecton the Chilean economy.
The Chilean Fruit Association said Chile exports about 880 million
pounds of fruit, worth about $900 million, to the United States from
Dec. 1 through April.
   Losses at New York City's Hunt's Point Fresh Produce Market alone
would be in the millions of dollars and could be ``incalculable,''
said Tom Kovacevich, chairman of the New York Produce Trade
Association.
   A Los Angeles produce importer gobbled Chilean grapes at a news
conference Tuesday to dramatize his claim that the fruit is safe and
the government is ruining a booming industry unnecessarily.
   ``I think it's a major, major overreaction,'' Rick Eastes,
general manager of the David Oppenheimer California importer, said
of the FDA advisory. ``An industry worth $750 million in the United
States and Canada has been brought to a standstill. ... We have been
assassinated by insinuation.''
   The levels of cyanide in each of two grapes in which it was
confirmed were very low _ 0.003 milligrams each, said FDA spokesman
Bill Grigg. However, the FDA could not determine how much cyanide
had been originally introduced, since the poison dissipates in the
acidic environment of the fruit, he said.
   A level of 200 milligrams is considered a lethal dosage for an
adult, and 25 milligrams would make an adult sick, he said. An adult
who ate a dozen grapes each containing the level of cyanide found in
the contaminated samples ``probably wouldn't even notice it,'' he
said.
   ``But I wouldn't risk it because one might be spiked a lot higher
than another. We just don't know if the motivation of the people
(who made the threat) was to hurt people or to call attention to a
problem.''

<TEXT>
   The House Armed Services Committee has
overwhelmingly backed a military base closing plan, supporting
Chairman Les Aspin's prediction that the full House will go along.
   The committee voted 43-4 Tuesday to support recommendations of
the independent Commission on Base Realignment and Closure, which
proposed that 145 military facilities either be shut down, have
their operations reduced, or their mission changed.
   Both houses must disapprove the entire list of recommendations to
stop them. The deadline for voting under will be in May, with the
exact date to be determined by the number of days each house is in
session.
   Aspin, D-Wis., said after the commission's recommendation was
released last Dec. 29, ``I fully expect the Congress to support this
package.''
   He said that while two dozen House members' districts were
affected, more than 100 others who feared base closings were ``are
breathing a sigh of relief.''
   ``They now have a vested interest'' in approval of the list,
``because it will give the bases in their areas at least a decade's
breather,'' Aspin said.
   The last batch of closings occurred in 1977.
   Tuesday, Aspin said, ``From the information we've gotten, the
commission has done a reasonable job.'' Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., chairman of the military installations subcommittee, added,
``It does appear a reasonable, prudent commission has reached these
decisions.''
   Voting against the commission were Reps. Jim Courter, R-N.J.;
Larry Hopkins, R-Ky.; Frank McCloskey, D-Ind., and Lane Evans, D-Ill.
   Evans has been upset with the proposed closing of Chanute Air
Force Base in Illinois, while Hopkins _ and others who supported the
commission _ were angry with what they called Pentagon stonewalling
on congressional requests for justification of the proposals.
   Courter said the plan to place Fort Dix, N.J., on a semi-active
status would end its basic training mission without permitting
non-military use of the facility. McCloskey warned of substantial
environmental cleanup costs if the Jefferson Proving Ground in
Indiana is closed.
   The commission said its recommendations could save an estimated
$694 million a year, with 20-year savings estimated at $5.6 billion.
While a number of lawmakers said the savings would disappear because
of environmental cleanup costs, the law establishing the commission
told the panel not to consider such expenses.
   The Pentagon already had been required to clean up hazardous
waste at military installations.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee held a hearing on the
commission plan Tuesday. Former Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci
said, ``The military services did not indicate to me they had a
problem with any part of the recommendation.''
   But Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said the recommendations would result in an
``American tragedy'' for those thrown out of work in places such as
Chanute.
   Dixon said the point system used to decide the fate of Chanute
was based on incorrect assumptions about the base's facilities.
   The commission last Dec. 29 proposed closing 86 facilities,
partially closing five others and changing the mission in 54 other
installations.

<TEXT>
   Three Navy mine sweepers are ending their
tours of duty in the Persian Gulf in the biggest single reduction of
U.S. warships since an Aug. 20 truce ended fighting between Iran and
Iraq.
   The departure of the mine sweepers is expected within the week,
U.S. military sources said.
   The withdrawal would leave the United States with 11 warships _
including three other mine sweepers _ in the gulf, and nine more in
a supporting aircraft carrier battle group in the Arabian Sea.
   U.S. officials say the Navy intends to keep a permanent force in
the gulf, as it has since 1949.
   The latest reported cutback coincides with the arrival of a new
chief for the Joint Task Force Middle East, the naval contingent in
the gulf.
   Rear Adm. William M. Fogarty, who led the official inquiry into
the shooting down of an Iranian jetliner by the Navy cruiser USS
Vincennes on July 3, will take command Thursday.
   Fogarty replaces Rear Adm. Anthony A. Less, who headed the task
force for 13 months when the ``tanker war'' intensified and U.S.
ships and planes clashed several times with Iranian forces.
   Six Iranian vessels, including two heavily armed frigates, were
sunk or disabled on April 18, 1988, after an American missile
frigate was nearly sunk by an Iranian mine. More than 300 commercial
ships were attacked and more than 500 seamen killed in the ``tanker
war.''
   Military sources in Washington said the three departing U.S.
ships were the Inflict, based at Little Creek, Va., the Fearless and
the Illusive, both from Charleston, S.C.

   Regional airlines from Maine to Puerto Rico that
depend on ties to Eastern Airlines are taking a bumpy ride trying to
weather the loss of business caused by the Machinists strike.
   In New Hampshire, a commuter line suspended operations and the
governor of Vermont has asked the federal government for help.
   ``That's what happens when these carriers get in bed with a weak
or poorly run major partner,'' Michael Boyd, an analyst at Regional
Airline Management Systems, said Tuesday from Golden, Colo.
   ``Because of the consolidation of the industry ... if one player
goes down, they take a lot more players down with them than they
used to.''
   Commuter lines hurt by the 1{-week-old Eastern strike go by such
names as Precision Airlines and Eastern Metro Express. They provide
linking flights up and down the East Coast to Maine; Martha's
Vineyard; Philadelphia; Atlanta; Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands,
among other stops.
   Their connection to Eastern is more than simply moving passengers
from a major air route to its less-traveled tributaries. Many of the
commuter and regional lines depend on Eastern to take their
reservations, print their tickets and act as a clearinghouse for
fare money.
   Since the Eastern Machinists union strike began March 4,
triggering walkouts by its pilots and flight attendants, the airline
has reduced the number of its reservation clerks. And because
Eastern filed for federal bankruptcy court protection from creditors
last week, the cash due the commuter lines from its tickets could be
held up for weeks.
   ``When the bankruptcy was filed, those funds got all tangled
up,'' Boyd said. ``When you run a commuter airline, you run pretty
close to the vest.''
   One of the hardest hit was Precision Airlines of Manchester,
N.H., which runs flights out of New Hampshire and Vermont. Last
weekend, Precision suspended all operations for at least three weeks
and furloughed 350 workers, citing a 70 percent drop in passenger
traffic.
   ``This has occurred in spite of a massive public relations
campaign to make the public aware that Precision Airlines was
independently owned and continued to operate its 145 daily
flights,'' the company said in a statement.
   The move prompted Vermont Gov. Madeleine Kunin to ask the Federal
Aviation Administration for help in restoring air service.
   In Maine, Bangor-based Bar Harbor Airways Inc. had been relying
on the reservation system and connecting flights of Eastern and
faced a possible 30 percent decline in its passengers due to the
strike.
   But because Bar Harbor is owned by Texas Air Corp., parent
company of Eastern and Continental Airlines, it was able to recover
some of the business it lost from Eastern by diverting all its
resources to the Continental system, according to Steven Mason, Bar
Harbor's marketing director.
   ``When the strike began and pilots did not cross (picket lines)
the first effect was, we immediately began to miss connecting
traffic,'' Mason said. ``The ability to expand on the Continental
Express (commuter) service did come as a relief.''
   The impact has been similar further south. Within days of the
strike, Eastern had canceled its Atlanta runs.
   ``We were hurt substantially by the Eastern strike,'' said Robert
E. Phillips, president of Eastern Metro Express in Atlanta, a
subsidiary of one of the country's biggest regional carriers, Metro
Airlines.
   ``Our mission in life is to serve the connecting traffic to and
from Atlanta for Eastern.''
   This week, the airline temporarily dropped connector service to
seven Southeastern cities and began flying Eastern's unused routes
instead to capture local business traffic, Phillips said.
   Eastern Metro Express' Caribbean service, based in San Juan,
Puerto Rico, felt only a slight impact because Eastern provides a
small percentage of its passenger base.

<HEAD>US Fruit Imports High, Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The discovery of poisoned grapes from Chile has
raised questions among government and industry analysts about the
potential impact on the growth of fruit and vegetable imports.
   About 30 percent of the fruit and vegetables eaten by Americans
are imported.
   The Agriculture Department said Tuesday that grape imports from
Chile grew to about 260,000 tons in 1988 from 213,000 in 1987.
   Just 10 years ago, in 1979, only 33,000 tons of Chilean grapes
were imported, the department said.
   Removal of Chilean grapes and other fruit from American food
stores following discovery of two grapes bearing traces of cyanide
is bound to be felt in the food industry but the extent of damage is
hard to determine, said John McClung of the United Fruit and
Vegetable Association, a trade group.
   ``We don't know how long this is going to go on,' McClung said.
``It's too soon to tell the economic impact, but the potential is
considerable, both in Chile and the United States.''
   McClung said Americans annually import about 30 percent of the
fruit and vegetables they consume, most of it in the form of fresh
produce, such as bananas, grapes, apples and tomatoes.
   ``Chile is the big supplier of fruit,'' McClung said. ``In
vegetables, it's mainly Mexico.''
   The Agriculture Department says U.S. fresh fruit imports alone
reached almost 3.62 million metric tons in 1987, up about 2 percent
from 3.56 million tons in 1986. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds.
   Bananas made up 81 percent of the 1987 fresh fruit imports,
followed by grapes with 6.9 percent and apples with 3.7 percent.
   The bananas came mostly from Ecuador, Colombia and the so-called
Caribbean Basin Initiative countries of Honduras, Costa Rica,
Panama, Guatemala and the Bahamas. Grapes mostly were from Chile,
and apples from Canada, Chile and New Zealand.
   A 1983 law gave 27 countries in the Caribbean Basin duty free
access to U.S. markets for 12 years.
   Chile has passed South Africa, Australia and Argentina to become
the leading supplier of fresh fruit to North America and Europe
during the Northern Hemisphere's winter months.
   About 75 percent of Chile's grapes are shipped to the United
States, and a large percentage of its apples go to Europe. But some
apples also go to the United States where they compete with the
domestic crop. Pears are another major Chilean item for the U.S.
market, according to USDA analysts.
   ``Chile has a climate somewhat like ours,'' McClung said in an
interview. ``It's not a tropical climate, so they're able to produce
stone fruit like peaches, nectarines, plums, that kind of fruit. And
those are popular in this country.''
   McClung said the trade was stunned by what happened to the
Chilean grapes and was at a loss to speculate on what may happen
next.
   ``Honestly, I'm unaware of anything like this from any place,
ever,'' he said. ``But I suppose if someone is intent on a criminal
or terrorist act regarding the tainting of produce, it can probably
be accomplished.''
   At the USDA, analyst Ben W. Huang of the department's Economic
Research Service said it was too early to say what impact the
incident may have on U.S. food supplies.
   John J. VanSickle of the University of Florida said in a report
just issued by the USDA that Florida vegetable growers are concerned
about competition from the Caribbean Initiative countries.
   ``Florida and Mexico have long battled for supremacy in the
winter fresh vegetable industry,'' he said.
   VanSickle said Florida's share of the winter vegetable market has
grown only in tomatoes, rising to 51.9 percent of U.S. consumption
in 1986-87 from 42.4 percent in 1975-76.
   ``Florida's share of the eggplant market remained fairly stable,
while the share of all other commodities fell, with bell peppers,
cucumbers, beans and squash each falling between 10 percent and 19.8
percent,'' he said.
   Even so, Florida's actual production of these vegetables has
increased, with the exception of beans, VanSickle said. The decline
in the shares of the U.S. market shows the tremendous growth that
has taken place in consumption.
   Another USDA report said the 1988 drought did not affect consumer
prices of fresh vegetables this winter, noting that most are grown
under irrigation in Florida or California.
   ``Many winter fresh tomatoes, peppers, green beans, cucumbers,
squash and eggplant are imported from Mexico,'' the report said.
   But U.S. apple production dropped 17 percent last year, partly
because of the drought, and retail prices are up this winter, the
report said. Production in Washington, the leading apple state, fell
26 percent from 1987.
   ``Winter supplies of fresh soft fruits, such as peaches, grapes,
apricots, plums and nectarines are imported from Southern Hemisphere
countries, mostly Chile,'' the report noted.

   Saturday night was the loneliest night of
the week for 17-year-old Stacy Powell, and a frantic one for her
mother.
   Stacy stopped by Hardee Senior High in the community 50 miles
southeast of Tampa on Saturday afternoon to use the telephone, and
ended up getting locked in the bathroom after a teacher locked the
restroom without checking to see if it was empty.
   When she did not return home by midnight, her family notified the
Hardee County Sheriff's Office, which issued a missing person
bulletin.
   Meanwhile, Stacy's screams for help went unheard and she settled
in for the night on the cold tile floor of the bathroom. She was
rescued Sunday morning, when a volunteer putting up missing person
posters about her disapperance heard Stacy's screams for help.
   Stacy said she was excited because she knew her parents were
worried about her.
   ``It was the worst thing I've ever been through,'' said her
mother, Bonnie.

<HEAD>30,000 March in Estonia to Demand End to `Bourgeois' Nationalism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   At least 30,000 Russians and other non-Estonians
marched in the Baltic republic's capital of Tallinn, threatening a
general strike if the Communist Party does not halt a surge of
nationalist reform, journalists said.
   Tuesday's protest was organized by Interfront, a group dominated
by ethnic Russians that claims the 420,000 ethnic Russians in the
republic are discriminated against by the ethnic Estonian majority.
   Estonia's parliament, using the greater autonomy granted local
lawmakers under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, voted Jan. 18 to
require non-Estonians who work in jobs where they come into contact
with the public to learn Estonian in four years or face dismissal.
   Interfront wants Russian to be granted the status of an official
state language in Estonia, on par with Estonian.
   In the Estonian Communist Party's daily newspaper Sovietskaya
Estonia, the group had called for people to demonstrate ``against
creeping counterrevolution undermining socialism in Estonia and in
the Baltic region of the U.S.S.R.''
   Ethnic Estonians make up 65 percent of the republic's 1.5 million
inhabitants, with ethnic Russians totaling 28 percent.
   Maarika Saarna, a reporter with state Estonian radio, estimated
30,000 demonstrators marched. Police said 50,000 people turned out.
   Finnish radio said from Tasllinn that Interfront guaranteed a
large turnout in Tuesday's demonstration by starting the march
directly from factories during working hours.
   Workers had no choice but to follow their leaders, the radio said.
   Speaking by telephone from Tallinn, Ms. Saarna said
Russian-language schools in Tallinn were given the day off, and
non-Estonian residents of the Baltic republic's northeast were
brought in to the capital to swell the number of marchers.
   At a rally held later outside city hall, speakers demanded an
emergency meeting in April of the Estonian party's policy-making
Central Committee to halt ``bourgeois nationalism'' and
``counterrevolution,'' Ms. Saarna said.
   Speakers also objected to the decision of Estonia's party and
government to fly the Baltic state's old flag, which had long been
illegal under Soviet rule, from the highest medieval castle tower in
Tallinn, she said.
   The blue, black and white standard was hoisted at Gherman Tower
on Feb. 24, 71 years after Estonia declared its independence.
Estonia, like its neighbors Latvia and Lithuania, was forcibly
absorbed by the Kremlin in 1940.
   The flag remains a powerful symbol of its short-lived
independence.
   Ms. Saarna said Interfront members warned that if they did not
hear within two weeks that their demands had been met they would
stage a two-hour strike on April 3 and a daylong work stoppage a
week later.

<HEAD>Proposal to Ease Rules on Toxic Waste Disposal Draws Public Ire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nuclear industry and many health scientists
strongly favor a proposal to end federal controls on some low-level
radioactive waste, but government records show much of the general
public is alarmed at the prospect.
   ``I don't want to die of cancer because you allowed somebody to
dump low-level waste near my home, school or water source,'' Lisa
Brown, of Corvallis, Ore., wrote in a recent letter to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission.
   The Environmental Protection Agency also has stated its
opposition to the NRC plan.
   The commission is evaluating the hundreds of written responses it
has received to a proposal published last December to end regulation
of wastes _ from nuclear plants, medical research, recycled metals
and consumer products _ which emit radiation at levels so low as to
be deemed acceptable risks to public health.
   The commission proposed setting the limit at 10 millirems per
year per person. By comparison, radiation from a single X-ray is
about 30 millirems, and the average American is exposed to between
200 millirems and 300 millirems a year from natural background
radiation, not counting X-rays.
   In its proposal, the NRC said ``there is no clear consensus,''
based on existing scientific data, on exactly what level of
radiation exposure should be considered an acceptable risk. Congress
in 1985 instructed the NRC to set such a limit.
   The commission said the risk of cancer death associated with
exposure to 10 millirems per year is two in 1 million. A level of
risk even five times greater than this would be of ``little concern
to most members of society,'' it said.
   Of those writing to express a view on the proposal, nuclear
utilities and scientists were uniformly in favor, although some
disagreed on the exact level of acceptable exposure.
   John J. Kearney, writing on behalf of the health physics
committee of the Edison Electric Institute, proposed a dose limit of
as high as 20 millirems per year.
   ``The associated risks, if any, are quite small compared to other
actual risks an individual faces every day,'' he wrote. His group is
an electric utility trade group.
   Many private individuals, however, said they were troubled at the
prospect of allowing producers of toxic wastes to dispose of it
without federal controls.
   ``It is beyond belief that instead of being more vigilant with
protecting us from radioactive poison you are pursuing a policy to
allow more radioactive materials to enter our soil and water,''
Dolores M. Moran of Avon Lake, Ohio, wrote.
   ``We certainly cannot look to the waste generators to regulate
themselves,'' wrote Linda Dangelo of Lincoln, Neb.
   The EPA, in a letter signed by Richard E. Sanderson, director of
the Office of Federal Activities, said it was troubled by several
aspects of the proposal, including doubts about safety and
compatibility with EPA's waste-control authority.
   ``We do not believe the policy would adequately protect public
health and the quality of man's environment,'' the EPA letter said.
   Many environmental groups have strongly criticized the proposal.
The Public Citizen group founded by Ralph Nader has accused the NRC
of bowing to nuclear industry pressure to help reduce the cost of
disposing of radioactive wastes. It contends the measure, if
adopted, would cut those costs by $1 billion over 20 years.
   ``Notwithstanding that there is no safe level of radiation
exposure, this policy would allow nuclear waste to be disposed of in
your local garbage dump like banana peels and coffee grounds,'' said
Scott Saleska, a Public Citizen nuclear waste specialist.
   Although the majority of letters received by the NRC from private
individuals expressed opposition to the proposal, some others said
safety concerns were overblown.
   ``I feel society has an unhealthy obsession about zero risk,''
wrote Michael A. Ruhe of Charlotte, N.C.

   Toxic chemicals blown from distant sites are
disrupting the life cycle of birds on the Great Lakes, and the
plight of the water fowl has worsened dramatically in recent years,
according to research released by environmentalists.
   ``In a broad sense, these chemicals are eliminating the diversity
in the Great Lakes,'' said James P. Ludwig, a consulting ecologist
from Bay City, Mich., at a news conference Tuesday. ``We have a few
species, but the elegance is gone.''
   Ludwig surveyed thousands of bird eggs and hatchlings in the
northern lakes and found sharp increases in deformities such as
malformed hips, club feet, eye abnormalities and body organs
attached outside the birds at birth.
   To demonstrate the effects of pollution, the researchers
displayed at the news conference a live cormorant with a twisted
beak. The bird, which was found on Naubinway Island, Mich., in
northern Lake Michigan, may eventually be placed in a petting zoo.
   A 1986-88 survey of water bird eggs in the upper Great Lakes
region found deformities in Caspian terns occurring 31 times more
frequently than in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Ludwig said.
   Even low levels of contamination produced effects in the Great
Lakes food chain, Ludwig said.
   His research included birds nesting in highly contaminated areas,
such as Saginaw Bay in eastern Michigan.
   Many contaminants are blown into the lakes from many hundreds of
miles away, an ecologist said in describing research last year on
Isle Royal, Mich., an island in Lake Superior.
   Deborah Swackhammer, an ecologist with the University of
Minnesota, studied fish in Siskiwit Lake on the island and found
concentrations of the toxic chemical polychlorinated biphenyl.
   The PCB could only have reached the lake from the air, since the
lake's level is above that of surrounding Lake Superior, she said.
   ``Not only is every fish in the Great Lakes contaminated by
chemicals to some extent, but anything that consumes those fish is
also contaminated to some extent,'' including people, she said.
   The research was released as part of a lobbying effort by the
Sierra Club.

<TEXT>
   An arm of the Department of Health and Human
Services is warning local AIDS programs they could lose federal
money if they support needle-exchange programs, even though the head
of HHS has more recently endorsed such programs.
   The warning was contained in a memo from the National Institute
of Drug Abuse. The memo went out about two weeks before HHS
Secretary Louis Sullivan endorsed local programs that let drug
addicts trade their used needles for clean ones to stem the spread
of AIDS.
   Sullivan, whose department includes the Public Health Service,
which oversees the institute, also said the federal government could
provide information and personnel to such programs.
   But Public Health Service spokesman James Brown denied a conflict
between the memo and Sullivan's comments. He said the policies of
both the service and the White House prohibit use of federal funds
for needle-exchange programs, but if that policy were changed, the
department could provide such federal support.
   ``You could do it, which is what Sullivan said,'' Brown said.
``We're not doing it and NIDA (the institute) is telling people
we're not going to do it.''
   Asked about the policies, Sullivan's spokesman, Campbell Gardett,
said: ``We're in an in-between period when an awful lot has to be
worked out. ... It's a controversial enough thing that it's
eventually going to come down to Bush.''
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters Friday: ``The
president is opposed to exchangeable needles under any condition.''
   Sullivan, in an interview with the AP two days before that, said
he did not ``subscribe to the view'' that clean-needle programs
condone drug abuse. Of such programs, he said, ``We would be very
supportive of such efforts'' in communities that want such programs.
   The Feb. 19 institute memo, obtained by The Associated Press,
told 41 institute-funded AIDS programs that Public Health Service
policy prohibits ``any kind of federal support'' for programs that
distribute clean needles to addicts to help stop the spread of the
deadly virus.
   The author of the memo, Barry S. Brown, chief of community
research at the institute, told the 41 affected programs that
federal aid would be denied to anyone ``who is engaged in, or who
supports'' needle-exchange programs.
   In part, the memo said:
   ``It should be clearly understood by all NIDA (institute)
grantees and contractors that it is against NIDA and Public Health
Service (PHS) policy to provide any kind of federal support to
programs involving the making available of new or cleaned needles or
providing a needle exchange program. Anyone receiving NIDA funds who
is engaged in, or who supports, activity prohibited by the PHS will
face prompt action to suspend that program's funding.''
   Brown said that he had written the memo after someone running one
of the projects raised the needle-exchange issue and that he had
subsequently gotten ``a couple'' of calls about his directive.
   Brown said that after he explained to the callers that the
support referred to in the memo was federal financial aid, ``they
went away satisfied.''
   Billi Odegaard, director of the Multnomah County Health Division,
which serves Portland, Ore., and is receiving about $1 million in
institute funds this year for its AIDS project, said the memo at
first ``sounded extreme.''
   But she said Brown explained to one of her colleagues that
``we're OK under that policy as long as we're not directly
operating'' a needle-exchange program.
   Still, officials of a Portland community group, Outside In, are
concerned the directive could hamper their efforts to start a
needle-exchange program, which they had hoped to coordinate with the
Multnomah project.
   ``We're worried about whether they can continue to be supportive
and to what degree,'' said Kathy Oliver, director of Outside In.
   Brown, the research chief, said an institute-funded program could
subcontract with a needle-exchange program as long as the federal
funds weren't mixed with the needle-exchange money. He also said
that while someone paid from institute funds could not spend their
federally-paid time coordinating or advising a needle-exchange
program, they could do so ``on his or her own time.''
   It is unclear how much discretion Sullivan has in changing policy
within his department.
   Congress last year passed legislation that prevents certain
federal funds from being used on needle-exchange programs. Another
law passed last year gives the surgeon general authority to use
federal funds on a demonstration needle-exchange project.
   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who runs the Public Health
Service, has said he supports needle-exchange trials to study how
effective such programs could be. However, he hasn't proposed a
federal program.

<HEAD>Court Orders Compensation For Noisy U.S. Navy Flights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge today ordered the government to pay an
estimated $3 million to residents who complained that noisy flights
by U.S. military planes kept them awake at night.
   The decision came almost seven years after 599 residents filed
the suit seeking $23 million in compensation and a ban on night
flights by the U.S. Air Force.
   Residents said the sound of jets taking off and landing at Yokota
Air Base west of Tokyo had caused chronic sleeplessness and hearing
problems.
   Tokyo District Judge Takeshi Ochiai ruled that the noise levels
``exceeded acceptable levels'' and ordered the government to pay
each resident living near the base between about $18 and $11,000
each, depending on the degree of noise pollution.
   But Ochiai refused to grant the residents' demand to ban the
flights between 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
   He said he could not order the government to halt the flights
because Yokota Base is under the jurisdiction of the U.S. military.
The court also dismissed the residents' demand for future
compensation for potential damages.
   Kyodo News Service said plaintiffs' attorneys estimated the total
compensation from the government to be about $3 million.
   Under a U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty, Japan provides land
and pays some of the costs for U.S. troops stationed in the country.
   Residents living near Yokota Air Base filed two earlier damage
suits for noise pollution in 1976 and 1977. One case, with 41
plaintiffs, is under appeal to the Supreme Court.
   In that case and another involving 107 plaintiffs, the Tokyo High
Court rejected requests for a ban on nighttime flights, but awarded
damages to the plaintiffs.
   The court ruled that national defense takes precedence over other
fields of administration in promoting the public interest, even in
peacetime, and that therefore citizens should endure inconveniences
caused by military facilities.

   A record $10.7 billion in deposit withdrawals
from savings and loan institutions underscores the industry's
increasing vulnerability to rising interest rates, analysts say.
   ``It means basically 1989 is going to be a lousy year unless we
see a dramatic downturn in short-term interest rates,'' said Bert
Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial institutions consultant.
   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported Tuesday that 80 percent
of the nation's 2,945 S&amp;Ls experienced net withdrawals in January.
The total, in one month, exceeded net withdrawals for all of 1988,
which were $8.6 billion.
   James Barth, the bank board's chief economist, said a preliminary
estimate shows withdrawals easing only slightly in February to
between $8 billion and $9 billion.
   Barth attributed the bulk of the withdrawals to the failure of
S&amp;Ls to keep pace with rising interest rates offered by competitors,
principally money market mutual funds, which in January paid
interest 1.25 percentage points higher than S&amp;L three-month
certificates of deposit.
   Ely said much of the S&amp;L deposit runoff has been voluntary in the
sense that thrift institutions could raise interest rates and draw
in more money. But, sooner or later, S&amp;Ls will be forced to offer
higher interest rates and as that happens, S&amp;Ls losses, which last
year were the worst since the Great Depression, will deepen, he said.
   ``The industry is going to suffer in the same way it did in the
early 1980s (when interest rates soared above 20 percent) but not in
the same magnitude,'' he said.
   The problem is that S&amp;Ls are forced to increase the rates paid on
deposits faster than rates earned on loans.
   Economist Paul Getman of The Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
forecasting firm, said S&amp;Ls have been unable to raise deposit rates
because ``there is a fierce rate war going on in mortgage lending.''
   ``Thrifts are pricing adjustable rate mortgages at near suicidal
levels. If they start raising deposit rates, they're going to have
to raise mortgage rates ... and risk losing business. There's no
easy way out,'' he said.
   Barth attributed another portion of the withdrawals to a
deliberate strategy by regulators to shrink ailing institutions.
However, he also acknowledged that some of the outflows were caused
by confidence problems as publicity mounted about the condition of
the industry.
   In February, for instance, $1.3 billion of the withdrawals
occurred at the 230 institutions targeted for immediate government
takeover under President Bush's plan for resolving the S&amp;L crisis,
he said.
   In the weeks preceding announcement of the Bush plan on Feb. 6,
news accounts focused on an administration trial balloon suggesting
that depositors would be asked to pay a fee to help bail out the S&amp;L
deposit insurance fund.
   ``That sort of talk undoubtedly induced some people to believe,
`Why keep deposits at thrifts?''' Barth said.
   February marks the 10th consecutive month of outflows from S&amp;Ls
and the fourth month in a row of outflows in excess of $7 billion.
They totaled $8.3 billion in December and $7.0 billion in November.
From May through October, outflows totaled $9.4 billion.
   That was offset by $16.2 billion in inflows during the first four
months of 1988 when investors pulled their money out of the volatile
stock market and put it into federally insured institutions.
   ``Through (most of) last year they lost deposits and they're
going to lose deposits all through this year. That's not a sign of
confidence as far as I'm concerned,'' Getman said.

<HEAD>Health Expert's Ridicule of `Toxic Bogeyman' Fails to Calm Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schools across the country are banning apples
from lunchrooms even as one health expert mocks educators' fears of
the farm chemical Alar as a ``toxic bogeyman.''
   On Tuesday, school systems in Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and
in Virginia joined districts in New York City, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Sacramento, Cincinnati, Atlanta and elsewhere in
suspending sales of apples, applesauce and apple juice. The bans
follow a report that children faced increased cancer risks from the
chemical that's used to make some apples crisper and brighter.
   Seeking to slow the spread of apple bans and soothe consumer
alarm, California's top health officer said educators were acting
hastily.
   Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Department of Health
Services, pulled out a shiny red apple and took a bite as he
explained that current research on Alar, a trade name for the
compound daminozide, shouldn't prompt anybody to quit eating the
fruit.
   ``In a nutshell, I and the Department of Health Services think
this was reactionary and premature and indeed our fear is they have
really created a toxic bogeyman,'' Kizer said.
   The bans were prompted by a report last month from the
Washington, D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council, which
estimated that the average preschooler's cancer risk was about one
case for every 4,000 preschoolers exposed to UDMH, a breakdown
product of Alar. It found the risk greatest for children because of
the large amounts of apple products they consume.
   Farm groups maintain little threat from the chemical exists, and
the manufacturer, Uniroyal Chemical Co. of Middlebury, Conn.,
estimates it is used on only 5 percent of the nation's apple crop.
The federal Environmental Protection Agency plans to ban the use of
Alar on food crops in 18 months, pending further study.
   Public lobbying against Alar by actress Meryl Streep and a
broadcast on the CBS-TV program ``60 Minutes'' have fueled the
growing concern.
   Kizer said the risk of getting cancer from agricultural chemicals
is dwarfed by the cancer threat posed by a bad diet overloaded with
sugar and fat.
   ``This should not change what parents are putting in their kids'
lunch or what schools are serving the kids,'' Kizer said of the
controversy. ``When we send a message to our kids that apples aren't
safe, what are they going to eat? They're going to eat Twinkies and
Zingers.''
   Vicky Scharlau, a spokeswoman for the Washington (state) Apple
Commission, which represents the nation's largest apple crop, said
it was frustrating that school districts were choosing to disregard
EPA assurances that apples are safe.
   ``They are taking the issue into their own hands and playing
judge and jury,'' she said. ``They are instilling fear in children
whose favorite products are apples and apple products.''
   Chicago officials said the ban was temporary, pending suppliers'
assurances that the products were free of Alar.
   In Virginia, bans were announced by school officials in Fairfax
County outside Washington, D.C, and in Richmond.
   The federal government's school lunch program will continue
providing apples, applesauce and apple slices to students, said Gene
Vincent, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   ``Our apples are certified Alar-free,'' Vincent said.
   A cyanide scare involving Chilean fruit may divert consumer
attention away from apples, but won't solve the industry's problems,
said Derl Derr, president of the International Apple Institute in
McLean, Va.
   Washington state provides about two-thirds of the nation's
supermarket apples this time of year, and the state's 5,000 growers
produce more than $310 million worth of apples per year.
   Ron Myers, a Wenatchee, Wash., apple grower and member of the
Washington Apple Commission, said the grower-financed commission
planned to decide at its annual meeting today whether to spend part
of a $1.6 million emergency fund on advertising to reassure
consumers that apples are safe.
   Tree Top Inc., the world's largest apple juice processor, also
plans an advertising campaign in Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles
and in USA Today this week, said spokesman John McAlister.
   Daminozide is used most commonly on apples but also on other
fruit and on flowers. It prevents apples from dropping or being
blown from trees before they ripen, brings out the color in some
varieties and has other benefits.
   Varieties most commonly treated are MacIntosh, red delicious,
golden delicious, and Jonathan. Granny Smith, Pippin and other green
apples generally aren't treated.

<HEAD>Mexico Said To Be Turning Back Trucks Of Live Hogs At Border</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexican authorities are turning away truckloads
of live hogs from north of the border because they have not been
vaccinated for hog cholera, which has been eradicated from this
country for more than a decade, officials say.
   Calling the action an artificial trade barrier, Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas is asking U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills and
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter to negotiate a halt.
   A spokeswoman for Hills says the office is looking into the
situation after being contacted Tuesday by Bentsen. Bentsen's office
said Mexico began turning away the U.S. hogs on Friday.
   Pat El-Hinnaway, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department's
Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, said Tuesday the agency
just received official notification from Mexico about the ban. ``We
are in the process of translating it and analyzing it,'' El-Hinnaway
said.
   Bentsen said Mexico is barring the hog imports because the
animals have not been vaccinated for hog cholera, which has long
been eradicated from the United States.
   ``In fact, it is illegal under U.S. law to vaccinate hogs against
hog cholera, and since the hogs in question are market hogs destined
for slaughter, such a vaccination would be moot in any case,'' said
Bentsen.
   Richard Pasco, director of legislative and regulatory affairs for
the National Pork Producers Council, said he believes that a
solution can be worked out.
   ``Our hogs do not have hog cholera,'' Pasco said. ``It seems
pretty obvious we have a reasonable argument here. I'm not real
pessimistic right now.''
   In the meantime, he said ``it's a real physical problem,'' with
truckers carrying live hogs looking for new markets or debating
whether to wait it out and hoping they can soon take their loads
into Mexico, which last year imported 83,000 hogs.
   Bentsen's office said the three most common ports of entry into
Mexico from Texas for hogs are Del Rio, Laredo and Eagle Pass.
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture said Mexico imported $11.5
million in live market and breeder hogs in 1988, with most of the
imports occuring in the last seven months of the year. Before last
June, Mexico had a ``prohibitive'' 10 percent tariff on hog imports,
Bentsen's office said.
   In 1987, under the 10 percent tariff, Mexico imported only
$650,000 in U.S. hogs. This year's imports were expected to exceed
$11.5 million if they had continued at the current rate, Bentsen's
office said.
   The National Pork Producers Council said Mexico imported $9.5
million in live hogs from the United States last year, excluding
breeders, Bentsen's office said.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is fine-tuning its
proposal for non-military aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels amid
confusion between the White House and State Department over how much
to request from Congress.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that
reports President Bush is preparing to ask Congress to approve aid
in the $40 million to $50 million range are ``in the ballpark.''
   But Secretary of State James A. Baker III told a congressional
subcommittee that was ``not an accurate number as far as I'm
concerned.'' Testifying before before the House Appropriations
foreign operations subcommittee, Baker didn't say whether the figure
was too high or too low.
   Told about the discrepancy, Fitzwater said he agreed with Baker
and that when he talked about ballpark figures, ``It's a big
ballpark.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., one of Capitol Hill's most
ardent Contra supporters, will introduce legislation this week to
give the Contras $75 million in new humanitarian aid when the
current aid package runs out March 31, according to a congressional
source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Helms plan would allow for purchase of such items as
gasoline, which are banned under the current aid setup because they
could have a potentially military use.
   Helms also will seek a sense-of-the Congress resolution that
resumption of military aid for the contras should be considered
after one year unless President Bush determines Nicaragua has lived
up to its promises to implement democratic reforms, the source said.
   Bush administration officials have said they are not seeking
miliitary aid, and Fitzwater reiterated Tuesday that the goal is a
diplomatic solution to the eight-year-old internal war in Nicaragua.
   Fitzwater said no final decision has been made on what will Bush
will propose in the way of new humanitarian aid, ``and we are not
setting artificial timetables for decisions.''
   Contra leader Adolfo Calero said administration officials told
him Bush would seek in the neighborhood of $40 million to keep the
Contras alive in their camps on the Honduran side of the Nicaragua
border where some 11,000 rebels are encamped.
   U.S. sources have said the request probably will exceed $50
million.
   Fitzwater said Bush's plan would include ``the ideas of
incentives and disincentives'' to accompany the humanitarian aid and
diplomacy efforts.
   ``In this approach we are also pursuing the building of a
bipartisan support for whatever policy emerges,'' he said.
   Administration officials have said Baker is considering various
economic and diplomatic incentives toward Nicaragua if the ruling
Sandinistas live up to their promises for democratic reform.
   Fitzwater also acknowledged that the cooperation of Honduras in
allowing the Contras to keep their camps on the border is a key
factor.
   He noted that Undersecretary of State Robert Kimmitt visited
Honduran President Jose Azcona on Monday and discussed with him the
matter of incentives, Sandinista compliance with democratization
pledges, and the agreement by the five Central American nations to
reach agreement on disbanding the Contras.
   Baker said the effort to maintain the anti-Sandinista Contras
afloat represents ``a genuine view that they do represent somewhat
of an incentive for the Sandinista government to keep the promises
they haven't kept in the past,'' including steps toward
democratization and civil liberties.
   The five Central American presidents agreed last month in El
Salvador to devise a plan by this spring for the disbanding of the
rebels in exchange for democratic reforms in Nicaragua.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Extends Inquiry Into Fauntroy While Ethics Order is Questioned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is giving the
Justice Department 60 more days to determine whether a special
prosecutor is needed to investigate payroll padding allegations
against House member Walter Fauntroy.
   The move by Thornburgh gives his department more time to assess
allegations against Fauntroy and buys time to deal with a ticklish
political question posed by the independent counsel order issued
last summer by then-Attorney General Edwin Meese III.
   On Tuesday, Thornburgh amended the order that was issued as
Meese's last official act on his last day in office.
   Meese, who himself was twice investigated by court-appointed
independent counsels, issued a regulation expanding the reach of the
independent counsel statute from members of the executive branch to
members of Congress.
   Thornburgh gave himself the option of extending for another 60
days the 90-day preliminary inquiry provided in Meese's order for
determining if evidence warranted appointment of an independent
counsel.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said Thornburgh issued
the order to give the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section
more time to complete the inquiry into Fauntroy, a Democrat who is
the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate.
   The department has been investigating allegations that Fauntroy
hired the son of Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., and paid him $21,398 even
though the younger Savage was living in Chicago instead of
Washington.
   Savage was on Fauntroy's payroll between September 1987 and June
1988, a period during which he swore he was living in Chicago
because he was running for the Illinois legislature.
   The department opened its 90-day inquiry after a report by The
Associated Press about the employment arrangement.
   After taking office, Thornburgh expressed doubts about the Meese
order. Thornburgh said that the public integrity section, created
when he was head of the Criminal Division in the mid-1970s, was
capable of investigating corruption allegations against members of
Congress.
   Thornburgh, however, faced a storm of criticism from Meese
loyalists and conservative Republicans in the House who are anxious
to use the special prosecutor issue to embarrass House Speaker Jim
Wright, D-Texas, the subject of an internal ethics probe.
   The law has been criticized, notably by people who have been
prosecuted under it, as unfairly applying only to executive branch
officials and not members of Congress.
   After threatening to rescind the order, Thornburgh said he would
study the issue. Since then, the issue has been reviewed at the
White House and in the Justice Department.
   The attorney general recently asked the President's Commission on
Federal Ethics Law Reform to study the issue. The panel, which
issued its recommendations last week, said members of Congress
should be subject to the independent counsel provisions as well as
executive branch officials.
   Had Thornburgh wished, the Fauntroy case would have provided the
attorney general with a perfect opportunity to scuttle Meese's
order, according to Justice Department sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Assistant Attoney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. and other
officials have voiced objections to the regulation, which bars the
department from subpoenaing documents or testimony during the
preliminary investigation, sources said.
   The sources say there is uneasiness with the Meese regulation
because it could hobble a criminal investigation of a member of
Congress.
   After the preliminary inquiry is completed, according to the
regulation, the attorney general has the choice of closing the
investigation or appointing an independent counsel to purse a
full-scale criminal probe.
   The independent counsel would be empowered to impanel a grand
jury.
   ``Given this administration's recognition and the attorney
general's recognition that the appearance of fairness and of ethical
conduct is important... I would have hoped that the attorney general
would have been more careful to avoid the appearance of an
eleventh-hour change in the rules of the game,'' said Laurence
Tribe, a Harvard University law professor who is an avid defender of
the independent counsel law.

   The San Francisco Council of Churches has
gone broke, officials said.
   ``As of today, the council is defunct,'' the Rev. Norman Leach,
executive director of the organization, said as he cleaned out his
desk Tuesday.
   The organization has a $2 million annual budget, but faces a
$200,000 deficit, said Leach.
   The council's five staff members were told March 9 they were
being laid off, according to Leach, who blamed the organization's
financial problems on its board's ``lack of expertise.''
   ``They are good and sincere Christians, but they don't know how
to run a business,'' he said.
   About 45 Protestant churches belong to the council, which
provides social services such as food programs that feed about 400
elderly people daily, halfway houses and night ministries.
   Many of the services have been picked up by other agencies, but
sponsors are need for others, including a halfway house for women
convicts and their small children, and a day-care center.

<HEAD>Simon, Glickman Reintroduce Bill to Curb TV Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A renewed effort in Congress to curb violence
on television drew immediate challenges from broadcasters and from a
civil rights organization that said the move was a ``Trojan horse''
that could open the gates for government censorship of TV.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., and Rep. Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying
there was overwhelming evidence of a link between excessive TV
violence and children's behavior, introduced a bill Tuesday that
would grant a three-year antitrust exemption to the TV industry so
networks, local stations, the cable industry and producers could
formulate voluntary guidelines on TV violence.
   The bill is identical to a measure that Simon and Glickman
offered unsuccessfully last year.
   The National Association of Broadcasters and the American Civil
Liberties Union said the bill raised serious First Amendment
concerns.
   ACLU legislative counsel Barry Lynn labeled the bill `` a Trojan
horse to bring the government into the business of regulating the
content of television broadcasting and cable.''
   ``There is nothing voluntary about guidelines which emerge from a
regulated industry after Congress has instructed it about specific
programming it finds objectionable,'' he said.
   NAB spokeswoman Susan Kraus said, ``Can it ever be truly
voluntary when you have the government breathing down your neck?''
   She said that although the government ``can insulate the industry
from antitrust actions, it cannot insulate us from being sued on
First Amendment grounds.''
   She cited an attempt during the 1970s to institute a ``family
viewing hour'' on television between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. The industry
was sued by the Directors Guild of America on First Amendment
grounds and the family hour was abandoned.
   Simon said he did not intend to censor television or circumvent
First Amendment protections for free speech.
   ``The legislation does not permit or contemplate the
establishment of a private national censorship board or enforcement
authority,'' he said, and it presents ``no such threat to freedom of
speech or artistic expression.''
   But he said ``It's time for the television industry to forge a
partnership with America's families to scale back the atmosphere of
violence that is erupting in our communities, on our Main Streets,
even in our schoolyards.''
   He said that while a one-to-one link had not been established
between TV violence and violent behavior in America, ``study after
study has shown a connection between television violence and
negative and aggresssive behavior.''
   ``The evidence that televised violence contributes to aggressive
and destructive behavior is now nothing short of overwhelming,'' he
said.
   He pointed to resolutions on the subject passed by the American
Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association and
the American Medical Association.
   Last year's bill, like another one in 1986, passed the Senate but
died in the House. However, Simon said he felt the bill's chances
were better this year. His office said the bill had 34 co-sponsors
in the House and seven in the Senate, including Sen. Howard
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, the chairman of the Senate antitrust
subcommittee, and Sen. Strom Thurmond, the panel's ranking
Republican.

<HEAD>House Panel Bucks Bush on Minimum Wage Despite Veto Threat</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats hoping to boost the minimum
wage to $4.65 an hour moved closer to a showdown with the White
House by quickly rejecting President Bush's call for a smaller
increase coupled with a training wage.
   The Democratic majority of the House Education and Labor
Committee quashed Bush's proposal and passed its minimum-wage
measure Tuesday shortly after Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said
Bush's offer would be his last.
   ``Most definitely he has said, `This is it. This is as far as I
can go,''' Mrs. Dole said in threatening a presidential veto of the
Democrats' proposal for the second time in a week.
   Undaunted, the committee's 22 Democrats unanimously backed
legislation that would bring the minimum wage from its current $3.35
an hour to $4.65 an hour through three annual increases starting
Jan. 1, 1990. All 13 Republican members voted against that plan.
   The proposal that was sent to the full House does not contain a
sub-minimum training wage Bush has demanded. The president, in his
measure, advocated raising the minimum wage to $4.25 an hour by 1992
provided employers are allowed to pay new hires $3.35 during their
first six months on the job.
   Mrs. Dole first outlined specifics of the Bush plan last week
before the Senate Labor Committee, which nonetheless backed a bill
that essentially mirrors the one passed Tuesday by its House
counterpart.
   The administration proposal was submitted in writing for the
first time Tuesday when Republicans on the House committee
unsucessfully attempted to substitute it for the Democratic version.
   ``This is a compromise,'' Rep. William F. Goodling of
Pennsylvania, the committee's ranking Republican, said in
introducing Bush's plan. ``The president has gone way beyond
anything I'm sure your side thought you could ever sell to my side.''
   That was a reference to unsuccessful Democratic attempts to raise
the minimum wage during the Reagan admininstration. Still, the
Democrats said Bush has not come far enough in raising the minimum
and has gone too far in seeking to establish a six-month training
wage.
   Democrats in both chambers have indicated a willingness to
compromise with Bush on a training wage but have said such a
provision must have a clear requirement for actual training and a
shorter life than six months. Most Democrats also want the training
wage, if included in the legislation, to apply only to young people;
Bush wants it to cover any worker hired by a company for the first
time.
   In exchange for some compromise on that issue, the Democrats
expect Bush to accept their proposal to lift the minimum to $4.65.
   But Mrs. Dole indicated such hopes might prove unfounded.
   ``We've already compromised,'' she said. ``Legislation outside
these parameters would call for a veto.''
   Democrats said they hoped for Bush's sake that he was bluffing,
with one, Rep. Austin Murphy, D-Pa., saying he hoped a compromise
acceptable to all could be reached so that Democrats would not have
to ``embarrass'' Bush, presumably by overriding a veto.
   Committee chairman Augustus F. Hawkins, D-Calif., said he
expected the full House to pass the measure next week. Senate
passage is expected to come soon as well, after which a conference
committee would be named to iron out any differences.
   Mrs. Dole said the Labor Department projects 650,000 jobs would
be lost if the Democratic version of the legislation is enacted as
it now stands while 200,000 jobs would be lost under the Bush
proposal, which also would expand exemptions allowing some small
businesses to pay less than the minimum wage.
   The Democratic majority, however, disputed those figures.
   ``The track record hasn't proven that to be true and I don't
think it will in this instance either,'' said Rep. Charles A. Hayes,
D-Ill.
   The Democrats complained that opposition from Reagan to any
increase in the minimum wage has left it frozen at $3.35 for eight
years.
   If adjusted for inflation over that period the minimum would now
be $4.57 an hour and by 1992 would be $5.24 an hour, 59 cents higher
than called for in the bills sponsored by Hawkins in the House and
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., in the Senate.

   Honduras and Nicaragua are at odds
over whether the Bush administration's expected proposal for more
aid to Nicaraguan rebels violates a Central American agreement to
dismantle Contra rebel forces.
   A Honduran presidential spokesman on Tuesday said such a request
would not not contradict the Feb. 14 accords, which call for the
dissolution of the Nicaraguan rebels.
   ``The accord ... reached in El Salvador does not rule out
humanitarian help before the dismantling,'' said Marco Tulio Romero,
spokesman for Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo.
   But Barricada, the newspaper of Nicaragua's ruling Sandinista
party, on Tuesday maintained the aid plans ``trample'' on Central
American peace efforts.
   ``The United States cannot continue indefinitely with the double
standard of speaking in favor of peace when the only thing it wants
is to make war,'' the newspaper said.
   The neighboring countries were reacting to reports the Bush
administration will ask Congress for an extension of non-lethal aid
to the Contras.
   Washington has helped the Contras since 1981 in their fight
against the leftist Sandinistas, a campaign all but halted one year
ago after U.S. military aid to the rebels ceased and a truce was
signed by the warring parties.
   Azcona and four other Central American presidents agreed to draft
a plan by May 15 to demobilize the Contras, about 11,000 of whom
live in jungle camps in Honduras near the Nicaraguan border.
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua promised, in turn, electoral
and other reforms to bring greater democracy to his country. Ortega
moved up general elections by 10 months, to February 1990.
   In keeping with that agreement, Nicaragua's National Assembly on
Tuesday it would grant amnesty to 1,933 former national guardsmen,
most of them jailed since the triumph of the Sandinista revolution
in July 1979.
   Barricada said the announcment ``that Bush will ask Congress for
more humanitarian aid to maintain the Contras in Honduran territory
for a year to pressure Nicaragua clashes with the task of
demobilization and tramples the Central American accord.''
   The pro-government Nicaragua daily ``El Nuevo Diario'' said the
request would be a ``blow to the peace agreements.''
   Government sources in Washington and Contra leaders have told The
Associated Press the 12-month aid request is $40 million to $50
million.
   A $27 million six-month package of non-lethal aid approved by
Congress last year runs out at the end of March.
   ``They (the Bush administration) want something that'll see us
through well into the Nicaraguan election,'' U.S. Embassy spokesman
Charles Barclay said in Tegucigalpa.
   ``It is in Honduras' interests that these armed insurgent groups
don't remain orphans without humanitarian aid from the United
States,'' Foreign Minister Carlos Lopez Contreras told a news
conference.
   Honduran officials met in this capital Monday with the U.S.
undersecretary of state for political affairs, Robert M. Kimmitt.
   ``The purpose of his visit was to politically coordinate the
strengthening of Central American democracy,'' said Lopez Contreras.
``The United States and our government don't want armed groups to
remain permanently in Honduran territory, but we also support the
democratization of Nicaragua.''

<HEAD>AIDS Virus Resistance Said To Have No Immediate Impact On Patients</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The finding that some strains of AIDS virus are
resistant to treatment by the most widely used anti-AIDS drug will
not require any immediate change in use of the drug, researchers
said.
   A study by the drug's maker found that 11 patients with advanced
AIDS or AIDS-related complex, a related illness, were infected with
virus strains only partly responsive to treatment with the anti-AIDS
drug AZT.
   Five patients carried virus strains with ``very marked reductions
in sensitivity'' to the drug, according to a letter sent to doctors
by the the the manufacturer, Burroughs Wellcome Co. of Research
Triangle Park, N.C.,
   AZT, also known as zidovudine or Retrovir, is the only drug
approved in the United States to treat AIDS virus infection.
   ``People who are on AZT and are currently benefiting from AZT
should not panic and consider this a major setback,'' said Dr.
Anthony Fauci, director of the AIDS program at the National
Institutes of Health.
   ``Just because one can isolate a resistant strain from a patient
doesn't mean AZT is not effective in combating most of the viral
replication in the patient.''
   Preliminary results of the study were announced Tuesday in
London. A full report of the study, by Brendan Larder and Graham
Darby of Wellcome Research Laboratories in England and Douglas
Richman of the University of California, San Diego, will be
published soon in the journal Science.
   The development of resistant strains of infectious agents after
widespread use of a drug is common, doctors said. Many bacteria, for
example, have become resistant to penicillin and therefore must be
treated with other antibiotics.
   The same thing happened with genital herpes virus after the
introduction of a drug to treat it, said Dr. Sandra Nusinoff
Lehrman, head of the department of antimicrobial therapy at
Burroughs Wellcome.
   In that case, the viruses that became resistant to the drug also
became less able to cause disease, she said.
   ``I would say these findings don't in themselves require that any
alterations in patient therapy be made,'' said Lehrman.
   ``However, the thing you have to stress is that decisions about
the treatment of HIV (the AIDS virus) really are joint decisions
between a particular physician and his patient.''
   Fauci said two new anti-AIDS drugs are beginning human trials
now, and the use of those drugs in combination with AZT should
enable doctors to control any AZT-resistant strains of the human
immune deficiency virus that causes AIDS.
   ``You have other drugs that are also effective against the AIDS
virus,'' Fauci said. ``You either switch or use a combination of
drugs.''
   The two new drugs _ dideoxycytidine, or DDC, and dideoxyinosine,
or DDI _ are available at National Institutes of Health AIDS
treatment centers across the country for patients whose infection
might become severely resistant to AZT, he said.
   Eventually those drugs might be used in combination with AZT or
each other to treat resistant strains, he said.

<TEXT>
   St. Patrick, set down your shilelagh and
put up your dukes. Here comes that great grasshopper-driving saint,
Urho the Finn, and his day is first.
   ``St. Urho? It's a little known fact that he drove the
grasshoppers out of pre-glacial Finland. It just happens he did it
the day before St. Patrick supposedly drove the snakes out of
Ireland,'' said Tom Tikkanen, a Finlander in Calumet.
   With Tikkanen's guidance, the tiny town on Michigan's Lake
Superior shore held its first official St. Urho celebration this
year. The Oulu Hotshots brought their accordions up from Wisconsin
last weekend and Vi Wiitala drove over from Toivola. Calumet partied.
   St. Urho's Day isn't until Thursday. But the locals don't muddle
legend with fact.
   Tikkanen said this year's bash started after some Calumet folks
trolling Lake Superior with their snowmobiles snagged an old sauna
off the bottom and in it was the frozen body of the great saint
himself.
   ``We fired that sauna up and thawed him out,'' Tikkanen said.
   The Irish don't hold a corner on Blarney.
   The fact is, Urho is fiction from Minnesota.
   The legend of the legend is that in Virginia, Minn., a Finnish
department store employee named Richard Mattson grew tired of the
to-do over St. Patrick in 1956. He made up a St. Urho who drove out
frogs to save Finland's vineyards, said Dr. Marsha Penti, an
archivist at Suomi College in Hancock, Mich.
   The same year, another Finn, Sulo Havumak of Bemidji, Minn.,
created a St. Urho who pursued grasshoppers with a pitchfork.
Havumak had the first St. Urho party and it is his version that has
become legend, Penti said.
   ``Ever since then, the men and women have gone out and hopped
around like frogs or grasshoppers,'' Penti said.
   Well, maybe not.
   Urho spread like fire among the Finnish communities in the United
States. Governors of all 50 states have signed St. Urho's Day
proclamations. The saint's curly-toed boots have shown up in parties
and street celebrations from Fitchburg, Mass., to the Moose Lodge in
Apache Junction, Ariz.
   Menahga, Minn., has a chain saw carved wood statue of Urho
holding an impaled grasshopper on his pitchfork and saying,
``Heinasirkka, heinasirkka, mene taalta hiiteem.'' That means,
grasshopper, grasshopper, go to the devil, Penti said.
   A museum in Minnesota claims Urho's grave. Now, Calumet has his
sauna. And Penti heard someone someplace dyed their dog St. Urho's
colors: purple and green.
   Nowhere is Urho better loved than in Michigan's Upper Peninsula,
which boasts the nation's greatest concentration of Finlanders and
where Finnish is spoken by oldtimers on the streets.
   Even folks like 70-year-old Les Lark, who isn't Finnish, decided
to partake. In the 1970s, Lark celebrated St. Urho at his Escanaba
tvern.
   The local Irish didn't mind until the day Lark festooned Betty
Murphy's pub in Gladstone with a ``St. Urho is No. 1'' banner. Lark
asked all the CB-owning residents of Delta County to drive by and
toot their horn at Betty.
   Betty Murphy the next year marched on Lark's with Irish banners
and squirt guns filled with green food dye. The Finns of Escanaba
remembered St. Urho that day with great green battle scars.

<HEAD>Riegle Promotes Paying S&amp;L Cost Up Front</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposal for more up-front payments to close
insolvent savings and loans is gaining support among some Democrats
as an alternative to President Bush's bailout plan for the industry.
   The General Accounting Office was asked Tuesday by Sen. Don
Riegle, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, to work up
estimates on the impact of absorbing most of the bailout costs
immediately rather than spreading them over 30 years as Bush would
do.
   ``We may find ourselves a way to save an awfully lot of money,''
Riegle said after congressional auditors testified it would have
been cheaper to close and pay off depositors in 179 failed S&amp;Ls in
1988 that instead were merged and kept open through government
subsidies.
   Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher said he could not estimate
how much cheaper outright closings would have been. But because many
of the mergers arranged by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board carry
10-year aid packages that include tax breaks and guarantees against
losses for the new owners, he estimated the mergers plus expenses in
closing 43 other S&amp;Ls last year will total more than $62 billion
over a decade.
   Bush would pay for closing or merging another 350 S&amp;Ls at or near
insolvency through $50 billion to be raised over the next three
years from the sale of taxpayer-guaranteed bonds by a new off-budget
government corporation.
   The bonds would not be paid off for 30 years and only the annual
interest costs associated with them would be reflected in the
federal budget. But those interest costs would be $100 million to
$200 million more annually _ or $3 billion to $6 billion more over
30 years _ than if the tab for the bailout were simply lumped into
the federal debt.
   Riegle said dumping as much of the bailout costs as possible into
the fiscal 1989 budget would be a ``cleaner'' approach without
upsetting a resolve by Congress and Bush to meet a $100 billion
deficit target in the fiscal 1990 budget.
   Both have given up hopes of meeting the $136 billion deficit
target set in the 1985 Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law for fiscal
1989, which ends Sept. 30. The White House now says the 1989 deficit
will be more like $170 billion.
   ``This may be another way to work with the Gramm-Rudman
restraints and at the same time save the taxpayers an awfully lot of
money,'' Riegle said. ``Then we wouldn't be forced to make these
mergers, which are very expensive.''
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., a member of the House Banking
Committee, has endorsed a similar approach to Riegle's plan, as has
William Niskanean, a former economic adviser to President Reagan.
   According to Riegle's plan, the government would buy back many of
the notes and loans it sold at discounts to the new owners of the
institutions it merged in 1988 before Sept. 30.
   The plan also would include in the 1989 budget the cost of
closing and paying off depositors in the worst of the 350 insolvent
but still-operating S&amp;Ls.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken control of over 120
of those institutions in the two months since Bush announced his S&amp;L
proposal and plans to take control of another 100 before the end of
March.
   However, without the needed money in the government insurance
funds to pay off their depositors or subsidize their mergers, those
S&amp;Ls are still operating with losses mounting in the tens of
millions of dollars daily.
   The GAO estimated the cost of the 1988 S&amp;L closings and mergers
at $37 billion _ assuming all could be paid for immediately rather
than financed, and not including the $6 billion to $8 billion in tax
breaks that were a part of some packages.
   Both administration and congressional experts put the
present-value cost of resolving the other 350 insolvent institutions
at roughly $50 billion. That makes the total cost of the bailout
package about $90 billion _ if it all could be paid for in cash
instead of borrowing.
   ``I don't think people realize the magnitude of the problem,''
Bowsher said.
   ``This is bigger than the Marshall Plan,'' he said, referring to
the $13 billion _ $60 billion in today's dollars _ that the United
States spent rebuilding Europe after World War II.
   Bowsher said the cost to the government of just one S&amp;L merger
package alone in December was greater than the combined costs of the
government's bailouts of New York City, the Lockheed Corp. and the
Chrysler Corp. in the 1970s.

<HEAD>Report Urges Major Changes to Nation's Foremost Job Training Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's major job-training program puts
too much emphasis on getting people jobs quickly and too little on
giving them real skills, a study panel concluded in suggesting the
recession-spawned program has fallen out of step with today's
revived economy.
   The panel on Tuesday suggested nearly 30 changes in the Job
Training Partnership Act and its programs, most notably major
revisions in how JTPA money is targeted, adoption of long-term
funding commitments and increased spending to help youths find
meaningful work.
   The 38-member Job Training Partnership Act advisory committee
presented its report Tuesday to Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.
Earlier Tuesday, she told Congress the Bush administration soon
would recommend amending the program, created in 1982 with
legislation sponsored by Vice President Quayle, then an Indiana
senator, and Massachusetts Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.
   The study group was formed in July 1988 and consists of corporate
executives, and various school and elected officials.
   The authors, without referring directly to the JTPA sponors, said
they should not be blamed for program deficiencies that the report
said encouraged quick job placements over career-track training.
   ``That vision understandably was distracted by a severe recession
and federal encouragement to use all available resources to get
people back to work,'' the report said. ``Therefore, early emphasis
on placements became the routine business of JTPA.''
   The authors said any improvements in the program hinged on a
long-term funding commitment.
   ``Throughout the JTPA system, long-range planning has been
rendered virtually impossible by the short-term, year-to-year
orientation of the program, formula funding volatility and numerous
constraints currently embodied in the legislation,'' the report
said. ``The adoption of a longer-term perspective must become a
priority.''
   Mrs. Dole, in her testimony, said she would review the report and
gave no hints of what changes the administration would propose,
although she has talked vaguely in the past of better targeting of
JTPA funds, a major goal of the 38-member study panel.
   The report recommended a major revision of the formula used to
allocate JTPA money so that a majority of funding goes to train
economically disadvantaged people who either have serious skills
deficiencies or are welfare dependent.
   The current formula distributes two-thirds of JTPA funds for
adults on the basis of an area's unemployment rate regardless of
whether those unemployed people have serious skills shortages, the
report said.
   At the same time, the panel warned that short-sighted performance
objectives stressing cost and job placements in some cases have
encouraged quick-fix approaches that provide enrollees with too
little training but place them rapidly in jobs.
   In those cases job placements often are short term and the worker
is returned to the ranks of the unemployed without the necessary
skills to find a career position, the report said.
   The suggested changes, the report said, should end the principal
criticism of JTPA _ that it engages in ``creaming,'' or placing in
training programs those it considers most ready for employment
instead of helping those most in need of training.
   It also said training programs for youths should separated from
adult programs and bolstered with an additional $500 million, with
most of that money spent on dropouts and other unskilled youths no
longer in school.
   It also suggested restructuring youth-training programs with a
year-round focus instead of separate school year and summer programs.

<HEAD>Wright: No Third Term as Speaker if Ethics Findings Undermine Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright says he will accept
the blame for lapses in judgment if the House ethics committee comes
to that conclusion, and he will not seek a third term as speaker if
the findings undermine his support.
   ``If I were convinced in my mind that most of my colleagues
didn't want me to be speaker, I wouldn't run for speaker. I'd serve
out my term as effectively as I can,'' Wright, D-Texas, said during
an impromptu luncheon with a group of reporters.
   In another interview later in the day, he added: ``This is not
the driving ambition of my life, to succeed myself as speaker.''
   But he said his Democratic colleagues had given him no reason to
believe he will have to take that step, and added: ``I'm not
contemplating not seeking a third term.''
   The Texas Democrat seemed to blame some of his ethics problems on
lack of attention to his own finances, saying he had been
preoccupied throughout his long congressional career with being an
effective lawmaker.
   ``If the committee should say, `Well, Jim back there before he
was speaker should have done a particular thing or whatever, we
think this is bad judgment,' well, I'll accept that,'' Wright said.
   ``I have confidence in them, I'm not going to quarrel with that.
I probably have done things which in hindsight were poor judgment,
but weren't dishonest, wouldn't be a violation of the rules, but
they might be bad judgment.''
   Asked what his attorney, William Oldaker, had relayed to him from
the closed sessions of the ethics committee Oldaker has attended,
Wright said, ``I hear very confident expressions that the committee
cannot find that I have violated a rule, and surely haven't violated
a basic standard of honesty, at all.''
   At another point, he said: ``I'm at peace with myself.''
   But Wright also has evidenced nervousness about the ethics probe,
sending a mass mailing to his Fort Worth district last month
portraying himself as the victim of partisan politics and touting
the federal largesse he has brought home for his constituents.
   The House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, known as
the ethics committee, was resuming its closed-door deliberations
today after hearing closing arguments on Tuesday from the speaker's
lawyer, William Oldaker, and from the committee's special outside
counsel, Richard Phelan.
   It appeared that the panel would spend at least the rest of this
week deliberating the six charges against Wright, which include
allegations of misuse of his office for personal financial gain,
improper lobbying of federal officials and receiving free use of a
Fort Worth condominium.
   Sources, declining to be identified by name, have said the panel
is focusing heavily on Wright's dealings with George Mallick, a Fort
Worth friend and business partner. A final decision on whether to
seek sanctions against the speaker on any of the counts could come
next week.
   Wright acknowledged that an effort was under way by Democratic
colleagues to mount a public defense for him, led by Majority Leader
Tom Foley, D-Wash., and including Reps. Martin Frost, D-Texas, Steny
Hoyer, D-Md., Barney Frank, D-Mass., and David Nagle, D-Iowa.
   ``If the Republicans want to create a scene, a divisive issue,
our people will answer,'' he said.

   Nearly $55 million in Forest Service money that
the Reagan administration diverted from a land acquisition fund has
been restored, making it possible to add thousands of acres to
national forests in 22 states.
   The Forest Service had been told in the final months of the
Reagan administration to move the $54.9 million into its
firefighting fund in anticipation of forest fires in 1989, John
Leasure, budget officer for the Forest Service, said Tuesday.
   He said the fire season has just begun and it is too early to
tell how much will be needed, but about $40 million is available and
more could be obtained later if needed.
   The land being added to existing national forests is considered
necessary to protect forests from encroachment by developers or
other private interests.
   The largest expenditures and the forests involved are $8.04
million for Nantahala National Forest, N.C.; $7.4 million, Lake
Tahoe Basin, Calif.; $5.7 million, Columbia River Gorge, Ore.; $4.9
million, Green Mountain National Forest, Vt.; and $3.6 million,
Eleven Point Wild and Scenic River, Mo.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. and chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee, along with others in Congress had objected to the Office
of Management and Budget when the Reagan administration proposed to
spend land acquisition funds on firefighting.
   ``I am pleased that budget director (Richard) Darman has seen to
it that President Bush's expressed commitment to the environment has
been honored,'' said Leahy. ``I am glad that our last-ditch efforts
paid off and that the OMB reversed its earlier position.''
   Other expenditures are:
   California _ San Bernardino National Forest, $1 million.
   Colorado _ Arapahoe National Recreation Area, $120,400.
   Idaho _ Rapid River Wild and Scenic River $3,050; Sawtooth
National Recreation Area, $2.4 million; Main Salmon Wild and Scenic

<TEXT>
   Torrential rains in Australia's Outback
turned dry creeks into 12-mile-wide rivers and marooned remote
homesteads in the region's worst flooding in at least a
half-century, officials said.
   No casualties were reported Monday and Tuesday in what the daily
newspaper Sydney Morning Herald today said was believed to be one of
the heaviest rainfalls since Australia was settled by Europeans in
1788.
   Australian weather records, however, have only been kept since
1924.
   The Meteorogical Agency said parts of the parched continent had
experienced the first rain in years.
   In the state of South Australia, nearly 11 inches of rain fell in
24 hours. The normally dry Wilpena Creek became a 12-mile-wide river
while the opal mining town of Andamooka in Western Australia state
was knee-deep in water.
   Residents at Broken Hill, in far western New South Wales, said
reservoirs were almost overflowing after a year's supply of rain
fell in just two days. They said it was the worst flooding since
1932.
   Broken Hill Water Board spokesman Noel Wood said residents had
been forced to cope with severe water restrictions last week. Now,
he said, the town's reservoirs are at their highest level since 1974.
   The rains deluged three of the continent's six states, from
Western and central Australia to the eastern seaboard, causing
millions of dollars in damage and loss of livestock to isolated
rural farms.
   In Canberra, the federal capital, police warned children to stay
away from swirling stormwater drains throughout the city, where
flooding closed several roads.
   Many Outback farms were flooded out, and news reports headlined
the downpour as the ``The Big Wet.''

   A windy first day on the job may have brought a
quick end to the career of a high-rise window washer, who froze with
fear and clung to a pillar on the sixth floor before being rescued.
   Ray Trevino had lowered himself from the roof of the 22-story
Marriott Hotel at Texas Medical Center on Monday, but lost his
confidence when gusts blew him around in his chair.
   ``It just got too windy,'' Trevino said. ``It's really scary
being way up there when it's windy, and you're just hanging onto a
rope.''
   Trevino held onto the edge of the building for about 45 minutes
before he was rescued by firefighter Randy Fisher, who reached him
by using a 100-foot ladder.
   ``I said, `Ray, I'm as scared as you are now, so let's just take
this thing slow, one step at a time,''' Fisher said. ``He didn't say
a whole lot of anything.''
   Trevino said he didn't know if he would resume his window-washing
career.

<HEAD>Giant Iceberg Off Antarctica Said To Be Big As Hong Kong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's biggest iceberg,
believed to be about the size of Hong Kong, is slowly melting in
Antarctica and appears to pose no threat to shipping, a news agency
reported today.
   The iceberg, which has been codenamed B9, is the longest ever
accurately recorded and has travelled a 620-mile circle since it
broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf 18 months ago, the New Zealand
Press Association said.
   The agency said scientists had been worried it might block the
entrance to the U.S. research base at McMurdo Sound, where 700
people live during the Southern Hemisphere summer.
   The iceberg is now about 250 miles east of Ross Island and 185
miles from where it broke from the shelf, glaciologist Harry Keys
told the news agency.
   When it first cracked off the shelf it was 95 miles long, 22
miles wide and 1,155 feet thick _ dimensions that almost correspond
with the size of the British colony of Hong Kong, NZPA said.
   It said the the giant chunk of ice has since lost six miles of
its length. The agency gave no other details and Keys could not be
reached for independent comment.

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose back
beyond the 32,000-point level with a sharp gain today, while the
dollar lost marginally against the Japanese yen.
   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar closed at 129.88 yen,
down 0.04 yen from Tuesday's 129.92-yen finish. The currency opened
at 129.80 yen and fluctuated in a tight 129.75-129.90 yen range.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 171.39-point gainer
Tuesday, added another 376.13 points, or 1.19 percent, to finish
trading at 32,100.48, surpassing the 32,000-point level for the
first time since March 3, when it finished at 32,000.10.
   The Nikkei, which was higher across the board, rose notably in
the last 30 minutes of trading.
   Despite concerns that today was the account settlement day for
futures markets, in which the Nikkei's 225 spot issues are often
sold for profit-taking, the index rose mainly due to stability in
the bond and foreign exchange markets.
   ``Even before the release of the U.S. trade figure later today,
investors' buying interest was strong,'' said a dealer with Nomura
Securities, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The U.S. Commerce Department was to announce U.S. trade figures
for January later today and Tokyo dealers said they expect the
figure to narrow to about $10 billion, down from December's $11.89
billion.
   Construction issues were among the winners in active trading,
with the first-section volume estimated at 1.2 billion shares.
   In currency dealings, the dollar-yen rate moved little in
anticipation of the U.S. trade report, dealers said.
   Most Japanese investors made some position adjustments and
remained on the sidelines, trying to avoid making major moves before
the announcement of the major economic indicator, said a dealer with
a commercial bank in Tokyo.

<HEAD>Experiment Is First Attempt To Crystallize A Virus In Space</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first attempt to crystallize a virus in
space is taking place aboard Discovery as scientists use
weightlessness to try to design better crops and new drugs against
cancer, AIDS, emphysema and other diseases.
   ``From the crystals we will be able to learn the structure'' of
the virus, said biochemist Alexander McPherson of the University of
California, Riverside.
   ``If we know the crystal structures of viruses, we may be able to
design vaccines to prevent infection or drugs to lessen the effects
of infection'' by binding to targets on viruses that cause AIDS,
certain cancers, hepatitis, influenza and the common cold, he added.
   The virus in McPherson's shuttle-borne experiment is a harmless
one named STMV, or satellite tobacco mosaic virus. It is a parasite
virus that can replicate itself only when attached to TMV, or
tobacco mosaic virus, a disease that afflicts tobacco, tomato,
pepper and certain other plants.
   But STMV is ``the basic model for understanding the way viruses
are put together,'' said biochemist Charles Bugg of the University
of Alabama at Birmingham.
   ``Understanding its structure in detail would allow us to
understand all viruses better.''
   The STMV experiment, McPherson said, ``is the first time we've
tried to crystallize a virus in space.''
   STMV is among 15 substances, mostly proteins, inside Discovery's
60 crystallization chambers. The experiments, activated Monday, are
aimed at determining whether the weightlessness of space will let
scientists grow large, perfect crystals of proteins, viruses and
other substances.
   Gravity makes it extremely difficult to grow perfect crystals on
Earth. Efforts to grow crystals on previous shuttle flights yielded
mixed results, although some were successful.
   The overall crystallization project, led by Bugg, ``could improve
food production and lead to innovative new drugs to combat cancer,
AIDS, high blood pressure, organ transplant rejection, rheumatoid
arthritis and many other diseases,'' the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration said.
   Scientists need perfect crystals of proteins, viruses and other
substances so they can bombard the crystals with X-rays to learn
their precise three-dimensional structure. The structure of a
protein or virus determines what it does.
   Proteins control the functioning of all living things. Viruses
consist of basic hereditary information surrounded by a protein
shell. Researchers believe knowing the exact structure of a protein
or virus will let them alter what it does or develop drugs to block
what it does.
   On Discovery's flight last fall, Burroughs Wellcome Co. grew
crystals of reverse transcriptase, a protein that lets the AIDS
virus replicate in human cells. If the crystals help scientists
determine the protein's structure, they might be able to devise a
drug to hinder it and thus treat AIDS, McPherson said.
   On this week's flight, Biocryst Ltd. is trying to crystallize
influenza neuraminidase, a protein used by flu viruses to invade
human cells. The crystals might let researchers learn enough about
the protein to create a drug to block it's ability to trigger the
flu, Bugg said.
   Discovery also carries an experiment in which McPherson is
growing crystals of canavalin, the key protein in beans, peas and
other legumes _ humanity's third-largest source of food protein,
after meat and fish. Scientists hope to learn canavalin's structure,
then alter it to make legumes even more nutritious, McPherson said.
   University of Pennsylvania and Smithkline Beckman Corp.
scientists are trying to crystallize a protein that controls the
expression of genes, the basic units of heredity. Certain genes act
as switches to turn on cancer. Bugg said learning how the protein
works could aid development of anti-cancer drugs.
   Merck &amp; Co. again is trying to crystallize elastase, an enzyme
that degrades lung tissue, in an effort to develop drugs to block
degradation the lungs in emphysema.
   An Upjohn Co. experiment aboard Discovery is an effort to
crystallize human renin, an enzyme that regulates blood pressure.
Learning its structure could spur development of new drugs to
control high blood pressure.
   Eli Lilly Co. is crystallizing human growth hormone, which now is
used to spur growth in children with certain growth disorders. Bugg
said knowing the hormone's structure could lead to improved versions
that might be used to speed healing of wounds and burns.
   Some scientists have criticized hoopla about crystallization
experiments on the shuttle, saying it's a giant step from
crystallizing a protein or virus to being able to develop a useful
drug.
   Bugg agreed ``hype'' surrounds the experiments, but only because
their presence on the shuttle makes them subject to intense
publicity long before researchers know if the promising experiments
will produce valuable results.

<HEAD>Government Requiring Approval of Foreign Airline Security Procedures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign airlines operating in the United States
will have to have security programs approved by the Federal Aviation
Administration, under a new rule adopted by the government.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner told the Senate
Transportation appropriations subcommittee Tuesday that the new
requirement is aimed at making sure foreign carriers ``have adequate
security measures to protect civil aviation against criminal acts of
violence.''
   The rule was proposed by the government late last year, before
the Dec. 21 destruction of Pan American Flight 103 by a bomb over
Lockerbie, Scotland, which resulted in 270 deaths.
   American carriers already must have FAA-approved security
procedures.
   Under the new regulation, the 111 foreign airlines serving the
United States would have to submit their security procedures to the
FAA within 90 days of the rule's official publication in the Federal
Register. That is expected Thursday.
   The FAA is required to tell the carriers if their rules are
adequate within 30 days of receiving them. If they are judged
insufficient, the government could ultimately withdraw an airline's
permission to land in this country.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government should step up action
against companies that charge high rates without notice to people
who make long-distance calls on public phones, a Tennessee
congressman says.
   Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., said Federal Communications Commission
action last month was ``too little, too late'' in ordering five
``alternative operator service'' companies to clearly identify
themselves, make their rates available and not block calls to any
long-distance carrier.
   ``Much more is needed to protect the consumer'' from such
companies that now are handling 20 percent of the calls at the
nation's 7.5 million public phones, Cooper said Tuesday.
   ``Even the major AOS companies themselves have already agreed to
a code of ethics that goes farther than the FCC action,'' he said.
``Why is the FCC so timid when almost everyone agrees that major
reforms are needed?''
   Cooper, who along with Rep. Matthew J. Rinaldo, R-N.J., has
introduced legislation requiring such companies to charge ``just and
reasonable rates,'' said these companies are carging as much as 200
percent more than normal long-distance rates, charging for
incompleted calls, billing from cities the caller has never visited
and are channeling callers onto long-distance carriers they did not
choose.

<NOTE>Cost Estimates for Major Weapons Programs Soaring</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Statistics showing a higher estimated cost of
major Pentagon weapon programs ``have already been overtaken by
events,'' says a defense spokesman.
   The latest Selected Acquisition Report released Tuesday showed
that the estimated cost of the Pentagon's 94 biggest weapon programs
skyrocketed by $57.5 billion last year, primarily because the
services want to buy more of certain weapons in the mid-1990s.
   However, President Bush told Congress in February he would cut
back the military build-up plans of former President Reagan, so the
statistics are out of date, said Jim Turner, a Pentagon spokesman.
   The update is based on the budget and policy guidelines of the
Reagan administration because Congress mandates the review be
conducted every Dec. 31, Turner said.
   Nonetheless, the report outlines the priorities of the services
and the budget items over which Bush, Congress and the military are
likely to clash.
   As of Dec. 31, the Pentagon said the 94 key programs that Reagan
was pursuing carried a combined pricetag of $818.6 billion, up $57.5
billion or 7.6 percent from a quarterly estimate last Sept. 30.

   U.S. grocers predicted long-term effects from government warnings
not to eat grapes and other fruit from Chile as they moved millions
of dollars in produce from the South American country off store
shelves and ito warehouses.
   The Food and Drug Administraiton, in one of the largest actions
of its kind, warned consumers Monday not to eat fruit imported from
Chile after cyanide was found in two seedless red grapes shipped to
Philadelphia.
   Boston wholesaler Tom Freni said Tuesday he thinks ``it's going
to be the end of the season for Chilean products.''
   ``You're not going to turn people's minds around after what the
FDA said last night. Who's going to take a chance on buying the
product,'' said Freni, general manager of the J.R. Freni Co.
   Big supermarket chains and small grocers alike voluntarily pulled
grapes, plums, peaches, nectarines, raspberries and other Chilean
produce off the shelves nationwide. Although most stores put the
fruit in cold storage to await further instructions from the FDA,
some destroyed it.
   ``Public confidence is extremely perishable. Destroy a person's
confidence that they can enjoy a piece of wholesome fruit and you
have effectively closed down the market,'' said Tom Kovacevich,
chairman of the New York Produce Trade Association at the Hunts
Point produce market in New York City.
   Boston wholesaler Paul Tavilla predicted huge losses nationwide
as frightened customers shied away from all fruit, not just Chilean
produce.
   ``I figure we're losing $400 to $500 in (fruit) sales a day.
We'll probably have to eat it,'' said Tom Calcagno, manager of the
Youngs Bay Food Pavilion in Warrenton, Ore.
   Jack Montgomery, manager of Montgomery Produce in Yuma, Ariz.,
said wholesalers and retailers are hurt by such a scare ``but on a
long-term basis, even the local growers are hurt.'' He said the
warnings ``will make everyone scared of grapes.''
   A Los Angeles produce importer gobbled Chilean grapes at a news
conference Tuesday to dramatize his claim that the fruit is safe and
the government is ruining a booming industry unnecessarily.
   ``I think it's a major, major overreaction,'' Rick Eastes,
general manager of the David Oppenheimer California importer, said
of the FDA advisory. ``An industry worth $750 million in the United
States and Canada has been brought to a standstill. ... We have been
assassinated by insinuation.''
   The FDA said cyanide was confirmed in testing ordered at American
ports after an anonymous threat to poison Chilean fruit was
telephoned to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Chile's capital.
   Although federal officials said cyanide had only been found in
two grapes, FDA Commissioner Frank Young urged Americans to be
``safe rather than sorry.''
   Not all stores were heeding the warning. The Valu-King Food
Center in Morgantown, W.Va., is leaving the decision up to customers.
   ``If they want it (the fruit), fine. If they don't want it, let
it sit on the shelves,'' said employee Anthony Edward Bell.
   Most store managers said customers who return produce will get
refunds. They said most inquiries had been from concerned people who
had already eaten fruit. The FDA said consumers should not be
worried about fruit already consumed because cyanide is fast-acting.
   Emptied food bins were quickly filled with U.S.-grown produce.
``We may have more squash than usual out,'' said John Goodell, real
estate manager for Dan's, a Utah-based chain with seven stores.
   Virtually all the fresh grapes sold in the United States at this
time of year come from Chile, FDA officials said. Grapes make up
about two-thirds of the Chilean fruit currently being shipped to the
United States.
   Meredith Auerbach, director of marketing for California Table
Grape Commission, said most of California's crop is marketed from
May through January or February each year, so there shouldn't be
much on grocery shelves from California harvests now.
   Joey LaBarba, a manager at Dallas-based American Food Service,
said he personally wasn't worried about tainted fruit.
   ``A shipment of raspberries came in today, and when they got here
I ate them myself,'' LaBarba said.

<HEAD>Another Cabinet Member Resigns Because Of Financial Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Andreas Papandreou's top aide
resigned from the Cabinet over his alleged involvement in a banking
scandal, and a member of the governing party said the premier should
follow suit.
   Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas on Tuesday became the eighth Cabinet
member to resign since the scandal surfaced in October.
   ``Having stood by you for 25 years in all democratic struggles .
.. I resign from my position as minister to the prime minister
expressing my sensitivity,'' the premier's aide said in a letter to
Papandreou.
   Papandreou's government defeated a motion of censure by a
parliamentary vote of 155-123 Monday night. The motion was
introduced by the opposition New Democracy party, which said members
of Papandreou's Socialist government were deeply involved in the
scandal.
   Three legislators from Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist
Movement abstained in the voting, and the premier quickly expelled
them from the party for not supporting the government.
   One of the three, Antonis Tritsis, said Tuesday the government
should resign to save Greece's honor.
   He said if a caretaker government is not formed to prepare for
the June 18 elections then ``Papandreou puts a tragic end to his
political life.''
   Koutsogiorgas has repeatedly denied the claims by the
conservative opposition that he was directly involved in the
scandal, which centers around Greek banker George Koskotas.
   Koskotas is in a Salem, Mass., jail awaiting a hearing on a Greek
extradition request. He fled Greece in November after being indicted
in a $200 million fraud and embezzlement case.
   He has said Papandreou and Cabinet members authorized plans to
siphon millions of dollars from the Bank of Crete while Koskotas was
chairman and that they received millions of dollars in payoffs.
   Papandreou has denied the allegations and claimed Koskotas was
part of a CIA scheme to destablize Greece's Socialist government.
   The premier also threatened ``painful'' consequences if the
United States does not return Koskotas to Greece before the
elections. He did not say what the consequences might be but hinted
last week they could involve the future of U.S. military bases in
Greece.
   Washington has denied the allegations about the CIA, and New
Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis called them a ``children's
fairy tale.''

   Officials sought today to determine the
cause of the collision of two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighter jets in
which one pilot was killed and the other parachuted to safety, a
spokeswoman said.
   The accident took place Tuesday during a routine training mission
over central Cuenca province, about 85 miles southeast of Madrid's
Torrejon Air Base, Master Sgt. Cliff Washington said.
   Ms. Washington said the crash killed 1st Lt. Daniel R. Johnson,
25, of Wayzata, Minn., while the pilot of the other single-seat jet,
Capt. Steven Kempf, 27, of Glendale, Ariz., escaped unharmed.
   Both aircraft belonged to the U.S. 401st Tactical Air Wing
squadron, which is part of the U.S. 16th Air Force headquartered at
Torrejon.
   The accident was the first involving the top-of-the-line U.S.
fighter jet since Dec. 5, when the crash of an F-16 on a routine
mission killed the commander of the 16th Air Force, Gen. Winfield S.
Harpe.
   Seven Torrejon-based U.S. F-16 jets have crashed since 1984,
killing three American pilots, according to base records.
   The 72 F-16s in the 401st are to be transferred to a base in
Crotone, Italy, within three years under the terms of a new
eight-year defense agreement signed in December by Spain and the
United States.

<HEAD>State `Schlock Art' Law Goes On Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Competition, not aesthetics, is the issue behind a
state law defining ``schlock art,'' said an art dealer as cheap art
went on trial.
   ``The reason for this is the Rockport Art Association can't
compete with my prices,'' said United Oil Paintings Inc. President
Aaron Abady, who testified Tuesday in the non-jury trial before
Superior Court Judge John Cratsley.
   The Massachusetts law, which attorneys said is the first of its
kind in the nation, was passed in July at the urging of artists and
gallery owners in the seaside town of Rockport.
   It bans the sale of non-original art works unless they are
labeled ``not an original.'' Violators may be fined $100 per
painting.
   United Oil Paintings of Milford, which sells oil paintings for
$35 to $200, filed suit against the state in November, charging the
law is too vague and too broad and violates First Amendment rights
to free expression.
   Assistant Attorney General Douglas H. Wilkins argued that the
case was moot because United Oil has never been prosecuted, though
it has sold some 60,000 unlabeled paintings since the law was
passed. Wilkins argued that the law is intended to prevent deceptive
advertising and marketing and is constitutional.
   Abady said his company advertises ``Original oil paintings _
$89'' and has never had a consumer complaint filed.
   ``We're selling bedroom art,'' he said.
   One exhibit was a large box of oil paintings, including
landscapes, seascapes, still lifes, and two renditions of what
appeared to be the same lion in a small and a large size.
   ``These are original oil paintings, each one individually done,''
Abady told the judge as he displayed his wares.
   The testimony hinged on what exactly constitutes ``original''
art. Artists have complained that the ``schlock art'' is
mass-produced, often in an assembly-line type process, in the Far
East, and sold here as ``original.'' They claim some of the
mass-market offerings are copies of paintings by American artists,
living or dead.
   Abady testified that he has never seen mechanical reproduction of
paintings and does not believe such assembly lines exist.
   United Oil buys paintings from artists in the Far East, the
Dominican Republic and the United States and from art brokers in
bunches of 100 to 2,000 at a time but never without viewing each
individual painting first, he said. Each is signed by the artist, he
said.
   The paintings are sold in seaside art galleries and outlets from
Florida to Rockport and in shopping malls up and down the East
Coast, generating $5.5 million in sales last year, he said.
   Abady was scheduled to be cross-examined today. Attorneys said
the trial is expected to wrap up in three days.

<HEAD>Judge Signs Teamsters-Government Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The out-of-court settlement of the government's
civil racketeering case against the Teamsters may lead the nation's
largest union into ``the mainstream of honest unionism,'' a federal
judge says.
   ``The leaders of this union have today done their members a great
service,'' U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein said Tuesday
before signing the settlement.
   In signing the pact, reached just before the case was to go to
trial Monday, Edelstein noted that the union ``has had a long and
sordid career of corruption and involvement with criminal elements.''
   But in agreeing to the settlement, which will implement sweeping
reforms including the direct election of the union's top leadership,
Teamsters officials were promising to keep the 1.6 million member
organization ``free from the influence of organized crime,'' said
the judge.
   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the settlement ``represents a
major milestone in the government's 30-year war to clean up
pervasive La Cosa Nostra corruption in the Teamster's union.''
   Asked if the war was over, however, Romano conceded ``No.''
   James Grady, the union's general counsel, called the agreement
``satisfactory.''
   But Teamsters President William J. McCarthy, one of the
individual defendants in the case, was less enthusiastic.
   ``While I reluctantly accept the terms of the consent order, I
believe it is not the vindication and exoneration Teamsters deserve.
The fact is this suit should never have been filed in the first
place,'' McCarthy said in a statement.
   Under the tentative agreement, three court-appointed watchdogs
will oversee the entire union for three years.
   Edelstein, who received the settlement Monday afternoon, delayed
approving it to clarify ambiguities.
   The main change, made at the judge's request, was that the
government and the Teamsters will agree on two names to submit to
the judge for each of the watchdog positions, so that six names
instead of three will be offered for the three posts.
   The lawsuit, filed last June, sought to oust the union's
allegedly mob-influenced executive board. It claimed the Teamsters'
leadership had been dominated by organized crime, which ``deprived
union members of their rights through a pattern of racketeering''
and a ``campaign of fear'' that included 20 murders, dozens of
bombings, beatings, bribes, extortion and theft.
   Most of the 26 reputed mobsters originally named defendants were
dismissed when they either agreed, or were ordered, to drop any
involvement with the Teamsters. Five, including convicted Colombo
crime family boss Carmine ``Junior'' Persico, have been severed from
the case and are to be tried later.
   As a result of the agreement, the union's top leaders will be
elected directly by the membership in secret ballot votes beginning
in 1991.
   Currently, delegates to the national convention pick the
executive board members by roll call vote.
   The three overseers will be appointed for three years by the
judge with the joint approval of both sides. One would investigate
and prosecute alleged union corruption, one would administer
disciplinary action and the third would oversee elections.
   After the 1991 union elections are certified, the overseers will
be replaced by an independent review board empowered to investigate
and remedy allegations of corruption.
   The reforms, said the judge, ``affords some hope that the union
will become part of the mainstream of honest unionism.''

   Nurses are writing letters to NBC-TV to stop
``Nightingales,'' a show about student-nurses that the real-life
practitioners say reduces them ``to a bunch of sluts.''
   ``Why don't they just go ahead and do a show about lingerie
models instead,'' said Carol Grimaldi, an American Nurses
Association spokeswoman.
   Some nurses complain that the actresses who portray the five
student-nurses are frequently undressed and don't spend much time
studying.
   NBC defended the show, saying a registered nurse reviews each
script.
   ``Basically, it has to be viewed as an entertainment drama,''
said Merry Aronson, a publicist for the show. ``It just happens to
be that these girls are studying nursing.''
   Grimaldi said ``Nightingales'' couldn't come at a worse time, as
nursing schools are beginning to overcome recent enrollment drops.
   ``Things are looking up and then this comes along,'' she said
Tuesday.
   ``Nightingales'' belittles the profession because it consists of
``little sex kittens under the guise of going through a nurses
training program,'' she said.
   ``We do not want this type of image on TV. You're reducing nurses
to a bunch of sluts,'' said Dorothy Luniewski, an instructor at
Framingham Union Hospital School of Nursing.
   The Kansas City, Mo.-based nurses' association is encouraging
nurses to write to NBC to protest the show and is distributing a
list of the show's advertisers to its 186,000 members in efforts to
widen the campaign, Grimaldi said.
   Nurses have been upset with their small-screen portrayals before,
including ``China Beach,'' a story of Vietnam nurses, but reaction
to ``Nightingales'' far outweighs previous gripes, said Lynette
Aznabourian, spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Nursing Association.
   ``It is so blatantly sexually oriented,'' Aznabourian said.
   The show, produced by ``Charlie's Angels'' creator Aaron
Spelling, is his first offering on NBC since his longtime contract
with ABC expired. It is broadcast at 10 p.m. EST on Wednesdays and
has performed well against its competition of CBS's ``Wiseguy,'' and
ABC's ``China Beach.''
   Suzanne Pleshette stars as den mother to the young nursing
students.
   ``Nightingales'' writer-producer Don Roos said he agrees that the
stars spend a little too much time in their underwear.
   ``We are trying to be more sensitive to the amount of undress
that these women are in,'' he said.
   The hospital shower, a frequent target of the real-life nurses,
won't be around if the show is renewed next season, Roos said.
   But he said many of the nurses' criticisms are unfocused and
unfair.
   ``We always wanted to show that they (the characters) had
personal lives as well,'' he said.
   Linda Klein, the nurse who reviews ``Nightingales'' scripts, said
she has ordered changes in some scenes, adding:
   ``I think these nurses forget and I think that what they're
really irate about (is) maybe we're showing (students) a little
subservient of the doctors.''

<HEAD>Likud Edges Out Labor in Local Polling Runoff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALLYN FISHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc cemented its domination of Israeli local government by
defeating the rival Labor Party in 11 election runoffs.
   Results published today also showed a victory for Islamic
fundamentalists who wrested control of two more local councils in
Arab villages from popular non-religious parties.
   The runoffs were held Tuesday in 27 townships and cities where
candidates failed to win a minimum of 40 percent of vote in local
elections held Feb. 28.
   The Likud's gains mean the party now controls 44 townships, as
compared to only 26 in 1983 elections. The left-leaning Labor Party
won eight councils Tuesday, bringing its total to 32, a significant
decline from 54 in 1983.
   Shamir has said the results represent a vote of confidence for
Likud's policy of rejecting territorial concessions or any dialogue
with the PLO. Labor has said local issues had an effect on the
outcomes.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is in Washington to discuss
Middle East peace prospects with American leaders, telephoned his
party headquarters in Tel Aviv to praise their victory, Israeli
radio stations reported.
   ``This is a continuation of the Likud's big achievements,'' Arens
was quoted as saying.
   Boaz Shapira, a political science professor at Tel Aviv
University said the polling results indicated ``a new tendency, an
upheaval.
   ``The Likud is now adding local government to its control of
central government,'' he said on Army radio.
   Labor leaders did not concede defeat, however, and voiced
satisfaction over winning tight races in two key traditional Likud
strongholds: the Tel Aviv suburb of Rehovot and Beit Shemesh on the
outskirts of Jerusalem.
   ``We have won proof that we are capable of beating the Likud,''
Labor secretary general Micha Harish said on the radio.
   ``Whoever was eulogizing the Labor Party was making a big
mistake,'' Labor's leader and Finance Minister Shimon Peres was
quoted by the radio as saying.
   Islamic fundamentalists, meanwhile, emerged victorious in the
Arab villages of Rahad and Jaljoulya. The fundamentalists' success
has sparked concern among Israeli officials who fear a rise of Arab
nationalism among Israeli Arabs.

<HEAD>Praise For Federal Ban in Import of Assault Weapons</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Semiautomatic Weapons, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials in California praised a new federal import ban on
semiautomatic weapons, but some gun store owners predicted it will
whet the public's appetite for the firearms.
   ``I can't stop shaking from the excitement,'' said state
Assemblyman Michael Roos of Los Angeles, author of a bill approved
Monday by the California Assembly that would virtually ban the sale
of of more than 40 types of semiautomatic assault weapons.
   ``Not in my wildest imagination would I have ever dreamed that
within 24 hours of the Assembly taking action that the United States
government ... would effectively ban the importation of these
weapons.''
   The Bush administration order issued Tuesday suspends the
importation of more than 110,000 assault-type weapons for which
import applications are pending, said national drug control director
William J. Bennett.
   Affected by the decision are imports of AK-47s, Uzi carbines,
FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well as Steyr Aug semiautomatic
weapons.
   On Jan. 17, a disturbed drifter, Patrick Purdy, used an AK-47 to
kill five children and wound 30 other people at a Stockton, Calif.,
elementary school.
   Using the weapon, which allows the shooter to fire single shots
as quickly as he can pull the trigger, Purdy was able to fire 106
bullets in two minutes. He then shot and killed himself with a
handgun.
   A rising death toll from the use of semiautomatic weapons in gang
warfare had already prompted an outcry against the guns. But the
Stockton tragedy crystallized opposition and led to a nationwide
movement to ban assault weapons.
   The weapons have already been banned by ordinances in Los Angeles
and Cleveland.
   ``This is great news. Today's action is long overdue and I urge
the administration to make it permanent,'' California Attorney
General John Van De Kamp said of the federal import ban. ``I
strongly encourage the president and the Congress to follow
California's lead and enact legislation to permanently ban assault
weapons.''
   Van De Kamp said he thought the Stockton shootings and the
Legislature's move to restrict assault weapons in California ``have
had a tremendous impact on the administration's thinking on this
issue.''
   Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates called the import ban ``a
step in the right direction.''
   The Bush administration's action Tuesday also brought praise from
Robert Strang, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration
in New York.
   ``Certainly, anything that's done is helpful to us,'' Strang
said. ``In the last year, agents across the country have been issued
submachine guns because of the automatic weapons that we're up
against on a daily basis. ... Certainly, anything we can do to
lessen the firepower of the drug traffickers is going to be
beneficial to us.''
   But in Dallas, some gun store owners predicted the ban on
imported assault rifles will increase weapons sales.
   ``I'll probably have 200 calls tomorrow,'' said Charles Zuber,
owner of Guns Unlimited. ``Anytime you tell people they can't have
something, they want to have it.''

   Rickles' wife, Barbara, had just parked the white 1988 XJ6 on
Tuesday afternoon near their daughter's apartment and was getting
out of the car when a man pointed a large revolver at her, said Los
Angeles County sheriff's Deputy Kathryn Nielsen.
   The gunman demanded her purse and the keys to the car.
   Mrs. Rickles handed over the keys. The comedian got out of the

   The Rickles were uninjured, but the loss was put at $35,000, the

<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Edward Abbey was remembered upon his
death as an ardent environmentalist whose writings decried paved
roads and billboards in the desert Southwest.
   The man dubbed ``the Thoreau of the American West'' by ``Lonesome
Dove'' author Larry McMurtry died Tuesday at age 62 at his home of
internal bleeding, said Jack Macrae, a friend who is editor-in-chief
of Henry Holt and Co.
   Abbey wrote 19 books, fiction and non-fiction, including the 1975
novel ``The Monkey Wrench Gang,'' a story of radical
environmentalists who plot the destruction of Glen Canyon Dam in
northern Arizona. Two of his books were made into movies: ``The
Brave Cowboy,'' from which came the 1962 Western, ``Lonely are the
Brave,'' starring Kirk Douglas, and ``Fire on the Mountain'' in 1981.
   Former Interior Secretary Stewart Udall said Abbey ``became a
courageous and outspoken advocate of environmental values through
his writing and I believe he's one of the Westerners who has left a
lasting legacy.''
   A transplanted Pennsylvanian, Abbey first came West in 1944. He
lived in Tucson since the early 1970s.
   Macrae's company published Abbey's most recent book, ``The Fool's
Progress,'' a novel detailing the travels of an introspective man.
   Abbey called the work his ``fat masterpiece,'' Macrae said.
   The author dreamed of returning the West to a pristine setting,
and bemoaned its adulteration by the cement and asphalt of
civilization.
   ``I'd like to see the whole American West made into a
wilderness,'' he said in a 1987 interview with The Associated Press.
   He once said there was nothing wrong with throwing beer cans out
car windows since paved roads were abominations and unworthy of
respect.
   His writings have been credited by founders of Earth First!, a
no-compromise environmental group, with crystallizing their
philosophy.
   Abbey resisted descriptions of himself as an environmentalist or
naturalist. ``If a label is required,'' he wrote, ``say that I am
one who loves the unfenced country.''
   His works included ``Desert Solitaire,'' ``Beyond the Wall:
Essays from the Outside,'' ``The Journey Home: Some Words in Defense
of the American West'' and ``One Life at a Time, Please.''
   His agent, Don Congdon, said Abbey had been finishing a sequel to
``The Monkey Wrench Gang'' called ``Hayduke Lives!'' He said the
book could be published in 1990.
   Abbey taught in the creative writing program at the University of
Arizona.
   He attended the University of New Mexico, worked part time as a
park ranger and firefighter, and as a writer and a radical.
   Besides his wife, Clarke, Abbey is survived by three sons, two
daughters and his father, Paul Revere Abbey.

   A state trooper responding to a mother's
urgent plea stopped a school bus and confiscated grapes from an
11-year-old girl and several other children.
   Sally Johnson and more than 50 other choir members from Pleasant
Valley School in a Portland suburb were traveling toward Eugene for
a music festival Tuesday when Trooper Rod Beach pulled the bus over.
   Beach climbed on and wanted to know if a Sally Johnson was aboard.
   Sally nervously identified herself. ``Can I have your lunch?''
asked the no-nonsense trooper.
   Beach said the grapes Sally'd cajoled her mother into buying the
previous night could be contaminated by cyanide.
   ``What's going to happen to me?'' asked Sally. ``Am I going to be
arrested?''
   Beach took Sally's contraband into custody, and several other
students also surrendered grapes.
   Sally's mother, Catherine, had not heard the federal warning
about contaminated Chilean grapes until after she had put Sally on
the bus. When she heard the news, she called state police.
   ``I tried to get her to buy a banana,'' she said later.

   A state prison inmate scheduled to
testify as a defense witness in the murder trial of another prisoner
was bludgeoned to death with an iron bedpost, officials said.
   A judge immediately declared a mistrial in the trial of William
``Red'' Snyder, who is charged with murder in the stabbing death of
another inmate during a Jan. 1, 1986, riot at the state prison at
Moundsville.
   Randy Gossett, a lawyer who had subpoenaed John Gideon Perry and
12 other inmates to testify Tuesday, had interviewed the men at the
Harrison County Jail shortly before Perry was killed.
   ``They slapped each other on the back. They shook hands. They
were all here to testify for my client,'' said Gossett, who is
representing Snyder.
   Authorities notified him of Perry's death about 90 minutes later.
   Harrison County Circuit Judge Daniel McCarthy granted Gossett's
request for a mistrial because of Perry's killing.
   ``We asked for a mistrial ... over concerns for our own safety,''
Gossett said. ``How do you go down and talk to a group of people who
just murdered somebody and have a meaningful conversation?''
   Marshall County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney Jeffrey Kessler
said he was unsure whether he would ask for a new trial, saying,
``What's the use?''
   Snyder already is serving a life sentence without parole for
another murder conviction. The trial was moved to Harrison County
because of pretrial publicity in Marshall County.
   ``They all backed Perry into a corner and just beat his brains
out,'' said Gossett in an interview outside the jail. ``They used a
frame from an iron bed.''
   A doctor at the scene said Perry suffered severe head injuries in
the beating. No charges have been filed in Perry's death.
   Perry, 39, was acquitted in January of a murder charge in the
1986 slaying of inmate Danny Lehman, who was stabbed to death in the
prison's notorious, maximum-security North Hall.
   Prosecutors said Perry headed a prison gang called the Aryan
Brotherhood and said Lehman was the head of a rival gang named the
Avengers.
   Snyder, who went on trial Monday in Harrison County Circuit
Court, was accused in the death of state prison inmate Kent Slie,
who was stabbed 18 times during the 1986 uprising.

<TEXT>
   In what legal authorities called the nation's
first international telephone plea, a federal judge heard a prison
inmate in Canada plead guilty to drug charges.
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise sat at the head of a
conference table in his chambers Tuesday as Claude Tremblay admitted
participating in a northern New Jersey-based drug ring prosecuted in
1982.
   Defense attorneys, the prosecutor, news reporters and the court
reporter listened to Tremblay's voice over a loudspeaker.
   Tremblay spoke from Archambault prison near Montreal, where he is
serving a seven-year jail term for an unrelated armed robbery.
Debevoise sentenced him to five years' probation.
   ``I haven't heard of a guilty plea by phone,'' said David
Sellers, a spokesman for the federal Administrative Office of the
Courts in Washington.
   ``There's a whole wave, a big push, to be innovative in a
technological sense'' among courts, he said. A number of state
courts arraign defendants by phone, and in some courts, lawyers are
allowed to file lawsuits by facsimile, Sellers said.
   Arguments on pretrial motions or emergency search warrant
applications are more examples of telephone use by the courts, said
Lloyd Weinreb, a professor at Harvard Law School.
   Weinreb said a phone plea is ``not something I'm aware of but it
doesn't strike me as very remarkable.''
   The long-distance hearing took 1{ years to arrange and needed
approval from the U.S. State and Justice departments, Debevoise and
Canadian authorities, said attorneys in the case.
   ``After the initial chuckle, everybody said there's nothing that
says you can't do it,'' said Michael V. Gilberti, senior trial
attorney in the U.S. attorney's office who arranged the plea.
   As part of the plea, the government agreed not to pursue
additional charges, if any, against Tremblay, 50, in exchange for
his guilty plea to a drug conspiracy. Tremblay was indicted in
November 1982 with 21 other people in a large-scale drug operation
that distributed cocaine, amphetamines and Quaaludes.
   Tremblay admitted helping supply the group with Quaaludes.
According to the Probation Department, all but two of the other
defendants pleaded guilty. One is a fugitive and the other had
charges dismissed.
   Tremblay, a Montreal-born former construction worker, was
arrested on a New Jersey warrant in Canada in January 1985. A month
later, Canadian authorities implicated him in a 1984 armored car
heist in Ottawa. He pleaded guilty to that charge and went to jail
in 1987.
   In a plea agreement dated Sept. 4, 1987, Tremblay agreed to waive
his right to be present before a judge and to submit himself to the
jurisdiction of federal court in New Jersey. He also agreed not to
fight extradition. In turn, the government said it wouldn't oppose a
request by Tremblay to serve a prison term on the drug charge in
Canada.
   Defense attorney John Iannuzzi, who specializes in defending
people in Canada charged with crimes in the United States, sees a
future for such phone pleas.
   ``If we can get to the point where we can eliminate extra expense
and avoid getting people here from all over the world, it would
certainly expedite the system of justice,'' he said.

   The U.S. dollar rose against all major foreign
currencies except the British pound and Canadian dollar today in
Europe ahead of the release of U.S. trade figures for January. Gold
prices eased.
   Foreign currency dealers said they expect the trade figures to
show a narrowing of December's $10.2 billion deficit and lift the
market from its week-long doldrums.
   ``Sentiment is in favor of the dollar and most expect the dollar
to be bid higher,'' said one dealer in Rome.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.04 yen to a closing 129.88. Later, in London, it
was quoted higher at 130.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.8635 West German marks, up from 1.8630
   _1.5980 Swiss francs, up from 1.5935

   In London, one British pound cost $1.7250, more expensive for
buyers than late Tuesday's $1.7170.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $394.40 a troy ounce,
down from $395.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.45.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $394.55, down from $395.25 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose 54 cents to close at a bid
$395.91.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $6.15 a troy ounce,

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful storm buffeted the nation's midsection this morning,
dumping more than a foot of snow in upper Michigan and driving
thunderstorms and gale-force winds through Indiana and Ohio.
   Snow and high winds prevailed in the upper Great Lakes and upper
Mississippi Valley. Accumulations ranged up to 16 inches at
Wakefield, Mich., by late Tuesday, 10 inches at Eau Claire, Wis.,
and 7 inches at Minneapolis.
   A winter storm warning remained in effect this morning for
eastern upper Michigan and northern lower Michigan. Snowfall totals
in western upper Michigan may approach 2 feet.
   Strong winds circulating around the storm's powerful low pressure
center kicked up dust in the central Plains, sharply reducing
visibility and closing some roads in western Kansas Tuesday.
   Gale warnings were in effect for Lake Huron and Lake Erie, and
winds in central Indiana gusted to 64 mph at Marshall.
   Severe thunderstorms developed ahead of the storm, producing
large hail and damaging winds from Illinois to Ohio.
   In Indiana, golf ball-size hail was reported at Walkerton and
Columbus. Thunderstorm winds gusted to 60 mph at Detroit and
Cincinnati and reached 62 mph at Durand, Mich.
   Rain fell over the Middle Atlantic States, the lower Great Lakes
and the northern Pacific Coast.
   Snow fell in parts of Idaho, reducing visibilities to near zero
in the north-central part of the state.
   Today's forecast called for showers and some thunderstorms in the
southern and central Appalachians, rain in the upper Ohio Valley
across New York state and into New England, and rain in much of the
Pacific Northwest. Scattered snow was forecast from the northern
Rockies across North Dakota into much of the upper Great Lakes.
Winds were expected to be strong and gusty from the upper Ohio
Valley into the central Appalachians.
   Highs were expected to be in the teens and 20s from eastern
Montana across North Dakota, eastern South Dakota and the upper
Mississippi Valley to the northern part of the upper Great Lakes;
the 30s and 40s from Washington state to the northern Rockies, the
central Plains, the middle Mississippi Valley and the rest of the
Great Lakes; the 70s and 80s from Southern California across
southern Arizona and New Mexico, most of Texas, the Gulf Coast,
Florida and the southern and middle Atlantic Coast. The remainder of
the nation were expected to have highs in the 50s and 60s.
   Temperatures at 2 a.m. EST ranged from 8 degrees below zero at
Warroad, Minn., to 73 degrees at Key West, Fla.

<HEAD>Israelis Turn Over Taba Resort To Egypt After Years Of Wrangling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By G.G. LaBELLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TABA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egyptians today raised their flag over this
long-disputed Red Sea resort as an Israeli convoy pulled out, ending
a territorial dispute that bedeviled the neighbors' relations for
seven years.
   Egyptian troops carrying rifles entered the 250-acre strip of
beach in groups of three. Hundreds of Egyptian workers climbed a
hill overlooking the resort, sang their national anthem and chanted
``Allahu Akbar,'' God is Great.
   At the same time, a convoy of dozens of Israeli buses, police
vehicles and cars left Taba along with about 50 protesting hotel
workers who sang Israel's national anthem. Two Israeli patrol boats
stood off the beach.
   A contingent of green-bereted Israeli border police stopped to
shake hands with Egyptian police before departing.
   A large Israeli flag was defiantly waved from the top floor
window of the 10-story Sonesta Hotel, apparently by an Israeli hotel
guest, as the Egyptians raised their black, white and red flag.
   The Israelis had lowered their flag during the night.
   Today's pullout was preceded by last-minute demonstrations by
some of the Sonesta's 350 Israeli workers, who fear losing their
jobs and demand that Israel guarantee the jobs or provide
compensation.
   During the flag-raising, hotel workers burned tires on a hill
overlooking the hotel, sending up a large column of black smoke.
   ``We want our rights. The government is prepared to give back the
land, but they can't give us up,'' an Israeli woman shouted at
police, who had arrested several workers earlier.
   Israel radio broadcast live from the scene. ``From this moment,
Taba is Egyptian,'' the announcer said dramatically.
   Yitzhak Lior, deputy director general of the Israeli foreign
ministry and the senior Israeli present, said ``We went to court,
and this was the decision. At the bottom line, we arrived at a
mutual compromise without scars.''
   Ahmed Al Masiri, Egypt's counsel-general in the adjacent Israeli
resort of Eilat, was quoted by Israel radio as saying the path to
improved relations between the former adversaries was ``now open.''
   ``I hope this will be a bridge to peace, peace between the two
peoples,'' he was quoted as saying.
   However, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir of Israel, said: ``We are not celebrating. We are sad that we
have been forced to give up Taba, never mind the reason. But we
accept the decision, and we are carrying it out.''
   The turnover came seven years after Israel ended a staged pullout
from the Sinai Peninsula, which it captured in the 1967 Middle East
war and returned as part of a U.S.-mediated peace treaty signed
March 26, 1979.
   Taba's return also comes at a time of increased pressure on
Israel to yield the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in exchange
for peace under pressure of the 15-month Palestinian uprising.
   Butros Ghali, Egypt's minister of state for foreign affairs, said
resolving the conflict over Taba peacefully ``is a victory for the
rule of international law'' and the provisions of the 1979 treaty.
   The Taba agreement worked out with international arbitration and
U.S. mediation calls for the hotel to be sold to Egypt for $37
million and the adjacent holiday village of thatched beach huts was
sold for $1.5 million.
   There appeared to be no refusal by Israelis to leave Taba as
there was in Sinai when authorities had to forcibly remove Israeli
settlers from the town of Yamit.
   On the beach, green bereted Israeli border police emptied their
guard hut at the former barbed wire frontier and left.
   Nearby, Dudu Oren, 31, a lifeguard at Taba beach for eight years,
cleared out his shack and piled his belongings on the beach.
   Oren said he had been married on the beach in Taba and gave his
2-year-old son the Hebrew name of Yam for the sea that laps its
shores.
   He said his whole life was tied up in Taba but that he hoped his
leaving ``will be good for peace.''

<HEAD>Construction Pioneer Stephen Bechtel Dies at 88</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stephen Davison Bechtel Sr., an
engineering and construction giant whose accomplishments included
Hoover Dam and an entire city in Saudi Arabia, has died after a
brief illness. He was 88.
   Bechtel, longtime head of the company in San Francisco that bears
his family's name, died at Merritt Peralta Medical Center Tuesday.
At his family's request, the nature of his illness was not disclosed.
   Under Bechtel's guidance, the company built Hoover Dam, the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid
Transit system and the Saudi Arabian city of Jubail. The company
also built thousands of miles of pipelines and helped pioneer the
field of nuclear power.
   A doodle on the back of an envelope was often all the information
Bechtel needed to envision a huge project. The 718-mile Canadian
Trans Mountain Pipeline started that way over lunch in 1949.
   A native of Aurora, Ind., Bechtel joined his father's
construction firm at age 19 after serving in World War I and
attending the University of California at Berkeley.
   He was named president of W.A. Bechtel Co. in 1935 following his
father's death. Bechtel began to transform the business into one of
the world's largest international engineering and construction
companies. The company is now called Bechtel Group Inc.
   Bechtel remained president until 1960, when he turned over
day-to-day responsibilities to his son, Stephen Davison Bechtel Jr.,
but remained active in the company as chairman of the board.
   In 1965, he retired to the position of senior director. He
remained active in the organization's activities until his death.
   Forbes magazine last year estimated his wealth at $390 million.
   Among dozens of honors and citations received during his
lifetime, Bechtel received four honorary doctor of laws degrees and
an honorary doctorate of public service.
   He was named to Fortune magazine's Hall of Fame for Business
Leadership, and was among the ``Top Ten Construction Men of the
Half-Century,'' named by the American Society of Civil Engineers.
   Fortune called Bechtel ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world,'' and added his name to a list that includes
Henry Ford, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie.
   Besides his son, Bechtel is survived by his wife, Laura Peart
Bechtel of Oakland; a daughter, Barbara Bechtel Davies; seven
grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Longtime Suburban Detroit Congressman Dies at 63</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   James G. O'Hara, a Democratic congressman from
suburban Detroit from 1958 to 1976, has died at George Washington
University Medical Center. He was 63.
   O'Hara, who had lung cancer, was a lobbyist and attorney with the
law firm of Patton, Boggs &amp; Blow when he died Monday. He joined the
firm in Washington in 1976 after losing the U.S. Senate primary
election to Sen. Donald Riegle.
   He first won election to the House by five votes after two
recounts, becoming the first Democrat to represent the Thumb region
north of Detroit in Congress since 1895.
   O'Hara pursued a generally liberal, pro-labor agenda, said Macomb
County Circuit Judge John Bruff, the congressman's campaign manager
and district representative.
   ``His slogan for his first campaign was `For Full Employment,'''
Bruff said Tuesday. ``He also was one of the congressional
architects of the Great Society programs, Medicaid, Medicare, the
civil rights bills ... the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.''
   O'Hara moved from Washington to Detroit when he was 13. He earned
bachelor's and law degrees from the University of Michigan after
serving as a combat paratrooper during World War II. O'Hara
practiced law in Detroit before joining Congress.
   Survivors include his wife, Susan, five sons and two daughters.

<HEAD>Claude ZoBell, Pioneering Marine Researcher, Dead at 84</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LA JOLLA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Claude Ephraim ZoBell, a scientist who
discovered living organisms at extreme ocean depths and was known as
the father of marine microbiology, has died of cardiac arrest. He
was 84.
   ZoBell, who died Monday at Scripps Memorial Hospital, is credited
with discovering 65 species of ocean bacteria. He also was noted for
discoveries on how microorganisms affect the formation and
transformation of petroleum.
   ``Claude ZoBell's contributions to marine biology and the ecology
of the oceans is acclaimed worldwide, but less known was his devoted
service to the scientific community,'' said Edward Frieman, director
of Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of
California, San Diego.
   ``His leadership in the field of marine microbiology drew many
researchers from all over the world to his laboratory, and his
generosity in directing younger scientists will last for many years
into the future.''
   ZoBell, a professor emeritus at Scripps since 1972, was the first
researcher to recover and cultivate living organisms from ocean
depths greater than 20,000 feet, said George Somero, chairman of the
Marine Biology Research Division of Scripps Institution.
   ``Claude ZoBell's discoveries that microbial life is possible in
such extreme habitats as the deep sea opened entirely new vistas for
later generations of microbiologists,'' Somero said.
   King Frederick IX of Denmark awarded ZoBell the Galathea Medal in
1952 for successfully recovering living bacteria from more than
34,000 feet of water in the Mindanao Trench near the Philippines.
   ZoBell joined the Scripps Institution in 1932 as an instructor.
His early research included studies of how bacteria helps create oil
in marine sediments.
   His discovery that bacteria can cause oil to separate from
sediments won a patent for the process in 1947, which ZoBell
assigned to the American Petroleum Institute for free public use.
His research has shed much light on how microbial action affects oil
spills, Frieman said.
   An author who published nearly 300 scientific papers and one
textbook, ZoBell founded the international Geomicrobiology Journal
in 1976 and served as its editor until 1981.
   ZoBell was born in Provo, Utah, and earned bachelor's and
master's degrees in bacteriology from Utah State University in
Logan. He received his doctorate from the University of California
at Berkeley in 1931.
   Survivors include his wife of 42 years and a fellow
microbiologist, Jean, who worked with ZoBell on many of his
projects; two sons, 11 grandchildren and 12 greatgrandchildren.

<HEAD>Radical Students Clash With Riot Police In Three Cities</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of radical students fought
riot police with clubs, firebombs and rocks in three cities today
and announced a nationwide campaign to defeat President Roh Tae-woo
in an upcoming referendum.
   The student councils of 38 colleges and universities in Seoul
said they would launch anti-government protests to overthrow Roh's
government in alliance with dissident political groups.
   About 700 students, shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!'', battled
riot police who responded with tear gas for an hour outside the main
gate of Seoul's Sejong University. No arrests or injuries were
reported.
   Fighting also broke out at Dankuk University in southern Seoul
where about 500 students, demanding Roh's resignation and a halt to
joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises now being held, tried to
march into the streets.
   Police fired tear gas to disperse the protesters after a two-hour
battle.
   In the central city of Taejon, about 1,000 students, hurling
firebombs and rocks, battled riot police who retaliated with tear
gas, news reports said. The protesters shouted slogans against Roh
and his government.
   In the southern city of Kwangju, the South Korean news agency
Yonhap reported, about 5,000 students held an anti-Roh rally and
vowed to defeat the president in the referendum, which is expected
to be held next month.
   Roh said in a 1987 campaign pledge that he would seek a midterm
appraisal of his performance after the Seoul Olympics, which ended
last October. Under pressure from the opposition, he said last week
that he would fulfill the pledge by holding a referendum.
   Roh has said that in the referendum people would be simply asked
to assess the progress of democratic reforms he has introduced since
his inauguration 13 months ago.
   May people think the reforms, which have included greater press
freedom, are insufficient.

<HEAD>Inquiry Blames Weather for Crash of Fighter Prototype</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government inquiry said today sudden
weather changes and problems with the flight control system caused
the crash of the first JAS 39 Gripen, Sweden's new combat plane.
   The Feb. 2 crash came at a time when the government already was
reconsidering the $5.5 billion plane _ the country's biggest defense
project _ because of delays and escalating costs. The pilot suffered
a broken arm.
   The industrial Group JAS, a consortium of Swedish companies, is
under contract to start deliveries to the air force in 1992. The
jets will replace aging Viggen planes.
   Rune Lundin, a member of the commission that investigated the
crash, told a news conference the prototype was known to have an
oversensitive flight control system, which is regulated by computers.
   He said computer software had not been adjusted before the crash
but that test pilots were instructed to compensate for the
sensitivity with the control stick.
   However, the weather worsened during flight, with winds exceeding
the approved limit. The commission said gusts of wind reached 28 mph
instead of 22 mph as predicted.
   Defense Minister Roine Carlsson said he was waiting for a more
extensive inquiry, due by the end of May, before he would comment on
the future of the project.

   ``This would be a good quiz,'' David Letterman
said at the top of his show. ``Find the Republican in the band.''
   It wasn't hard to find the button-down cat in back in the blue
blazer and red tie wailing out on ``Soul Man'' _ Lee Atwater,
Republican Party chairman and rock-blues guitar player.
   Atwater was the musical guest Tuesday night on NBC's ``Late Night
with David Letterman,'' sitting in with Paul Shaffer and the World's
Most Dangerous Band.
   ``Any musician in America would give their right arm to play with
this band,'' Atwater said after the taping. ``Paul's band is the
most respected band in the country. It's a musician's band.''
   ``That's a non-partisan comment,'' added Shaffer.
   ``Well, music is non-partisan,'' said Atwater. ``Music and
musicians are a world in their own, so there was no politics here
tonight, just good music.''
   Maybe just a little bit of politics. While Atwater stood in the
background, Letterman delivered his monologue, including one last
joke on John Tower, whose nomination as secretary of defense was
rejected last week by the Senate.
   ``Does (President) George Bush know you're here?'' Letterman
asked Atwater.
   ``Of course,'' said Atwater.
   ``Does he mind?'' queried Letterman.
   ``That's another question,'' replied Atwater.
   It wasn't Atwater's first big gig. On Jan. 21, he helped put a
hard-rocking finish to a weekend of inaugural parties by jamming
with a stage full of rock 'n' roll legends, including Ron Wood, Sam
Moore and Joe Cocker.
   On Tuesday night, Atwater was billed after Chevy Chase, Rita
Rudner and Caren Callahan, the national championship grocery bagger.
And, he was almost eclipsed by the shrieks emitted by the
participants of Exotic Bird Night in the Control Room.
   But, ``The cat can groove, if you want a quote, that's my
quote,'' Shaffer pronounced after the show.
   Shaffer said a couple of the show's writers who had seen Atwater
play thought it would be ``a hip idea'' to have him on.
   Atwater said he did not regret going into politics instead of
music.
   ``I'd be at the Holiday Inn making $65 a night still, A, and B,
I'd have never made it here on this stage if I'd-a stuck with
music.''
   ``I don't know about that,'' said Shaffer.

<HEAD>Jewish Settlers Establish New West Bank Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KARIN LAUB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers moved tractors and mobile homes
to a West Bank hilltop today, starting the first new settlement in
the occupied territories since the November elections.
   The settlement started the same day that Israel withdrew from the
Red Sea resort of Taba, handing sovereignty over to Egypt after
seven years of squabbling.
   Uri Ariel, head of the West Bank settlement council, said the
West Bank construction work was Israel's response to the withdrawal
from Taba.
   ``It's a good start that we are building a settlement in the land
of Israel,'' Ariel said on Israel radio. ``Maybe it's also a special
day when they are folding the (Israeli) flag in Taba.''
   However, there was opposition to the settlement in Israel's
divided government.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, three Palestinians, including a
9-year-old boy, were shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli
troops, Arab hospital officials said. The army said it was checking
the report.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army arrested Palestinians
suspected of killing two Palestinian hospital workers who cooperated
with Israel, an army spokesman said. He identified the leader of the
hit squad as a member of Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction headed by
Yasser Arafat.
   During house searches, troops confiscated a submachine gun, seven
handguns and a typewriter used to write threatening letters to
people who allegedly collaborate with the occupation government, the
spokesman said.
   Israeli officials have said attacks by Palestinians against
collaborators are in violation of Arafat's pledge that the Palestine
Liberation Organization has abandoned terror.
   At least 396 Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed since
the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied
territories broke out Dec. 8, 1987.
   Tractors today plowed a hilltop northwest of the West Bank town
of Ramallah to prepare the proposed settlement of Talmon, said
Yehuda Hasani, a settler spokesman.
   Three mobile homes later moved to the site despite heavy rain,
hail and fog. Hasani said 15 families were expected to move to
Talmon within a few days.
   Ariel said settlers had received all necessary government permits
to build the settlement.
   The government, a coalition of the right-wing Likud bloc and the
left-leaning Labor Party, has authorized the construction of eight
settlements during its four-year term, which expires in 1992. The
settlements include Talmon.
   Housing Ministry spokesman Amos Hadad said about 80,000 Jewish
settlers live in 103 settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the territories, which Israel
took from Egypt and Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war.
   The last settlement was started just before the Parliament
elections in November 1988.

<HEAD>Female Soldier Sues To Stay With Daughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soldier is suing to keep the Army from
sending her to South Korea and separating her from her infant
daughter.
   ``Having a child was one of the most important decisions I have
made,'' Spec. 4 Cheryl Beekman of Newport News said in the lawsuit
filed Tuesday in federal court. ``I did not give birth to her so I
could have someone else raise her.''
   Unless a judge blocks the transfer, Ms. Beekman must report to
South Korea on March 23 and find someone to care for her 6-month-old
daughter, Lauren.
   Ms. Beekman's husband, Chris, left Virginia in October to take a
job in Tacoma, Wash., where the family hopes to settle. She moved in
with a friend.
   Ms. Beekman said in the lawsuit that she recognized soon after
her daughter's birth that she would have a hard time balancing
motherhood and life as a soldier.
   Col. David A. Whaley, Ms. Beekman's group commander, overruled
recommendations from her superiors and an Army chaplain that she be
discharged, saying in a letter that a soldier should anticipate
moves and long deployments.
   No hearing on Ms. Beekman's case has been set.
   ``Obviously, she's not going to refuse to go if they deny this,''
said her attorney, Kenneth E. Labowitz.
   Ms. Beekman, 21, could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Whaley
did not return calls to his office.
   Ms. Beekman enlisted 2{ years ago and has been working at Fort
Eustis as a graphics illustrator.
   During her pregnancy, Army officials asked whether she wanted a
discharge. Under military law, she had a right to one if she wanted
it at that time, Labowitz said. But Ms. Beekman decided to try to
raise her daughter and finish her stint in the service.
   Labowitz said his client, who has 1{ years left to serve,
``didn't know what she was getting into.''

<HEAD>Taiwan To Allow Return of Stranded Soldiers In China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today announced that
hundreds of Taiwanese soldiers stranded on mainland China in the
1949 civil war can return home.
   ``The new policy is based on humanitarian considerations and a
response to calls from the public,'' Interior Minister Hsu Shui-teh
said.
   Applications for permanent residency will be accepted from the
stranded soldiers and their families beginning March 31, he said.
   The new policy marks the latest relaxation of the Nationalist
government ban on travel between China and Taiwan.
   The Nationalists, who fled to this island after losing the civil
war, had sent 10,000 Taiwanese to the Chinese mainland to help fight
the communists.
   Taiwan authorities believe about 1,400 of the soldiers are living
in China. Hsu said the Defense Ministry has verified names of 455
former Nationalist soldiers eligible to return to the island.
   Under the new policy, stranded Taiwanese soldiers, their spouses
and children under age 18 can apply to live in Taiwan, Hsu said.
However, stranded soldiers who joined the Chinese Communist Party
will have to publicly renounce their membership by placing an
advertisement in a newspaper, he said.

through Tuesday's playing of the tape that he told authorities he
made to scare his wife.
   The outburst prompted Judge Gary Carlson to order one of several
brief recesses in the sanity phase of Weber's trial, which was to
continue today.
   The jury is considering whether Weber was sane and can be held
responsible for the 1986 slaying of Carla Lenz, his 17-year-old
sister-in-law, and the attempted murder of his wife on Sept. 3.
   Weber put his hands over his ears and sobbed Tuesday as the
cassette tape that investigators found in his car was played for the
jury.
   When the male voice on the tape described cutting the calf off
the dead girl and later eating it, a juror put her hand to her mouth
and began crying. The judge called an immediate recess and the jury
left the courtroom.
   The jury had heard an edited version of the tape, without
references to cannibalism and a feeling of being two persons, during
the first part of the trial. At that time, Weber was not in the
courtroom, and the jurors sat expressionless.
   Weber was convicted Monday of mutilating and sexually assaulting
Miss Lenz. He had pleaded guilty to murdering the teen-ager and
attempting to murder his wife. But he also pleaded innocent by
reason of mental disease or defect to all charges.
   Defense attorney John Reid told the jury he wanted them to hear
the whole tape ``as difficult as that is'' so they could better
judge Weber's mind.
   If a jury decides Weber could not control his actions because of
mental illness, he will be committed for treatment, with any
possible release to be determined by a court.
   If he is found sane, he will be sent to prison, where he faces a
maximum sentence of life plus more than 250 years.
   The defense described Weber as a loner and bedwetter whose
problems were diagnosed by two psychiatrists as a disorder of sexual
sadism.
   Weber was accused of torturing Miss Lenz with a lighted
cigarette, pins and wooden wheelbarrow handles. He was accused of
using a lighted cigar, safety pin and wheelbarrow handle to assault
his 22-year-old wife before beating her with a shovel.

   Fred Du Plessis, chairman of
one of South Africa's largest insurance companies and an economic
adviser to the government, died in a car crash early today, his
company said. He was 57.
   Du Plessis was to have delivered the main address today at the

   Police said Du Plessis was driving alone in a car east of Cape
Town when his car and another vehicle collided at a highway exit.
The man driving the other car was hospitalized with injuries.
   Du Plessis, of the coastal town of Somerset West east of Cape

   Two Transit Authority police officers face up to
71 years in prison each for arresting people on trumped-up charges
on the subways.
   A federal jury Tuesday convicted Officers Alphonse Iannacone, 42,
an 18-year veteran, and Mary McDermott, 32, a member of the force
since 1980, of conspiracy and deprivation of civil rights after
three days of deliberations.
   Shouts of ``Oh no!'' and ``How could they do this?'' came from
sobbing spectators, including the officers' mothers, as the verdict
was read.
   Sentencing was set for May 10.
   The charges stemmed from a series of arrests the officers made in
1983 and 1984 while on plainclothes duty.
   Prosecutors said the officers were trying to improve their arrest
records to advance their careers. Defense attorneys said the
officers had no motive to fabricate crimes, since thousands of real
thefts and assaults occur in the subways every year.
   ``It's really hard for a police officer to get a fair trial,''
said defense attorney Barry Agulnick. He and the other defense
lawyer, Kenneth Kaplan, said they would appeal.
   Federal prosecutors called more than 20 witnesses, including the
eight men arrested by Iannacone and McDermott and the eight
``victims'' of the men.
   The men _ all of whom were black, Hispanic or Asian _ described
how they were taken off subway trains, arrested, handcuffed and
detained on charges of either sexual abuse or attempted grand
larceny.
   The alleged victims _ seven women and one man _ described their
shock when they learned they were listed as the complainants in the
cases against the men. The women said they had not sought police
assistance and had not felt anyone touching them in a lewd way. The
man said he was not a pickpocket victim.
   The defense called just two witnesses. A transit police
lieutenant explained that discrepancies between arresting officers'
notes and those of the prosecutor are not uncommon.
   A clinical psychologist testified that victims of sex abuse often
deny it occurred.
   Transit Police Chief Vincent Del Castillo said in a statement,
``While we can never be pleased by the conviction of any police
officers, we are pleased that this old and lingering issue has
finally been resolved.''

<TEXT>
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, a conservative Republican
known for his ethics campaign against House Speaker Jim Wright, is
claiming the front-runner's position in the intra-party battle for
the No. 2 spot in the House GOP leadership.
   Gingrich, a six-term Georgia congressman, said Tuesday he has
commitments from 70 House Republicans for the minority whip position
and another 22 have indicated they're leaning in his direction.
   ``We're gaining ground,'' said Gingrich, who said he has talked
with more than 100 Republican congressmen since Friday, when
President Bush nominated the current GOP whip, Rep. Dick Cheney of
Wyoming, for secretary of defense.
   Provided that Cheney is confirmed by the Senate for the defense
post, his successor as whip will be chosen by the 175 House
Republicans.
   Gingrich and Rep. Ed Madigan, R-Ill., are the only announced
candidates. Rep. Jerry Lewis, R-Calif., chairman of the House
Republican Conference, the No. 3 GOP leadership spot, also has
considered entering the race.
   Madigan, in a letter sent Monday to his GOP colleagues, said he
would ``maximize cooperation'' with Minority Leader Robert Michel,
R-Ill., and help President Bush press his legislative agenda.
   Gingrich, leader of a band of several dozen arch-conservatives,
has been the chief accuser of Wright over several alleged ethics
violations.
   Gingrich said Tuesday he was running a ``positive campaign'' and
added, ``It is my intention to be the whip who works with Bob Michel
and who works to make Bob Michel speaker.''

   A grand jury has decided to bring no criminal
charges in the cyanide-poisoning death of a teen-ager, the
prosecutor's office says
   The panel found ``nobody culpable at this point,'' George Kerns,
a spokesman for Camden County Prosecutor Samuel Asbell, said
Tuesday. ``As far as we're concerned, it's finished.''
   The panel began hearing testimony last month to determine whether
Thomas Lee, 17, of Haddonfield, died as a result of random product
tampering, homicide or suicide. Law officers have said evidence
pointed strongly toward suicide.
   Lee lapsed into a coma Jan. 3 after eating cyanide-laced Breyer's
black cherry yogurt. He died Feb. 7 after being removed from
life-support equipment.
   The grand jury heard from 20 witnesses, including the youth's
classmates, medical experts, a homicide investigator and the
teen-ager's parents, Hsin-Yi and Frances Lee, who testified
voluntarily before the panel Tuesday.
   The panel did not present a formal report of its findings, Kerns
said.
   Dennis Wixted, first assistant county prosecutor, said the panel
reached several conclusions, which he would not discuss.

<TEXT>
   Two teen-age Arab guerrillas crossed the
Egyptian border today and attacked an Israeli military outpost in
the occupied Gaza Strip with rifles and hand grenades, the army
said. The guerrillas were captured and wounded.
   A military source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 3
a.m. attack failed when a grenade hurled at the Israeli camp rolled
back onto the guerrillas' position and exploded, injuring the two
Arabs. Soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion.
   No Israeli soldiers were hurt. The attack came on the day Israel
withdrew from the Red Sea resort of Taba and handed sovereignty to
Egypt.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southern command,
said the guerrillas belong to a fundamentalist group known as Jihad
Islami, or Islamic Holy War.
   The guerrillas, aged 15 and 17, carried Soviet-made automatic
AK-47 rifles, a Swedish-made Karl Gustav submachine gun and six
Soviet F1 hand grenades, the army said. It said the teen-agers were
from the Canada Palestinian refugee camp in Egypt.
   Sources who demanded anonymity said a third person, perhaps
acting as a scout, slipped back across the border and avoided
capture.
   Mordechai said the attack was carried out with the knowledge of
PLO chief Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrillas.
   ``To the best of our knowledge, the ring was prepared and trained
in the Canada refugee camp in Egyptian Rafah and from there they
went with a scout to our territory,'' he said.
   ``According to the terrorists being questioned, the ring acted
and was sent by Jihad Islami. (They went) with the knowledge of
Fatah, and with the knowledge of Abu Ammar (Arafat).''
   Israel radio said the goal of the guerrillas was to kill
soldiers, take hostages and return to Egypt. The guerrillas were
promised $20,000 for making the attack, it claimed.
   The last infiltration from Egypt came on Dec. 29, when Israeli
soldiers shot and killed three men who crossed the border. It was
not known if the infiltrators were smugglers or guerrillas.
   In March 1988, three Palestinians crossed the Egyptian border and
hijacked a bus. They killed three Israeli civilians before they were
shot to death. The PLO's Force 17 unit claimed responsibility.
   Today's infiltration came amid reported efforts by U.S. officials
to work out a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization to stop infiltrations from Lebanon.
   Army officials estimate about 30 guerrillas have been killed in
south Lebanon during infiltration attempts since the beginning of
the year.
   The United States has asked the PLO to halt such attacks. But the
PLO said attacks on military targets were not included when Arafat
renounced terrorism last December.

<HEAD>Settlement Reached To Avert Philly Transit Stike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A last-minute settlement averted what would
have been the fifth transit strike in 12 years today for some
400,000 commuters.
   The Philadelphia-area transit authority and its biggest union
reached the tentative agreement Tuesday, minutes before the midnight
strike deadline.
   A walkout would have idled 5,200 union members who run
Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority buses, trolleys
and subways. SEPTA's regional rail lines would have continued
running with expanded routes.
   ``It was a tough, tough negotiation,'' SEPTA General Manager
Louis J. Gambaccini said. ``I would like to say that the union has
been admirable in its seriousness in its approach and we tried to
respect that.''
   Roger Tauss, president of Local 234 of the Transport Workers
Union, said he was very happy with the agreement.
   Gambaccini and Tauss refused to disclose terms of the agreement
until a union membership meeting today.
   But union officials who declined to be identified said the
three-year contract calls for a 16{ percent raise. The top hourly
wage is now $12.23.
   The agreement also calls for a pension increase and retains the
arrangement of SEPTA paying the entire cost of the workers'
health-care coverage, according to sources.

<TEXT>
   Parliament today passed the country's
budget for the 1989 fiscal year after a three-month dispute over the
size of defense expenditures, the official Tanjug news agency
reported.
   It said that because of inflation the federal budget of $3
billion was 165 percent higher than last year's figure. The
government says the annual inflation rate recently rose to a record
346 percent.
   Yugoslavia's federal budget covers only outlays on defense, aid
to underdeveloped regions, government salaries and retirement
benefits.
   All other expenditures are covered by the individual budgets of
the country's six member republics.
   The spending plan devotes $2 billion, or 4.9 percent of the gross
national product, for the military, Tanjug said. A proposal to spend
5.2 percent of the GNP on defense was defeated after it was opposed
by Slovenia, the nation's most liberal and economically developed
republic.
   The Communist Party in Slovenia and independent groups who want
the role of the army scaled down led the fight for a lower military
budget, saying defense spending was taking up too many scarce
resources.

<HEAD>Tabloids Rap Yorks' Pay Increase</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   London's tabloid newspapers today criticized the 79
percent pay raise granted the Duke and Duchess of York in the
government's new budget.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said Tuesday the couple
will receive state income of nearly $266,000 for the fiscal year
beginning April 1, up from $148,000 this year.
   It is the second year in a row that Andrew _ Queen Elizabeth II's
second son _ and his wife, the former Sarah Ferguson, received
larger increases than other members of the royal family.
   ``That's Rich!'' said the headline in The Daily Express. ``This
is the second year running the couple have hit the jackpot.''
   ``Young Yorks Rise Is 10 Times Rate Of Inflation,'' said Today.
   ``69,000 For Andy (And Nigel Gives The Rest Of Us Just 4.35 A
Week),'' said The Sun, Britain's largest circulating newspaper.
   The other members of the royal family received a 4.6 percent
raise, lower than the annual inflation rate of 7.5 percent. The
increases raised the family's direct cost to the nation to
$10,594,000.
   The queen and her 10 closest relatives receive funds annually
from the Civil List section of the budget. The money, payment for
carrying out official duties such as receiving ambassadors,
presenting awards and foreign tours, goes mostly toward staff
salaries and household expenses.
   The treasury said the raise for the Duke and Duchess of York will
pay for their office at Buckingham Palace. The office has been
funded by savings from Andrew's past Civil List entitlements, but
that money has run out, the treasury said.
   Andrew also receives nearly $36,000 plus allowances for his job
as a lieutenant in the Royal Navy.
   Andrew and Sarah have been criticized for taking too many
holidays and carrying out too few public engagements. Harold
Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, predicted they
would be much busier this year.
   ``No member of the royal family has an increased income from the
Civil List unless it is believed that he or she will receive many
more duties in the future,'' Brooks-Baker said.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines pilots, accusing Chairman Frank Lorenzo of
``gross mismanagement and incompetence,'' has asked a bankruptcy
judge to appoint an independent trustee to run the strike-crippled
carrier.
   The request Tuesday by the Air Line Pilots Association coincided
with the union's approval of $2,400-a-month strike pay for the 3,600
pilots, who were bolstered by a federal appeals court's refusal to
force them back to work.
   In papers filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York, the pilots
charged that Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern parent Texas Air Corp.,
intends to dismantle Eastern.
   The New York Times reported today that Lorenzo has asked Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., Eastern's regular investment banker, to
determine what interest there may be among investors and other
airlines in buying Eastern. Texas Air had weighed the possible sale
of Eastern even before the strike.
   The idea of selling Eastern was raised at a Texas Air board
meeting last week, the Times reported.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said he could not immediately
comment on the report and Texas Air's public relations office was
not open early today.
   In other developments in the 12-day-old strike by the airline's
8,500-member Machinist union:
   _ A U.S. House vote was expected today on a proposal to put
striking workers back on the job while a federal review panel
studies the 17-month-old contract stalemate. But the legislation,
even if passed, isn't given much chance of surviving a presidential
veto.
   _ The airline, which struggled to run less than 10 percent of its
pre-strike schedule, won bankruptcy court approval Tuesday for a
plan to help ticket holders grounded by the walkout.
   _ In a show of support with Eastern pilots, the pilots union
announced its 41,000 members at 47 airlines will be assessed $300
each to help pay for the strike benefits. The union also agreed to
refuse to fly planes and routes purchased from Eastern unless
Eastern pilots are hired for the work.
   _ The Machinists, whose strike began March 4 when they refused to
accept $125 million in concessions, asked the bankruptcy court to
free $8 million in paychecks due last Friday and $1 million in
insurance premiums.
   It is not known when U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland will
rule on the request for a trustee.
   The pilots' charge that Lorenzo is dismantling Eastern is based
in part on his tentative deal to sell its profitable Northeast
shuttle to developer Donald Trump for $365 million.
   ``Lorenzo's stripping of Eastern's valuable assets constitutes,
at a minimum, gross mismanagement and incompetence,'' the pilots
union said.
   The charge was denied by the Miami-based carrier, which filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday.
   ``The intention is to keep the airline flying,'' said Eastern
spokesman Art Kent. ``That is the point. We have said that, if
necessary, assets will be sold to maintain liquidity.''
   With Eastern ticket holders clamoring for refunds, the carrier
announced an estimated $200 million compensation package that
provides for some first-class upgrades and travel vouchers.
   Under the plan, which won Lifland's approval, tickets and
reservations frozen by the bankruptcy filing will be accepted and
most travelers will receive first-class seats. Those holding tickets
for routes canceled by Eastern can exchange for travel credits on
Eastern's present flights. Otherwise, ticket holders can wait until
Eastern resumes operation on the original route and take a companion
at half price.
   Its sister airline, Continental, will continue to honor Eastern
tickets as ``Eastern continues to work with other airlines to help
establish policies for acceptance of Eastern tickets,'' the company
said in a statement.
   In other developments:
   _ At a rally in Miami, Mary Jane Barry, president of the
Transport Workers Union local representing flight attendants, told a
crowd of 750 that an anti-Continental campaign would begin Thursday
in Denver, one of the carrier's hubs. She would not elaborate.
   _ In Atlanta, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals refused to
force the pilots back to work but set a March 23 hearing in
Tallahassee, Fla., for a three-judge panel to review the airline's
request for such action.
   _ Several major domestic carriers have asked a U.S. District
Court judge in Washington to issue a permanent ban on sympathy
strikes by machinists. A ruling was expected this week.
   _ Federal courts continued to block attempts by union leaders to
organize rail worker strikes in New York and Philadelphia.
   _ Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis threw his support to
strikers at a rally attended by 1,000 Eastern machinists and
sympathizers at a rally in Boston.

   A tourist arriving at Kennedy International
Airport has a 66 percent chance of being overcharged for a cab ride
into Manhattan, an undercover investigation by the Taxi and
Limousine Commission found.
   A dozen inspectors posed as tourists arriving at the airport on
evening flights March 6-10 and took cabs to a hotel in lower
Manhattan.
   In eight cases, the commission said Tuesday, the drivers took a
circuitous route that raised the usual fare of $29 to as much as
$40.75.
   The weeklong probe yielded 445 summonses for traffic violations,
fare refusals and overcharges.
   Eleven hack licenses, two meters and two taxi medallions were
confiscated and one driver was arrested for obstructing justice and
assaulting an officer.
   The inspectors found two taxis fitted with ``zappers'' that
secretly speed up the meter. The drivers' licenses were suspended

   Thousands of people dressed in national
colors and pre-Communist coats of arms jammed a Budapest square
today to support calls for freedom on the anniversary of Hungary's
1848 revolt against Austria.
   For the first time in 41 years, the anniversary of the
months-long revolution was a legal public holiday, a symbol of
Hungary's increasingly independent course and democratic reforms.
   Many used the day off to go shopping in neighboring Austria for
the electronic gadgets and other goods that are in short supply in
Hungary.
   But thousands more massed at Communist Party gatherings and
independent rallies. Calls for a neutral, independent Hungary and
criticism of the Soviet Union punctuated today's rallies.
   About 50,000 people at a rally in Budapest applauded a call from
independent groups for more rights and freedom.
   ``Not only should March 15 be a day of freedom, but the 16th,
17th 18th and all the other days of the year,'' declared Denes
Csengey, a leader of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, one of the
largest of Hungary's new independent groups.
   Shouts of ``We demand! We demand!'' rang out as speakers read a
proposal for free elections, disbanding of paramilitary police
forces and the creation of a national holiday on Oct. 23 _ the start
of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt.
   Today's ceremonies began with an official wreathlaying and a
party rally outside the National Museum.
   For the first time, Communist Party speakers such as leading
Communist reformer Reszoe Nyers shared the rostrum with leaders from
the Social Democrats and the Smallholders' Party, two parties formed
recently.
   Nyers won applause from the crowd of 60,000 when he said that
Hungarian policy from 1948 to 1956 was largely steered by the
Kremlin.
   He also charged that under the leadership of Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev, an ``anti-reform spirit'' blew from Moscow across
eastern Europe and choked Hungarian reforms.
   After the official rally, about 40,000 people converged on a
monument to Sandor Petoefi, the firebrand poet of the short-lived
1848 revolt, to hear speakers from independent groups.
   Although reforms have legalized the new independent groups, and
the Communist Party has agreed in principle to a multiparty system,
Hungarian activists are pressing for more freedom and greater
independence within the Soviet bloc.
   During today's rally, a banner reading ``Independent Hungary,''
fluttered on a nearby bridge. Another huge banner with the words,
``56, 68, 81'' and the national flags of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and
Poland recalled the violent suppression of reforms in those
countries in those years.
   The March 15 anniversary has been an occasion for anti-Communist
rallies by dissidents and unofficial groups since the early 1970s.
   In 1986, riot police brutally dispersed crowds who took part in
that year's rally, and last year eight leading dissidents were
detained on the anniversary and police broke up an evening march.
   This year, the official dailies published the schedule of the
independent groups. Police helicopters occasionally buzzed over
demonstrators, but there was no police interference.

   Life expectancy of white Americans continues to
increase while that of blacks declines, and other significant health
differences between Caucasians and minorities remain, according to
government statistics released today.
   The figures, contained in an annual Public Health Service report,
show that blacks are dying younger than whites, blacks are twice as
likely to die in infancy as whites and substantially fewer black
women who are pregnant receive early prenatal care.
   ``The report shows, as have others for as long as they have been
issued, that there is a disparity between the health of our white
and black populations,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan.
   The report is a compilation of statistics previously released by
the National Center for Health Statistics, which is part of the
health service. It is based on figures for the years 1970 through
1986, the latest year for which comprehensive data is available.
   While life expectancy at birth for whites increased from 75.3
years in 1985 to 75.4 in 1986, life expectancy for blacks declined
from 69.5 to 69.4 during the period, the report said. For all
Americans, life expectancy was 74.8 in 1986, up from 74.7 the year
before.
   For whites and the overall population, the figures were the same
in 1984 as in 1985, but for blacks the 1986 decline in life
expectency followed a similar one in 1985, when it was 69.7, which
Sullivan called ``a disturbing trend.''
   The report said the life-span declines among blacks were the
result of increases in deaths from AIDS, homicides, influenza and
pneumonia.
   ``I think the basic things related to nutrition, poverty, access
to (health) care affect a wide variety of conditions from infant
mortality to mortality at later ages and also is probably related to
mortality from drug-related violence,'' said Dr. Manning Feinleib,
director of the National Center for Health Statistics.
   Among the report's other findings:
   _Live births to unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to
1986, from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births. In 1986, 11
percent of women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who gave
birth were unmarried, compared with 16 percent of white women, 42
percent of American Indian women and 61 percent of black women.
   _Between 1970 and 1986, deaths from heart disease declined by 31
percent, although it remains the leading cause of death in America.
During the same period, death from stroke, the third-leading cause,
dropped by 53 percent. Declines in smoking are believed to be the
reason for the declines.
   _Accidents, including motor vehicle accidents, were the
fourth-leading cause of death in the country in 1986 and the most
frequent cause of death before age 65 among males.
   _Although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death, it
takes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black males
who die before they are 65.
   ``These data point us in the direction of expanding our agenda in
the upcoming decade to include a greater focus on such critical
health areas as prevention of AIDS, unintentional injuries, homicide
and suicide _ many of which demand individual and societal
behavioral change,'' Sullivan said at a news briefing on the report.

   Right on schedule, the buzzards returned to
Hinckley today, renewing a 150-year tradition.
   Three of the birds arrived at the town buzzard's roost at 6:32
a.m. with Metroparks Ranger Capt. Roger Lutz on hand to record the
event.
   Buzzard spotting each March 15 in Hinckley has become an annual
sign of spring in northeast Ohio.
   Lutz said a flock of about 80 buzzards migrates to the park in
the small town 20 miles from Cleveland. The migration route of the
scavenger birds remains a mystery.
   Legend has it the buzzards were first attracted to Hinckley in
1819 when a March thaw exposed the carcasses of predatory animals
that had been killed by residents the previous December during their
Great Hinckley Varmint Hunt.

   Air Force investigators looking into a
helicopter crash that killed 15 servicemen are considering factors
such as weather, maintenance and weight but have ruled out a suspect
rotor fastener, a spokesman said.
   The CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter, carrying 11 Green
Berets engaged in desert training and four Air Force crewmen,
crashed Sunday night in the desert 25 miles from Davis-Monthan Air
Force Base.
   Capt. Carlos Roque, a Davis-Monthan spokesman, said Tuesday that
use of night-vision goggles, which have been implicated in numerous
military helicopter crashes, have been eliminated as a possible
cause.
   Investigators also ruled out the main rotor shaft nut, a fastener
about a foot in diameter that holds the main rotor head to the
helicopter frame, Maj. Fran Turnstall said.
   It had been checked two days before the crash as part of a
program to inspect more than 300 CH-3Es and similar helicopters
belonging to the Air Force, Navy and Coast Guard for defective nuts,
spokesmen said.
   Turnstall said it was removed, inspected and found to be
adequate. But another Pentagon spokesmen, Air Force Lt. Col. Darrel
Hayes, said the nut had been replaced Friday.
   After the crash, the nut was found in place, ruling out the
possibility it disengaged and allowed the rotor blades to strike the
aircraft, Turnstall said.
   Roque said that while other maintenance issues, weather and the
loading of the helicopter were studied, the five remaining CH-3Es
belonging to the 71st Special Operations Command at Davis-Monthan
remained out of service Tuesday.
   ``At some point, they will be permitted to fly again, after
something is done, probably an inspection or a changeover of some
sort, or whatever the investigators recommend,'' Roque said.

   A religious weekly will include cans of sardines

only for wrapping fish.
   The sardines will appear in some April 7 editions of Michigan
Catholic, the Archdiocese of Detroit paper, Editor Alfred Doblin

   ``I'm just using a commonly held belief and getting a little joke

   Students at Sacred Heart Seminary will help stuff the cans into

   ``It's a neat tie-in with the old concept of wrapping fish in
newspaper and with Catholics eating fish,'' said Jay Berman, an
archdiocese spokesman. ``I hope it works.''

   More businesses opened and buses
operated today, but 1 million Rio de Janerio commuters were stranded
in the second and final day of a nationwide strike to protest a
government-imposed wage freeze.
   Scattered violence was reported.
   The subway operated normally in Sao Paulo, South America's
biggest city with 10 million people, and commuters jammed more than
1,300 privately owned buses on the streets. However, about 4,000
government-owned buses were stopped.
   Pro-strike demonstrators tried to stop some of the privately
owned buses from leaving garages. Police said 30 buses were damaged
by rock-throwers Wednesday and 23 people were arrested.
   Among those arrested was a Franciscan friar ``who was carrying a
slingshot and several marbles apparently to damage buses,''
according to Jairo Pires, a spokesman for the Sao Paulo State
Security Department.
   In Rio, privately owned buses started circulating today, and more
banks, stores, coffee shops, department stores and supermarkets
opened their doors in both cities.
   However, Rio's subway and commuter trains remained idle for a
second day today, stranding about 1 million commuters.
   The Jornal do Brasil radio station reported three bus passengers
today opened fire and wounded two pickets who tried to stop the bus
on Rio's poor north side.
   ``The strike is clearly petering out, and everything indicates a
majority of the state's factory workers will be at their jobs,''
said Luis Carlos Granadero, a spokesman for the Federation of
Industries in Sao Paulo state.
   Sergio dos Santos of the national strike command acknowledged the
strike was not attracting support in Sao Paulo, ``but we hope to
reverse this trend.'' He said the strike command still did not have
information on the strike elsewhere in the country.
   The two-day strike was organized by Brazil's two largest labor
movements, the radical left Central Workers Union and the more
moderate General Workers Central, which claim to represent 35
million of Brazil's 60 million workers.
   President Jose Sarney's spokesman, Carlso Henrique de Almeida
Santos, told reporters in the capital of Brasilia that the strike
caused ``isolated work stoppages'' Wednesday in many cities ``but in
no way can it be considered a general strike.''
   On Wednesday, international and domestic airlines flew on normal
schedules. Supermarkets, gas stations, small shops across Latin
America's largest country also opened their doors.
   The strike was called to protest the wage freeze that formed part
of the government's Jan. 15 austerity plan. The economic package cut
government spending and froze prices to control 1,000 percent
inflation.
   The plan brought inflation down from 28.7 percent a month in
December to 3.6 percent for the first 11 days of February, the
latest period for which the government has figures.
   Jair Meneguelli, president the Central Workers Union, said the
wage freeze had slashed workers purchasing power by up to 49 percent.
   More than half of Brazilian workers earn less than $50 a week.

   The Bush administration is considering several
options on the future of the American Embassy chancery in Moscow, a
U.S. official said today, including razing it and building a new one.
   The chancery is said to be riddled with eavesdropping devices and
has not been used.
   Among the options, said the official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, were:
   _ Razing the chancery and building a new one. That could cost an
estimated $500 million.
   _ Dismantling and rebuilding three stories and constructing an
annex for the most sensitive work, as suggested in a study by former
Defense Secretary James R. Schlesinger.
   _ Clearing the new embassy of eavesdropping devices, as
recommended by Anne Armstrong, head of former President Reagan's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.
   In the meantime, Nicholas M. Salgo, a former ambassador to
Hungary, was appointed last week to develop plans for facilities in
Moscow that meet U.S. security requirements.
   Salgo made similar studies in China, East Germany and Bulgaria.

   Pan Am warned passengers of a bomb threat received
prior to a trans-Atlantic flight this week, unlike in December when
the threat to Flight 103 was disclosed only to the government, a
newspaper reported today.
   However, the airline did not notify passengers until 15 minutes
after the delayed flight's scheduled departure time, leading to
complaints, The Boston Globe reported.
   ``Pan Am knew about it and did nothing to forewarn passengers and
give them an option until the last minute,'' passenger Marilyn
Harding told the newspaper in a telephone interview from Paris.
   She was one of about 17 passengers who changed travel
arrangements after the airline announced an anonymous telephone
caller claimed a bomb would be put on the flight Monday from New
York to Tel Aviv via Paris, the newspaper said.
   Most of the flight's 200 passengers apparently felt confident
that their plane would not meet the same fate as Pan Am Flight 103,
which exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, Dec. 21, killing all 259
passengers and 11 people on the ground.
   ``I left,'' Harding said. ``Who wants to spend eight hours up
there just wondering? I think those people took a real gamble.''
   Pan Am spokesman Alan Loflin said that the aircraft, passengers
and their baggage all were carefully screened and that officials
were ``satisfied all appropriate measures had been taken'' when the
plane took off.
   Loflin told The Associated Press today he did not know whether
any airline ever had similarly notified passengers of a bomb threat.
   The flight arrived at its destination without incident.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., on Tuesday proposed legislation
that would force airlines to notify passengers of serious threats to
international flights.
   ``It's absolutely unconscionable that information regarding a
serious terrorist threat was selectively provided to government
officials and withheld from the passengers and flight crew of Pan Am
103,'' D'Amato said in a statement.

   The Soviets today accused a U.S. military attache
of spying and ordered him to leave the country in apparent
retaliation for Washington's expulsion last week of a Soviet officer.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Army Lt.
Col. Daniel Francis Van Gundy III, an assistant military attache at
the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, was given 48 hours to leave.
   Gerasimov said Van Gundy, who had been assigned to the embassy
for about two years, the normal Moscow diplomatic tour, was declared
unwelcome because he engaged in espionage.
   The 42-year-old Army officer lives on the U.S. Embassy compound
with his wife, Susan, and two of their three daughters.
   On Thursday, U.S. officials accused Soviet Lt. Col. Yuri N.
Pakhtusov of trying to buy computer secrets and ordered him to leave
the country. They did not say how long he had to leave.
   Gerasimov, at a hastily called briefing, charged that Van Gundy
attempted ``to enter a closed area, deliberately diverting from the
officially permitted route, clandestinely photographed military
sites and committed other gross violations'' of the rules of
diplomatic conduct.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Richard Gilbert said the Soviet charges
were ``unwarranted, inappropriate, without justification and
certainly in no way in keeping with the positive tone of the
U.S.-Soviet relationship.''
   Gilbert, the embassy press attache, suggested the Soviet action
was in retaliation for the U.S. expulsion of Pakhtusov.
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Anita Stockman called
the expulsion ``unwarranted.'' She said ``we are considering our
response,'' but declined to elaborate.
   Van Gundy refused to answer questions from reporters as he walked
to his office. He specifically refused comment on Gerasimov's
allegation that ``warnings had already been issued to the lieutenant
colonel.''
   Gerasimov said: ``The U.S. administration is revealing its
foreign policy, and we have this problem of spy mania.''
   He cited a recent Time magazine cover story on the 1987 Marine
spy scandal in Moscow and said there had been other attempts to
incite fears of espionage by unnamed American leaders uninterested
in improving U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We're not the ones who initiated this process,'' Gerasimov
said, tacitly acknowledging the connection between last week's
incident and the expulsion of Van Gundy.
   Using almost the same words Gilbert used to denounce today's
action, Gerasimov called the expulsion of Pakhtusov ``a provocation,
uncalled for and unjustified. It does not fit in with the trend for
the positive development of Soviet-American relations.''
   He called it ``an artificially cooked scenario clumsily carried
out by the FBI.''
   Pakhtusov was accused of receiving sensitive information about
how the U.S. government protects computer secrets. The State
Department said he was caught in a six-month FBI probe after he
approached an unidentified American employee of a firm that deals in
classified information.
   The Soviet government rejected the charge and accused the United
States of ``a deliberate provocation against a Soviet diplomatic
official.''
   The Soviets did not then announce any retaliatory action, but
Gerasimov had said ``In taking the decision to expel Pakhtusov .. .
the U.S. is assuming all responsibilities.''
   Pakhtusov, a military attache at the Soviet Embassy in
Washington, was ordered home after the FBI said it caught him
receiving sensitive information.
   A U.S. source alleged the 35-year-old Soviet was a member of GRU,
the Soviet military's intelligence arm.
   Over the years, when one superpower expelled a diplomat on spying
charges, the other nation has responded in kind.
   In October 1986, after 25 Soviet diplomats were ordered out of
the Soviet U.N. Mission in New York, the Kremlin expelled five
American diplomats.

Colorization</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Copyright Office today recommended that
Congress consider legislation protecting makers of future films from
unauthorized colorization of their work.
   The Patent and Trademark Office, in a report released at the same
time, recommended that no changes in the trademark law should be
made but left the door open to changes in copyright law.
   Both reports were requested by the subcommittee on copyright of
the House Judiciary Committee, which decided last year that no
change in copyright laws was needed.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., subcommittee chairman, promised
to review the reports carefully, and added, ``We must ask the
proponents of change to bear the burden of proving that the change
is necessary, fair and practical.''
   The suggested changes in law would not affect films already made.
   The Copyright Office urged the subcommittee to consider, before
anything else, a unified package of legislation covering not only
film artists, but also visual artists, such as painters and
sculptors. Such legislation would give them ``moral rights'' to bar
alteration of their work, such as colorization of films.
   The Copyright Office also said it could support a decision to
enact artists' rights legislation to film makers alone, if the
subcommittee chose to do this. If the subcommittee chooses this
approach, the office said, it should ``carefully consider whether
the existing web of collective and individual bargaining is adequate
to protect directors' legitimate interests.''
   ``The Copyright Office conclusion will, I know, be a
disappointment to some in the film industry who seek to maintain the
status quo,'' Kastenmaier said. ``It will likely be welcomed by
others who seek increased protection for artists.''
   Donald J. Quigg, commissioner of patents and trademarks, told the
subcommittee the trademark law should not be changed because it has
already been broadly interpreted.
   He added, ``We take position at this time on the desirability of
more extensive moral rights protection for American creative artists
than is available currently,'' saying only that if such a change is
made it should not be made in the trademark law.

<HEAD>Cambodian Refugees Cleared of Animal Cruelty Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed animal cruelty
charges against two Cambodian refugees who admitted killing a
4-month-old German shepherd for food.
   ``Under the facts, I don't believe it can be said that these
defendants inflicted unreasonable pain on the animal,'' Municipal
Judge Bradford L. Andrews said Tuesday. ``To hold otherwise would
subject every slaughterhouse employee or farmer to prosecution.''
   Andrews had ruled last week that killing a dog for food was not
illegal unless the dog was ``maimed, wounded, tortured, mutilated or
tormented'' in a manner beyond that required to prepare it as food.
   ``I am sympathetic to the feelings of those who champion the
cause of animal rights,'' Andrews said, ``but the remedy lies in
convincing the Legislature to enact laws that would make the actions
of these defendants unlawful.''
   Sokheng Chea, 32, and Seng Ou, 33, both of Long Beach, said they
killed the puppy in June by holding the dog down on the kitchen
floor, hitting it over the head with a blunt instrument and slashing
its throat before they began skinning it.
   Police, alerted by a neighbor who heard the dog's yelps, arrested
the men. They were charged with misdemeanors.
   ``I am happy,'' Ou, speaking through an interpreter, said of
Tuesday's ruling, ``but I can assure you that there will be no
second time.''
   Local Asian leaders said that dogs and cats are considered
delicacies in some Southeast Asian countries.
   Local animal rights activists said they were disappointed by the
outcome.
   ``I think that what these defendants did offends the
sensibilities of the community,'' said Wendy Aragon. ``There is a
need for legislation to outlaw the slaughter of dogs and cats; they
are companion animals, not food animals.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev called on the
Communist Party's top policy-making body today to take rapid steps
to ease chronic Soviet food shortages, but indicated their total
elimination would take years.
   His comments came at a two-day meeting of the 300-member Central
Committee.
   Before Gorbachev spoke, the official Tass news agency said, the
Central Committee elected its senior leaders, including Gorbachev,
to the nation's new parliament, the 2,250-seat Congress of People's
Deputies.
   Tass said Gorbachev today ``set the task, already in the nearest
future, of easing the acuteness of the food problem, and in the
first half of the '90s to guarantee the production of agricultural
products in sufficient quantity and variety for stable food supply.''
   Tass did not immediately provide details, but Gorbachev's wording
indicated the Kremlin leadership was resigned to continuing food
shortages in the next several years.
   Gorbachev called again for the ``development of lease
relations,'' and said one of the most important elements of his
program for economic reform was ``the restructuring of relations to
socialist property.''
   Gorbachev has said he wants to lease state-owned fields to
farmers, which he says will increase productivity because farmers
can earn more.
   In several recent appearances, Yegor K. Ligachev, who heads the
party's Commission on Agriculture, has disagreed with Gorbachev on
how to resolve the crisis. Ligachev has skipped lightly over
leasing, and instead emphasized collective farming _ the system that
has left Soviet consumers standing in line for meat and vegetables.
   No one has proposed allowing farmers to own the land they till or
breaking up the giant collective and state farms that have been the
backbone of the Soviet agricultural system since the days of Josef
Stalin.
   Whatever the decision on leasing, the Central Committee was
likely to agree on the need to ease the poverty and isolation of
rural life.
   It is also was expected to order the dismantling, at least
partially, of an agricultural superministry created in 1985.
   Along with the differences in emphasis in Gorbachev's and
Ligachev's recent remarks, there has been evidence in recent weeks
that the Kremlin leadership has found it difficult to agree on
agricultural reform.
   The Central Committee meeting on agriculture was originally
scheduled for February, then postponed.
   Last week, the 12-member Politburo's meeting covered agricultural
reform, among other items, and ran for two days instead of the usual
one.
   The Central Committee, which last met in January, also has the
power to change the membership of top party bodies like the
Politburo and Secretariat.
   For the new Congress of People's Deputies, the Communist Party is
one of 30 organizations that will choose a total of one-third of the
representatives.
   Despite the publicity touting this campaign as the Soviet Union's
first multicandidate election, the Communist Party chose to nominate
just 100 people for its 100 seats. Party members had suggested more
than 31,000 names. The deputies elected by the party in a secret
ballot include most members of the 12-man ruling Politburo, 26
workers and seven collective farmers, Tass said.

   Senate Republicans, and the Republican vice president of the
United States, Dan Quayle, have both charged partisan politics in
the Senate's refusal to confirm John Tower as secretary of defense.
   How unfortunately partisan that accusation sounds.
   If the shoe were on the other foot _ a Democrat in the White
House and the GOP in control of the Senate _ one would hope that an
equally second-rate candidate would be given the boot.
   Tower was not the right person for the job, not only because he
savored the sauce but also because he curried favor with the defense
industry.
   The Tower debate was not a question of political power. It was a
question of the lifestyle of a man in control of the nation's tanks
and missiles. And he came up short.

   The Brainerd (Minn.) Daily Dispatch on John Tower:
   To hear some Republicans react to the defeat of John Tower as
nominee for secretary of defense, you'd think the republic was
coming to an end.
   ``The partisan taste of this debate is going to linger,'' said
Sen. Robert Kasten, R-Wis. ``This is going to make it damn tough for
us to act in much of a bipartisan manner in the months ahead.''
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the setback will
stay in his memory.
   Fortunately, others had a clearer perspective that life goes on.
   Vice President Dan Quayle showed he is maturing in the job when
he said, ``We have a job ahead of us. We have an agenda ahead of us.
And we're going to need the help and cooperation of the Democratic
Congress.''
   On with the job, please.

   Delaware County Daily Times, Primos, Pa., on Bush and the
environment:
   President Bush charted an ambitious course of environmental
activism (Monday), promising to:
   _ Throw the book at ocean dumpers.
   _ Support aggressive criminal prosecution of those who damage the
environment.
   _ Submit legislation to reauthorize the Clean Air Act.
   _ Suggest new standards to reduce industrial emissions that cause
acid rain.
   _ Step up the Superfund cleanup program.
   _ Assure compliance with hazardous waste.
   Bush didn't say how he proposed to meet all his goals but he told
a group of state attorneys general that it was high time everyone
from the president on down got with the program ... before it's too
late.
   The prosecutors welcomed his resolve. There were a few ...,
however, who tempered their enthusiasm with old-fashioned
skepticism. Tom Miller, Iowa's attorney general, was one.
   ``I heard all the right words,'' Miller said. ``However, we have
to recognize that words are the easy part.''
   As long as the president and Miller's fellow attorneys general
also recognize ``words are the easy part of it,'' the environment
might have a chance after all.

   The Clarion-Ledger, Jackson, Miss., on terrorism:
   The FBI still is seeking clues and gathering evidence from last
Friday's bomb attack aimed at the family of the skipper of the USS
Vincennes. ...
   Since the Navy skipper, Will Rogers, commanded the missile
cruiser that mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian
Gulf last July, Iran is high on the suspect list.
   But whether it was Iran, one of any Iranian extremist faction,
another country or another group, response must be swift and severe.
The president should not shy away from a military strike in this
case.
   It is true that there is no sure defense against terrorism. But
it is also true that the best prevention is for outlaw nations and
groups to know that they will pay the price. That is the only
response terrorists understand.

   Chicago Tribune on Bush's slow start:
   George Bush is beginning to disappoint people who expected him to
take the presidential baton from Ronald Reagan and keep the
governmental relay race going full tilt.
   Instead, he is taking his time, sizing up the stadium and
examining the condition of the track before turning on the speed.
   Trouble is, other things aren't standing still. ...
   Yet the new administration, which has been slow to fill
sub-Cabinet posts and in no rush to articulate its priorities, has
seemd content with followership rather than leadership, sounding
tough only in its defense of John Tower and in its opposition to new
taxes.

   (Lee) Atwater demonstrated his political acumen by withdrawing

   Los Angeles Times on apartheid and religion:
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa has
found apartheid a ``sin'' four years after officially rejecting the
concept of racial segregation, a finding that will at least postpone
a formal break with the larger black and mixed-race branches of the
church.
   But the white branch has once again shied away from agreement on
tactics, such as civil disobedience, that have been proposed to
accelerate the glacial progress away from apartheid. ...
   (But) disillusionment has followed so many official rejections of
apartheid. The rejections have not been matched by substantial
progress toward reform.
   Apartheid is officially opposed by the government of South Africa
and by most political forces. Only the far-right Conservative Party,
which advocates firm restoration of racial segregation, remains
firmly committed to apartheid.

   The News-Review, Roseburg, Ore., on a youth service corps:
   A major test of whether a new social ethos is indeed emerging may
be the fate of proposals in Congress to establish a voluntary
national service. The concept is predicated on the belief that young
people can be motivated as much by altruism and civic obligation as
by the prospect of material gain. ...
   (Legislators) envision a corps of up to one million high school
graduates, age 18 to 26, who would volunteer to spend one or two
years performing community service, such as working in hospitals,
AIDS hospices, homeless shelters or child day-care centers.
   They would be paid only subsistence wages, about $100 a week. But
in exchange for their labors, they would be given education vouchers
worth $10,000 for each year of national service. ...
   The Citizens Corps would be ... a civilian GI Bill of Rights,
based on the sound premise of providing government benefits for
service rendered to the country.
   The idea dovetails nicely with George Bush's call to invigorate
``a thousand points of light'' in American society and at the same
time fosters a needed rebirth of American altruism.

   The Press, Atlantic City, N.J., on warring KKK factions:
   Pity the poor Ku Klux Kan. It has been defended many times over
the years, usually over its right to hold public rallies.
   Now the KKK wants lawyers to take its side once more. This time,
against the KKK.
   Richard Bondira, who calls himself the ``Grand Wizard'' of a
northern New Jersey chapter, says his group _ Invisible Empire,
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan _ is the real McCoy. Bondira says that
another group, which plans to hold a rally next month in Millville,
N.J., is an impostor. The other Klan group says that, no, it's the
real KKK.
   Bondira claims that he can't seem to find an attorney willing to
take his case. What a shame.
   It's a tribute to Americans ... when the Klan can have its day in
court ... without regard to its philosophy.
   Most Americans _ and most lawyers _ don't really give a hoot over
which group claims to be the real Ku Klux Klan. They wish both Klans
would simply go away. That's also a tribute of sorts.

   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on Soviet defense spending:
   According to the Soviet Union's published budget, the Kremlin's
defense spending this year will amount to about 20 billion rubles.
At the official rate of exchange, that is $10 billion, or $60
billion at the more realistic black market rate. The United States
defense budget approaches $300 billion.
   Thus Moscow's publicly declared defense budget is about one-tenth
of ours, but the Soviet Union maintains an army of 180 active
divisions compared with just 18 for the U.S. ...
   Writing in the current issue of Jane's Soviet Intelligence
Review, James Westwood notes that Moscow's defense budget seems
small because it includes only boots, gasoline, tires and the like
manpower costs and materials consumed in such operations as training
exercises and administration.
   Unlike the Pentagon's, the Soviet budget omits weapons
procurement, maintenance and repair, and research and development.
These military expenditures are integrated into the national ...
budget ... and made invisible. ...
   Understanding this Soviet peculiarity is important in trying to
assess Mikhail Gorbachev's new defense policy ``reasonable
sufficiency'' and his recent initiatives on troop and weapons
reduction.

students:
   A student mob barricaded in the administration building of
predominantly black Howard University has succeeded in driving
Republican National Committee chairman Lee Atwater from the school's
board of trustees.
   Specifically, the student protesters charged that President
Bush's Willie Horton campaign commercials on television were
intended to appeal to the racist fears of white voters.
   The racism allegation, which was first injected into the
presidential campaign by Gov. Michael Dukakis, Bush's Democratic
opponent, ignores the fact that Horton was never identified as black
in the GOP television commercials.
   People quick to accuse others of ``racism'' have another favorite
word for describing this affliction: ``Bigot.'' ...
   It's a term which aptly describes the view of the protesters who
hounded Atwater from the Howard University board because he is a
white Republican appointed to serve a black university.

   The Reporter, Fond du Lac, Wis., on inmate release programs:
   The folly of letting loose on society known dangerous criminals
was proven again the other day _ and it was too close to home.
   Officials at Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison (Wis.)
granted release time to a man who, police say, bought a shotgun,
stole a taxicab, slashed the driver with a knife and led officers on
a downtown chase.
   What's worse, this was the second time he had run amok.
   Paul J. Rasmussen was convicted of slaying a ... car salesman in
1974, while ... on conditional release from the old Central State
Hospital in Waupun. He was found innocent by reason of mental
disease or defect in the trial's second phase.
   Rasmussen was allowed to leave Mendota (March 7) to exercise at a
local health club and perform volunteer work at a church, where he
had worked for 2{ years. Police say he instead went on the rampage.
...
   President Bush made much of the Massachusetts early release
program in his campaign against Gov. Michael Dukakis and, we think,
quite ably showed then the folly of such tactics. It's too bad
Mendota officials did not heed his words.

<HEAD>Former Indiana Governor in Line for Ambassadorial Post, Source Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush will nominate former Indiana
Gov. Robert D. Orr to be the next U.S. ambassador to Singapore, an
administration official said today.
   The official, declining to be named publicly, said the
annoncement would come later this month.
   Orr's likely appointment was first reported by The Indianpolis
Star in a report filed from Washington. It cited an unidentified
State Department official as confirming Orr's nomination.
   The official announcement likely will come after the government
of Singapore formally responds to the Bush administration's request
to post Orr as the U.S. ambassador to the Southeast Asian island,
the official told the Star.
   The Senate would then have to confirm Orr's appointment.
   The former two-term governor, an early supporter of Bush's
presidential bid, said Tuesday he knew he had been the source of
speculation and rumor but declined to confirm the appointment.
   ``The person on the receiving end really doesn't have much to say
about it until the person on the appointing end decides what he is
going to do and makes the announcement,'' Orr said.
   ``I have said all along, two days after the election, that, yes,
I have been interested in an appointment to a nation, preferably the
Far East,'' he added.
   During his eight-year administration, Orr, 71, made four trips to
the Far East, though never to Singapore.

<HEAD>Watkins Doubts Nuclear Cleanup Will Cost $65 Billion-$100 Billion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins told Congress
today he doubted it would cost as much to clean up pollution at the
nation's nuclear weapons plants as the official estimates of between
$65 billion and $100 billion.
   ``I believe we can do this for a lot less,'' Watkins told a
Senate budget subcommittee that is examining the Energy Department's
plans for modernizing and correcting environmental problems at 16
major weapons plants in 12 states.
   Watkins, in his first congressional testimony since being sworn
in last week, said projections on the cleanup costs included ``a lot
of gold watches'' or frills that the government could not afford at
a time of tight budget limits.
   ``I don't believe we need to buy all those gold watches,''
Watkins said in reference to his efforts to develop a comprehensive
plan that would accomplish the cleanup at the least possible cost,
in part by letting some less harmful contaminants remain at the
sites until sometime in the next century.
   Shortly before Watkins took over, the department had officially
estimated it would cost $81 billion to clean up and modernize the
weapons complex over the next 21 years, and some department
officials said recently that this figure may be too low. The General
Accounting Office, the auditing agency of the Congress, has put the
price tag at over $100 billion.
   Watkins said one of his immediate priorities was to re-establish
the credibility of the Energy Department, which has been strongly
criticized by members of Congress and government auditors for poor
management of the weapons complex and lax oversight of safety
procedures.
   ``I'll guarantee we'll get our act together,'' Watkins said. He
promised to present a more detailed plan for cleanup and
modernization of the plants by summer.
   Because of the management and safety problems, the country's only
nuclear reactors that produce tritium, which is needed in the
manufacture of nuclear warheads, have been shut down for nearly a
year.
   The Energy Department has said these reactors must be restarted
by the end of the year in order to avoid a squeeze on tritium
supplies.
   Watkins said it was crucial that these reactors be restarted in
order to assure tritium supplies that are vital to national security.
   He rejected suggestions from some public interest groups that
tritium production be suspended indefinitely in order to encourage
an agreement with the Soviet Union on freezing production of nuclear
weapons materials, including plutonium.
   ``We aren't yet at a point in arms control where we can throw
away our bargaining chips,'' he said.

   The City Council wants the school board to
fire Joe Clark, the bat- and bullhorn-wielding principal portrayed
in the movie ``Lean on Me.''
   However, the board will not follow the recommendation, said board
attorney Robert G. Rosenberg.
   The council Tuesday approved by a 5-4 vote a resolution asking
the Paterson Board of Education to replace Clark, the Eastside High
School principal who gained praise from the Reagan administration
for roaming school halls with a bat and bullhorn.
   The resolution cites teacher layoffs and a school assembly last
month in which scantily clad dancers performed, said city clerk
Sylvia Ulmer.
   Rosenberg said the board at its meeting Thursday would ratify
Clark's five-day suspension, ordered by School Superintendent Frank
Napier.
   ``The Board of Education, in this instance, as well as previous
history in respect to Mr. Clark, will act only on fact and
responsible behavior, not on political influence or exterior
pressure,'' he said.
   Clark has said that during the school assembly, he was out of
town promoting ``Lean On Me,'' a movie about his tenure at Eastside,
and was not present to stop the dancing when it turned out different
than he expected.

   Superintendent Elmo J. Bush said the state board of education had
asked the district to trim about $12 million from next year's
budget. The district, whose budget this year is $70 million, has
more than $10 million in unpaid bills, he said.
   The district is two weeks behind in payments to employees, and
Bush said the delay was likely to continue for some time.
   East St. Louis, located across the Mississippi River from St.
Louis, Mo., has been plagued for years by a declining tax base and
other budget problems.

   Leftist rebels today attacked
army positions in the north and stepped up their campaign against
Sunday's elections by threatening to kill election workers.
   At least three soldiers and six guerrillas were killed, police
and army sources said.
   Guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
struck several garrisons and posts in the northernmost province of
Chalatenango, army and rebel reports said.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said 13 soldiers were
killed or wounded in the town of Tejutla, 30 miles north of San
Salvador.
   The radio said guerrillas also hit the garrison in the provincial
capital of Chalatenango, 28 miles northeast of the capital, and army
or civil defense posts in three other towns.
   The radio did not immediately provide casualty figures.
   Col. Ciro Lopez Roque, commander of the 4th infantry brigade,
said in a radio interview that the army had no precise figures but
that ``there were quite a few casualties.''
   The armed forces press committee said three soldiers died and
three were wounded in the fighting.
   A police spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, reached
by telephone in Chalatenango said the bodies of six guerrillas had
been recovered. The rebels also broadened an implicit threat made
earlier this week.
   ``The polling places will be sabotaged and those persons who lend
themselves to this electoral game will later be killed, because
participation indicates agreement with escalation of the war,'' said
a rebel statement sent to radio stations.
   The leftist Farbundo Marti National Liberation Front said earlier
this week that election officials would be considered part of the
counterinsurgency campaign. The threats were similar to those that
have been made against mayors.
   Nine mayors have been assassinated. More than half the country's
262 mayors have resigned because of the threats.
   ``The guerrillas' opposition to the elections confirms the belief
that what they want is to take power by force,'' said President Jose
Napoleon Duarte in a Tuesday television interview.
   Sunday's election presents Salvadorans with their first
opportunity to vote out an incumbent civilian administration and
polls indicate they may do just that. The rightist Republican
Nationalist Alliance, led by Alfredo Cristiani, is favored to beat
the Christian Democrats led by Fidel Chavez Mena.
   The third major contender is a leftist alliance, the Democratic
Convergence. The coalition has been strained by the guerrilla
threats, but its candidate, Guillermo Ungo, may force a runoff with
a strong third-place finish.
   Duarte, the incumbent Christian Democrat who is not running for
re-election, said he feared rebel intimidation would keep people
from the polls.
   The atmosphere in the capital was tense as Duarte spoke. Rebel
sabotage of telephone and electrical installations have
significantly reduced vital services.
   The rebel movement has been fighting the U.S.-backed government
for nine years.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court will review a
petition by a death row inmate trying to block the execution of mass
murderer R. Gene Simmons against Simmons' wishes, a spokeswoman said
today.
   The emergency appeal was filed by inmate Jonas H. Whitmore with
Justice Harry Blackmun, who referred it to the full court,
spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said.
   Simmons, scheduled to die by lethal injection at 7 a.m. Thursday
in Arkansas' first execution in 25 years, has waived an appeal,
saying he wants to die.
   Whitmore's attorney, Arthur Allen, said Tuesday that if Simmons'
sentence is carried out, it will open the way to more executions in
Arkansas.
   The state Supreme Court rejected Whitmore's petition Monday,
ruling that Whitmore lacked legal standing to address Simmons'
rights.
   State law gives Simmons the right to an automatic appeal of his
conviction and death sentence, handed down last month for the 1987
Christmastime murders of 14 family members.
   If Simmons changes his mind at any point before the execution,
the process will be stopped, said James Lee, spokesman for state
Attorney General Steve Clark.
   Simmons was arrested in 1987 in Russellville after a shooting
spree that left two people dead. When police went to his rural home
near Dover, they found the bodies of 14 of Simmons' relatives.
   Simmons was convicted separately and sentenced to death last year
for the two Russellville murders.

<HEAD>Two TV News Executives Fired Amid Computer-Tapping Allegations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A TV station has fired two news executives in
the wake of allegations that one tapped into the newsroom computers
of a competing station.
   WTSP, an ABC affiliate in St. Petersburg, announced on Tuesday
the firings of assistant news director Michael I. Shapiro, 33, and
news director Terry Cole, 32.
   Vince Barresi, WTSP vice president and general manager, told
viewers during the 11 p.m. newscast that the station acted to
``avoid any questions about the objective way we do our business in
keeping the public informed.''
   Shapiro was charged in February with 14 computer-related counts
in an alleged series of raids on the confidential news files at CBS
affiliate WTVT. Each charge carries up to 15 years in prison and a
$10,000 fine.
   Shapiro had been an assignment manager WTVT, where he helped set
up security for the computer system. He was hired by Cole in
September.
   Officials would not elaborate on Cole's part in the case.
   Law enforcement and TV industry officials have called Shapiro's
case the first of its kind involving tampering with a television
newsroom computer.
   Bob Franklin, WTVT interim news director, said, ``I said at the
outset that we regard this as a very serious matter and we'll take
whatever steps necessary to see that this never happens again.''

   Italian archaeologists will bring the latest
technology to the Soviet Union in exchange for access to remote
areas of Soviet Asia under an accord signed Wednesday in Rome, the
Italian news agency AGI reported.
   The accord was signed by Valery P. Alexeyev, director of the
Institute of Archaeology of the Soviet Acadamy of Sciences, and
Gherardo Gnoli, director of the Italian Institute for the Middle and
Extreme Orient.
   The Italians will share advanced technology such as computer
analyses of aerial photos and its application in archaeological
research.
   Soviet archaeologists will make data available and permit
Italians to accompany them on missions to places such as Siberia,
Turkmenia and Mongolia, sites where little or no work has been done,
the agency said.
   Italians will have access to a site in the Soviet steppes where
4,500 tombs have been discovered that date from the seventh century
B.C. to the third century A.D.

   President Reagan approved a secret arrangement
under which Honduras got tens of millions of dollars in military aid
in exchange for supporting the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, former
national security adviser Robert McFarlane testified today.
   Under questioning by defense lawyers at Oliver North's
Iran-Contra trial, McFarlane detailed how Reagan initialed a plan in
mid-February 1985 that resulted in Honduras getting speeded-up
deliveries of rifles, ammunition and machine guns.
   The matter was so sensitive, McFarlane acknowledged under
questioning, that the arrangement was discussed verbally with the
Honduran president and was not given to him in writing.
   North's lawyers say the Reagan administration had a policy of
hiding its quid pro quo arrangements with other countries to support
the Contras during a two-year congressional ban on U.S. military aid
to the rebels.
   Five of the 12 criminal charges against North, a former White
House aide, are that he made false statements and obstructed
Congress in 1985 and 1986 with regard to his activities on behalf of
the Contras.
   McFarlane said Reagan initialed a Feb. 18, 1985 memo approving
the secret arrangements with Honduras. The memo was signed by
McFarlane and had been prepared by North and another National
Security Council staffer. It was the culmination of discussions by
Cabinet officials in the administration.
   McFarlane agreed with defense attorney Brendan Sullivan that the
extra aid to Honduras was worth ``tens of millions of dollars.''
   Sullivan mentioned during McFarlane's testimony a Feb. 25, 1985
memo by the former national security adviser marked ``enhanced
support for Honduras.'' In it, McFarlane stated: ``We seem to be
well on our way to release of $35 million.''
   After the quid pro quo arrangement went in effect, McFarlane said
he got a memo from then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger saying
that expedited delivery of military equipment had begun.
   The additional aid also included other unspecified assistance
from an unidentified government agency.
   At the time of the quid pro quo arrangements, Honduras was
harboring many of the Contras in camps along the country's southern
border and Honduran officials feared troops of Nicaragua's leftist
government might attack them.
   In April 1985, a Honduran military official stopped a shipment of
ammunition to the Contras and McFarlane in an April 25, 1985 note
urged Reagan to telephone the Honduran president and have him let
the shipment go through, the trial was told.
   Reagan sent back comments saying he had told the Honduran
president ``to deliver the ammunition.'' Reagan and the Hondran
president also discussed the fact that Honduran officials were
coming to the United States and would discuss about $15 million in
aid for Honduras when they met with then-Secretary of State George
Shultz and Weinberger.
   McFarlane's testimony followed a temporary halt in the trial this
morning as North's lawyers tried to introduce classified material
while cross-examining the former national security official.
   The dispute erupted after Sullivan, while questioning McFarlane,
tried to introduce a Feb. 11, 1985, memo from North and another man
to McFarlane. The memo, relayed to members of the National Security
Council, concerned Honduras and a buildup of Contra forces.
   U.S. District Judge Gerhard Gesell called lawyers to the bench,
saying with resignation, ``I guess we'll have to do it this way.''
After a few minutes, he announced he would have to send the jury out
of the courtroom. The lawyers then argued over the matter behind
closed doors.
   Gesell has said he wants to avoid a ``cuckoo-clock trial'' in
which national security concerns trigger repeated delays in the
proceedings.
   The dispute came after Gesell said he would decline to rule now
on the question of whether classified material that North's lawyers
want to introduce should be allowed into the case.
   Gesell said he will rule on a piecemeal basis in connection with
the information North's attorneys want to present in cross-examining
McFarlane.
   Prosecutor John Keker said Sullivan has three books of material
he wants to use in cross-examining McFarlane which contain
classified material. Keker said he wanted the judge to rule now on
whether classifed material from those books should be presented in
censored form or be allowed in an uncensored format.
   Gesell refused, saying that would involve two or three days of
hearings on secrecy questions and that ``I have told you scores of
times'' that he was going to give the defense wide latitude in
cross-examining prosecution witnesses.
   The judge said he will make individual rulings from the bench as
the classified material comes up.
   Keker said he was seeking an orderly procedure in which these
questions would be raised ahead of time and that a review of the
three books wouldn't take two or three days, but rather a matter of
hours.
   In connection with one matter, Gesell said North's lawyers will
be permitted to introduce the names of Central American countries
and Central American officials from a document spelling out the
Reagan administration's quid pro quo arrangements with third
countries. Those arrangements involved offering inducements to the
countries in exchange for their support of the Contras.

<HEAD>Survey Says Parents Want Federal Subsidies for Child Care</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most parents favor federal subsidies and tax
breaks for child care but say states should continue regulating the
service, according to a survey released Wednesday by Kinder-Care,
the nation's largest chain of day care centers.
   The national telephone survey, of 502 parents with children under
10, also indicated a trend toward wider acceptance of center-based
care. Fifty-five percent of the parents said they personally would
find it acceptable to place children under 3 in a child care center,
including 19 percent who said center care would be OK for infants
under 12 months.
   Asked how they felt about federal regulation, 56 percent
responded very or somewhat positive.
   But when asked whether states or the federal government should
should regulate class size, cost, professional training, class
activities and number of children per person providing the care,
more parents favored the state. They were evenly split on who should
set health and safety standards. More than half said federal
regulation would drive up the cost of child care.
   A full 88 percent of the parents said the federal government
should give tax credits or deductions for child care and 49 percent
said the current maximum tax credit of $4,800 per household should
be increased. Forty-one percent favored subsidies for low-income
families and 28 percent said they supported subsidies to all income
groups.
   The survey conducted by the New York firm of Research &amp; Forecasts
Inc. has a margin of error of 5 percentage points.
   Kinder-Care, based in Montgomery, Ala., runs more than 1,200
centers serving 130,000 children in 40 states and two Canadian
provinces. The company, which favors the current system of state
regulation, grossed $300 million last year.

   The Vatican on Wednesday carved up the
archdiocese of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the world's largest, into five
separate church districts.
   The move drastically reduces the domain of Cardinal Paulo
Evaristo Arns, considered a leader of the Brazilian church's
progressive wing.
   It shrinks Sao Paulo, Brazil's commercial center, from an
archdiocese of 14.5 million people to 7.1 million people, according
to Vatican figures.
   The other 7.4 million people are now divided up into the newly
created dioceses of Campo Limpo, Osasco, Santo Amaro and Sao Miguel
Paulista.
   Some Brazilians believe the action is part of a campaign by Pope
John Paul II to weaken the dominant progressive wing of the church
in Brazil and the powerful Brazilian Bishops Conference.
   The four new dioceses contain most of the church-run community
centers that often work with leftist political parties. Each will
get its own bishop, appointed by John Paul.

   Mushers in the 1,168-mile Iditarod Trail Sled
Dog Race charged along Alaska's frozen west coast today in a tight
race to the finish line in this historic Gold Rush town.
   Joe Runyan, 40, of Nenana, led a pack of five front-runners in
the Anchorage-to-Nome trek today when he left White Mountain, 77
miles from the finish, with a five-minute lead over defending
champion Susan Butcher, 33, of Manley.
   Butcher, who has won the last three races, was down to 11 dogs _
several with diarrhea _ while Runyan was running 14.
   Race officials expected the winner to claim the $50,000
first-prize sometime around noon AST (4 p.m. EST).
   Rick Swenson, the only musher ever to win the race four times,
arrived in White Mountain an hour before Runyan left and said he had
given up hope of catching him. ``My goal now is to get it over
with,'' Swenson said.
   Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Lavon Barve of Wasilla were fourth
and fifth respectively.
   Forty-one of the 49 mushers who left Anchorage on March 4
remained in the race Tuesday. They use up to 18 dogs.
   The annual race began 17 years ago and was inspired by a sled-dog
relay of serum to Nome during a 1925 diphtheria outbreak. Butcher
finished the 1988 race in just under 11 days and 12 hours to set a
record.
   As they awaited the finishers, workers in Nome moved snow onto
historic Front Street, normally swept clean for traffic. The first
musher to cross the finish line wins $50,000 and $200,000 is divided
among the next 19 finishers.
   The race, whose trail is named for the gold mining ghost town of
Iditarod at the halfway point, attracts dozens of volunteers from
around the world.
   ``I think (author) Jack London put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild,''' Iditarod volunteer Peter Elstub said. ``It's a true
sporting event.''
   Elstub, a British Army soldier, has used his annual leave for
eight years to work for the Iditarod, performing tasks ranging from
telephone duty to dropping dog food along the trail. When military
duty kept him away in 1987, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for
race updates.
   ``It don't matter where I am in the world,'' he said. ``I still
want me dog information.''
   Unlike some years in which weather was a major factor in the
outcome, this year's Iditarod has been blessed with almost ideal
conditions.
   Racers stop at 25 checkpoints along the route and are required to
make two extended rest stops, one for 24 hours, the other for six
hours.
   Commercial jets flying into Nome operated near capacity Tuesday
as mushers' families and other race watchers headed toward this town
of 4,300 people on Alaska's west coast. Pilots pointed out stretches
of the trail and encouraged passengers to keep their eyes open for
sled teams.
   Nome, which looks onto the frozen Norton Sound, took on a party
atmosphere helped by sunny skies and temperatures in the 20s. Singer
Hobo Jim, known for a song with the refrain ``I did, I did, I did
the Iditarod Trail,'' entertained customers at a Front Street saloon.
   For the locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said Mary Knodel, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   Knodel said she doesn't root for individual mushers.
   ``After watching the race for all these years, you get to know
most of them,'' she said. ``It's like family. You don't like picking
one over another.''
   But Marylou Haggren, of Kodiak, was rooting for Butcher.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' she said. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   Seventeen mortar rounds believed to
contain poisonous gases were unearthed at a World War II disposal
site by space agency workers digging a pipeline on Redstone Arsenal.
   Ed Peters, a spokesman for the Army Missile Command at the
arsenal, said the pipeline work remained shut down Wednesday as Army
specialists decide whether digging can safely continue.
   Peters said the 17 rusty, 4.2-inch shells were found Saturday in
the ``Boneyard,'' a field where stockpiles of chemical warfare
weaponry once were burned and buried. He said the field was a
post-World War II disposal site for arsenal-produced mustard gases,
choking gases and blistering agents as well as poison gases captured
from Nazi Germany.
   The shells were found by construction workers digging a new
helium pipeline for the Marshall Space Flight Center. Peters said a
bomb disa defense budget that would be approved for a
two-year period instead of one year at a time as is customary, an
argument Pentagon officials say will build stability into the
weapons-buying process.
   In introducing Cheney, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of
the Armed Services panel, said Cheney's ``sense of humility and a
sense of presence served him well and will serve America well.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he recommended the
nomination with a ``combination of pride and regret'' because he was
losing the No. 2 GOP leader in the House.
   Cheney conceded that the decision to leave the House had been
``wrenching.''
   ``I'm here not because I sought the job but because the president
asked me to take on a difficult assignment,'' he said.

   The exchange of messages between Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev paved
the way for expanding of Iran's relations with the East bloc, the
speaker of the Iranian parliament said Wednesday.
   Hashemi Rafsanjani made the remark during a meeting in Tehran
with Milko Balev, chairman of Bulgarian National Assembly's foreign
committee, according to Iran's official news agency.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze was granted a rare
audience with Khomeini, Iran's spiritual leader, on Feb. 26.
Shevardnadze's message from Gorbachev was in reply to an earlier
letter from Khomeini.
   During the audience, Khomeini called for the expansion of ties
between Tehran and Moscow, according to the agency, monitored in
Nicosia.
   Balev, who arrived Saturday, told Rafsanjani that Bulgaria is
ready to set up a friendship association between Bulgarian and
Iranian lawmakers.
   Balev also repeated an invitation from President Tudor Zhivkov to
Rafsanjani to visit Sofia.

<HEAD>Chief Justice Urges 30 Percent Boost in Pay for Federal Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, warning of
a ``serious threat to the future of the judiciary,'' made a highly
unusual personal appeal Wednesday for a 30 percent increase in
federal judges' pay.
   He urged Congress _ which has rejected a 51 percent pay hike
proposed for itself, federal judges and high-ranking government
officials _ to give special consideration to the judiciary.
   Rehnquist told a rare news conference: ``Judges ought not to be
in it for the money. They'd have to be out of their minds.''
   But, he continued, ``unlike many other positions, judging
requires that you be a lawyer. Many people feel lawyers make too
much money. But that's a fact of life so far as recruiting federal
judges is concerned.''
   ``We're not saying offer them the same they would make in private
practice. We're saying offer them enough so they'll be able to
educate their kids.''
   Rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trial
judges from $89,500 now to $116,350, and from $95,000 to $123,000
for appeals court judges. The plan would hike the chief justice's
yearly pay from $115,000 to $149,500 and raise the salary of other
high court justices from $110,000 to $143,000.
   The pay raise proposal was adopted Tuesday by the U.S. Judicial
Conference, the policy-making arm of the federal judiciary presided
over by Rehnquist.
   Congress was responding to a public outcry last month when it
rejected the proposed 51 percent pay raise recommended by a
presidential commission. Supporters of higher pay for judges hope
singling out the judiciary for bigger salaries will ease
congressional fears of retaliation by the voters.
   ``Failure to adequately address this issue poses the most serious
threat to the future of the judiciary and its continued operations
that I have observed,'' Rehnquist said.
   He said many federal judges may leave the bench for more
lucrative private practice if no relief is provided, noting that
some young judicial law clerks make more money than judges as soon
as the clerks begin private practice.
   The problem is particularly acute in big cities where recruiting
qualified judges is becoming more difficult, Rehnquist said.
   ``Without redress, the federal judiciary as we know it cannot
continue to meet the high standards the public has come to expect
from it,'' he said.
   Rehnquist noted that appointment to the federal bench is intended
to be for a lifetime to insulate judges from political pressures.
   By contrast, he said that state judges in his home state of
Arizona frequently used a judicial appointment as a steppingstone to
career advancement.
   A lifetime appointment ``gives you a different kind of judge,
someone simply devoted to judging rather than looking out of the
corner of your eye for the next political opportunity that comes
along,'' Rehnquist said.
   The U.S. Judicial Conference said the number of judges resigning
to return to private practice is increasing. It said 57 federal
judges have resigned since 1974, compared with six in the 16
preceding years.
   There are some 540 federal trial judges and 150 appeals court
judges.

   A blustery late-winter snowstorm dumped up to 18 inches in the
upper Great Lakes region as a cold front to the south unleashed
fierce thunderstorms and dust storms turned skies a butterscotch
color in the Central Plains.
   The weather was blamed for six traffic deaths _ three in
Minnesota, two in Kansas and one in Indiana.
   The snowstorm came from a deep low pressure system that developed
east of the Rocky Mountains and intensified as it reached the Great
Lakes, said Don Baker, meteorologist with the National Weather
Service in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The heaviest snowfalls in Michigan's Upper Peninsula were 18
inches in Wakefield, 14 inches in Marquette and 12 inches in L'Anse,
Baker said today.
   More snow was expected in Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, with
snowfall totals in western Upper Michigan possibly approaching 2
feet.
   ``We did get dumped on quite a bit,'' said Deputy Bruce Davey of
the Gogebic County Sheriff's Department in the Upper Peninsula.
``People around here are pretty resolved we have to deal with this
kind of snowfall in the winter.''
   In Minneapolis-St. Paul, a snowfall of 7 inches Tuesday forced
the airport to close for three hours, the first closing this season.
   ``We had 2 to 3 to 4 inches coming down an hour, which is about
as bad as it gets here,'' said George Condon of the Metropolitan
Airports Commission.
   Even snow removal crews were taken off the runways. ``We pulled
everybody off the field because the visibility was so bad,'' Condon
said.
   Thunderstorms ahead of a cold front produced large hail and
damaging winds in Illinois, Indiana and Michigan. At Detroit
Metropolitan Airport, gusts up to 58 mph were reported Tuesday night.
   Earlier Tuesday, strong winds circulating around the powerful low
pressure system swirled dust and snow in the Central Plains.
   High winds hammered eastern Colorado. Gusts of up to 120 mph
northwest of Loveland knocked down trees and utility poles. A dozen
ski lifts in Colorado's Summit County west of Denver were
temporarily shut down by the wind.
   The storm crossed into Oklahoma from Kansas and hit Tulsa during
the afternoon rush hour, turning the sky a butterscotch color. Larry
Ruthi a National Weather Service forecaster, said it was Oklahoma's
worst dust storm in five years.
   ``This is almost entirely Kansas dirt _ it's brown, not red,'' he
said.
   In Kansas, wind-blown dust piled up against fences like snow
drifts, said Sheriff Ron Achilles of Gove County.
   Officials reported scores of traffic accidents statewide,
including two fatal ones as the dust storm made the noon sky look
like twilight. Firefighters battled scattered grass fires and many
highways closed because of poor visibility.
   Interstate 70 was closed from Hays to the Colorado border, a
distance of 160 miles, from late morning through most of the
afternoon because of poor visibility and the need to clear traffic
accidents from the road, said Lt. Jerry Dietz of the Kansas Highway
Patrol.
   Hill City, Kan., had a gust at 72 mph around noon.
   The high winds and blowing dust combined to shut down Kansas City
International Airport for about 90 minutes at the height of the
storm.
   ``If you can imagine a handful of dirt in your eyes, that was
it,'' said Kansas Highway Patrol Trooper Douglas Griffiths in
Norton. ``That's not an exaggeration.''

<TEXT>
   A civilian judge today indicted
and jailed two army officers, accusing them of a role in the
massacre of 10 peasant farmers.
   It was the first time that armed forces officers had been
indicted for killing civilians in nine years of civil war during
which the armed forces have been accused of thousands of slaying.
   Judge Alcides Guandique also indicted seven soldiers for their
alleged role in the killings. Guandique, 33, handed down the
indictments in his office in San Sebastian, 30 miles east of San
Salvador.
   The United States, which provides most of the Salvadoran
government's funds, has lobbied for a credible investigation into
the slayings and punishment for those responsible.
   Maj. Mauricio Beltran Granados and 2nd Lt. Arnaldo Vasquez
Alvarenga were jailed pending their trials, which were likely to
begin in several weeks, Guandique said.
   The indictments came only four days before the March 19
presidential election in which Salvadorans, for the first time, will
have the chance to eject an incumbent civilian government in favor
of another party.
   The slayings occurred last Sept. 21, when troops used explosives
and rifle fire to kill 10 people in the hamlet of San Francisco,
four miles north of San Salvador, according to the indictments.
   Other villagers said the 10 were accused by the soldiers of
collaborating with leftist guerrillas waging a 9-year-old war
against the U.S.-backed government.
   The armed forces on Sunday, in an unprecedented step, admitted
responsibility for the massacre and submitted those implicated to
civilian jurisdiction.
   With Guandique's indictment and decree of provisional detention,
the officers became the first in Salvadoran history to be jailed on
the order of a civilian judge.
   The army originally said the ten peasants had died in ``fierce
combat,'' then said they had been killed in a guerrilla ambush that
injured nobody else.
   Guandique has won praise from human rights advocates for his
persistent investigation of the case.
   About 70,000 people have died during the civil war between the
leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, most of them
civilians.

   The Bush administration today unveiled
long-promised legislation setting up a system of tax credits to help
low-income parents make child-care arrangements.
   President Bush's proposal, outlined by Press Secretary Marlin
Fitzwater after Bush briefed several members of Congress in the
Cabinet Room, would provide a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each
child under age 4 in low-income working families. He said 2.5
million American families would initially benefit from the
legislation.
   ``Families would be free to choose the kind of child care that
best suits their needs,'' Fitzwater told reporters during the daily
news briefing.
   Bush pledged during his presidential campaign that he would seek
to assist low-income families, in which at least one parent works,
by using the tax code to help defray the cost of child-care.
   The legislation was being introduced on Capitol Hill by Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   ``The important aspect of this program is that it encourages
child care development,'' Fitzwater said. ``It offers parents a
choice that don't now have a choice _ members of the poor ... who
cannot afford whatever programs are in their area.''
   ``This offers federal assistance for parents that might want to
use relatives for child care,'' he added, saying that ``it gets at
the problem from the standpoint of providing child care for those
who do not currently have it available.''
   Under the bill Bush seeks, which will have to compete with
Democratic-sponsored legislation, the tax credit would be provided
to families with incomes ranging from $8,000 to $13,000 a year in
the 1990 tax year.
   For each child under the age of 4, families would receive a
credit equal to 14 percent of wages, with a maximum credit equal to
$1,000 per child.
   The major Democratic bill is the $2.5 billion Act for Better
Child Care Services. Most of the money would be for direct
assistance to low-income families. The rest would go to improve
quality, expand supply and set up an insurance risk pool. States
would have to comply with minimum health and safety standards about
five years after enactment.
   Fitzwater noted that the child-care tax credit proposal was one
of Bush's campaign pledges and said that it was ``the substance or
the basis of his meeting this morning with members of Congress who
are interested in this proposal.''
   ``Our purpose here is to provide ... care where none exists,''
the spokesman said, ``to provide maximum choice to families. Our
belief is that parents can decide best how to take care of their
children. So this maximizes options and it does not eliminate the
more formal day-care centers and child-care centers.''
   Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., talking to reporters in the White
House driveway following the meeting with Bush, said he thought the
president was moving ``in the right direction.''
   ``The president is not using this program to set up a huge
bureaucracy,'' Boschwitz said. ``He's allowing the working poor with
children to go back to work.''
   Under existing law, parents are allowed a $720 credit for child
care costs incurred in order to accept or keep employment, but it
applies only to families with sufficient income to pay federal
income taxes.

   Former Monty Python troupe member John Cleese
called it weird when he was honored with the 12th Annual Jack Benny
Award for his comedy career.
   ``It just feels very strange for a guy ... who used to sit there
in front of the television set watching George Burns and Jack Benny
to be sitting here in Los Angeles 3,000 years later being given this
award,'' Cleese said at the ceremony Tuesday. ``It's very weird.''
   Cleese plans to attend the Academy Awards ceremony March 29. His
film ``A Fish Called Wanda'' is up for three Oscars.
   Cleese is nominated for the screenplay. Director Charles Crichton
is nominated for best director and actor Kevin Kline for best

   Long before opera singer Roberta Peters broke
into a chorus of ``Climb Every Mountain,'' it was clear this wasn't
a typical state legislative hearing.
   Actor Tony Randall wagged a finger at lawmakers in classic Felix
Unger style from his long-running TV series ``The Odd Couple.''
Legislators carried cameras for candid celebrity shots. Two actors
walked in on stilts.
   The performers came to complain that arts groups were being
shortchanged in the proposed New York budget.
   ``The arts are not basic for physical survival, we know that,''
said Peters. ``But they're a necessity for civilized living. We have
to provide for our children an environment and availability of the
arts to teach them an appreciation of what is so aptly called the
finer things in life.''
   Other speakers included actress Kitty Carlisle Hart, chairperson
of the state Council on the Arts, actress Celeste Holm, dancer Clyde
Morgan and ballerina Suzanne Farrell.
   Gov. Mario Cuomo has called for an $8 million cut in the
Council's $60 million operating budget as the state gears for a
battle over a proposed $46.6 billion budget for the fiscal year
beginning April 1.
   Randall said such states as Alabama and Alaska are spending more
money per resident on the arts than New York.
   ``Don't let Alabama get ahead of New York,'' he scolded the
lawmakers.

   Boxer Hector ``Macho'' Camacho got some
cuts on his head when he ran his 1987 Lotus off a fog-bound Central
Florida road and slammed into a palm tree.
   The former World Boxing Council lightweight champion was slightly
injured and was charged with careless driving, said Daphalene
Weaver, a state trooper in Fort Myers.
   A woman who identified herself as the boxer's girlfriend answered
the phone Tuesday night at Camacho's Clewiston home. She said the
fighter was OK and had gone to San Juan, Puerto Rico, for television
interviews.
   ``He's fine,'' Kisha Colon said.
   Camacho, 26, bested Ray ``Boom Boom'' Mancini March 6 in a
non-title fight in Las Vegas.
   In October, Camacho pleaded no contest to a possession of cocaine
charge in Hendry County. The boxer was placed on three years'
probation, paid a $1,500 fine and ordered to take random drug
screenings.

   Tiny Tim, the warbly voiced singer best known
for his 1960s hit ``Tiptoe Through The Tulips,'' is trying to make a
comeback with a song and video about domestic violence.
   Tiny Tim, who was born as Herbert Khaury, was in Baltimore on
Tuesday and Wednesday to make the video for his song ``Won't You
Dance With Me.''
   ``It's really a thrill,'' the 57-year-old performer said. ``This
is the first song I'll record with a modern-day sound.''
   Tiny Tim hasn't had a hit in 20 years and admits it. The video
also features Judy Carne, the sock-it-to-me girl from the late-'60s
television show ``Laugh In.''
   Half of the proceeds from the video and the song, which was
recorded locally in January, will go to the National Coalition
Against Violence, the performer said.
   The song hasn't been sold to a record label yet and Tiny Tim is
being realistic about his comeback attempt.
   ``This is all great, but what major label has it?'' he said. ``A
record company only wants to know who sells records. They are going
to say, `What is Tiny Tim's track record?' And right now, at least,
I'm not a record seller.''

   Members of the Senate Armed Services Committee
said today they were wrapping up ``loose ends'' on the nomination of
Rep. Dick Cheney as defense secretary and hinted that a vote on the
selection could come soon.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said the committee did not want to act
``with unseemly haste,'' but indicated that a decision on the
Wyoming Republican could come as early as today.
   However, Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said he did not expect a
committee vote until Thursday.
   The committee met in closed session with Cheney this morning to
discuss his financial records and other background questions,
congressional aides said.
   McCain said the panel also was taking care of ``loose ends,''
reviewing reports on the nominee from the White House. He did not
specify whether the information included the FBI background check of
Cheney, chosen by Prewsident Bush for the Pentagon post after the
Senate rejected his first nominee, John Tower.
   On the opening day of hearings Tuesday, Cheney submitted a letter
from his cardiologist, Dr. Allan M. Ross of The George Washington
University Medical Center, stating that the nominee is ``fit to
accept any position requiring the highest intellectual behavior and
physical performance.''
   Cheney has suffered three heart attacks and underwent coronary
bypass surgery last year.
   Senators saw no roadblocks to confirmation of Cheney as they
tried to put ill feelings from the rancorous, partisan debate over
the Tower nomination behind them. Bush announced the selection of
Cheney on Friday, one day after the Senate defeated the nomination
of Tower, a former Texas senator, 53-47.
   Members of the Armed Services panel suggested Tuesday that the
confirmation process could be wrapped up by week's end, when the
Senate breaks for a two-week recess.
   ``I'm delighted with this nomination,'' said Sen. James Exon of
Nebraska, second-ranking Democrat on the panel. ``I hope this
confirmation goes quickly and I believe it will.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said the panel
would ``not be taking any shortcuts'' on the nomination, saying it
was still awaiting letters from White House and Pentagon counsels on
Cheney's financial record and the FBI background check.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked when the FBI
checks on Cheney would be finished, said, ``They're trying to move
those as rapidly as possible. ... I don't have a specific date.''
   Cheney spent the opening day of hearings expounding on his views
of defense policy as committee members praised the nominee, gave him
high marks for his answers and left little doubt about the final
outcome on the nomination.
   ``I thank the president for sending your nomination to us,'' said
Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill.
   On a series of defense and foreign policy issues, Cheney
cautioned against any U.S. reductions in military strength in
response to changes in the Soviet Union.
   ``It would be a great mistake to reduce our own military
capabilities and lessen our defense posture,'' Cheney said.
   Questioned by Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on
the committee, Cheney said he was once skeptical of the changes in
the Soviet Union by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, but that he now
believes the Soviets are sincere in seeking arms controls.
   On other issues, Cheney said:
   _He has been a strong supporter of the Strategic Defense
Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars. The Pentagon is conducting
a strategic and budget review that will have a major impact on Star
Wars funding. Asked about the level of funding, Cheney said,
``That's an open question.''
   _The United States should encourage Japan and Western Europe to
spend more money on defense, but the U.S. argument should be that
the additional funding ``is required for our common defense.''
   _Donald Atwood has agreed to accept his nomination as deputy
secretary of defense. Atwood had been chosen by Bush when Tower was
nominated.
   _He supports a defense budget that would be approved for a
two-year period instead of one year at a time as is customary, an
argument Pentagon officials say will build stability into the
weapons-buying process.
   In introducing Cheney, Sen. Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo., a member of
the Armed Services panel, said Cheney's ``sense of humility and a
sense of presence served him well and will serve America well.''
   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he recommended the
nomination with a ``combination of pride and regret'' because he was
losing the No. 2 GOP leader in the House.
   Cheney conceded that the decision to leave the House had been
``wrenching.''
   ``I'm here not because I sought the job but because the president
asked me to take on a difficult assignment,'' he said.

   Central American diplomats today reached an
agreement in principle for U.N. peacekeepers to patrol Central
America to make sure guerrillas do not launch cross-border raids.
   The U.N.'s working document for the force called for up to 100
military observers to monitor Central American border areas in
speedboats, helicopters and all-terrain vehicles.
   Military officers and foreign ministry officials from Nicaragua,
El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica and Guatemala reached agreement in
principle to recommend the plan today, hours before their two days
of talks were scheduled to end.
   ``We approved the document in the sense that we discussed the
document, and there are no disagreements,'' said Nicaragua's deputy
foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, as he left U.N. Headquarters.
   The foreign ministers of five nations will now ask the United
Nations to begin setting up the peacekeeping force, a step that
Tinoco called ``a formality.''
   The head of the Honduran delegation, Ambassador Roberto Flores
Bermudez, confirmed that agreement in principle had been achieved.
   Up to 11,000 Nicaraguan rebels have bases in Honduras from which
they launch raids into Nicaragua. They are the prime focus of the
U.N. peacekeeping plan.

   Animals weary of wading through deep,
crusty snow have taken to highways and railroad tracks, and more

officials said.
   The animals have been killed by trains or motor vehicles in

   ``There's a tendency for them to walk on the trails and the
biggest trails available to them are the tracks and the roads,''
said Carl Grauvogel, a state wildlife biologist in Palmer.
   Salting could be a big factor.
   ``I've seen moose kneeling right in the highways,'' said Mike

that's all that would be there.''

   A cop-killer whose 1985 grant of clemency
from Gov. Mario Cuomo was denounced by then-Vice President George
Bush was granted parole today.
   Gary McGivern, who was convicted of murder in the 1968 shooting
of a deputy sheriff, could be free by the end of the week, once the
paperwork is done, officials said.
   The decision followed an appearance by McGivern before a
three-member Board of Parole panel at the medium-security prison
where he is serving a life sentence.
   It was McGivern's third such appearance since Cuomo's New Year's
Eve 1985 clemency that was attacked by Bush and many New York law
enforcement officials. Twice McGivern was turned down because of the
nature of the crime.
   Edward Elwin, executive director of the Board of Parole, said the
penal cited McGivern's ``outstanding record'' in prison in voting
3-0 to release him under ``intense supervision.''
   Cuomo, as lieutenant governor, recommended clemency in 1979 after
McGivern passed two lie detector tests, but then-Gov. Hugh Carey
said no. Six years later, Cuomo granted clemency, making McGivern
eligible for an immediate parole hearing.
   ``It was a very difficult call,'' said Cuomo. ``This man is not a
cop killer.''
   For a time, McGivern was on death row, but an appeals court kept
him from going to the chair.
   Corrections Department spokesman James Flateau said McGivern was
refusing to grant interviews.
   In the past, the very idea that McGivern was even getting a
parole hearing brought out placard-carrying prison guards and law
enforcement officials. That was true again this week as members of
the state Sheriffs' Association protested outside parole board
offices in Albany on Tuesday.
   ``McGivern hasn't learned anything except how to work the system.
The people who will learn something from McGivern's early release
are the potential cop killers,'' Peter Kehoe, executive director of
the sheriffs' group, said in a statement.
   ``They'll learn that it's okay to kill a cop today _ society
won't care about the dead cop in a few years.''
   On Wednesday, there were no demonstrators at the parole board's
Albany office or outside the Otisville prison.
   Kavanagh has said McGivern's parole may boost efforts to override
a Cuomo veto of legislation restoring the death penalty. The state's
electric chair hasn't been used since 1963 and Cuomo has vetoed
death penalty legislation for the past six years.
   ``A reasonable, rule-abiding inmate,'' said state Corrections
Commissioner Thomas Coughlin last week when asked about McGivern.
``I think if Gary McGivern was paroled tomorrow, he would probably
never get in trouble again.''
   After three trials, McGivern and fellow inmate Charles Culhane
received life sentences for the shooting death of William
Fitzgerald, a Westchester County deputy, during an attempt to escape
while being transported to court.
   McGivern and Culhane have blamed a third inmate, Robert Bowerman,
for the slaying. Bowerman died of gunshot wounds in the escape
attempt.
   Culhane said today's decision should help his own bid for early
release. Cuomo has refused to grant Culhane clemency, and he's not
eligible for a parole hearing until 1991.
   McGivern and Culhane's first trial ended in a hung jury. Their
conviction in a second trial was overturned on appeal. A third trial
ended in conviction in 1975.

<HEAD>Anderson Begins 5th Year of Captivity in Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American journalist Terry A. Anderson,
longest-held of the 15 Western hostages in Lebanon, begins his fifth
year of captivity Thursday with no sign that he will be freed soon.
   In the last message his captors allowed him to send _ a brief
videotape Oct. 31 four days after his 41st birthday _ Anderson said:
``I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was returing home from a tennis game March 16, 1985, when
gunmen seized him in Moslem west Beirut.
   His captors belong to Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem
group whose name means Islamic Holy War. It is believed to be part
of the fundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God.
   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American born
in Scotland who was acting dean of agriculture at the American
University of Beirut when he was abducted June 9, 1985.
   Shiites also hold most of the other Western hostages: seven
Americans, three Britons, an Italian, a Belgian and an Irishman.
   Among them is Church of England envoy Terry Waite, 48. He dropped
from sight Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut hotel to
negotiate with Islamic Jihad on behalf of Anderson and Sutherland
released.
   Six organizations of Western journalists observed Anderson's
anniversary by asking the world's media to disseminate a
``solidarity with Anderson'' statement they issued.
   It urges President Bush and his administration ``to use every
possible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and other
hostages home.''
   The International Press Institute said: ``We appeal to
governments throughout the free world to continue with their efforts
to obtain Mr. Anderson's release.''
   Some hope had arisen that so-called pragmatists in Iran would
help free the captives. It was crushed by the new revolutionary
radicalism accompanying Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that his
followers kill Salman Rushdie as a blasphemer of Islam for writing
``The Satanic Verses.''
   ``The doors have been slammed shut again,'' said the Rev.
Lawrence Jenco, an American Roman Catholic priest kidnapped by
Islamic Jihad on Jan. 8, 1985.
   He shared a cell with Anderson for several months and was freed
July 26, 1986, one of three American hostages released in President
Ronald Reagan's arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.
   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who leads the campaign for his
release, said ``the situation has fallen apart again'' because of
the furor over Rushdie.
   Islamic Jihad has demanded that Kuwait free pro-Iranian
extremists convicted for the December 1983 bombings of the U.S. and
French embassies in the Persian Gulf emirate.
   Kuwait refused. Two of the 17 bombers were released earlier this
year after serving their five-year sentences, but they were not
considered key figures.
   One of the men Islamic Jihad wants most is believed to be
Mustapha Youssef Badreddin, a cousin and brother-in-law of Imad
Mugniyeh. Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies say Mugniyeh is
Islamic Jihad's leader and a senior figure in Hezbollah.
   Badreddin and two other bombers were sentenced to death but have
not been executed.
   Among those serving life sentences is Hassan Youssed Musawi, a
cousin of Hussein Musawi, who leads another pro-Iranian Shiite
faction in Lebanon.
   Most of the Western hostages are believed held in underground
cells in Beirut's teeming southern slums, a Shiite stronghold.
   The last communication from Anderson's captors was a blurred
instant photograph of him with a cake, released Nov. 4, eight days
after his 41st birthday.
   An accompanying statement accused the Reagan administration of
avoiding steps that would free the hostages and said the
journalist's release could be achieved only by ``the implementation
of our just demands.''
   Anderson has never seen his 3-year-old daughter Sulome, born
three months after his abduction. Her mother, Madeleine, who is
Lebanese and lives in Cyprus, sent a letter to Beirut newspapers in
the hope his captors would let him read it.
   ``I would like to wake up and find you by my side ready for
another day together, but I know this is not going to happen at this
moment and today is four years since we last saw each other,'' she
wrote.
   ``I should be heartbroken, sad and depressed today. ... I am not
that at all because ... what's gone is only days of the many years
that await us, and our daughter is a constant reminder of that.
   ``She is everything I know you want her to be. She needs you, we
both need you very much, our need is becoming the source of our
strength and patience.'' Tragedy has struck Anderson's family since
he was kidnapped, but fellow hostages who have been freed say he
does not know it.
   His father, Glenn R. Anderson, died of cancer on Feb. 15, 1986,
at age 69. His elder brother Glenn Richard Jr. died of cancer on
June 7 of that year, aged 46, four days after making a videotape on
which he pleaded with Islamic Jihad from his sickbed to free Terry.
   Anderson probably is unaware of one other death: Ali Ayub, who
sources say led the kidnap gang, was killed in a Beirut shootout
with rival militiamen later in 1985.

   The administration, while banning imports of
semiautomatic assault weapons pending review of their usage, sees no
need for similar review of domestically produced weapons, the White
House said today.
   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush is not
willing to expand the ban and review the administration announced
Tuesday to block import of semiautomatics that are not for sporting
use.
   ``At this point we are not willing to extend that,'' Fitzwater
told reporters. Although some of the assault weapons produced and
sold in the United States are virtually identical to the imports,
the spokesman said no curtailment of their manufacture is currently
envisioned.
   ``We don't see any need for any review or any other changes at
all,'' he said. However he did not preclude eventually expanding the
review.
   ``We're saying here's an issue that's come to light. We need to
deal with it and we'll see where we go,'' he said.
   Administration officials describe the ban on imports of AK-47s
and other semiautomatic firearms as ``temporary and reversible.''
But they say it was necessary to head off an imminent flood of the
assault weapons into the United States.
   The action Tuesday appeared to be a softening of Bush's
oft-stated opposition to gun controls, but Fitzwater said it merely
enforces current law that allows imports of guns only if for
sporting purposes.
   Bush, a member of the National Rifle Association, ``shares the
public concern'' over the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons,
but he is not changing his position against a ban on such guns,
Fitzwater said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle told The Associated Press today that he
had received several ``inquiries'' from people who were concerned
about the administration action.
   Quayle declined to elaborate, but he said Bush ``was absolutely
right to enforce the existing regulations we have ... I see it as a
serious attempt by President Bush to review the situation.''
   Bush had asked national drug control director William J. Bennett
last week to recommend what should be done about the weapons. Calls
for a ban have been prompted by scores of drug-related shootings and
the recent killing of five California schoolchildren.
   The action will affect more than 110,000 weapons with pending
applications for import, Bennett said, including AKS-type firearms
such as AK-47s, Uzi carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well
as Steyr Aug semiautomatic weapons.
   It does not affect semiautomatic weapons already in this country
or those produced domestically such as the AR15, the civilian
version of the military's .223-caliber M-16.
   The decision to suspend imports was made a day after Bennett was
sworn in to his new job. Stephen E. Higgins, director of the
Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, had
raised the issue with Bennett.
   ``Higgins mentioned to him this spike, this upsurge in import
applications, and outlined for Bennett what the legal authorities
and options were,'' said Bennett spokesman Don Hamilton.
   ATF approved the import of 88,000 such weapons during 1986, 1987
and 1988. This year alone, the government has received requests to
import many more than that, with 113,732 applications pending,
according to Bennett.
   After several more conversations with Higgins and others, ``his
thinking was developing along the lines of, this was a temporary and
reversible measure,'' Hamilton said.
   ``If we keep them out, it's temporary and reversible,'' he said.
``If, on the other hand, you let them in, they're in, and it's
irreversible. In the space of several weeks, you could more than
double the last three year's imports by doing nothing.''
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady _ whose department includes ATF
_ agreed to the import suspension and ordered it Tuesday.
   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weapons
into the United States, to make sure they fall into certain
categories,'' spokesman Dick Pedersen said. ``We're saying some of
these weapons may not fall into some of the prescribed categories,
such as hunting.''
   Gun control advocates hailed the move, while even the NRA _ which
has opposed controls on the weapons _ said it could do some good.
   The action would ``put a stop to the media hysteria surrounding
the semiautomatic version of the AK-47 rifle, and should provide an
atmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue,'' said
Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRA Institute for
Legislative Action.
   Before the suspension announcement, NRA President Joe Foss
decried the ``panic'' over semiautomatic weapons and blamed a faulty
criminal justice system for the current state of affairs in which
heavily armed drug dealers operate within minutes of the White House.
   ``If you think that taking away the guns from those bozos will
make any difference, you've got another thing coming,'' Foss said.
``You could outlaw every single gun that there is, and they would
still get them.''
   Handgun Control spokeswoman Susan Whitmore called the decision a
``first step toward public safety.''
   ``It's really significant that there's general recognition of the
problem that these combat weapons pose to the safety of not only the
nation's law enforcement community but to the citizens all across
the country,'' she said.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has introduced legislation
that would ban new assault weapons and require registration of those
already in circulation, said the import ban is ``a major first
step.''
   ``But currently, nothing prevents the manufacture of these
weapons here in the United States,'' Metzenbaum said. ``It is
necessary that we ban the sale of new assault weapons and register
the ones already in circulation.''
   The move came a day after the California State Assembly passed a
ban on 40 types of semiautomatics; the state Senate had passed a
similar bill earlier.

<DATELINE>TABA, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Egypt took control of the Red Sea resort of
Taba from Israel on Wednesday amid shouts of joy from Egyptians and
cries of protest from Israeli hotel workers who burned tires on a
nearby hillside.
   Some of the 200 Egyptian workers, sightseers and border policemen
shouted ``Allahu Akbar,'' or ``God is great!'' as the black, white
and red flag of Egypt was raised over Taba. Many joined in singing
the Egyptian national anthem, ``My country, my country.''
   Israeli hotel workers protested the transfer, setting tires set
ablaze on a nearby hill. They said they had no assurances about
employment under the Egyptians.
   The handover came hours after a raid by two Palestinian
guerrillas who sneaked across the Egyptian border and hurled a hand
grenade at an Israeli army post in the occupied Gaza Strip before
being wounded and captured. No Israeli soldiers were hurt.
   Also Wednesday, Jewish settlers accompanied by tractors and
mobile homes built a new settlement in the occupied West Bank, and
one settler leader said the construction was a response in part to
Israel's withdrawal from Taba.
   The raid and settlement construction appeared to be attempts by
both Jewish and Palestinian extremists to mar the transfer, which
ended seven years of bitter squabblng between Israel and Egypt.
   Minutes after Israel handed over the 250-acre strip of beach,
Egyptian immigration officials set up tents at the new border marker
to handle traffic.
   Egyptian workers put finishing touches on a new border gate and
immigration building, which were to be finished by Sunday when
President Hosni Mubarak will attend a more festive flag-raising
celebration.
   Mubarak, in Bonn on Wednesday, was asked by Israel radio if he
had a message for Israelis regarding Taba. He said: ``Peace and
peace. It is so important to human beings, so important to the
Israelis and to the Arabs and to human beings all over the world. It
is worth whatever concession. So we should be much more flexible
with each other so that each country can reach a lasting settlement
forever.''
   Israel had retained control of Taba when it pulled out of the
rest of the Sinai in 1982 under the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty of
1979.
   An international arbitration panel awarded Taba to Egypt in
September, and in February Egypt and Israel signed agreements that
include $37 million in compensation for the Israeli owner of Taba's
main hotel, the Sonesta.
   An Israeli official said no parallels should be drawn between the
return of Taba and calls for Israel to withdraw from the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
   ``Here it is obvious,'' said Yitzhak Lior, deputy director
general of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. ``We had a bone of
contention with a country with which we have peace. There it is
different.''
   Ahmed Masery, Egypt's consul general in Eilat, told Israel radio
the transfer should lead to better relations. ``I hope this will be
a bridge to peace, peace between the two peoples,'' he said.
   On Tuesday night, the Israelis took down their blue and white
flag and did not raise it again before the handover Wednesday,
apparently to avoid a simultaneous lowering and raising of flags.
   As Egyptian police and troops carrying rifles entered the resort
in groups of three, dozens of Israeli buses, police vehicles and
cars drove out of Taba along with about 50 protesting hotel workers
who sang Israel's national anthem, ``Hatikva,'' or ``Hope.''
   Israeli workers at Taba's 326-room Sonesta Hotel chanted in
protest shortly before the transfer. Several were arrested.
   Elan Ester Hazy, a leader of the hotel union, said: ``We have
nothing against the Egyptian government. On the contrary, it is
their right. I'll be ready to work with the Egyptians, but under
proper terms.''
   Egyptians were jubilant, running up the rocky hills overlooking
the Red Sea and roaming curiously around the hotel grounds. Some
bought souvenirs in the hotel shop, which began accepting Egyptian
currency Wednesday.
   ``We came from Nueiba just to watch,'' said Mervat El-Qassar, who
drove 40 miles from her home town with her family.
   At the border, a huge sign saying ``Welcome'' in English and
Arabic hung outside the Egyptian immigration tent.

   A bomb went off today at the British
Council Library, tearing a two-foot hole in the roof. A library
official linked the blast to Moslem outrage over Salman Rushdie's
novel ``The Satanic Verses.''
   No one was injured. All 12 employees had left the building at the
time of the explosion, which occurred shortly before 9 p.m.
   Abdul Haq, a library official, said the library had no warning of
the attack. However, he noted that British establishments have been
on alert because of threats against Rushdie.
   ``We were always thinking of a mob attack,'' said Haq. ``We never
thought of a bomb blast.''
   Rushdie, whose book is considered blasphemous by many Moslems, is
a British citizen. Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has
ordered Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   The British Council, which runs libraries and schools, is an
independent, non-political organization established in 1934 to
promote Britain abroad. It is partially funded by the British
government.

   Christian army units and Syrian-backed
Moslem militias fought intermittent battles with automatic rifles
and howitzers in Beirut and southeast of the capital on Wednesday.
   A police spokesman said 43 people have been killed and 129
wounded since early Tuesday, when fierce fighting broke out in and
around Beirut.
   The fatalities included seven Syrian soldiers and four soldiers
from Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000-strong regular Christian force, said
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with standing rules.
   The latest fatalities raised to 49 dead and 161 wounded the
overall toll since March 8, when clashes began. The fighting is the
worst since 1985 in the 14-year-old civil war between Moslems and
Christians.
   The clashes began after Aoun imposed a blockade on illegal ports
two Moslem militias use to import arms and supplies and to generate
revenue. They in turn shelled legal ports run by Aoun's units and
bombarded Christian districts.
   Aoun, who also heads the Christian cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, said Tuesday his troops were fighting ``a war of
liberation against Syrian occupation forces'' that will continue
until all Syrian troops left Lebanon.
   He blamed the shelling on the Syrians and said they pounded both
the Moslems and Christians.
   The Syrians, with 40,000 troops deployed in mostly Moslem sectors
of the country, are Lebanon's main power brokers. They support the
Moslem cabinet of Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Hoss, a Sunni Moslem, blamed the barrage on Aoun and accused him
of committing unspecified massacres. Hoss, in a memorandum, asked
the Arab League to dispatch a ``committee to investigate the
horrible massacre.''
   Police said Christian army units and Moslem militias sporadically
exchanged automatic rifle fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line
on Wednesday.
   In Moslem west Beirut, a bomb exploded under a car near the
American University, shattering windows in surrounding buildings. a
police spokesman said. No casualties were reported.
   The college campus and the parking lot at the adjacent American
University Hospital each took a direct hit in Tuesday's ferocious
shelling, but also incurred no casualties, the spokesman said.
   Smoke billowed Wednesday from pine and oak woods in the
army-controlled resort of Souk El-Gharb and the adjacent Druse
hamlet of Aitat, base for Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist
Party militia, southeast of the capital.

   ``I have three children to feed,'' said Wafaa Wehbe, a woman in
Moslem west Beirut. ``I must find bread, meat and vegetables.''
   Most families in Moslem west and Christian east Beirut spent
Tuesday night in basements and bomb shelters despite a relative lull
that prevailed. Beirut's sea and air ports remained closed for the
second day.
   Tuesday's fierce battle around Beirut between Aoun's troops and
Syrian-backed militiamen started as people headed to work. Howitzer
shells and rockets slammed into crowded streets at rush-hour and
blasted cars to bits.
   Ships left port and planes of the Lebanese national carrier, flew
to Larnaca, Cyprus, to escape shelling at Beirut's international
airport.
   The blockade imposed March 6 by Aoun's forces angered Jumblatt,
whose forces run two illegal ports south of Beirut, and Shiite
Moslem leader Nabih Berri, whose Amal militia operates one port in
south Beirut.
   Aoun's blockade prevented foreign ships from docking at the
illegal ports, preventing Jumblatt and Berri from collecting customs
duties. The militias use these ports to bring in arms and supplies
as well as imported goods that are taxed and sold in the areas they
control.
   Jumblatt and Berri retaliated by shelling the ports of Beirut and
Jounieh, northeast of Beirut, both legal harbors run by Aoun's
Christian units.
   The militias also bombarded Aoun's Defense Ministry and other
Christian districts, which in turn forced Aoun's army to retaliate.

<HEAD>Senate Subcommittee Chairman Reintroduces Fairness Doctrine Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel K. Inouye on Wednesday reintroduced
a Fairness Doctrine bill for broadcasters and then listened to
experts debate whether it is necessary in this diverse media age to
make stations air all sides of controversial issues.
   The Senate bill, with a half-dozen co-sponsors, matched
legislation already introduced in the House that would write into
law the Federal Communications Commission's 40-year-old rules that
the FCC repealed in 1987.
   The bill is expected to pass easily again this year, as it did
last year, and then face another presidential veto.
   Inouye, a Democrat from Hawaii who is chairman of the Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee's communications
subcommittee, said the need for the bill was greater than ever. He
cited a recent article in Broadcasting magazine that ``concluded
that in the last year there has been a decrease in the amount of
time devoted to broadcast station editorials.''
   But Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., the top GOP member of the
subcommittee, said ``arguments for the Fairness Doctrine get weaker
and weaker.''
   Packwood said the doctrine first was promulgated in the 1940s on
the idea that the radio and television spectrum was limited.
   ``There were certainly fewer broadcasters than there are now ...
no cable, no videocassette recorders. Today we have such a plethora
of access to information that one is hard-pressed to say that if
every radio station in the country, every television station in the
country is not compelled by law to follow a content doctrine where
we impose the content that somehow the public is not going to be
well-informed.''
   But Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said the number of outlets was not
the issue, it was the number of people a single outlet can reach in
an era in which, according to polls he cited, Americans watch an
average of four hours of TV daily and half the public gets all of
its news from television.
   ``I think that the broadcast (medium) has a unique role in its
ability to affect the thinking of the American people that's simply
not shared by the print media,'' Danforth said.
   But one witness before the panel, Thomas G. Krattenmaker of the
Georgetown University Law Center, said the doctrine was ``misguided
regulatory policy'' that tries to make ``every station behave in a
perfect way, to provide news and information for everyone who might
want that type of news or information in that listening market.''
   ``That's like telling a shoe store that it must provide every
kind of shoe that anybody might want to buy,'' Krattenmaker said.
   Jerome Baron of the George Washington University National Law
Center disagreed, saying the age of diverse media outlets has not
arrived and that cable is an ``unequal rival'' to broadcasting.
   ``Cable is now in its early adolescence,'' Baron said. ``If we
measure the contribution of cable from what it has in its own voice
been able to say, I don't think it's said very much.''
   ``I'm skeptical about claims that these new media will greatly
diminish the importance and power of the established prestige
media,'' he said.
   Scott Denman of the Safe Energy Communication Council questioned
claims that the Fairness Doctrine ``chilled'' discussion of
controversial issues. He said his group's surveys had found the
doctrine ``actually encourages more, and never less, coverage of the
issues,'' especially news.
   But he said very few broadcasters will actively seek opposing
points of view when it involves paid political advertising.
   Professor Anna Goldoff of the City University of New York said
her survey of 22 New York City radio and TV stations found that just
two of them considered the doctrine to have a chilling effect, while
82 percent said it had no effect one way or another.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., challenged that view.
   ``I know of several cases where the chilling effect was clearly
evident in a (political) race that I was in and several others,''
McCain said, noting that small radio stations facing large
attorneys' fees to defend themselves ``just opt out.''
   ``They just play music and that solves their problem, and
therefore the people within broadcast range of them don't receive
information on controversial issues,'' McCain said.

<HEAD>Baker Says Israeli-PLO Dialogue Should Not Be Ruled Out</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Top 7 grafs new with Baker clarification on PLO-Israeli dialogue;
picks up 4th graf pvs, The subject.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
clarifying an earlier statement, said today the possibility of an
Israeli-PLO dialogue should not be ``categorically'' ruled out
because it might some day make a contribution to peace.
   Elaborating on remarks he made Tuesday, Baker indicated in
testimony to the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on foreign
operations that he felt the prospects for such a dialogue were
remote.
   Under questioning from Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., Baker said he
only meant to say in his earlier remarks that such a dialogue should
not be ``categorically, absolutely, totally and completely'' ruled
out because it might help the peace process.
   In testimony Tuesday before a House subcommittee, Baker said it
may some day be necessary for Israel to talk to the PLO to settle
the Palestinian problem, leaving the impression among some that U.S.
policy on that issue might be shifting.
   He told the House panel the overall U.S. aim is direct and
meaningful negotiations.
   ``Now,'' he said, ``if you can't have direct negotiations that
are meaningful that do not involve negotiations with the PLO, I
suppose we would then have to see negotiations between Israelis and
representatives of the PLO.''
   Baker, testifying today before the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on foreign operations, clarified his earlier remarks by
suggesting that an Israeli-PLO dialogue was little more than a
hypothetical possibility.
   The subject is touchy. Israel refuses to deal with the PLO,
holding it responsible for bloody terrorist attacks on civilians,
diplomats and soldiers.
   In Israel, Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southern
command, said PLO chairman Yasser Arafat was aware of a ring of Arab
guerrillas that crossed the Egyptian border today and attacked an
Israeli military outpost in the occupied Gaza Strip with rifles and
hand grenades. Two teen-age fighters were wounded and captured.
   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, who is holding talks here, accused
the PLO on Tuesday of committing the ``worst atrocities we've ever
seen since World War II.'' He said the dialogue the United States
opened last December with Yasser Arafat's organization had
strengthened the PLO's hand.
   But Baker testified: ``It may be that you can have meaningful
negotiations that do not involve the PLO, it may be that you can't.
Our policy is simply that we think there needs to be direct
negotiations which are meaningful between Israelis and
Palestinians.''
   Baker's statement appeared to mark another turn in an evolving
U.S. policy toward the PLO. After several unsuccessful efforts to
meet with Palestinians not identified with Arafat's group, the
Reagan administration last December dropped a 13-year ban on talking
to the PLO.
   It acted after Arafat made public statements urged on him by the
State Department renouncing terrorism and accepting Israel's right
to exist.
   The Bush administration, which took office Jan. 20, continued the
dialogue despite several raids by PLO guerrillas against Israelis in
southern Lebanon and last week approved visas for PLO officials to
participate in a Mideast conference in New York.
   This week, Baker has put increasing emphasis on a need for
Israeli talks with Palestinians, and in his testimony said the
sessions might have to be held with the PLO in order to be
meaningful.
   Arens, at a news conference in a downtown hotel, declined to
comment on Baker's statement, saying he had not heard it directly.
But he again ruled out any Israeli government talks with the PLO,
which he accused of murdering Israelis and Palestinians and
threatening the regime of King Hussein of Jordan.
   Arens said the dialogue begun by the United States in December
gave the PLO ``a sense of legitimacy'' and ``strengthens an
organization that is actively engaged in terrorism.''
   Arens said he did not urge a suspension of the talks in his
meetings on Monday with President Bush and Baker. And, he said, Bush
and Baker did not ask Israel to deal with the PLO.
   But the visiting Israeli official criticized the U.S. opening to
the PLO. ``That dialogue gives them a sense of legitimacy,'' he
said. Arens said terrorist acts by the PLO had increased since the
U.S. talks opened.
   ``Giving them an image of being strengthened by recognition is
counterproductive,'' the Israeli foreign minister said.
   Arens said the United States and Israel should focus their
peacemaking drive on Hussein and provide him with ``incentives'' to
negotiate over the future of the West Bank and Gaza, the
predominantly Arab territories Israel has held since the 1967
Six-Day war.
   He called Jordan and Palestinian residents ``the legitimate
interlocutors'' with Israel and pledged that ``we in Israel will
make every effort to move the peace process forward. We do not need
any urging.''

<HEAD>`Bloom County' Creator and Crayola Crayons Engage in New Colorful
Exchange</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EASTON, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartoonist Berke Breathed has poked fun at
Crayola crayons once again, but the crayon maker says things aren't
as black and white as they appear in ``Bloom County.''
   In January, Breathed drew a strip in which a black child wanting
to draw a self-portrait contemplated a crayon whose color was
labeled ``flesh.''
   But Binney &amp; Smith, Inc., makers of the crayons, sent a letter to
Breathed noting that it had changed the label from ``flesh'' to
``peach'' in 1963, partially as a result of the civil rights
movement.
   In strips appearing in Tuesday's newspapers, Breathed
acknowledged the error, but targeted another color still used:
indian red.
   In the latest episode, the cartoon's fictional chief executive
officer, W.A. Thornhump, says the company ``was accidentally
mentioned here as selling racially insensitive pink crayons labeled
`flesh.'' He continues it was ``a grave and foolish mistake. Crayola
hasn't had `flesh' since 1963.''
   Then, another character, the penguin Opus, notes, ``It does have
`indian red,' tho.''
   Crayola does have an ``indian red,'' Binney &amp; Smith spokesman
Brad Drexler said Tuesday, but it does not refer to anyone's skin
color.
   ``It was used to describe the ground early American Indians used
in various projects,'' he said, citing pottery.
   Webster's Third New International Dictionary defines indian red
as ``a yellowish red ferruginous earth containing hematite and used
as a pigment.'' It's spelled with a lowercase ``i'' by both
Webster's and Binney &amp; Smith.
   Drexler shrugged off Breathed's latest barb, saying, ``I guess
he's trying to get the last word in on the Crayola story.''
   Ironically, it was Binney &amp; Smith that provided Breathed with his
latest ammunition.
   Al Leeds, sales manager of the Washington Post Writers Group,
which syndicates ``Bloom County,'' said Breathed found the ``indian
red'' crayon in a shipment of crayons the Forks Township company
sent to prove it no longer used ``flesh'' on its crayons.

<TEXT>
   Poles lined up in droves at the new
foreign-exchange window of a downtown bank Wednesday, the first day
they could legally buy dollars with their zlotys.
   Instead of the official exchange rate of 570 zlotys to the
dollar, the state-owned PKO bank was offering dollars at a ``free
market'' rate of 3,000 zlotys.
   None of the customers seemed to mind. They were happy to have the
greenbacks at any price.
   Until now, they were banned by law from buying dollars with their
zlotys, and had to avail themselves of the ubiquitous black market.
   The bank also was selling zlotys at a rate of 2,900 for $1 _ a
boon for those Poles who earn hard currency abroad or who provide
goods or services for hard currency. That window was less frenzied,
however.
   No personal identification was required at the bank and no
questions were asked about where their money came from.
   Demand for dollars is strong in Poland because the best material
goods, ranging from houses and cars to imported electronics
equipment and infant formula, usually are available only for dollars
or other hard currency.
   Poles who travel to the West also need hard currency to spend,
since the zloty cannot be traded abroad.
   The state-run news agency said the new foreign currency law is
intended to end ``the legal fiction'' of the official exchange rate
for private transactions.
   The law is part of the government's broader effort at economic
reform, which has a goal of strengthening Poland's notoriously weak
currency, devalued regularly on Mondays. Officials hope the zloty
will eventually find its correct level.
   Before Wednesday, legally obtained dollars could be converted by
Poles to zlotys only at the unrealistic official rate _ far too low
to be attractive. There was no legal way to buy dollars with zlotys.
   For now, foreigners still are banned from engaging in the free
currency market and are obliged to use the more disadvantageous
official rate of 570 zlotys for $1.
   Economic authorities say making the zloty fully convertible
immediately would be too much of a shock to the economy, so for now
they are trying only ``internal convertibility'' among Poles.
   PKO bank officials said four of its branches in Warsaw were
trading in currencies, as well as banks in other cities.
   Krzysztof Najgrodzki, manager of the capital's main PKO branch,
said he regretted he couldn't spare more tellers, ``but we are a
savings bank and we have to attend to our regular customers.''
   Najgrodzki said the exchange rate would be watched closely and
could be adjusted even during the course of a day to ``balance
delivery to demand.''
   It was too early to say how big the business would prove for the
bank, he said. The PKO generally plans to sell as many dollars as it
receives, but, ``You can't sell what you don't have.''
   Najgrodzki and his assistant, Robert Marianski, said the new law
allows Poles to do legally something that many have been doing
illegally for years.
   Marianski said the bank is under no illusion that black-market
trading will stop. ``The black market was, is and will be,'' he said.
   The dozens of people pressed around the exchange window
repeatedly were beckoned by many black-market operators milling
around in the bank. Some people even left the line to take advantage
of the black-marketeers' faster service.
   Rajmond, a 36-year-old operator who appeared to be the chief
black marketeer present, sauntered up to a Western reporter and said
the black-market traders were offering the same rate as the bank,
but without having to stand in line.
   For the traders, he said, the only difference now is that the
bank can set the ceiling on the exchange rate. They won't charge
more for dollars than the bank, but they will charge less when they
must in order to generate business.
   ``It's a capitalist life for us. I am a businessman,'' he said
philosophically as his helpers worked the crowd. ``For us, it's
America.''

   Discovery's astronauts overcame a
sticky valve in the electrical system and began restoring full power
to the space shuttle today, dispelling any need to cut short the
five-day mission, NASA said.
   The shuttle started drawing fuel again from the hydrogen tank
that had been closed because of the valve, said Al Pennington, a
flight director.
   ``We're repowering back up at this time,'' he said. ``It appears
that the tank is back in operation, which means we're back on a
nominal time line.''
   The valve, which started jamming shortly after the launch Monday,
had forced the crew to dim lights and shut down unneeded computers
to conserve power. The astronauts were in no danger, but officials
said the problem could have forced the shuttle to return to Earth on
Friday, one day early.
   Pennington made his announcement at a news briefing after a
heater in the hydrogen tank was activated to see if this would coax
the valve to work properly.
   Mission Control reported to the astronauts, ``The tank heaters
are looking real good.''
   ``OK,'' said Discovery commander Michael L. Coats. ``That's good
news.''
   The tank is one of three that supply the shuttle's
electricity-generating fuel cells. Without the tank, the shuttle
would not have enough power for five days in space plus the two days
set aside for contingencies.
   Despite a dim cabin and a careful use of electrical power, the
astronauts kept to their schedule of conducting experiments and
photographing environmentally damaged places on Earth during their
second morning in space.
   They focused a powerful 70mm camera on the Tanzanian plains in
Africa and then looked for evidence of pollution near Zanzibar,
where a coral reef is dying. Other targets included the scars from a
recent fire in the Everglades and an erupting volcano in Guatamala.
   While over Australia, then in darkness, Coats turned Discovery to
get TV views of what he called ``spectacular thunderstorms.''
   ``Every so often you can see a chain of lightning go off just
like a string of firecrackers,'' he said.
   Coats focused a television camera on crewmates Dr. James M.
Bagian and Robert C. Springer as they made a minor repair on a
experiment and vacuumed away debris.
   ``Bob and I almost had a fight over the vacuum cleaner,'' Bagian
joked. ``We are the prime operators of that instrument and we wanted
a chance to show off our prowess.''
   The official wakeup call was a full brass band rendition of the
Marine Corps Hymn played with gusto and volume.
   ``We got two Marines standing at attention up here,'' joked
Coats, a Navy captain. ``What do we do now?''
   Astronauts James F. Buchli and Springer are Marine colonels.
Bagian is a physician; John E. Blaha is an Air Force colonel.
   Within hours of Discovery's launch Monday, the astronauts
deployed a $100 million Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the final
link in a network that will give almost unbroken radio contact with
shuttles and other satellites.
   Discovery's flight is the first of seven shuttle voyages planned
for this year. The mission is the third for the shuttle since the
1986 Challenger disaster that killed seven astronauts and grounded
the shuttle fleet until September.

<HEAD>IRS Says Its Error Rate _ 31 Percent or 40 Percent _ Is Unacceptable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is giving the
wrong answer to telephoned tax questions 40 percent of the time _
not the 31 percent claimed by the IRS, government auditors said
Wednesday.
   In a rare public airing of a dispute between government agencies,
the IRS told a congressional panel that both figures can be
justified, denied attempting to mislead anyone and said there is no
pride in either error rate.
   ``As far as the IRS is concerned, whether we are answering 30
percent of the questions wrong or 40 percent of the questions wrong,
either number is absolutely unacceptable,'' said Robert LeBaube, IRS
director of taxpayer services.
   The dispute between IRS and the General Accounting Office, an arm
of Congress, is over how to judge the accuracy of answers that IRS
telephone ``assistors'' give to some of the 62 test questions that
will be posed clandestinely by other IRS employees 15,000 times this
filing season.
   ``Many of the answers IRS wants to score as `right' are
incomplete and potentially misleading,'' Jennie Stathis of GAO told
the House Government Operations subcommittee on consumer affairs.
``Such answers would increase the likelihood of taxpayers making
errors.''
   In reporting the 31 percent error rate, the IRS disregarded an
agreement with GAO over how the answers should be scored, Ms.
Stathis said.
   Members of the subcommittee found the dispute troubling, but said
they were even more concerned about the error rate. ``We cannot
tolerate a situation in which the very agency which is charged with
the enforcement of our tax laws is responsible for providing
erroneous information to taxpayers attempting to comply with those
laws,'' said Rep. J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
   LeBaube advised taxpayers who call the IRS toll-free numbers to
write down their question, the date and name of the person who
provided the answer. If an answer leads to an incorrect tax return
and the taxpayer produces such a record, LeBaube said, the IRS will
waive any penalty.
   The subcommittee, chaired by Rep. Doug Barnard Jr., D-Ga., is
concerned about the dispute because the IRS and GAO, which in past
years had done separate tests of the telephone-assistance program,
agreed to work together on a single test this year. The IRS would
make the test calls, using questions worked out with GAO, and GAO
would monitor the results.
   The two agencies agreed on 62 questions and set up three
categories for scoring the answers: ``correct,'' the minimum
standard IRS expected its assistors to meet; ``correct and
complete,'' and ``incorrect.''
   After a few weeks of conducting the test, LeBaube said, the IRS
determined there should be a new category to cover about 8 percent
of the answers that, while not technically correct were sufficient
to allow a taxpayer to file a correct return.
   Such an answer might be given after the assistor asked probing
questions to assure the taxpayer was not leaving out essential
information.
   ``For example,'' LeBaube said, ``if the test caller says he is
from Des Moines, Iowa, speaks with a Midwest accent and asks whether
he can still be claimed on his parents' return, the assistor may
probe to determine age, income, whether he was in school and how
much support his parents provided.
   ``However, the assistor probably would not ask whether he was a
U.S. citizen. The failure to ask this might not meet our mutually
agreed-upon standard,'' LeBaube added. ``However, the assistor would
in all probability be providing an answer that would allow the
taxpayer to prepare his return correctly.''
   After GAO refused to change its scoring method to accept such
responses as correct, IRS decided on its own to count them as right.
Without informing GAO, the IRS held a news conference Friday to
announce that assistors were giving the correct answer 69.2 percent
of the time.
   ``In retrospect, and in fairness to GAO, we probably should have
announced both numbers,'' LeBaube said.
   He insisted, however, that ``the public is misled if you do not
characterize those answers (in dispute) as ... ones that would lead
to a correct return.''
   The IRS has about 5,000 employees, including 1,500 temporaries,
answering toll-free telephone calls for assistance. They must be
high school graduates and receive at least five weeks' tax training.

   A 14th chair was pulled up to the Cabinet table
today with the formation of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and
President Bush noted that its new head started his government career
as an Army privte.
   The first secretary of veterans affairs, Edward J. Derwinksi,
took the oath of office in a private ceremony with Bush in the
Roosevelt Room of the White House.
   In a ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House immediately
afterward, Derwinksi told an audience of more than 500 people, many
of them wearing the caps of veterans' groups, that they had a right
to expect ``the best possible service.'' But he cautioned, ``This
isn't the world's best time in Washington for matters involving the
budget,'' a theme he has been sounding for weeks.
   Bush praised Derwinski as uniquely qualified to lead the new
agency because ``he has the skill of a seasoned legislator, the
patience of a practical administrator, the finesse of a diplomat and
the heart of a man who knows what it means to start his government
career as a private in the United States Army.''
   Derwinski is a former 12-term member of the House from Illinois
who served in high-level State Department posts in the Reagan
administration. He served in the Army in 1945-1946 and took part in
the occupation of Japan.
   The Veterans Department, formed from the old Veterans
Administration, is the second-largest agency of the government,
behind the Defense Department, with 240,000 employees. Its annual
spending of about $29 billion is the fifth largest among agencies.
It expects to keep the short title from its past, ``VA.''
   Veterans' organizations for years sought the greater clout they
thought Cabinet rank would give them, but it took an election-year
conversion by former President Reagan last year to put the idea
across.
   Derwinski has six months to make organizational changes he
believes necessary, but already he's decided they ``won't be
drastic.''
   In an interview earlier this week, he repeated a warning he has
been giving veterans' groups along with promises to drop in for a
beer at their local halls, that in the next four years ``there are
going to be some painful budget decisions.''
   ``My job is to see that the VA does better in the budget
infighting than it would have if I weren't aboard,'' he said.
   ``I don't believe in the short run we have any monumental
problems,'' Derwinski said. ``If there are shortfalls, it's mainly
because of the budget battle.''
   A year ago the National Academy of Public Administration said it
did not believe Cabinet status ``would significantly improve either
access to the president, the adequacy of necessary resources or the
organization, management and delivery of high-quality services and
benefits.''
   VA officials told Congress last year the $10.8 billion allocated
for medical care in this year's $29.8 billion VA budget would be at
least $600 million short. Most hospitals already have begun to
curtail care to veterans where they have discretion to do so.
   Some of the agency's medical issues have been making news for
years. An estimated 479,000 Vietnam veterans, one in five who served
there, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder bringing
flashbacks and disorientation.
   Much controversy and money have gone into studies of the Vietnam
defoliant Agent Orange, and the issue is not settled yet, though the
VA has said it can find no significant difference in cancer rates
between exposed veterans and others.
   ``The big problem is one, interestingly, where there is no
debate: aging,'' Derwinski said. ``The patients' needs start to
change. ... It ultimately means long-term health care rather than
dramatic surgical procedures.''
   There are more than 27 million veterans. Counting dependents, a
third of the nation is eligible for one or another of the services
provided by the huge, but fairly uncomplicated, bureaucracy
dispensing medical care and $17 billion a year in pensions and other
money benefits and operating 111 national ceremonies.
   With 172 hospitals, 229 outpatient clinics and scores of other
installations, the agency runs the largest medical care system in
the country, caring for 1.4 million hospital patients annually.
   The VA's motto comes from Lincoln's second inaugural address:
``To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow,
and his orphan.'' The agency traces its history to the Plymouth
Colony law of 1636 for the maintenance of members disabled in the
Pequot Indian war, though the VA was formed only in 1930 to
consolidate veterans program in other departments.

   A 14-year-old who shot and killed
himself in front of 21 classmates had undergone counseling for
undisclosed emotional problems earlier in the school year, the
principal says.
   Donald Payne shot himself in the head in a classroom at Jefferson
City High School on Tuesday, said police Sgt. Ray Bledsoe.
   The teen-ager had shown no unusual behavior the morning of the
shooting, said an administrator who talked with his parents, friends
and teachers.
   Bill Anthony, district director of secondary education, said the
boy's parents ``had not noticed anything abnormal about his mood or
activity that morning.''
   ``As far as they knew there had not been any girlfriend breakup
or any kind of loss in the family or any other problems in the
family,'' Anthony said.
   ``I have not heard anyone, either students, faculty or family,
that have indicated a reason'' for why the boy shot himself.
   However, Principal Richard Pemberton said school officials
recommended earlier in the school year that the boy's parents take
their son for counseling for emotional problems.
   Pemberton, who would not discuss the problems or the boy's
academic or disciplinary record, said the parents cooperated, and
the boy attended three days of sessions.
   The teen-ager had shown the .22-caliber pistol to friends before
school but said nothing before pulling the trigger as his science
class began, students told police. ``Nobody actually had seen him
come out with the gun,'' Bledsoe said.
   The students who were in the room received counseling from
administrators and psychiatrists, Pemberton said.
   Anthony said the boy's parents were sure he took the gun from
home.

   Business inventories continued their steady
rise in January, accompanied by healthy growth in sales, the
government said Wednesday in a report that showed continued strength
in the aging economic expansion.
   Inventories held on shelves and backlots rose 0.7 percent to a
seasonally adjusted $766.2 billion in January, the 25th straight
month in which inventories have increased, the Commerce Department
reported.
   Sales, meanwhile, rose 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $513.9
billion in January. The increase came despite a 1.7 percent drop in
auto sales that was accompanied by a 1.9 percent rise in stocks of
unsold cars during January.
   An advance report on February's retail sales said auto purchases
were down another 1.7 percent last month.
   Analysts said car purchases have been held down by rising
interest rates and reduced demand after strong sales last year.
Carmakers recently have boosted incentive offers in an effort to
spur sales, and General Motors Corp. has temporarily halted
production at two plants to reduce inventory.
   Overall, January's activity produced no change in the ratio of
business inventories to sales, which stood at 1.49, meaning it would
take 1.49 months to exhaust inventories at January's sales pace.
   Economist Robert DeFina of Security Pacific National Bank in Los
Angeles said the balance between inventories and sales signals
``continued moderate growth without the big imbalance that usually
precedes a major downturn.''
   Charles Renfro, chief economist at the Alphametrics forecasting
firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., said the figures suggest the economy is
``still moving ahead,'' but at a moderate pace that shouldn't add to
inflationary pressures.
   Rising inventories, if not accompanied by corresponding increases
in sales, can lead to production cutbacks that would hamper economic
growth. But recent growth in inventories generally has been
accompanied by rising sales, with autos being the exception.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, cautioned that businesses will have to be ``fast on their
feet'' to avoid an unwanted build-up of excess inventories in the
event of a sales slowdown.
   ``If demand doesn't remain as solid as it has been ...
inventories could quickly become heavy,'' Dederick said.
   January's increase in inventories included a 0.9 percent rise in
stocks held by manufacturers, a 0.2 percent boost in stockpiles at
the wholesale level and a 0.9 percent increase in inventories held
by retailers.
   The rise in sales included a 0.3 percent advance in sales by
manufacturers, a 2.3 percent increase at the wholesale level and a
0.7 percent increase in retail purchases, despite the slowdown in
car sales.
   Analysts said January's strong retail sales were due partly to
unusually mild weather that brought out more shoppers.
   February's advance report on retail sales, released Tuesday,
showed purchases were down 0.4 percent last month, held back by the
sharp drop in business at car dealerships.

<HEAD>Physician Practice Styles Influence Caesarean Rate</HEAD>
<HEAD>For Release at 6 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Individual physicians' styles of practice are an
important factor in determining whether pregnant women have
Caesarean sections, a study concludes.
   The doctors who conducted the study said that while their
findings were not a surprise, they were the first to document the
powerful influence of the so-called ``physician factor.''
   ``We demonstrated that given a very homogenous, low-risk,
affluent population, there was an extremely wide variation in the
rate of Caesarean section,'' said Dr. Gergory L. Goyert. ``The
conclusion is that an individual clinician is a major determinant of
the method of delivery.''
   The research was published in Thursday's issue of the New England
Journal of Medicine.
   The study, conducted at an unidentified community hospital in
suburban Detroit, was based on 11 obstetricians who delivered 1,533
babies during one year. Their rates of Caesarean section ranged from
19 percent to 42 percent. Among women who had not had previous
Caesareans, the rates ranged from 10 to 32 percent, depending on the
doctor.
   This variation could not be attributed to differences in the
patients, the degree of obstetrical risk or whether the physicians
had been sued recently for malpractice.
   The researchers could not prove that any of the Caesareans were
needless. However, the patients of doctors who did a lot of
Caesareans fared no better than those of physicians who performed
the operations more sparingly.
   Over the past two decades, the Casesarean rate in the United
States has increased from 5 percent of all births to 25 percent.
Many factors are thought to contribute to this increase, including
the safety of Caesareans, increasing concern for the welfare of the
fetus and fear of being sued if something goes wrong during a
vaginal delivery.
   The study did not determine why some doctors did more Caesareans
than others. ``I can only believe that they have the fetus's and
patient's best interests at heart,'' said Goyert, a physician at
Sinai Hospital of Detroit.

   Cleaning up contamination and radioactive waste
at the government's nuclear weapons plants may cost much less than
the $60 billion to $100 billion commonly estimated, Energy Secretary
James D. Watkins told Congress Wednesday.
   ``I believe we can do this for a lot less,'' Watkins told a
Senate Budget subcommittee in his first appearance on Capitol Hill
since his swearing in last week.
   Watkins did not make his own estimate but promised to produce
later this year a detailed blueprint, including cost projections,
for an initial five-year effort to clean up the weapons sites and
modernize the aging facilities in 12 states.
   The Energy Department, in an estimate published before Watkins
took over, said modernization and cleanup of the weapons complex
would cost at least $81 billion over the next 21 years. The General
Accounting Office has put the cost at more than $100 billion.
   In testimony before the Senate panel, Keith O. Fultz, the GAO's
director of energy issues, maintained that current cost estimates
probably were too low, given that no one yet knows how bad some of
the contamination is and the feasibility of cleanup.
   Watkins refuted this. He said scenarios for accomplishing the
cleanup often contain expensive, unneeded frills.
   Watkins also said he was confident his department could safely
restart the Savannah River Plant nuclear reactors in South Carolina,
which are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas
needed in the manufacture of nuclear warheads. The three reactors
there have been closed for nearly a year because of safety concerns.
   ``I believe we can get those reactors up,'' he said, adding that
he planned to meet soon with senior executives of Westinghouse
Electric Corp., which on April 1 takes over for E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co. as contract manager at Savannah River.
   The Energy Department and Westinghouse have said they would
produce a detailed plan for restarting the Savannah River reactors
by the end of this month.
   The timing of a restart at Savannah River is considered important
because the shutdown has raised questions about the adequacy of U.S.
tritium supplies.
   Watkins said he already was developing a plan that would get the
Savannah River reactors running again and keep them in safe
operation for at least a decade _ time enough to allow for the
construction of a new generation of reactors.
   He defended the Bush administration's plan for spending $6.8
billion to build two tritium-producing reactors, one at Savannah
River and the other in Idaho. Critics have said only one reactor, at
most, will be needed in the foreseeable future.
   Robert B. Barker, the Pentagon's assistant secretary for atomic
energy, told the panel the two new reactors would be capable of
producing 150 percent of the nation's tritium needs. He strongly
defended the plan, saying extra production capacity was needed to
guard against unforeseen technical or other problems.
   Across Capitol Hill, a House subcommittee sent to the full Energy
and Commerce Committee legislation to create an independent,
11-member board to oversee the cleanup of the government's nuclear
weapons plants.

<TEXT>
   During the 34-year reign of President
Alfredo Stroessner, his senior aides got rich through kickbacks and
fraud, court cases allege. Few Paraguayans doubt that ``El Viejo'' _
``the old man'' _ did, too.
   But the new government of Gen. Andres Rodriguez and the ruling
Colorado Party have expressed little interest in pursuing whether
Stroessner should be investigated.
   Rodriguez was a friend of Stroessner's, and his daughter, Marta,
is married to Stroessner's son, Alfredo. A trial also could prove
embarrassing to the party, which has held power since 1947.
   After the Feb. 3 coup, Foreign Minister Luis Maria Argana said
the country must ``look to the future and forget about the past.''
   No apparent efforts have been made since then to seize
Stroessner's assets, and a lawsuit seeking his return from exile in
Brazil to face possible corruption charges has languished in court.
   ``I see no political interest in trying Stroessner,'' said Oscar
Paciello, on leave as president of the Paraguay Bar Association.
``During his 34 years in power, a lot of people here today were by
his side and a trial would leave the altars without any saints.''
   Estimates of Stroessner's alleged ill-gotten gains run into the
hundreds of millions of dollars, although proof of that is as hard
to come by as evidence of what he did with any such money.
   After the coup, there were no discoveries of fabulous art
collections, luxurious hideaways, foreign bank accounts or closets
stuffed with furs, jewels and shoes, such as followed the flights to
exile of dictators Anastasio Somoza, Ferdinand Marcos and
Jean-Claude Duvalier.
   ``Stroessner was much more intelligent than Somoza, who had
businesses in his name,'' said journalist Ricardo Canese.
``Stroessner received commissions and dividends without ever
becoming part of the business itself, without any document bearing
his name.''
   The 76-year-old ex-army commander lived simply in this hot,
steamy South America capital since he took power in a 1954 coup. He
shunned a flamboyant lifestyle.
   Nevertheless, many Paraguayans, including Aldo Zuccolillo, editor
of the newspaper ABC Color, are convinced that a simple lifestyle
masked but did not hide Stroessner's systematic plundering.
   Zuccolillo alleges Stroessner allowed Refineria Paraguaya, S.A.,
to charge the government as much as twice the world price for oil
from 1974-79 and pocketed $800 million. ABC Color published the
scandal, leaving out the Stroessner connection for fear it would be
closed. It was closed anyway in 1984 and just now is reopening.
   ``Stroessner may barely have a $10,000 bungalow here in Paraguay,
but he has well over $1 billion overseas in secret accounts,''
alleges Zuccolillo.
   After the coup, Stroessner's long-time minister of public works,
Gen. Juan Antonio Caceres, said his former boss had personal
signature power over two funds totaling $4 million. The money came
from highway tolls and gasoline taxes, Caceres said, adding that his
ministry was denied the funds.
   A huge source of illegal commissions and overcharges was the
construction in the 1970s with Brazil of the $16 billion Itaipu dam
_ the world's largest hydroelectric project _ on the Parana River.
   There also were allegations of contraband: cigarettes and liquor
in the 1960s, stereos in the 1970s, computers and narcotics in the
1980s. This California-size country of 4 million people nestled
between Brazil, Argentina and Bolivia long has been a smugglers'
paradise.
   Five ex-Stroessner Cabinet ministers and seven senior aides and
party officials are accused of ``offenses against public
administration'' including embezzlement, bribery and fraud. Those
who have been charged have declared their innocence.
   Attorney Pedro Abilio Rolon alleges former Interior Minister
Sabino Augusto Montanaro sold passports to Koreans and Taiwanese for
$2,500 each, and former Health Minister Adan Godoy Jimenez charged
the government $40,000 to build each of more than 200 health clinics
that cost only $10,000.
   On Tuesday, former Justice Minister Jose Eugenio Jacquet was
brought to court on corruption charges. A police report accused him
of selling licenses to notaries and court clerks for $4,000 and said
he influenced court cases, ``which resulted in important economic
gains.''
   Jacquet's attorney, Ramon Alberto Aquino, said the charges were
vague, but he did not say how his client pleaded, if at all.
   Stroessner's aides used to say with pride and arrogance, ``Not a
leaf falls in Paraguay without Stroessner knowing it.''
   ``Stroessner is the head of all this, the mastermind,'' said
attorney Gladys Ramboado, who filed suit in criminal court demanding
that Stroessner be returned to face corruption charges.
   The suit has made little headway, and Ms. Ramoado admits she are
unsure they can ever force the government to try Stroessner.
   The provisional government has stressed Stroessner's
accomplishments in his early years and blamed greedy subordinates in
his later years.

<HEAD>Government Claims Hundreds of Guerrillas Killed in Fight for Jalalabad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Afghan jets bombed guerrilla positions
around Jalalabad on Wednesday, and Afghanistan's state-run radio
said hundreds of insurgents were killed in a failed attempt to
capture the strategic city.
   The guerrillas admitted that bombing by communist troops hampered
their advance on Jalalabad, but they claimed to have shot down five
airplanes and killed more than 100 government soldiers in the last
two days. They reported heavy civilian casualties from the bombing.
   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said
government air and ground forces repulsed the guerrillas after they
fired 5,000 rockets and shells in an attempt to take the city in
eastern Afghanistan.
   It said that over the previous 24 hours, 560 guerrillas and
supporters were killed and 252 were wounded. It said the dead
included four Americans, a Saudi national, and some Pakistanis.
   Pakistan, the United States and Saudi Arabia back the Moslem
guerrillas in their war with the communist government but deny
having any nationals fighting in Afghanistan.
   The battle for Jalalabad, 42 miles from the Pakistan border, is
the first test of strength of Kabul's communist rulers and their
opponents since the last Soviet soldiers left Afghanistan on Feb. 15.
   Its fall would be a blow to the morale of the mainly conscripted
army and a big boost to the guerrillas, who have been fighting 10
years to establish an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Observers believe a guerrilla victory could have a domino effect
on the country's other communist-held cities, including Kabul, the
capital.
   The guerrillas began their offensive March 6 and by last weekend
had captured the communist garrison at Samarkhel, six miles east of
Jalababad.
   The communists retaliated with heavy, high-altitude aerial
bombing.
   ``The (air) forces are taking a direct part in defending the
country and demolishing the gathering place of the invaders. ...
This success worried the enemy, and they are thinking: `These are
not Afghan pilots,''' Radio Kabul said Wednesday night.
   Guerrillas have claimed the fighter-bombers are piloted by
Soviets in violation of the U.N.-mediated accord that provided for
the Soviet withdrawal.
   Despite communist claims, guerrilla sources say they have lost
only about 150 men in the offensive and captured more than 700
government troops.
   Government and guerrilla versions of the fighting usually
contradict and tend to be exaggerated.
   However, journalists and witnesses have reported the battle for
Jalalabad has sent hundreds of wounded guerrillas and thousands of
civilians over the border into Pakistan.
   The guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency said insurgents also were
attacking communist posts around the northern city of Baghlan and
the southeastern city of Kandahar, the country's second-largest.
   It said attacks near Baghlan on Monday killed 70 communist
troops, wounded 50 and destroyed five tanks.

<HEAD>Life-Expectancy Disparity Between Whites, Blacks Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White Americans, benefitting from dramatic
declines across the population in heart disease and strokes, are
living longer than ever. But black Americans, increasingly the
victims of homicide and AIDS, are seeing their life expectancy fall
further.
   That is the picture painted by the latest tally of the nation's
health, released Wednesday. And there's more:
   Blacks are twice as likely to die in infancy as whites. Pregnant
black women receive early prenatal care far less than whites. Blacks
are disproportionately afflicted with influenza and pneumonia.
   Health Secretary Louis Sullivan said the report showed _ as the
statistics have since 1970 _ ``that there is a disparity between the
health of our white and black populations.''
   Dr. Manning Feinleib, director of the National Center for Health
Statistics, told reporters that the basic causes for blacks'
declining life expectancy relate to ``nutrition, poverty (and)
access to (health) care'' that affect ``a wide variety of conditions
from infant mortality to mortality at later ages.''
   One other likely cause Feinleib mentioned: drug-related murders.
   Buttressing that assessment, the death rate among black men,
frequently the victims of drug-related violence, was 50 percent
higher than for white men in 1986, the last year for which
comprehensive statistics were available.
   In all, the report, ``Health, United States,'' painted this
statistical picture for 1986:
   _A child born that year could expect to live 74.8 years, up from
74.7 years in 1985.
   _A white child had a life expectancy of 75.4 years in 1986, up
from 75.3.
   _But a black child born that year could expect to die at just
69.4 years, down from 69.5 in 1985 and 69.7 in 1984.
   Life expectancies were not calculated for other population groups.
   Much of the improvement in overall life expectancy was laid to
dramatic declines in heart disease and stroke, which have come about
largely because more and more Americans are giving up smoking or not
starting at all. Smoking is a risk factor for both diseases.
   From 1970 to 1986, deaths from heart disease fell 31 percent,
although the disease remains the leading cause of death in America.
During the same period, deaths from stroke, the third leading cause,
dropped 53 percent.
   Now, said Sullivan, the nation needs to focus more attention ``on
such critical areas as prevention of AIDS, unintentional injuries,
homicide and suicide.''
   As for AIDS, the report said that the percentage of males age 13
or older infected with the deadly virus rose at least 30 percent,
based on preliminary data, from 1987 to 1988.
   Among blacks, the AIDS infection rate rose 51 percent. Among
females, it skyrocketed 67 percent _ 42 percent among white females,
74 percent among blacks and 97 percent among Hispanics.
   Infant mortality was cut in half from 1970 to 1986 _ from 20
deaths per 1,000 births in 1970 to 10.4 per 1,000 births in 1986.
Preliminary data for 1987 and 1988, however, show the decline is
slowing. The mortality rate for black infants was 18 deaths per
1,000 births in 1986, compared with 8.9 per 1,000 births for whites.
   The report, a compilation of previously released material, also
said:
   _Substantially more white women, 79 percent, and women of Asian
and Pacific Islander descent, 76 percent, receive prenatal care in
the first three months of a pregnancy than black women, 62 percent,
or American Indian women, 61 percent. Among Hispanic women, early
prenatal care was highest among Cubans, 82 percent, and lowest among
Puerto Ricans, 57 percent.
   _Births among unmarried women more than doubled from 1970 to
1986, from 11 percent to 23 percent of all births. In 1986, 11
percent of women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent who gave
birth were unmarried, compared with 16 percent of white women, 42
percent of American Indian women and 61 percent of black women.
   _Accidents, including those involving motor vehicles, were the
fourth leading cause of death overall in 1986 and the most frequent
cause of death among men under the age of 65.
   _Although homicide ranks 12th among all causes for death, it
takes nearly as many lives as accidental injuries for black males
who die before age 65.
   _The suicide rate for white men in 1986 was nearly double that of
black men. On average, 21 of each 100,000 deaths among white men
were suicides, compared with 12 for black men, 5 for white women and
2 for black women.
   _Influenza and pheunomia caused 28 of each 100,000 deaths among
black men, far higher than the 18 per 100,000 rate posted for white
men. Among black women, 13 of each 100,000 deaths were caused by
influenza and pheunomia; among white women the number was 10.

<HEAD>Bond Set at $945,000 for Inmate Who Killed While Out of Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bail was set at $945,000 for a man accused of
hammering an elderly woman to death and severely injuring his
ex-girlfriend while he was out of jail on a two-day furlough.
   Police have since acknowledged that Edward Beets, 29, was
overheard in the North Las Vegas Jail, arguing by telephone with
someone later identified as the ex-girlfriend.
   Beets is charged with murder in the death Friday of Oretha Hames,
71, and the attempted murder of her daughter, Vanita Hames, 28, who
is listed in stable condition at University Medical Center.
   Beets was sentenced to 45 days in jail earlier this year for
trespassing and domestic battery at the girlfriend's house. He was
given a two-day pass to attend an aunt's funeral, and the attack
occurred while he was on furlough.
   North Las Vegas Municipal Judge Gary Davis, who has a reputation
of being one of the area's toughest judges, approved the pass. Davis
said Tuesday he would not change the furlough policy, because to do
so would penalize deserving inmates.
   ``I've been doing a lot of soul-searching,'' Davis said. ``Should
I punish everyone in the future because this man did something
horrible? It was a kindness to (Beets') family that turned into a
nightmare.''
   Davis had sentenced Beets to 45 days in jail on charges of
misdemeanor trespass at the Hames home. The judge said the city
prosecutor had only asked for 10 days. Police said Beets had been
arrested previously at the address for domestic battery and
trespassing.
   Police were called to the Hames home in the pre-dawn hours by
Vanita Hames' 8-year-old daughter who said her grandmother had been
knocked out. They found the elderly woman dead and her daughter
suffering from a fractured skull and hammer wounds to the neck,
chest, arms and legs.
   Assistant Police Chief Ron Lusch said jail guards overheard Beets
having an angry phone conversation with someone last week. Beets
later told a guard he had been talking to his girlfriend.
   Lusch said such phone arguments are ``not uncommon'' at the jail.
   ``We're governed by law that we can't monitor (inmates') phone
calls,'' he said. ``If we had any inkling of (danger), proper
authorities would have been notified.''
   Davis said police often inform him of unusual circumstances
involving prisoners, but did not do so with Beets.
   ``If we'd have had that information, it would have made a world
of difference in what we had done,'' Davis said.
   The judge believes, however, that even if Beets had been denied a
furlough, it might simply have delayed the inevitable.
   ``If that was his intention, I don't think if we kept him in a
week longer or two weeks longer, it would have made any
difference,'' Davis said.
   Beets is to be arraigned March 23 on the latest charges.

   The managers of an auditorium here have
cracked down on the chorus of winter coughers who have been crowding
out the music with their high-decibel hacks.
   The program for violinist Isaac Stern's performance at the
University of Iowa's Hancher Auditorium last week urged audience
members to calm their lungs.
   Ushers offered cough drops, but threatened to exile intransigent
coughers to soundproof booths.
   One member of the audience asked his neighbor, ``Are you ready?''
   ``Yes, I brought my cough drops,'' she whispered.
   The threat seemed to work.
   Barely a snivel competed with Stern's melodies, while the
sneezes, wheezing and barks swelled under the cover of applause
during breaks.
   The managers of the hall were haunted by a recent performance in
Buffalo, N.Y., by American soprano Jesse Norman, who was so
disturbed by coughing that she said to the audience: ``I hope you
can hear me as well as I can hear you.''
   ``I was really scared that that would happen at Hancher,'' said
Judith Hurtig, the hall's marketing director.
   Ms. Hurtig said she embarked on the cough reform campaign after
intense and constant coughing disturbed Japanese pianist Mitsuko
Uchida during a January concert at the auditorium.
   A local newspaper has dubbed crowds at the hall ``the Hancher
Hackers.''

   An unsung Paterson welder went into a
``bowling coma'' and emerged with a near-perfect score to claim the
most coveted record in the game.
   Tom Jordan left only two pins standing at the Garden State Bowl
in Union on March 7, with scores of 300, 299, 300 and 299 over four
games.
   If certified by the American Bowling Congress, Jordan's 899 for
the first three games would be the highest recorded, his 1,198 for
the four also setting a record.
   ``It just seemed like I was in a bowling coma,'' said Jordan, 22.
``I was pretty well focused on what I was doing.''
   Mark Miller, a spokesman for the Greendale, Wis.-based bowling
organization, said Tuesday he expected a decision within a week.
   ``It is probably the most prestigious record in bowling,'' Miller
said.
   The previous three-game record, set in October 1939 by Allie
Brandt of Lockport, N.Y., was 887. Pat Landry of Lansing, Mich.,
tied that record last November.
   Jordan's partner, Ken Yonker Jr., bowled a 756 for the first
three games, and the pair's total of 1,655 would eclipse the
national doubles record of 1,642. Jordan and Yonker are left-handed.

   New Yorkers eat out nearly twice as much as the
national average and favor Chinese when they order takeout meals.
   New York Newsday reported Wednesday that a poll conducted by The
Gallup Organization found that 74 percent of the city's residents
say they eat meals outside the home at least once a week.
   Some 22 percent said they had bought a takeout meal the day
before they were surveyed. Thirty-two percent favored Chinese food,
25 percent preferred Italian cuisine, including pizza, while 6
percent gave Mexican cooking the highest marks.
   A 1987 nationwide Gallup survey found only 4 percent had bought
Chinese food the previous day.
   Gallup interviewed 1,019 people ages 18 and over by telephone
Nov. 11-15 for the survey and reported a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
   Other findings:
   _ 39 percent of New Yorkers consider themselves overweight;
   _ 24 percent of New Yorkers say they are on a diet;
   _ 14 percent said they had purchased food from a street vendor in
the last week.

<HEAD>Anderson _ Determination in the Face of War</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Hostages, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Terry Anderson is a journalist who adapted smoothly to the
arduous life in Beirut, maintaining a sense of calm while going
about his job with determination and refusing to be intimidated by
the war around him.
   As he begins his fifth year as a hostage in Lebanon on Thursday,
accounts from freed hostages describe a man still making the best of
the worst circumstances, and trying to encourage others to do the
same.
   Anderson was born Oct. 27, 1947 in Lorain, Ohio. He went to high
school in Batavia, N.Y. and graduated from Iowa State University.
   He came to Beirut in the summer of 1982, recruited from the AP's
Johannesburg bureau to help cover the Israeli invasion. He returned
to South Africa but was back in Beirut in November as the bureau's
news editor.
   Anderson became the chief Middle East correspondent in August
1983.
   Six years in the Marines, including time in Vietnam, contributed
to a fearlessness that gave Anderson an aura of invincibility.
   He would listen to jazz tapes while maneuvering his car around
tanks in Beirut's war-torn streets. On some mornings, he would jog
or walk along the Mediterranean, accompanied only by his dog Jolie.
   When a visiting reporter once confessed she didn't know what a
rocket-propelled grenade was, Anderson approached a group of
militiamen dining at a restaurant and asked for a closer look at
their weapons.
   He was one of the first reporters on the scene when Shiite Moslem
suicide bombers blew up the U.S. Embassy and Marine barracks in west
Beirut in 1983.
   ``He was one of those people who seemed somehow invincible,''
said Robert Fisk of the Times of London, a friend of Anderson's.
``He had no reason to be frightened, because he had made no enemies
in Lebanon. If Terry Anderson could be abducted, then no one was
safe.''
   The illusion was shattered March 16, 1985, after Anderson played
a game of tennis. Three young men in a green Mercedes kidnapped him
at gunpoint. The pro-Iranian Shiite group Islamic Jihad claimed
responsibility.
   Anderson is the longest-held of the 15 foreigners in captivity in
Lebanon. His father and brother both died of cancer in 1986. He has
never seen his younger daughter, Sulome, born shortly after his
abduction.
   His family has little encouragement except accounts of freed
hostages who describe a man who has not lost his will.
   The Rev. Benjamin Weir, a Presbyterian clergyman who was released
by captors in September 1985 after 16 months as a hostage, told how
Anderson led worship services with other hostages and fashioned
flash cards from cheese wrappers so he could learn Arabic.
   Weir carried a letter from Anderson when he was freed in which
Anderson wrote that the hostages' main problem was keeping occupied.
He said the other men and the Bible ``have kept me sane.''
   Anderson, who had started himself on a health kick shortly before
being kidnapped, reportedly exercises and even wrestled with his
guard.
   In the Marines, Anderson was a combat correspondent in Vietnam
and worked as a reporter, anchorman and station manager for the
Armed Forces Radio and Television Service in Japan. He was
discharged as a staff sergeant and spent three years as a radio and
television newsman at KRNT and KCCI-TV in Des Moines, Iowa.
   Anderson joined The Associated Press after graduating from Iowa
State University, working in Detroit, Louisville, Ky., and New York
before taking overseas assignments to Tokyo, Johannesburg and
finally Lebanon.
   ``Terry once told me he just happened to get lucky, that he found
something that he liked and happened to be good at,'' said his
sister, Peggy Say. ``He really loved his job.''

   The sister of American journalist Terry
Anderson and a former hostage in Lebanon called Wednesday for
renewed attention to the plight of those still held captive in the
Mideast and urged conciliation with Iran.
   Peggy Say said she fears prospects for her brother's release have
worsened because his captors, pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists,
are angry about the publication of Salman Rushdie's novel ``The
Satanic Verses,'' which they consider blasphemous.
   ``Every event that takes place in the Middle East has the
potential effect. Hostages have died. Hostages have been executed.
So when things happen, the families are in an immediate panic,''
said Mrs. Say.
   She and the Rev. Lawrence M. Jenco, a hostage who was released in
1986, were interviewed on Cable News Network's Los Angeles-based
talk show ``Sonya.'' It was part of a series of appearances leading
up to Thursday's four-year anniversary of the day Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped in
Beirut.
   Anderson is the longest held of the 15 foreign hostages in
Lebanon. Nine are American.
   ``If this were a hundred Americans, would we be here on your
program today four years later debating what is the right thing to
do for these people?'' Mrs. Say asked. ``If we ignore nine today,
what will we ignore tomorrow? Will we then ignore 19 or 90? Some day
are we going to wake up and say, `My God, what's happened to our
world?'''
   She said the ``right thing'' was for the Bush administration to
open a dialogue with Iran and to seek reconciliation.
   A key element for the Americans' release would be a decision by
the United States to unfreeze Iranian assets it holds from arms
sales to the deposed shah, said Jenco.
   Mrs. Say said she believed her brother has been held hostage the
longest because he is a journalist.
   ``They counted on the fact that he is a journalist, that the
whole journalistic community would rise up in his defense as it has
for so many others,'' she said. ``They have never understood as I
guess I have never understood nor has Terry why that hasn't
happened.''
   Jenco said the United States should set an example for parts of
the world that don't understand America's ``framework of freedom.''
   ``In my own heart I believe that we should reflect to the world a
kinder, gentler nation, hoping that the world itself will become a
kinder, gentler world,'' the Roman Catholic priest said.

<HEAD>Number of Itemizers Down Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The number of taxpayers itemizing deductions is
down 2.5 percent this year, apparently because of the 1986 tax
overhaul, the Internal Revenue Service said Wednesday.
   About 41 percent of the long Form 1040 returns filed through last
weekend had itemized deductions, compared with 49 percent for the
same period last year.
   ``This suggests people may be finding it more advantageous not to
itemize'' because of a higher standard deduction and fewer itemized
deductions permitted under the new tax law, said IRS spokesman Steve
Pyrek.
   Overall, 43.3 million couples and individuals had filed their
returns through last week, 2.2 percent more than the 42.4 million
last year. The IRS has processed 29.3 million, also 2.2 percent more
than the 28.7 million at this time in 1988.
   The long form has accounted for 21.1 million returns this year,
or 49 percent of the total, compared with 21.7 million, or 51
percent a year ago. Filings of the short Form 1040-A are up 7.5
percent, to 10.7 million, and use of the single-page 1040-EZ for
single people is up 6.7 percent, to 11.4 million.
   The number of refunds is down 3 percent, to 18.4 million. The
average refund is up 3 percent, to $827.
   The IRS said 861,916 taxpayers had filed returns electronically
through professional return preparers. That compares with 362,000 in
the same period a year ago.

   India on Wednesday refused to release an
inquiry on the 1984 assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,
prompting an uproar in the lower house of Parliament.
   The government rejected demands by opposition politicians to
release a secret report that allegedly links a powerful government
aide to the slaying.
   Some of the 90 opposition members in the 545-member lower house
chanted ``Dictatorship will not be tolerated!'' and ``We want the
report!''
   In a voice vote, the governing Congress Party suspended at least
63 of the opposition members for the rest of the week for
misbehavior. Most of the other opposition members walked out in
protest.
   All 93 opposition members in the 245-member upper house also
walked out.
   A newspaper said the report indicated the aide changed the time
of the television interview Mrs. Gandhi was heading toward when she
was killed, concealed the fact that he knew one of her assassins,
and let Mrs. Gandhi walk ahead of him just before she was gunned
down.
   Home Minister Buta Singh said a special team had investigated the
suspicions against Mrs. Gandhi's private secretary, Rajendra Kumar
Dhawan, and found that he was ``totally innocent.''
   Dhawan, 52, has refused to comment on the reports.
   Dhawan was dropped from his post after the assassination but was
brought back into the government last month as a key aide to Rajiv
Gandhi, Mrs. Gandhi's son and successor.
   The 1986 inquiry by Supreme Court Justice M.P. Thakkar was
supressed by the government in what it said was the interest of
national security.
   Several newspapers speculated Wednesday that the report may have
been leaked to the Indian Express, the country's largest selling
English-language newspaper, by Cabinet ministers who felt threatened
by Dhawan's return.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed Oct. 31, 1984 in her New Delhi residence
by two of her Sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television
interview.
   One of the Sikhs was shot and killed by other bodyguards minutes
later, and the other was convicted of murder and hanged in January.
A third Sikh, who was convicted of conspiracy, was also hanged.
   The newspaper said he knew Beant Singh, the assassin who was
killed by other bodyguards, but he denied that during questioning.
   The government says Mrs. Gandhi was killed in revenge for an army
raid she ordered in June 1984 on the Golden Temple, the holiest Sikh
shrine.
   At least 1,200 people, many of them Sikhs, were killed in the
raid, which was aimed at flushing out Sikh extremists barricaded
inside the shrine.
   Sikh militants have been fighting since 1982 for an independent
homeland in Punjab, a rich farming state in northern India.
   Sikhs comprise only 2 percent of India's 880 million people but
are in a majority in Punjab. They claim they are discriminated
against by the Hindus, who make up 80 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Propose More Nutrition Information on Food Labels</HEAD>

   Two lawmakers proposed legislation Wednesday to
require food labels to disclose more nutrition information about the
content of cholesterol-raising saturated fats.
   ``The purpose of this legislation is to try to deal with the
problems consumers have when they are faced with a web of confusing
and misleading labels on the foods they are buying,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., who chairs the House Agriculture subcommittee on
wheat, soybeans and feed grains.
   At a news conference, he and Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, complained
that current labeling laws allow foods to make claims of ``no
cholesterol'' or ``100 percent vegetable shortening'' even though
they contain cooking oils with high levels of saturated fat.
   The American Heart Association, which supports the legislation,
says a diet low in saturated fat will help reduce the risk of heart
disease.
   The bill would require food labels to disclose nutrition
information, including saturated fat content by serving, if:
   _Packages display a claim about the product's cholesterol content
or say that it was made with vegetable oil.
   _Packages do not specifically identify which vegetable oil is
contained in the product. Some labels now show only that a product
was made with any of a variety of oils, including highly saturated
tropical oils like palm and coconut oil.

Teen Curfew</HEAD>

   Mayor Marion Barry Jr., trying to curb
drug-related crime, signed legislation Wednesday to strengthen the
city's handgun law, asked police to work six-day weeks, and said he
will allow a curfew to become law in a bid to keep most teen-agers
off the streets late at night.
   He signed an emergency measure mandating a five-year jail term
for anyone convicted of even having access to a gun while committing
a crime in the city, and giving judges the option of denying
pretrial release of defendants caught with weapons.
   ``Tell all the criminals we're coming,'' Barry said at a news
conference. ``If you got your gun, you better get rid of it, because
if you get caught you're going to spend five years in jail.''
   The handgun law, which will be in effect for 90 days before being
reviwed by the city council, strengthens previous law which required
a jail term of five years only if a weapon was used to commit a
crime.
   Barry said the city's 3,920 police will be asked to work six-day
work weeks for the next five weeks, until recruits complete their
training. He said this step would cost the city about $2.6 million
in overtime. He also authorized the police department to hire 150
more people by May 1.
   Barry said he would allow an emergency curfew bill to take
effect, without his signature, on Thursday. It will not be enforced
until Monday to give police time to learn the rules. The curfew bars
anyone under 18 from gathering on streets from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
during the week and from midnight to 6 a.m. on weekends.

Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials of five Central American nations
Wednesday endorsed a plan to send U.N. peacekeepers to the region to
ensure guerrillas don't launch cross-border raids.
   The plan, which needs U.N. approval, calls for up to 100 military
observers to monitor Central American border areas in speedboats,
helicopters and all-terrain vehicles.
   ``We approved the document in the sense that we discussed the
document, and there are no disagreements,'' Nicaragua's deputy
foreign minister, Victor Hugo Tinoco, said after talks with military
officers and foreign ministry officials from El Salvador, Honduras,
Costa Rica and Guatemala.
   The head of the Honduran delegation, Ambassador Roberto Flores
Bermudez, confirmed the agreement in principle had been reached.
   Up to 11,000 Contra rebels have bases in Honduras from which they
launch raids into Nicaragua. They are the prime focus of the
peacekeeping plan.
   In addition, El Salvador says leftist insurgents trying to
overthrow the El Salvadoran government operate from clandestine
bases in Honduras without that government's permission.
   The peacekeepers will also monitor the Costa Rica-Nicaragua
border and will use speedboats to patrol the Gulf of Fonseca, which
links Nicaragua, Honduras and El Salvador on their Pacific coasts,
according to a copy of the U.N. draft plan.
   The U.N. plan says they will need all-terrain vehicles,
helicopters and a light airplane, as well as at least one speedboat.
   The foreign ministers of the five nations will ask the United
Nations to begin setting up the peacekeeping force, a step Tinoco
called ``a formality.''
   In February, the foreign ministers agreed in principle that U.N.
military observers should operate in the region to verify reports of
guerrilla activity and, by their presence, deter such raids.
   The United Nations then drafted a plan calling for up to 100
military observers backed by 60 pilots, drivers and civilian
administrators from Canada, Spain and West Germany.
   A U.N. diplomat said the plan will not conflict with U.S.
intentions to keep the Contras active by providing non-lethal aid.
   The current Congressional six-month appropriation of $27.1
million for the Contras expires at the end of March, and the Bush
administration is hoping to renew it.
   ``It does not pre-empt the humanitarian aid for the Contras; it
does give the United States the breathing space they want'' for the
rebels, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The foreign ministers are to meet March 29-20 in San Jose, Costa
Rica, to take the next step on the peacekeeping plan and discuss
other Central American issues.

   The economy grew at a moderately strong pace
early this year, with widespread evidence of upward pressure on
production costs and prices, the Federal Reserve Board reported
Wednesday.
   ``Consumer spending, except for autos, has apparently gained
momentum while manufacturing, especially for export, continues to
show strength almost everywhere,'' said the report, based on surveys
conducted by the Fed's 12 district banks.
   The study found that with labor markets tight and factories
continuing to operate at high levels even as they expand and
modernize, ``materials and product prices are edging up, albeit
sporadically and at an uneven pace.''
   The survey, known as the Tan Book, was prepared for the March 28
meeting of the Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee, the panel
which sets policy for the central bank.
   The Fed since last March has been nudging interest rates upward
in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus restrain
inflation. Those efforts intensified last month after concern about
inflation heightened with news that consumer prices rose 0.6 percent
in January and wholesale prices surged 1 percent.
   The most recent Fed report, based on survey results received
through March 8, found that ``economic activity for most of the
country is reported to be expanding at a moderately strong pace.''
   The weakest sectors of the economy are energy and, to a lesser
extent, construction, it said.
   The survey found strong gains in consumer spending, with the
exception of autos, for which business has been slow so far this
year. Domestic automakers recently boosted incentive offers in an
effort to stimulate sales, and General Motors Corp. has temporarily
halted production at two plants to reduce inventories.
   Sales of apparel, particularly women's clothing, contributed
significantly to the strength in consumer spending. Some districts
also reported brisk sales of home furnishings and electronics.
   Most of the districts found some tightness in manufacturing labor
markets, with some expectations of increasing upward pressure on
costs and prices ``due either to current strong conditions or
attempts to pass through last year's large increases'' in costs for
raw materials.
   Manufacturers generally are optimistic about production prospects
as exports outpace growth in domestic demand, the report said.
   The banks reported some of the largest and broad-based increases
in capital spending, often viewed as a barometer of business
investment plans, were in the Chicago region. In general, though,
capital spending is not expected to exceed last year's strong pace,
the report said.
   Often, investment spending was aimed at improving efficiency and
modernizing equipment rather than for expanding capacity, the survey
found.
   ``While industries in several districts are said to be operating
close to full capacity, there are few comments about serious
bottlenecks,'' the survey said.

<HEAD>Intellectuals: Release Political Prisoners; Police Stop Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty-three Chinese intellectuals added their
voice Wednesday to the growing demands for democracy in an open
letter calling for the release of political prisoners.
   Police, meanwhile, in an apparent attempt to censure leading
intellectuals, stopped a meeting to discuss a new magazine from
taking place.
   Wednesday's open letter was the fourth sent to China's leaders
since January, and came five days before the opening of an important
political meeting, the National People's Congress.
   Su Wei, a 35-year-old scholar of literature at the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, said he wrote the letter because he
``could not stay silent any longer.''
   ``I have no interest in politics and I am not a hero,'' he said.
``Writing this letter should be a meaningless thing, but the way my
country works, it is a very serious thing.''
   ``As the country prepares to celebrate its 40th anniversary,''
the letter says, ``we urge the National People's Congress ... to
release a large number of detained prisoners.''
   The note also supports a recent call for the release of Wei
Jingsheng, China's most well-known political prisoner. He was
sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for urging democracy.
   The signatories included scholars Liu Mingjiu, an expert on
French philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre, and Chen Jiaying, who
specializes in German thinker Martin Heidegger.
   Participants said the letter was written during a time of growing
political repression.
   They cited the recent police action that kept astrophysicist Fang
Lizhi, China's leading dissident, from attending a banquet President
Bush held on his visit to Beijing earlier this month.
   They said the government had warned them of unspecified
punishment awaiting those who write and sign public letters.
   On Tuesday, China's leading government spokesman, Yuan Mu, said
the state was ``not happy'' with such appeals for political reform,
and accused government critics of ``relying on foreign forces'' to
spread their message.
   Su said he would like his letter to be published in China, ``but
the press here is run by the state.''
   ``The government uses pressure to stop the news and then blames
us for contacting the foreign media,'' said Dai Qing, an author who
signed the letter.
   Amnesty for political prisoners was first proposed by Fang Lizhi
in January in an open letter to Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.
   In February, 33 intellectuals signed a second letter. Hundreds of
people in Hong Kong and Taiwan and Chinese in the United States
signed petitions supporting the call. In March, 42 leading Chinese
scientists joined in.
   Chinese sources said several signatories of the February letter
had been invited to attend a meeting Tuesday to begin the first
issue of Ideologist magazine, but that police stopped the gathering
from taking place.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
meeting of about 50 of China's leading intellectuals initially had
been scheduled for a hotel in downtown Beijing.
   ``When I got there I saw a sign saying the meeting had been
canceled because there was no electricity,'' said one. ``But I went
upstairs and there was lots of electricity, just not in the room we
had reserved.''
   Organizers moved the meeting to a nearby restaurant.
   ``But when we got there, the meeting was canceled again,''
another participant said. ``Police said we needed permission to
meet.''
   The sources said they believed police stopped the gathering to
censure several of the signers of the February letter, most notably
Su Shaozhi and Wang Ruoshui.
   Su, a leading Marxist theoretician, was dismissed from his post
as head of China's Marxism-Leninism Institute because of his
liberalism. Wang was fired as deputy chief editor of the People's
Daily for advocating humanism.
   They sources said Ideologist, a Shanghai-based periodical, a
combination of political essays and literary criticism, probably
would not be affected.

   Student radicals who paralyzed Harvard
University in April 1969 by occupying a campus building and staging
a two-week strike are coming back to commemorate the event and its
impact far beyond Harvard Yard.
   Before comparing graying hair and mellowed politics, they're
planning to kick off the event with a rally, just like the old days.
   ``It's important to reaffirm in some public fashion and some
social context the values and beliefs of 20 years ago,'' said
reunion spokesman Michael Macy, now 40 and a sociology professor at
Brandeis University.
   Invitations to the April 7-8 event are being relayed by word of
mouth among those who forged enduring friendships while attending
Harvard from 1968 to 1971 and participating in the protests.
   In addition to the noon rally, speeches by Harvard alumni and
faculty, guerrilla theater, a teach-in, formal debates and a reunion
party are on the agenda. Buses will be provided for alumni who want
to leave after the reunion party Saturday to attend an equal rights
and pro-choice demonstration in Washington on Sunday.
   The campus upheavals of the 1960s kicked off with the Free Speech
Movement at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964. Across
the country students began marching and protesting against America's
presence in Vietnam and other establishment policies.
   When the ferment hit the country's oldest and most prestigious
university, attention was riveted on the breeding ground for the
nation's elite.
   As Rihard Rowe, then an assistant dean of the Graduate School of
Education, observed at the time: ``The radicals seemed to feel that
Harvard must excel _ in riots as well as in intellect.''
   Shortly after noon on April 9, 1969, some 300 students seized
Harvard's main administration building, threw out nine deans and
chained the doors. They ignored administration orders to leave
University Hall.
   Among other demands, the protesters wanted to get rid of the
campus units of the U.S. military's Reserve Officer Training Corps
units and expand the Afro-American studies program.
   When dawn broke the following day, more than 400 state and local
police charged the building with a battering ram, pulling students
out by the hair, beating them with nightsticks and kicking them.
About 45 people were injured, some after jumping from first-floor
windows. Police carted off 197 people to the Middlesex County Jail.
   One of those arrested was ABC News correspondent Chris Wallace,
then a reporter for the Harvard student radio station.
   ``We were all allowed to make that famous one telephone call,''
Wallace said in an interview Wednesday. ``Some people called their
girlfriends. I called the radio station. At the end of my report, I
signed off: ``This is Chris Wallace, in custody.''
   Wallace said he didn't know about next month's reunion. ``I was
no radical,'' he said, but added that he had protested against the
Vietnam War.
   The show of force by police and the willingness of the university
to deploy them galvanized more morderate students. A three-day
boycott of classes stretched into a 15-day strike in which students
virtually shut down the school.
   Rock music and the chants of protestors throbbed in Harvard Yard
and outside administrative offices. Students hung banners saying
STRIKE from dorm windows and wore T-shirts emblazoned with an
upraised clenched fist. The Harvard student-designed symbol went on
to become an international symbol of protest.
   The few students who didn't boycott classes were taught out of
doors. In a physics class someone wrote on the blackboard: ``No
classes today _ no ruling class tomorrow.'' The instructor told the
five students who showed up that that was the day's lesson.
   By the time the strike officially ended April 25, school
administrators agreed to abolish ROTC on campus, to set up a
department of African and Afro-American Studies and to build
low-cost housing for people displaced by expansion projects.

<TEXT>
   President P.W. Botha returned to
work Wednesday, eight weeks after suffering a stroke, but he didn't
say how he plans to resolve a power struggle with party members who
want a new head of state.
   Botha held a morning Cabinet meeting and was present in
Parliament during the afternoon when Finance Minister Barend du
Plessis announced the 1989-90 budget.
   Neither Botha nor any other members of the governing National
Party commented on the developments Wednesday.
   Botha has yet to make a public statement on a declaration by the
National Party parliamentary caucus, including the full Cabinet,
that it wants the new party leader, Education Minister F.W. de
Klerk, to take over as president.
   Botha and de Klerk sat next to one another during du Plessis'
budget speech Wednesday and exchanged a few words.
   Botha, 73, resigned as party leader Feb. 2 and was succeeded by
de Klerk, 52. Botha said he wanted to distance the presidency from
partisan politics so he could be more of a symbol of national unity,
but the caucus announced Monday that it wanted the party leader to
be head of state.
   The caucus has no formal means of forcing Botha out of the
presidency, barring evidence of misconduct or incapacity which could
prompt impeachment proceedings.
   Botha has the option of remaining in office against the wishes of
his party or deciding on his own to step aside from the government,
which he has led since 1978.
   The power struggle intensified Sunday, when Botha arranged an
interview with the state-controlled television network and said he
would not call an early election this year.
   The next election does not have to be held until March 1990.
Botha's statement, made without consulting party leaders, quashed
hopes that he would retire in the next few months in conjunction
with an early election.
   Some National Party officials have suggested that Botha might
agree to yield policy-making power to de Klerk while remaining in
office until next year. Other political observers have predicted
Botha will aggressively resist any concessions.
   There has been little public support for Botha during the
showdown.
   Botha and De Klerk appear to agree on most major policy issues.
However, de Klerk has been depicted as more pragmatic and
open-minded than Botha and more likely to accelerate the pace of
political change.
   ``A new man ... would be forced to do new things,'' said The
Sowetan, the country's largest black daily newspaper, in an
editorial Tuesday urging Botha to retire.
   Under the country's apartheid system, its 28 million blacks have
no vote in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the
economy and maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

   In 1986 she moved to ABC and won an Emmy award for her writing on
the ``Our World'' historical series.
   In 1987 she left ABC to form her own company, Lucky Duck

   A judge indicted an army major
and a second lieutenant on murder charges Wednesday in the massacre
of 10 peasant farmers.
   The action against military officers by a civilian judge was
unprecedented. Security forces have been blamed for the torture and
death of thousands of civilians during a 9-year-old civil war, but
Maj. Mauricio Beltran and 2nd Lt. Arnaldo Vasquez became the first
officers to be indicted by the civilian authority for killing
Salvadoran citizens.
   Judge Alcides Guandique also indicted seven soldiers for their
alleged role in the slayings six months ago.
   Beltran has denied any role in the killings and contended the
case has been politicized. ``I had nothing against those people. I
did not even know them,'' he has said.
   The indictments followed heavy pressure from the United States,
which provides most of the government's funds and had told officials
that the army could no longer be allowed to kill civilians with
impunity.
   The indictments came in an atmosphere of rising violence only
four days before a presidential election Sunday, during which
Salvadorans for the first time have a chance to dump an incumbent
civilian government.
   Leftist guerrillas have threatened election workers and launched
attacks to prevent people from voting.
   The massacre took place Sept. 21 about 10 miles north of San
Sebastian, in the hamlet of San Francisco. According to the
indictments, troopers of the Jiboa battalion under Beltran's command
rounded up seven men and three woman and killed them with explosives
and gunfire.
   Asked why Beltran might have ordered the captives killed,
Guandique said: ``Psychosis of war.''
   Guandique, 33, conducted a patient investigation that eventually
disproved armed forces' versions of the massacre. He handed down the
indictments in his office in San Sebastian, 30 miles east of San
Salvador.
   The armed forces on Sunday, in another unprecedented step,
admitted responsibility. They had always denied involvement, and
they still deny involvement in a wave of death squad killings in the
early 1980s.
   Leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, who are fighting the U.S.-supported government, have also
murdered civilians. But human rights groups say the rebels have
slain far fewer non-combatants than soldiers or death squads linked
to military units.
   With Guandique's indictment and decree of detention, Beltran and
Vasquez also became the first officers in Salvadoran history to be
jailed on the order of a civilian judge.
   The accused are likely to stand trial before a jury of five in
the coming months, Guandique said. He said charges could be dropped
against some of the defendants if new evidence exonerates them but
that Beltran had been implicated by many witnesses.
   Beltran and Vasquez are being held at military garrisons, said
the judge, but will be moved to a police facility pending trial.
   Lt. Manuel Galvez, second in command on the day of the killings,
broke the case open last week with testimony that Beltran ordered
the 10 people killed.
   Galvez said he refused to carry out the order, and 12 soldiers
backed him up with sworn testimony, said Guandique. Galvez, who had
been held with Beltran and Vasquez by military authorities, was not
indicted and will soon be freed.
   The incident began when about three dozen Jiboa troopers marched
into San Francisco and began rounding up the villagers. The soldiers
reportedly found rebel arms and mines in at least one house.
   The day after the killings, the villagers told The Associated
Press that about 45 of them had been herded into the small
schoolhouse. The troopers, working from a list, separated the 10
victims and marched them away.
   Guandique, citing testimony from Galvez and the soldiers, said
Beltran ordered the captured mines to be placed along a path and
detonated as the detainees were marched past, but the devices did
not explode on the first try.
   Several soldiers surrounded the prisoners and held them in place
while another trooper fetched a new battery to detonate the mines,
Guandique said.
   The mines were finally detonated, killing or wounding all the
prisoners, who were then riddled with rifle fire and dispatched with
a shot to the head, Guandique said.
   Guandique quoted Galvez and others as saying Beltran also ordered
the schoolhouse to be mined and blown up, but he was either
dissuaded or desisted when subordinates balked.
   ``It could have been 50 people instead of 10,'' Guandique said.

<HEAD>Federal Judge Pleads with Senate to Throw Out Impeachment Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge, making a personal plea during
an extraordinary appearance on the Senate floor, urged senators
Wednesday to throw out impeachment charges that he plotted to get a
$150,000 bribe and lied about it at his trial.
   Saying a jury has acquitted him, District Judge Alcee L. Hastings
of Miami told senators: ``The jury system is the cornerstone of
justice in America and to tamper with it lightly is to send a
message that is both pernicious and dangerous.''
   Many senators sat in silence listening to the 52-year-old first
black federal judge in Florida history as he made his appeal.
   The proceeding was held only to hear the plea by Hastings for
dismissal of 16 of the 17 articles of impeachment approved Aug. 3 by
a House vote of 413-3.
   The Senate planned to wait until Thursday to rule on Hastings'
motion to dismiss. Evidence in the case is set to be heard later by
a special Senate committee.
   Hastings called on the senators to dismiss charges that he
conspired with attorney William Borders to obtain a payoff and then
committed perjury at his 1983 trial, which ended in acquittal.
   He was not seeking dismissal of the charge that he disclosed
secret wiretap information and thus torpedoed a federal
investigation. But he did deny that he had done so.
   Standing in the well of the Senate, Hastings recalled in a firm
voice how he had fought the charges against him at his trial.
   ``I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as
I do now,'' Hastings said. He said that when the jury delivered its
verdict after 17 hours of deliberations each of the jurors stood and
said, ``Not guilty.''
   ``Five years of postacquittal investigation has produced no new
evidence that wasn't available to the prosecution,'' Hastings said.
   House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, urged
the Senate to proceed with the impeachment, declaring that Hastings
had ``conspired to sell his public office for personal gain.''
   ``He subverted our judicial process by repeatedly lying under
oath,'' Brooks told the Senate. ``Today, Judge Hastings asks you to
ignore his corrupt conduct. ... In doing so, he asks you to rely on
a tainted jury verdict.''
   Brooks also read a statement from absent Rep. John Conyers,
D-Mich., a leading House proponent of civil rights on the House
Judiciary Committee.
   The Conyers statement said the ``evidence established that Alcee
Hastings ... did in fact commit high crimes and misdemeanors which
justify his impeachment.''
   ``We did not wage the civil rights struggle simply to replace one
form of judicial corruption with another,'' the Conyers statement
said.
   The proceeding is not the same as a criminal trial in a court. If
convicted, Hastings would remain free but would be removed from the
bench and denied his $89,500 annual salary.
   According to the charges, Hastings plotted with Borders in 1981
to obtain a $150,000 bribe from two brothers, Frank and Tom Romano,
convicted of skimming from a Teamsters pension fund loan.
   Prosecutors say that in return, Hastings was planning to wipe out
three-year sentences he had imposed on the brothers. He also
allegedly was prepared to restore more than $1 million forfeited by
the brothers.
   Borders, a prominent Washington criminal lawyer, was convicted in
a separate trial and sentenced to five years in prison. His appeals
failed.
   The Romano brothers, both of whom have since died, never took
part in the alleged bribe conspiracy. They were offered a chance to
do so and made it clear that they were uninterested. Their refusal
complicated matters for the FBI, which already had Borders under
investigation.
   To keep the investigation alive, retired FBI agent H. Paul Rico
posed as Frank Romano and agreed to pay the bribe, prosecutors say.
   Borders was arrested Oct. 9, 1981, as he drove out of a suburban
Virginia parking lot with Rico and with a garment bag packed with
$125,000 in cash.
   FBI agents arrested Hastings in Miami that night.

<HEAD>Ligachev Gets Most Critical Letters, Report Indicates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party received more letters critical
of Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, a conservative counterweight
to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, than any other Soviet leaders,
Tass indicated Wednesday.
   The letters were received in connection with the election
campaigns of Ligachev, Gorbachev and other top party officials for
posts in the nation's new parliament, the official news agency said.
   Valentin Koptyug, chairman of the party's Electoral Commission,
made the letters public as the party's policy-making Central
Committee met to discuss agricultural policy and choose its
representatives to the parliament.
   The Communist Party is one of 30 organizations with the power to
choose one-third of the 2,250 representatives in the new Congress of
People's Deputies. The 100 deputies elected by the party in a secret
ballot include most members of the 12-man ruling Politburo, 26
workers and seven collective farmers, Tass reported.
   It said 25 letters sent to the Electoral Commission ``voiced
disagreement with some ideas voiced by Central Committee Secretary
and Politburo member Yegor Ligachev at the 19th National Party
Conference last summer.''
   Tass did not provide details of the letters.
   At a July 1 session of the conference, Ligachev said that with
all the criticism of events in the Soviet past, achievements had
been ignored and ``truth is often completely distorted.''
   Ligachev, 68, held the important post of ideology secretary,
making him No. 2 in the leadership structure after Gorbachev, until
Sept. 30, when he was shifted to a job with apparently less clout:
head of a new party commission on agriculture.
   Three letters criticized Gorbachev, Tass quoted Koptyug as saying.
   ``The party leader was blamed for the current situation in the
country because he was a member of the party leadership in the years
preceding the perestroika, or restructuring drive,'' Tass said.
   Gorbachev, 58, was named to the Politburo in 1979, during the
rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev _ an era now condemned as a ``period of
stagnation.''
   Tass said that of the other letters criticizing Politburo
members, nine were about Moscow party chief Lev Zaikov and two were
about Gorbachev ally Alexander Yakovlev.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Houston Longshoremen Back To Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Longshoremen returned to work without incident
Wednesday after a federal judge intervened in a wildcat strike that
temporarily shut down the Port of Houston, officials said.
   The port was paralyzed for several hours Tuesday afternoon after
a mob of men armed with knives and razors stormed a terminal,
slashing more than 1,000 100-pound sacks of rice and reportedly
threatening non-union dockworkers.
   No one was injured.
   An undetermined number of International Longshoremen's
Association members from the union's Local 24 left their jobs at the
Turning Basin docks after the episode to protest a company's use of
non-ILA labor to load the rice, authorities said.
   Port of Houston spokesman Lee Vela said the longshoremen idled
five ships on the docks, five miles east of downtown.
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner ordered the workers back on the
job late Tuesday. The West Gulf Maritime Association, a waterfront
employers' trade group, said the walkout violated its contract with
the ILA.
   Lawyers for the ILA's South Atlantic and Gulf Coast District and
for ILA Local 24, some of whose members engaged in the wildcat
strike, had no objection to the back-to-work order. They said the
ILA leadership had no role in instigating the strike.
   ``We have a contract to the stevedores. We're going to fulfill
it. We're going to work because these people are our bread and
butter,'' said Local 24 Vice President Jerry Hibbeler.
   ILA longshoremen make $12 to $18 an hour, depending on the kind
of cargo they are working, and their employers pay up to $7 into a
benefit fund for each hour they work. Non-union workers from $6 to
$8 an hour, often without benefits.
   Houston police Sgt. J.A. Pavalock said Wednesday that no further
incidents were reported.

<HEAD>Bush Not Moving Against U.S.-Made Assault Weapons</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration has no plans to curtail
sales of semiautomatic assault guns that are produced in the United
States even while suspending imports of similar weapons, the White
House said Wednesday.
   Furthermore, President Bush, despite the move against imports
announced Tuesday, still does not support a ban on the weapons
themselves, his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
   Fitzwater was asked by reporters if the president would expand
the review of the uses of the weapons to domestic models.
   ``There are no plans of that kind anticipated,'' he said.
   ``Right now we don't see any need for any review or any other
changes at all.'' He said the problem of imports was highlighted in
discussions between Bush's new drug policy coordinator, William
Bennett, and Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``It did prompt a review of them. ... At this point we are not
willing to extend that,'' Fitzwater said.
   Several domestic models perform the same functions and have the
same characteristics as the imported models affected by Tuesday's
suspension. One U.S. manufacturer, Colt, on Wednesday announced a
voluntary suspension of sales of its AR15, a civilian version of the
military's .223-caliber M-16.
   The weapons have prompted growing public concern, especially with
regard to their proliferation and use in drug-related street
violence.
   The California State Legislature has acted to ban a wide range of
semiautomatic weapons in the wake of a schoolyard shooting spree in
January in which Patrick Edward Purdy killed five Stockton children
with a Chinese-made AK-47. He then killed himself.
   The administration's suspension of imports, pending a review of
their uses in the United States, will affect some 110,000 weapons,
Bennett said, including AKS-type firearms such as AK-47s, Uzi
carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons and Steyr Aug semiautomatic
weapons.
   Fitzwater stopped short of completely ruling out action on the
domestically produced weapons.
   ``We're not going through and changing everything that's not
warranted. We're just saying here's an issue that's come to light.
We need to deal with this and then we'll see where we go,'' he said.
   While the move against imports is seen as a softening of Bush's
longstanding opposition to gun controls, and a potential sore spot
with his fellow National Rifle Association members, Fitzwater
contended Bush was not making a new policy.
   The administration suspended the imports using existing law that
allows import of the semiautomatics only if they are for sporting
use.
   The next step is to find out if they are being used in other ways.
   Fitzwater sidestepped numerous questions about why the use of
imports needs to be reviewed when domestic weapons are not reviewed.
   While saying there has been no change in Bush's position,
Fitzwater also expanded the president's position beyond what Bush
told reporters when the question first arose last month.
   Bush had said at that time he would ``strongly oppose'' a ban on
semiautomatics. In subsequent remarks he said he was concerned about
the problem and had asked Bennett to come up with suggestions to
deal with it and still ``do what's right'' by the sportsman.
   Fitzwater said Wednesday that the president's original position
was that ``he does not favor banning the wepaons that are used by
sportsmen and are in compliance with the law.''
   ``He has said initially that he did not belive in banning these
guns until we looked into it. He was concerned about the problem.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle told The Associated Press he received
several ``inquiries'' from people concerned about the administration
action.
   He declined to elaborate, but said Bush ``was absolutely right to
enforce the existing regulations we have. ... I see it as a serious
attempt by President Bush to review the situation.''

<HEAD>New Veterans Cabinet Agency Starts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY B. DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a flag-decked ceremony on the White House
South Lawn, President Bush on Wednesday marked the evolution of the
old Veterans Administration into the new Department of Veterans
Affairs after swearing in a former Army private to lead it.
   ``I consider the new department to have a vital mission. It is so
vital there is only one place for the veterans of America: In the
cabinet room with the President of the United States,'' Bush told
several hundred guests with the new secretary, Edward J. Derwinski,
by his side.
   On the podium with Derwinski was a former constituent he called
``the friend of the GI,'' Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Bill
Mauldin of the Chicago Sun-Times, creator of the bedraggled Willie
and Joe characters of World War II.
   Derwinski, a 12-term Illinois congressman who filled high State
Department posts in the Reagan administration, was sworn in by the
president in a private ceremony in the Roosevelt Room. His wife,
Bonnie, and children Michael and Maureen accompanied him.
   The new secretary said Americans thought of veterans in terms
immortalized by Rudyard Kipling's tribute to the British ``Tommy:''
   ``For it's Tommy this, an' Tommy that, an' ``Chuck 'im out, the
brute!'
   ``But it's `Saviour of 'is country' when the guns begin to
shoot.''
   In praising Derwinski as ``uniquely suited'' to lead the new
department, Bush said, ``He has the skill of a seasoned legislator,
the patience of a practical administrator, the finesse of a diplomat
and the heart of a man who knows what it means to start his
government career as a private in the United States Army.''
   The 62-year-old Derwinski served in the occupation of Japan in
1945-1946.
   Bush said that if he does his job well as president, ``our armed
forces will be so strong and our diplomacy so wise that we will
never again need to erect another monument to the casualties of
war,'' and the resulting peace ``will be the truest monument to our
veterans.''
   The audience, many in the colored garrison caps of veterans
organizations, pledged allegiance to the flag at the beginning of
the ceremony, the first time it was remembered being done in the
Bush White House. Bush was a vigorous defender of the pledge during
the fall campaign, often attacking Michael Dukakis' veto as
Massachusetts governor of a bill requiring public school teachers to
lead the pledge each day.
   For years, the veterans organizations sought the status and clout
they thought Cabinet status would bring, but the general reluctance
of Congress and administrations to multiply Cabinet departments
prevented the change until President Reagan's election-year
conversion last year. A study by the National Academy of Public
Administration said greater influence was by no means certain.
   It is the second-largest government agency, with more than
240,000 employees. Formed in 1930 out of programs administered by
several departments, it expects to keep using its old short name
``VA.''
   Derwinski has been warning his constituencies and congressional
committees for weeks that when budget deficits have to come down,
his budgetary influence is uncertain. He repeated that warning
Wednesday: ``This isn't the world's best time in Washington for
matters involving the budget.''
   His department spends $29.8 billion a year and has budgeted $10.8
billion for the nation's largest medical care system, the 172
hospitals and hundreds of clinics, nursing homes and other
facilities operated by the VA.
   Officials have said their medical system will be $600 million
short this year, forcing delays in care for veterans with problems
not arising from their service.
   Derwinski has won approval in principle to submit a request for a
supplemental appropriation for $300 million, but warned in an
interview earlier this week ``We don't have the official Office of
Management and Budget blessing.''
   There was no sign of such a blessing in Wednesday's speeches.
   But Derwinski's willingness to fight for it has impressed the
veterans groups as exactly what they wanted. Jim Hanson, spokesman
for the American Legion, said: ``One thing that impressed most of us
was that before he was confirmed, even, he went over and asked for
more money. I don't know that anybody's ever done that before.''
   One of the audience, Charles Hohenstein of Veterans of Foreign
Wars Post 9619 in Morningside, Md., said, ``It's a little too early
to say'' whether the new department will carry more weight but ``I
hope it does.''
   The department's pension and benefit programs spend more than $17
billion a year and include the nation's fifth largest life insurance
system and loan guarantees for 12 million homeowners. In all, a
third of the population is a potential client of the agency, either
as one of 27 million veterans or as a dependent of one.

<HEAD>Organ Donation On Rise, Network Says</HEAD>

   Americans are donating livers, hearts and other
organs with growing frequency, national transplant network officials
said Wednesday after analyzing data covering 15 months.
   ``Organ donation is really steadily increasing,'' said Dr.
William K. Vaughn, director of technical services for the United
Network for Organ Sharing in Richmond, Va.
   Despite the gains, particularly in liver donations, such organs
are still in critically short supply because as transplant
techniques advance more patients are added to waiting lists for
organs.
   A record 16,792 people were awaiting transplants in the United
States as of Monday, the vast majority of them in need of kidneys,
said network spokeswoman Kelle Straw.
   In 1987, the latest year for which figures are available, 8,967
kidneys were transplanted nationwide along with 1,438 hearts, 1,199
livers, 142 pancreata and 41 heart-lung combinations, Ms. Straw
said. The number of kidney, pancreas and heart-lung transplants was
down slightly from the previous year, while the number of heart and
liver transplants was up.
   ``People may look at these figures and say, `Well fine, within a
couple of years, you should wipe everybody out waiting.' They don't
realize it's an evolving list,'' she said.
   The findings contradict earlier reports that donations were down
during the first half of 1988. Vaughn said those reports were valid
at the time because organ donation is cyclical.
   ``In the winter months, donation is down and it picks up in the
spring,'' he said. ``It's really high in the summer,'' the most
common time for accidents that leave victims brain-dead and their
other organs intact.
   The largest gain during the 15-month period was in liver
donation, Vaughn said. He estimated 160 livers were donated in
December 1988, the last month studied, up from 118 in October 1987,
the first month studied.
   Heart donations climbed from an estimated 170 to 200 a month
during the same period. Kidney donations jumped from an estimated
595 to 660 a month, while pancreas donations rose from an estimated
36 to more than 50 a month.
   The estimates are based on an analysis of seasonal and other
trends in data collected by the network from the nation's 72 organ
procurement agencies, Vaughn said. Only donated livers, hearts,
kidneys and pancreata were charted.
   The United Network for Organ Sharing, known as UNOS, began
compiling the information in October 1987, when federal guidelines
took effect for doling out scarce organs.
   At the same time, transplant centers and organ procurement
agencies began participating in the National Organ Transplantation
Network and the National Organ Transplantation Scientific Registry,
both computerized services administered by UNOS under contracts with
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``We can't compare prior to that time. No one has any data,''
Vaughn said.
   The figures do not represent the number of transplant operations
because some donated organs were discarded as unsuitable, Vaughn
said.
   Network officials did not attempt to characterize the donors or
learn what prompted the families' charity.

<HEAD>Main Afrikaner Church Declines To Actively Oppose Apartheid</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The main church of the ruling
Afrikaners on Wednesday said it would not support resistance to
apartheid, a decision almost certain to widen a split with its black
and mixed-race sister churches.
   The white branch of the Dutch Reformed Church also placed
qualifications on a statement it made last week declaring apartheid
a sin and heresy.
   The black and mixed-race churches last week prepared documents
calling for civil disobedience and outspoken opposition to apartheid
and presented them to the white church.
   The white church's General Synodical Commission, a high-level
policy-making body, on Wednesday named a committee to study the
apartheid issue further before taking a position, said Pierre
Rossouw, the church's chief executive.
   ``These are important and sensitive matters and we want to
consider them carefully,'' Rossouw said.
   With about 1 million adult members, the white Dutch Reformed
Church is the largest and most influential denomination among South
Africa's 3 million Afrikaners. President P.W. Botha and most members
of his Cabinet and Parliament are among its congregants.
   The black Dutch Reformed Church has 1.1 million members and the
mixed-race branch 680,000 congregants.
   The church's reluctance to become directly involved in opposing
apartheid is virtually certain to damage its already fragile
relations with black and mixed-race branches.
   ``The position of the white Dutch Reformed Church is very sad,''
said Rev. Nico Smith, one of the few white ministers who belong to
the black church. ``The white church is rapidly becoming irrelevant
to what's happening in South Africa.''
   The black and mixed-race churches include some of the country's
best known anti-apartheid campaigners, such as Rev. Allan Boesak and
Rev. Beyers Naude.
   Leaders of all three churches met last week, and the white church
declared for the first time that apartheid was a sin and asked
forgiveness for its longtime support of racial segregation.
   ``We confess with humility and sorrow the participation of our
church in the introduction and legitimation of the ideology of
apartheid and the subsequent suffering of people,'' the delegation
from the white church said.
   But the synod on Wednesday gave only a tepid endorsement of that
statement, noting it did not carry the weight of an official church
treaty and should be understood in terms of previous church policy.
   The synod specifically referred to a 1986 document that said
apartheid was a mistake, but stopped short of calling it a sin or a
heresy.
   Boesak said the white church commission must at least call for
the lifting of the country's 33-month-old state of emergency and the
release of all detainees held without charge.
   ``If they can't do these things, they will seriously jeopardize
our relationship, and their integrity will be seriously in
question,'' Boesak said Monday.
   The Dutch Reformed Church provided the scriptural justification
for apartheid when the governing National Party came to power in
1948 and began codifying racial segregation.
   Under apartheid, South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in
national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and
maintain separate districts, schools and health services.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of Hungarians took to
the streets Wednesday to celebrate new freedoms in one of the
biggest displays of nationalist sentiment since the anti-Soviet
revolt of 1956.
   Masses of people dressed in the national colors of red, white and
green and pre-communist coats of arms swarmed for hours through
central Budapest.
   It was the first time in 41 years communist officials made a
public legal holiday of the March 15 anniversary of Hungary's
unsuccessful revolt against Austria in 1848.
   Police did not interfere with the events, which included an
unofficial rally organized by 31 independent groups.
   An estimated 50,000 people jammed the square in front of
Hungarian state television offices for that rally. A 12-point
declaration calling for more freedom and independence was read, and
the throng moved to parliament chanting: ``Democracy! Democracy!''
   ``Not only should March 15 be a day of freedom, but the 16th,
17th, 18th and all the other days of the year!'' shouted independent
activist Denes Csegeny outside the television building.
   The 12-point declaration included demands for free elections, a
multiparty system, freedom of speech and press, the withdrawal of
Soviet troops and a neutral and independent Hungary.
   A call for a public holiday on Oct. 23, the anniversary of the
start of the 1956 revolt crushed by the Red Army, was greeted with
especially loud applause.
   ``March 15 and Oct. 23 are the holy days of the Hungarian
people,'' Imre Necs, who participated in the revolt, told the crowd.
   Jubilant crowds roved through the city singing national songs.
They also recognized the efforts of other East block nations to gain
more freedoms.
   One huge banner reading ``56, 68, 81'' and the national flags of
Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland recalled the violent suppression
of reforms in the countries in those years.
   At an official rally attended by 60,000, leading Communist Party
reformer Rezsoe Nyers criticized what he said were attempts by late
Soviet President Leonid I. Brezhnev to choke reform in Eastern
Europe after 1968.
   The Soviets led a Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia that
year to crush communist-led reforms. Similar reforms then were
stifled in Hungary.
   The Hungarian government has increasingly accepted independent
political groups in recent months, and leaders of the Smallholders'
Party and the Social Democrats shared the rostrum with Nyers.
   He drew applause when he charged that the Kremlin largely decided
Hungarian policy from 1948 to 1956.
   Dissident groups have staged unofficial anti-communist rallies on
March 15 since the early 1970s. But in 1986, riot police brutally
dispersed crowds that gathered for that year's events.
   Independent groups that staged Wednesday's unofficial rally in
Budapest refused to celebrate with the cCommunists, arguing that
party members were responsible for past suppression of independent
rallies.
   But Csengey said the separate celebrations did not mean the
independent groups would not work with the communists for reforms.
   Communist Party reformer Imre Pozsgay made similar comments in a
speech at a joint celebration of party and independent groups in
Gyoer in western Hungary.

   Congressional negotiators warned Wednesday that
their budget talks with the White House won't be resolved quickly.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley said the discussions could
cause Congress to miss its April 15 deadline for approving a fiscal
1990 budget resolution.
   ``I do not expect this to move very fast,'' Foley, D-Wash., who
was attending the talks that resumed on Capitol Hill. ``It has to
move over a period of time. It's a gradual process.''
   ``What we would like to do is meet the April 15 date for a budget
resolution,'' he said. But ``that often has not been possible'' and
a May 15 completion of a fiscal 1990 budget might be more realistic,
he said.
   An agreement by March 23, when the negotiating group is scheduled
to report back to President Bush and the House and Senate
leadership, would be ``very early,'' he said.
   Foley attended the closed-door talks with White House budget
director Richard Darman, the chairmen of the House and Senate budget
committees, and the senior Republicans from those panels.
   On Thursday, top lawmakers from the House and Senate committees
in charge of taxes and entitlements will join the talks.
   ``Simply because we meet with the tax-writing committees does not
in and of itself indicate we are discussing extensive taxes,'' said
Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., the Senate budget chairman.
   The negotiators were trying to learn ``what's realistic by way of
spending restraints or what might be realistic by way of revenue
enhancements, and then go on to judgement further on down the
line,'' he said.
   ``It's not something that's gonig to be resolved in a matter of
two or three days,'' he said.
   ``We haven't really begun what I would call serious
negotiating,'' said Darman, who said the group was making ``no
decisions on anything.''
   ``I would be very surprised if decisions are made as we go along.
I think that the way these things work or don't work is you agree at
the end on a package and it's unlikely that you get specific
decisions made (separately) along the way.''
   Wednesday's session included a review of the spending initiatives
Bush included in the $1.16 trillion spending plan for fiscal 1990,
which he proposed Feb. 9.
   However, at a White House meeting Tuesday with Bush and
congressional leaders, it was agreed the talks will not aim for
agreement on any specific policies. Instead, they agreed the talks
will aim for an overall balance between entitlements, other domestic
programs, military spending and foreign aid, and the amount of new
government revenue that will be raised.
   The talks will also focus first on only fiscal 1990, although
lawmakers and the administration have said it would be desirable to
achieve a two-year pact.
   For fiscal 1990, the Gramm-Rudman law calls for reducing the
deficit to $100 billion. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that
goal can be met without a tax increase, but many Democrats contend
the fiscal 1991 target of $64 billion can't reached without new
taxes.
   ``I myself think it is going to be much easier to reach agreement
on fiscal year 1990 than it is on fiscal year 1991,'' Sasser said
Wednesday, without ruling it out.
   The negotiators Wednesday laid out a schedule for discussing
taxes and entitlements on Thursday, discretionary spending on
Friday, and defense spending next Monday.

<HEAD>U.N. Aide Optimistic on New Refugee Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior U.N. official said Wednesday he is
optimistic a plan to stem the exodus of refugees from Vietnam will
win approval at a special U.N.-sponsored conference in June.
   Sergio Vieira de Mello, director for Asia in the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, made the comment while
outlining the plan endorsed at a meeting last week in Malaysia.
   One aim of the proposal is to deter Vietnamese boat people by
``making them think twice about risking their lives'', he said,
referring to reports of piracy on the high seas.
   Last year, more than 45,000 boat people landed in Southeast Asian
countries, compared with fewer than 30,000 in 1987.
   Under the plan, emigres from Vietnam will no longer be
automatically granted refugee status. As of March 14, only those who
flee persecution are eligible for asylum and permanent resettlement.
   Others who leave the country for economic reasons will be
encouraged to return, said de Mello. At the same time, he said,
efforts will be made to ``increase awareness'' among potential
emigrants in Vietnam of the dangers they risk leaving the country
illegally.
   ``Along certain coasts, the push-off policy or, in more
diplomatic terms, the redirection of boats to other countries is
practically systematic,'' he noted.
   In addition there is to be a campaign to stress the advantages of
the 10-year-old ``Orderly Departure Program,'' under which 23,000
people were flown out of of Vietnam last year, most of them for
resettlement in the United States and Australia.
   De Mello said that figure is expected to double this year.
   Negotiations are also under way to include in the program former
detainees of Vietnamese ``reeducation camps.'' De Mello said that by
U.N. standards, these people would have a ``legitimate claim to the
status of refugees.''
   The plan was endorsed last week by representatives from Southeast
Asian countries, China and the Soviet Union. An international
conference to approve it is tentatively scheduled June 13 and 14 in
Geneva.
   China granted asylum to about 280,000 ethnic Chinese who fled
northern Vietnam in the late 1970s, when relations between the two
Communist neighbors deteriorated. Many have been resettled on state
farms in southern China but have complained of hardship and
discrimination.
   In Hong Kong on Wednesday, about 150 Vietnamese refugees who fled
to the British colony after being resettled in China staged a
demonstration to protest plans to send them back to China, a
government spokesman said.
   The Vietnamese at the Green Island center climbed onto a
dormitory roof and shouted slogans protesting repatriation, said
Gordon Tam, a spokesman for the Correctional Services Department.
   One Vietnamese woman fell from the roof and was hospitalized,
according to Tam, who said he had no information on her condition.

   A 48-hour nationwide strike sputtered to
a close Wednesday as millions of workers ignored the call by two
leftist labor federations to stop work in Latin America's largest
country.
   Although the strike tied up public transportation in many cities,
nearly all banks, shops, supermarkets, gas stations and department
stores were open for business.
   Scattered violence was reported in the protest of a
government-imposed wage freeze.
   In Sao Paulo, South America's biggest city, the subway and
commuter train service operated normally. About 1,500 of the city's
4,000 privately owned buses were on the streets Wednesday, compared
to only 800 on the first day of the strike. But the 3,500 buses
owned and operated by the city remained idle.
   Police in Sao Paulo said 30 buses were damaged by rock-throwing
demonstrators and 23 people were arrested on Wednesday.
   In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second-largest city, about 300 of the
city's 4,000 privately owned buses ventured out, despite incidents
of rock-throwing by strike supporters.
   However, Rio's subway, commuter ferry and government-run commuter
trains, which carry about 1 million passengers a day, were idle for
a second day.
   The Jornal do Brasil radio station reported three bus passengers
shot and injured two pickets who tried to stop the bus on Rio's poor
north side.
   Workers stuck without regular transportation formed carpools,
hitchhiked, rode bicycles or walked to get to their jobs.
   ``The strike is clearly petering out, and everything indicates a
majority of the state's factory workers are at their jobs,'' said
Luis Carlos Grenadero, a spokesman for Sao Paulo state's Federation
of Industries.
   Granadero said more employees went to work Wednesday than on the
previous day, when the federation said more than 70 percent of the 2
million factory workers in the state showed up at their jobs.
   The national strike command estimated that 70 percent of the
country's 60 million workers were on strike. It acknowledged,
however, that the stoppage had lost much of its momentum in Sao
Paulo.
   In the capital of Brasilia, banks reopened Wednesday after
shutting down the previous day.
   In Vitoria, capital of southeastern Espirito Santo state, police
used rubber truncheons to disperse a group of strikers blocking a
highway. TV footage showed images of police beating and dragging
away a city councilwoman.
   President Jose Sarney's office declined to comment on the strike.
On Tuesday, spokesman Carlos Henrique de Almeida Santos acknowledged
``isolated work stoppages'' in many cities.
   Organizers had pledged to stop all economic activity in major
cities.
   The strike was organized by Brazil's two largest labor movements,
the radical left Central Workers Union and the more moderate General
Workers Central, which claim to represent 35 million workers in
3,000 unions.
   The strike was called to protest a 2-month-old wage freeze, which
formed part of the government's latest economic package aimed at
controlling 1,000 percent inflation.
   Inflation dropped from 28.7 percent in Decemeber to 3.6 percent
for the first 11 days of February, the latest period for which the
government has figures.
   But the economic package slashed workers' purchasing power by up
to 49 percent, claimed Jair Meneguelli, president of the Central
Workers Union.
   More than half of Brazilian workers earn less than $50 a week.

<HEAD>Iran Calls On Moslem Nations To Stand United Against Rushdie</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with speech by Iranian official,

<TEXT>
   Iran called on Moslem officials
attending a conference here Wednesday to support Iran's decision to
break relations with Britain and call for the execution of author
Salman Rushdie.
   But the Saudi Arabian foreign minister, who is chairman of the
46-member Organization of Islamic Conference, said he believed the
organization would only denounce Rushdie and his book, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   ``Iran was honored to have broken ties with the leader of the
plot,'' Mohammad Taskhiri, head of Iran's delegation, said referring
to Britain in a speech at the foreign ministers' conference.
   Taskhiri urged all Islamic governments to stand united against
what he described as ``these mean attempts to offend the image of
the Prophet Mohammed, his wives and daughters.''
   ``If we are silent now, the West will make a film and then a
video'' of ``The Satanic Verses,'' he said.
   ``We demand that the punishment decreed by Allah be meted out on
that apostate (Rushdie). We also demand that all Islamic countries
boycott Britain culturally and, if that doesn't work, then
politically and economically.''
   The punishment Taskhiri referred to was a fatwa, or religious
ruling, issued by the Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
ordering Rushdie's execution for blasphemy.
   Iranian clerics later offered up to $5.2 million to anyone who
killed the 41-year-old author, who was born into a Moslem family in
India, but who later moved to Britain, where he has been under
police guard since the death threat.
   The Saudi Arabian foreign minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, told
reporters:
   ``The conference examined the insufferable affronts and
distortions of Islam in Rushdie's book, which has been strongly
condemned and denounced.''
   He indicated the conference could not condone Iran's order to
kill Rushdie and punish Britain for protecting him.
   He said the conference attaches great importance to the ``spirit
of harmony between all world civilizations and countries.''
   In Rushdie's novel, the archangel Gabriel is depicted as an
Indian movie star. A scribe claims he altered the words of the holy
Koran _ considered the word of God _ without the prophet noticing.
And a whorehouse triples its business when its 12 women take on the
identities of the prophets' wives.
   At least 19 people have been killed in anti-Rushdie protests in
Pakistan and India, and the book has been banned in those countries
and others, including Egypt, South Africa and Bangladesh.
   In Peshawar, Pakistan, on Wednesday, a bomb exploded and tore a
two-foot hole in the roof of a British Council library. A library
official linked the blast, in which no one was hurt, to Moslem
outrage over Rushdie's novel.
   Sudan announced Wednesday it was banning all books written by
Rushdie or issued by his publisher, Viking Penguin.
   In an interview earlier Wednesday, Taskhiri insisted that Rushdie
be judged according to the sharia, or Koranic law _ which he said
requires the death sentence for blasphemy. ``That would be the end
of our request,'' Taskhiri said. ``It is impossible for Iran to
change its basic position on the issue.''
   Conference sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said most
delegates follow another interpretation of the sharia, insisting
that anyone accused of blasphemy be given a fair trial and an
oppportunity to repent.
   Islamic theologians meeting in Mecca, Saudi Arabia, the holiest
shrine of Islam, issued a declaration Tuesday supporting that
interpretation.
   Several delegates were trying to work out a compromise between
Iran and the more liberal group led by Saudi Arabia, the sources
said.

<TEXT>
   City Hall memos will be going down the toilet,
literally, in a new recycling program.
   ``You'll all be amused to learn that the memos you get from your
bosses are probably going to end up as toilet paper,'' Kirsten
Svare, spokeswoman for the Department of Streets and Sanitation,
said at training sessions for City Hall employees.
   At the sessions, which ended Wednesday, employees were shown
slides of the paper's uses, including paper towels and toilet paper,
Ms. Svare said.
   ``Everybody laughed,'' she said. ``It's a great laugh.''
   The city will collect the millions of miles of paper produced in
City Hall and sell it to Recycling Services Inc., officials said.
   The company will then sell the recycled raw material to paper
mills across the country to turn it into useable paper products,
officials said.
   ``Most of it is going to be turned into toilet paper,'' Ms. Svare
said in a telephone interview. ``We don't know where the toilet
paper is going to end up. It could end up in your bathroom.''
   At an average cost of $40 per ton for pick-up of office trash,
the City Hall program is expected to save $600 to $1,200 a month,
based upon the expected 15 to 30 tons a month of paper to be
recycled, according to a news release.
   Leroy Bannister, administrative assistant to Mayor Eugene Sawyer,
said the program is serious business.
   ``It is part of the city's overall waste disposal program,'' he
said, adding that last year the city spent $10 million for waste
disposal.

   The storm of protest and debate sparked by an
American flag displayed on the floor at a student art exhibit has
become part of the work, as spectators record their opinions in
ledgers inviting comment.
   The exhibit at the School of the Art Institute closes Thursday,
but the disputed piece, ``What is the Proper Way to Display the U.S.
Flag,'' remained a work in progress Wednesday as visitors scribbled
words of anger or encouragement in the blank books.
   In its four weeks on display, the work by ``Dread'' Scott Tyler,
24, has triggered veterans' protests, debate on Capitol Hill,
censure by the state House and a lawsuit dismissed by a Circuit
judge who upheld the school's right to display it.
   Some samples among the hundreds of opinions, most unsigned, that
have been logged in the three ledgers that sit on a wall shelf above
the flag:
   ``You should be put on the floor and walked on.'
   ``Good work at provoking a reaction. That's what art is supposed
to do.''
   ``Don't tread on me.''
   ``This took guts. If you believe in what you did, good for you.''
   ``You skunk _ my father's flag was drapped (sic) over his coffin
...''
   ``It's only a piece of cloth. The idea behind it is good or bad.
I think this is a lot of fuss over nothing.''
   ``Other countries will see us defacing our flag. They will think
we are weak.''
   ``But you got people to think and that's what art is for.''
   ``Watch your back.''
   One visitor congratulated Tyler on enlisting viewers to help
complete the piece with their comments _ ``living history.''
   Another complained about the ``myopia'' of visitors who focus on
Tyler's work and ignore all the other art in the exhibit, which
featured 66 minority-student works, mostly paintings.
   Visitors Wednesday were admitted in small groups for security
reasons and allowed only about 10 minutes at the school's public
gallery, which prompted some grumbling. Many returned to the end of
the short line for another look.
   A few protesters turned out and proudly held American flags high
in front of the Art Institute as security guards sighed with relief
at the prospect of the exhibit's closing Thursday afternoon. Earlier
demonstrations drew more than 2,000 people.
   School spokeswoman Beth Sullivan said the flag is placed on the
floor every morning beneath a black-and-white photomontage and the
shelf containing the ledgers.
   During Wednesday's visit the flag sat neatly folded on the shelf.
   School officials said protesters opposed to the display often
take the flag off the floor soon after the exhibit opens in the
morning and it remains on the shelf until a spectator puts it back
on the floor, and that this is all a part of the work.
   ``It's an appropriate response to pick it up and fold it and for
others to take it down again,'' said Peter Brown, the school's vice
president.
   Veterans and others opposed to the display contend the flag's
placement on the floor invites visitors to walk on it _ a claim
disputed by school officials.
   Robert Mars, the Art Institute's vice president for
administration, successfully pleaded the museum's case before the
Chicago Park District Board's finance committee, which decided
Tuesday not to cut off funds for all eight museums in the city
because of the exhibit.
   ``The bad news is that the flag doesn't mean to the Scott Tylers
of this country what it means to so many of us,'' Mars told the
committee. ``The good news is that our system worked. The student
was allowed to make his statement.''
   Tyler has called his work revolutionary and says he had no
apologies, despite death threats he said he and his mother have
received.

   The Bush administration has no plans to curtail
sales of semiautomatic assault guns that are produced in the United
States even while suspending imports of similar weapons, the White
House said Wednesday.
   Furthermore, President Bush, despite the move against imports
announced Tuesday, still does not support a ban on the weapons
themselves, his press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said.
   Fitzwater was asked by reporters if the president would expand
the review of the uses of the weapons to domestic models.
   ``There are no plans of that kind anticipated,'' he said.
   ``Right now we don't see any need for any review or any other
changes at all.'' He said the problem of imports was highlighted in
discussions between Bush's new drug policy coordinator, William
Bennett, and Stephen Higgins, director of the Bureau of Alcohol
Tobacco and Firearms.
   ``It did prompt a review of them. ... At this point we are not
willing to extend that,'' Fitzwater said.
   Several domestic models perform the same functions and have the
same characteristics as the imported models affected by Tuesday's
suspension. One U.S. manufacturer, Colt Industries, on Wednesday
announced a voluntary suspension of sales of its AR15, a civilian
version of the military's .223-caliber M-16.
   The weapons have prompted growing public concern, especially with
regard to their proliferation and use in drug-related street
violence.
   The California State Legislature has acted to ban a wide range of
semiautomatic weapons in the wake of a schoolyard shooting spree in
January in which Patrick Edward Purdy killed five Stockton children
with a Chinese-made AK-47. He then killed himself.
   The administration's suspension of imports, pending a review of
their uses in the United States, will affect some 110,000 weapons,
Bennett said, including AKS-type firearms such as AK-47s, Uzi
carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons and Steyr Aug semiautomatic
weapons.
   Fitzwater stopped short of completely ruling out action on the
domestically produced weapons.
   ``We're not going through and changing everything that's not
warranted. We're just saying here's an issue that's come to light.
We need to deal with this and then we'll see where we go,'' he said.
   While the move against imports is seen as a softening of Bush's
longstanding opposition to gun controls, and a potential sore spot
with his fellow National Rifle Association members, Fitzwater
contended Bush was not making a new policy.
   The administration suspended the imports using existing law that
allows import of the semiautomatics only if they are for sporting
use.
   The next step is to find out if they are being used in other ways.
   Fitzwater sidestepped numerous questions about why the use of
imports needs to be reviewed when domestic weapons are not reviewed.
   While saying there has been no change in Bush's position,
Fitzwater also expanded the president's position beyond what Bush
told reporters when the question first arose last month.
   Bush had said at that time he would ``strongly oppose'' a ban on
semiautomatics. In subsequent remarks he said he was concerned about
the problem and had asked Bennett to come up with suggestions to
deal with it and still ``do what's right'' by the sportsman.
   Fitzwater said Wednesday that the president's original position
was that ``he does not favor banning the wepaons that are used by
sportsmen and are in compliance with the law.''
   ``He has said initially that he did not belive in banning these
guns until we looked into it. He was concerned about the problem.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle told The Associated Press he received
several ``inquiries'' from people concerned about the administration
action.
   He declined to elaborate, but said Bush ``was absolutely right to
enforce the existing regulations we have. ... I see it as a serious
attempt by President Bush to review the situation.''

<TEXT>
   Judge Alcides Guandique, who
became the first civilian judge in Salvadoran history to indict
military officers, is proud of his peasant farmer roots.
   ``But I knew I didn't want to return to the corn patch, to
milking cows. I studied hard, because I knew if I didn't pass, I'd
have to go back to that. Studying was like vacation for me,'' he
said.
   The 33-year-old judge was born in a one-room mud brick house in
the village of San Pedro, in the eastern province of San Miguel. Of
his six brothers and sisters, one is a doctor and three are teachers.
   ``Another sister is a `mojada,' in the United States,'' he said,
using the slang for illegal immigrant.
   ``I'm campesino-born, and proud of it,'' said the slight,
engaging official in an interview. He told of how he would go to
school ``with blisters on my hands and my face burned by the sun''
after doing chores.
   The father of two, he credits ``the sacrifice of our parents''
for his and his siblings' success.
   Guandique set a historic precedent Wednesday when he indicted two
army officers in connection with the September massacre of 10
peasant farmers in the nearby village of San Francisco.
   ``It has taken on international transcendence. But to me it's
like any other case. Some people were killed. Campesino lives are
just as valuable as any other lives. Those who did it must be
brought to justice, regardless of their position or power,'' he said.
   The previous judge in San Sebastian resigned late last year,
unwilling to assume the risk involved in pursuing the investigation.
Several judges have been killed while probing alleged military
abuses.
   ``Of course I'm afraid,'' Guandique said. ``Only machines have no
fear. But if I have problems because I equitably apply the law, then
it is not only my problem, but the problem of all judges.''
   Arriving from work at his modest home in Ilopango, a two-hour bus
trip from San Sebastian, Guandique goes first to a hammock and lifts
out 10-month-old baby Alcides, Jr.
   ``And what would you do if they made you a little orphan?'' he
laughingly asks the wide-eyed child in the kind of morbid jest he
says helps him deal with the strain.
   Cecilia, his wife, said, ``I try to give him courage, especially
when his friends tell him to back off, to think about his family and
not get in over his head.''
   But sometimes the couple's resolve fails. As they escorted a
visitor from their home down an alley toward the street, Guandique
stopped at the intersection with another narrow alley.
   ``Here is the kind of place someone could be waiting for me some
night,'' he said.
   Mrs. Guandique, like her husband campesino-born _ stoic and
hearty _ stood silently in the midday sun with tears brimming in her
dark eyes.

<HEAD>Kuwait Charges 33 With Attempting To Topple Rule</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official Kuwait news agency said Wednesday that
33 people were charged with offenses ranging from spying to trying
to topple the government.
   KUNA said those indicted were 18 Kuwaitis, nine Iraqis, two
Iranians, two Lebanese, a Briton of Lebanese origin and a stateless
person.
   It quoted an unidentified spokesman for the state prosecutor as
saying 18 suspects were held, two were free on bail and 13 were at
large.
   The report did not say when the crimes or the arrests took place,
nor did it specify for whom the purported spying was done.
   The names indicated the defendants were Shiite Moslems, the
predominant sect in Iran. Scores of Shiite activists were arrested
and tried in Kuwait during the eight-year war that raged between
Kuwait's Persian Gulf neighbors, Iran and Iraq, until a cease-fire
last August.
   Kuwait accused Iran in the past of inciting acts of terrorism in
this tiny, oil-rich northern gulf state.
   KUNA said the 33 suspects belonged to illegal groups that called
for overthrow of the regime and demeaned Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah. Some were also charged with divulging defense
secrets, embezzling public money and collusion to commit crimes
including assassination of public figures.
   Some of the charges are punishable by death.

   Anxious to please the customer with
convenience, if not a good movie, a local movie theater on Friday
will take credit cards for advance and same-day ticket purchases and
for concession stand sales.
   The new AMC Courthouse Plaza 8 Theater is set to become the first
theater in the nation in which this method will be tried, according
to the National Association of Theater Owners.
   ``It's a great convenience, one that customers around the country
have been asking for,'' said Charlie Stoessel, manager of the
theater. He said the theater will accept Visa, MasterCard and
Discover credit cards.
   ``It was done in England, and was a big success,'' Stoessel said
Wednesday.
   According to the plan, a customer can buy tickets over the phone
or at the theater with a credit card. For those who buy their
tickets in advance, there will be a separate window where the
tickets can be picked up.
   Moviegoers also can buy food and drinks at the theater by
purchasing vouchers on their credit card and then cashing them in at
the concession stand. Change will be given in cash.
   ``In other words, you can go to movies without a dime in your
pocket,'' Stoessel said.
   But credit card purchasers can't reserve seats and they must pay
a handling charge of 50 cents per ticket.
   Regardless, Stoessel said AMC Theaters of Kansas City expects
that 30 percent of its sales ultimately will be done by credit card.
   AMC will expand the credit-card policy, which it considers a
test, to its theaters in Union Station in Washington, D.C., said
Dick Dodderidge, senior vice president for corporate marketing.
   Meanwhile, K-B Theaters of Washington said Ticket Center outlets
in May will handle phone reservations for tickets to screenings of
several movies that are expected to draw long lines this summer,
such at ``Batman'' and ``Star Trek V.''

<TEXT>
   Millions of pounds of Chilean fruit were being
held Wednesday for tests at dockside at ports in Philadelphia, Los
Angeles and Miami while U.S. and Chilean officials discussed plans
for assuring the safety of the produce in the wake of a poisoning
attempt.
   In Philadelphia, where most Chilean fruit enters the United
States, Food and Drug Administration officials completed sampling of
the 362,000 crates of grapes and other fruit from the South American
country.
   No further contamination was found beyond the traces of cyanide
in two seedless red grapes among those sampled at the port in
Philadelphia on Sunday, the FDA said.
   ``This does not, however, mean the fruit will be released for
sale at this time,'' the agency said. ``It is being held and
refrigerated at the dock until the findings and the entire situation
can be evaluated.''
   The testing followed a March 2 telephone threat to the U.S.
embassy in Santiago warning that export fruit would be injected with
cyanide. After the contaminated grapes were found, the FDA warned
consumers not to eat any Chilean fruit and urged stores to take all
such produce off their shelves _ which at this time of year includes
virtually all fresh grapes.
   Supermarket produce shelves remained empty of Chilean fruit and
many stores posted signs assuring consumers that the fruit on
display didn't come from Chile.
   Meanwhile, U.S. officials met with representatives of the Chilean
government and U.S. fruit importers ``to develop a plan to
re-establish the safety and reliability'' of Chilean fruit, the FDA
said.
   ``One of the things they will be focusing on in the next day or
so is trying to come up with a plan to try to do the least economic
damage (to Chile) and assure the safety of the fruit supply,'' said
FDA spokesman Don McLearn.
   FDA workers inspected about 12,000 crates of fruit from the
Almeria Star, the ship on which the two contaminated grapes were
found, but the remaining 350,000 cases on board were put aside in
cold storage, said Richard J. Davis, regional director of the FDA's
mid-Atlantic region.
   ``We have not looked at every particular shipment or every
particular crate of grapes,'' he said. ``We set up a sampling plan
in the beginning that we thought was adequate to look at this
product and if there was something there we felt that our sampling
plan would find it and it did.''
   Inspections were continuing at ports in Los Angeles and Miami,
the FDA said.
   Some ships loaded with Chilean fruit, however, aren't coming into
port, but instead are anchoring off shore ``until some decision is
made'' as to how and when the produce will be distributed, McLearn
said.

   The Navy awarded a contract Wednesday to a
division of the Lockheed Corp. for production of Trident II nuclear
missiles, completing a deal worth almost $1 billion to the
California contractor.
   The service, in a brief statement, said the Lockheed Missiles and
Space Co. of Sunnyvale, Calif., would receive a
``cost-plus-incentive-fee contract'' valued at $921.6 million to
produce 64 of the new long-range, submarine-launched missiles.
   ``The work will be performed in Sunnyvale and is expected to be
completed in September 1991,'' the Navy added.
   The award comes at a time when the Navy is preparing its first
test shot of the Trident II from a Trident submarine, the USS
Tennessee, off the coast of Florida. That first submerged test is
expected within the next week or so. Previous tests have been
conducted from launch pads on land at Cape Canaveral, Fla.
   The Trident II has been billed by the Navy as offering a dramatic
improvement in accuracy compared to the Trident I missiles now
deployed on ballistic missile submarines. Lockheed is the developer
and prime contractor of both missiles.

<HEAD>NRC Vows Broader Security Probes Of Agency Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, responding
to charges of inadequate security controls, told a congressional
panel Wednesday it will take new steps to weed out agency workers
deemed potential risks.
   The NRC said it generally accepted the conclusions of a study by
the General Accounting Office that criticized the practice of
allowing newly hired personnel to start work without security
clearances and of not reinvestigating all veteran workers. The study
said these practices could jeopardize national security.
   The report by the GAO, which is the investigative arm of the
Congress, was released by a House Government Operations subcommittee
that requested the study in 1987.
   Hugh L. Thompson, Jr., the NRC's deputy executive director for
nuclear materials safety, said that while the agecy's personnel
security system is ``essentially sound,'' improvements would be
sought by accepting some of the GAO's recommendations.
   The key change promised by Thompson was to begin regular
reinvestigations of the roughly 50 percent of employees for whom
followup checks are not normally conducted. The other half of
employees are reinvestigated every five years. The agency previously
had cited financial reasons for not doing more reinvestigations.
   The GAO said stricter security controls on NRC employees is
increasingly important in light of recent spy scandals that showed
national security was more likely to be jeopardized by ``insiders''
than by foreign agents or saboteurs.
   ``It is obvious that a substantial tightening is called for'' at
the NRC, said Rep. Chuck Douglas, R-N.H., a member of the House
panel.
   Thompson took issue with one point in the auditors' report. He
said the GAO had overstated the frequency of cases in which newly
hired workers resign or are fired after a belated disclosure of
personal problems such as drug or alcohol abuse.
   The GAO report said about 10 percent of newly hired workers since
1983 left the NRC after background investigations disclosed serious
personal problems. Thompson said the correct figure was 0.5 percent.
Mary Ann Kruslicky, a GAO group director, said later that Thompson's
figure was right, but that the main point was that more thorough and
earlier background checks are needed.
   Responding to suggestions from members of the subcommittee,
Thompson said the NRC will consider checking applicants' fingerprint
records and academic credentials before putting them to work. But he
stressed that it was not practical to wait the 10-12 months required
for a complete background investigation.
   ``NRC believes that without the use of authority to hire
individuals prior to completion of background investigations, the
agency will not be able to continue to attract highly competent
technical and support staff of the calibre we have today,'' he said.
   Thompson acknowledged that 99 percent of newly hired personnel
start work without security clearances.
   The GAO said that its review of personnel security files revealed
several examples of potential security breaches involving workers
who had not gotten security clearances.
   It cited the case of a nuclear reactor engineer who began work
without a clearance in 1985. The worker required a clearance that
would grant access to top-secret national security information, and
in the subsequent investigation it was disclosed that the employee
used heroin and had overdosed on the drug in 1984. The worker
resigned during a one-year probation period.

<TEXT>
   Passengers aboard a Pan Am flight to Paris were
warned a caller had claimed a bomb was on the plane, but the airline
said Wednesday the caution did not reflect a policy change since the
explosion of a Pan Am plane over Scotland.
   Aviation officials said they were not aware of a previous
instance of an airline warning passengers of a bomb threat. Only 17
of the 200 passengers on the plane chose to take another flight
Monday.
   Pan American spokesman Alan Loflin said the action had nothing to
do with criticism for not warning passengers about an anonymous bomb
threat made against the carrier before Flight 103 exploded over
Scotland Dec. 21.
   ``(Flight) 103 is a whole different situation,'' he said
   The threat called in against Monday's Flight 114 was unusually
specific, Loflin said.
   ``There was never anything that resembled a threat against Pan Am
103. This one on 114 was clearly a threat against 114 by number, by
departure city and by destination,'' Loflin said.
   However, a spokesman for a passenger group said the warning
likely followed pressure over Flight 103. On Dec. 5, an anonymous
caller to the U.S. Embassy in Finland warned a bomb would be aboard
a Pan Am flight traveling from Frankfurt to the United States within
two weeks. Government officials later said the call was a hoax.
   The information was relayed by the State Department to its
overseas employees and Pan Am, and relatives of some of the 259
people killed in the crash were critical that passengers had no such
warning.
   ``I would suspect that the Pan Am 103 flight in December had
something to do with the decision to disseminate the information,''
said David Jeffrey, spokesman for Airline Passengers of America.
``We're certainly glad to see that the airline took the
responsibility of relaying the information.''
   Workers checked the plane and luggage while passengers were taken
to a special room. After the crew agreed the plane was safe to fly,
passengers were told of the threat and given the option of taking
alternate flights. The flight was about 1{ hours late and arrived in
Paris without incident.
   Marilyn Harding, a passenger who switched flights after the
warning, said they weren't told until minutes before boarding.
   ``Who wants to spend eight hours up there just wondering? I think
those people took a real gamble,'' she said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration has no directive on whether
to tell passengers about threats, said agency spokesman Fred Farrar.
   ``Whatever they do is up to them,'' Farrar said.
   Thousands of bomb threats are called into airlines each year, but
virtually all are groundless, he said, adding that he did not know
of any previous passenger warnings.
   Jeffrey said that if all threats were relayed, ``anybody with a
quarter could throw the whole aviation system out of whack.''
   But he said the passenger association believes that if the
threats have been released from security agencies to the general
public, as in the posting of the state department warning, the
public should be told.

   College costs rose much faster than inflation
for in-state undergraduate students attending state colleges and
universities, with the average hike 6.3 percent last fall, says a
survey released Wednesday.
   The 1987-88 hike surpassed the 1986-87 boost of 5.4 percent,
according to the annual survey by the American Association of State
Colleges and Universities and the National Association of State
Universities and Land-Grant Colleges.
   The latest increase also outpaced the 1988 inflation rate, which
was 4.4 percent according to the Consumer Price Index.
   The average price of full-time attendance in fall 1988, including
tuition, fees, room and board, was $4,397 for in-state undergrads,
the survey found. That's $302 more than they paid in 1987.
   The authors said the increasing charges reflect ``a shifting
balance in the share of costs paid by students, their parents and
public resources.''
   As in the past two surveys, they said, ``faculty salary increases
and equipment and facilities replacement or repair are the most
frequently cited factors in tuition increases.'' Other reasons given
included inflation, decreased appropriations and legislative action
on costs.
   The state with the highest rate of increase was Oklahoma, where
the legislature has mandated tuition hikes of 15 to 20 percent for
each of the next four years, said AASCU spokesman Mike Mulnix.
``It's still fairly reasonable. The average will be right around
$2,000 a year for tuition and fees'' this year, Mulnix said. ``But
percentage-wise, it's a large increase.''
   On the bright side, the survey found that 67 schools held
in-state undergraduate charges constant and 14 actually lowered
their tuition and fees in 1988.
   The declines occurred at four schools in New York, three in
Virginia, two each in Alaska, Georgia and West Virginia, and one in
Texas.
   Charges stayed the same at 22 schools in New York, 15 in Texas,
seven in Mississippi, five in Alabama, four in Arkansas, two each in
Montana, Puerto Rico, Idaho and South Carolina, and one each in
Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota, Missouri, North Carolina and
Wisconsin.
   The survey was based on questionnaires filled out by 537 public
colleges and universities. Results reflect the costs of attending
about 90 percent of the nation's publicly assisted, four-year
institutions of higher education, the study said.

<HEAD>Dry Conditions May Continue In Some Prime Farm Land</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Recent precipitation and promising forecasts
show ``substantial improvement'' from dry conditions around the
country as the spring planting season nears, but a top federal
forecaster said Wednesday there are still some troubling exceptions
for prime farmland.
   Norton D. Strommen, the chief meteorologist at the Department of
Agriculture, said dry areas with unfavorable forecasts include
portions of central and western Kansas extending into the Oklahoma
and Texas panhandles, California and the Texas gulf coast.
   Another critically dry pocket of prime farmland, covering western
Illinois, eastern and southern Iowa and northern Missouri, however,
has good prospects for rain, Strommen said after a briefing with the
House Agriculture Committee.
   ``We've come a long way in terms of improving sil moisture (since
the devastating 1988 drought),'' Strommen said. ``The signs are very
encouraging we will not have that repeated as we approach the
planting season. It's a much more encouraging picture than we had
any reason to hope for.''
   Among trouble spots, however, are the Oklahoma and Texas
panhandles and an area of western Kansas, where moisture has been
less than 50 percent of normal throughout the winter months,
Strommen said.
   He is also concerned about the dryness that has developed along
the gulf coast, particularly in Texas and extreme southern Florida.
   And after a good early season start on the ``snowpack belt'' in
the West, there has been a ``sharp drying out in January and
February,'' Strommen said.
   Reservoir levels have been drawn down by last summer's drought,
and forecasts indicate it's doubtful California will see a
significant addition to its snowpack before the end of the winter
rainy season in April, Strommen said.
   ``It is an area of great concern to us at this point. They have
already started to restrict some of the water use patterns in
California,'' he said.
   Although this week's rains were ``highly beneficial'' in central
and northern Califoria as far as the winter wheat crop is concerned,
``they did not add a lot to the snowpack situation,'' Strommen said.
   Strommen said there is also concern some of the shallower wells
will not be able to provide adequate water across central portions
of the country, including the Oklahoma and Texas panhandles.
   ``We've seen an increase in top soil moisture, but not enough,''
Strommen said. ``It is enough now to germinate a crop, but it has
not added to deep soil moisture reserves. That means we have not
increased water table levels.''
   There is also concern about reservoir levels in the Southeast,
Strommen said.

<TEXT>
   A famine in northeast Mozambique has
killed almost 5,000 people this year, and tens of thousands are
suffering from acute food shortages made worse by a guerrilla war,
the national news agency AIM reported Wednesday.
   Catholic missionaries told AIM the deaths occurred in Memba, a
coastal region about 240 miles south of the border with Tanzania.
AIM quoted the missionaries as saying Tuesday that the toll now
stood at 4,810.
   Three-fourths of the 184,000 people in Memba face serious food
shortages, according to a representative of Radio Mozamique in
northern Nampula city.
   Some of the hardest hit areas are only 30 miles from the busy
port city of Nacala, which has an adequate food supply, AIM reported.
   Poor transportation and communications systems hampered relief
operations. Many people in Memba have survived on wild roots and
fruit since August, but the government relief agency did not know
how bad things were until this year, AIM reported.
   In the past week, relief workers have been trying to transport 60
tons of food to the town of Memba each day by road and by boat.
However, once the food reaches Memba there is no guarantee it will
make it to those in need because of poor or non-existent roads, AIM
said. It said local relief organizations are trying to get
helicopters to supply some of the more remote villages.
   The news agency also said people are moving south to flee
Mozambique's civil war. It noted that a widespread migration could
mean that few crops will be planted this year and the famine could
get worse.
   The 12-year-old war pits the Marxist government against rebels of
the Mozambique National Resistance, who have seriously disrupted the
country's economy with hit-and-run attacks on military and civilian
targets.

<HEAD>US, Latins Reported Agreed on $22.5 Billion for Loans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and other donor governments
have settled a three-year quarrel with Latin American nations and
now are ready to make another $22.5 billion available to support
loans in the Western Hemisphere over the next four years, sources
said Wednesday.
   Agreement was expected to be announced at a meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank in Amsterdam next week. The loans
would be made through the bank, which is owned by 44 countries.
   The U.S. Treasury, which is in charge of the negotiations, had no
comment on the reports. A State Department official said
negotiations were still going on.
   The reports came after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady issued a
proposal last Friday for reducing debts to commercial banks, to
which Latin American countries owe more than $400 billion.
   The sources, who spoke on condition they not be named, said the
United States had failed in an attempt to get the right to delay a
loan for as long as two years _ a delay which would amount to a veto.
   Present rules in the Inter-American Development Bank require only
a 50 percent vote to approve a loan. The United States cannot stop
most loans, since it usually has less than 35 percent of the voting
power.
   In 1987 James A. Baker III, then Treasury secretary, said the
bank needed more money but that he wanted to be sure it was well
used.
   ``The United States is willing to work to secure this funding,
but only if the appropriate checks and balances are adopted and lead
to improvements in lending quality,'' he told delegates to a meeting
in Miami.
   Baker is now secretary of state. Bank President Antonio Ortiz
Mena, a Mexican who opposed the changes Baker sought, has given way
to Enrique V. Iglesias of Uruguay. A former high-level Treasury
official, James W. Conrow, has become his deputy.
   Under the new arrangement a 12-month delay would require 40
percent of the votes on the bank's board of directors, the sources
said. The United States has 34.57 percent of the vote and it counts
on support from Canada, which has 4.38 percent of the vote. But
their 38.95 percent total falls just short of the 40 percent hurdle.
   In accordance with its voting power, the United States would make
the largest contribution: about $7.8 billion. One source said that
if past arrangements are followed only 4.5 percent of that _ about
$350 million _ actually would have to be paid out over the four-year
period. The rest of the U.S. contribution and those of other donors
would only be on call if needed.
   In the past, such calls have not been made but the assurance that
they could be enables the bank to borrow cheaply on world markets
and make its own loans to the American republics on easier terms
than commercial banks would give.
   The Inter-American Development Bank, which has its headquarters
in Washington, has been lending over $2 billion a year for projects
to raise living standards. Most money goes for farm projects, with
large amounts for energy and transport.
   Since 1961, the largest sums have gone to Brazil _ the Third
World's largest debtor _ followed by Mexico and Argentina. Of the 17
donor countries, Canada is the second largest contributor, followed
by Japan and West Germany.

   Iran said Wednesday that Iraq captured

accusations that Iranian troops violated the truce, the Islamic

   The official Iranian news agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted
Deputy Foreign Minister Mohammad Hussein Lavasani as saying Iraq
seized 700 troops and a number of civilians since cease-fire began
in August and ended eight years of fighting.
   Lavasani said in a note handed to the Tehran office of the
International Committee of the Red Cross that ``more than six months
have gone by and there has not been any news on the captivity of
these individuals,'' the agency said.
   He appealed to the Swidd-based ICRC to secure ``the immediate
release of these POWs, who were taken captive in violation of the
Third Geneva Convention.''
   Lavasani was quoted as saying Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz
promised Iraq would release these prisoners in the near future
during the first round of cease-fire talks in Geneva in August,
``but this claim had been proven to be a political gesture.''
   Tens of thousands of POWs were taken by Iran and Iraq during the
Persian Gulf war. The two countries are yet to agree whether the
POWs would be released before or as a part of an overall setlement
of their conflict.
   However, both sides have released hundreds of elderly and
war-crippled prisoners of war.
   Iran also denied Wednesday earlier Iraqi accusations that it
violated the cease-fire, IRNA reported.
   It quoted an unnamed source at Iran's Armed Forces Command
Headquarters as saying the cease-fire was violated by Iraqi forces
late Monday night when they shelled three Iranian cities across the
southern border.
   The source said Iraqi forces opened fire on the city of
Shalamcheh, and extended the shelling to the port of Khorramshahr.
The Iranians did not return fire until the Iraqis started shelling
Khorramshahr and then Abadan, a key industrial city, IRNA said.
   The source said the United Nations cease-fire monitoring force
watched the whole incident, in which five Iranian troops were
wounded.
   He said Iran reported 14 cease-fire violations between Feb. 20
and March 10 to the U.N. monitoring group.
   An Iraqi military spokesman said the Iranians shelled the
positions of an infantry division in the southern port city of
Basra, official Baghdad radio reported on Tuesday. The radio said
the U.N. observers did not comment on the incident but confirmed an
Iraqi complaint had been registered.
   The two belligerents agreed in January to form a joint military
committee to help the U.N. observers consolidate the cease-fire
agreement, but it has not yet held any meetings.
   On Tuesday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati proposed
that peace talks with Iraq should resume in the third week of April.
   United Nations-sponsored peace talks in the 8-year gulf war
started five days after the U.N.-mediated cease-fire took effect
Aug. 20, but the talks broke down immediately over the issue of
Iraqi troop withdrawals and the status of the Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   According to United Nations estimates, Iraqi troops still occupy
about 260 square miles of Iranian territory.

   Even if Mikhail S. Gorbachev's economic
reforms succeed, the Soviet Union won't be able to bridge the
technological gap with the West by the year 2000, said a NATO report
released Wednesday.
   The report, drawn up by U.S. experts, said Gorbachev's drive to
restructure the economy will make some progress but not as much as
the Soviets predict.
   ``Even if Gorbachev wins, the gains from new technology and
enhanced labor productivity will not suffice to narrow the gap with
the West during the remainder of this century,'' said the report,
prepared for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   It also said poor weather could ``trigger an agricultural failure
severe enough to exacerbate current consumer dissatisfaction and
threaten the success of Gorbachev's reform effort.''
   Another NATO report released Wednesday said the failure of
perestroika to produce major changes gives the Kremlin ``cogent
reasons'' to pare the amount of money devoted to defense in its
five-year plan for 1991 to 1995.
   ``Barring an unlikely turnaround in the economy,'' it said, ``we
would expect the pressure to hold down defense spending to continue
during 1991-95.''
   The report noted Gorbachev's promises to slash defense spending
by 14.2 percent but said no details have been released on where
those cuts would be made or during what period of time.
   It estimated Soviet defense expenditures grew at an average
annual rate of just under 2 percent during 1975-87. Outlays in 1975
were 90 billion to 95 billion rubles, or $145 billion to $153
billion at the official exchange rate. They rose to 110 billion to
120 billion rubles in 1987, or $178 billion to $194 billion. The
figures were adjusted for inflation.
   The analysts said the defense sector was a heavy drain on the
Soviet economy, absorbing 15 percent to 17 percent of the gross
domestic product, the total economic output, in the mid-1980s. In
comparison, U.S. defense spending was about 6.5 percent of economic
output, it said.
   ``The burden of defense falls unevenly across the Soviet economy
and is especially heavy in those civilian sectors where needs are
greatest if Gorbachev is to succeed in modernizing industry,'' it
said.
   Military development and production capture a large number of the
best scientists, technologists, engineers and skilled technicians.
Moreover, military facilities have better access to electronic
components, special steels, non-ferrous metals, chemicals and oil
products, it said.
   In the economic study, analysts used a CIA economic model to look
at three alternatives for growth from 1986 to 2000.
   The most positive _ ``Gorbachev wins'' _ projects the stagnant
economy will pick up to expand at a healthy 2.9 percent average
annual rate in the period from 1991 to 2000. To achieve that rate,
reforms would have to be successful and weather conditions good for
farming.
   A ``Gorbachev loses'' outlook sees the economy expanding at a
poor 1.6 percent annually from 1991 to 2000.
   A third scenario of ``Gorbachev doesn't matter'' predicts growth
of 1.5 percent annually in that same period.

   The Washington Apple Commission voted
unanimously Wednesday to spend $1.7 million for advertising to
reassure consumers that apples are safe, despite nationwide concerns
over Alar use.
   The commission, which represents growers of the nation's largest
apple crop, voted to take $1 million in emergency funds and borrow
$669,000 from banks to purchase advertising in major markets around
the country.
   Concerns over the suspected carcinogen showed little sign of
abating as Eddie Albert and other Hollywood entertainers held a news
conference to urge mothers to demand that their grocers carry
chemical-free produce.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council, whose recent report
touched off the furor, warned the apple commission to be careful
about the content of its advertising.
   ``We assume they are not going to be impugning our integrity,''
said Paul Allen, a spokesman for the non-profit Washington,
D.C.-based environmental group. ``That would be a great mistake on
their part.''
   The goal of the NRDC report is not to hurt farmers, but to change
the policies of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and make it
easier to ban certain chemicals, Allen said
   Apple commission spokeswoman Vicky Scharlau said the advertising,
to begin later this month, will seek only to reassure consumers that
apples are safe and that the present system regulating chemicals is
effective.
   ``This isn't a war between the apple industry and the NRDC,'' she
told a packed house of growers at the commission meeting.
   The NRDC report, released in late February, contends that eating
Alar-treated apples increases the cancer risk in children. The
report has been attacked as alarmist by the federal Environmental
Protection Agency and the findings have been disputed by some
scientists and the apple industry.
   But public fears have led school districts across the country,
including those in New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, to ban apples
and apple products from cafeterias.
   Alar is the marketing name for daminozide, which is manufactured
by Uniroyal Chemical Co. The industry contends only about 5 percent
of the crop is sprayed with the growth regulator, which keeps apples
on the tree longer and thus improves color and firmness in red
varieties and also allows a longer harvest period.
   A Washington state farmworker group on Wednesday sent a letter to
the apple commission, urging the use of less chemicals.
   ``The Alar controversy brings to light the concerns farmworkers
have about pesticides,'' said George Finch, a director of the
2,800-member Centro Campensino farmworker advocacy group that has
often spoken out against improper chemical use.
   Eddie Albert and several other actors held a news conference in
Los Angeles Wednesday on behalf of Mothers and Others for Pesticide
Limits, which was founded by actress Meryl Streep. Ms. Streep has
been a vocal supporter of the NRDC report.
   ``Now mothers are angry,'' said Albert, who was joined by Rhea
Perlman, Pam Dawber, Olivia Newton-John and ``thirtysomething''
performers Patricia Wettig and Mel Harris.
   The Washington Apple Commission, which represents growers of the
nation's largest apple crop, is hoping to counter that kind of
publicity with its new advertising campaign.
   ``I hate to borrow money,'' said Commissioner Ross Larson. But
other commissioners argued that the issue was critical and the
industry had no choice but to respond.
   The grower-financed Apple Commission has already spent more than
$1 million of its normal $6.4 million advertising budget in the Alar
fight, primarily doing public relations work and purchasing
full-page newspaper ads in the past two weeks in 44 of the nation's
largest newspapers.
   The new $1.6 million allocation is in addition to the regular
advertising budget, and the content of the ads has not been
determined.
   Washington has one-quarter of the nation's commercial apple
growers and produces half the supermarket crop in a normal year.
   Other advertising campaigns are under way by the International
Apple Institute of McLean, Va., and by Tree Top Inc. of Selah,
Wash., the largest apple juice processor in the world.

   A Chicago native who moved to the Soviet Union
in 1931 said he felt overwhelmed when he arrived in Israel
Wednesday, ending a 13-year struggle to emigrate.
   Abe Stolar, 78, landed at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport with his
wife, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren.
   ``It's all too much to take in at once,'' he told reporters.
   Stolar and his parents left Chicago for the Soviet Union when he
was 19 because ``my parents were Communists and they were
disillusioned with life in the United States during the Great
Depression,'' he said. ``My father believed he could help the Soviet
Union.''
   Stolar said he was a loyal Soviet soldier during World War II,
but he became fed up with life in his adopted nation after the war
ended in 1945.
   He said he found anti-Semitism rampant in Soviet society and
believed he was dismissed from a job with Radio Moscow's English
language division after the war because he is Jewish.
   ``I began to read literature about the Holocaust and Jewish
history,'' after leaving the radio station, Stolar said. ``I began
to identify with the Jewish people.''
   Stolar applied for a visa to leave the Soviet Union in 1974 and
was granted permission in June 1975.
   But as he and his family were about to board a plane to Europe,
the KGB stopped them, saying Stolar's wife, Gita, had access to
state secrets in her job as a chemist at a geology institute.
   Stolar tried to enlist the support of world leaders in his fight
to leave the Soviet Union after he was repeatedly denied another
emigration visa.
   Last year President Reagan made a personal appeal to Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev for Stolar's release.

<HEAD>Military Government Talks With Opposition For First Time In Five
Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres discussed
proposed constitutional changes Wednesday with the opposition in the
first talks the military government has accepted with its foes in
five years.
   The opposition's chief spokesman, Patricio Aylwin, the first such
leader invited to the government palace under the 15-year-old
military government, called his 30-minute talk with Caceres
``positive.''
   Caceres said some proposals submitted by Aylwin for democratic
changes to the constitution were ``interesting.''
   Aylwin is president of the centrist Christian Democratic Party
and spokesman for a 17-party opposition coalition. He is considered
a front-runner to the nomination as the opposition's single
presidential candidate in the election scheduled for Dec. 14.
   The meeting was part of a series of talks opened Tuesday by the
government with pro-government and opposition politicians to seek an
agreement on changes to the 1980 military-written constitution.
   The day before, Caceres met with Sergio Jarpa, president of the
right-wing National Vanguard party. He is scheduled to meet another
right-wing leader Thursday.
   President Gen. Augusto Pinochet announced Saturday in his annual
state-of-the-nation message that he is willing to consider some key
democratic changes sought by dissidents. It was the first time the
73-year-old president and army commander accepted such a possibility.
   Pinochet made clear that his idea is ``to perfect'' the
constitution, ``not to dismantle it.'' He said he would study
proposals to amend an article banning Marxism, to shorten the
present eight-year presidential term and to eliminate the
president's emergency power to exile citizens.
   The president also said the changes may include adding one
member, probably a civilian, to a powerful military-dominated
National Security Council, and to ease the requirements for future
constitutional changes.
   Any constitutional changes would have to be approved in a
national referendum, which government sources say could take place
next June.
   Aylwin suggested Caceres set up a commission of government and
opposition constitutional experts to come up with a joint proposal
for the changes. He did not disclose the minister's reaction to his
proposal.
   It was the first high-level contact between the Pinochet
government and the opposition since an aborted dialogue five years
ago, when the government was shaken by a series of street protests
that left scores dead.
   Pinochet took power in a violent 1973 coup that toppled the
elected government of Salvador Allende, a Marxist. Allende died in
the takeover.

officials said.
   Federal Highway Police said the drivers of the bus and truck that

Tlaxcala, capital of Tlaxcala state. Tlaxcala is 60 miles east of

   Mourners mixed with curiosity seekers, reporters
and law enforcement officials at the funeral Wednesday for reputed
mob boss Joseph Ferriola, laid to rest with a prayer that God would
welcome him ``in mercy.''
   About 150 mourners, including a number of young women in furs and
jewelry and men in expensive tailored suits, paid their respects in
a flower-filled funeral chapel on the city's far West Side.
   About 75 journalists, photographers, law agents and onlookers
gathered across the street. Some waited more than an hour to get a
glimpse of family and acquaintances of Ferriola, said by authorities
to have started out in gambling and extortion, rising through the
ranks to become organized crime's chieftain in Chicago and its
suburbs.
   Ferriola, 61, died Saturday in a Houston hospital reportedly
after two heart-transplant operations.
   ``When they put the casket in the hearse, I thought that he is
really just an ordinary person and I felt sorry for his family,''
said Susan Trella, a resident of the nearby middle-class
neighborhood, who added she came for ``the excitement.
   ``I felt sorry for the family like I would for anybody else's
family,'' said Mrs. Trella, who'd bundled up her 3-year-old son,
Anthony, for the wait. ``My husband says this isn't history, but it
is.''
   A rumor spread through the crowd that a yellow van parked across
the street was the mobile base for agents collecting videotapes and
photographs for organized-crime files.
   Neighborhood resident Eileen Klein said she was on her way to do
her grocery shopping when she noticed the television cameras. She
said she came to see if any of her favorite local TV reporters were
there.
   As for Ferriola, ``I know he was in the syndicate, but I didn't
know the man,'' she said.
   Two men were comparing the number of out-of-state license plates
they'd counted. They declined to identify themselves.
   ``The big boys ... the people who are supposed to take over
(heading the crime operation in Chicago) didn't show up,'' one said.
   ``This was a bustout,'' he said, ``and you can call me an
`informed source.'''
   The FBI and the Chicago Crime Commission, a private
crime-watchdog group, said they'd have no comment on who attended
the service.
   Though the family requested that no flowers be sent, the funeral
chapel was lined with mums, roses, bird-of-paradise blooms and other
exotic flowers _ at least 40 floral pieces _ arranged in the shapes
of hearts, teardrops and crucifixes.
   A Roman Catholic priest stood in front of Ferriola's
rosary-draped casket to lead a simple 10-minute service.
   He prayed that God would welcome Ferriola ``in mercy.''
   He also spoke directly to Ferriola's five children, telling them
they should understand two things.
   Their father had wanted to see them grow up, the priest said, and
people don't ``get sick and die because of anything they do or you
do.''

<TEXT>
   Premier-designate Ante Markovic, a
reformer and successful businessman, announced a trimmer government
Wednesday to carry the battle against Yugoslavia's worst economic
crisis since World War II.
   His Cabinet will have 19 ministers, compared with 29 in the
outgoing administration of Branko Mikulic, and will be a combination
of politicians and technocrats. He and his government are to be
sworn in Thursday.
   Parliament approved a 1989 budget Wednesday totaling the
equivalent of $3 billion, a 165 percent increase reflecting
inflation that has reached an annual rate of 346 percent, according
to government figures.
   Yugoslavia's federal budget covers only defense, aid to
underdeveloped regions, government salaries and retirement benefits.
All other expenditures are covered in budgets of the six member
republics.
   The economic crisis has caused labor unrest and exacerbated
problems between ethnic groups in the nation's loose federation.
   In Kosovo, an autonomous province that was the heart of ancient
Serbia, 2,000 miners defied government orders to end a strike that
began Feb. 21. About 90 percent of the people in the poor southern
region are ethnic Albanians, and Serbian residents complain of
discrimination.
   Markovic, an advocate of market-oriented economic reform, is a
former president of the Croatian republic. Mikulic's government
resigned Dec. 30, becoming the first to do so since the Communist
Party gained power after World War II under the late President Tito.
   Political, ethnic and economic problems have increased since Tito
died in 1980 and was succeeded by a collective presidency, which has
proved ineffectual. Mikulic resigned because his government was
unable to solve those problems.
   As deputy premiers, Markovic selected Alexandar Mitrovic, vice
president of Serbia, the largest republic, and Zivko Pregl,
executive secretary of Slovenia's Communist Party, the official news
agency Tanjug reported.
   His choices indicate a balanced position between Slovenia, which
advocates a market economy and political pluralism, and Serbia,
which wants more centralism and political orthodoxy.
   Foreign Minister Budimir Loncar and Gen. Veljko Kadijevic, the
defense minister, will continue in those jobs.
   Gen. Petar Gracanin, president of Serbia, is to be interior
minister and Branko Zekan, manager of a large Croatian insurance
company, will become finance minister, Tanjug said.

<HEAD>Energy Chief Says Cost Estimates May Be Overblown</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cleanup of contamination and radioactive waste
at the government's 12-state nuclear weapons complex may cost much
less than the $60 billion to $100 billion commonly estimated, Energy
Secretary James D. Watkins told Congress Wednesday.
   ``I believe we can do this for a lot less,'' Watkins told a
Senate Budget subcommittee in his first appearance on Capitol Hill
since his swearing in last week.
   Watkins did not make his own estimate but promised to produce
later this year a detailed blueprint, including cost projections,
for an initial five-year effort to clean up the weapons sites and
modernize the aging facilities.
   On a related topic, Watkins disclosed he is seeking to persuade
the Federal Aviation Administration to reestablish limits on
airplane flights over the Savannah River Plant nuclear facility near
Aiken, S.C., which includes three nuclear reactors that produce
material used in atomic warheads. Only a voluntary restriction has
existed since 1976, when aviation authorities ended tighter limits.
   ``We've got to take a look all around'' the nuclear weapons
complex for ways of limiting the threat of an air attack, Watkins
said.
   The Energy Department, in an estimate published before Watkins
took over, said modernization and cleanup of the weapons complex
would cost at leaset $81 billion over the next 21 years. The General
Accounting Office has put the cost at over $100 billion.
   In testimony before the Senate panel, Keith O. Fultz, the GAO's
director of energy issues, said current cost estimates probably were
too low, given that no one yet knows how bad some of the
contamination is and the feasibility of cleanup.
   Watkins refuted this. He said scenarios for accomplishing the
cleanup often contained ``gold watches,'' or frills that are too
expensive and not needed.
   Watkins also said he was confident his department could safely
restart the Savannah River Plant nuclear reactors in South Carolina,
which are the nation's only source of tritium, a radioactive gas
needed in the manufacture of nuclear warheads. The three reactors
have been closed for nearly a year because of safety concerns.
   ``I believe we can get those reactors up,'' he said, adding that
he planned to meet soon with senior executives of Westinghouse
Electric Corp., which on April 1 takes over for E.I. du Pont de
Nemours &amp; Co. as contract manager at Savannah River.
   The Energy Department and Westinghouse have said they would
produce a detailed plan for restarting the Savannah River reactors
by the end of this month.
   The timing of a restart at Savannah River is considered important
because the shutdown of production there has raised questions about
the adequacy of U.S. tritium supplies.
   Watkins said he already was developing a plan that would get the
Savannah River reactors running again and keep them in safe
operation for at least a decade _ time enough to allow for the
construction of a new generation of reactors.
   He defended the Bush administration's plan for spending $6.8
billion to build two new tritium-producing reactors, one at Savannah
River and the other in Idaho. Critics have said only one, and
possible none, will be needed in the foreseeable future.
   Robert B. Barker, the Pentagon's assistant secretary for atomic
energy, told the panel the two new reactors would be capable of
producing 150 percent of the nation's tritium needs. He strongly
defended the plan, saying extra production capacity was needed to
guard against unforeseen technical or other problems.
   Watkins rejected suggestions from some public interest groups
that postponing or cancelling the new reactor projects could serve
as a basis for negotiating U.S. and Soviet limits on production of
nuclear materials, including plutonium.
   ``We aren't yet at a point in arms control where we can throw
away our bargaining chips,'' he said, while acknowledging that
future arms control agreements could leave the United States with
excess capacity for nuclear materials.
   ``We may have to eat some of the dollars we're putting into
these,'' he said.
   He likened the reactor issue to the development and production of
Pershing 2 and ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missiles that cost
the United States about $10 billion. Those missiles are now being
destroyed under terms of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces
treaty, although many never were deployed in the field.

<DATELINE>TALMON, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jewish settlers drove a mobile
home up a hillside through rain and hail Wednesday to stake a new
settlement in the occupied West Bank.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, two teen-age Palestinian guerrillas
were captured after they infiltrated from Egypt and attacked an
Israeli military outpost with a rifle and grenades. They were
wounded, but no troops were hurt, the army said.
   A handful of religious Jewish settlers arrived at Talmon, a
hilltop spot 12 miles from Jerusalem in the heart of the West Bank,
where Palestinians have been rebelling against Israeli rule for the
last 15 months.
   ``This place belongs to us,'' said one settler, Yachanan Indech,
25. ``All this land was mentioned in the Bible.''
   But he said the main importance of the site was strategic.
   ``If it were a clear day, you could see the whole city of Tel
Aviv from this hilltop, without a telescope,'' he said. ``With a
small weapon, you could hit any plane that lands at the
international airport.''
   Indech said that by the end of the week, 12 families with
children would move to the site.
   Soldiers were stationed on the hilltop to protect the new
settlement, and the settlers planned to circle the site with coils
of barbed wire before nightfall.
   The Jewish activists vowed that seven more of the controversial
settlements would be established in the occupied territory during
the next four years, as promised by the government.
   The United States has said the 130 Jewish settlements and 80,000
settlers already in the occupied lands constitute a major stumbling
block to peace. About 1.7 million Arabs live in the territories.
   Anti-Israeli protests continued in the occupied territories, and
at least eight Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
troops, Arab reports and hospital officials said. The army said it
was checking the reports.
   Since the beginning of the uprising in December 1987, 396
Palestinians and 17 Israelis have been killed.
   The two Palestinian infiltrators slipped across the southern
border before dawn, the army said.
   A military source who spoke on condition of anonymity said their
attack failed when a grenade hurled at the military outpost rolled
back onto the guerrillas' position and exploded, injuring at least
one of the Arabs. Soldiers opened fire after hearing an explosion,
the source said.
   The guerrillas, ages 15 and 17, were wounded and captured, the
army said.
   During interrogation the teen-agers said they were members of the
fundamentalist Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, the army said in
a statement.
   Military sources said they were planning to kill soldiers, take
hostages and return to Egypt.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, head of Israel's southern command,
charged that the attack was carried out with the knowledge of PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat and his Fatah guerrillas but without help
from the Egyptians.
   ``According to the terrorists being questioned ... (they went)
with the knowledge of Fatah, and with the knowledge of Abu Ammar,''
or Arafat, Mordechai said.
   He praised the Egyptians for helping find the route the
guerrillas had taken and mounting a search for accomplices.
   It was the third foiled guerrilla raid this week following two in
Lebanon. It came after U.S. officials reportedly sought to work out
a cease-fire between Israel and the Palestine Liberation
Organization to stop infiltrations from Lebanon.
   Attempts to arrange a cease-fire were reported by the
English-language Jerusalem Post newspaper before Foreign Minister
Moshe Arens left for the United States on March 10.
   Army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed in
southern Lebanon this year while attempting to cross into Israel.
Five were killed in the two attempts earlier this week.
   The United States has asked the PLO to halt such attacks, but the
group has said that raids on military targets were not included when
Arafat renounced terrorism last year.

<HEAD>Possible Eastern Sale Becomes Stronger Option for Lorenzo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The sale of Eastern Airlines is an increasingly
likely option for parent Texas Air Corp. as the crippling strike
against the carrier continues with no sign of resolution, experts
said Wednesday.
   On the 12th day of a bitter strike by Eastern's Machinists union,
the airline still was operating only a fraction of its normal
flights. Most of Eastern's pilots have continued honoring the strike
despite appeals and warnings from management, making it virtually
impossible for the airline to expand service.
   Eastern sought protection from creditors last Thursday under
Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act. But financial analysts and
other observers suggested that Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo
would have difficulty rebuilding Eastern through Chapter 11 and may
be reaching a point where he is obliged to sell the ailing carrier
to stem his losses.
   The strongest potential buyer remains financier Carl Icahn, the
owner and chairman of Trans World Airlines Inc., according to labor
and financial sources close to the situation who asked not to be
identified.
   Icahn expressed interest in buying Eastern last October and the
Machinists said last week that they want him to explore a possible
buyout. By acquiring Eastern, Icahn could use the airline's
north-south routes as possible feeders into TWA's trans-Atlantic
routes.
   Another possible buyer is Grandview, a group of investors and
former corporate executives, the sources said. The group's strongest
suit is said to be management expertise, giving it the belief that
it could negotiate contracts with Eastern's unions that Lorenzo was
unable to get.
   Icahn and representatives of Grandview did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
   Some major airlines also have been rumored to be looking at
Eastern, but the stories have been denied by spokesmen for the
carriers.
   Eastern's value to potential buyers is its assets _ planes,
airport gates, lucrative New York-Florida routes. Other carriers
believe they could deploy them more effectively than Lorenzo has,
and thus turn the airline around.
   Lorenzo, who controls Eastern through his Texas Air holding
company, has become a lightning rod for employees' anger.
   Lorenzo has asked his investment bankers at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. to gauge potential interest in buying Eastern among
investors and other airlines, according to the sources.
   Although Texas Air has attempted to gauge buying interest in the
past, the latest development seemed to indicate a more serious
attempt to find a potential buyer, some financial analysts said.
   Some airline union leaders saw it as a possible admission of
defeat by Lorenzo, but they conceded it could be a tactical maneuver.
   ``We'd love to see him find a buyer for Eastern,'' said Jim
Conley, a spokesman for the International Association of Machinists
at the union's Washington headquarters.
   Drexel declined to confirm that it had been approached by Lorenzo.
   Houston-based Texas Air said in a statement: ``Texas Air has
dealt with many investment bankers in the past, including Drexel
Burnham. Beyond that, Texas Air is only doing what it prudently
should in exercising its fiduciary responsibility to its
shareholders and its creditors.''
   Some observers say the pressure on Lorenzo to sell the airline
intensified Tuesday when the Air Line Pilots Association threw a
crimp into any Eastern effort to sell it piecemeal. ALPA, the
national pilots union, announced that its members would refuse to
fly Eastern routes for a carrier that purchased Eastern planes or
routes unless Eastern pilots were hired by that carrier.
   ALPA's executive board also said it had authorized strike benefit
payments of $2,400 a month plus interest-free loans for every
Eastern pilot honoring the Machinists' picket lines.
   The pilots' continuing refusal to cross picket lines has
``clearly limited (Lorenzo's) options,'' said Ron Cole, a spokesman
for the Eastern pilots union in Miami.

   President Bush has selected James Roderick
Lilley as his ambassador to the People's Republic of China,
succeeding Ambassador Winston Lord, the White House said Wednesday.
   Lilley, a longtime foreign service official, served as ambassador
to South Korea from 1986 until this past January.
   Previously he held a number of posts in Asia, including the
government's senior intelligence position on China, serving as
national intelligence officer for China in 1975.
   Bush was the U.S. liaison officer in China during 1975-76 before
the government had full diplomatic relations with the Chinese
   Lilley has served in U.S. missions in the Philippines, Taiwan,
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Hong Kong and China.
   In 1981, he worked for President Reagan's National Security
Council as political coordinator and senior east Asian specialist.
From 1984 to 1985 he was an international security consultant for
the Pentagon, and then during 1985-86 was deputy assistant secretary
of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs.
   Bush also announced Wednesday his choice of anti-abortion
activist Kay Coles James as assistant secretary for Health and Human
Services.
   Since 1985, Mrs. James has been public affairs director for the
National Right to Life Committee in Washington. She is also
president of BlackAmericans for Life.
   Her appointment is expected to assuage the concerns of
conservatives who were upset with Bush's selection of Dr. Louis
Sullivan as secretary of Health and Human Services.
   Sullivan had aroused their ire when he indicated a pro-choice
view in an interview. He has since said he shares Bush's position
opposed to abortion except in the case of rape,incest, or
endangerment to the mother's life.

<HEAD>Viking Permits Publication of `Satanic Verses' Excerpts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic
Verses'' agreed Wednesday to allow newspapers to publish up to 750
words of the novel in an attempt to let readers judge the
controversy that has touched off Moslem vows of vengeance against
the author.
   The American Society of Newspaper Editors had suggested that the
publisher, Viking Penguin Inc., make more of the book available for
publication.
   Normally, publishers permit the publication of no more than 300
words from a copyrighted work, usually in a book review.
   But Viking agreed that up to 750 words could be published by
newspapers as long as they give a proper copyright and credit notice
and on the additional condition ``that the material always be put
into proper context as to the overall meaning of the novel,''
according to an announcement by Viking and ASNE.
   The passages were selected by ASNE.
   ASNE President John Seigenthaler, publisher of the Nashville
Tennessean and editorial director of USA Today, said: ``We
approached Viking with the idea that 750 words would give editors an
opportunity to present passages of the book in the space of an op-ed
column. After extensive discussions, they have concurred.''
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the spiritual leader of Iran, said
last month that Rushdie's book insulted Moslems and said Moslems
everywhere should seek out and kill the author for committing
unforgiving sins against the religion.
   Rushdie, a Briton who was born a Moslem, went into hiding, and
Khomeini's action touched off a worldwide reaction. It has been
denounced throughout the West as a threat to freedom of expression
and a violation of the rules of civility.

<HEAD>FDA Balanced Concerns in Fruit Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration's decision to
warn consumers against eating Chilean fruit was a balance of
concerns about the economic impact of such a decision and the health
and safety of Americans, an agency spokesman said Wednesday.
   ``This is a thing of great magnitude,'' said FDA spokesman Don
McLearn.
   ``It has great economic potential,'' he said, but added, ``you
only had two grapes and they weren't sufficient to do that much
harm.''
   However, he continued, ``you had a probable confirmation that it
was a tampering, not a hoax, and then how far do you go with a
decision based on that evidence? That's very tough.''
   The decision was made by FDA Commissioner Frank Young on Monday
and that evening, the agency issued a warning to consumers not to
eat any fruit from Chile and urging stores to remove all Chilean
fruit from their shelves.
   The announcement came some 24 hours after FDA inspectors
discovered two suspicious-looking red grapes that tests later
confirmed to contain traces of cyanide, according to a chronology of
events as outlined by McLearn.
   The saga began March 2 when the U.S. embassy in Santiago received
a call from a Spanish-speaking male who threatened to inject cyanide
into Chile's export fruit. The message was passed on to the U.S.
Customs Service, which put out a cable to its field units, which
began detaining ships with Chilean fruit in U.S. ports.
   A government source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
the caller indicated in his threat that his motive was ``to focus
attention on the lower classes of Chile.''
   The FDA learned of the threat late in the afternoon on March 3,
McLearn said. The following day, a Saturday, Young called together a
group from his regulatory affairs staff, emergency office and the
Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, said McLearn, who
attended the meeting that lasted into the evening.
   Young agreed to continue the detention the Customs Service had
begun throughout the weekend, while he talked to officials at the
State Department, Customs Service, the Chilean ambassador and fruit
importers ``to try to figure out the magnitude of this and grapple
with the decision of what to do,'' the spokesman said.
   But by the end of the weekend, the State Department had concluded
the threat was a hoax, he said.
   ``We felt at that point there was no reason for a full detention
but that we would do surveillance,'' McLearn said. ``At that point
we were prepared to let the fruit through,'' and issued a release
about the hoax.
   A story about the call to the embassy and the determination that
it was a hoax appeared in a Santiago newspaper, and on March 8, the
caller _ ``we assume it was the same guy,'' the FDA spokesman said _
phoned the embassy again and said the threat was not a hoax.
   The FDA heightened its inspections at each of the U.S. ports
where Chilean fruit enters the United States, McLearn said.
   Most of the fruit enters through the port at Philadelphia, and
there the Almeria Star had just arrived with the next major import
from Chile, he said. It was on that ship that inspectors, making a
visual inspection last Sunday, found two grapes that were discolored
and had crystalline rings around puncture marks.
   The grapes were sent to an FDA laboratory in Philadelphia, which
made an initial finding that the grapes contained cyanide. They were
then sent to another FDA lab in Cincinnati, which confirmed traces
of the poison in the grapes, McLearn said.
   The spokesman said did not know when the tests were completed. He
said Young ``made the decision Sunday night that he had to make a
decision and he made the decision Monday,'' though he could not give
a time.
   ``He soul searched and soul searched,'' McLearn said of Young.
   During the night Sunday and on Monday, Young talked to members of
his policy board, including the agency's attorney, trying to
determine a legal and most appropriate action to take, the spokesman
said.
   ``Even though you make a decision that you're going to do
something ... you still have to decide the magnitude of how far you
go. Do you just detain grapes or other fruit also?'' McLearn said.
He also indicated that Young had considered detaining other Chilean
produce as well, but declined to discuss such details of Young's
decision-making.
   Young also considered how much force to put behind his action,
McLearn said. Though the FDA lacked the legal authority t order
stores to withdraw the Chilean imports off the shelves, ``you can
exert pressure,'' he said.
   After the decision was made Monday, Young spent time ``making
sure all the proper bases were touched _ the Public Health Service,
the Department of Health and Human Services, the White House ...
they all had to know,'' McLearn said.

   Here are excerpts from ``The Satanic Verses,''
written by Salman Rushdie, that were released Wednesday for
newspaper publication under an agreement between the publisher,
Viking Penguin Inc., and the American Society of Newspaper Editors.
   The passages were selected by ASNE and are copyrighted by Viking

   The material before the quoted passages is commentary by ASNE.

<TEXT>
   Much of the controversy about ``The Satanic Verses'' relates to
the contention by Moslem groups that the author is questioning the
validity of Muhammad's revelations. In one key passage, a scribe
(whose name, like the author's, is Salman) confides to a pagan poet,
Baal, some details of a dream that has ruined Salman's faith. To
understand the meaning of the dream, the reader needs to identify
other names the scribe refers to: Mahound is the prophet Muhammad,
Gibreel is the Archangel Gabriel, and Shaitan is Satan.
   The following is an excerpt from the passage that appears on
pages 367 and 368 of ``The Satanic Verses'':
   ``One night the Persian scribe had a dream in which he was
hovering above the figure of Mahound at the Prophet's cave on Mount
Cone. At first Salman took this to be no more than a nostalgic
reverie of the old days in Jahilia, but then it struck him that his
point of view, in the dream, had been that of the archangel, and at
that moment the memory of the incident of the Satanic verses came
back to him as vividly as if the thing had happened the previous
day. `Maybe I hadn't dreamed of myself as Gibreel,' Salman
recounted. `Maybe I was Shaitan.' The realization of this
possibility gave him his diabolic idea. After that, when he sat at
the Prophet's feet, writing down rules rules rules, he began,
surreptitiously, to change things.
   ```Little things at first. If Mahound recited a verse in which
God was described as all-hearing, all-knowing, I would write,
all-knowing, all-wise. Here's the point: Mahound did not notice the
alterations. So there I was, actually writing the Book, or
rewriting, anyway, polluting the word of God with my own profane
language. But, good heavens, if my poor words could not be
distinguished from the Revelation by God's own Messenger, then what
did that mean? What did that say about the divine quality of the
divine poetry? Look, I swear, I was shaken to my soul. It's one
thing to be a smart bastard and have half-suspicions about funny
business, but it's quite another thing to find out that you're
right. Listen: I changed my life for that man. I left my country,
crossed the world, settled among people who thought me a slimy
foreign coward for saving their, who never appreciated what I, but
never mind that. The truth is that what I expected when I made that
first tiny change, all-wise instead of all-hearing _ what I wanted _
was to read it back to the Prophet, and he's say, What's the matter
with you, Salman, are you going deaf? And I'd say, Oops, O God, bit
of a slip, how could I, and correct myself. But it didn't happen;
and now I was writing the Revelation and nobody was noticing, and I
didn't have the courage to own up. I was scared silly, I cam tell
you: Also: I was sadder than I have ever been. So I had to go on
doing it. Maybe he's just missed out once, I thought, anybody can
make a mistake. So the next time I changed a bigger thing. He said
Christian, I wrote down Jew. He'd notice that, surely; how could he
not? But when I read him the chapter he nodded and thanked me
politely, and I went out of his tent with tears in my eyes...'''

<TEXT>
   In earlier passages Salman, again talking to Baal about the
dream, tells how he came to the conclusions that made him question
his faith. Here are two excerpts from pages 363 and 364:
   ``The faithful lived by lawlessness, but in those years Mahound _
or should one say the Archangel Gibreel? _ should one say Al-Leh?
became obsessed by law. Amid the palm-trees of the oasis Gibreel
appeared to the Prophet and found himself spouting rules, rules,
rules, until the faithful could scarcely bear the prospect of any
more revelation, Salman said, rules about every damn thing, if a man
farts let him turn his face to the wind, a rule about which hand to
use for the purpose of cleaning one's behind. It was as if no aspect
of human existence was to be left unregulated, free. The revelation
_ the recitation _ told the faithful how much to eat, how deeply
they should sleep, and which sexual positions had received divine
sanction, so that they learned that sodomy and the missionary
position were approved of by the archangel, whereas the forbidden
postures included all those in which the female was on top. Gibreel
further listed the permitted and forbidden subjects of conversation,
and earmarked the parts of the body which could not be scratched no
matter how unbearably they might itch. He vetoed the consumption of
prawns, those bizarre other-worldly creatures which no member of the
faithful had ever seen ...''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   And the other passage:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   ``And Gibreel the archangel specified the manner in which a man
should be buried, and how his property should be divided, so that
Salman the Persian got to wondering what manner of God this was that
sounded so much like a businessman. This was when he had the idea
that destroyed his faith, because he recalled that of course Mahound
himself had been a businessman, and a damned successful one at that,
a person to whom organization and rules came naturally, so how
excessively convenient it was that he should have come up with such
a very businesslike archangel, who handed down the management
decisions of this highly corporate, if non-corporeal, God.''

   The new spiritual leader of millions of
Soviet Moslems said Wednesday that followers of Islam should show
restraint about ``The Satanic Verses,'' the allegedly blasphemous
novel by Salman Rushdie.
   The 36-year-old mufti said Rushdie should be judged in a forum
where he can defend himself.
   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pronounced a death sentence on the
Indian-born British author Feb. 14 and Iranian clerics offered a
$5.2 million reward. Rushdie has been in hiding since.
   Mahammadsadyk Mamayusupov said in an interview, the day after
being chosen to lead the Moslems of Central Asia: ``First, in my
opinion, it is necessary to pass judgment, and after a judgment is
made to announce a reprimand. This is not so simple in Rushdie's
absence.''
   He said Moslems of the Soviet Union ``are also displeased that
Rushdie published a novel in which Islam was insulted,'' but added:
``I don't know who Rushdie is. I don't know in what circumstances he
was writing. Therefore, I can't judge him.''
   If Rushdie is a Moslem, he should be judged by other Moslems,
Mamayusupov said, but if the novelist is not a Moslem a different
forum must be found. He did not say what other kind of forum would
be appropriate.
   Rushdie, 41, was born to Moslem parents in Bombay, India, but has
said he no longer practices religion.
   Among elements of his novel Moslems find objectionable are a
scene in which prostitutes take the names of Mohammed's wives and
the suggestion that the prophet wrote the holy Koran rather than
receiving it fromn Allah.
   About 50 million Moslems live in the Soviet Union, the vast
majority in the Central Asian republics near Iran, Afghanistan and
China.
   Mamayusupov is rector of the Higher Islamic Institute in
Tashkent. Both supporters and opponents consider him a strong and
energetic leader, but those who reject government control of
religion fear he will cooperate too closely with authorities.
   He replaced Shamsuddinkhan Babakhan, who was forced to resign in
February because of charges that he was corrupt and lacked religious
knowledge. Babakhan was the third in a hereditary line of muftis
established in the 1940s.
   Soon after Mamayusupov was chosen Tuesday, several thousand
Moslems shouting ``God is great!'' carried the 7th century Koran of
Caliph Osman to the Islamic Institute. The holy book was being
returned to religious authorities by the officially atheist Soviet
government, which had kept it in a museum.
   Mamayusupov, dressed in a white turban and simple grey coat, said
Wednesday the events reflected increased religious feeling among
Soviet Moslems. He gave credit to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
more liberal policies.
   The change in Soviet society ``has reached Moslems as well,'' he
said. ``They have started to feel freer. They can express their
emotions and actively take part in the social life of the country.''
   Religion is tightly controlled in the Soviet Union, and
dissidents of all faiths criticize officially sanctioned religious
authorities for submitting to state domination.
   Some Moslems privately favor an Iranian-style Islamic republic in
Soviet Central Asia. They say Iran's experience and the success of
Moslem insurgents against Soviet soldiers in Afghanistan have made
some Soviet Moslems more radical.
   That is a serious worry for Soviet authorities, who already have
ethnic troubles in the Caucasus region and the Baltic republics. The
population of Central Asia is growing rapidly and a campaign for
greater autonomy or outright independence based in religion could be
difficult to control.
   The new mufti rejected the possibility of a strong radical
movement reaching Soviet Moslems from Iran or Afghanistan.
   ``We have our own history,'' he said. ``We have deep roots in
Islam. We have our own view and our own foundation. We can influence
others, but others cannot influence us.''
   He is pressing the government for construction of new mosques and
publication of more religious literature.
   ``We will continue to open mosques until all the requests of our
Moslems are satisfied,'' he said. ``There is an agreement on that
between us and the government.''
   Religious and civil authorities have agreed to open almost 40 new
mosques in the five Central Asian republics, which now have about
200, Mamayusupov said.

<TEXT>
   President Reagan in 1985 not only approved a
secret pact to give Honduras more than $110 million for helping the
Nicaraguan Contras but he also telephoned Honduras' president when
the Honduran military delayed an ammunition shipment to the rebels,
the Oliver North jury was told Wednesday.
   Reagan made a note of his call to Roberto Suazo that said the
Honduran ``will call his military commander to tell him to deliver
the ammunition,'' former national security adviser Robert McFarlane
testified at the Oliver North trial. The ammunition then got to the
guerrillas.
   Under questioning by defense lawyers, McFarlane detailed how
Reagan initialed a plan in mid-February 1985 that resulted in
Honduras getting speeded-up deliveries of rifles, ammunition and
machines.
   It was a ``quid pro quo'' arrangement that Reagan was advised
would ``provide incentives'' to the Hondurans for helping out.
   ``You're going to give them tens of millions of dollars to
cooperate?'' North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked McFarlane.
   ``Yes,'' the witness said.
   ``There is nothing dirty about quid pro quo, is there?''
   ``No.''
   Later, reading from a previously secret memo, Sullivan referred
to ``$75 million in economic assistance.'' He also referred to $35
million in expedited militarty aid.
   The matter was so sensitive, McFarlane acknowledged under
questioning, that the arrangement was discussed verbally by the U.S.
ambassador in Honduras with Suazo and was not given to him in
writing.
   North's lawyers say the Reagan administration had a policy of
hiding such arrangements with other countries to support the Contras
during a two-year period in which the so-called the Boland Amendment
prohibited U.S. military aid to the guerrillas.
   Wednesday was McFarlane's fourth day on the witness stand and he
was admonished frequently by the judge to rely on his own memory,
rather than parroting documents that were shown to him to
``refresh'' his often vague recollection. His lawyer said afterward
that the witness had not seen some of those papers since they were
created in 1984 and 1985.
   McFarlane, who was North's boss at the National Security Council
until December 1985, will return Thursday for more cross-examination.
   Sullivan brought out that on May 29, 1987, testifying on Capitol
Hill long after details of the American dealings with Honduras had
become public, McFarlane clung to his story that no one in the U.S.
government had contacted Central American leaders to aid the Contras.
   ``Obviously we have embassies in all these countries,'' he said
then. ``I don't know of any direction from Washington to those
embassies to seek out aid to the Contras.''
   Asked Wednesday whether he regarded the arrangement with Honduras
acceptable in light of the Boland restrictions, McFarlane replied
that ``the president took that (action).''
   Sullivan: The amendment states that people involved in the
intelligence communities cannot assist the Contras.
   McFarlane: It didn't seem to me that he was in any way a member
of the intelligence community.
   Five of the criminal charges against North, the former National
Security Council aide, are that he made false statements and
obstructed Congress in 1985 and 1986 with regard to his activities
on behalf of the Contras.
   McFarlane had told the National Security Council staff, including
North, that the congressional amendment applied to the NSC.
   ``The president of the United States had a much more different
view of the Boland Amendment than you do?'' Sullivan asked.
   When McFarlane answered yes, Sullivan pressed: ``A much more
liberal view?''
   ``We were pretty close.''
   In a recent question-and-answer session with North prosecutors,
the former president maintained, as he had all along, that he relied
on a 1985 legal opinion that ``concluded that the Boland Amendment
did not apply to the actions of the NSC staff.''
   North has insisted he always acted with superiors' authority and
the questioning was an effort to show the wide knowledge among top
officials of his efforts in behalf of the Contras.
   Reagan initialed his approval of the Honduran plan on Feb. 18,
1985. On April 25, according to the testimony, McFarlane recommended
that Reagan phone Suazo because ``the Honduran military this morning
stopped a shipment of ammunition'' and that it ``must continue if
the resistance is to survive.''
   That day, Reagan wrote on the bottom of the memo that Suazo
``expressed his respect for me. He believes we must continue to
oppose communism. He will call his military commander and tell him
to deliver the ammunition.''
   At the time of the quid pro quo arrangements, Honduras was
harboring many of the Contras in camps along the country's southern
border, and Honduran officials feared Sandinista troops might come
across the border from Nicaragua.
   There was a temporary halt in the trial as North's lawyers tried
to introduce classified material while cross-examining McFarlane.
   Gesell said he will rule on a piecemeal basis in connection with
the information North's attorneys want to present in cross-examining
McFarlane, rather in advance as requested by chief trial prosecutor
John Keker.
   He also permitted North's lawyers to introduce the names of
Central American countries and Central American officials in
documents that spell out quid pro quo arrangements with Honduras and
other countries.

   Experts said Wednesday the Bush
administration's ban on imports of semiautomatic rifles would have
scant impact on crime since so many of those weapons already are in
circulation and more are being manufactured domestically.
   ``The lifting of the import permits ... will reduce the supply of
assault weapons to gun dealers in the country,'' said Cheryl Epps,
legislative anaylst for the International Association of Chiefs of
Police, but ``many assault weapons are manufactured domestically.''
   The suspension won't have any effect on crime ``because the flow
of weapons will remain the same if domestic manufacturers fill the
void,'' she said.
   However, the growth of the domestic arsenal promised to take a
decline, too, with an announcement by Colt Industries Inc on
Wednesday that it was voluntarily suspending sales of its
domestically produced AR15 semiautomatic assault-style rifles.
   Colt would not say how many of the weapons it makes.
   ``If it is determined by the government review that semiautomatic
rifles are not appropriate for the commercial market, we will not
sell the AR15 in that market,'' said Colt spokesman Mike Dunn.
   Bush administration drug director William J. Bennett welcomed
Colt's decision as ``an act of civic responsibility.''
   On Tuesday, Bennett announced the suspension of pending import
permits for more than 110,000 semiautomatic rifles, referred to as
``assault-style'' because they look like machine guns.
   The White House stressed Wednesday that there were no plans to
curtail sales of similar rifles produced domestically.
   Gwynne Peirson, retired professor of criminology at Howard
University and a police officer for 23 years in Oakland, Calif.,
said the ban on imports will have no immediate impact, but
ultimately could if it is made permanent.
   ``I think the ban on imports will have a definite positive
effect, but it will have to trickle down and we may not even see the
impact next year,'' he said.
   ``So many of them have been brought in in the recent past, that
they will still be in the market,'' he said. ``The only thing the
ban will do in the short run is to increase the price of the
available weapons.''
   Gregg Risch of Handgun Control, one of the country's leading gun
control advocates, said the organization is ``thrilled'' by the
administration's action, but was even harsher than Peirson in his
assessment of the possible impact on crime, saying simply: ``Zero.''
   ``There are a couple of million of them already out on the
streets, gun stores already have large stocks of ones already
imported and domestically made ones, and yesterday's action doesn't
do anything to stop them from selling those,'' Risch said.
   ``We're not saying it will have a tremendous effect on crime,''
said one Treasury Department official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``But in three to four years, we would have 1 million of
those guns here.''
   The Colt AR15, the semiautomatic version of the military's M-16
rifle, is the most similar domestically made weapon to those whose
imports have been suspended, such as semiautomatic versions of
AK-47s and Uzi carbines, according to Dick Pedersen of the Treasury
Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
   The suspension on imports does not affect thousands of other
semiautomatic rifles awaiting import permits, Pedersen said.
   ``Hunting rifles that are semiautomatic do not look like
automatic weapons,'' he said. ``The ones that don't look like
automatic weapons are still coming in.''
   According to estimates by the National Rifle Association and gun
control activists, there are 60 million to 70 million firearms in
private hands in the United States, including 20 million to 30
million semiautomatic weapons ranging from pistols to the
assault-style rifles.
   But it is unclear exactly how many semiautomatic rifles,
including assault-style weapons, are produced in the United States,
Pedersen said.
   In 1987, the United States produced a total of 1.76 million
handguns and 1.01 million rifles, including regular bolt and pump
action armaments as well as semiautomatics, Pedersen said. That was
a 300,000 jump in both categories _ handguns and rifles _ from the
previous year, and the number was expected to have increased in 1988.
   The NRA, which opposes limits on weapons other than machine-guns
that already are banned, maintains that only cosmetic differences
exist between those whose imports have been suspended and the rest,
including weapons ``that have been around for a century.''

<HEAD>Booster Joint Heater Failed Before Discovery Launch, NASA Official
Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OGDEN, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A joint heater on one of Morton Thiokol's two
booster rockets failed hours before the Monday launch of the space
shuttle Discovery, but a backup heater worked, a NASA official said
Wednesday.
   Royce Mitchell, manager of Thiokol's shuttle motor program for
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he learned
of cooling, indicating heater failure in the aft field joint of the
right booster, about midnight before the launch.
   ``It had all the appearances of a high-current short,'' Mitchell
said in a telephone interview from Huntsville, Ala. The cause of the
electrical surge was unknown Wednesday.
   The short apparently either damaged the heater itself or wiring,
Mitchell said. A backup heater was turned on.
   Overall, he said, officials were pleased with the performance of
the boosters.
   Flight data and a look at the motors, which were retrieved
Tuesday from the Atlantic Ocean, showed they performed well and did
not have any cork insulation loss like that suspected of damaging
orbiters on the previous two shuttle flights.
   ``They were certainly right down the line,'' Mitchell said.
   The boosters burned just 1.4 seconds longer than predicted during
the two minutes the boosters are used.
   ``We're very pleased with that kind of performance,'' Mitchell
said.
   ``We did not compromise any safety figures,'' Mitchell said of
the decision to proceed with launch. ``We had played this `What if?'
game'' before in tests of such an occurrence.
   On Dec. 8, a heater shorted on a booster being prepared for test
firing at Thiokol's Wasatch Operations plant west of Brigham City.
   The heaters, part of a redesign of the motors prompted by
destruction of the shuttle Challenger in 1986, maintain resiliency
of O-ring seals in the three field joints of each motor. Each heater
has a backup.
   External inspection of the motors after their return to land
Tuesday showed no evidence of hot exhaust gases escaping the seals,
Mitchell said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Solution to Soviet Food Problem Years Away</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: LEADS throughout, UPDATING with details on Gorbachev speech.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said Wednesday that
all Soviet farmers should be permitted to lease their land and
decide what to plant in a new national program to ease chronic food
shortages. But he said it will be years before the country can feed
itself.
   Gorbachev called food shortages ``our society's biggest wound.''
Meat, sugar and many other foodstuffs must be rationed in numerous
Soviet regions.
   In a tacit acknowledgement that one of his earlier attempts to
rejuvenate Soviet agriculture had failed, Gorbachev proposed
abolishing a government superagency created in 1985 to oversee the
country's farm sector.
   The Communist Party's policy-making Central Committee, convened
by party General Secretary Gorbachev, began a two-day meeting
Wednesday largely devoted to agricultural reform. It will look for
ways to increase the food supply and improve traditionally dreary
rural life.
   Gorbachev asked the committee to approve ``an agrarian policy
that will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the land,
and dependably solve the food problem.''
   ``Further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible,'' he said.
   The 58-year-old Kremlin leader, the former party overseer for
agriculture and the son of a southern Russian peasant, said
conditions in some rural regions were at a ``critical level,'' with
mass migration of their populations to cities.
   He said farm productivity is so low the Soviet Union must go
abroad to buy ``large quantities of grain, meat, fruits, vegetables,
sugar, vegetable oil and some other staples'' to meet demand at home.
   Losses of grain due to inefficiency total 40 million metric tons
_ equal to Soviet grain purchases abroad, Gorbachev said. He
endorsed focusing on making Soviet farming and food processing work
better, rather than on increasing the area under cultivation.
   In 1988, gross Soviet farm output rose only 0.7 percent, and the
grain harvest was only 195 million metric tons, 16 million below the
annual average achieved in 1986-87, according to Washington,
D.C.-based PlanEcon Inc., which studies Soviet economic performance.
   Gorbachev said the ruling Politburo would ask the 300-member
Central Committee for ``extensive transition to leasing,'' or
allowing work collectives and individuals to work state-owned
farmland in exchange for a fee.
   Western analysts say leasing benefits would be largely annulled
if Moscow-based bureaucrats retain the right to dictate which crops
should be planted on individual plots and in which quantities, but
Gorbachev said lease-holders should be given a virtual free hand.
   ``Let us not fix assignments, let us not set deadlines,''
Gorbachev said. Gorbachev, who first proposed leasing last June,
said ``all units of the farm'' should work on the lease principle.
He has said leasing guarantees higher production because
lease-holders can earn more if they work harder, rather than getting
a fixed salary regardless of output as has been traditional on
Soviet state and collective farms.
   Gorbachev said ``more flexible prices'' for crops purchased by
the state would go into effect next Jan. 1, and the number of
products for which prices are fixed by bureaucrats would be reduced.
   He reassured Soviet consumers prices will stay the same for the
next ``two or three years'' for bread, flour, cereals, meat, fish,
eggs, milk, sugar, butter, vegetable oils and baby foods, despite
the admitted pressing need for price reform to curtail state
subsidies.
   One proposal calls for abolishment of the State Agro-Industrial
Committee, created in November 1985, eight months after Gorbachev
was named Soviet leader.
   He said the giant agency would be replaced by a commission of the
Council of Ministers, or Soviet cabinet.
   While calling for urgent measures to improve the Soviet diet,
Gorbachev said a definite end to food shortages could not be
expected until the middle of next decade.
   Gorbachev's one-hour, 45-minute speech on agriculture was later
shown on state-run television.
   The Central Committee earlier moved to formally elect its top
leaders and other representatives, including Gorbachev, to the
nation's new parliament.
   The Communist Party is one of 30 organizations with the power to
choose one-third of the 2,250 representatives in the new Congress of
People's Deputies.
   Despite publicity touting this campaign as the Soviet Union's
first election with competing candidates, the party chose to
nominate just 100 persons for its 100 seats. Party members had
suggested more than 31,000 names.
   The food problem is likely to produce far more discussion at the
Central Committee plenum, since the party's conservative agriculture
chief, Yegor K. Ligachev, apparently disagrees with Gorbachev on a
solution.
   Ligachev has said little about Gorbachev's call for leasing,
instead emphasizing collective farming _ the system that has left
Soviets standing in line for meat and vegetables.
   Gorbachev said Wednesday increased investment to modernize
collective farms was not enough, that huge capital investments in
agriculture in recent years ``failed to yield equally substantial
results.''
   No one, however, proposed letting farmers own outright the land
they till, or the breakup of the giant collective and state farms
that have been the backbone of the Soviet agricultural system since
the days of Josef V. Stalin.
   Gorbachev said such farms can work with the right management
techniques.
   Living standards in the Soviet countryside are far lower than in
cities. Gorbachev said drastic improvements were needed.
   Tass said the Central Committee would reconvene Thursday to
discuss Gorbachev's report on agriculture.

   President Daniel Ortega said Wednesday
his leftist government will allow a Roman Catholic church radio news
program to resume and will let 10 expelled priests return to
Nicaragua.
   ``We are trying to create a better climate in our country that
strengthens the tendency towards total and definitive peace that the
Nicaraguan people demand,'' Ortega said after meeting with Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo, head of the Nicaraguan church.
   In neighboring Honduras, President Jose Azcona Hoyo said his
government was working on a plan to demobilize thousands of
Nicaraguan rebels in camps near the border, and he denied reports
that the United States has asked the government to let them stay
another year.
   ``Honduras is interested in demobilizing the Contras because
their departure from our territory is in the benefit of national
security,'' he told reporters.
   Azcona Hoyo and the four other Central American presidents agreed
last month to repatriate the rebels or move them to third countries.
Nicaragua said it would move up elections scheduled for November
1990 and take other steps toward greater democracy.
   Ortega said Wednesday that Radio Catolica's ``Iglesia'' news
program, shut down by the Sandinista government July 11, would be
allowed to resume immediately.
   In addition to the shutdown, the leftist government in July
expelled U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S.
diplomats from Nicaragua, arrested at least 40 people at a major
opposition demonstration and closed the opposition newspaper La
Prensa for 15 days.
   Ortega announced the government would allow 10 priests to return
to Nicaragua and would review a list of other priests barred from
the country to determine whether they could return.
   The Sandinistas expelled the 10 priests between 1982 and 1985 for
allegedly plotting against the government.
   Those priests eligible to return to Nicaragua are: Francisco
Castelli, Vicente Caudeli, Francisco San Martin, Santiago de Anitua
and Luis Corrales of Spain; Vicente Huerta, Jose Montero and Jose
Maria Pacheco of Costa Rica; Mario Fiandri of Italy; and Mario
Madriz of Panama.
   Monsignor Bismarck Carballo, director of Radio Catolica, told The
Associated Press Wednesday the government might grant entry to five
more priests it had expelled. Carballo did not identify the priests.
   Obando y Bravo told Ortega that a government amnesty should be
extended to all jailed members of the former National Guard and
political prisoners, Ortega said.
   The National Assembly on Tuesday approved amnesty for 1,894
former guardsmen, most of whom had been jailed since the 1979
revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power.
   The assembly refused to grant an amnesty for 39 former guardsmen
who, it said, had committed ``atrocious crimes'' against the
Nicaraguan people.
   The New York Times reported Tuesday that Robert M. Kimmit, U.S.
undersecretary of state for political affairs, formally asked
Honduras on Monday to let the Contras stay for another year.
   But Azcona said Wednesday, ``We only talked about humanitarian
aid for the Contras.''
   Ortega said Wednesday that more U.S. humanitarian aid for the
rebels would violate the Central American peace plan. Only aid
designed to dismantle the guerrilla army is acceptable under the
regional accords, he said.
   Government sources in Washington and rebel leaders have said the
Bush administration plans to ask for a 12-month humanitarian aid
package for the rebels that totals between $40 million and $50
million.
   ``This runs against the accords we Central American presidents
signed in El Salvador, and we cannot let it pass peacefully,''
Ortega said of the reported aid request. He spoke with reporters
after a meeting with Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   Ortega and the presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala and
Costa Rica agreed at the Feb. 13-14 summit to draft a plan to
demobilize the Contras, about 11,000 of whom are in base camps in
Honduras.
   In turn, Ortega pledged to institute democratic reforms in
Nicaragua and move up general elections by 10 months, to February
1990.
   A $27 million package of rebel humanitarian assistance approved
by Congress last year runs out at the end of March.
   The United States has supported the Contras since 1981 in their
war to oust the leftist Sandinista government. The Contras fled to
Honduras after U.S. military assistance expired in February 1988.
   The Sandinistas and Contras signed a provisional cease-fire pact
in March 1988 that has been unilaterally extended on a monthly basis
by the government. The Contras have tacitly accepted the extensions,
but talks on a permanent cease-fire have stalled.

   Here are excerpts of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech Wednesday to a Communist Party Central Committee
meeting, whose purpose he described as developing ``an agrarian
policy that will be able to restore the peasant as the master on the
land and dependably resolve the food problem.''
   They were taken from the English-language translation by the
official news agency Tass.
   _On the overall problem:
   Further delay in this matter is simply inadmissible.
   Drastic changes in the countryside are an essential prerequisite
for the country's economic and social progress. ... We all remember
the concern expressed by delegates to the 19th national party
conference when discussing the food supply situation in the country.
We described this problem as `our society's biggest wound.'
   The state has to buy large quantities of grain, meat, fruit,
vegetables, sugar, vegetable oil and some other staples abroad. We
are still behind developed countries, big and small, in labor
efficiency, yield capacity and livestock productivity and in the
diversity and quality of foodstuffs. The gap is widening rather than
narrowing. The shortage of food creates social tension and generates
not merely criticism, but actual discontent.
   Huge capital and other investments have been made in agriculture
in recent years, but the inputs have failed to yield equally
substantial results.''
   Comrades, we should work out an agrarian policy that would enable
us to blunt the sharp edge of the food problem in the immediate
future and to grow enough farm produce, in terms of both amount and
choice, to stabilize food supplies in the 13th Five-Year Plan
(1991-96).
   In the 13th five-year period, it is planned to increase the
output of foodstuffs by 26 percent to 30 percent, while the output
of farm produce will grow by 16 percent.
   _On Stalin's brutal collectivization of agriculture:
   In the process of combatting the kulaks, violence was inflicted
upon the huge mass of middle-strata peasants and even poor ones.
Millions of peasants, together with their families, were torn away
from their land plots and native areas and suffered misfortunes,
often dying in camps and exile.
   _On leasing:
   Let us not fix assignments, let us not set deadlines. The point
at issue is the transfer of land and other means of production to
lease-holders, their real control over those means. ...
   If the plenum backs the relevant proposals of the Politburo, the
Presidium of the USSR Supreme Soviet and the government, and we
adopt corresponding documents, this will create legal and economic
prerequisites for an extensive transition to leasing.
   _On price reform:
   The purposes of economic restructuring cannot be achieved, new
methods of economic management cannot be introduced and a socialist
market cannot be formed without a price reform. ... Purchase prices
of some kinds of quality products are so low as not to stimulate the
development and rational distribution of specialized highly
marketable production.
   The documents circulated among you envisage the introduction of
new purchase prices of farm produce as of Jan. 1, 1990. ... The
range of products priced in a centralized way should be reduced.
   _On banks:
   There is a need for radical restructuring of the activity of
banks, particularly of the agro-industrial bank. It is necessary to
ensure that they are really interested in the development of
production and act as business partners.
   _On the independence of agricultural enterprises:
   Agricultural enterprises are really doubly dependent. On the one
hand, they are subordinated to higher bodies along the departmental
line. They are also managed in no less, perhaps even in a greater
degree, by local party and government bodies, starting from the
district level.
   Perestroika presupposes a radical change in the system of
managing the agrarian sector at all levels. ... We proceeded from
the assumption that no one should interfere in the day-to-day
economic activities of collective and state farms, and still less
with peasant and individual small holdings.
   _On equipment problems in agriculture:
   Workers of the agrarian sector rightly complain that the
machine-makers, abusing their monopoly status, often foist upon them
outdated models of expensive machines with low dependability and
efficiency standards. This is ruinous not only for agriculture, but
for the country as a whole.
   We produce more tractors than any other country in the world, and
yet complaints about their short supply are common. ...
Machine-makers should be put in such economic conditions that would
rule out the manufacture of shoddy equipment.
   _On waste in agriculture:
   Our losses in grain harvesting and pre-storage treatment amount
to 15 million and even 20 million tons. About as much is lost in
storage and processing. In all, comrades, the losses equal our
purchases abroad.
   Due to the sparsity of meat packing plants, their low
technological standards, and inefficient use of raw material, meat
losses, even according to the lowest estimates, add up to around 1
million tons. This despite the acute shortage of foodstuffs. Such is
the dimension of the problem.
   Many problems stem from the methods of economic management,
people's attitude to work and their poor motivation to achieve
better end results.
   _On ecology:
   What must be done as a matter of urgency is putting reclaimed
lands in proper order and taking measures to put land and water to
more rational use. Efforts to come to grips with ecological problems
that have piled up should not be put off either.
   We should drastically raise standards and increase accountablity
when it comes to the production, transportation and storage of
chemicals and especially their application to the soil.
   _On life in the villages:
   The peasant mode of life has lost its attractiveness and
prestige. People, above all the young, are leaving villages.
   The disregard for the needs of villages and the hypertrophied
urban development brought about great social distortions and
complicated the normal economic functioning of whole regions.
   The rates of house building in villages in the 13th five-year
period must at least be doubled.
   Villagers justly raise the issue why rural areas have been put on
`short rations' and why peasants have been left to struggle with
their problems alone, although the country has vast resources.

   Those who knew him and the global works of
his construction dynasty took stock on Wednesday of the energetic
life of master-builder Stephen Bechtel Sr.
   ``This guy was a builder,'' said former San Francisco Mayor
Joseph Alioto. ``This was a guy who moved the Earth.''
   Bechtel, 88, died Tuesday in Merritt Peralta Medical Center in
Oakland after a brief illness.
   From the construction business his father built out of the ashes
of San Francisco's earthquake of 1906, Bechtel created one of the
world's largest engineering and construction firms, the privately
held Bechtel Group Inc.
   The company built Hoover Dam, pipelines, mines, whole seaports
and harbors, scores of hotels, towering buildings and transportation
systems on seven continents. Among its projects still under
construction is Jubail, an entire Saudi Arabian city of 250,000.
   In World War II, a Bechtel project turned out 560 ships for the
Navy.
   Fortune Magazine called him ``the boldest and maybe the biggest
builder in the world.''
   He retired as board chairman in 1965 but continued as senior
director and roving ambassador for the company. He never completely
retired.
   ``My father was a remarkable man,'' said Stephen Bechtel Jr., who
took over as chairman of Bechtel Group Inc. ``He was also the best
of fathers.''
   Born in Aurora, Ind., in 1900, Stephen Davison Bechtel was a
world business leader who knew presidents, prime ministers and kings
on a first-name basis.
   Bechtel in 1949 overheard an oil company executive remark that a
pipeline from Alberta, Canada, across the Rockies to the Pacific was
a great idea. Bechtel sketched out the plan on the tablecloth.
   A few years later, 80,000 barrels of oil flowed through the
718-mile Canadian Trans-Mountain Pipeline. It was called one of the
most remarkable pipeline engineering feats in history.
   Bechtel managed construction of the four-county Bay Area Rapid
Transit system, and the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which
Bechtel commuted over from his Oakland home every working day.
   Despite the crush of bridge traffic, which sets most motorists
griping, Bechtel thought it was quite a nice thing to do every day
on the way to his 32nd-floor office in the company's San Francisco
headquarters.
   ``It's a very pleasant ride, and traffic isn't that bad'' he told
a reporter in a rare interview.
   Bechtel was one of the University of California at Berkeley's
most successful dropouts. In a hurry to get on with his vision, he
quit college in 1920, but the university named him Alumnus of the
Year in 1952.
   Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman hailed Bechtel's ``loyalty
and generosity'' to the university, particularly in establishing a
$6.3 million engineering center.
   Bechtel leaves his widow, Laura, and their two children, Stephen
and Barbara Bechtel Davies. Funeral services were private.

   A convicted cop-killer awarded clemency by
Gov. Mario Cuomo in 1985 won parole Wednesday, in a case that has
fed the controversy over efforts to restore the death penalty in the
state.
   Gary McGivern, 44, could leave the medium-security prison here by
the end of the week, parole board officials said. He was convicted
13{ years ago in the 1968 shooting death of William Fitzgerald.
   Michael Kavanagh, who prosecuted McGivern and co-defendant
Charles Culhane, said the parole board's decision was ``a real
tragedy'' and ``a sad commentary on our criminal justive system.''
   McGivern had twice previously been denied parole.
   Some law enforcement officials who critisized McGivern's parole
said it might nudge state legislators who are considering whether to
override a Cuomo veto of legislation to restore New York's death
penalty.
   ``That's just wishful thinking,'' Cuomo said at a news
conference. ``Advocates of the death penalty will tell you that a
leaf that fell from the tree was a sign.''
   The state's electric chair hasn't been used since 1963; Cuomo has
successfully vetoed death penalty legislation for the past six years.
   While McGivern was viewed by many as an unrepentant cop-killer,
he had some well-known and vocal supporters, including folk singer
Pete Seeger, conservative columnist William F. Buckley and civil
rights lawyer William Kunstler.
   ``It's been a long haul. I've been in this for 13{ years,'' said
Kuntsler. ``I'm happy for Gary, his wife and his family.''
   Through three trials, McGivern and Culhane have steadfastly
maintained their innocence in the death of Fitzgerald, a Westchester
County deputy.
   Fitzgerald was shot during an escape attempt by McGivern, Culhane
and a third inmate, Robert Bowerman, who were being driven to a
court date by Fitzgerald and another officer.
   At the time, McGivern and Culhane were serving sentences for
robbing a gas station together. They claimed Bowerman acted alone;
Kavanagh said McGivern fired the shot that killed Fitzerald.
   McGivern wasn't granting interviews Wednesday, but Culhane said
``that's wonderful'' when told the news.
   ``It's about time. He'll do good out there,'' said Culhane, an
award-winning prison poet and dramatist.
   Culhane was not eligible for a parole hearing until late 1991.
   The parole board said it was releasing McGivern for good conduct.
   ``It was felt that Mr. McGivern could live and remain at liberty
without violating the law,'' said an statement read by Edward Elwin,
the board's executive director.
   McGivern plans to live with Marguerite Culp, a former newspaper
reporter who met McGivern in prison and married him in a prison-yard
ceremony a decade ago, Elwin said.
   McGivern and Culhane's first trial ended in a hung jury. Their
second ended with death sentences, but those convictions were
overturned. The two were convicted after a third trial in 1975.
   ``It was a very difficult call,'' Cuomo said of his clemency
ruling. ``This man is not a cop killer.''
   Cuomo's action drew criticism from then-Vice President George
Bush.

   Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said
Wednesday she regrets a letter she wrote that has been used by
conservative Republicans in her home state of Arizona to support
their claim that the United States is ``a Christian nation.''
   ``I regret that a letter I sent to an acquaintance in response to
her request for information was used in a political debate,''
O'Connor said in a brief statement. ``It was not my intention to
express a personal view about the subject of the inquiry but merely
to attempt to respond appropriately to one of the many requests for
information which come across my desk.''
   O'Connor declined further comment.
   The letter prompted some harsh criticism of O'Connor by legal
scholars and People for the American Way, a group that promotes
separation of church and state.
   Arthur J. Kropp, president of People for the American Way, wrote
to the justice:
   ``Like many Americans, I was surprised to read about your letter
... suggesting that three Supreme Court decisions have held that the
United States is a `Christian nation.'
   ``The Christian nation movement has emerged in recent years as a
force for religious intolerance. Its effect is to make
non-Christians feel excluded from society and to define `Christians'
on the basis of narrow political views.''
   Bruce Fein, a conservative lawyer who closely follows Supreme
Court developments, said the letter ``creates an ugly image in
having such a sensitive issue treated in such a cavalier way.''
   He said the letter is ``grossly improper'' because O'Connor
``gratuitously intruded herself into the political process.''
   Issues of religious freedom ``are perhaps the most inflammatory
that have ever reached the Supreme Court,'' Fein said. ``Judges must
have not only actual impartiality but the appearance of it.''
   Laurence Tribe, a liberal law school professor at Harvard
University, said in an interview with the Washington Post, ``It is
astonishing for any justice in the late 20th century to treat the
court's references to the religious character of our country as
somehow equivalent ... to the proclamation that this is a Christian
nation.''
   O'Connor's letter, dated May 19, 1988, was sent to Annetta
Conant, author of a resolution characterizing the United States as a
Christian nation that was adopted in January by the Arizona
Republican Party.
   The resolution is a rallying point for backers of former Arizona
Gov. Evan Mecham, a Republican who was removed from office last
year. Moderate Republicans and prominent Jewish Republicans in the
state have expressed dismay over the resolution, which also said the
nation is ``a republic based upon the absolute laws of the Bible,
not a democracy based on the changing whims of people.''
   O'Connor, a former state legislator in Arizona who has been on
the high court since 1981, said in her letter to Ms. Conant, ``You
wrote me recently to inquire about any holdings of this court to the
effect that this a Christian nation. There are statements to such
effect in the following opinions.''
   The letter then cites three high court rulings. In one, handed
down in 1892, the court said, ``We are a Christian people and the
morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity.''
   But two more recent opinions do not refer to the United States as
a Christian nation in the pages cited by O'Connor.
   One opinion, written by the liberal William O. Douglas when he
was a member of the court in 1952, said, ``We are a religious people
whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being. We guarantee the
freedom to worship as one chooses.''
   The other, a concurring opinion written in 1961 by then-Justice
Felix Frankfurter, said ``religious beliefs'' in America ``shall
continue ... to exist, to function ... free of the dictates and
directions of the state.'' Frankfurter was Jewish.
   O'Connor's statement Wednesday did not say whether she actually
did the research or wrote the letter to Ms. Conant.
   But the Supreme Court's public information office said O'Connor's
letter was similar to one written in 1975 by the court's librarian
in response to a request for information by an Oregon woman.

<HEAD>March Winds In Northeast; Thunderstorms In Michigan, Appalachians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Warm March winds whipped across portions of the Northeast on
Wednesday, while powerful thunderstoms lashed Michigan and parts of
the Appalachians.
   Winds gusted to 58 mph at Buffalo and Rochester, N.Y., and
Dubois, Pa., and to 61 mph at Johnstown, Pa. High wind warnings were
in effect for central New York and along the Champlain Valley
bordering New York and Vermont.
   The winds were accompanied by balmy temperatures. But a cold
front swept down from Canada across the Appalachians, bringing
temperatures in the 30s and 40s from the Great Lakes to the Ohio
Valley.
   Very strong thunderstorms, accompanied by some small hail, hit
the mountains of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina.
Thunderstorms in Michigan triggered a fire in a church and pushed
the Rogue River to near flood stage at Rockford.
   More than 16 inches of wet, heavy snow fell at the K.I. Sawyer
Air Force Base, shutting down routine operations at the Lake
Superior post in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.
   However, the stormy weather was fairly short-lived.
   ``This is a typical March storm,'' said meteorologist Fred Keyes
of the National Weather Service bureau in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``You
have all sorts of weather and then it moves out as quickly as it
came. It doesn't hang around like a real winter storm does.''
   In the West, snow fell throughout much of the morning over parts
of central Montana. Snow was occasionally heavy in the Great Falls
area, with up to 2 inches of snow per hour at times.
   Rain was scattered across the Pacific Northwest.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST
included three-quarters of an inch at Astoria, Ore., and six-tenths
of an inch at Chattanooga, Tenn.
   Mild air brought some record high temperatures to the East.
Temperatures warmed into the 50s and 60s over much of New England,
the 70s over the mid-Atlantic coastal states and to the 80s over
portions of the Carolinas.
   The temperature hit 83 degrees at Martinsburg, W.V., 62 in
Binghampton, N.Y., 71 in Newark , N.J., and 69 in Williamsport, Pa.
   Some of the dust that was lifted into the air from the central
high plains on Tuesday settled over eastern New Mexico and western
Texas, cutting visibility in places down to one mile.
   Dust also settled in a band from Tennessee across northwest
Alabama, northern Mississippi, southern Arkansas, northern Louisiana
and south-central Texas.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 11
degrees at Marquette, Mich., and Duluth and International Falls,
Minn., to 89 degrees at McCallen and Harlingen, Texas.
   For Thursday, the National Weather Service was predicting rain
along the Pacific Coast from Washington to central California, and
rainshowers scattered across northern portions of the Plateau, with
snow at higher elevations. Light snow was expected from the northern
Rockies across portions of the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin to
upper Michigan. A few flurries were expected in New York State and
northern New England.
   High temperatures were expected in the teens along the Canadian
border from Montana to Minnesota; in the 20s and 30s from the
northern Rockies across the Dakotas, the upper Mississippi Valley
and much of the Great Lakes region to northern New England; and in
the 70s and 80s from the desert Southwest across the southern plains
to the Gulf Coast states. Elsewhere, highs were expected in the 40s,
50s and 60s.

   Authorities evacuated a high school and
briefly closed parts of two interstates Wednesday to protect people
from a cloud of thick orange smoke from burning fertilizer,
officials said.
   There were no reports of injuries, said Deputy Fire Chief Jon
Hansen. Officials said late Wednesday afternoon they expected to
have the fire out by early evening.
   About 60 firefighters contained the blaze at the Douglass High
School football stadium on the east edge of downtown Oklahoma City,
said Fire Department Dispatcher Harvey Weathers.
   The firefighters were keeping their distance from the fire and
were allowing the blaze to burn itself out, Hansen said.
   Wind pushed the orange cloud to the south. Fire officials urged
people south of the stadium to avoid the cloud, and the Oklahoma
Highway Patrol closed sections of Interstates 40 and 35 through the
city for a little more than two hours.
   Jack Isch, in charge of the Oklahoma City school district's
service center, had said recently that the district has stored for
20 years some fertilizer donated to the school.
   The fertilizer at the stadium covers an area about 20 feet wide
and 30 feet long. Isch said he didn't know how many bags are in the
pile.
   The school board voted unanimously last week to hire a firm to
remove the fertilizer, which is ammonium nitrate. The federal
Environmental Protection Agency has said the fertilizer may have a
low level of toxicity.

   The Supreme Court on Wednesday blocked
Thursday's scheduled execution in Arkansas of convicted mass
murderer R. Gene Simmons, who has said he wants to die.
   The justices, without dissent, granted an emergency request made
by another Arkansas death row inmate in Simmons' behalf.
   The request was granted without comment.
   Simmons was scheduled to receive a lethal injection at 7 a.m.
Thursday.
   He would have been the first prisoner executed in Arkansas since
1964.
   Simmons was convicted last month of the 1987 Christmas-time
slaughter of 14 members of his family. He has given up his right to
appeal, saying he wants to die.
   Simmons was convicted in 1988 of the deaths of two Russellville,
Ark., residents on Dec. 28, 1987. After the shooting spree which
left the two dead, Simmons was arrested and lawmen went to his home
near Dover, Ark., and found the bodies of the family members.
   The request to block Simmons' execution was made by death row
inmate Jonas H. Whitmore.
   The Arkansas Supreme Court ruled Whitmore lacked legal standing
to challenge Simmons' execution.
   Whitmore then appealed to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry A.
Blackmun, who referred the matter to the full court.

<HEAD>Czech Writers Meet To Discuss Political Situation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Czech Writers' Union ended a
two-day meeting on Wednesday that was marked by controversy, and
state-run media called for ``differentiated'' treatment of banned
and emigre authors.
   The meeting was the latest in a series of discussions between
intellectuals and Communist Party and government figures following
signs of increasing discontent among the nation's artists.
   Thousands of actors, musicians, writers and cultural workers
recently signed a petition asking authorities for a meaningful
dialogue, more truthful media coverage of urgent political issues,
and the release of playwright-activist Vaclav Havel and other
political prisoners.
   Havel, whose plays were banned in Czechoslovakia after the 1968
Soviet-led invasion crushed ``Prague Spring'' reforms, was jailed in
February for nine months on charges of incitement and obstructing a
police officer.
   The state news agency CTK said speakers at the writers' meeting
``tackled again, from different and sometimes controversial
standpoints, the ... contemporary situation in Czech literature . ..
and also the general context of the political climate.''
   It said that Culture Minister Milan Kymlicka and the recently
elected head of the federal Czechoslovak Writers' Union, Miroslav
Valek, attended the meeting of the Czech Writers' Union. The two
organizations are separate.
   Valek, a Slovak poet, was made head of the Czechoslovak Writers'
Union after resigning late last year as Slovak minister of culture
following an article he wrote urging more reform.
   Czechoslovakia's leaders, installed after the 1968 invasion, have
found it difficult to follow Kremlin reforms. Moscow at one time
asked the leaders to quash many of the same reforms.
   One problem is how to deal now with the hundreds of intellectuals
barred from official cultural life and the 500,000 people expelled
from the party after 1968.
   ``We must not be silent about some controversial names from our
literature, especially from the end of the '60s, we mustn't walk
around the works of these authors as if they didn't exist,'' Michal
Cernik, head of the Czech Writers' Union was quoted as saying by the
Rude Pravo daily on Wednesday.
   Offical historians consider the Czechoslovak Writers' Union as
having spearheaded the short-lived period of reform in 1968.
   Some of the foremost members of the union, such as writer Milan
Kundera, left the country after the 1968 invasion. Others continued
writing in underground publications.
   The meeting also ``dealt with the activities of emigre writers .
.. and recommends evaluating their work and differentiating,'' Rude
Pravo reported.
   ``Our society doesn't renounce any artist, unless he himself
renounces the society and turns his back on it,'' the paper said.

   President Bush, calling Wednesday for
implementation of his plan to lower the capital gains tax, said U.S.
companies ``should not have to run an uphill race against the rest
of the world.''
   In an upbeat speech about the nation's economic future, the
president also said the United States ``stands at a special moment
in our history'' when his economic programs can empower more people
to partake in the American dream.
   Highlighting his proposal to reduce the capital gains tax in the
face of competition from nations that have little or no tax on such
gains, Bush called on Congress to sign on to his plan. He said, ``I
challenge the Congress to join with me and level that playing
field.''
   ``America's entrepreneurs should not have to run an uphill race
against the rest of the world,'' he said speaking to a gala dinner
of the Electronic Industries Association.
   Bush estimates the capital gains cut would add $4.8 billion in
revenue for the 1990 fiscal year, money which he said can be used
``to expand economic freedom, and help people help themselves.''
   ``Yes, America faces immediate problems _ problems like ocean
dumping, the homeless, illiteracy,'' Bush said in the speech.
   But said he intends to address those problems, but added, ``Let
us move beyond the immediate. For today, America is prosperous and
at peace.''
   The president said the government should seize this moment to
``solidify economic freedom'' through his proposals to reduce the
deficit, invest in the future and address ``urgent priorities''
without raising taxes.
   ``Let us recognize that we stand at a special moment in our
history. It is a moment not for complacency, not to sit back and
reflect upon what has bene, but to reflect upon what might be,'' the
president said.
   Bush pushed for his plan to reduce the capital gains tax to 15
percent on long-held assets and eliminate the capital gains tax for
people with incomes under $20,000 a year.
   ``Restoring the capital gains differential will lift revenues,
help savings, and free American businesses, without distorting world
markets,'' he said.
   The United States should keep in mind that some Pacific Rim trade
competitors, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Korea, exempt
capital gains from taxes while Japan ``scarcely taxed them during
her meteoric rise,'' he said.
   On the other hand, he said competitors that tax capital gains
punitively, ``by punishing risk takers, they stifle opportunity. Les
opportunity means less capital to invest. Less capital, in turn,
makes countries less competitive.''
   Bush also urged ``alternative certification'' of school teachers
so that people without the usual certificates can teach.
   ``It is simply a shame that the brightest among you men and women
here tonight, coming out of science, wanting to give of yourselves
to teach the kids, couldn't qualify because you didn't have the
required number of formal education degrees,'' he said. ``It is time
we take a new look and permit those who want to give of themselves
to teach in our public schools.''
   Bush joked about the impending birth of pups to the Millie, the
first family's dog.
   Speaking of his wife Barbara, Millie's principal caretaker, who
joined him at the head table, Bush said, ``This is the most relaxed
I've seen Bar since our dog got pregnant.''
   He said that when he asked his wife if she would join him on his
Thursday-Friday trip to Colorado and Texas, she replied that she
wouldn't dream of it with the English springer spaniel expecting to
deliver any day.

   A passing vessel found 11 survivors
marooned on a small central Philippine island six days after their
cargo ship was reported missing with 28 crewmen aboard, a shipping
official said Thursday.
   Jose Agujar, general manager of the Lorenzo Shipping Corp, said a
sketchy, radio message from a cargo ship said it picked up the 11
survivors of the 1,025-ton Lorcon V on Cavili island about 370 miles
south of Manila in the Sulu Sea.
   The report quoted survivors as saying three crewmen were dead and
the remaining 14 were missing. All crewmen were Filipinos.
   Officials reported the Lorcon V, a container ship, missing on
March 9 on a voyage from Manila to Iligan on Mindanao island. He
said the vessel reported engine trouble and was being towed to
Iligan when the cable snapped in bad weather and the ship vanished.
   Agujar said the report quoted survivors as saying the vessel sank
in the Sulu Sea after being buffeted by strong waves but did not
give the date of the sinking.
   Agujar said the crewmen reported three of their companions
drowned. He said it the survivors either swam or sailed aboard a
liferaft toward Cavili. He said the crewmen will be brought to the
port of Cebu.
   He said the search for the missing crewmen is continuing. The
U.S. Air Force have sent a helicopter to join the search in the
area. Several company ships and Philippine Coast Guard rescue
vessels are also are continuing the search.

<TEXT>
   The controversy over a 1985 crash in Newfoundland
that killed 256 Americans was revived Wednesday with the leaking of
a Transport Department report questioning the conclusions of the
official investigation.
   The Canadian Aviation Safety Board concluded after a three-year
investigation that ice on the plane's wings probably caused it to
crash.
   But the Ottawa Citizen reported Wednesday that an internal report
by the Transport Department, or Transport Canada, rejected the
safety board's majority conclusion and said the investigation was
mismanaged.
   ``The Transport Canada review does not substantiate the
conclusion that the aircraft stalled probably due to
ice-contaminated wings,'' the Citizen quoted the report as saying.
``It is the opinion of the Aviation Safety Programs Branch that the
cause of this accident is considered to be undetermined.''
   Transportation Minister Benoit Bouchard announced last week he
had accepted the board's conclusion. He ruled out a judicial inquiry
into the board's handling of the investigation.
   Sandra Wood, spokesman for Transport Canada, said Bouchard made
his statement last week based on recommendations from aides and did
not know about the critical study.
   Claude LaFrance, an assistant deputy transport minister, told a
news conference he ordered the Transport Canada study in December.
But he said he didn't tell the minister or deputy minister about it
when Bouchard was briefed on the department's response to the
board's report on the crash.
   LaFrance said his study, despite its sharp criticisms of the
safety board's investigation, did not mean to second-guess the
Gander report.
   ``We were looking for anything else that we might use to promote
aviation safety,'' he said.
   LaFrance didn't answer questions about what authority the
department has to do a detailed review of the board report. In
practice, the department is only supposed to review the board's
safety recommendations.
   Bruce Pultz, a member of the safety board which was formed in
1983 to carry out investigations independently of Transport Canada,
blamed the study on bureaucratic infighting.
   He said Transport Canada ``didn't have the evidence to be able to
reject the icing conclusion.''
   ``They keep trying to discredit us to get themselves more
power,'' Pultz said.
   Ken Thorneycroft, head of the safety board, said he had not read
the Transport Canada report and had no idea such a report even
existed.
   He said his board's report into the Gander crash was not flawed
in any way, and emphasized the investigative team did not arrive at
the crash site with pre-conceived notions of the cause of the
accident.
   A judicial inquiry would not shed any additional light on the
cause of the accident, he said.
   The crash on Dec. 12, 1985 at Gander, Newfoundland, killed 248
U.S. servicemen returning to Fort Campbell, Ky., from the Middle
East and eight American crew members of the Arrow Air charter DC-8.
   Since then, it frequently has been the subject of dispute.
   The final report on the crash was approved by five of the board's
members. Four supported the minority conclusion that an in-flight
fire or explosion was the cause.
   Brian Tobin, transportation critic in the Chamber of Deputies for
the opposition Liberal Party, said the latest controversy showed a
judicial inquiry is needed to determine the cause of the Gander
crash and whether the safety board carried out the investigation
properly.

   Cheering crowds and a blaring siren greeted
Joe Runyan on Wednesday when he and 11 dogs pulled into this
historic gold mining town to claim the 17th annual Iditarod Trail
Sled Dog Race.
   It took the Nenana musher slightly more than 11 days to cover the
1,168 miles from Anchorage. His wife and baby watched as he won
$50,000 of the $250,000 purse to be shared by the first 20 finishers.
   The victory gave Runyan, 40, the ``triple crown'' in
long-distance dog mushing. Last year, he won the Alpirod, the more
sedate European version of the Iditarod, and in 1985, he won the
1,000-mile Yukon Quest from Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, to
Fairbanks.
   Runyan said his dogs were in good shape after the grueling trek.
   ``We've gone over 200 miles in 24 hours,'' he said. ``The Alaska
husky is unlike any animal on Earth. They can go 100 miles a day on
rough terrain and they can take it.''
   Runyan snapped a three-year winning streak by Susan Butcher of
Manley, but failed by about three hours to break her 1987 record
time. When he crossed the finish line, Butcher was about five miles
behind. The only other musher to win more than one Iditarod is
four-time champion Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, who was running
fourth when Runyan finished.
   Runyan, who runs a kennel about 50 miles from Fairbanks, said his
main goal simply was to reach the finish first. ``I didn't care
about the record,'' he said. ``There's always room for fine-honing
(next year).''
   Butcher, who came in second an hour and four minutes behind
Runyan, had struggled to keep up after beating him by two minutes at
the race half-way point of Iditarod, for which she won $3,000 in
silver ingots. Only once in race history has the halfway winner gone
on to victory.
   Illnesses among her dogs made it difficult to run a stronger
race, Butcher said at the finish line. The problems included
diarrhea and leg disorders that required her to bandage some of the
animals.
   She gave each of her 11 dogs a congratulatory pat after pulling
into the finish chute. ``I'm really proud of them,'' Butcher said.
   Runyan arrived in White Mountain, about 77 miles from the finish
early Wednesday. Swenson arrived in White Mountain an hour before
Runyan left, but said Runyan's team was just too strong for him to
catch.
   ``My goal now is to get it over with,'' said Swenson, who trailed
Butcher. Dee Dee Jonrowe of Willow and Lavon Barve of Wasilla were
fourth and fifth, respectively.
   ``I'm kind of feeling sorry for how we have to run the dogs at
the end,'' Jonrowe said Tuesday. ``I had to drop my leader. His foot
was sore.''
   Forty-nine mushers left the starting line in Anchorage on March
4. Eight scratched along the way.
   Nome, the last town of any size before the International Date
Line, took on a party atmosphere Tuesday, helped by sunny skies and
temperatures that rose to the 20s.
   Workers in Nome, which has 4,300 people and looks out over the
frozen Norton Sound, moved snow onto Front Sreet, normally swept
clean for traffic, in anticipation of the mushers' arrival.
   Volunteers at the Iditarod office a block away updated race
standings from reports submitted by ham radio operators along the
trail.
   ``I think (author) Jack London put it best _ `It's the call of
the wild.''' volunteer Peter Elstub said.
   Elstub, a British soldier, said he had come to Alaska for eight
of the last 17 races. In 1987, when he was on duty in the Falkland
Islands, he telephoned Iditarod headquarters for race updates, he
said.
   For locals, the Iditarod days ``give people a reason to be
outside and just walk around town and see what happened all winter
long while they were holed up in their houses,'' said Mary Knodel, a
shopkeeper whose store overlooks the finish line.
   Marylou Haggren, a Kodiak resident, said she and her husband made
hotel reservations a year ago for Iditarod week in Nome.
   ``We just got back from the Lower 48, and down there everyone's
talking basketball,'' Mrs. Haggren said as she lingered in the
Iditarod office. ``Different lifestyles, I guess.''

   The government presented its new
budget Wednesday with a blunt warning that South Africans face
rising taxes and a higher cost of living.
   ``Every South African will have to make a sacrifice in the battle
against an economic onslaught which is being organized against the
country internationally,'' said Finance Minister Barend du Plessis
in a speech to Parliament, referring to anti-apartheid sanctions.
   The budget totaling 63.6 billion rand, or $25.4 billion, is up
12.5 percent from last year and the biggest allocations once again
are for the military and education.
   Defense spending is projected at $3.6 billion, up 13.7 percent,
and total spending for education is projected at $4.7 billion, an
increase of 19 percent.
   Du Plessis announced that the general sales tax, already one of
the world's highest, would rise from 12 percent to 13 percent and
said excise taxes on liquor and cigarettes also would increase.
   He said the ``unacceptably high'' 1988 inflation rate, which
averaged 12.9 percent, was certain to increase in 1989. Experts have
forecast a 15 percent inflation rate later this year.
   Total revenues are projected at $21.64 billion, with a third
coming from the general sales tax and the fuel tax. Du Plessis said
the deficit would be 4.1 percent of the gross domestic product, but
he did not provide that projected figure.
   Regarding sanctions imposed on South Africa to protest apartheid,
or the government's policy of racial separation, du Plessis said the
economy has managed to survive but he conceded that opportunities
for growth are being lost.

   A make-believe fire swept
the cabin of a space shuttle mockup Wednesday, and airmen posing as
injured astronauts were evacuated by ground crews practicing for
Saturday's landing of the real shuttle Discovery.
   ``We want to ensure all our people are professionally trained and
can respond to any emergency,'' said Joe D'Agostino, airfield
support coordinator for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration. ``Our goal is to safely remove astronauts. We like
that good warm feeling.''
   The simulated shuttle landing emergency went well, D'Agostino
said. NASA routinely conducts such exercises before real shuttle
landings.
   Discovery is scheduled to end its five-day mission by landing at
6:34 a.m. PST Saturday at this Mojave Desert military base 80 miles
north of Los Angeles.
   ``Saturday looks good for a landing,'' with sunny skies and mild
winds likely, NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said.
   D'Agostino said Discovery might touch down on a concrete runway
to conduct braking and crosswind landing tests needed to pave the
way for eventual resumption of shuttle landings at Kennedy Space
Center in Florida. Shuttles normally land here on the 7-mile-long
Runway 17, an unpaved, hardpacked clay surface strip at Rogers Dry
Lake.
   About 200 NASA and Air Force personnel and 30 vehicles converged
on concrete Runway 22 to start Wednesday afternoon's mock landing
exercise.
   During the simulation, ground crews pretended that a normal
landing was followed immediately by a cabin fire inside the shuttle
orbiter. The five fake astronauts pretended to be incapacitated and
were carried out by Air Force firefighters, D'Agostino said. They
were placed aboard helicopters and flown over a nearby ridge as if
they were being transported to a hospital, he added.
   ``We're looking to see if the (Air Force) fire department can
correctly extract the people,'' Agostino said.
   Discovery is scheduled to return to Earth after orbiting Earth 79
times. That's one less orbit than planned due to the one-hour,
50-minute delay in the shuttle's launch Monday caused by fog and
strong high-level winds at the Kennedy Space Center.
   Lovato said Edwards forecasters predicted unobstructed visibility
and no rain Saturday, with scattered clouds at 25,000 feet and
northwest winds at about 12 mph until 8 a.m. _ well after the
scheduled landing _ increasing to 14 mph with gusts to 21 mph.
   But Friday's forecast calls for west-northwest winds 23 mph
gusting to 35 mph, probably too high for a landing, Lovato said.
   NASA prefers to land the shuttle on the Runway 17, an unpaved dry
lake, where there is plenty of room for error if brake or steering
problems develop. If the lakebed is wet and muddy, a paved runway at
Edwards is second choice, followed by White Sands Missile Range in
New Mexico, and then the concrete runway at Kennedy Space Center.
   The lone shuttle mission diverted from Edwards was the Columbia,
on the third shuttle mission in March 1982, when rain turned the
lakebed to muck and the Colombia landed at White Sands, Lovato said.

   The lights came back on the Discovery space
shuttle Wednesday after Mission Control apparently fixed a
troublesome hydrogen tank and told the astronauts not to worry about
conserving energy.
   Discovery's five astronauts had switched off unnecessary lights
and computers because of concern about erratic pressure readings
from one of three hydrogen tanks aboard the shuttle. The tank, which
helps supply electricity, was taken out of service Tuesday while
engineers studied the problem.
   The crew turned the tank back on Wednesday morning but used only
one of its two heaters. Mission Control told the crew that early
pressure readings showed the tank was working properly.
   ``That's good news to hear,'' replied Discovery commander Michael
Coats.
   The hydrogen is combined with oxygen in the fuel cells to produce
electricity for shuttle systems, with water as a byproduct.
   Ground controllers were concerned that without use of the third
hydrogen tank, there may not be enough electricity to support a
five-day flight, plus two days for contingencies.
   But flight director Chuck Shaw said Wednesday night that the tank
operated properly with one heater all day, meaning Discovery is
headed for a 6:34 a.m. PST landing time Saturday at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., as planned.
   ``There are absolutely no problems at all,'' Shaw said, adding
that the tank would continue running while the astronauts slept.
   The tank presented no constraints ``to flying all the way to the
end of the mission and landing on Saturday,'' he said.
   Granvil Pennington, another flight director, also said weather
conditions for a Saturday landing look very good.
   Earlier Wednesday, the astronauts were told they didn't have to
continue to conserve electricity.
   The astronauts could turn on lights and use them ``as they see
fit.''
   Similar erratic pressure readings were noted on the same hydrogen
tank on Discovery's flight last fall and posed no power problems to
the vehicle's operations, Pennington added.
   NASA officials said the problem did not pose any safety threat to
the crew.
   The five astronauts went about the business of monitoring
experiments and trying to photograph environmentally damaged areas
of the Earth, including scars from a recent fire in the Florida
everglades and an erupting volcano in Guatamala.
   They also conducted medical tests on each other. While floating
on the flight deck, Dr. James M. Bagian took Coats' blood pressure,
checked his pulse and pressed a small device to his temple to
measure the blood flow in his head.
   The tests were to help determine what effect zero gravity has on
blood flow.
   Mission Control awoke the crew with a full brass band rendition
of the Marine Corps Hymn.
   ``We got two Marines standing at attention up here,'' joked
Coats, a Navy captain. ``What do we do now?''
   Astronauts James F. Buchli and Robert C. Springer are Marine
colonels. Bagian is a physician, and pilot John E. Blaha is an Air
Force colonel.
   Discovery's primary mission _ deployment of a $100 million
communications satellite _ was completed Monday several hours after
the shuttle rocketed into orbit.
   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite completes a network that
will allow ground controllers almost unbroken radio contact with
shuttles and other satellites. The satellite deployed Monday and
another launched last year will provide the nearly continuous
coverage, while a third one above the Earth will act as an in-orbit
spare.
   The Discovery flight is the first of seven shuttle missions
planned this year and the 28th overall. It also is the third shuttle
flight since the Challenger exploded and killed its seven astronauts
more than three years ago.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday
stayed the execution of mass murderer R. Gene Simmons, who had
scorned appeals of his death warrant, after a fellow inmate asked
the high court to intervene.
   Simmons was to be executed at 7 a.m. Thursday for killing 14
members of his family at Christmastime 1987. Simmons, convicted last
month, waived his appeals and would have been the first prisoner
executed by Arkansas in 25 years.
   The other death row inmate, Jonas Whitmore, petitioned the U.S.
Supreme Court on Tuesday to stop Simmons' execution. Whitmore,
concerned about the effect that Simmons' execution could have on his
own case, contended that the U.S. Constitution mandates an appeal in
capital cases.
   Whitmore filed the petition with Justice Harry Blackmun, who
referred the petition to the entire court, which stayed the
execution pending Whitmore's filing of a petition asking the court
to review the Simmons case.
   Should the court refuse to hear the case, ``this stay terminates
automatically,'' the unsigned opinion said.
   Simmons and Whitmore were not available for comment.
   When prison officials told Simmons that his execution would not
be carried out as planned, according to prison spokesman David
White, Simmons was eating his requested ``last meal.''
   According to White, Simmons' only reaction was to request if he
could finish his dinner _ which, at his request, included a
well-cooked filet, six rolls, six slices of cheese, two raw sliced
onions, two tomatoes, a banana and two 7-Ups.
   Judge John Patterson, who presided over the trial and set
Simmons' execution date, refused comment Wednesday night.
   Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton said the ruling ``came as a complete
shock to me and I don't understand it.''
   Then, referring to a death sentence in another case against
Simmons for two murders in Russelville, Ark., the governor said,
``I'll move now to set the other execution date.''
   Whitmore's lawyer, Arthur Allen, said he was relieved by the
court's ruling. ``Now we have adequate time to address some
important constitutional issues,'' he said. ``It's obvious the court
realized an important issue was to be addressed here, otherwise they
wouldn't have issued the stay.''
   Whitmore's petition contends the federal Constitution requires an
appellate court to review a Simmons' conviction to keep the death
penalty from being imposed arbitrarily. The Supreme Court of
Arkansas on Monday rejected Whitmore's petition by saying he lacked
legal standing to address Simmons' rights.
   The Arkansas Democrat, a Little Rock newspaper, published a
letter Wednesday from Simmons in which he called Arkansas' death
penalty ineffective.
   ``One of the things I wanted to say in court (which would have
answered one of your questions) is that Arkansas does not have a
meaningful death penalty, it is a facade,'' Simmons wrote in
response to questions contained in a note given to him after a March
9 federal court hearing.
   In an earlier case involving Simmons, the Arkansas Supreme Court
said the U.S. Constitution does not require an automatic appeal. The
court said there must be an appellate review of whether a prisoner
sentenced to death is competent to waive his appeals. On Friday, the
Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Simmons was competent when he
waived his appeal last month.
   Simmons was arrested on Dec. 28, 1987, in Russellville after a
shooting rampage that left two people dead. When police went to his
rural home near Dover, they found the 14 bodies of family members.
Simmons was convicted last year of murdering the two Russellville
residents and sentenced to die. That execution was stayed, but that
stay was lifted last week.
   Whitmore was convicted in the 1986 robbery-murder of former
Montgomery County clerk Essie May Black, 62.
   Simmons' execution would be the 107th carried out since the 1976
U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the death
penalty.

   A caller with a Middle Eastern accent told a
radio station Wednesday that a group called Guardians of the Islamic
Revolution was responsible for the bombing of a van driven by the
wife of the USS Vincennes' skipper.
   Los Angeles radio station KNX said the person made the claim
during a call to the newsroom Wednesday morning. The caller claimed
to be a member of the group, which also claimed responsibility for
the crash of a Pan Am jetliner last year at Lockerbie, Scotland.
   Station officials said the call was immediately reported to the
FBI.
   According to KNX, the caller said the group threatened to carry
out additional attacks against Vincennes skipper Capt. Will C.
Rogers III and his family. The caller also said the bombing was
linked directly to last year's downing of an Iranian airliner by the
Vincennes.
   Fred Reagan, an FBI spokesman in Los Angeles, confirmed that the
bureau is investigating the call.
   ``We're looking into it,'' Reagan said. He declined to elaborate.
   Guardians of the Islamic Revolution is an Islamic group that made
persistent claims to international news organizations that it was
responsible for the crash of Pan Am Flight 103 on Dec. 21. The crash
killed 259 people aboard the plane and 11 on the ground.
   A caller claiming to represent the group also warned on Dec. 30
that if the United States did not deport Reza Pahlavi, son of the
former Shah of Iran, ``there will be another present in the New Year
for America.''
   The group has previously claimed responsibility for a July 1987
car bombing in London that wounded a former Iranian cabinet
minister. More recently, it threatened to kill British officials and
a London talk show host over comments regarding Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's call to kill author Salman Rushdie.
   Rogers was commanding the Vincennes last July when its crew
mistook an Iranian jetliner for an attacking warplane and shot it
down with a missile, killing all 290 people aboard.
   He and his wife, Sharon, have been under protection of Navy
security agents since Friday's bombing of the family van.
   Mrs. Rogers, who was driving to work alone, escaped uninjured.
She got out moments before the van caught fire and burned at a busy
San Diego intersection because she thought the van had been bumped
by the car behind her, fire officials said.
   Rogers emerged from seclusion Tuesday to take the helm of the
Vincennes as the FBI continued its investigation into the bombing,
summoning an expert in terrorist explosives.
   Rogers guided the ship out of the San Diego Naval Station for
routine, daylong exercises off the coast, a Navy spokesman said.
   FBI spokesman Ron Orrantia said no possible motives for the
attack on the van have been ruled out, including retribution for the
airliner downing.
   Gregory Jones, an FBI spokesman in Washington, said it's ``too
early to be pinpointing the cause and culprits of this act.''
   FBI officials said the bomb was a non-military device, possibly a
pipe bomb.
   Mrs. Rogers took the week off from her job as a fourth-grade
teacher at a private school in La Jolla.

   Riot police stormed a subway depot and
arrested at least 1,600 strikers after a walkout on Thursday
paralyzed most of the capital's subway system and stranded hundreds
of thousands of commuters.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of radical students fought riot police
with firebombs, clubs and rocks in three cities. Groups from 38
colleges announced a nationwide campaign to defeat President Roh
Tae-woo in a referendum next month on Roh's reforms.
   In Seoul, the government organized emergency transport and urged
commuters to try to get to work as about 6,000 subway workers struck
to demand dismissal of the subway system's president. About 3
million of the capital's 10 million residents use the system daily.
   About 4,000 police firing tear gas stormed a depot occupied by
about 3,000 strikers. The state television network said police
arrested about 2,600 strikers. Police officials put arrests at about
1,600.
   Strikers armed with lead pipes and clubs had occupied the depot
and put up barricades, demanding that the city government meet their
demands. Police with bulldozers knocked down the barricades and
overpowered strikers hurling firebombs and rocks.
   About 15,000 riot police were deployed at subway stations to
prevent protests by strikers and to protect management and
non-striking workers, who struggled to maintain partial service on
some lines.
   Some non-union workers reported for work and the government
drafted locomotive operators from the national railways to help keep
some subway trains running. Subway officials said about 6,000 of the
system's 7,732 staff were involved in the protest.
   Subway union officials and the city government earlier reached an
agreement on new pay and working conditions. The unionists then
struck after accusing subway corporation president Kim Myong-nyon of
acting in bad faith during negotiations, and demanding that he be
fired.
   They wanted Mayor Koh Kun to sign the labor accord, saying they
did not trust the subway people, but Koh said he does not represent
the subway corporation.
   About 700 students, many shouting ``Down with Roh Tae-woo!,''
battled police for an hour Wednesday outside the main gate of
Seoul's Sejong University. Police responded with tear gas. No
arrests or injuries were reported.
   Fighting also broke out at Dankuk University in southern Seoul
where about 500 students, demanding Roh's resignation and a halt to
joint U.S.-South Korea military exercises now being held, tried to
march into the streets.
   Police tear gas dispersed the protesters after a two-hour battle.
   In the central city of Taejon, about 1,000 students, hurling
firebombs and rocks, battled riot police. In the southern city of
Kwangju, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported, about 5,000
students held an anti-Roh rally.
   Roh made a 1987 campaign pledge to seek a midterm appraisal of
his performance after the Seoul Olympics, which ended in October. He
said last week he will fulfill the pledge by holding a referendum.
   Roh says that in the referendum, people will simply be asked to
assess the progress of democratic reforms he introduced after his
inauguration 13 months ago.

   Schools across the country are banning apples
from lunchrooms even as one health expert mocks educators' fears of
the farm chemical Alar as a ``toxic bogeyman.''
   On Tuesday, school systems in Chicago, Minneapolis-St. Paul and
in Virginia joined districts in New York City, Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Sacramento, Cincinnati, Atlanta and elsewhere in
suspending sales of apples, applesauce and apple juice. The bans
follow a report that children faced increased cancer risks from the
chemical that's used to make some apples crisper and brighter.
   Seeking to slow the spread of apple bans and soothe consumer
alarm, California's top health officer said educators were acting
hastily.
   Kenneth Kizer, director of the state Department of Health
Services, pulled out a shiny red apple and took a bite as he
explained that current research on Alar, a trade name for the
compound daminozide, shouldn't prompt anybody to quit eating the
fruit.

   The Bush administration announced today the
immediate suspension of imports of thousands of semiautomatic
assault-type weapons.
   The order will bar the importation of more than 110,000 such
weapons for which import applications are pending, said national
drug control director William J. Bennett.
   Bennett said Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady ``decided to
suspend, effective immediately, the importation of several makes of
assault-type weapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons
are, as required by law, `particularly suitable for or readily
adaptable to sporting purposes','' Bennett said.
   Bennett and Brady had been asked by President Bush to look into
ways of dealing with the proliferation of such weapons amid mounting
violence among drug dealers in inner city areas.

   The first attempt to crystallize a virus in
space is taking place aboard Discovery as scientists use
weightlessness to try to design better crops and new drugs against
cancer, AIDS, emphysema and other diseases.
   ``From the crystals we will be able to learn the structure'' of
the virus, said biochemist Alexander McPherson of the University of
California, Riverside.
   ``If we know the crystal structures of viruses, we may be able to
design vaccines to prevent infection or drugs to lessen the effects
of infection'' by binding to targets on viruses that cause AIDS,
certain cancers, hepatitis, influenza and the common cold, he added.
   The virus in McPherson's shuttle-borne experiment is a harmless
one named STMV, or satellite tobacco mosaic virus. It is a parasite
virus that can replicate itself only when attached to TMV, or
tobacco mosaic virus, a disease that afflicts tobacco, tomato,
pepper and certain other plants.

   Eighty percent of the tax benefits from
President Bush's proposed cut in capital-gains taxes would go to
people with incomes over $100,000 a year, congressional analysts say.
   An estimated 1.25 million couples and individuals who make more
than $100,000 and report capital gains would get tax cuts averaging
$12,315, according to a study by the staff of the Joint Committee on
Taxation. The 376,000 with incomes over $200,000 would get 60
percent of the total reduction, their cuts averaging $30,820.
   Despite such figures, Bush on Tuesday maintained that his plan is
``not a special tax break for the rich.''
   The estimates were presented Tuesday to the Senate Finance
Committee, which heard the Treasury Department hail Bush's proposal
as one of the most important things Congress could do to ensure
economic growth.

   U.S. officials say the conviction of Lebanese
hijacker Fawaz Younis affirms the ``long-arm'' tactics they used to
lure him aboard a yacht in the Mediterranean Sea with promises of
sex and drugs.
   The black-haired, bearded Younis, held in isolation since his
arrest in September 1987, was convicted Tuesday in U.S. District
Court of leading five heavily armed men aboard Royal Jordanian
Airlines flight 402 in Beirut, Lebanon, on June 11, 1985.
   The hijackers, members of Lebanon's Amal militia, a Shiite Moslem
group, held the 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours to
publicize their demands for aid in their battle against Palestinian
refugees.
   No one was killed in the incident, and Younis testified that he
led the hijacking under orders from the militia.

<HEAD>Lobby Fuss Mirrors Persisting Southern Baptist Conflict</HEAD>

   The two men stood, snapping at each other, in the
foyer of the Southern Baptist Convention Building in Nashville,
Tenn., as about 45 people gathered around to listen.
   It reflected, in miniature, the frayed emotions of a long and
persistent conflict in the country's largest Protestant body between
moderates and now dominant fundamentalists.
   Paul Pressler, an architect of the fundamentalist ascendancy,
told the Rev. Richard Jackson, a Phoenix moderate that his comments
were ``an attack and a slur on my character.''
   ``You have no right to be so judgmental of me,'' added Pressler,
a Houston appeals court judge. ``You owe me an apology.''
   Jackson countered, ``I don't owe you an apology.'' Then he
repeated four times, ``You don't have one.'' Jackson, who failed
last year by a hairbreadth to win the presidency of the 14.8
million-member denomination, added:
   ``Somebody finally needed to stand face to face with you and say
these things.''
   The recorded flareup came late last month after a subcommittee
recommended a fundamentalist-pushed project to undercut
inter-Baptist representation in Washington by setting up a separate
office.
   However, the hallway argument ranged over differences dating back
over the last 10 years about Pressler's role as strategist for
gaining fundamentalist predominance by successively winning the
presidency since 1979.
   The president's appointive power determines trustees of the
denomination's huge network of agencies and institutions, on a
gradual basis, and last year's presidential outcome marked the shift
to general fundamentalist control.
   That includes a current majority of the central oversight body,
the executive committee, which approved the subcommittee's
recommednation, voting 42-27 to set up the separate Washington
agency.
   Called the Religious Liberty Committee, it would serve as ``an
alternative'' to the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs, a
longtime religious liberty watchdog for nine Baptist bodies in the
nation's capital.
   The plan provides that the denomination, through its new arm,
would continue ``relationship'' with the inter-Baptist office, but
also run its own activities.
   The action remains subject to two successive annual conventions,
the first one this June in Las Vegas, Nev.
   Fundamentalists have steadily criticized the joint agency,
especially for not advocating prayer in public schools nor opposing
abortion. The joint agency contends its mandate prevents involvement
in the abortion debate.
   The Rev. James M. Dunn, the agency's executive director, called
the move to set up a separate Southern Baptist office
``short-sighted and divisive.''
   He said the joint agency has provided a ``consistent witness to
religious liberty'' and ``will not compromise historic Baptist
convictions for a mess of politically tainted pottage.''
   This was only one of the issues festering in the denomination,
including status of its educational institutions.
   One of them, Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary in Wake
Forest, N.C., has been found failing to meet accreditation
standards, following resignation of its former administration in
protest at trustee changes.
   A study committee of the Southern Association of Colleges and
Schools said new requirements of belief in biblical inerrancy
appears to have been arbitrarily imposed and responsibility of
faculty curtailed.
   ``Biblical inerrancy'' is the yardstick pressed by
fundamentalists, now prevailing among institutional trustees, and
broadly applied through the denomination's operations.
   Although insistence on this literalistic view of the Bible
powered the fundamentalist drive, the Rev. Milton Ferguson,
president of Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Kansas City,
observes:
   ``The real issue is no longer the Bible, but whether or not we
can and will find ways to re-establish trust among ourselves.''
   Moderates, beaten out in the last decade of elections, have
sought mutual reinforcement in new independent organizations such as
the Southern Baptist Alliance, a coalition of about 50 churches
totalling 40,000.
   It insists on the ``soul competence'' of individuals to interpret
the Bible as they understand it _ an historic Baptist principle.
   The denomination's past principles ``are in eclipse,'' Kirby
Godsey, president of the denomination's Mercer University in Macon,
Ga., told an alliance meeting last fall.
   ``In the midst of these frightening shadows of denominational
elipse we huddle together to find reassurance and light enough to
sustain us,'' he said. ``We are Baptists in a denomination that has
stopped being Baptist.''
   The alliance insists it doesn't presently plan any break from the
denomination, but is planning to help fund a new seminary not
dominated by fundamentalists.
   Another unofficial group called Baptists Committed to the
Southern Baptist Convention, was formed last December, saying it
represents the centrist mainstream of Southern Baptists.
   ``We support the restoration of our convention, not its
destruction,'' says the Rev. Winfred Moore of Amarillo, Texas,
chairman of the group and twice unsuccessful candidate for the
denominational presidency.
   Whether moderates will enter a presidential candidate in June,
after nine years of defeats, remained uncertain, but the
fundamentalist-backed incumbent, the Rev. Jerry Vines of
Jacksonville, Fla., says he is open to re-election.

   After being partly tricked in his effort to help

   As pastor of Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Gourley exhausted a

   But after one man reportedly used the $100 to buy an assault

extension of the program would require a signed promise not to use
the money to buy another weapon.

<HEAD>Good Guy Mike Connors Gets It in `Murder, She Wrote'</HEAD>

   Mike Connors, television's long-time good guy,
private eye and FBI agent, finally bites the dust on screen in an
episode of CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote.''
   ``Let me tell you, lying on the floor is the easiest acting I've
ever done,'' said Connors.
   Connors, who dodged bullets on ``Tightrope,'' ``Mannix'' and
``Today's FBI'' and is host of the syndicated show ``Crimes of the
Century,'' is the victim on Sunday's episode of ``Murder, She
Wrote.'' The hit series stars Angela Lansbury as crime-solving
mystery writer Jessica Fletcher.
   He plays a screenwriter who's adapting one of Jessica's books as
a movie.
   ``He's a throwback character, a combination of Humphrey Bogart
and John Garfield,'' said Connors. ``He's driving from Las Vegas and
takes a detour and sees an old girlfriend slinging hash. He says,
`There she was, a little worse for wear, but still a hot cup of
coffee to a thirsty guy like me.'
   ``We do some flashbacks in black and white. Then I'm shot, and I
grab a tape recorder and start telling the story of why I was shot.
It's because of that style that I was intrigued with the show.''
   Connors said the only other time he has been killed on screen was
early in his career when he did a movie for Roger Corman.
   He will also be seen in May when the final 12 hours of ``War and
Remembrance'' are telecast by ABC. He plays Hack Peters, a colonel
who is working on the atomic bomb and gets involved with Rhoda
Henry, the wife of Pug Henry.
   His latest series is ``Crimes of the Century,'' which re-creates
famous crimes from the Lindbergh kidnapping to the ``Yorkshire
Ripper'' in England.
   ``What's so fascinating is not the crime but the information that
comes up,'' said Connors. ``Information that might have changed the
outcome of the case. Sam Sheppard (whose conviction in the
bludgeoning death of his wife was later overturned) claimed that he
saw a bushy-haired man. But the murder weapon, believed to be fire
tongs, was never found.
   ``His next-door neighbor was a bushy-haired man and after he died
the new owner of the house was doing some digging and found the
missing fire tongs.''
   The show began as two highly rated specials on ABC, but became a
syndicated series because, Connors said, ABC News objected to a
regular, reality-based show produced outside the network.
   Connors starred on CBS as private detective Joe Mannix from 1967
to '75. Mannix began as an employee of a computerized detective
agency, but soon switched over to the traditional format. Joseph
Campanella was his boss the first year. After that, Robert Reed
became his police contact and Gail Fisher was his secretary.
   He said he's ready to do a ``Mannix'' movie, but Paramount has
turned down all requests so far.
   ``I get a call from some independent producer about every six
months,'' he said. ``I'm interested as long as the script and story
is not childish. But nothing ever happens. Paramount won't sell the
rights, nor will they do a movie. All we want is a license to do a
two-hour movie.''
   His most recent feature film was ``The Fistfighter,'' and before
that he starred in and produced ``Too Scared to Scream.'' Anne
Archer co-starred and Tony Lo Bianco directed on location in New
York. ``That film took about two years of my life,'' Connors said.
   He recently participated in a recording and video to benefit the
victims of the earthquake in the Armenian republic in the Soviet
Union. More than 100 performers took part in the recording.
   Connors is of Armenian descent and occasionally explored his
background in ``Mannix.'' He also made a pilot called ``Ohanian,''
which is his real name.

<HEAD>Financial Protection Against Disability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You have life insurance, health insurance, home
insurance, car insurance. That covers all the bases, right?
   Well, maybe not. It might just be that you aren't protected
against another common risk _ that you could suffer some disability
that prevents you from keeping your job.
   Any agent who sells disability insurance can quote you daunting
figures about the accidents and ills that befall people, ending
their working careers or keeping them out of work for extended
periods.
   ``Statistics show that even at age 60 a person is more likely to
be disabled for more than 90 days than die prematurely,'' says
William Brennan, who is not an insurance salesman but who edits the
newsletter Financial Planning Reporter for the accounting firm of
Ernst &amp; Whinney.
   ``What few people appreciate are the severe economic consequences
of a disability. Wages can be lost, substantial uninsured medical
expenses incurred _even the children's education may be sacrificed.''
   If you have not considered this question before now, advisers on
matters of personal finance say, the answer is not to panic and run
out to buy the first disability policy you can find.
   Rather, they suggest setting some time aside to assess where your
present disability protection stands and what, if anything, you need
to do to improve it.
   Many people assume that if they are disabled, they will get
something from Social Security, state disability insurance programs,
and their employer to tide them over.
   In fact, they may indeed stand to get benefits from any or all of
those sources. Perhaps you also have a large amount of savings put
aside in the event of what used to be spoken of euphemistically as
``a rainy day.''
   If a careful calculation shows that these sources together would
keep your family solvent should some major disaster befell you, then
you may not need to bother with any further insurance. That's nice,
because private disability insurance isn't cheap.
   But if the numbers don't add up quite so nicely, and you're the
the only wage-earner in a household with three children under the
age of 6, an expert might advise you that ``disability income'' is a
product for you.
   In that event, you need to do some shopping, not just to compare
premium rates but to give careful study to the details of available
policies. A primary issue to consider: How the insurer defines
``disability.''
   Says Brennan, ``Steer clear of policies that only provide
benefits if you're unable to perform duties of ANY occupation. More
liberal policies define disability as the inability to perform the
duties of your particular occupation.''
   In addition, he says, you should determine that the policy can't
be canceled or the premiums increased as long as you continue to pay
them on time.
   Other matters to investigate include whether the policy provides
any inflation protection, since you may need to rely on it for many
years, and whether it covers a partial disability that reduces but
doesn't eliminate your livelihood.
   Most policies specify a waiting period _ say, 30 days _ between
the onset of the disability and the start of benefits. The cost of
the premiums can be reduced substantially by increasing the waiting
period.
   ``As you might have guessed,'' Brennan concludes, ``the more
liberal the definition of disability, the higher the premium costs.
   ``Don't let the costs scare you away, however. Disability
insurance fills a huge gap which could be left in an otherwise
carefully constructed financial plan.''

<HEAD>Consequences of A Tight Labor Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tight labor market can be observed in various
ways: through one's own observations, by reading the Labor
Department's latest job survey and by listening to concerns of
small-business owners.
   Personal observation, such as in a visit to a fast-food outlet,
might be most convincing. Remember when smart, eager young workers
rushed to serve you? Service now isn't quite what it was. It's a
real problem for the industry.
   The latest Labor Department job survey offers documentation of
the tightening of the supply of workers. In February, civilian
unemployment declined to 5.1 percent, a 14-year low, while
employment rose by 290,000 jobs.
   But even more significant is the breakdown. The jobless decline
was almost solely among those age 16 years to 24 years, where skills
are limited. And the job gains were in companies that produce
services rather than goods.
   Reflecting these trends are the concerns of small-business
operators as indicated by responses from 1,600 businesses, most of
whom employ fewer than nine workers, to a survey by National Small
Business United.
   Asked to name the three major problems facing their businesses,
the survey respondents gave the following rankings:
   1. Government regulations.
   2. Labor quality, educational level of workers and job training.
   3. Labor and payroll costs.
   The first concern isn't surprising. Small businesses long have
felt oppressed by the enormous number of government regulations that
impact their businesses and add oppressive paperwork requirements.
   The next two aren't especially surprising either; everyone knows
small businesses constantly worry about labor costs and other labor
issues, such as losing good workers after spending many dollars and
months training them.
   What is surprising is the position these labor issues occupy,
outranking such concerns as federal taxes, competition, interest
rates, capital costs, and state and local taxes, all major worries
for years.
   And, while it isn't identified specifically as a labor issue, the
fourth-ranked item reflects the tightening labor market. It is
insurance costs _ not just liability insurance, as in the past, but
health insurance as well.
   When it is tough to get good workers, as it is now, small
businesses are forced to meet competition not just by raising wages
but by offering other inducements too, and one of the most effective
is health insurance.
   The survey found that one of the most significant differences
from 1987 to 1988 was the rising level of benefits offered by small
business. At the top was health insurance; seventy-seven percent
offered it in 1987, 91 percent in 1988.
   Small businesses are especially sensitive to labor changes
because theirs is the job of training entrants to the world of
commercial work. And to a great extent, the smaller the business the
greater the sensitivity and vulnerability.
   Those responding to this survey generally were very small. More
than 88 percent said they had fewer than 50 workers. The majority
reported annual sales of less than $5 million and 25 percent had
sales below $250,000.
   All respondents are members of National Small Business United,
which grew from a merger of the National Small Business Association
and the Council of Smaller Enterprises, whose membership included
regional advocacy groups.

   The tiny Indian girl was beyond help.
Just three months old, she was blind, severely dehydrated and
stricken with pneumonia. The baby's illness, her mother said, began
with a compliment.
   ``It's a superstition here that if somebody tells you your baby
is pretty, something bad will happen to it,'' said Pamela Lear, a
nurse practitioner from Greenville, Ky., and a 1st lieutenant in the
Kentucky National Guard.
   The baby also was coated with dried herbs when her mother brought
her to the mountaintop clinic. A ``zahorin,'' or traditional healer,
had tried in the ancient Mayan way to ward off the spirits believed
to be afflicting the child.
   To Lear and Lt. Col. Paula Maionchi, a Richmond, Ky., physician,
it was obvious that something bad had surely happened. It was
equally obvious that it had nothing to do with compliments and
curses.
   It had to do with severe vitamin A deficiency, debilitating
diarrhea, intestinal parasites _ and the tragic decision of a young
mother in an isolated society to turn first to a medicine man for
help. Maionchi arranged the baby's transfer to a hospital two hours
away in Guatemala City. She died en route.
   It was the gravest illness that the 475th Mobile Army Surgical
Hospital and 973rd Dental Detachment would face this day in the
Sierra Madre where the guards spent part of a two-week training and
humanitarian-aid mission.
   In a larger sense, the child's illness was a severe example of
problems that are widespread in a Mayan population where infant
mortality is high, life expectancy is low and the time in between is
arduous. Half of Guatemala's 7.7 million residents are descendants
of the Mayans.
   Lear and Capt. Douglas Stevens, a Lexington, Ky., physician, were
seeing ailments they didn't encounter at home, including
tuberculosis in young people. Parasitic diseases were rampant,
malnutrition and bronchitis were common.
   Up to 80 percent of Mayan children die before their first
birthdays, said Col. Michael McConnell, chief surgeon of the U.S.
Army's Southern Command. The guards were seeing ``the ones that made
it through,'' said McConnell, who observed the training and
treatment here and at Choatulum and Chemachoy.
   At each site, the guards set up shop in a tiny clinic of a
standard government design _ three small examining rooms off a
compact waiting area. The clinics were equipped with cold water and
almost nothing else.
   The clinic in Xepatan was without heat or light. Capt. David
O'Banion, a Louisville dentist, and Sgt. Charisse Newton, a
Frankfort dental technician, extracted teeth by the light of
battery-powered head lamps.
   At Choatalum, the line of patients was long but Dr. Joseph Dobner
wasn't seeing unusual cases. The tiny, bullet-riddled building in
which he set up his clinic, however, was a far cry from his
Frankfort office. Part of the roof had been blown away and the
windows shattered. Electricity came from a generator ``so loud that
I can't listen to the lungs, ... so we tend not to use it.''
   ``I'm high-tech in a very low-tech situation,'' said Dobner, a
lieutenant colonel in the 475th MASH and an orthopedic surgeon.
   ``When you put any organization through a rigorous situation,
they're going to learn and it's going to forge them into a more
cohesive unit and they learn how to work with adversity. And boy,
we're working with adversity.''
   The Mayans also have suffered from Guatemala's 30-year-old civil
war. Government critics say the military engaged in a ``scorched
earth'' campaign to rid the countryside of rebels and their
potential supporters among Indians.
   National Guard units from Iowa and Georgia preceded Kentucky's
under an agreement with the Guatemalan government. Each exercise was
conducted with the army medical corps, Ministry of Health and the
Animal Health Agency.
   Like his colleagues, Dobner spent his time treating parasitic
infections, lung ailments and dispensing ointments and pain
relievers for countless aching joints and muscles that are the
legacy of life in the rugged Sierra Madre.
   ``I'm amazed at these people. You don't see much in the way of
major orthopedic problems because they're dead. They don't have a
chance. If they're at all infirm, they're gone,'' Dobner said.
   There is ``no training opportunity that even comes close to
this'' at home, said Maj. Allen Youngman, assistant chief of staff.
``This is an opportunity to do something right that maybe we haven't
done right in the past.''
   For Maj. Beverly Vance, an Eastern Kentucky University nursing
instructor, it was ``the most gratifying experience I've ever had.''
   ``It will make my unit better. Support of the operation is not
what it should be, but it never is,'' Dobner said. Because
pharmaceutical needs change with the seasons, the mission also
taught the Southern Command a few things.
   The unit was learning to do without medical supplies that were
either in short supply or were used up rapidly, he said. Everyone
seeking treatment at Choatalum had head lice, for example, and
anti-lice medicine was quickly gone.
   ``Three days into the exercise and we were out of something that
would make life lots better. But the last group down here (from the
Georgia Guard) didn't use what they had because it was a different
season,'' he said.
   The stoicism of the Mayans was underscored at Xepatan, where
O'Banion and Newton averaged about two extractions per patient _ the
only practical treatment, under the circumstances, for scores with
rotted teeth.
   One of the patients, a slightly built 27-year-old man, had a
badly abscessed tooth. He probably was seeing for the first time a
long needle like the one used to shoot anesthesia into his gums, but
he didn't flinch.
   ``They live with chronic pain. The needle is no big deal,''
O'Banion said.
   But the acidity of the man's infected gum tissue negated the
anesthetic and he soon was in obvious pain. He clenched the sides of
the examining table as O'Banion worked to extract a tooth that was
shattering with each touch.
   ``It's like trying to take a piece of glass out of concrete,'' he
said. ``You just have to be patient and work at it. ... He'll feel
noticeable improvement after a couple of hours.''
   His ordeal over, the patient eased himself off the table, plunked
a battered hat on his head and moved toward the door. There he
paused and gave a broad wave to O'Banion and Newton.
   O'Banion nodded in return.
   ``Another satisfied customer,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George, a 36-year-old former heroin addict who
beat his wife, is lying to himself.
   ``The last altercation got out of hand. But before I could
wrestle the knife from my wife's hand, six cops busted in the door
and arrested me. They didn't even want to listen to my side of the
story.''
   George can tell his story when he's at the Queens Family Conflict
Center, among six other men who have inflicted violence on their
households.
   ``I don't know how hard I hit when I get angry,'' he says. ``How
can I stay without drugs when the person lying in bed is sniffing
all the coke in town. If I continue to be passive, she's going to
bring me down...
   ``She's the one who has to get help or else I'm getting a
divorce.''
   ``If she's the one who needs help for her cocaine problem then
why are you here?'' interrupted group leader Jerome Balcom. Balcom
explained later that George ``kept on straying away from the fact
that he hit his wife.''
   More than 1.8 million women will be punched, kicked or assaulted
with a weapon this year, according to a University of New Hampshire
Family Research Lab study. About 6.25 million will be slapped or
shoved.
   ``That is assuming everyone we interviewed told all,'' said lab
director Murray A. Straus. ``In my judgment, those figures should be
doubled.''
   Experts say protective court orders may give victims of domestic
violence temporary security, but the only prevention lies in
education.
   ``Lack of communication between the sexes and the inability to
communicate without violence causes the abuser to react in the only
way he knows how,'' said Ellie Ludvigsen-Jennings of the city
Probation Department.
   The abusive male is rigid toward sex roles, and has a poor
self-image and an inability to communicate with his spouse, said
Roland Maiuro, a psychologist and director of the Harborview Anger
Management Program in Washington State.
   Seventy-five percent are drug or alcohol addicts and 98 percent
were sexually abused or beaten as children, said Ludvigsen-Jennings.
``We try to stop the pattern before it gets to the point of adult
abuse.
   ``We also help victims and adolescents because once they are
abused they, just like the men, will have the tendency to abuse as
well.
   ``Our goal is to eliminate family violence.''
   Ludvigsen-Jennings and Balcom, commander of court officers for
the state court in Westchester County, started the conflict center
in 1984 in response to an increase in domestic violence in New York
City. Its six full-time staffers and 20 volunteers run 15 programs
on issues linked to family violence, including parenting, alcohol
and drug addiction and child abuse.
   About 4,000 men have participated in five years, some
voluntarily, others under court order.
   ``We try to see them the same day they are referred,''
Ludvigsen-Jennings said. ``You can't treat violence cases like any
other cases, they need immediate intervention or somebody will get
seriously hurt.''
   The aim is to make the abuser understand why he is angry and
teach him how to deal with that aggression. ``We first teach them
that they are responsible for their actions, that they are wrong to
hurt their wives and they should learn to think before acting,''
said Ludvigsen-Jennings.
   Most men don't realize what they have done is wrong, she said.
``The man sees the woman as someone beneath him, someone who should
obey his rules. When she doesn't, he feels he has every right to
`make her' act accordingly.''
   ``When we first get them they are full of denial,'' Balcom said,
``They don't believe they've done anything wrong and they'll justify
it until they're blue in the face.''
   George was typical: ``He was trying to blame his wife's drug
habit for their altercations instead of looking at why he was angry
at her.''
   Group leaders try to convince men they should walk away when they
feel a situation is getting out of control. Eventually, the abuser
should be able to let his wife know when he is approaching a
breaking point, so she can leave before it is too late.
   The breaking point, according to Balcom, can come at any time,
but usually is after the wife becomes independent of the husband.
``Sometimes the wife goes to school, gets a better job, advances
herself. Then the man feels inferior, less in control and less
needed by the wife.''
   Counselors try to replace aggressiveness with assertiveness.
   ``You can't expect an abuser to miraculously be cured of all his
aggressions in a six-week program. It takes time to undo what years
of abuse have done,'' said Ludvigsen-Jennings. If the abuser is
caught early enough, his anger can be controlled. But the more
entrenched the pattern of violence, the greater the possibility it
won't be reversed.
   Spouse abuse is not, at its root, a marital problem _ it is an
anger problem, and even if the couple separates he will most likely
lash out again, she said. ``By not addressing the issue of learning
different ways of seeing one's self and the opposite sex (and) not
addressing the issue of what family violence does, we are dumping
more people into the criminal court system.''

<HEAD>In Silver And Gold Symbols, Craftman Signifies Faith</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Kerrville throughout in b0304 of March
14</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Laserphoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Down in the hill country of south Texas, a
craftsman with a fancy for symbolism pursues that ancient way of
conveying faith, expressing it in signs and images.
   They're myriad kinds _ a fish, circle, dove, Greek letters,
flames, a flower, anchor, crown, a cross.
   ``I had something I wanted to say that's important to me, and I
wanted to share it with others,'' says James Avery, 67, whose
company at Kerrville, Texas, turns out religiously symbolic jewelry.
   ``I know these things are strengthening to people,'' he said in a
telephone interview, telling of many letters received affirming it
and special requests for items in times of crisis.
   Pictorial art and symbols were _ until the 15th century invention
of the printing press _ the main representation for common people of
Christianity, registered in church sculptury, figures and mosaics.
   But in modern times, such indirect religious expression has
become less prominent, along with a shift away from decorative
churches, with the meaning of many symbols often not known.
   ``It's a sometimes forgotten, but powerful language,'' Avery said.
   However, his output of symbol-bearing pins, rings, pendants, key
chains, necklaces, bracelets, earrings and other items in silver and
gold has grown from a one-man shop in his garage to a $22
million-a-year business.
   It includes, besides his main design and hand-crafting center on
a tree-clad hillside at Kerrville, 22 retail stores, mostly in Texas
and Oklahoma, plus an extensive mail-order trade, and employs about
600 people.
   ``I didn't get into this to make money,'' he said, relating how
he turned to it at a stressful point in his own life to find a
simpler, more constructive way of living.
   At that time, the Milwaukee-born Avery, then a fine arts
professor at the University of Colorado, had been without religious
faith, his first marriage collapsed.
   ``It started me doing some pretty heavy thinking,'' he said. ``I
was trying to get back on a track with some values and that were
lasting.'' He returned to the Episcopal Church which he had
abandoned in his college days.
   Now a ``a very strong, committed Christian,'' he said:
   ``There is no help in us ourselves. It comes from the outside.
You can't stare at your navel and get it. It comes from without,
from God himself. That's where the healing and help comes from.''
   Settling in 1954 in Kerrville, northwest of San Antonio, he hung
a sign on his garage, ``James Avery Craftsman,'' the name of his
company ever since. He wasn't even sure then just what crafting he
would do.
   As a World War II Air Force bomber flier, while still an
agnositic, he had carried a charm given him by an African native who
said it would protect from ``boom, boom.'' He said he had prized it
then.
   Indirectly, it may have figured in his turning to crafting
religiously symbolic jewelry. At $2 an hour for his work, plus
materials, he took in only $5,500 the first year, but demand for his
pieces spread, mostly at first by word-of-mouth.
   Now bigtime, he said what mattered was the note of faith and
beauty in his pieces. ``This is where it's at. This is what living
is all about, what Christ was talking about, where freedom is.''
   His company's output includes 196 different types of Christian
crosses from various periods and areas of the world, plus many other
symbols. Each piece includes a card explaining the Scriptural or
historical meaning.
   Some symbols used in Avery's jewelry that aren't always clear
beforehand to people include:
   INRI _ Latin initials of inscription at the top of the cross at
the crucifixon, ``Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.''
   Butterfly _ eternal life; dove _ Holy Spirit; lily _ purity and
chastity; nail _ Christ's physical suffering; rose _ prophecy;
triangle _ the Trinity; crossed keys _ keys to heaven given to St.
Peter.
   Olive branch _ peace, God's reconciliation with man; shell _
baptism, recalling the scallop shell or scallop-shaped vessel used
in pouring baptismal water; lamb _ Jesus; anchor _ hope,
steadfastness.
   Chi Rho _ Greek initials of Christ, XP; circle _ eternity; flames
_ Holy Spirit, religious fervor, martyrdom; daisy _ Christ child,
innocence; grapes _Holy Communion; harp _ music glorifying God;
heart _ God's love.
   IHS _ first three Greek letters of Jesus, IHCOYC, but when Latin
became the main language, the Greek C was changed to a Latin S,
making the abbreviation IHS instead of IHC.
   Ichthus _ fish, in Greek, early symbol of Christ. Christianity
was an underground movement for its first 300 years, and Christians
would draw a fish as a secret sign of identity.

<HEAD>Old Port of Bremen Seeks Survival in High Technology</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BREMEN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Setting aside a 1,200-year tradition
of shipbuilding and trade, the hearty Germans who people this
blustery port are turning to high technology to survive the
withering of their waterfront.
   Undercut by Asians who can build ships and package fish much
cheaper, the heavily unionized shipyards and factories that were the
heartbeat of Bremen have suffered a steady decline for more than a
decade.
   The 15.5-percent unemployment rate borne by this stronghold of
sailors and stevedores is nearly twice the national average. It
marks Bremen as one of the bleak counterpoints to the economic
success stories in West Germany's south.
   Bremen's industrial and government leaders say the solution is a
complete personality change for the Hanseatic port that has been
focused on the sea since its founding in the 8th century.
   They see the city's future in the high-technology industries that
already have found a foothold among the wharves and drydocks on the
Weser River, about 35 miles inland from the North Sea.
   But even the most optimistic of Bremen's economic forecasters
concede that a radical reversal of the downward trend is unlikely.
   ``We have no room for expansion,'' Ortwin Baum, director of
Bremen's Association of Employers, said in an interview. ``That is
the great disadvantage we have in trying to compete with other
states for new business.''
   The city of Bremen, which under West Germany's maze-like
governmental structure also ranks as a state, is already chockablock
with factories, wharves and trim rows of postwar townhouses
accommodating the city's 540,000 residents.
   There are also the disincentives of high business taxes,
inadequate public transport, empty city coffers and a work force
with more back muscle than computer knowhow.
   Despite the heavy odds against a swift change from blue-collar to
white-collar industries, the outlook for the automobile, aviation
and space industries represented here holds a promise of enough
expansion to compensate for the further cutbacks expected in heavy
industry.
   While Bremen's economy may not get better soon, no one expects it
to get much worse.
   ``Bremen is reducing its dependence on classical old industries
like shipbuilding and fish-processing,'' said Uwe Beckmeyer,
Bremen's state minister for economics, technology and trade. ``The
resettlement of high-technology enterprises and research facilities
here will create 3,000 new jobs by the turn of the century.''
   Much of the expansion will be among the industrial giants like
Daimler-Benz, which produces Mercedes cars, and other high-tech
companies like Krupp Atlas Electronics and the
Messerschmidt-Boelkow-Blohm enterprise involved in air and space
transport production.
   ``It's true that Bremen is going to be seeing new work places
opening up in the high-technology fields, but I'm not convinced they
will be plentiful enough to counteract the losses in the marine
industries,'' said Dagmar Lill, head of state government's labor
department. ``We've seen about 20,000 jobs disappear in Bremen over
the past 10 years or so, and that has created a problem with
long-term unemployment that these new jobs will not resolve.''
   Local government and private organizations have been created over
the past few years to address Bremen's labor crisis, but Ms. Lill
says there is little hope of retraining the over-40 manual laborers
from the waterfront, who are the first laid off by the troubled
shipyards and steel mills, for the kinds of jobs that will be
available in the future.
   West German social security provides experienced workers who are
laid off with 68 percent of their previous salaries, which older and
unskilled workers often find sufficient to live on.
   About one-fourth of the jobless population is under 25, and the
younger unemployed stand a better chance of gaining entrance into
government-funded training programs than their elders who are often
content to stay on the government dole.
   Renee Seehof directs the 5-year-old Bremen Unemployed Self-Help
agency BRAS, which uses public funds to hire 200 young Bremens and
train them for the specialized positions expected to open in the
region.
   ``There are so many similar assistance groups in each
neighborhood and church and social agency that it's hard to believe
that those who want to learn a new trade can't find an opportunity
to do so,'' Ms. Seehof said.
   The sorry state of Bremen's finances has forced the closure of
some schools and other public services, triggering strikes and
encumbering more of the population with personal debts.
   The liberal Social Democrats have governed Bremen throughout the
postwar period and the conservative Christian Democrats, who govern
nationally, are under fire on grounds that they failed to rescue
Bremen.
   The turmoil thus has fueled the rise of a small but vocal
ultra-rightist faction in Bremen, which is the seat of West
Germany's largest radical right-wing organization, the combined
German National Democratic Party and the German Peoples Union.
   ``We will be running a full list of candidates in the next
elections (1990),'' the party's press spokesman, Karl-Heinz Vorsatz,
said. ``We can only expect even broader support when the economic
situation is as bad as it is.''

<HEAD>Big Political Names Recruited for 1990 Senate Races</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Big political names like Walter F. Mondale,
Pete du Pont and Lamar Alexander are attracting renewed attention as
party leaders try to recruit star-quality candidates in their
efforts to tip the balance in 1990 Senate races.
   Success in recruiting a Mondale, du Pont or Alexander could force
an otherwise safe incumbent into a tossup race for re-election.
   For example, if Democrats succeed in convincing Mondale to run
for the Senate, Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota would
shift from being a good bet for re-election to being an endangered
incumbent.
   The 1990 Senate elections also offer some tempting targets for
Republican recruiters looking for a chance to embarrass potential
1992 Democratic presidential contenders.
   High on that list was Sen. Sam Nunn of Georgia, the Democrat who
led the fight to defeat President Bush's nomination of John Tower to
be secretary of defense.
   ``It's about time we had a strong opponent against Mr. Nunn,''
said Lee Raudonis, executive director of the Georgia Republican
Party, a goal easier contemplated than achieved. Nunn received 80
percent of the vote in 1984 and 83 percent six years before that.
   Also on that list were Democrats Albert Gore Jr. of Tennessee,
Joseph Biden of Delaware and Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
   But the main focus in 1990 will be control of the Senate rather
than the White House.
   There is virtually no chance the Republicans can regain next year
the majority they lost in 1986. Democrats now control the Senate by
a margin of 55 to 45, and of the 33 seats contested next year, 17
are now held by Republicans and 16 by Democrats.
   Republican dreams of narrowing the Democratic hold on the Senate
were jolted this winter when two GOP incumbents regarded as sure
bets for re-election _ William Armstrong of Colorado and Gordon
Humphrey of New Hampshire _ announced they wouldn't run again.
   Three other Republicans considered possibilities to join the
ranks of voluntary retirements were Jesse Helms of North Carolina,
Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas and Mark Hatfield of Oregon.
   On the Democratic side, no incumbent is expected to step down
voluntarily.
   Ironically, Democratic efforts to recruit former North Carolina
Gov. Jim Hunt to run for the Senate could have the effect of
convincing Helms to seek another term.
   Helms beat back a challenge from Hunt in 1984, a contest that was
not only one of the most bitter in memory, but also still ranks as
the most expensive Senate race in history. Helms spent nearly $17
million and Hunt almost $10 million.
   Friends of Mondale describe the 1984 Democratic presidential
candidate as agonizing over whether to challenge Boschwitz, a
decision Mondale has said he would make this summer.
   The former vice president and senator is getting conflicting
advice from former aides, some of whom argue that a Boschwitz
challenge would be very expensive and difficult to win despite early
polls that give Mondale a nine-point lead. Others argue that Mondale
ought to run because he yearns to return to public service and they
are convinced that although the race would not be easy he would win.
   Basil Battaglia, the Delaware Republican chairman, said he has
talked to du Pont about challenging Biden.
   ``That would be a classic race,'' he said, while not sounding
optimistic that it will take place. Du Pont was a popular two-term
governor of Delaware and was an early contender for the 1988 GOP
presidential nomination.
   ``Pete has never been receptive to the United States Senate for
some reason,'' said Battaglia. ``He has always shied away from it.''
   In Tennessee, GOP party official Tommy Hopper was no more
optimistic about convincing former Gov. Lamar Alexander to take on
Gore.
   ``He probably wouldn't consider it,'' Hopper said of Alexander,
who now is president of the University of Tennessee.
   Was anyone else considering a Gore challenge?
   ``I don't know anybody who's looking at it,'' said Hopper.
   Greg Edwards, executive director of the New Jersey Republican
Party, couldn't name a high-visibility prospect to challenge
Democratic Sen. Bill Bradley.
   ``I have not been a party to any discussions about candidate
recruitment for the Senate race,'' he said. ``Nor have I heard of
any potentials mentioned.''
   Republicans may have better luck persuading Rep. Claudine
Schneider to run against veteran Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell of
Rhode Island. Schneider resisted attempts to get her to challenge
Pell in 1984 and is giving no hints what she might do this time.
   A Republican in the category of ``a shoo-in unless'' was Sen.
John Warner of Virginia. The only potential stumbling block in his
path was Gov. Gerald Baliles, whose term ends in January 1990.
   Despite the hunger Georgia Republicans have for seeing Nunn
forced to work for re-election, the prospects aren't high.
   ``There hasn't been a meeting of the long knives to go out and
try to find someone,'' said Raudonis when asked about the prospects
of a strong challenge to Nunn.
   He listed Mack Mattingly, the Republican who served one Senate
term and then was beaten for re-election in 1986 as ``a formidable
candidate.''
   ``I'm sure there are others around,'' said Raudonis. ``I just say
we haven't gone out and tried to find anybody yet.''

<HEAD>11 Years After: Detective Still Emotional about `Hillside Strangler'
Murders</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After more than a decade, former homicide
detective Bob Grogan still gets angry when he recalls the murders of
10 young women, the subject of the NBC movie ``The Case of the
Hillside Stranglers.''
   His Boston-Irish accent takes on an indignant tone as he
remembers the victims, whose nude and tortured bodies were abandoned
on hillsides in 1977-78, and their families.
   Grogan, whose investigation helped break the case, is portrayed
by Richard Crenna in the two-hour movie airing Sunday.
   Dennis Farina plays Angelo Buono, one of two men convicted of the
killings, and Billy Zale plays Kenneth Bianchi, the other. Steven
Gethers directed and wrote the screenplay based on the book ``Two of
a Kind: The Hillside Stranglers'' by Darcy O'Brien.
   The killers first struck in October 1977 and within a week had
claimed three victims. But the bodies were left in various places,
and the deaths were investigated by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department, Glendale police and Los Angeles police.
   It wasn't until two more bodies were found one weekend that a
connection was made.
   ``The following week, Ralph Salerno of the sheriff's department,
Roger Brown of Glendale and I began comparing notes,'' said Grogan.
``We were pretty well convinced they were all connected.''
   The key, Grogan said, was a tell-tale mark all the bodies had on
the neck, wrists and ankles.
   ``The marks were like a blueprint,'' he said. ``Thereafter
whenever a new body was found we could tell if it was connected by
the ligature marks.
   ``We began to suspect two people were involved after the murder
of Judy Miller. Her body appeared to have been lifted and placed,
rather than tossed and rolled.''
   The killing of Lauren Wagner produced a witness who had seen two
men stop her on a street outside her home.
   That's when Grogan and the other officers began to believe the
killers were either police officers or were posing as police
officers. ``The bodies had no defensive trauma,'' he said. ``There
was no evidence of a struggle, which indicated they had convinced
the girls to come along until it was too late.''
   The various police departments, under increasing public pressure
to solve the cases, organized a task force. Grogan believes the
addition of uniformed policemen with no investigative experience
impeded the case.
   ``The primary investigators had to withhold key evidence,'' he
said. ``Polygraph keys, we called them. Otherwise, it would have
been in the press in no time. We need these key points to separate
the real killers from the people confessing to the crimes. But,
because of that, the officers felt we didn't trust them.''
   Bianchi was arrested in Bellingham, Wash., for two murders there.
The link to the Hillside Strangler murders was quickly made. Grogan
makes a brief appearance in the movie as Bellingham Detective Fred
Nolte.
   Bianchi pleaded guilty to the two murders in Washington, with the
provision that the death penalty not be applied. He also pleaded
guilty to five murders in Los Angeles and became the primary witness
against Buono, his cousin.
   Grogan, a burly man with a red beard and moustache, becomes most
incensed when he recalls the preliminary hearing for Buono and the
subsequent trial.
   ``After a 10-month preliminary hearing, with 125 witnesses,
Deputy District Attorney Roger Kelly moved to dismiss all 10
charges,'' he said. ``He had the backing of District Attorney John
Van de Kamp (now California's attorney general). They didn't think
they could win a major case because of Kenneth Bianchi's credibility
as a witness.''
   Superior Court Judge Ronald George refused to dismiss the charges
and ordered California Attorney General George Deukmejian (now the
state's governor) to prosecute the case. Buono was convicted on all
counts and is now serving a life sentence at Soledad Prison. Since
the trial, George has become an appellate judge.
   Grogan has retired after 27 years with the Los Angeles police and
is now a private detective. He does not handle criminal cases.

<HEAD>USDA's Voyage to Seek Exotic Production Ideas Continues</HEAD>

   The Agriculture Department's search for
strange, new ways to help small farmers has resulted in suggestions
about production of exotic livestock, goats, herbs, wildflowers,
mushrooms and other specialties.
   The latest reports from the Office for Small-Scale Agriculture,
which is part of the Cooperative State Research Service, are about
exotic fruits and so-called dessert vines.
   Editor George B. Holcomb is the author of the one-sheet reports,
which bear the general title, ``A Small-Scale Agriculture
Alternative.'' In other words, each one offers potential
opportunities for small farmers. Some could lead to big returns. No
guarantees, though, and there are pitfalls.
   Here's what the report on exotic fruits has to say:
   ``Certain potentially high-demand tropical or other exotic fruits
growing in Florida or California also have varieties that will bear
fruit farther north. But potential small-scale northern enterprisers
should not buy seeds or seedlings from anyone until checking them
out carefully with a horticulturist at their county or state
extension office.''
   The growing demand for specialty fruits in most large cities
means that skilled small producers may be able to compete with the
big operators from New Zealand, Central America and South America.
   But that can be done only if growers select varieties carefully
and master their marketing homework.
   One of the possibilities is the kiwi fruit, a native of New
Zealand that has caught on with many American consumers since it was
introduced in the early 1960s. California and Florida are the
centers of U.S. kiwi production, but there are some experiments with
hardier varieties from South Carolina on west.
   ``While some fruits do well in one state and not in another, a
few, like the feijoa, a native of South America, have also been
adopted successfully by New Zealanders, Floridians and
Californians,'' the report said. ``With some protection, it too can
be cultivated farther to the north; but, according to the latest
reports, it hasn't, possibly because damaging fruit flies love it
so.''
   The report lists names and addresses for specific marketing
information about exotic fruit production.
   In the second new report about dessert vines, the watermelon and
its cousins come into full glory with types and varieties that
grocery shoppers perhaps never dreamed of a few years ago.
   New disease-resistant watermelons, for example, open up new
possibilities for small-scale entrepreneurs who want to produce them
for local markets.
   ``It could mean a comeback for watermelons, which were consumed
at the rate of about 17.9 pounds per capita in the 1950s,'' the
report said. ``The rate dropped to only 12.8 pounds in the 1970s.''
   The new assortment of hardier watermelons includes the
miniatures, the ``icebox'' melon that weighs 5 to 10 pounds. Also,
hybrids are being produced without seeds, with some of these melons
averaging about 15 pounds.
   ``Growers say that besides their resistance to the common
diseases of anthracnose and fusarium wilt, mini-melons are firmer,
crisper and sweeter than other watermelons,'' the report said.
``Whether size gives them a marketing advantage over their 20- to
25-pound cousins is a queston.''
   The report added: ``Supermarket dealers can make more money per
melon by selling slices of large melons. The small ones average more
rind per pound than the big ones. But the new mini-melons reportedly
hold up well in shipping, even without refrigeration.''
   Another dessert vine is the cantaloupe, which are grown in many
parts of the country. And there are some varieties that will do
better than others, depending on location and other climatic factors.
   ``County extension agents may give tips on marketing, but they
can't provide the extra labor that may be needed if a grower plants
more than his family and available laborers can harvest, haul and
sell,'' the report said.
   In some cases pick-your-own operations can be adapted to
cantaloupe production, and there are ways to design and improve
roadside direct marketing. Sources of such information are provided
in the report.

``Dessert Vines'' _ write to: Howard W. Kerr Jr., Program Director,

<HEAD>Breathing Life Into Old Movies</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Academy Award might be the most sought-after
prize in the movie world, but even Oscar _ or an Oscar nomination _
hasn't been able to save some old movies from fading away.

   ``Gone Wih the Wind'' looks better than ever.
``Lawrence of Arabia'' is a feast for the eyes. The new print of
``Casablanca'' has hardly a scratch.
   But the rerelease of those Academy Award-winning classics has
overshadowed the fact that thousands of old films are in need of
restoration or are damaged beyond repair.
   Curators from the nation's four major preservation centers agree
that quick and comprehensive action is needed. They also see another
problem emerging over the next few years: the fading of color films.
   The original negative of ``Stagecoach,'' the 1939 John Ford
Western that made John Wayne a star, no longer exists, and only
inferior copies are available. The same is true of the 1937 Cary
Grant-Irene Dunne comedy, ``The Awful Truth,'' which earned an Oscar
for director Leo McCarey. And the master of ``Double Indemnity,''
Billy Wilder's 1944 landmark film noir, is incomplete. It was
nominated for best picture but lost to another McCarey production,
``Going My Way.''
   Until 1950, movies were printed on nitrate stock, a highly
flammable material that decomposes almost instantly, and without
proper care can disintegrate within a few years. But when the
negatives are transferred to acetate, known as ``safety stock,''
they can have a shelf life of 100 years or more if kept under
climate-controlled conditions.
   ``I think with over 110 million feet of nitrate film held in the
nation's archives that are either unique copies or the best
surviving ones, we are very close to confronting a crisis,'' said
Robert Rosen, director of UCLA's Film and Television Archives. ``All
of this material, unless it's copied, is going to be gone.''
   Peter Williamson, preservation officer at the Museum of Modern
Art in New York, cited other major problems: ``We need additional
funding because our funding levels have basically been frozen at a
fixed dollar amount for the last 10 years,'' he said. ``Also, the
laboratory capacity to correctly duplicate for preservation has
undergone a dramatic shrinking. Fifteen years ago there were at
least two dozen laboratories, now we're down to six or seven.''
   Switching from one stock to the other costs the preservation
centers 40-60 cents per foot, double the rate of 10 years ago.
Meanwhile, federal funding has stayed at $500,000 during that time.
And with the government operating under a large budget deficit, the
prospects for increased revenues in the near future are dim.
   ``I'm going to shoot for the same kind of funding that I had this
year,'' said Rep. Sidney Yates, D-Ill., a major supporter of film
preservation and a member of the House subcommittee on Interior and
Related Agencies.
   ``I don't think there's a possibility of getting a real major
increase of funding for any program under the current fiscal
climate. If perhaps we can get an inflation recognition (an increase
at the rate of inflation), we will have been doing pretty well.''
   But even with financial assistance, curators see another problem
emerging over the next few years: the fading of color films.
According to Paul Spehr, the assistant chief of the Library of
Congress' Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division,
the negatives for early color films have a shelf life of 30-40 years
and can be extended by cold storage.
   Since color first had widespread use in the '50s, many original
negatives are now ready to be transferred to the current, more
durable stock.
   ``Most of the colors fade very badly,'' Spehr said. ``We're at
the point now where it's beginning to see a crunch.''
   Moving pictures first became popular at the turn of the century
when people poured into nickelodeons, and for 5 cents could watch
images flicker by. By the '20s, such stars as Charlie Chaplin and
Mary Pickford had helped make motion pictures a major industry. But
no one really thought those movies were worth saving.
   According to Williamson, less than one-third of all silent movies
remain. The films of actress Theda Bara, a major star from the
silent era, have almost completely vanished.
   ``We have 12 to 15 million feet of nitrate and only about a third
of that is preserved,'' said Ed Stratmann, the assistant curator in
charge of preservation at the George Eastman House in Rochester,
N.Y. ``Time is running out for it.''
   Movie studios have received mixed grades for their efforts in
transferring stock. Curators praised Turner Entertainment, which
controls MGM, RKO and pre-1949 Warner Bros. films, and Walt Disney
Studios for maintaining their libraries.
   Ted Turner, chairman and chief executive officer of Turner
Broadcasting Systems Inc., outraged the film community by colorizing
``The Maltese Falcon,'' ``It's a Wonderful Life'' and other
classics. However, his company has done extensive restoration,
including the heavily-publicized ``Gone With the Wind'' project.

   According to Dick May, Turner's director of film services, the
entire MGM catalog _ about 1,000 movies _ has been transferred to
safety, including 1938's ``The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' which was
in danger of being lost forever.
   ``There was no protection. The safety negative wore out from use.
We had to go back to the original nitrate material,'' May said.
   Disney has recently reissued the much-loved animated movies,
``Bambi'' and ``Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' and is currently
at work on a new print of ``Fantasia.''
   ``We have in addition to the negative material, the original
artwork,'' said Paula Sigman, assistant archivist at the Disney Co.
``If we want to do something special, we can go back to the
original-release versions. All that material has been preserved.''
   MCA, which controls the Universal and pre-1948 Paramount
libraries, has been less thorough. Two early Marx Brothers films,
``The Cocoanuts'' and ``Horse Feathers,'' are available only in
badly scratched versions. ``Double Indemnity'' is also a Paramount
movie.
   ``It's not like there are any titles that have been lost because
the nagative is incomplete, but as far as what the quality would be,
there's no way of saying,'' said John Previti, who supervises
preservation of old Universal and Paramount titles. ``The longer you
wait, the more of a risk there is. All this nitrate has been sitting
in the vault for years.''
   Spehr was also less than satisfied with Universal's library.
   ``We certainly don't have a full representation of their film
production. Some films ... are in very bad shape. They don't have
the snap and sharpness you would like to see.''
   But all the dire predictions have produced a positive side
effect: an increased awareness of the importance of preservation.
   Projects are underway throughout the United States: The Library
of Congress is currently restoring the films of Frank Capra; Turner
is at work on the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musicals; UCLA has
discovered a series of Laurel and Hardy films in Spanish; and the
American Film Institute is putting together a comprehensive data
base with information on all available prints and where the
negatives can be found.
   ``We're working with the other archives in trying to pool a few
things,'' said Stratmann, who noted that the Eastman House, the
Museum of Modern Art and Turner are collaborating on the restoration
of the 1944 musical, ``Meet Me in St. Louis.''
   Spehr is encouraged, too: ``One of the things that's interesting
is we detect a much stronger and broader interest in preservation in
general. More interests are being expressed from a wider variety of
sources.''
   For Rosen, restoring old films goes beyond any entertainment
value the movies might provide. He sees it as a way of preserving
history.
   ``For the 20th century, the moving image is in a real sense our
collective memory,'' he said. ``It's the popular art form most
characteristic of our century. It's a way people measure their own
lives.''

   A campaign to preserve the remaining half of the
world's tropical rain forests has finally taken root, but the task
is enormous and the last gasp for the ``lungs of the Earth'' could
be less than a century away.
   Environmentalists are pleased with their initial success three
years after they began challenging governments, industries and
banks. But an area the size of a soccer field is destroyed each
minute, and the young preservation movement seeks fundamental
changes in political, economic and social structures to save the
teeming jungles of South America, Africa and Southeast Asia.
   An aggressive campaign of publicity, education and confrontation
began in 1985 and appeared to capture the world's attention last
year. Almost overnight, it seemed, world leaders began calling for
greater efforts to halt the chopping and burning of rain forests.
Conferences discussed such technical conservation issues as
``sustainable management.'' Rock stars Sting and The Grateful Dead
played benefit concerts for the cause. Media coverage increased.
   Some recent fruits of that effort:
   _Brazil in October announced suspension of tax benefits for
landowners who destroy the Amazon rain forest, the largest and
fastest-disappearing on Earth.
   _The International Tropical Timber Organization approved a $4
million project in northern Brazil that calls for loggers to consult
with environmental groups, government agencies, native Indians and
local workers to plan long-term forest development and preservation.
   _Some 500 Brazilian Indians from 20 tribes gathered last month to
oppose planned hydroelectric dams in the Amazon that could flood
rain forest areas, including their homes. The meeting was the first
by the tribes, which traditionally have battled over territory and
remained isolated.
   _Thailand imposed a nationwide logging ban after
environmentalists blamed uncontrolled timber harvesting for floods
that killed more than 350 people in November. Last April, officials
suspended plans for a hydroelectric dam that environmentalists said
would have ruined Thailand's last virgin rain forest.
   _West Germany earmarked about $80 million for saving tropical
forests.
   ``Without a coherent strategy for protecting the tropical forests
in which everyone concerned participates, we cannot master the vast
problems threatening the future of all mankind,'' said West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   ``We have to be ambitious. We're in trouble,'' said Randall
Hayes, head of the U.S.-based Rainforest Action Network. ``If we
don't get the changes we need in the next five years, then we've
lost the rain forests.''
   The results could be catastrophic.
   Rain forests cover some 2.4 billion acres of the planet, about
half the original amount, ecologists say.
   Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' they act as a
pollution filter, absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. If
carbon dioxide isn't removed from the atmosphere, it can trap heat,
which some scientists say causes a global warming trend called the
greenhouse effect. Burning the rain forests, a common way to create
arable land, also adds carbon to the atmosphere.
   Rain forests are storehouses of plant, insect and animal species,
some of which could prove useful for drugs and other scientific
endeavors. Scientists say only a small percentage of the 5 million
species in the forests, many of them unique to the tropical
environment, have been studied.
   In addition, 200 million people live in and around rain forests,
including indigenous tribes who depend on them for sustenance and
shelter.
   Nonetheless, preservation presents complexities that cut across
social and political boundaries. Many rain forests are in developing
countries that need to capitalize on their natural resources and
must borrow money for costly modernization projects, such as
highways and power plants.
   Brazil, for example, has the developing world's largest foreign
debt at $115 billion. Two of its limited number of export products
are beef and timber _industries that cause major forest destruction.
Cattle ranchers burn forests to create grazing land; loggers clear
jungle in search of exotic hardwoods.
   Meanwhile, poor farmers burn small tracts to grow crops. The
soil, so fertile under the rain forest canopy, is then leached of
nutrients in seasonal heavy rains, forcing farmers to move on and
burn another patch every few years.
   Last fall, Brazilian President Jose Sarney suspended tax benefits
for land developers and banned exports of unprocessed tropical
timber. ``We must create nationwide consciousness that we are all
passengers in the adventure of man on Earth. The era of unlimited
natural resources is over,'' he said.
   But environmentalists contend the harmful practices continue.
Now, Brazil is balking at proposals to swap some of its foreign debt
for saving parcels of rain forest. Such plans would entail creation
of an international commission to watch over the preserved jungle.
   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park for
humanity,'' Brazil's foreign minister, Roberto de Abreu Sodre, said.
``Our priority is economic development. We're open to international
suggestions, but not those that interfere in Brazilian sovereignty.''
   Industrial giants such as the United States and European
countries, which have little or no rain forest, have been the most
vocal about the developing nations' efforts to halt the destruction.
That causes particular resentment.
   A conference of eight nations in the Amazon region, including
Brazil, earlier this month issued a declaration rejecting foreign
interference while saying development must preserve the environment
and wild resources.
   ``Part of the problem is that it's coming down to the developed
countries versus the developing countries,'' said a U.S. activist
who monitors the World Bank, the largest source of aid to developing
nations.
   ``They (developing countries) say, `You raped your countries to
get developed, and now you're stopping us from doing it,''' said the
activist, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
   But N.F. Potter, Canada's executive director at the 151-nation
World Bank, said: ``There are ways of doing things without making
the same mistakes.''
   The World Bank has been criticized by environmentalists, who say
it ignores ecological issues when funding projects. At issue are
billions of dollars; in the fiscal year ending June 30, the bank
expects to loan a record $21 billion.
   ``These bankers are unbelievably ignorant. They are absolutely
reckless,'' said Brent Blackwelder of the U.S.-based Environmental
Policy Institute.
   Under increasing pressure from member nations and environmental
groups not to fund ecologically harmful projects, the bank set up a
department in 1987 to assess the potential damage of development
projects.
   ``You can see a lot more environmental consciousness than there
was two years ago,'' said an official with a U.S. agency that
monitors aid. ``There has been movement. I'm not saying there has
been all the movement necessary.''

   Environmentalists also have accused some nations, especially
Japan, of funding projects with no regard for environmental issues.
   For example, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, formerly the World
Wildlife Fund, claims Japan has helped finance hydroelectric dams in
Brazil that will flood rain forest so it can buy logs from the land
to be flooded _ thus circumventing Brazil's ban on unprocessed
timber exports.
   Motokatsu Watanabe, a Japanese Foreign Ministry officer, said
Japan's private sector has not recognized the danger of
deforestation. A government goal was to increase public awareness,
he said.
   World Bank environmentalists say Japan has improved its record
recently by supporting research and increasing contributions to
organizations.
   In the Asian and African forests, logging has caused the most
destruction. Environmentalists say that rather than selectively
logging valuable woods for trade, the timber industry destroys large
tracts in search of exotic woods.
   The wholescale logging leads to flooding from rainwater that runs
over the barren land instead of being absorbed by foliage. It also
displaces native populations, creating conflicts between developers
and locals.
   In Malaysia, members of the Penans, the last known tribe of
nomadic hunters and gatherers on the north coast of Borneo, have
repeatedly obstructed logging roads in Sarawak state. Officials say
more than 80 Penans have been detained in recent months;
environmentalists put the figure at well above 100.
   The Penans began the campaign two years ago to protect hunting
grounds. They complain they are not recognized as owners of their
ancestral lands.
   The Amazon Indians who gathered in Brazil have similar concerns.
   While governments say they will offer programs to resettle the
Indians, environmentalists call for ``sustainable management'' _
conservation efforts that yield rain forest resources while
preserving the Indian homelands. They say such conservation is
practiced in less than 1 percent of all rain forest.
   An example of sustainable management is selective harvesting, in
which rows of trees are cut instead of whole sections of forest. The
forest can then regenerate under the remaining canopy.
   Such policies were the goal of Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, an
Amazon ecologist. Mendes, 44, was shot to death outside his home in
December while under police protection from death threats. Four
people have been arrested, including members of a powerful ranching
family that wanted to convert rain forest to grazing land.

   Experts had warned for years that
uncontrolled logging and clearing in Asian rain forests could lead
to disaster. The warnings went unheeded until November's rains
brought floods and mudslides to Thailand.
   More than 350 people were killed, including scores in the
worst-hit area, Nakhon Sri Thammarat, as mud and felled trees rolled
down hillsides and buried entire villages. Environmentalists blamed
loggers, who blamed farmers they said moved illegally into steep
forests and burned away trees to plant crops.
   The government in January banned logging on 38.4 million acres.
   Regardless of who's to blame, government spoksman Charnchai
Chairungrueng said Thailand's virgin forest has dwindled from 43
percent of the nation's land cover in 1972 to 27 percent.
Environmentalists say it's more like 20 percent.
   About 25 percent of the world's remaining tropical forests are in
Southeast Asia _ 65 percent in Indonesia. The rest are spread among
Malaysia, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and the
Philippines.
   In 1982, an international meeting of conservation groups in Bali
heard that rain forest loss had caused floods in India and drought
in Indonesia, clogged Thailand's traditional waterway support
system, devastated Haitian farms and reduced efficiency of
hydroelectric systems in the Philippines.
   Measures to reduce deforestation are promised in Indonesia, the
world's largest supplier of tropical wood, but the chainsaws cut as
much as ever.
   Hasjrul Harahap, Indonesia's forestry minister, said at least
1.24 million acres are destroyed each year in his country. Only
about 100,000 acres a year are being reforested. Harahap blamed a
``lack of discipline among those holding forest concessions'' for
the destruction. Most of the 544 concession holders are retired
military officers or former government officials.
   Environmentalists say 133 million acres have been lost over 20
years. In addition to logging, other factors are mining, nomadic
farmers and resettlement of millions of ``transmigrants'' from Java
to clear forests on other islands.
   Indonesia banned export of raw logs in 1985 to help the forests
recover and force the manufacture of plywood and other finished
products. Scores of plywood mills opened as expected, creating badly
needed jobs _ but increasing logging.
   Selective logging rules require that only trees of more than 20
inches in diameter be cut. But timber firms have logged over a wider
area to find enough of the larger trees, destroying many others in
the process.
   Timber companies are supposed to pay into a reforestation fund
for every tree felled, but the Forest Conservation Network of
Indonesia says there has never been a proper accounting of the fund.
   Malaysia, the leading exporter of raw logs, ships them from
Borneo Island's Sabah and Sarawak states. Environmentalists say the
timber harvesting rate in Sabah is four times that of natural
regeneration. Logging comprises 13 percent of the gross national
product, and Malaysia exported $1.6 billion worth of logs and sawed
wood in 1987.
   Malaysia also is sensitive to charges that logging in Sarawak
displaces the Penans, the last known tribe of nomadic hunters on
Borneo's north coast. The Penans started blocking logging roads in
April 1987 to protest the cutting of tropical hardwoods that provide
a canopy for their highland hunting grounds.
   Penans claim they are not recognized as owners of their
traditional lands, which were handed down by earlier generations.
Officials say 81 have been arrested this year; environmentalists put
the figure above 100.
   Kuala Lumpur vigorously defends its logging policy and denounces
critics. Protests last year at nine Malaysian diplomatic missions
were dismissed by Foreign Ministry Secretary-General Yusof Hitam as
attempts ``to sabotage the country for political reasons.''
   Environmentalists accuse Japan, the world's biggest consumer of
tropical timber, of wasting it on items like chopsticks that could
be made from other timber or non-timber materials.
   Late last year, Japan began obtaining raw wood from Brazilian
forests. The Worldwide Fund for Nature said that would undercut
trade with countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, forcing them to
slash prices.
   Motokatsu Watanabe, a Japanese Foreign Ministry officer, said the
private sector in Japan has not recognized the danger of
deforestation. A major goal for the government, he said, is to
increase public awareness.
   The timber trade in the Philippines has fallen and officials in
Manila blame runaway logging for shrinking forests. The Department
of Environmental and Natural Resources estimated only 3 million
acres of virgin forests remained of the 40.4 million acres in the
1940s.

   International pressure is mounting
on Brazil to preserve its fast-disappearing Amazon rain forest, but
the debt-ridden South American nation continues to resist what it
considers to be foreign meddling.
   There is growing concern worldwide that destruction of the 2
million-square-mile rain forest, the world's largest and
fastest-disappearing, could change global weather with potentially
disastrous consequences.
   Satellite photos of the Amazon show that in the past 10 years, an
area the size of Belgium has been slashed, burned and mined away.
About 9 percent of the region is irreparably damaged, said
researcher Philip M. Fearnside.
   But ecologists charge that the government has done little to
discourage uncontrolled destruction.
   In January, a U.S. congressional delegation led by Sen. Timothy
Wirth, D-Colo., met with President Jose Sarney to discuss swapping
part of Brazil's $115 billion debt for preserving Amazon land.
France and the Netherlands have made similar proposals, involving
creating an international commission to oversee the forest that
covers two-thirds of Brazil and is home to 15 million people.
   All received the same answer _ Brazil won't be told what to do.
   ``We can't turn the Amazon into a sort of national park for
humanity. Our priority is economic development. We're open to
international suggestions but not those that interfere in Brazilian
sovereignty,'' Foreign Minister Roberto de Abreu Sodre said recently.
   ``We can't be condemned to having a large part of our territory
prevented from being developed, particularly when the developed
world is responsible for the world's greatest ecological
disasters,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Paulo Tarso Flecha de Lima.
   Over the past two decades, the government has given cattle
ranchers tax breaks and other indirect subsidies totaling about $2
billion, even though studies show most of the Amazon is unsuited to
ranching or farming.
   The tropical soil is extremely fragile. When the protective
forest canopy is burned, nutrients wash away in the heavy rains.
   ``A typical field won't stand more than two crops, and a cattle
pasture lasts not more than a decade,'' said Fearnside, a professor
at the Amazonia Research Institute in Manaus, the principal Amazon
city. ``Only about 15 percent of the Amazon soil is suitable for
conventional farming.''
   In addition, much of the land has been cleared and burned by
farmers and by land speculators hoping for a better price for
homesteaded property, he said.
   Satellite photos of thousands of fires set by farmers and
developers drew world attention last year, as did the December
slaying of internationally known ecologist Francisco ``Chico''
Mendes.
   The leader of a local rubber tappers union, Mendes fought to keep
ranchers from cutting down the jungle for pasture. He had called for
more harvesting of Amazon resources such as nuts, latex and plants,
while preserving the trees.
   Four people, including the son of a rancher, have been arrested.
   In a nation where 60 percent of the people survive on less than
$90 a month, ecologists and politicians argue that the Amazon has
not created enough jobs to justify the destruction and its future
consequences.
   ``The idea that you tear down the rain forest to create jobs is
not sound,'' Wirth said. ``To send a lot of people out there to
settle the Amazon just doesn't work.''
   In the 1920s, auto magnate Henry Ford failed in a scheme to
cultivate rubber trees in a vast area now known as ``Fordlandia.''
Decades later, in the 1960s and '70s, shipping magnate Daniel Ludwig
lost a reported $1 billion in an ambitious plan to produce wood pulp
and rice on the Amazon's Jari River.
   ``Vast areas of the Amazon have been devastated and the poverty
is no less,'' said Artur Virgilio, mayor of Manaus. ``Only the
wealthy have so far benefited from the destruction.''
   Foreign groups have said they would pressure international
financial institutions not to release new funding for Amazon-related
projects. The World Bank, which has loaned Brazil $15 billion since
1949 for energy-related and development projects, is a principal
target.
   For example, environmental groups have urged the World Bank to
reject a $500 million loan that would help Brazil refinance some
debt from construction of dams and power plants. They say Brazil
would use some of the money for new projects instead of for
balancing payments on other loans.
   But this month, Brazil and the World Bank announced a proposed $1
billion loan for electric power development. Details of the proposed
loan, to be spread out over 18 months, were not disclosed pending
further negotiations.

<TEXT>
   Tropical rain forests are among the last ecosystems on Earth
virtually unchanged since prehistoric times and largely unexplored
by modern man.
   Here are some facts:
   _Rain forests cover about 2.4 billion acres, mostly in South
America, Africa and Southeast Asia. Environmentalists say about half
the original rain forest has been destroyed and at the current pace,
it all will be gone or severely degraded within a century.
   _Some 5 million species of plants, animals and insects live in
the rain forests, many unique to the tropical environment with
possible untold benefits to science, agriculture and medicine.
Scientists believe only a small percentage of these have been
studied.
   _Sometimes called the ``lungs of the Earth,'' rain forests act as
a pollution filter by absorbing carbon dioxide from power plants,
automobiles and fires and producing oxygen. In that way, some
scientists say, they help reduce the so-called greenhouse effect, a
gradual warming of the Earth because excess carbon dioxide and
pollutants in the atmosphere trap the sun's heat. A major source of
carbon in the atmosphere is from the widespread burning of rain
forest, a common method of clearing it for farming.
   _An estimated 200 million people live in and around rain forests,
including indigenous tribes that depend on the jungles for
sustenance and shelter. When displaced, the natives become unskilled
laborers in countries already struggling to develop socially and
economically.

   The deficit in the broadest measure of American
trade improved dramatically last year, narrowing to $135.3 billion,
as a surge in merchandise exports was enough to offset a sharp
worsening in the U.S. investment balance sheet, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the deficit in the current
account shrank 12.1 percent in 1988 after hitting an all-time high
of $153.96 billion in 1987.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and other

to determine the scope of an apparent cyanide poisoning attempt.
   Meanwhile, FDA Commissioner Frank Young advised Americans Tuesday
to be ``safe rather than sorry'' by discarding all fruit in their
refrigerator unless they are certain it was grown somewhere other
than Chile.
   The FDA on Monday announced that traces of cyanide had been found

   Eastern Airlines pilots are caught in a Catch 22.
   The fliers could easily find jobs at other carriers, thanks to a
shortage of commercial pilots stemming from airline deregulation and
explosive growth in passenger traffic, many experts say.
   But leaving strikebound Eastern requires them to sacrifice
seniority and accept lower pay and benefits.
   For Eastern's management, the pilot shortage could make it even
more difficult to replace the 3,600 pilots at the carrier, experts
said Tuesday.
   In order to attract new pilots, Eastern would have to offer
competitive salaries and quick promotions _ and it would need lots
of time to do so, said Peter Cappelli, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and the University of California at
Berkeley who studies airline labor relations.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami declined to comment on
the issue.
   Eastern's pilots earn an average of $70,000 to $85,000 a year.
Average pilot wages at healthy carriers such as United Airlines and
Delta Air Lines are higher _ pilots pull in as much as $167,000 at
the highest seniority levels.
   Observers also say the rock-bottom morale at Eastern, where
employees' anger toward boss Frank Lorenzo has reached fever pitch,
compounds the difficulty of luring replacement pilots. The carrier,
which has been crippled by the Machinists strike since March 4,
filed for protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy law
Thursday.
   One airline industry executive who asked not to be identified
admitted that the low morale at Eastern and the support of pilots at
other carriers for their colleagues at Eastern and against Lorenzo
would make it tough to replace the rebellious fliers.
   That solidarity was demonstrated Tuesday, when the executive
board of the Air Line Pilots Association announced it had authorized
strike benefit payments of $2,400 a month plus interest-free loans
for every Eastern pilot honoring the Machinists' picket lines.
   ``Today there really is a shortage'' of pilots, said Mark Kahn,
professor emeritus of economics at Wayne State University in
Detroit. Airline deregulation and growth in demand, plus a shrinking
of the traditional source of pilots _ the military _ have
contributed to this trend, experts say.
   Kit Darby, executive vice president of Future Aviation
Professionals of America in Atlanta, calls the job market for pilots
``extremely good.''
   Some airline executives say there is no pilot shortage.
   ``I am not aware of any of my member carriers having trouble
hiring qualified pilots,'' said Jerrold Glass, vice president of the
Airline Industrial Relations Conference, an airline trade
association focused on labor relations.
   If there actually is a nationwide pilot shortage, it would be
only a mixed blessing for Eastern's captains. They have highly
marketable skills but are hostages of the seniority system, forced
to start at the bottom of the ladder if they move to other airlines.
   Before the Machinists strike, Eastern pilots were deserting the
ailing carrier at the rate of about 500 a year, according to ALPA.
Some of them had as many as 20 years' seniority, the pilots union
says.
   Many of them went to work for healthier carriers such as American
Airlines, Northwest Airlines, USAir, Piedmont, United Parcel Service
and Federal Express, said Daniel Vician, vice chairman of the master
executive council of Eastern's ALPA branch.
   Some of the more experienced pilots who left Eastern saw their
salaries cut from about $5,833 a month to $1,800 a month, Vician
said.
   ``I think we're beginning to look at'' other jobs, Eastern pilot
Vince Garland said recently as he walked a picket line at Atlanta's
Hartsfield International Airport.
   Garland, 40, who's flown for Eastern for 10{ years, said he's
been told he would have to take a 60 percent pay cut to move to a
competitor.

   Japan's Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd.
has named an American as second-in-command of its U.S. operations,
but observers say it may be years before big Japanese companies put
an American in their top U.S. post.
   Richard A. Kraft, 60, was named Tuesday as president and chief
operating officer of Matsushita Electric Corporation of America, the
U.S. arm of the world's biggest consumer electronics company.
   Kraft is a 15-year veteran of the company, which sells products
under the Panasonic, Technics and Quasar brand names. He has served
as president of Matsushita Industrial Co. of Franklin Park, Ill.,
Matsushita's U.S. manufacturing division, since 1979.
   Kraft will run day-to-day operations under Akiya Imura, 54, who
will continue as chief executive of the U.S. company, based in
Secaucus, N.J., and assume the new title of chairman. The changes
take effect April 1.
   American companies are much more likely than Japanese companies
to give their top jobs overseas to foreign nationals. For example,
International Business Machines Corp. spokesman Peter Thonis said
IBM does business in 130 foreign countries and has Americans in
charge at fewer than five of them.
   In contrast, the chairman of Sony Corp. of America is Masaaki
Morita, younger brother of Sony co-founder Akio Morita. The U.S.
operations of Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd. and the biggest Japanese
banks and brokerage houses all are headed by Japanese as well.
   ``When push comes to shove, Japanese and Americans are not on the
same (promotion) track,'' said Richard Ozaroff, an analyst who
follows Japanese companies. ``For all the claims that they are
multinational companies that just happen to be based in Japan, I
don't buy it.''
   Matsushita has been striving to achieve a reputation as a good
corporate citizen in the United States by promoting Americans and
building U.S. factories.
   The company's image suffered a setback in January when its
Panasonic Co. unit agreed to pay consumers $16 million to avoid New
York state charges that it fixed retail prices on electronics
products.
   While the company maintains its innocence, some analysts said the
unfavorable publicity may have added urgency to promoting an
American to a top job as an image-building move.
   Matsushita has more than 7,000 employees in the United States,
scattered from Hawaii to California, Illinois, Washington, Tennessee
and New Jersey. It sells televisions, videocassette recorders,
microwave ovens and other products. It also sells business and
industrial equipment.
   Kraft said that as an American he could be more effective than
his predecessors in dealing with American employees, government
bodies and communities where Matsushita has operations.
   ``The American public today seems to be ambivalent about foreign
companies in the United States,'' Kraft said. By building
Matsushita's reputation, he said, ``We can ultimately overcome any
possible friction and be welcome in this country.''
   Matsushita, which had $38.5 billion in sales last year, has 102
companies in 37 countries outside Japan. Thirty of the companies in
14 countries already were headed by non-Japanese, and Imura said
picking an American to be president of the U.S. operations had been
a high priority for him in his two-year stint as president.
   Kraft said he understands the Japanese attitude of caution about
promoting an American to the top job.
   ``I think it's only natural that the company would be
conservative about turning over that kind of power until they had
developed the confidence in the person enough to be comfortable,''
he said.
   Could Kraft ever get the top job in Matsushita's U.S. company?
``This is America. Anything is possible. It certainly could happen.
I would just be overjoyed if I could develop that kind of
confidence,'' he said. ``Whether it will happen in my lifetime or
not, I don't know.''
   Kraft, a Chicago native, holds 13 U.S. patents as inventor or
co-inventor of electronics related to television.

<TEXT>
   The strike against
Eastern Airlines is costing the U.S. Virgin Islands about $5 million
a week and has cut short the heavy tourist season by nearly a month,
a Hotel Association spokesman said Tuesday.
   Tom Bennett, spokesman for the St. Thomas-St. John Hotel
Association, said the loss of 35 Eastern flights every week has
translated into about 6,200 fewer tourists per week.
   The situation was aggravated when Flyfare, one of the largest
travel agents dealing with the Caribbean, filed for bankruptcy.
Flyfare dealt almost exclusively with Eastern, Bennet said.
   ``We're certainly looking at a very serious time for the entire
economy,'' he said.
   ``We are doing what we can to make it as easy as possible for
Eastern to come back in or to assist other existing carriers to
increase their flights or to welcome a new carrier into the
islands,'' he added.
   Bennett also said negotiations were under way with the Caribbean
Hotel Association to fill the void left by Flyfare.
   While the hotel association and the Virgin Islands government
were moving to increase flights with other carriers and to seek the
aid of the Caribbean Hotel Association, losses through Tuesday
topped $5 million, he said.
   ``We've lost the lift of about 6,000 people and according to
statistics from the Division of Tourism, that calculates to be a
loss of $5 million a week,'' Bennett said.
   The figure includes $500,000 in various taxes lost to the local
government, which earns millions from the more than $600 million
generated annually by 2 million visitors, he said.
   ``Each week that this continues you are going to see that
happening,'' Bennett said. ``I think for all intents and purposes
the tourist season has come to an abrupt halt.''
   In addition, the 62 hotels and guest houses that are members of
the association are reporting sharp drops in occupancy this month,
Bennett said.
   ``Those hotels that were enjoying nearly full houses at the
beginning of March are now looking at 60 and 70 percent occupancy,''
the hotel association spokesman said.
   In addition, Bennett said, the impact is being felt among
seasonal hotel employees, who are working shorter hours and are
being laid off a month ahead of schedule.

   Rising interest rates and an uneasiness among
consumers are contributing to slumping car and light truck sales,
which fell 14.8 percent in early March compared with the same period
last year, an analyst says.
   The eight U.S.-based vehicle manufacturers reported Tuesday that
vehicles sales averaged 33,838 a day during the March 1-10 period,
compared with a daily rate of 36,330 for the same time last year.
   Car sales took the largest hit, dropping 18.5 percent, while
sales of light trucks fell 8 percent, the companies said.
   ``I look at consumer psychology, and you have to believe that
interest rates are beginning to dampen it,'' said analyst Mary Anne
Sudol of Fitch Investors Service Inc. of New York. ``That has to cut
into the family's disposable income and maybe they're thinking maybe
let the old buggy do longer. I think consumers are very edgy.''
   The prime lending rate _ what banks charge their most
creditworthy customers _ has risen 1 percentage point in the past
month to 11.5 percent.
   Analysts and auto industry insiders expected the early March
sales rate to be below that of last year, when incentives were
drawing consumers to showrooms like magnets. Incentives were offered
during the period this year, but haven't had the draw of last year.
   ``People have become jaded about them,'' Sudol said. ``I hadn't
looked for anything robust.''
   Each of the Big Three automakers showed double-digit declines in
car sales during early March, with Chrysler Corp.'s figures dropping
35.9 percent, Ford Motor Co.'s sales slumping 21.4 percent and
General Motors Corp.'s sales running 13.4 percent behind last year's
pace.
   Automakers will be closely watching the traditionally good early
spring buying, especially during the next two months.
   ``It's the classic warmup for the summer driving season,'' Sudol
said. ``Everybody comes out of hibernation.''
   Traditionally, March and April sales have reduced automakers'
inventories, which are hovering around the 80-day level.
   According to Ward's Automotive Reports, the combined inventory
among the U.S.-based automakers is at its highest level in 19 months.
   Each of the Big Three recently boosted incentive offers in an
effort to stoke the sales fire, and GM temporarily halted production
at two plants to reduce inventory.
   For the year, car and light truck sales by U.S.-based makers were
running 6.9 percent behind last year's pace, falling to a daily rate
of 33,838 vehicles so far this year from a rate of 36,330 last year.
A 9.7 percent decline in car sales was offset by a 1.7 percent drop
in truck sales.
   Chrysler's car sales were down 21.4 percent on a year-to-year
comparison. Chrysler's light trucks sales were 8.5 percent lower for
the early March period and up 3.5 percent for the year.
   For the year, Ford's car sales were 3.3 percent lower than last
year's rate. The nation's No. 2 vehicle maker said its truck sales
were down 20.6 percent in early March compared with the same period
last year, and were off 3.5 percent for the year.
   GM's car sales for the year ran 14.4 percent behind last year's
pace. Light truck sales by GM were up 5.6 percent during the early
part of the month, and for the year, GM's trucks are selling at a
rate 5.8 percent behind last year's.

   Here are sales results for the eight major U.S.
automakers for the first period of March 1989.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals. There
were nine selling days in the period this year and nine selling days
last year, and 58 selling days so far this year, compared with 59
selling days in the corresponding period a year earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic and appear in
this table.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and Chrysler
names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and trucks are
reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Judge Blocks Railroad Sympathy Strikes, Unions Will Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commuters have once again been spared the
nightmare of a railroad workers' walkout as a federal judge decided
to continue his ban against honoring the picket lines of Eastern
Airlines strikers.
   But union leaders said they plan to appeal the court order,
possibly as soon as today.
   ``I have little doubt that it will be appealed,'' said Sheldon
Engelhard, attorney for the Machinists union, which struck Eastern
on March 4.
   U.S. District Judge Robert P. Patterson Jr. said there is ``a
clear risk of immediate and irreparable injury'' to four area
railroads and the riding public if railroad unions are allowed to
strike in sympathy with Eastern workers.
   Patterson's 34-page opinion signed late Monday and released
Tuesday morning will give the railroads the injunction they sought
against sympathy strikes.
   The judge noted that both sides agree all four rail lines _ the
Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Commuter Railroad, New Jersey
Transit Rail Operations and Amtrak _ will have to shut down if their
unionized workers honor Eastern strikers' picket lines.
   In addition to the economic losses such sympathy strikes would
cause the railroads, ``the public, over 400,000 persons, will suffer
immediate and irreparable injury, both in substantial inconvenience
and in loss of pay by those unable to get to work,'' Patterson found.
   He conceded that an injunction would deny the unions an
opportunity to express union solidarity but he said the harm they
would suffer ``is far less'' than that faced by the railroads and
public in the event of a walkout.
   Patterson said his preliminary injunction, to be issued later
this week, will prevent the rail workers unions from engaging in
``sympathy strikes, slowdowns or other concerted labor activity in
connection with any picketing of plaintiffs by striking Eastern
Machinists.''
   In the meantime, a temporary restraining order against sympathy
strikes remains in place.
   ``Judge Patterson's decision protects hundreds of thousands of
rail commuters from becoming hostages in a labor dispute that is
totally unrelated to the MTA. It would have been absurd for the
customers of Metro-North and the LIRR to pay the price for a strike
at Eastern Airlines,'' said Metropolitan Transportation Authority
Chairman Robert Kiley.
   But William Wintisinger, president of the IAM, said in a
statement issued by the union that Patterson's ruling ``clearly
oversteps his authority.''
   The statement continued: ``When the judge stated that his
decision was based on a `clear risk of immediate irreparable injury
to three area railroads and the public' he made a decision that only
the president of the United States is authorized to make.''
   The statement explained that under the Railway Labor Act, the
president may appoint an emergency board and temporarily end the
dispute for 60 days.
   Patterson issued a temporary restraining order March 5, barring
workers at the LIRR, Metro-North and NJ Transit from honoring
Eastern strikers' picket lines. Amtrak workers were added to the
order a day later.
   Patterson, who has only been on the federal bench for about three
months, conducted two days of hearings at federal court in Manhattan
on the issue.
   The unions claimed that federal labor law barred a federal judge
from intervening in such a dispute.
   Patterson said he would require the rail unions to instruct their
members ``to report for work'' because some unions have always
honored picket lines without specific instructions from their
leaders.
   But James Phelan, general chairman of the United Transportation
Union's Metro-North local, said: ``My union's constitution talks
about picket sites as being dangerous places and the UTU intends to
defend its members' rights to avoid confrontations and other
volatile situations such as picket lines.
   ``We, the UTU, did not encourage or endorse sympathetic action,
so that was not an issue for us,'' Phelan said.
   If the machinists put up a picket line at Metro-North, Phelan
said he would encourage his members ``to run the other way.''

   Stock prices weakened in calm midday trading
Wednesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was down 13.9
points at 2,114.5 around 12:15 p.m local time, although off its
midmorning worst level of 2,109.0.

   Volume totaled 332.2 million shares, compared with 373.9 million

   Shares prices were buoyed Tuesday by Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson's fiscally tight budget. But on Wednesday, a perception
that the budget contained nothing specifically advantageous for the
equity market depressed prices a bit.

   Prices headed higher in the stock market today
after the government reported a slightly smaller-than-expected U.S.
trade deficit for January.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 7.50 to 2,313.75 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 4 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 495 up, 363 down and

   Volume on the Big Board came to 23.23 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
trade deficit narrowed to $9.49 billion in January from a revised
$10.99 billion the month before.
   The data, which were formerly reported in two ways, are now
posted only under a method that excludes costs of freight and
insurance.
   The latest figure came in below most Wall Street economists'
estimates, prompting some buying by traders.
   But enthusiasm was muted by worries that less favorable news

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit shrank to $9.49 billion in
January, with the nation posting a rare trade surplus with Western
Europe and the imbalance with Japan declining to its lowest point in
about four years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department attributed the 13.7 percent improvement
in the overall shortfall _ the best showing since October _ to a 6.9
percent drop in imports that was enough to offset a 4.3 percent
decline in U.S. export sales.
   The monthly improvement was better than many analysts had been
expecting, although they cautioned against reading too much into a
one-month swing in the figures.
   The $9.49 billion January deficit would translate into an annual
imbalance of $114 billion, compared with a deficit for all of 1988
of $119.76 billion.
   Stock and bond prices were slightly higher today after the
report. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 5.54 at
2,311.79 after an hour of trading.
   Separately, the Commerce Department said business inventories
rose 0.7 percent in January while sales advanced at a strong 1
percent pace. The report indicated steady economic growth.
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales
dropped 0.4 percent in February. The decline was sparked by a sharp
drop in sales at car dealerships, which account for almost 25
percent of total retail sales.
   The nation's automakers had more bad news: Sales continued to
drop in the first 10 days of March. Analysts speculated the 14.8
percent drop in car and light truck sales from the same period last
year was due in part to rising interest rates.
   Chrysler Corp. said its sales dropped 35.9 percent in early
March, while Ford Motor Co. reported a 21.4 percent decline and
General Motors Corp. said its sales slipped 13.4 percent.
   Economist John Hagens of the Wefa Group, a Bala Cynwyd, Pa.,
economic forecasting service, said that while the economy entered
1989 with strong momentum, consumers may be cautious in anticipation
of slower economic growth or recession.
   ``A slowing of consumer spending is consistent with the
expectation of a recession,'' Hagens said. ``Consumers are typically
very smart. They know these things, often before economists.''
   However, a drop in consumer spending could by itself cause an
economic slowdown. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the
gross national product.
   The falloff in sales was welcome news to many financial markets,
which have been concerned that the economy is growing too fast to
avoid a flare-up of inflation. The Federal Reserve has been driving
interest rates higher to try to restrain inflation.
   Stock prices rallied in early trading in response to the Commerce
Department report, but ended the day little changed as investors
looked forward to today's release of January trade deficit figures.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day at the same level
where it closed on Monday, 2,306.25.
   On the bond market, the price of the Treasury's closely-watched
30-year issue rose $5 for every $1,000 in face amount as investors'
fears of inflation were calmed by the retail sales report.
   However, the dollar fell in response to the sales report because
of the prospect of lower interest rates. Lower interest rates make
the dollar less attractive to foreign investors.
   While the markets were anticipating the January trade figures,
they got a report on the 1988 deficit on Tuesday. The Commerce
Department said the broadest measure of American trade, the current
account, improved dramatically last year, narrowing to $135.3
billion from a record-high $153.96 billion in 1987.
   A surge in merchandise exports offset a sharp worsening in the
U.S. investment balance sheet, the government said.
   The current account, also known as the balance of payments, is
the most important trade statistic because it measures not only
trade in merchandise but also transactions in investments and other
services.

<TEXT>
   Chile's booming fruit export industry was
paralyzed today as growers and sellers halted all shipments and
began scouring their stocks in response to a worldwide cyanide
contamination scare.
   The military government harshly criticized the U.S. ban on
Chilean fruit imports as ``another roguish act of the United
States'' but promised to check all fruit before it leaves the
country.
   The Independent Democratic Union, a supporter of the military
regime, announced a ``national day of fruit eating'' for Thursday.
Joaquin Lavin, party vice president, said the group is asking
Chileans ``to show the world that our fruits are healthy and of
superior quality.''
   Exporters and growers said Tuesday night they had voluntarily
halted packing and shipping for 72 hours to check inventories.
   Chile's Exporters Association said all fruit should be submitted
to government inspection and none would be exported until it
receives approval from health officials.
   Scores of trucks loaded with fruit were reported idle Tuesday
night in Valparaiso, Chile's principal port city. At many vineyards,
grape pickers were sent back home.
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced that
traces of cyanide had been found in two seedless red grapes from
Chile that were in a batch at the port in Philadelphia.
   The discovery came during spot checks by federal officials after
the U.S. and Japanese embassies in Santiago received anonymous
telephone calls earlier this month saying fruit exports would be
poisoned.
   Health officials in the United States, Canada and Japan warned
consumers not to eat Chilean fruit, and stores began removing from
shelves fruit imported from Chile.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community today said it has
received no reports of contamination of Chilean fruit. A spokesman
for the trade bloc, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the EEC
asked its members if they had any evidence of any such contamination.
   Dansk Supermarked, Denmark's second-largest supermarket chain,
has removed Chilean fruit from its shelves as a precaution.
   President Augusto Pinochet sent his ministers of foreign affairs,
Hernan Errazuriz, and Agriculture, Jaime de la Sotta, to Washington
to discuss the crisis with U.S. officials.
   In Hong Kong, health inspectors on Tuesday seized nearly 6.7 tons
of Chilean seedless red grapes from importers and wholesalers for
testing. The government said health inspectors had contacted local
importers to stop sales of the Chilean grapes.
   Chileans reacted strongly to what they saw as a major blow to
their skyrocketing fruit export industry, which was expected to earn
about $850 million this year, up from $581 million in 1988.
   Nearly 65 percent of Chile's fruit exports _ grapes, melons,
apples and peaches _ go to the United States.
   The fruit industry now employs around 500,000 people, and union
leaders reported scattered layoffs on Tuesday.
   The government said the poisoning of the grapes was the work of
``terrorism backed by the Communist Party.''
   Jose Sanfuentes, a spokesman for the Communists, denied his party
was in any way involved. Speaking at a news conference, he
criticized the government for faulty controls of exported fruits.
   Many Chileans said the U.S. reaction was exaggerated.
   ``I don't think an anonymous phone call and two grapes may be
allowed to endanger the entire world trade. It may even be a testing
error,'' de la Sotta said.
   Chile is at the height of the harvesting season and De la Sotta
said it expected to export about 103 million crates of fruit. He
said about 47 million crates had been shipped and another 17 million
were in warehouses awaiting shipment or en route to various
countries.
   Adm. Jose Merino, navy commander and a member of the ruling
military junta, blamed both the Communists and the United States.
   ``This is yet another roguish act of the United States,'' he told
reporters. ``Americans think we are all banana republics. Chile is
not a banana republic.''
   He said Chile should find alternative markets for its fruit and
forget the United States.

   Quick agreement between congressional and
administration budget negotiators is unlikely and Congress may miss
its April 15 deadline for drafting a spending plan, House Majority
Leader Thomas S. Foley said today.
   ``I do not expect this to move very fast,'' Foley, D-Wash., said
as the closed-door talks resumed on Capitol Hill. ``It has to move
over a period of time. it's a gradual process.''
   Foley said he did not expect agreement by March 23, when the
negotiating group is scheduled to report back to President Bush and
the House and Senate leadership. ``I think the 23rd is very early,''
he said.
   ``What we would like to do is meet the April 15 date for a budget
resolution,'' he said. But ``that often has not been possible'' and
a May 15 completion of a fiscal 1990 budget might be more realistic,
he said.
   Bush and congressional leaders agreed at a White House meeting
Tuesday that the talks would aim to develop a consensus on broad
generalities instead of specific programs in hopes of finding
progress before the end of next week.
   ``I believe it is a historic step,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici,
R-N.M., the senior Republican on the Budget Committee who gave the
most bubbly assessment following the meeting. ``I look forward to
the beginning of earnest negotiations,'' he said.
   The Democratic chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn., was upbeat but less sanguine.
   ``I think we've got at least a 50-50 chance at this juncture of a
successful negotiation,'' said Sasser. ``I don't want to overstate
the chances of success, however.''
   White House aides have been meeting steadily with congressional
budget writers since Bush on Feb. 9 released his $1.16 trillion
spending plan for fiscal 1990. However, the discussions have dwelled
on the scope and format of their mission as neither side has been
willing to propose either new taxes or new spending cuts to reduce
the deficit.
   At Bush's invitation, the budget negotiators, key committee
chairmen and the party leaders of the House and Senate met Tuesday
at the White House to see if the talks could be moved forward.
   They agreed the talks would aim for an overall balance between
entitlements, other domestic programs, military spending and foreign
aid, and the amount of new government revenue that would be raised.
They would produce overall numbers, but not decide on the policies
needed to implement them.
   ``We (budget negotiators) have in thepast devoted way too much
time concerning ourselves with the details of programs,'' said
Domenici. The details were rightly left to the House and Senate
committees with jurisdiction over the specific programs, he said.
   House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., said that
while the product would be only broad numbers, the discussions would
of necessity touch on many specifics and the going could be tough.
``In order to reach these, we have got to have policy discussions
about what's do-able,'' he said.
   Domenici said the talks would also focus first on only fiscal
1990. After that, he said, negotiators might see if there was a
chance for a two-year pact.
   For fiscal 1990, the Gramm-Rudman law calls for reducing the
deficit to $100 billion. Both Democrats and Republicans agree that
goal can be met without a tax increase.
   However, many Democrats contend the fiscal 1991 target of $64
billion can't reached without new taxes, something Bush has
continuously said he would oppose.
   The current talks involve Bush's budget director, Richard Darman,
and the chairman and senior Republicans of the House and Senate
budget committees. The group has said it hopes to reach some
consensus by March 23, when the House begins its Easter reess.
   With the talks moving slowly, the Democratic-controlled Congress
has begun moving ahead with its own budget process.
   The Senate Budget Committee plans to begin public drafting of a
spending plan on Friday, and the House Budget Committee staff is
putting together a package for that panel to consider following the
Easter recess.

   Hospital Corporation of America
shareholders today overwhelmingly approved selling the nation's
largest hospital management company to a management-led group for $5
billion.
   More than 41.7 million shares of common stock were voted in favor
of the debt-financed acquisition. About 5 million shares were voted
against the sale.
   HCA Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. told a standing-room-only group of
shareholders, ``This has been a fantastic 20-plus years.''
   ``It's exceeded many times over the founders' dreams for the
company,'' he said.
   Shareholders voted on the offer of $51-a-share by TF Investments
Inc., the management-led group headed by Frist.
   HCA spokesman Victor L. Campbell said the transaction can be
valued at $6 billion if both debt and equity in the new company is
counted. If the cost of financing isn't counted the pricetag is
about $3.6 billion, he said.
   A $1.3 billion short-term loan must be repaid within two years,
and Campbell said some HCA assets will be sold to meet that
obligation. The loan helped finance the buyout.
   Campbell said a decision still has not been reached on which
assets will be sold.
   HCA is the leading hospital management company in the United
States, with properties that include 79 medical-surgical hospitals
and 48 psychiatric hospitals.
   He said the company's proxy statement to shareholders indicated
subsidiary properties likely will be the first to go.
   ``It would be fair to say the company has no agreement to sell
any of its hospital facilities at this time,'' Campbell said.
   The management group submitted the only buyout proposal by a Nov.
18 deadline set by HCA's board of directors. The board approved the
buyout Nov. 22.
   Co-arrangers for TF Investments' purchase are Morgan Guaranty
Trust Co. of New York and The Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Additional loan commitments were obtained from Continental
Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago, General Electric
Capital Corp., the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., Toronto -Dominion
Bank and Deutsche Bank.
   The group received equity commitments from Frist, HCA management
and Richard Rainwater for $125 million, the HCA stock bonus
retirement plan for $75 million and $100 million from ``affiliates
of certain of the lenders,'' a HCA statement said.
   HCA is the leading hospital management company in the United
States, with properties that include 79 medical-surgical hospitals
and 48 psychiatric hospitals.

<HEAD>Maxwell Says New European Paper Due This Fall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Publisher Robert Maxwell said Wednesday his new
newspaper, The European, originally scheduled to be launched in May
as a daily, will begin publishing this autumn as a weekly.
   Maxwell told the Foreign Press Association that The European
would initially be a weekend paper.
   The owner of Mirror Group Newspapers said research has convinced
him the paper should begin as a weekly ``to establish a base from
which daily publication could begin.''
   Maxwell said differences between the French and British
executives of The European were part of the reason for postponing
its launch.
   ``I could hardly launch a newspaper dedicated to the concept of
European unity with a warring crew,'' he said.
   ``I think I can now see my way toward preserving the peace or, if
not, ensuring that any hostility which remains is constructive,' he
said.
   Maxwell said The European, ``printed mostly in English,'' would
be published on Fridays to create a ``firm footing in a new market
from which we can later begin a daily publication.''
   ``Our purpose is to inform, enlighten, entertain and propagate
the ideals of a Europe united from the Atlantic to the Urals,''
Maxwell said.
   ``The weekly edition will be more able to analyze and report the
issues which affect the daily lives of the people of Europe, as well
as their interests in the arts, sport, fashion and humor, savings,
finance, politics, science, medicine and agriculture.
   ``We will be a good and exciting newspaper and a must for all
those who recognize that Europe is our only true future,'' he said.

<HEAD>NYSE Earnings Fall 69.4 Percent In 1988</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The New York Stock Exchange said Wednesday its
profit fell 69.4 percent last year because of a decline in trading
from the record level of 1987.
   The Big Board said it earned $10.4 million, down from $34.1
million, as revenue from the NYSE and its subsidiaries fell 7.4
percent to $323.5 million from a record $349.4 million in 1987.
   Trading volume of 40.8 billion shares was the second highest ever
but down 14.5 percent from the record of 47.8 billion shares a year
earlier. Trading in 1987 was swollen by the bull market that
prevailed for most of the year and then by the crash that occurred
in October.
   Average daily trading volume fell to 161.5 million shares in 1988
from 188.9 million in 1987, the exchange said.
   The decline in trading was partially offset by increased revenue
from new listings. A record 155 companies joined the NYSE last year,
it said.
   The exchange, a not-for-profit company, gets most of its revenue
from fees charged to companies for being listed on the exchange and
fees on daily trades. It reports its earnings annually.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed to
$9.49 billion in January, as the nation posted a rare trade surplus
with Western Europe and the imbalance with Japan declined to its
lowest point in 2{ years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the sharp 13.7 percent improvement
in the overall trade deficit, the best showing since October,
reflected a 6.9 percent drop in imports that was enough to offset a
4.3 percent decline in U.S. export sales.
   While the trade improvement was hailed by the Bush
administration, many private analysts said the figures did not
change their view that America's trading performance would most
likely weaken in 1989 as the U.S. boom in export sales slows and
America's oil bill increases because of higher world oil prices.
   The $9.49 billion January deficit would translate into an annual
imbalance of $114 billion, compared with a deficit for all of 1988
of $119.76 billion.
   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said he
expected this year's deficit to rise to around $130 billion,
reflecting in large part the fact that world oil prices have not hit
$18 per barrel, up from lows approaching $12 per barrel last year.
   ``That is a huge increase in the price of oil and will likely add
$1 billion to our oil bill each month,'' Evans said. ``When you
combine that with the fact that our export boom has run out of
steam, the January report is going to be the last reduction we get
in our trade deficit for quite some time.''
   But the Bush administration's top trade officials, Commerce
Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills, called the January improvement an encouraging sign that the
deficit is continuing to decline.
   ``The year is starting on a plus note,'' Mosbacher said in his
statement. ``Our aim should be to build on this improvement in the
months ahead, and I will do all in my power to encourage businesses,
large and small, to sell U.S. products abroad.''
   The January deficit reflected a rare surplus of $46.5 million
with Western Europe, the first trade surplus there since September
1983.
   The trade deficit with Japan dropped to $3.5 billion. While this
was, as usual, the highest imbalance the United States had with any
country, it was the lowest deficit with Japan since June 1986, when
it was $3.37 billion. The Commerce Department had originally said
the deficit with Japan was the lowest since February 1985 but after
further checking corrected that statement.
   The $9.49 billion January trade imbalance followed a $10.99
billion deficit in December and was the smallest imbalance since
$8.78 billion in October.
   Starting with the January report, the government is removing the
cost of shipping and insurance from the import totals, a bookkeeping
change that has the effect of lowering each month's trade deficit by
about $1.5 billion. The adjustments were also made to the prior
months' data to conform with the new reporting system.
   With shipping and insurance charges included, the 1988
merchandise trade deficit was $137.3 billion and with those costs
removed the deficit totaled $119.76 billion.
   The January performance reflected a 6.9 percent decline in
imports, which fell to a seasonally adjusted $37.29 billion.
   The smaller import figure reflected declines in sales of foreign
consumer goods, down $1.4 billion, and a drop in sales of foreign
cars, down $700 million.
   U.S. imports of oil were up sharply in January, rising 6.1
percent to $3.5 billion, reflecting higher petroleum prices. The
price per barrel jumped to $14.46 from $13.10 in December, while the
number of barrels fell to 7.8 million barrels per day from 8.11
million barrels in December.
   U.S. export sales fell 4.3 percent to $27.8 billion, down from a
record $29.06 billion in December.
   The drop reflected declines in sales of capital goods, down $1.2
billion, and industrial supplies, which fell $600 million.
   The measurement change removing the costs of shipping and
insurance, adopted by Congress at the urging of the Reagan
administration, will return the government to the trade accounting
procedures used before 1979.
   Starting in that year, the government included the costs paid to
foreigners to ship and insure their products as part of the
country's total import bill. Former Sen. Russell Long, D-La.,
sponsored an amendment making the change.
   However, Reagan administration officials argued that the shipping
costs were actually payments for services and should be included in
the services category of the current account trade report, which
breaks U.S. trade down into trade in merchandise and trade in
services.
   The government released data on Tuesday showing that the current
account deficit for 1988 totaled $135.3 billion, a 12.1 percent
improvement from the all-time high of $153.96 billion set in 1987.

   Prices edged higher on Wall Street today after
the government reported a slightly smaller-than-expected U.S. trade
deficit for January.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 5.89 to 2,312.14

   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit

   The data, which were formerly reported in two ways, are now
posted only under a method that excludes costs of freight and
insurance.
   The latest figure came in below most Wall Street economists'
estimates, prompting some buying by traders.
   Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
traders were pleased by declines in U.S. imports and exports, which
investors interpreted as indicating a possible cooling off in the
economy.
   But the market gave up ground as traders worried that less
favorable news might be looming when the monthly figures on the

   The U.S. merchandise trade deficit narrowed
sharply in January to $9.49 billion, the lowest imbalance in three
months, as a big decline in consumer imports offset a higher oil
bill, the government reported Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department said that the imbalance between imports
and exports fell by 13.7 percent from a revised December deficit of
$10.99 billion as the United States posted a rare trade surplus with
Europe and the deficit with Japan fell to its lowest point in 2{
years.
   The Bush administration hailed the development as an encouraging
sign of progress in whittling down the country's huge trade deficit,
but many private economists were far less encouraged.
   Some analysts called the January figure a one-month fluke in what
they believe will be an otherwise dreary outlook for U.S. trade
prospects this year.
   In 1988, the U.S. trade deficit declined by 21 percent to $119.76
billion as a boom in export sales helped provide two-fifths of the
year's total economic growth.
   But analysts are forecasting that export sales, despite
aggressive market-opening efforts on the part of the administration,
will slow significantly in 1989 while America's foreign oil bill
increases, reflecting rising world oil prices.
   ``The January report is going to be the last reduction we get in
our trade deficit for quite some time,'' said Michael Evans, head of
a Washington forecating firm. ``Our export boom ran out of steam
some time ago and now we are seeing the effect of higher oil
prices.''
   Evans predicted that the U.S. trade deficit would actually
increase to $130 billion this year, based on the adverse trends.
That would be a blow to the administration, which is counting on
export-led growth to help keep the U.S. economy moving forward at a
rapid clip, bringing in the government revenues needed to lower the
federal budget deficit.
   Both Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, the administration's top trade
officials, issued statements hailing the January decline as an
encouraging development.
   ``The year is starting on a plus note,'' Mosbacher said. ``Our
aim should be to build on this improvement in the months ahead.''
   The administration has adopted a tough trade stance, pledging to
work aggressively to open foreign markets to more U.S. products. But
many private economists expressed doubt that there is much room left
for American exports to grow, given the 27 percent jump in export
sales which occurred last year.
   ``We have to get a decline in imports for us to mount another
significant improvement in our trade deficit,'' said Allen Sinai,
chief economist of the Boston Co. Sinai said any lasting drop in
imports was unlikely until there is a significant slowdown in the
U.S. economy.
   The January deficit reflected a surplus of $46.5 million with
Western Europe, the first trade surplus there since September 1983,
primarily reflecting higher U.S. sales in Britain and France.
   The trade deficit with Japan dropped to $3.5 billion with
two-fifths of that decline reflecting a drop in Japanese car
imports. The Japanese deficit, as usual the largest of any country,
fell to its lowest point since a $3.37 billion imbalance in June
1986.
   William T. Archey, the top trade expert with the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, said it remained to be seen whether this decline was just
a blip in the monthly statistics or reflected the fact that more
Japanese cars are being manufactured at plants in the United States.
   Starting with the January report, the government is removing the
cost of shipping and insurance from the import totals, a bookkeeping
change that has the effect of lowering each month's trade deficit by
about $1.5 billion. The adjustments were also made to the prior
months' data to conform with the new reporting system.
   With shipping and insurance charges included, the 1988
merchandise trade deficit was $137.3 billion. The measurement change
removing the costs of shipping and insurance, adopted by Congress at
the urging of the Reagan administration, will return the government
to the trade accounting procedures used before 1979.
   The January deficit of $9.49 billion reflected declines in both
imports and exports, which had hit all-time record levels in
December.
   U.S. imports fell by 6.9 percent to $37.29 billion as sales of
foreign consumer goods declined by $1.4 billion and foreign car
shipments declined by $700 million.
   U.S. imports of oil, however, were up sharply in January, rising
6.1 percent to $3.5 billion, reflecting rising prices. The price per
barrel jumped to $14.46 from $13.10 in December, while the number of
barrels fell to 7.8 million barrels per day from 8.11 million
barrels in December.
   Analysts said with world oil prices already at $18 per barrel,
America's oil bill would be rising even higher in the future.
   U.S. export sales fell 4.3 percent to $27.8 billion, down from a
record $29.06 billion in December. The drop reflected declines in
sales of capital goods, down $1.2 billion, and industrial supplies,
which fell $600 million.

from a revised deficit of $10.99 billion in December.
   ``Overall, the trade figures were non-controversial,'' said the
chief dealer at a U.S. bank in London. ``They were neither good nor
bad, and they opened the way for the market to do what it wanted to
do naturally _ buy dollars.''
   Another dealer agreed: ``The dollar is being boosted by natural
business.''
   The U.S. Federal Reserve reportedly intervened when most trading
in London had ended for the day.
   The British pound continued to benefit from Tuesday's national
budget presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, who
indicated interest rates would remain high to combat inflat.
   Dealers predicted the pound will continue upward.
   Late Wednesday, one British pound closed at $1.7235, more
expensive for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7170.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Tuesday's
late rates: 1.8670 West German marks, up from 1.8630; 1.6038 Swiss
francs, up from 1.5935; 6.3200 French francs, up from, 6.3125;
2.1065 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1010; 1,369.37 Italian lire, up
from 1,366.12; and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1970.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 129.88 Japanese yen, down
from 129.92. In London the dollar traded higher at 130.27 yen.
   Gold bullion prices declined on profit-taking in light trading.
   The late bid price for gold in London was $392.25 a troy ounce,
down from $395.75. The late Zurich bid price was $393.25 an ounce,
down from 395.25.
   Earlie,r in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.91 an ounce, up from
$395.37.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $6.12 a troy ounce, down
from $6.17.

   Living on welfare while dying of AIDS, Ron found grim
satisfaction that his death would enrich the beneficiary of his
$35,000 life insurance policy.
   Now, under an experiment by the Canadian subsidiary of Prudential
Insurance Co., the 44-year-old Ontario man has received $25,000 of
his own death benefits to make his last days more livable.
   ``Having the money, being able to pay my share of expenses,
really helped bring back part of my self-esteem,'' said ``Ron,'' who
spoke on condition that his real name not be used.
   He is one of only five people to receive ``living benefits,''
under a program that has paid out less than $100,000. Prudential
officials and insurance industry experts believe it could be the
precursor to a future where the terminally ill can tap into life
insurance benefits to help with medical and living costs.
   ``We are working here in the United States on the possibility of
offering living benefits for hospice and nursing home care and organ
transplants,'' said Joseph Vecchione, Prudential's vice president
for public relations. ``We realize that such efforts could serve
important social purposes.''
   The Canadian experiment was the creation of Ron Barbaro,
president for Prudential's Canadian operations. Barbaro, a
fund-raiser for a Toronto AIDS hospice, learned that AIDS victims
are often thrown into poverty, left with few resources and little
dignity.
   ``I asked why we couldn't forget the rule that you needed a death
certificate in order to pay benefits,'' he said. ``I thought we
should look to the other side of the ledger and do something for
customers who are suffering terrible indignities.''
   Encouraged by his parent company, Barbaro sought out terminally
ill policy holders. Prudential medical officials contacted the
policy holders' doctors beginning last summer and negotiations were
begun.
   ``The beneficiaries have been more than cooperative,'' said Glenn
Daniels, assistant general counsel for Prudential's Canadian branch.
   Under the agreements, money is given to the policy holder as a
loan against the balance of the death benefits. In Ron's case, he
received $25,000 of the $35,000 policy. His beneficiary, a friend,
readily agreed.
   When the policy holder dies, Prudential figures the amount of
interest it would have earned on the money already paid out and
deducts that sum from the remainder of the death benefits.
   Daniels said that allows the policy holder to get the money early
without costing the insurance company lost interest on the sum.
   ``Nobody loses,'' he said.
   For Ron, who lost his $56,000-a-year job because of his illness,
the money eased the stress of filing for bankruptcy and living on
welfare for most of the six years he's been diagnosed with AIDS.
   ``The first thing I did with the money was to go out and have a
very good meal,'' he said.
   He moved to a larger apartment, bought new clothes, a stereo and
a washer and dryer, which allowed him to do his own laundry for the
first time in months. His illness had left him too weak to carry his
clothes to the laundromat.
   ``It gave me back a sense of independence and self-esteem,'' he
said.
   Ron also used part of the money to travel 1,200 miles for a
reunion and reconciliation with his family.
   ``It all meant a great deal to me,'' he said. ``I think it's the
most compassionate innovative piece of management I've come across
in years.''
   While the pilot program isn't solely for AIDS patients _
Barbaro's unit is now helping a policy holder with an inoperable
brain tumor _ AIDS advocates hail the Prudential program as an
important step.
   ``The insurance industry as a whole has had a business-as-usual
approach to AIDs and has done very little to come up with new
approaches,'' said Ben Schatz, director of the National Gay Rights
Advocates' AIDS Civil Rights Project and a member of the AIDS
advisory committee of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners.
   Still, it may be a long time before U.S. insurers adopt similar
plans.
   ``We are serious about the program, but we don't know what we'll
encounter when we get to the regulatory route,'' Prudential's
Vecchione said, noting that every state has its own insurance
industry regulations.
   He pointed to another potential problem: ``The proceeds of a life
insurance policy to a beneficiary are tax free. We don't know
whether that would apply in this case.''
   Although a handful of U.S. insurance companies offer special
policies that provide payment before death, John Booth, vice
president and chief actuary of the American Council of Life
Insurance, said insurance companies may be leery of adapting such a
program on a large scale.
   One reason is the cost of negotiating each claim could become
astronomical if it became available to the hundreds of thousands of
people diagnosed each year with a terminal disease. In 1987 the U.S.
insurance industry paid $20 billion in death benefits.
   Booth also said there are fears that such a program would
encourage those with terminal illnesses to try to buy life insurance.
   Despite the problems, Barbaro believes his program will
eventually be adopted by U.S. insurers. ``I think it's inevitable
based on the simplicity of the idea.''

   Prices moved modestly higher on Wall Street today
after the government's report of a slightly smaller-than-expected
U.S. trade deficit for January.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.64 to 2,315.89
as of 3 p.m. EST.
   Advancers ran slightly ahead of losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 702 up, 650 down and 553
unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 140.46 million shares with an
hour of trading left.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $9.49 billion in January from a revised $10.99 billion
the month before.
   The data, which were formerly reported in two ways, are now
posted only under a method that excludes costs of freight and
insurance.
   The latest figure came in below most Wall Street economists'
estimates, prompting some buying by traders.
   Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
traders were pleased by declines in U.S. imports and exports, which
investors interpreted as indicating a possible cooling-off of the
economy.
   But the market's response was colored by worries that less
favorable news might be looming when the government issues its
wholesale price report for February on Friday.
   The most actively traded issue on the NYSE was Hospital Corp. of
America, which rose [ to 49\ after the company's shareholders
approved a buyout by a management group.
   Sea Containers Ltd. gained 1] to 45~ on top of an 8{-point jump

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mixed to
mostly lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat was hampered by profit-taking early, and stayed under
pressure most of the day because of selling by a large commission
house and traders' indifference to some forecasts for less rain this
weekend for the winter wheat growing regions of the Plains.
   With little news on either side, beans and corn held to narrow
ranges throughout the day.
   ``We just marked time all day,'' said Vic Lespinasse, a floor
trader for Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago. ``There was no real
definition in any of the markets.''
   On the close, wheat was 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher, with the

<HEAD>Shamrock Claims Polaroid's Self-Tender Offer Is Misleading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shamrock Holdings Inc. claimed Wednesday that
Polaroid Inc.'s tender offer for 16 million of its shares is
misleading under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, but
Polaroid called the complaint a delay tactic.
   In U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., Judge Caleb Wright
heard arguments from lawyers representing the two companies, which
have been embroiled in a hostile takeover battle for months. Wright
reserved judgment on the matter until later this week.
   Shamrock representatives said the self-tender offer, at $50 a
share and expiring March 20, is misleading because Polaroid hasn't
released a full and fair disclosure of its pertinent information,
such as records of the company's settlement with Kodak over instant
photography technology. But Polaroid said Shamrock wants to delay
the closing and gain a tactical advantage by buying all the
available shares for $45 each.
   ``What Shamrock wants desperately here is delay,'' said Polaroid
attorney Robert S. Rifkind.
   Polaroid's stock repurchase offer is subject to various
conditions, including definitive financing, an absence of adverse
decisions in lawsuits with Shamrock, and changes in Shamrock's
hostile bid.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock's hostile takeover bid since
July, when the Burbank, Calif., company made a friendly but
unsolicited offer of $40 a share. In January, it upped the bid to
$45.
   Polaroid last July put 9.7 million shares into an employee stock
ownership plan. In January, the company announced a recapitalization
plan that included selling $300 million of stock to Corporate
Partners L.P., a private investment group.
   Shamrock, a television and radio concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid and is
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the
May 9 annual meeting, in addition to its hostile tender offer.
   The companies are also expecting a decision this week from a
lower Delaware court on whether a judge will combine her decision on
Polaroid's employee stock ownership plan with a new request for a
preliminary injunction by Shamrock against Polaroid's agreement with
Corporate Partners.

<HEAD>Time, Warner Executives To Be Well Paid in Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The proposed $18 billion merger between Time Inc.
and Warner Communications Inc. could be a highly lucrative
transaction for top executives of the two media firms, the companies
said.
   Warner Chairman Steven Ross is expected to get nearly $50 million
by exercising stock rights under his employment contract when the
merger takes place, the company said in a filing Tuesday with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
   Ross will receive a salary of $800,000 a year and a share of the
profits in the merged company, Time Warner Inc. The arrangement is
roughly equivalent to compensation Ross receives at Warner, the
company said.
   Other top Warner executives could receive as much as $15 million
each by exercising their rights under Warner stock's option plan,
Warner said. The plan allows the executives to cash in their
holdings in the event of a merger.
   At Time, Chairman J. Richard Munro and President N.J. Nicholas
Jr. will not receive large cash payouts as a result of the merger
that will create the world's largest media concern. However, they
stand to draw large salaries under their compensation agreements
with the new company.
   Munro, who will serve as co-chairman of Warner with Ross for the
next two years, will receive at least $1.46 million in annual salary
and bonuses, Time spokesman Louis Slovinsky said.
   If Munro retires before May 1990 he will receive nearly $4.28
million in deferred compensation and still be paid $750,000 a year
as chairman of the executive committee, Slovinsky said.
   The terms are similar to those Munro would have at Time without a
merger, but provide for increases depending on how well Time Warner
performs.
   Nicholas, who will succeed Munro and is expected to become Time
Warner's sole chief executive after five years, will be paid at
least $1.3 million annually. However, the company said stock options
expected to be granted to Nicholas and other Time executives could
sharply increase his compensation.
   Warner Communications has a larger compensation structure than
Time does. The Wall Street Journal quoted sources as saying Time
Warner likely will bring Time managers in line with their Warner
counterparts after the merger is completed.
   The merger, which will be accomplished through a stock swap, will
create a company with projected annual revenue of $10 billion.

   Futures industry leaders gathered
Wednesday for their annual four-day meeting amid speculation that
federal authorities in Chicago were preparing to charge six people
in connection with an investigation of trading fraud in the
commodities pits.
   Anton Valukas, the U.S. attorney in Chicago, would not comment on
the rumors, which have been spreading among defense attorneys.
   Meanwhile, some congressmen who usually attend the Futures
Industry Association's annual meeting at the industry's expense
reportedly have made other plans this year, apparently wanting to
avoid appearing to be too close to the industry.
   The government's wide-ranging undercover investigation of
commodity futures trading at the Chicago Board of Trade and the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange has yielded no charges since it was
disclosed on Jan. 19.
   The probe is believed to focus on as many as 100 traders and on
allegations that they systematically cheated customers out of
millions of dollars while executing their orders on the trading
floors of the world's two largest futures exchanges.
   Futures are contracts to buy and sell commodities and financial
instruments at a specified price on a future date.
   Some lawyers representing traders and firms targeted by the
investigation said they believed Valukas was preparing to charge
about half a dozen people in the near future.
   They did not dismiss the possibility that charges may be
announced in Chicago while many futures-industry leaders _ exchange
officials, brokerage executives and commodities lawyers _ are
gathered in Boca Raton.
   ``It would be kind of true to form,'' said Chicago attorney
Gerald Fishman, who recalled that the Chicago Tribune broke the
first story of the investigation while many of the top commodities
lawyers were at an American Bar Association meeting at a Caribbean
resort.
   ``It might have some timely impact to do it while everyone's
gathered together,'' said Jeffrey Cole, another Chicago-based
commodities lawyer.
   About 1,100 people are attending the Futures Industry Association
meeting at the posh Boca Raton Resort and Club, where panel
discussions were scheduled on such topics as regulation, customer
protection and congressional reauthorization of the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that oversees futures
trading.
   Reauthorization of the CFTC, which begins with the House and
Senate Agriculture committees, has been delayed by concerns raised
by the Chicago investigation
   About 20 members of Congress are expected to attend the meeting.
The Chicago Tribune reported on Wednesday that some have will not
have their expenses paid by the trade group or by futures exchanges
and will not accept speaking fees.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman E. ``Kika'' de la Garza,
D-Texas, who usually attends the meeting, decided not to go after
reports of the investigation surfaced, the Tribune reported, citing
an unnamed source it said was close to the committee.
   Rep. Glenn English, D-Okla., who is heading the House panel's
investigation into alleged trading abuses, will travel to Florida at
the committee's expense and won't accept a speaking fee for his
appearance at a luncheon Thursday, the Tribune reported, quoting an
unidentified aide.
   Futures Industry Association President John Damgard said some
congressmen ``may want to avoid any semblance of being too close to
the industry'' in light of the federal probe and the CFTC hearings.

   Hospital Corp. of America shareholders
approved on Wednesday a $5 billion buyout of the nation's largest
hospital management company by an investor group led by the firm's
top executives.
   Chairman Thomas Frist Jr. said after the vote that the company
would keep most of its hospitals but sell subsidiary properties to
help finance the deal.
   The investor group, TF Investments Inc., will put HCA's
psychiatric hospitals, management company and international division
up for sale, Frist said, but ``We are not soliciting or accepting
offers'' to sell HCA medical-surgical hospitals.
   TF Investments, which changed its name to HCA-Hospital Corp. of
America Wednesday, is paying $51 a share for more than 71 million
outstanding shares of HCA stock for a $3.6 billion purchase price.
The transaction also includes the assumption of HCA debt, and totals
more than $5 billion, HCA spokesman Victor Campbell said.
   The new HCA will concentrate on operating its 79 hospitals and
plans no layoffs, Frist said.
   ``If you'd ask me what it'd look like one year from today ... we
have approximately 80 today. I'd be quite surprised if we didn't
have 80 then. Maybe add one and sell one,'' he said.
   HCA already has an agreement to sell Allied Clinical
Laboratories, its clinical reference library subsidiary, for $45
million in cash plus the assumption of certain liabilities,
according to HCA's annual report to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   A standing-room-only gathering of about 400 shareholders crowded
a company auditorium for the brief meeting. More than 41.6 million
shares were voted for the buyout, and nearly 5 million share votes
were cast against the transaction.
   ``This has been a fantastic 20-plus years,'' Frist, the son of
one of the company's founders, told shareholders.
   ``It's exceeded many times over the founders' dreams for the
company,'' he said.
   Besides the 79 medical-surgical hospitals, HCA's U.S. holdings
include 48 psychiatric hospitals and four residential treatment
centers. More than 70 percent of the company's hospitals are in
Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia.
   At the end of 1988, HCA owned 25 other hospitals around the
world, mainly in Australia, Brazil and the United Kingdom.

   The dollar headed sharply higher Wednesday
against major foreign currencies in active trading after the
government reported that the January trade deficit shrank to its
lowest level in three months.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a
bid of $391.10 a troy ounce of gold as of 4 p.m. EST, down $4.40
from Tuesday's late bid.
   Currency dealers said the trade report, while in line with
general market expectations, helped revive interest in the dollar
here and abroad.
   ``They (the trade figures) were neither good nor bad, and they
opened the way for the market to do what it wanted to do naturally _
buy dollars,'' explained the chief dealer at a U.S. bank in London.
   The report issued by the Commerce Department showed the trade gap
shrank to $9.49 billion in January from a revised December shortfall
of $10.99 billion, due to a rare surplus with Europe and a decline
in the deficit with Japan. That was the smallest overall imbalance
since $8.78 billion in October.
   Dealers reported that the Federal Reserve sold dollars on at
least three occasions Wednesday, but that such intervention had
little affect on the dollar.
   ``They just wanted to make their presence known,'' said Robert
Ryan, senior trader Irving Trust Co.
   Also helping the dollar Wednesday was the yen's weakness, dealers
said.
   In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar closed at
129.88 Japanese yen, down from 129.92 yen. The dollar traded at
130.27 yen in London, and at 130.60 yen in New York, up from 129.79
yen late Tuesday.
   The British pound rose to $1.7235 in London from Tuesday's late
$1.7170. Sterling fetched $1.7200 in New York, down from $1.7280.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's late
rates, included: 1.87225 West German marks, up from 1.86075; 1.6080
Swiss francs, up from 1.5930; 1.19635 Canadian dollars, up from
1.19385; 6.3355 French francs, up from 6.3065; and 1,373.50 Italian
lire, up from 1,365.75.
   Late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with Tuesday: 1.8670
West German marks, up from 1.8630; 1.6038 Swiss francs, up from
1.5935; 6.3200 French francs, up from, 6.3125; 2.1065 Dutch
guilders, up from 2.1010; 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1970;
and 1,369.37 Italian lire, up from 1,366.12.
   Gold prices declined largely on profit-taking, dealers said.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $392.10 a troy ounce, down from $396.20 Tuesday.
   Gold settled at $392.25 an ounce in London, down from $395.75.
The late Zurich bid was $393.25 an ounce, down from 395.25.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $395.91 an ounce, up from
$395.37.
   Silver prices also weakened. On New York's Comex, silver bullion
for current delivery settled at $6.091 a troy ounce, down from
$6.176 Tuesday. Silver fell in London to $6.12 an ounce from $6.17.

   Included in the latest quarter was a pre-tax charge of $35
million, the company said.
   For the fiscal year, May earned $503 million, or $3.42 per share,
14 percent higher than the previous year's net income of $440
million, or $2.88 a share. Sales rose to $11.5 billion from 9.7
billion.
   ``The year was an excellent one for May,'' said Chairman David C.
Farrell. ``Each of our retail segments contributed to these record
results, making this our 14th consecutive year of both record
earnings and sales and enabling the company to surpass the $500
million milestone in net earnings.''
   Farrell said May was ``well positioned for 1989 and beyond,
including a very aggressive expansion program.''
   He said the company will add 11 new department stores, four
discount stores and 140 Payless ShoeSource stores this year. He said
May would also remodel 25 department stores, expanding 11 of them.
   May is one of the largest retailers in the nation, operating
3,091 stores.

<HEAD>Central Gulf Leasae Sale Attracts High Bids of $397.5 Million</HEAD>

   Two companies who offered more than $18
million were the highest bidders for federal oil and gas leases sold
Wednesday in the central Gulf of Mexico.
   FMP Operating Co. and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co.
entered the joint bid on a 5,000-acre block in the heavily explored
West Delta region south of Plaquemines Parish, La.
   Bids were received on 2.9 million acres of the 32.1 million acres
offered for lease by the Interior Department. High bids totaled
$397.5 million, according to J. Rogers Pearcy, regional director of
Interior's Mineral Management Service.
   ``It was comparable to last year's sale. We didn't have quite as
much deep-water bidding this time,'' said Pearcy.
   In a 1983 lease sale, Pearcy said the government leased $1.4
billion worth of deep-water tracts for a five-year term.
Lease-holders relinquished or let expire 303 of those leases, but
127 of them were resold Wednesday, Pearcy said.
   ``The interest in these previously leased tracts indicates that
the Central Gulf continues to capture the attention of the oil and
gas industry as a promising province,'' said Robert Kallman,
director of MMS.
   ``Throughout the history of oil and gas exploration in the Gulf,
many of the larger discoveries have come from tracts which had been
previously leased,'' said Kallman.
   Last year, 931 bids were received on 684 tracts. This year, 821
bids were received on 591 tracts. One tract got seven bids, but many
attracted only one bidder.
   More small companies participated this year in the annual lease
sale, said an MMS spokeswoman.
   ``We're seeing a number of small and new companies that have not
participated before,'' said Eileen Angelico.
   Angelico said 117 companies qualified to bid this year compared
to 112 last year; 81 actually bid, compared to 84 in 1987, she said.

   The government's report of a slightly
smaller-than-expected U.S. trade deficit for January provided the
impetus for a moderate advance in the stock market Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials gained 14.29 to 2,320.54.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
798 up, 615 down and 534 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 167.07 million
shares, up from 139.97 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those
stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market,
totaled 199.93 million shares.
   The Commerce Department reported that the nation's trade deficit
narrowed to $9.49 billion in January from a revised $10.99 billion
the month before.
   The data, which were formerly reported in two ways, are now
posted only under a method that excludes costs of freight and
insurance.
   The latest figure came in below most Wall Street economists'
estimates, prompting some buying by traders.
   Michael Metz, a market analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said
traders were pleased by declines in U.S. imports and exports, which
investors interpreted as indicating a possible cooling-off of the
economy.
   But the market's response was muted by worries that less
favorable news might be looming when the government issues its
report Friday on the produce price index of finished goods for
February.
   Gainers among the blue chips included American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up ~ at 32|; General Electric, up [ at 45~; Philip
Morris, up ] at 118|, and Coca-Cola, up 1\ at 51{.
   SSMC, which received a modified takeover bid from a group led by
Vincent Tan, a Malaysian investor, picked up 1[ to 35\.
   Hospital Corp. of America rose [ to 49\ in active trading after
the company's shareholders approved a buyout by a management group.
   Sea Containers Ltd. gained 1] to 45~ on top of an 8{-point jump
Tuesday, when investors learned that Stena AB of Sweden has acquired
an 8.17 percent interest in the company and may seek to gain control
of it.
   Mesa Limited Partnership dropped ~ to 11}. The partnership
disclosed plans to reduce its quarterly payout later this year
because of weak natural-gas prices.
   Smithkline Beckman rose 1\ to 54 after signing an agreement with
a British firm for the development and marketing of a new treatment
for arthritis.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $12.37 billion, or 0.42
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks gained
.74 to 166.67.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.02 to 342.97, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was up 1.53 at 296.67.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
advanced .97 to 406.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 331.79, up 1.26.

   The Copyright Office on Wednesday urged
Congress to consider protecting future films from colorization, but
said it would probably be unconstitutional to extend such protection
to existing movies.
   The office said it would prefer legislation that would also
protect visual artists, such as sculptors and painters, by giving
them ``moral rights'' to bar unauthorized alteration of their works.
   But it said it could support legislation applying to film makers
alone. In addition to protecting against colorization, the office
also recommended protecting film makers from technical processes
that speed up or slow down movies to fit the time frames of
television or which alter the shape of the image to fit the
television screen.
   Since most movies are now made in color, the furor about
colorization has been largely over application of the process to
films, including some Hollywood classics, made in the heyday of
black-and-white production in the 1930s through the 1950s.
   The Copyright Office, which is an arm of the Library of Congress,
recommended in its report that an industry-wide committee be formed
to draft guidelines governing colorization of such works.
   The Patent and Trademark Office, in a report released at the same
time, recommended that no changes in the trademark law should be
made but left the door open to changes in copyright law.
   Both reports were requested by the House Judiciary Committee's
subcommittee on copyright, which held hearings on the issue last
year and concluded that no legislation was needed.
   The Copyright Office's report drew lukewarm reaction from the
subcommittee chairman, and a reproof from the industry for getting
involved in the dispute.
   Rep. Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis., subcommittee chairman, promised
to review both reports carefully but added, ``We must ask the
proponents of change to bear the burden of proving that the change
is necessary, fair and practical. Second, we must always recognize,
and balance, the rights of creators, producers or copyright holders,
and the public interest. Third, a private solution negotiated by
interested parties is always preferable to congressional
intervention.''
   The Committee for America's Copyright Community, representing the
publishing, broadcasting, recording and movie industries, said, ``We
are disappointed by the overall tone of the summary.''
   ``We are deeply troubled by an agency of the government making
aesthetic judgments about the quality of creative works,'' the
committee said. ``These decisions belong to the public.''
   Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting System, which has bought MGM and
colorized such old movies as ``Casablanca'' and ``The Maltese
Falcon,'' issued a statement in support of the Copyright Office's
recommendation against applying colorization restrictions to
existing movies.
   But Bert Carp, a TBS spokesman, said the company disagrees with
the recommendation that Congress consider a system of ``moral
rights'' which would ``confer new statutory rights'' on artists.
   ``In our view Congress should not redefine the legal
relationships among the members of our motion picture community to
mimic those of countries which have had much less success,'' Carp
said.
   Ralph Oman, the register of copyrights, urged the subcommittee to
consider, before anything else, a unified package of legislation
covering not only film makers, but also other visual artists, giving
them ``moral rights'' to bar alteration of their work.
   But Oman said the Copyright Office could support a decision to
enact artists' rights legislation to film makers alone. If the
subcommittee chooses this approach, the office said, it should
``carefully consider whether the existing web of collective and
individual bargaining is adequate to protect directors' legitimate
interests.''
   ``The office assumes that any additional moral rights granted
would be prospective only and would not affect existing works,''
Oman said. ``We have concluded that even if Congress wanted to stop
the colorization of existing black-and-white pictures with new moral
rights legislation, the Fifth Amendment would probably stand in the
way. The court would probably see it as a taking without due process
of law.''
   The Fifth Amendment prevents the taking of private property
without due process _ formal legal action without adequate
compensation.
   Oman urged Congress to ``encourage the parties to establish a
voluntary industry-wide steering committee, outside of the
collective bargaining area, to pinpoint those alterations that give
some people heartburn and try to reach industry-wide voluntary
guidelines for existing works.''
   Kastenmaier said his subcommittee had decided no legislation was
needed because existing law was sufficient for the United States to
join the Berne Convention on Copyright, which provides for ``moral
rights'' protection.
   However, Rep. Bob Mrazek, D-N.Y., said the Copyright Office
report ``makes it clear that current U.S. law doesn't meet the
standards of the convention's moral-rights provision.''
   In a companion report requested by the subcommittee, Donald J.
Quigg, commissioner of patents and trademarks, said no change should
be made in the trademark law because of the colorization issue.
   ``We take no position at this time on the desirability of more
extensive moral rights protection for American creative artists''
under the copyright law, Quigg said.

<HEAD>Mosbacher Says Japan Must Do More to Open Markets to U.S. Computer
Items</HEAD>

   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher on
Wednesday said Japan must do more to open its markets to U.S.
high-technology computer products, contending that it has failed to
live up to a 1986 commitment involving semiconductor sales.
   In a speech to a U.S. electronic industries trade association,
Mosbacher sounded a tough line with Japan, the country running the
largest trade surplus with the United States.
   He said American manufacturers of semiconductors and
supercomputers were selling products that were second to none in the
world.
   ``But despite this strength, these sectors have been unable to
capture their fair share of world markets,'' Mosbacher told the
Electronic Industries Association. ``Our semiconductor industry,
especially, has been hurt by unfair pricing practices around the
world and lack of access to Japan's market _ the world's largest
market.''
   Mosbacher said he realized that there were ``many cultural
reasons behind Japan's desire to keep its markets closed. But
changes must come. As painful as it might prove, Japan must open its
semiconductor market to foreign producers.''
   Mosbacher said the Japanese were failing to live up to the spirit
of a pledge they made in September 1986 to raise the foreign,
largely U.S. share, of their nation's semiconductor market to
``slightly above 20 percent'' in five years.
   At the time, the U.S. share of the Japanese semiconductor market
was around 8 percent. It is now around 11 percent. Semiconductors
are the thin wafers at the heart of computers and other electronic
devices.
   Mosbacher has said in the past that Japan will be unable to meet
the 20 percent goal by 1991 unless it dramatically accelerates its
market-opening efforts. He has suggested that a more appropriate
level of U.S. semiconductor sales would be between 15 percent and 20
percent by the end of this year.
   Mosbacher said American producers of supercomputers had only been
able to capture 6 percent of the university and government market in
Japan, in part because of the Japanese practice of issuing technical
specifications which favored Japanese suppliers.
   The Reagan administration imposed higher tariffs on certain
Japanese electronic goods in 1987 because of the semiconductor
dispute. Mosbacher said in Wednesday's speech that President Bush
would lift those sanctions if Japan demonstrated a greater
commitment to opening the door to U.S. products.
   ``I know that President Bush is quite willing to lift the
sanctions that President Reagan imposed,'' Mosbacher said. ``But
Japan must give him a reason for doing so. He must have continuing
evidence of a more open market to act.''

<HEAD>Energy Futures Roll to Gains for Third Straight Session</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy futures prices rolled up impressive gains for a third
straight session Wednesday after a report showed a
larger-than-expected drawdown in U.S. gas stocks last week and Saudi
Arabia's announcement that it would cut allocations to U.S. and
European customers by as much as 30 percent.
   On other markets, precious metals plummeted despite some signs
inflation was heating up and livestock futures were higher and pork
futures mostly higher as traders awaited a key government report and
tried to estimate demand in coming weeks.
   Energy futures took off from the opening bell, stoked by an
American Petroleum Institute (API) report released after the close
of the markets Tuesday that showed gasoline stocks down by 4.7
million barrels and distillate stocks down by 5.9 million over the
previous week.
   The range of estimates preceding the API report ranged from no
change to a drawdown of about 2 million barrels in gasoline stocks.
   The larger-than-expected declines sent prices zooming. Gasoline
took over leadership of the complex from crude oil and the April
contract broke important resistance at 54.50 cents _ a price level
it had scaled three times since last spring but failed to surmount.
   Alos helping prices was a report that Saudi Arabia told the
Aramco Partners, which include most of the largest U.S. and Western
European oil suppliers, that their daily allotment of 1.3 million
barrels would be cut between 20 and 30 percent for April.
   The Saudis, apparently seeking to toe the OPEC line and keep
within production quotas, similarly cut Japanese allotments a day
earlier.
   ``After today, you're looking at the highest energy prices since
the summer of 1987. But it's hard to delineate what propelled the
market,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, vice president of trading and
research for Carson Petroleum.
   ``The API report was a definite spark ... so was the Saudis
cutting back. But once the shelf came out at 54.50, there was a lot
of panic.''
   Crude oil settled 11 cents to 48 cents higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, with the contract for delivery in April at
$19.77 a barrel. Heating oil was .38 cent to 1.79 cents higher, with
April at 54.19 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline soared 1.45
cents to 2.30 cents higher, with April at 55.80 cents a gallon.
   Several analysts said the inflationary implications of higher
energy prices may have been the major reason that the precious
metals, slumping in recent months, didn't fall further Wednesday.
   Precious metals, viewed by investors as a hedge against
inflation, came under pressure at the start of the day after release
of a better-than-expected figure on the U.S. trade deficit.
   Platinum slipped $11 to $11.20 lower on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, with April at $538.30 a troy ounce. Gold settled $4.10 to
$4.80 lower at the Comex, with March at $392.10 a troy ounce; and
silver was 2 cents to 3.1 cents lower, with March at $6.091 a troy
ounce.
   ``It could have been worse if the oil prices hadn't worked to
cushion the decline,'' said Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with
Smith Barney Harris Upham &amp; Co., New York.
   Livestock futures posted modest gains, although some traders
stayed on the sidelines in anticipation of Thursday's U.S.
Department of Agriculture's report. The report is expected to show
slightly fewer cattle on feedlots than at the same time last year,
but some traders suspect the weights might be lower, indicating the
animals will come to market later.
   ``We've got record-high prices for beef at retail,'' said Chuck
Levitt, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., Chicago, ``but
complicating things is the fact that the trade doesn't have a good
handle on what demand is going to be like in the coming weeks.''
   Live cattle were .20 cent to .42 cent higher, with April at 77.77
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .32 cent higher, March
at 80.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent lower to .25 cent
higher, with April at 43.65 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies
were .10 cent lower to .58 cent higher, with March at 38.15 cents a
pound.
   Grain and soybeans prices closed mixed to mostly lower on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat was 3{ cents lower to 1 cent higher, with the contract for
delivery in March at $4.37{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents lower to }
cent higher, with March at $2.77 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1{
cents lower, with March at $2.08\ a bushel; and soybeans were 2{
cents lower to 2 cents higher, with March at $7.66{ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   The House passed legislation Wednesday that
would require a recalcitrant President Bush to name an emergency
panel to try to end the devastating Machinists union strike against
Eastern Airlines.
   The labor-backed bill was approved on a mostly party line 252-167
vote by the House, where most of the majority Democrats are
sympathetic to the airline's unions.
   Rep. Glenn Anderson, D-Calif., chairman of the House Public Works
Committee, said the measure ``offers the best hope of resolving the
current labor dispute, which threatens the survival of Eastern
Airlines.''
   But Rep. John Paul Hammerschmidt, R-Ark., ranking GOP member of
the public works committee, said the emergency panel was not needed
because, despite the strike, ``there is no national transportation
emergency.''
   The measure was considered a long shot to become law because of
opposition from the Bush administration. But House passage of the
legislation seems to score several political points for unions and
their Democratic allies.
   It forces Bush and his Republican supporters to resist a measure
that is also opposed by Frank Lorenzo, the chairman of Eastern's
parent company, Texas Air Corp. Lorenzo is a widely unpopular figure
on Capitol Hill, where he has been criticized by Democrats,
Republicans and even Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner for
his business practices.
   It focuses attention on Bush's refusal to follow the
recommendation of the National Mediation Board, which urged the
president to name an emergency panel on Feb. 24, eight days before
the walkout. Since 1926, the mediation board has asked presidents to
name emergency panels in 34 airline disputes and they have always
consented _ until Bush's refusal.
   It also demonstrates that labor, which was often battered during
the Reagan administration years, can still move legislation in
Congress.
   The bill would give the president one day after enactment to
appoint a board, which would study the dispute and offer a
recommendation to end the strike. While the board did its work,
there would be a cooling-off period of up to 26 days, during which
Eastern would have to pay pre-strike wages to its workers.
   Supporters say the neutral board's recommendations could offer a
face-saving way for the two sides to reach an agreement without
seeming to make concessions. If labor or management reject the
proposed solution, Congress could later impose it with separate
legislation, they argue.
   Opponents argue that an emergency panel is not needed because the
strike has caused inconvenience but not a national emergency. They
also say the board would have little chance of solving a bitter
battle that has been building for 17 months.
   The 8,500 members of the International Association of Machinists,
which represents mechanics, baggage handlers and other ramp workers,
walked off their jobs March 4. Eastern was seeking a new contract
with $125 million in wage and benefit concessions, while the workers
wanted $50 million in improvements. The airline said it was losing
$1.5 million a day before the strike, and has lost $1 billion over
the last decade.
   The airline's pilots and flight attendants have joined the
walkout, forcing Eastern to pare its 1,040-flights-per-day schedule
back to about 100. On March 9, Eastern sought protection from its
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code, making
the carrier's future murky.
   The bill would also require that the emergency board recommend
terms for new contracts between Eastern and its pilots' and flight
attendants' unions, both of whose contracts have expired.
   The legislation's future in the Senate is shakey because under
the chamber's procedures, a minority of lawmakers can kill a bill.
Bush has said he opposes the measure, arguing that labor and
management must work out a solution between themselves.
Administration officials have indicated Bush would veto the measure
should it ever emerge from Congress.

<TEXT>
   The parent company of Metromedia Long
Distance announced Wednesday it intends to buy ITT Corp.'s
long-distance telephone division, making Metromedia one of the five
largest long-distance carriers in the United States.
   Metromedia Long Distance did not disclose in its letter of intent
the purchase price for ITT Communications Services, Inc. The
proposed sale also would include ITT Chernow Communications Inc.,
the call-accounting equipment and services unit of ITT
Communications.
   ``Our goal is to grow the business, not only within geographic
segments, but with new products and services, and thereby better
serve our customers,'' said John W. Kluge, chairman of Metromedia
Corp.
   The long-distance division of ITT is concentrated in the
Northeast, Southeast and West. Metromedia Long Distance provides
service to parts of Texas, Florida and the New York-New Jersey area.
   ``They are a perfect complement to where we're located,'' said
Carole Smargon, a spokeswoman for Metromedia Long Distance.
   State and federal regulatory agencies must approve the
transaction, expected to be completed in the fall, Metromedia said.
   Ms. Smargon would not disclose the total assets of both
companies. Metromedia Long Distance has about 600 employees and ITT
Communnications has about 1,100, she said.
   Metromedia is a privately held partnership that owns and operates
companies in the telecommunications, robotic painting, computer
software and hospitality industries. It also owns a majority share
in Orion Pictures.
   Previously it owned one of the largest television station groups,
as well as major cellular-paging, radio broadcasting and outdoor
advertising operations.

   Federal safety officials announced Wednesday an
investigation of alleged rollover danger in Ford Bronco IIs, after
finding the Bronco fared worst in an accident study which cleared
the Suzuki Samurai of similar allegations.
   An engineering analysis, which is the second of three levels of
investigation conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration, will cover 1984-1989 Bronco IIs, an agency spokesman
said.
   Studies of vehicle fatalities showed the four-wheel-drive Bronco
II has had more fatal rollovers than other vehicles in its class,
even taking into account miles traveled and the number of vehicles
in use, said spokesman Tim Hurd.
   According to a Fatal Accident Reporting System study included in
a 1988 report on the Samurai, 43 Bronco II single-vehicle rollovers
caused fatalities, or 19 for every 100,000 vehicles. There were 8
Samurai fatal rollovers, or 6 per 100,000 vehicles; 13 involving the
Chevrolet S10 Blazers or GMC Jimmy, or 6 per 100,000, and 6 fatal
Jeep Cherokee rollovers, for 2.5 per 100,000.
   Ford Motor Co., in a statement from Detroit, said it believes the
record of its 590,000 Bronco IIs is not significantly different from
that of other utility vehicles.
   ``The Bronco II is a well-designed, safe utility vehicle, and
Ford believes that the accident statistics do not reflect any
safety-related defect in the vehicle,'' the company said, adding
that accidents in all such vehicles are ``strongly influenced by
adverse driver or environmental factors.''
   Spokeswoman Barbara Mansfield said Ford has done extensive
testing on the Bronco II to verify it has ``reasonable and
appropriate handling and stability characteristics.''
   Hurd, speaking for the highway safety administration, said, ``The
Ford Bronco II appears to have a higher number of single-vehicle,
first-event rollovers, particularly those involving fatalities.''
   ``In the process of studying rollovers, we began to get curious
about the Bronco,'' he said.
   Hurd said investigators will analyze rollovers involving the
sport-utility vehicle to determine if environment, types of drivers
or the vehicle itself might have contributed to the accidents.
   He said that although the call for an engineering analysis of the
Bronco II was formally based on letters to the safety
administration, it is also the result of the Samurai investigation
and extensive study into rollovers. He said there have been several
petitions for the agency to adopt rollover standards covering all
vehicles.
   Last August, the agency concluded that critics of the Samurai
failed to demonstrate the little truck has an excessive tendency to
roll over and denied a recall petition filed by the Center for Auto
Safety, a public-interest group often at odds with the auto industry
and its regulators.
   Consumer Reports magazine, in a July 1988 issue, also called for
a ban of the Samurai, saying ``it literally trips over its own
feet.'' The magazine's publisher, Consumer Union, petitioned the
safety administration to draft regulations to guard against
rollovers.
   In other action Wednesday, the highway safety agency announced
the start of several preliminary evaluations, the lowest level of
investigation. They included allegations of:
   _ Parking brake failures in selected models of 1980-84 Ford Motor
Co. cars.
   _ Exhaust gas intrusion into the passenger compartment of 1986-87
Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars, following 10 complaints; 795,000
of the vehicles were manufactured.
   _ Locking of the power steering mechanism in 1986-89 Ford
Aerostar vans, following seven complaints involving three, two
injuries and two fatalities; 350,000 have been built. were built Aero
   _ Possible heater hose misrouting which may cause fires in
ambulance conversions built by more than 40 manufacturers.
   In addition, the safety agency closed investigations into
unsubstantiated reports of:
   _ Broken drivers seats in 1984-87 Chrysler Caravan and Dodge
Voyager vans.
   _ Defective power steering hoses in 1986 Buick LeSabres.
   _ Steering column problems in 1988 F150 Ford pickup trucks.
   _ Steering damper separation problems in 1988 Chevrolet Blazer
and GMC Jimmy trucks.
