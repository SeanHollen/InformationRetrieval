<TEXT>
   The Black Hills gold-rush town where Wild
Bill Hickok was gunned down in an 1876 poker game begins
limited-stakes gambling this week in a bid to resurrect the boom
times of its frontier days.
   Players will be limited to $5 bets when gambling is ushered in
at high noon Wednesday, but the stakes are much higher for Deadwood.
   City leaders are betting that the blackjack, poker and slot
machines will draw more tourists and generate enough revenue to
finance restoration of Deadwood's crumbling brick buildings on
historic Main Street.
   Deadwood, known in frontier days as the wickedest, wildest place
in the West, was born in the 1876 gold strike and grew to 7,000
people in just seven months. Grand houses still perch on the steep
sides of Deadwood Gulch, forming a city seven blocks wide and three
miles long.
   Illegal gambling flourished as recently as the 1930s and '40s
and, until state and federal officials stepped in a decade ago,
houses of ill repute operated fairly openly.
   Now the town is down to about 2,000 people and depends on
tourists who come to see the No. 10 saloon where Hickok, a former
U.S. marshal, was shot, and the hillside cemetery where he is
buried next to Calamity Jane, a notorious local denizen. For many
travelers, this is just a side trip on the road west to Yellowstone
National Park, or up from Mount Rushmore, 50 miles south.
   The despair engendered by a decline in tourism in recent years
is giving way to excitement and investment, said Bill Walsh, owner
of the 85-year-old Franklin Hotel.
   ``Deadwood's going to be fun again. That I believe with all my
heart,'' Walsh said. ``We're returning to the good old times of
Deadwood, and if we do that, we're going to be successful.''
   One new investor is actress Rue McClanahan, of NBC's ``Golden
Girls,'' who is becoming a partner in Calamity Jane's Restaurant
and Art Gallery. She touted Deadwood on a recent appearance on
Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show.''
   The betting begins Wednesday in 33 licensed gambling
establishments.
   Officials expect a few initial glitches as everyone gets
accustomed to the fine points of the state's new gambling rules,
said Don Gromer, executive secretary of the state Gaming Commission.
   The most obvious problem will be a dealer shortage. Many
potential dealers applied late for their licenses, and there wasn't
enough time to complete the required background checks, he said.
   So far, only 90 people have received licenses necessary to work
as gambling employees. Owners of the gaming parlors have said at
least 200 dealers will be needed. The Gaming Commission will meet
Tuesday to approve some license applications filed the past few
weeks, aiming to issue licenses in time for Wednesday's opening.
   Voters statewide approved a constitutional amendment in November
allowing gambling in Deadwood and requiring that the city's share
of revenue be spent to restore historic buildings and other city
facilities.
   Deadwood voters gave final approval in April.
   It's hard to predict how much money the games will bring into
government coffers, Gromer said. He thinks Deadwood will get
$400,000 the first year, the state will get $500,000, and Lawrence
County will receive $100,000.
   Deadwood's gambling supporters realized their promotions must
focus on the town's frontier reputation and its most celebrated
character, Hickok, who was shot from behind while playing poker on
Aug. 2, 1876. According to legend, he was holding two pairs: aces
and eights, known as the dead man's hand ever since.
   Deadwood could develop into a strip of neon-lit gaming houses
like some Nevada towns, Walsh said. He would rather see the town
use its gambling prosperity to build good stores and fine
restaurants and become a center for the arts like Jackson Hole,
Wyo., and Aspen, Colo.
   By limiting bets and allowing no more than 15 games in each
establishment, Deadwood should be able to recapture its old-time
Western atmosphere and avoid a Las Vegas image, he said.
   Melodee Nelson, chairwoman of the promotional Deadwood You Bet
Committee, said gambling could give the city a year-round tourism
economy.
   ``It's exciting to be putting on extra help for November, when
you usually roll up the sidewalks,'' she said.

<HEAD>Rebels Kill Three Mayoral Candidates After Mock Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Left-wing guerrillas killed three candidates
for mayor of an Andean town after staging a mock trial in front of
the villagers Saturday, police reported.
   They said the guerrillas then went to a nearby town and murdered
two councilmen.
   Rebels of the Maoist Shining Path movement have stepped up their
attacks to sabotage nationwide municipal elections scheduled for
Nov. 12.
   At least 120 mayors, mayoral candidates and local officials have
been killed by the guerrillas this year and many others have
resigned because of death threats.
   Police said a band of guerrillas entered the town of Palca early
Saturday and dragged the three mayoral candidates from their homes.
   The victims were taken to the main square where the villagers
had been forced to assemble and after a brief ``people's trial''
each man was shot in the head.
   Police identified the three as Raymundo Rojas of the
center-right Democratic Front, Maximo Ribera of the United Left
coalition and Diogenes Flores of the governing center-left Aprista
party.
   Police said the killers then went to the town of Vilca and shot
to death two councilmen. Both towns are in the department of
Huancavelica, 155 miles east of Lima.
   Police did not say how many guerrillas were in the group.
   Officials said that in the town of Ayaviri, 610 miles southeast
of Lima, Shining Path rebels dynamited the house of Edgar Loayza,
candidate for mayor for the Democratic Front. They said Loayza was
not injured.
   The rebels have called for an ``armed strike'' in Lima on Nov.
3, meaning people who ignore the call and go to work face the
threat of violence.
   Lima mayoral candidate Henry Pease of the United Left said
Friday he would organize a public march that day in defiance of the
strike.
   Presidential candidate Mario Vargas Llosa of the Demoractic
Front praised Pease and called on other candidates in the municipal
and presidential elections to join in the march.
   Vargas Llosa, an internationally renowned novelist, is
considered the front-runner in the presidential elections, set for
April.
   Sen. Enrique Bernales, Lima mayoral candidate for the left-wing
Socialist Accord, said he would join Pease in the march.
   ``This shouldn't be a political march, it should be a civic
march,'' Bernales said in a radio interview Saturday night.
   ``This is something we cannot permit,'' he said, referring to
the guerrillas attempts to disrupt the elections.
   The government says more than 15,000 people have been killed in
violence related to the Shining Path's insurgency, which began in
1980.

<HEAD>Anti-Abortion Rally Draws Thousands in Ohio; 89 Arrested at Pittsburgh

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   An anti-abortion rally in Columbus, Ohio, drew at least 10,000
people Saturday, and 89 people were arrested in Pittsburgh at a
protest outside an abortion clinic.
   One of those arrested was suspected of knocking a police officer
to the ground, Lt. Thomas Neill said. The officer was not hurt, he
said.
   The others were charged with failure to disperse after blocking
the entrance to the Allegheny Reproductive Health Center, Neill
said.
   In Columbus, police estimated at least 10,000 people had
gathered for a pre-rally concert at a downtown park, the first in a
series of weekend events sponsored by both sides of the abortion
debate.
   ``There is a campaign around the country, with a lot of money,
and they're saying that America is changing its opinion on the
abortion issue,'' said J.C. Willke, national Right to Life
president.
   ``People think that this is a women's issue, but in actuality
it's a human issue,'' he said.
   Karrie Kulich, 15, of Orient, Ohio, carried a sign reading
``Stop the Slaughter.''
   ``My mom was going to abort me because she didn't want me,'' she
said. ``But thank God, she put me up for adoption. I'm grateful for
that, and that gives me special reason to be here.''
   A coalition of abortion-rights organizations planned to sponsor
a March for Choice downtown on Sunday.
   ``We see this as a kickoff to building a pro-choice presence in
this state,'' said Jill Spangler, co-chair of the coalition.

<HEAD>Communist Legislators Endorse Changing Party's Name</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Communist members of parliament on
Saturday endorsed a proposal to change the name of their party as a
way to expand it into a broader-based organization.
   The party is now called the Polish United Workers Party.
   The planned change, similar to one recently enacted by Hungarian
communists, is expected to be passed at the Polish party's 11th
congress, scheduled for Jan. 27.
   A caucus of the 299 communist members of parliament issued an
open letter Saturday saying ``The PUWP has already used up its
time. Therefore it is necessary to set up a new party, tailored to
the real needs and aspirations of the working people.
   ``The failure of prior methods of government and economic
management of the state is a fact.''
   A party Central Committee panel met Friday to discuss the draft
of the new party statute that will be submitted to party members
for discussion before the congress meets, the official PAP news
agency reported.
   It said there were 70 proposed names for a new party but did not
list any.
   A poll released at an Oct. 3 Central Committee meeting showed 72
percent of the members surveyed favored changing the name, charter
and program of the party, founded in 1948.
   The survey, which drew responses from 1.1 million of the 2.1
million party members, refuted the ``widespread view that our party
attracts slow-to-reform or conservative forces,'' party First
Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said.
   The Communists, who in August lost their iron grip on government
to a non-Communist prime minister and his Solidarity-dominated
administration, have been seeking a new image.
   They were trounced during elections in June, winning only the
seats guaranteed to the party, and face the prospect of free
elections within four years.

<TEXT>
   A family of five died of smoke
inhalation Saturday morning while trying to escape a fire in their
apartment.
   Four of the victims collapsed as they tried to escape from a
small bedroom of the apartment; the fifth, an 18-month-old boy, was
found on the bed, said Lt. Scott Cruser of the North Vernon-Center
Township Fire Department.
   ``They were right in front of the window. They were all piled up
on top of each other,'' Cruser said.
   Three of the victims were identified as John R. Proffitt, 23;
his wife, Lisa M. Proffitt, 21; and their 18-month-old-son, Joshua
Ryan Proffitt. Also killed were 5-year-old Christina M. Hubbard and
3-year-old Erica Nichole Hubbard, sisters born to Mrs. Proffitt
before she was married, Cruser said.
   The fire started in a small living room of the apartment and was
probably going for about two hours before the downstairs neighbors
summoned help at 6:41 a.m., Cruser said.
   ``We're presuming the man was asleep on the couch and he awoke
and went to the bedroom and opened the door. And when he did, it
just sucked all of the oxygen out of the bedroom because of the
intense heat,'' Cruser said. The bedroom was about 10 feet by 10
feet, he added.
   ``The fire was not that bad. It smoldered for a couple hours or
so. It was just a lot of smoke,'' Cruser said.
   All five died of smoke inhalation, said Jennings County Coroner
Harold Pickett.
   The cause of the blaze was not immediately clear, but it was
believed to have been electrical, Cruser said.
   North Vernon is about 50 miles southeast of Indianapolis.

   For just a few hours Saturday night,
hundreds of Oakland residents forgot the troubles of their
quake-damaged city, thronging into the streets to celebrate their
team's sweep of the World Series.
   Cars paraded through the downtown Jack Lonon Square, blaring
horns to a cheering crowd on the sidewalk after the Oakland
Athletics beat the San Francisco Giants 9-6 in four straight games.
   Some waved brooms and chanted, ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''
   Rubble from quake-damaged buildings still littered the streets
and just a few miles away the twisted concrete of the collapsed
Interstate 880 double-decked freeway stood as a silent memorial to
the 39 people who died there when the quake hit at 5:04 p.m. on
Oct. 17.
   But after nearly two weeks of depressing reports of destruction
and quake victims, this was a time for stress to be released.
   ``This city needs a celebration,'' James Meade said in a voice
hoarse from shouting. ``A little happiness helps us bounce back.
The quake was a tragedy and all, but this will get us moving back
down the road.''
   Two dozen motorcycle policemen kept a watch on the crowd, a few
of them adding their sirens to the already deafening roar of
celebration.
   ``People haven't been normal. They've been antsy, on edge,''
said Pat Mackey. ``Now here's a good way to relieve tension.''

<TEXT>
   Dr. Elizabeth Morgan, who spent
more than two years in jail for refusing to tell a judge the
whereabouts of her daughter, has agreed to a TV docudrama about her
story, a spokeswoman said.
   Morgan signed with Linda Otto of Lansburg Co., makers of
``Adam'' a television movie about a boy who was kidnapped and
murdered, Shelley Browning, an attorney who negotiated the deal for
Morgan, said Friday.
   Morgan, a plastic surgeon, has alleged that her former husband,
Dr. Eric Foretich, an oral surgeon, sexually molested their child,
Hilary, now 7.
   Foretich has vehemently denied the charges.
   Morgan was sentenced to jail in 1987 for civil contempt of court
by the judge presiding over their custody dispute. Morgan refused
to comply when the judge ordered her to allow Foretich unsupervised
visits.
   She was released two months ago from the Washington, D.C.,
prison after special legislation was passed by Congress.
   Ms. Browning said that Ms. Morgan will be a consultant on the
film and will wield ``final, absolute control over what appears.''
   Foretich, when informed of the movie deal, said Friday, ``I will
absolutely sue them if my name or my daughter's name is used
without my consent.''
   ``This will be a real-life story based on verifiable facts,''
using real names, including Morgan's and Foretich's, Ms. Browning
said. The Beverly Hills lawyer said she expects Foretich will sue.
``We are prepared,'' she said ``He has made himself a public
figure.''
   With Ms. Morgan as consultant, Foretich said, the movie will be
biased. ``We all know the slant of this particular movie, that goes
without saying.''
   Morgan's fee, an undisclosed amount totaling less than $250,000,
will go into a trust fund for Hilary, Ms. Browning said.

<TEXT>
   The Oakland A's sweep of the World Series
brought a welcome diversion to the earthquake-damaged Bay area
Saturday night, giving people a chance to celebrate in streets
rattled with fear less than two weeks earlier.
   Baseball fans honked horns and whooped it up in Oakland's Jack
London Square after the Athletics beat the cross-Bay rival San
Francisco Giants 9-6 to win the championship in a four-game sweep.
   ``There's nothing better than making a sweep of San Francisco,''
said Andy Mousalimas, owner of Kings X bar, which was crowded with
A's fans.
   Oakland became the scene of tragedy at 5:04 p.m. Oct. 17 when
the magnitude 7.1 earthquake collapsed double-decked Interstate
880, crushing cars and causing 39 of the temblor's 64 known
fatalities.
   San Francisco fans consoled themselves with other celebrations.
Thousands flocked to the 10th annual Exotic-Erotic Halloween Ball.
   ``Getting back to normal in San Francisco is like insanity
anyplace else,'' said Louis Abolafia, producer and co-founder of
the ball. ``People were ready for a release of all their pent up
feelings. Their houses are still shaking from all the continual
tremors. If it all falls down, at least it will go down with a
party.''
   The mood was more sober 70 miles south in Watsonville, a
hard-hit agricultural city in Santa Cruz County near the epicenter
of the quake.
   Hundreds of people displaced from damaged homes or fearful of
going back inside buildings still live in tents and Red Cross
shelters in Watsonville.
   ``We don't want to be here for a long time,'' said Josefina
Roja, 37, who has lived in a tent with her husband since the quake.
``But for now it's all right as long as it doesn't rain again.''
   State and federal officials, meanwhile, were considering scaling
back the hours of some centers where victims have been applying for
aid. They were also considering consolidating centers because of a
decline in applicants.
   The Disaster Application Center in Daly City had only seven
applicants Saturday and the Salinas center had only 14, said Rhonda
Brooks, spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   A total of 2,450 people applied on Saturday, 1,339 in person and
1,111 by a telephone hotline. That brought the cumulative
registration total to 26,541.
   FEMA said that of the total, 12,678 applied for disaster housing
assistance, 9,511 for individual or family grants to meet
disaster-related needs, 13,021 applied for Small Business
Administration home loans, and 5,750 applied for SBA business loans.
   The U.S. Geological Survey, meanwhile, reported that the earth
continued to move. A 3.1-magnitude aftershock hit at 2:28 p.m. PDT
Saturday.
   The USGS said there had been 80 aftershocks of magnitude 3.0 or
larger by 4 p.m. PDT Saturday, including 20 of magnitude 4.0 or
larger.
   A USGS statement said the probability of aftershocks decreases
rapidly during the first week after a quake, but then begins to
decrease more slowly in later weeks and months.

   A tsunami warning was issued in northern Japan
Sunday after the area was hit by an earthquake estimated at 6.5 on
the Richter scale, the Central Meteorological Agency said.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, police
said.
   Agency officials said the tremor occurred at 2:26 p.m. and its
epicenter was beneath the ocean about 6 miles off Miyako, a port
290 miles north of Tokyo.
   It said the quake registered three on the Japanese scale of
seven. An earthquake measuring three on the Japanese scale is
considered strong enough to shake buildings and knock over unstable
objects.
   The tsunami warning was issued along the Pacific coastal area in
northern Japan, the agency reported.
   Also known as seismic sea waves, tsunami are triggered by
undersea earthquakes, volcanoes, or in rare cases, landslides that
send a series of waves radiating to shores.
   The Richter scale measures the total magnitude of an earthquake,
while the Japanese scale measures ground motion at particular
locations.

   Police detained 355 people,
including 17 foreigners, during Saturday's rally for democratic
reform by more than 10,000 people marking the 71st anniversary of
Czechoslovak independence.
   Ten people were also injured in the melee that ensued when
hundreds of helmeted riot police swinging batons moved in on the
peaceful crowd. The injured were three policemen and seven
protesters.
   The official news agency CTK, giving the tally of those arrested
and injured, said the foreigners came from 11 different countries.
It did not identify any by either nationality or name.
   Official media accused U.S.-funded radio stations and Western
media of encouraging the rally, the largest anti-government protest
in 20 years.
   The peaceful protest began at 3 p.m. Saturday, when thousands of
Czechoslovaks defied warnings from communist authorities to stay
off the streets and rallied in memory of the proclamation of
Czechoslovak independence on Oct. 28, 1918.
   Police moved in swiftly after the crowd began chanting demands
for free elections and a new government. The helmeted riot squads
beat up several people, and made those detained stand spread-eagled
against police vans before whisking them away in waiting buses.
   ``We want no violence,'' protesters chanted as they were penned
in by riot police. ``We've got bare hands,'' they shouted, raising
their hands to show they were unarmed.
   CTK said police used ``mild means'' to break up the rally after
about 3,000 of the protesters ignored police loudspeaker warnings
to disperse.
   State television broadcast pictures of Western camera crews
filming the rally, and a commentator suggested they were partly
responsible for the demonstration.
   CTK accused the U.S.-funded radio stations Voice of America and
Radio Free Europe of helping to organize the protest. Their
broadcasts in Czech and Slovak can be widely heard in
Czechoslovakia.
   City streets and most bridges across the Vltava river that runs
through Prague were sealed off as sporadic demonstrations
continued. Sirens wailed through the city and dozens of police vans
raced through the streets.
   Police seized the film of several Western photographers.
   Hours before the rally began, the Communist government held an
official military parade on Wenceslas Square to commemorate Oct.
28, 1918, when the Czechoslovak state came into existence.
   The Communists took power in 1948, and Czechoslovakia remains
one of the East bloc's most rigidly controlled states.
   About 1,500 soldiers stood ramrod straight as Defense Minister
Gen. Milan Vaclavik instructed them to swear allegiance to defend
their homeland.
   Josef Kempny, head of the Communist-dominated Czech National
Council, stressed in a 15-minute speech the importance of
preserving Communist power and reiterated that the government will
not seek dialogue with independent, pro-democracy groups.
   ``There is no sense in debate with those who like to talk, but
who oppose February 1948 and are against socialism, who care only
for the return of capitalism and who try to distract our honest
workers from their work and to create chaos,'' Kempny said.
   His speech drew scant applause from an estimated 3,000
Czechoslovaks who were given special passes to be allowed through
police cordons and metal barriers for the ceremony.
   Three hours later, a crowd stood on the same spot, demanding
freedom and a new government.
   The crowd chanted the name of Tomas Garrique Masaryk, the
philosopher who founded independent Czechoslovakia, and cheered at
banners reading ``The Truth Will Prevail,'' and ``We Will Not Let
The Republic Be Disrupted'' _ a popular Communist slogan turned on
its head by the demonstrators.
   Protesters also chanted support for the Charter 77 human rights
group and for dissident playwright Vaclav Havel, the group's most
prominent member who was detained last week.
   After police began clearing the square, about 2,000 protesters
marched to the hospital where Havel, suffering from a bronchial
ailment, was taken Thursday after his detention.
   Another 2,000 demonstrators made their way to old town square,
which like Wenceslas is a historic rallying spot. They sang the
national anthem and chanted more slogans before riot police moved
in.
   A group of 3,000 to 4,000 young people moved to the Red Army
square, where hundreds of riot police again dispersed them.
   Last year, about 5,000 people rallied at Wenceslas Square on
Oct. 28 and were dispersed by riot police using dogs, water
cannons, tear gas and batons. At least 87 people were arrested.
   Last week, authorities arrested at least 11 dissidents to
prevent them from attending Saturday's rally, but activists said
others escaped the police dragnet to attend.
   Dissidents said before Saturday's rally that recent
demonstrations for more democracy in neighboring East Germany had
increased popular desire in Czechoslovakia to show the ruling
Communists people want more freedom.
   The government in Czechoslovakia, unlike its neighbors in
Poland, Hungary, the Soviet Union and now in East Germany, has
initiated only tentative reforms and refused dialogue with
independent groups.

   A double-decker ferry boat with 170
passengers aboard sank southwest of Rangoon, the Burmese capital,
and more than 60 passengers were reported missing, Rangoon Radio
said Sunday.
   The radio said the privately owned ferry sank Saturday in a
whirlpool about two miles from Dedaye, in the Irrawaddy Delta.
   It was unclear if the vessel was off the Burmese coast or in the
delta.
   The broadcast said 104 passengers were rescued, four bodies were
recovered by rescue units and search efforts continued for the 62
missing passengers.
   Major accidents involving ferry boats and coastal vessels occur
periodically in Burma. The vessels are frequently overloaded and
poorly maintained.

   CROWN MINES, South Africa _ More than 70,000 blacks gave a
tumultuous welcome Sunday to seven freed leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress at the largest opposition rally ever in
South Africa.
   ``Today, the ANC has captured center stage in South Africa,''
Walter Sisulu, 77, former general secretary of the group, told the
crowd.
   ``The ANC lives. It is amongst us,'' shouted union leader Cyril
Ramaphosa, one of the rally's principal organizers.
   Virtually every phase of the rally violated laws that make it a
crime to promote banned organizations. But the government allowed
the rally after approving the release of seven ANC leaders from
prison on Oct. 15.
   All but one of the freed men had been jailed since at least 1964.
   Police and soldiers set up roadblocks nearby and searched
vehicles, but no police were visible at the stadium.
   The crowd filled almost every seat in a soccer stadium recently
opened between Johannesburg and its main black township, Soweto.
   Cheers erupted when Sisulu and his colleagues walked onto the
playing field and circled the stadium behind an honor guard of 20
young militants, clad in khaki uniforms and marching in military
style. At the end of the parade was 80-year-old militant Oscar
Meptha, being pushed in a wheelchair.
   Another roar came when prominent activist Murphy Morobe read a
letter of greeting from exiled ANC president Oliver Tambo, who may
not legally be quoted in South Africa.
   Tambo said President F.W. de Klerk, who approved the prisoner
releases in hopes of encouraging black-white negotiations on a new
constitution, ``may yet earn a place among the peacemakers of our
country ... if he seeks the path to a genuine political
settlement.''
   But if he tries to perpetuate minority rule, said Tambo, de
Klerk ``will disappear forever in the dim mists of history.''
   In addition to the seven ANC leaders, the rally also honored
Govan Mbeki, who was released from prison in November 1987. Sisulu,
Mbeki and four of the other men were sentenced to life imprisonment
at a 1964 treason trial along with Nelson Mandela, the ANC's
best-known leader, who remains jailed.
   De Klerk took power in mid-August and has offered to negotiate a
new constitution within five years that would extend political
rights to blacks but protect white interests.

   A search continued Sunday for a commuter plane
with 20 people aboard that disappeared Saturday night on a
scheduled 35-minute flight from the island of Maui to the island of
Molokai, officials said.
   The Aloha IslandAir DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after leaving Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. (12:25 a.m. EDT
Sunday), said Don Early, air traffic manager for the Federal
Aviation Administration at the Honolulu Airport.
   There was no distress call from the plane's two-member crew and
no signals have been detected from an emergency locator transmitter
aboard the plane, said Sgt. William Bowker of the Joint Rescue
Coordination Center.
   The last radar fix on the plane was when it was two miles off
the northeast shore of Molokai, officials said.
   Two Coast Guard C130 search planes, two helicopters and two
cutters were dispatched to search the 3,000-square-mile area of the
Pailolo Channel between the two islands, said Chief Petty Officer
Dennis Hubbard, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   By early Sunday, the two helicopters and one C130 had been
recalled from the search area to await first light before rejoining
the search, said Petty Officer First Class Francesca Bozem at the
rescue center.
   Two Civil Air Patrol planes also were to join the search, she
said. Aloha IslandAir planned to send two aircraft to join in the
search at daylight, said Stephanie Ackerman, a spokeswoman for
Aloha IslandAir.
   Kahului is about 100 miles southeast of Honolulu.
   Searchers reported rain in the area was limiting visbility,
Hubbard said. The weather service said there were only scattered
clouds and 18 mph winds during the scheduled time of the flight.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of Aloha Airlines, was carrying
18 passengers and a crew of two, Early said. Thirteen passengers
are from Molokai, one is from Maui, two are from Philadelphia and
two are from Houston, said Ackerman. The names of the passenger and
crew were not released.
   About 10 police officers searched the coastlines of Maui,
Molokai and the island of Lanai ``looking for flares or any kind of
distress signal,'' said officer Peter Akuna at the Maui Police
Station in Wailuku.

   An Australian who claims to be the

for the 102nd time of not paying for a meal.
   Paul Charles Dosza, a 49-year-old unemployed chef, was sentenced

   Dosza stripped to his underwear in the restaurant and offered
his clothes as payment. Management refused and called the police.
   Dosza had been freed from jail Tuesday after serving a sentence
for a similar offense.
   He said in a televsion interview that he hoped to gain a place

   `Restaurants should be privileged I eat in them. Look at all the
publicity they get,'' he said.
   However, Magistrate Peter Mitchell dubbed him a ``habitual
criminal'' and ordered him jailed.

<HEAD>Party Leaders Gather To Honor Founder, Criticize West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party's top leaders gathered in a
weekend ceremony to honor one of the party's founders and call for
increase vigilance against the ``corrosive influence'' of the West.
   The rally to commemorate the 100th birthday of Li Dazhao was
reported in detail in the official press Sunday, with papers
carrying the full text of a speech by party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin.
   Jiang said it is necessary to cherish Li's memory at a time
``when external antagonistic forces are pursuing the strategy of
`peaceful evolution' and some people at home are advocating
bourgeois liberalization.''
   He added: ``It is necessary to use Marxism to battle the
erroneous tendency of opposing the basic theory of Marxism and
blindly following bourgeois ideologies of Western countries.''
   Jiang said party leaders must develop a ``real mastery'' of
Marxism and work to cultivate a great number of young Marxists.
   ``The younger generation especially should learn from Li Dazhao,
his firm beliefs and noble morality. It should inherit and carry
forward the fine traditions of the party while resisting the
corrosive influence of the decadent feudal and bourgeois
ideologies.''
   The speech, delivered before 1,000 officials in Beijing,
reflected the strongly anti-Western stance the government has taken
since spring when Chinese leaders ordered the military to smash the
student-led pro-democracy movement.
   Jiang and other leaders stress that China's open-door policy is
unchanged and that the country continues to urge Western
businessmen to invest in China. But at the same time they accuse
the West of trying to sabotage China's socialist system by bringing
about a ``peaceful evolution'' to capitalism and of contaminating
China with pornography, materialism and other social ills.
   Jiang praised Li for picking up some good elements from Western
capitalist countries while exposing the ``unconquerable
contradictions'' of capitalism.
   Others at the rally included Premier Li Peng and President Yang
Shangkun. It was chaired by Peng Zhen, an 87-year-old conservative
who formerly headed the National People's Congress.
   Li Dazhao, a librarian at what is today Beijing University, was
converted to Marxism after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and
took an active role in the 1919 May 4th Movement, China's first
student movement for democratic reform.
   He was one of the co-founders of the Chinese Communist Party in
1921 and is thought to have influenced the thinking of his young
assistant, Mao Tse-tung, with his views that the peasant class
should take the lead in the revolution.
   He was executed by a Nationalist warlord in 1927.

   Winds gusting to hurricane force swept parts of
Britain during the weekend, killing six people, sinking a Pakistani
freighter and driving a Nigerian fishing trawler onto rocks.
   The London Weather Center said gusts up to 100 mph were recorded
at the Portland Bill lighthouse on the south coast. It said the
storm was caused by warm air from the Mediterranean combining with
cooler air over the Atlantic.
   Another storm last weekend killed 13 people in the same region.
   Police said in the latest storm, four people died in
weather-related traffic accidents and two fishermen drowned in
Portsmouth Harbor on the south coast when their boat capsized.
   The coast guard said the 18,000-ton Pakistani freighter Murree
sank about 20 miles off the Devon coast in southwest England after
taking in water. They said Royal Navy helicopters rescued all 40
people on board.
   In the Shetland Isles north of Scotland, 33 people were rescued
from the 2,220-ton Azu, a Nigerian trawler.
   The coast guard said the Azu, from Lagos, was driven onto rocks
but was later refloated.
   The storms disrupted power in southwest England, leaving
thousands of people without electricity in Devon and Cornwall.

   Wilson, a member of a U.S. Air Force unit based in Kunsan near
Chonju, 150 miles south of Seoul, is in the custody of U.S.
military authorities.
   The shooting and a fatal street attack the same month by an

<HEAD>Education Minister Briefs Nixon on Student Policy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former President Richard Nixon met Sunday with
Education Minister Li Tieying for what the Chinese described as
frank and sincere talks on China's policy toward its students.
   Nixon, on the second day of a private visit as a guest of the
government, was briefed on China's ``practice of being kind-hearted
toward the students while setting strict demands on them,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The government has summarized its student policy in those words
since it used the army on June 3-4 to crush a pro-democracy
movement led by students.
   Li and other officials have said they will ``understand, educate
and unify'' most of the hundreds of thousands of students who took
part in the protests nationwide, while punishing only a small group
of leaders.
   In practice, however, all students have been required to report
their activities during the protests and undergo intense political
education. Hundreds have been arrested.
   Xinhua did not say how Nixon responded to Li's briefing, but in
diplomatic parlance, the words ``frank and sincere'' often are used
to describe talks where the sides disagree.
   The three-paragraph report said Li also discussed China's
educational exchanges with other countries, but it gave no details.
   An earlier, two-sentence Xinhua report on the meeting said
simply: ``They had a friendly conversation.''
   Nixon has not met with reporters or issued statements since
arriving for his sixth visit to China. Details of the trip,
including how long it will last, have been kept secret.
   Nixon's 1972 visit began a rapproachement that ended decades of
U.S.-Chinese hostility.
   Nixon's spokesman, John Taylor, said the former president came
``not to make news, but to have serious and extensive meetings with
Chinese leaders.''
   He would not specify which leaders Nixon will meet, but he is
expected to see senior leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Taylor said Nixon did not intend to try to mediate a solution to
the standoff between Washington and Beijing over China's violent
crushing of dissent and over the United States' decision to give
shelter in its embassy to two prominent Chinese dissidents, Fang
Lizhi and his wife.
   U.S. criticism of the June crackdown has been blasted as
interference in China's internal affairs, and U.S. and Western
culture are regularly condemned here as decadent.
   But Chinese officials have greeted Nixon as an old friend.
   At a banquet Saturday night, Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
praised Nixon for having shown the ``foresight and sagacity of an
outstanding statesman'' in 1972.
   ``At present, when Chinese-U.S. relations are at a difficult and
critical moment, he is paying his sixth visit to China, once again
showing his political foresight and courage,'' Qian said.

News Analysis ^With AM-US-Nicaragua ^By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is finding out, much as his two
predecessors did, that the problems of Central America are far more
resistant to solution than he had expected.
   On no foreign policy issue has Bush deviated as much from
President Reagan's approach as he has on Central America.
   While Reagan saw the emergence of the Sandinista government in
Nicaragua as a major security threat, Bush barely mentioned the
issue during the 1988 campaign.
   And as secretary of state, he chose a man, James A. Baker III,
who was perhaps more skeptical than any other in the top leadership
of the Reagan administration about the wisdom of providing military
support to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   By his actions, Bush has indicated he felt Reagan mishandled
Central America policy, just as Reagan believed President Carter's
policies toward that region invited disaster. Carter, of course,
felt the seeds of conflict there were sown by long years of U.S.
inattention to human rights abuses.
   The Central American issue seemed well on its way to a solution
with the end of U.S. military aid to the Contras 20 months ago and
the promise, at least, of a free and fair election in Nicaragua in
February 1990.
   But much of momentum toward an eventual settlement in Nicaragua
seemed to dissipate over the weekend when Nicaraguan President
Daniel Ortega announced, with some qualifications, that he was
calling off a cease fire his government had reached with the rebels
in March 1988.
   His timing seemed odd, coming as 17 heads of government,
including Ortega and Bush, were assembling in San Jose, Costa Rica,
for a hemispheric summit meeting to celebrate democracy.
   Ortega's main grievance is that the Contras, despite a series of
highly touted diplomatic breakthroughs dating back to August 1987,
seem not much closer to being dismantled now than they were then.
   And, as he stated forcefully in San Jose, the ``cease fire'' has
never been observed by the Contras. Ortega's asserts that 736
Sandinista soldiers, a rate of more than one a day, have been
killed during the supposed cease fire, a number viewed with extreme
skepticism by both U.S. and Contra officials.
   The Bush administration, on the other hand, believes it has gone
more than half way in addressing the concerns of Democrats and
others who opposed the Reagan approach.
   While Reagan had made the ouster of the Sandinista government a
high priority, the Bush administration has tacitly conceded that it
was willing to have a ``live and let live'' policy toward the
Sandinistas.
   Baker, for example, opposed any renewal of Contra military aid
and encouraged the rebels not to engage in military attacks against
the Sandinistas.
   Baker also distanced himself from the Contra civilian
leadership, refusing even to answer their correspondence, according
to Contra officials.
   The Bush approach bore almost no resemblance to what it was
under Reagan three years ago when the policy was being run by such
pro-Contra stalwarts as former national security aide Oliver North.
   The administration has made some concessions to the rebels. The
1985 trade embargo against Nicaragua remains in place and the
administration favors continued U.S. humanitarian assistance to the
rebels until after the Feb. 25 elections.
   Baker's reasoning was that if the Contras, stationed in camps
along the Honduran-Nicaraguan border, are demobilized before then,
Ortega would have no incentive to hold a fair election.
   Ortega, meanwhile, is giving the highest priority to ensuring,
through diplomatic pressure, that the Contras are indeed
demobilized by Dec. 5, the target date set earlier this year by
Central American presidents.
   The Bush administration has noted that the demobilization of the
rebels, according to the agreement, can only take place
``voluntarily,'' and that the deadline therefore is essentially
meaningless.
   The next big test for the administration comes at the end of
November when the $49 million aid package to the Contras comes
under congressional review.
   The aid program will continue through February but only if all
the congressional committees that deal with Contra aid give their
consent.
   The hand of Contra aid opponents probably was weakened by
Ortega's surprise announcement over the weekend, particularly since
it followed reports of continued large-scale Sandinista military
support for leftist rebels in El Salvador.

   Unofficial Soviet newspapers used to be
smudgy carbon copies, hand-typed and delivered by furtive couriers.
   Today, a frankly anti-communist weekly called Atmoda with
photographs and a color nameplate sells 165,000 copies every week.
Published by the 200,000-member People's Front of Latvia, Atmoda
advocates restoration of independence for the tiny Baltic republic
and an end to one-party rule.
   ``The truth is written there,'' said Rita Poradnika, 72, who
lines up each week to buy a copy in the Latvian capital of Riga.
``The Russian (official) newspapers print a completely different
story.''
   Atmoda, which in Latvian means ``awakening,'' is the largest of
many alternative publications popping up across the Soviet Union
under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or
openness.
   They are high-volume, public operations, a sharp contrast to the
unofficial publications of the past. Underground news journals
dealing with human rights issues, including the often repressed
Chronicle of Current Events, have existed for many years, but
largely clandestinely. Two years ago, dissident Sergei Grigoryants'
typewritten newspaper Glasnost became the first underground paper
to be publicly announced, but couriers who delivered it still
risked imprisonment.
   Now, a four-page privately operated economics newspaper called
Delim is selling 20,000 copies in the Soviet Far East. An
Estonian-language joint venture with the Swedish publisher Bonniers
sold out its first press run of 10,000 in early October. Even more
common are flimsy newsletters such as the eight-page Byelorusskaya
Tribuna. Many now are peddled at political gatherings by their
formerly underground publishers.
   Prosecution for publishing has virtually disappeared, though
local authorities sometimes seize editions and photocopying
equipment.
   Atmoda, published in separate Latvian, Russian and recently
English editions, specializes in articles that once sent publishers
to prison. A recent edition featured a draft constitution for an
independent Latvia.
   The paper regularly publishes stories designed to shatter the
Soviet version of Latvia's history.
   One denied claims that the republic's economy flourished under
communism.
   Another appeared under a banner headline trumpeting: ``Aug. 23,
1939 _ The Beginning of the Enslavement of the Baltics.'' There
followed an article on the signing of the Nazi-Soviet
non-aggression pact, which divided Poland and the Baltics between
Hitler's Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union. Within a year, the Red
Army had moved into Latvia, which then was annexed to the Soviet
Union.
   Atmoda has moved far deeper into once-forbidden territory than
the most daring of the official press, which were given a recent
tongue-lashing by Gorbachev.
   At an Oct. 13 meeting, the president accused editors of major
publications, including two popular weeklies, of setting political
passions afire without helping solve the problems they have
exposed, according to one of the editors.
   ``And they're loyal compared to us,'' Alex Grigoriev, editor of
Atmoda's Russian edition, said of the chiefs of the two weeklies.
   Given Atmoda's outspoken anti-party line, its editors profess
amazement that they have obtained access to tightly regulated
printing presses.
   ``The workers at the press and the more clever men in the
Communist Party support us, too,'' said deputy editor Janis
Krumins. ``They can see we are working for real solutions.''
   Atmoda is printed on a press run by the Communist Party of
Latvia, but Krumins said the newspaper has been asked to find a
different publishing house.
   ``It's getting embarrassing for them since we are
anti-communist,'' he said.
   Latvia's central planning department, which once controlled all
supplies, provides no newsprint for Atmoda. The newspaper does some
ingenious trading instead, Grigoriev said, but he refused to reveal
the source for fear it would dry up.
   Atmoda's staff is seeking another way of increasing its paper
supply.
   ``We're organizing recycling of old paper and contracting with a
factory to process it,'' Krumins said.
   The Russian edition, with a current circulation of 65,000,
focuses on news of pro-democracy and independence movements.
Krumins said Atmoda could sell 1 million copies of its Russian
edition throughout the Soviet Union if the government would permit
it to buy enough newsprint.
   Krumins claimed Latvian legislators have spotted Atmoda on
Gorbachev's desk.
   The Latvian edition is more locally oriented and more radical,
reflecting the tenor of its Baltic audience. One story reported
results of a poll that said 37 percent of Atmoda readers believe
independence from the Soviet Union is fully realistic.
   All this popularity has made Atmoda ``rich in rubles,'' Krumins
said, because it sells for 40 kopecks a copy, 10 times the price of
Pravda, the Communist Party newspaper. That has enabled Atmoda to
finance a reporting trip to Hungary to cover that country's
transition from Communist rule to a democracy.
   Foreign currency donations from Latvian emigres have provided
the cluttered Atmoda office in an ancient garret in old Riga with a
fax machine and three Apple computers.
   Atmoda is expanding its operation. It has rented a Riga movie
theater to show its video magazine and is negotiating for radio
time, Krumins said. Latvian-edition editor Elita Veidemane said the
organization also plans to start its own publishing house.

   Guerrillas bombarded the capital and a
missile base for a second day Sunday, killing at least four people,
and soldiers said the insurgents tightened their grip on roads
leading to the capital.
   The guerrillas claimed 19 people at a wedding party died when
the government shelled a guerrilla-held area of western Afghanistan.
   A spokesman for the Soviet-backed government accused the
U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas of ``cutting supply lines to
impose starvation on the people.''
   In the late afternoon, air force planes bombed guerrilla-held
areas in the Paghman mountains, about 15 miles northwest of the
city. The guerrillas fire rockets from these mountains at a Scud
missile base.
   The government acknowledged firing Soviet-made Scuds at the
Salang highway to drive out guerrillas. The route is the main
supply road from the Soviet Union to Kabul.
   At least 13 rockets hit Kabul on Sunday. One hit the grain
market in the old section of town, injuring one man. Several other
rockets crashed into residential areas, killing four people, the
government said. At least 13 other people were injured.
   It was the second straight day of heavy bombardment. More than
22 rockets hit the city Saturday.
   In Pakistan, where the guerrillas are based, the rebels' MIDIA
news agency said the bride and groom survived the shelling at the
wedding Friday but that 19 people, including six children, were
killed.
   The agency said the attack occurred near the Shindand air base
in Farah province.
   Soldiers and doctors at two hospitals said the Scud base was hit
numerous times but they had no reports of casualties. Rockets also
hit the international airport, forcing cancellation of one flight
to New Delhi.
   On Saturday, the airport was closed because of heavy shelling.
   Government soldiers with knowledge of the Salang fighting said
guerrillas were still holding large stretches of the highway on the
northern slope of the Hindu Kush mountains. Fighting has also
broken out on the southern slope, they said.
   More than 2,000 trucks carrying commodities such as flour and
gas for Kabul were said to be stuck on the highway, north of the
battles.
   Soldiers also said government troops had been forced to return
to Kabul from a southern road after a convoy of 200 trucks headed
for the embattled southeastern city of Khost was stopped just
outside the capital.
   A government official speaking on condition of anonymity said
guerrilla forces captured military positions near Khost, 25 miles
from the Pakistani border. The government was parachuting in
supplies, he said.
   In Kabul, streets were nearly empty at times and the usually
bustling bazaars had smaller crowds.
   ``I told my family to stay in bed today,'' said one man who went
shopping because there was no food in his house. ``The safest thing
to do is sleep.''
   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said the guerrillas'
policy to cut the city's food supplies was ``anti-human and
terroristic.''
   The guerrillas have said they want to cut off all food and fuel
supplies to Kabul, forcing the people to flee the city. Then, they
say, they will increase their attacks.
   Moscow, which sent in troops to back the Marxist government in
December 1979, finished pulling its troops out in February.

<HEAD>U.S. Delegating Problem-Solving Abroad</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States, once the world's most
popular mediator, is farming out the traditional role of peacemaker
and problem-solver to proxies around the globe.
   France has become the subcontractor for resolving the conflict
between the U.S.-backed opposition and the Vietnam-installed
government of Cambodia.
   Zaire has been tasked to mediate between the U.S.-backed rebels
and the Soviet-supported government of Angola.
   Egypt has been designated a go-between for feuding Israelis and
Palestinians.
   In Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and the Arab League have been charged
with mediating the 15-year Christian-Moslem strife.
   And in Eastern Europe, President Bush got the ball rolling by
proposing $119 million in aid for Poland and $50 million for
Hungary last June. But the U.S. contribution is going into a pot
organized by 24 countries and the initiative is being led by the
12-nation European Economic Community.
   This new trend in U.S. foreign policy has drawn praise and
criticism.
   ``The administration is acknowledging that it behooves us to act
less unilaterally and more in concert with other countries,'' said
John Steinbruner, Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the
Brookings Institution.
   ``But the laudable instinct of respecting other countries' views
descends into the not-so-laudable instinct of passing the buck,''
he added.
   Bush himself has put his finger on one of the reasons for
delegating authority to others, when he grumbled upon his return
from Europe last June that ``everybody wants the United States to
pick up the check for everything.'' They all assume ``we are
rolling in money,'' and at the same time foreign leaders are asking
the United States to balance its budget, he lamented.
   Critics cite less charitable reasons. ``Let's face it, this
administration does not have much imagination when it comes to
problem solving. It also makes decisions pretty slowly,'' said
Steinbruner.
   U.S. officials are still intimately involved in peacemaking, but
more like big brothers overseeing the process.
   Assistant Secretary of State Herman Cohen has shuttled to Africa
numerous times in recent months in an attempt to reconcile the
feuding rebels of Jonas Savimbi and the Angolan government after
Zaire's mediation ran into trouble.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III initially was inclined to
sit out the latest efforts to get Palestinians and Israelis to
discuss an election plan for the Israeli-occupied territories,
leaving it to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to bring the sides
together. He got involved last month when it appeared Mubarak's
efforts were stalled.
   But Baker decided to sit out the closing session of an
international conference on Cambodia in Paris last August because
participants failed to make progress in formulating a peace plan.
He left it to France and Indonesia, who co-chaired the conference,
to wind up the proceedings.
   ``There are situations, and maybe we now recognize it better,
that our involvement is unnecessary and even unhelpful,'' said
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, who served at the State Department and on the
National Security Council in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
   ``I view this not necessarily as a sign of decline, but rather
of maturity,'' he said. ``We'll continue to have our fingers in
lots of pies, even if it's not our entire hand. We're too big to
simply bow out.''
   The evolution of modern U.S. involvement abroad can be traced to
the post-World War II period, when the Truman administration
injected hundreds of millions of dollars to rehabilitate
war-ravaged Europe in the so-called Marshall Plan.
   It reached its peak under President Kennedy, whose policies
reflected a national impulse to do good around the world. His
presidency launched such lasting institutions as the Peace Corps,
which sent young Americans abroad to help developing countries, and
the Food for Peace program to provide American agricultural
surpluses to needy countries.
   The generally broad support for the extension of U.S. presence
abroad began to fray in the late 1960s, partly as a result of the
bitterly contentious American involvement in Vietnam.
   In the 1980s, public support for U.S. foreign aid and
involvement abroad has dwindled with the perception that the
European and Asian countries which rebuilt their economies with
generous U.S. support after World War II should now help bear the
burden of the world's problems.

<HEAD>U.S. and Soviets Resume Chemical Weapons Talks</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet and U.S. officials begin a new
round of talks Monday on reducing their vast arsenals of chemical
weapons, but the superpowers differ on whether to stop making the
deadly gases.
   The talks will be the first since President Bush and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze unveiled competing proposals
in September to scrap existing chemical weapons.
   Although both sides are calling for deep cuts in stockpiles, the
Pentagon is opposed to Moscow's insistence that the superpowers
also ban production.
   Continuing talks among 40 nations in Geneva also appear headed
toward a proposed treaty that calls for a ban on production.
   Max Friedersdorf will lead the U.S. delegation when the five
days of superpower talks begin in New York. Sergei Batsanov is the
chief Soviet negotiator.
   In his Sept. 25 address to the U.N. General Assembly, Bush
offered to cut U.S. chemical weapons stockpiles by 80 percent
immediately if the Soviets reduced their arsenal to the same level.
   Moscow admits it has 50,000 tons of poison gas. U.S. stockpiles
are currently estimated at about 30,000 tons of nerve gas. The Bush
proposal would leave the United States and Soviet Union each with
about 6,000 tons.
   A day later, Shevardnadze said the superpowers should go
further, and he challenged Washington to agree to stop making all
types of poison gas, including binary weapons, which are harmless
until two chemicals are combined just prior to use of the gas shell.
   Congress has approved money to continue production of binary
poison gas bombs and shells, and Bush administration officials have
confirmed they intend to continue production of the safer shells
even after signing a treaty phasing out the weapons.
   The Pentagon wants to phase out its single-element gas shells,
which are extremely dangerous if they leak due to aging or are
cracked accidentally. They would be replaced with binary weapons.
   The Soviets question the logic of agreeing to make massive cuts
in existing stockpiles while refusing to stop making the weapons.
   In a news conference Thursday, Batsanov said: ``From a practical
point of view, it could be called nonsense if you start destroying
your chemical weapons under an agreement and at the same time you
start producing new chemical weapons.''
   The Bush proposal calls for an immediate 80 percent cut in
stockpiles, a 98 percent cut within eight years and a 100 percent
elimination of stockpiles within 10 years.
   Although implicit in reducing all stockpiles is a ban on
production, Washington wants to reserve the right to resume
manufacture of chemical weapons. The Soviets claim they already
have stopped making the weapons and want the United States to do
the same.
   The U.S. and Soviet negotiators will be working on the basis of
a memorandum of understanding signed by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Shevardnadze during their talks in Jackson Hole,
Wyo., in September.
   The memorandum calls for a first phase in which both sides would
exchange information on their capabilities and allow inspectors to
visit designated military and civilian factories and storage sites.
   The second phase would involve the exchange of more detailed
knowledge, and surprise visits to production and storage sites.
   U.S. spokeswoman Caroline Dulin said the talks would cover the
mechanics of carrying out those commitments and would also take up
the differences in the Soviet and U.S. approaches to scrapping
chemical weapons.

   The burning wreckage of a missing commuter plane
with 20 people aboard was sighted in a remote valley on the island
of Molokai just before dawn Sunday, a fire department official said.
   ``They sighted the plane and the bodies. Our rescue team is
preparing to rappell into the valley to recover the bodies,'' said
Maui Fire Department Battalion Chief Steven Molina.
   Molina said there was no evidence of survivors.
   A Coast Guard plane sighted the wreckage in the Halawa Valley on
the east end of the island at 5:45 a.m., he said.
   The Aloha IslandAir DH6 Twin Otter failed to reach Molokai
Airport after leaving Kahului Airport at 6:25 p.m. Saturday (12:25

air traffic manager for the Federal Aviation Administration at the
Honolulu Airport.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of Aloha Airlines, carryied 18
passengers and a crew of two, Early said. Among those aboard were
13 residents of Molokai, including a group of youngsters who had
been on Maui to play volleyball, Molina said.One passenger was from
Maui, two were from Philadelphia and two were from Houston, an
airlines spokeswoman said.
   The names of the passenger and crew were not released.

   The first jet built
in Taiwan made an embarrassing public debut on Sunday when the
aircraft blew a tire as it prepared to take to the skies.
   The sleek fighter was rolling down the runway when the tire
exploded just 70 feet from a reviewing stand where President Lee
Teng-hui and other dignitaries watched.
   The fighter's nose and landing gear were slightly damaged but
the pilot was unhurt. Another jet took its place and completed a
five-minute air show without problems.
   ``That the accident was swiftly resolved proved our air force is
well-trained and the fighter has a sturdy design,'' President Lee
told a news conference at this air base in central Taiwan.
   ``The fighter accelerated to (143 mph) at the time and any plane
could turn over at such high speed,'' the pilot, Col. Wu Kang-ming,
said of the errant aircraft. ``Yet the fighter's strong side wings
helped slow it down.''
   Gen. Hau Pei-tsun, Taiwan's top military chief, said the
accident was a chance to further improve the fighter.
   When the prototype of the fighter was rolled out in December
after six years of development, President Lee christened it the
``Ching-kuo'' in honor of his predecessor, Chiang Ching-kuo, who
died in January 1988. The plane's official name is Indigenous
Defensive Fighter.
   Military officials say the fighter is similar to the American
F-16 and will eventually replace aged F-5E and F-104 fighters now
used by Taiwan.
   It was designed, the military has said, to meet possible air
threats from China and to ensure Taiwan's air superiority over the
Taiwan Strait.
   The Nationalist government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949 after
losing a civil war to the Communists, is still technically at war
with China.
   Officials said Taiwan plans to build 250 such planes at a total
cost of $4.2 billion.
   They say the fighter was designed and produced at Taiwan's
Chungshan Science Institute in northern Taiwan. But news reports
said it was built with technical assistance from several U.S.
companies, including General Dynamics Corp. and Garrett Turbine
Engine Co.
   The United States severed diplomatic ties with Taiwan in 1979 to
recognize China but continues to sell limited defensive hardware to
Taiwan.

   At least 20,000 East Berliners observed a minute
of silence Sunday for those killed while attempting to flee over
the Berlin Wall, the first such public mourning since Communist
authorities built the wall in 1961.
   The observance came as the East Berliners gathered in a downtown
square for a rally called by Mayor Erhard Krack to discuss reform.
Similar meetings were organized in the southern cities of Leipzig
and Karl-Marx-Stadt as part of a government effort to stop
activists from staging protests to voice their demands.
   All three cities have been shaken by large pro-democracy
protests in recent weeks. Protesters rallied in at least three
cities Saturday night.
   In East Berlin, microphones were provided for speakers from the
crowd, one of whom called for the minute of silence.
   ``We have to remember those who lost their lives in the
minefields and along the barbed wire and in the waters of the Spree
River just because once in their lives they wanted to see another
part of the world,'' said the man, who was unidentified.
   ``If the present reform course really leads to a better
socialism, it's at least necessary to remember those victims of a
policy of the past that never corresponded to reality,'' he said.
   East German authorities built the Berlin Wall in 1961 to prevent
the country's citizens from fleeing West. The wall's construction
was supervised by Erich Honecker, the hard-line leader who was
replaced this month after 18 years as party leader. He was replaced
by Egon Krenz.
   West German human rights groups say 191 people were killed
trying to flee East Germany from 1961 to 1988.
   The East Berlin dialogue session outside the old City Hall was
sponsored by the city's Communist leadership. It quickly became an
emotional forum in which Communist leaders were called to account
for a host of misdeeds and blunders. They were frequently greeted
with boos and whistles.
   The leaders were called to task on privileges accorded Communist
officials and were asked to respond to demands for election reforms
and allegations of police brutality against peaceful pro-democracy
protesters earlier this month.
   One worker demanded the Berlin Wall be torn down. ``It's time we
were allowed to go where we want,'' he said.
   An elderly man shouted to loud applause: ``Allow free elections
now!''
   Guenter Schabowski, East Berlin Communist Party chief and a
member of the country's ruling Politburo, drew applause when he
announced his support for ``approved and well-ordered''
demonstrations in the city.
   Schabowski conceded that ``demonstrations will remain in (East)
Berlin's political culture'' and said protesters and city officials
must work together to prevent an escalation to violence.
   East Berlin's police chief, Friedhelm Rausch, apologized to the
crowd for the brutal way that earlier protests in East Berlin were
broken up.
   Communist officials in recent days have appealed to protesters
to attend government-organized dialogue sessions rather than taking
to the streets to demand change.
   Despite the appeals, thousands continue to stage protests.
   Pro-reforms activists marched in at least three cities Saturday
night. The official ADN news agency reported 40,000 protesters in
Plauen, 10,000 in Rostock and 6,000 in Greiz.
   East Germany's rigid Communist line began changing after Krenz
took power Oct. 18. Since then, officials have launched an
unparalleled campaign of dialogue and openness aimed at winning the
public trust after years of denying the nation had any problems to
solve.
   Pro-democracy activists have been critical of the newfound
willingness for dialogue, saying the government is only interested
in reforms that do not challenge its monopoly on power.
   In an effort to address some of the most bitter complaints of
many East Germans, the government has promised to draft a new law
allowing greater freedom to travel West and has declared an amnesty
for all those who left the country illegally or who were imprisoned
after failed escape attempts.
   About 60,000 East Germans have gone to West Germany since July
via Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary.
   The new leadership has appealed to those who fled to come home
and pledged that no one will be punished if they do.
   Despite the pledge, East Germans continue to flee.
   Austrian officials said Sunday that more than 1,400 East Germans
crossed into their country from Hungary, en route to West Germany,
over the weekend.
   The majority of the East Germans going West have gone through
Hungary. Hungary opened its border to the West for the East Germans
on Sept. 10, the first country to do so.

   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Sunday she
fully supported Nigel Lawson during his six years as Britain's
treasury chief and tried to talk him out of quitting.
   But a flurry of public opinion polls taken after Lawson's sudden
resignation as Chancellor of the Exchequer suggests voters now
think less of Mrs. Thatcher. One poll showed a majority of voters
want her to step down as Conservative Party leader before the next
election.
   ``To me, the chancellor's position was unassailable. I always
supported him,'' Mrs. Thatcher said in a combative television
interview on London Weekend Television.
   ``Nigel had determined that he was going to put in his
resignation. I did everything possible to stop him but I was not
successful.''
   Lawson resigned his Cabinet post Thursday, saying he could not
continue to serve as long as Mrs. Thatcher retained her part-time
personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters. The Washington-based
Walters also resigned.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she told Lawson she believed advisers were
hired to advise and ministers to make decisions. But she admitted
Sunday ``I don't know'' whether Lawson would have stayed on if she
had fired Walters.
   The two men disagreed over monetary policy and Britain's entry
into the European Monetary System, a mechanism for stabilizing
European exchange rates. Lawson supported membership, but Walters
called the system ``half-baked.''
   During some heated exchanges, Mrs. Thatcher accused interviewer
Brian Walden, a former Labor Party lawmaker, of being
``domineering'' and trying to get her to accept blame for Lawson's
resignation.
   ``It is not a question of blaming anyone,'' she insisted.
``Nigel was a very successful, brilliantly successful, chancellor
for six years. Of course I know that one day he would go ... I
didn't expect it to happen this way or as soon.''
   Mrs. Thatcher rejected Walden's suggestions she was unyielding
and authoritarian, saying: ``Nonsense. I am staying my own sweet
reasonable self.''
   However, a Gallup poll published in the pro-Conservative Sunday
Telegraph found that 47 percent of voters polled and 24 percent of
Conservatives thought less of Mrs. Thatcher following Lawson's
resignation.
   Eight-two percent of all voters and 69 percent of Conservatives
believed Lawson's departure had reinforced Mrs. Thatcher's
reputation as sometimes being ``bossy and dictatorial,'' the poll
said.
   Thirty-eight percent of Conservatives and 72 percent of all
voters in the poll said Mrs. Thatcher was ``beginning to lose
control of the situation.''
   The Observer, a liberal newspaper, said in an editorial that
Mrs. Thatcher's style was beginning to resemble ``the Upas tree, a
venomous Javanese bush so powerful that it destroys everything it
touches.''
   British Broadcasting Corp. television surveyed 125 Conservative
lawmakers by telephone and said 39 percent believe Mrs. Thatcher
should change her leadership style while 52 percent do not.
   A poll in The Mail on Sunday suggested 54 percent of voters
think Mrs. Thatcher should step down as Tory leader and let someone
else lead the party into the next election expected in 1991. The
Mail said that was Mrs. Thatcher's lowest personal rating since she
was voted into power in 1979.
   The Sunday Correspondent's poll taken before Lawson's
resignation said the opposition Labor Party had the backing of 50
percent of British voters, a full 15 percent more than the
Conservatives.
   Others put the Tories from six to 10 points behind Labor, and
said their samplings gave the main opposition party 47 percent to
48 percent of voter support.
   The newspapers did not give the margins of error of their polls.
Sampling sizes varied from Gallup's 505 voters to The Mail on
Sunday's 1,043.
   In a speech Saturday night, Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey
Howe indirectly warned Mrs. Thatcher that she could not ignore
Britain's commitment to become a full member of the European
Monetary System.
   Mrs. Thatcher agreed in June that Britain would join the system
``when the time is right,'' and reiterated Sunday she is waiting
for other European countries to permit the freer movement of
capital before signing on.

<TEXT>
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun
convened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday to discuss
the situation in Lebanon after hints he may dissolve Parliament to
torpedo an Arab peace plan.
   Aoun rejected the pact because it fails to include a timetable
for the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000 troops in Lebanon, and he
branded Lebanese lawmakers traitors for approving it.
   ``The Cabinet in an extraordinary session under Gen. Michel Aoun
discussed the political situation in Lebanon and abroad,'' a
statement issued by Aoun's three-man military Cabinet said.
   ``The Cabinet has made adequate arrangements,'' it said, without
elaborating.
   Over the past week, Aoun repeatedly has hinted he may dissolve
Parliament to prevent it from formally ratifying the peace pact,
which was approved by Lebanese lawmakers who met in Saudi Arabia
last week.
   The pact, aimed at ending Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, must
be approved by a Parliament session in Lebanon to take effect.
   Aoun has the legal power to dissolve Parliament because he heads
the interim government formed by outgoing President Amin Gemayel in
September 1988.
   His Cabinet vies for power with a rival body headed by Prime
Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   The Arab League has called for Parliament to convene by Nov. 7
to ratify the agreement and elect a president.
   But Parliament cannot elect a new president without a quorum of
deputies, and most have not returned to Lebanon from Saudi Arabia
because they fear Aoun will have them arrested.
   ``The deputies, especially the Christians, are obviously afraid
to return lest the general hold them hostage to block a quorum in
an election session,'' said the Al-Anwar newspaper in an editorial
Sunday.
   ``Unless the Arab League finds a solution, it seems there will
be no election or peace accord,'' it said.
   In addition to clearing the way for a presidential election, the
accord would give the Moslem majority in Lebanon more power in
government.
   Aoun rejected the accord because it did not meet his demands for
a deadline for the withdrawal of Syrian troops, who were deployed
in Lebanon in 1976 to quell fighting in the civil war.
   Aoun says the Syrians broke their agreement by siding with the
Moslems in the war and he has vowed to drive them out.

   L. Douglas Wilder, who created a political
fund named for the ``underdog'' label he wore four years ago as a
black politician in the South, is campaigning like a front-runner
for Virginia's top office.
   ``We've come a long ways,'' said Wilder, the state's 58-year-old
Democratic lieutenant governor, remembering his 1985 campaign that
was all but written off by political pundits because of his race.
   But Wilder's opponent for governor, Republican J. Marshall
Coleman, seems equally confident of victory on Nov. 7.
   ``The momentum is on our side,'' Coleman, 47, said at a luncheon
in the Shenandoah Valley, a rural region where he grew up and
represented in the General Assembly before winning election as
attorney general in 1977. Coleman lost a 1981 bid for governor to
Democrat Charles Robb and is now a lawyer.
   A Virginia Commonwealth University poll released Thursday showed
Wilder leading Coleman 44 percent to 38 percent. The poll had a 5
percent margin of error, meaning the race is too close to call, and
it was taken before the last TV debate between the candidates on
Oct. 19.
   Coleman appears to have gained momentum since the debate,
largely because his performance was better than in the first TV
debate with Wilder on Oct. 9, said Larry Sabato, a University of
Virginia political analyst.
   Wilder, speaking last week to a banquet hall crowd of 400
supporters in the Roanoke Valley, recalled that Sabato predicted
four years ago that his bid to become Virginia's first black to
hold statewide office would doom the entire Democratic ticket,
which went on to sweep the state's top three offices.
   ``Now that analyst says the race is mine to lose,'' said Wilder,
who would become the first elected black governor of a U.S. state
if he wins.
   Coleman will bring President Bush for a campaign visit here and
in Norfolk on Friday, a move that Wilder's aides described as the
action of a desperate campaign.
   But Coleman countered by telling campaign volunteers at a rally
Thursday, ``I challenge my opponent to bring his candidate for
president to the state.'' Bush defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis
last year 60 percent to 40 percent in Virginia.
   Coleman had public appearances last week with two members of
Bush's Cabinet, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady, as well as former President Reagan's
defense secretary, Caspar Weinberger.
   On television, the Coleman campaign is going after Wilder on
character questions. The ads cite the Virginia Supreme Court's 1978
reprimand of Wilder, who has a Richmond law practice, for
mishandling a civil case.
   Also, the GOP candidate has a commercial about a vacant row
house that Wilder used to own. The house drew attention in the 1985
campaign after neighbors complained that its dilapidated condition
diminished the value of their property and that Wilder refused to
repair the dwelling.
   Coleman also has taken up taxes as an issue, citing the state's
biggest tax hike in 20 years under the present Democratic
administration of Gov. Gerald L. Baliles, who is barred by law from
serving a second consecutive term.
   If the state's fiscal picture turns sour, Coleman said, the
Democratic majority in the General Assembly might raise taxes. He
has pledged to veto any tax increases that are not submitted to a
public referendum.
   ``What I want to do is hold the line on taxes,'' Coleman said in
an Oct. 12 degate. ``As a Democrat, he can be expected to raise
taxes.'' Wilder responded, that is record ``is clear for tax
relief,'' adding that he has fought for years to repeal the sales
tax on food and non-prescription drugs.
   Wilder, meanwhile, has raised questions about Coleman's ties to
prominent northern Virginia real estate developer Dwight Schar.
Schar, the largest contributor to Coleman's campaign,
unsuccessfully sought rezoning in 1984 for a Fairfax County office
project on a site that was designated residential.
   Wilder said the episode showed that Coleman, who was Schar's
attorney and had a financial stake in the office development, was
not concerned about the region's severe traffic congestion.
   Wilder also has continued a television advertising blitz
directed at Coleman's opposition to abortion. One ad shows a woman
who says she is a Republican who opposes Coleman because of his
abortion views.
   The woman, Jean Durfee of Annandale, voted in the June 13 GOP
primary but also voted in the state's Democratic presidential
primary last year, said Mike Salster, communications director for
the state Republican Party.
   Coleman has said he will not press for changes in the state's
abortion law, but his supporters acknowledge he has been hurt by
the issue, especially in the populous Washington, D.C., suburbs.

<HEAD>Romans Vote in Mayoral Election With National Overtones</HEAD>
<HEAD>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of thousands of Romans began voting Sunday
in a two-day mayoral election seen as a barometer of the popularity
of Italy's political parties.
   About 2.3 million citizens were eligible to vote for the new
80-member City Council, which in turn elects a mayor. Several
newspapers expressed concern about a possible low turnout due to
dissatisfaction with city politicians.
   Since July, Rome has been run by a special commissioner named by
the national government, because Christian Democrat Mayor Pietro
Giubilo resigned in the wake of charges he steered city contracts
to friends. He denied he had done anything wrong.
   Voting booths were open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday and from 7
a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday. Preliminary results were expected Monday
evening.
   The campaign was dominated by debate over a call by a top
Vatican administrator to vote for Italy's only Roman
Catholic-affiliated party, the Christian Democrats.
   Despite the request by Cardinal Ugo Poletti, the papal vicar for
Rome, the Christian Democrats were expected to drop from the 33
percent of the vote they obtained in city elections in 1985.
   The Christian Democrats have dominated Italian national politics
since World War II, and a poor showing in Rome would be a setback
for Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat whose
close allies have headed the city's coalition governments in recent
years.
   Reflecting the importance of the vote, Andreotti and other
national party leaders stumped for mayoral candidates.
   Voters could choose from nearly 1,500 candidates for city
council, divided into 23 parties, ranging from Socialists to a
group called Rock for Growth. They also voted for local government
councils.
   Reflecting increased voter concern about the environment, the
Greens party was expected to surge from the 2.7 percent of the vote
it captured in the 1985 elections.
   The Communists, Italy's second-biggest party who governed Rome
for the first time from 1976 to 1985, were expected to get less
than the 30.8 percent they had in the 1985 polls.
   The Socialists, the second-biggest party in the national
coalition government, hoped to improve from the 10.3 percent they
clinched in 1985.
   Other issues prominent in the campaign were Rome's severe
traffic problem, pollution and social services.
   In an apparent effort to catch the imagination of disgruntled
voters, political parties led their lists of candidates with
figures of national standing, including government ministers.
   They also focused more on personality, emphasizing the top
candidates on the list _ the would-be mayors _ rather than simply
plugging the party's general ideology, as is the custom in Italian
politics.
   About 88 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the last
mayoral elections.

<HEAD>Little Chance of Bush Winning Veto Power in Court, Scholars Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush has little chance of winning a
contemplated court battle if he exercises a line-item veto without
congressional authorization, legal scholars say.
   While the move may be politically appealing, these experts say,
the Constitution and legal precedent offer scant support for such
use of presidential power.
   ``It's kind of a dead duck,'' said Georgetown University law
professor Charles Abernathy. ``I'm surprised anyone in the White
House would float that.''
   Bush, as did President Reagan before him, supports a
constitutional amendment permitting him to veto individual items in
a bill while leaving the rest intact.
   But White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush may not
wait _ may choose to veto an item in some bill ``to see if it
works.''
   ``We are looking for a vehicle that might be a suitable test
case, but at this point we don't have one,'' Fitzwater said.
   The proposal has never been popular with Congress, whose members
prefer to bargain for favorite programs without the threat of
presidential interference.
   A line-item veto ``is an idea that many of us would resist very
diligently,'' said Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of House
Judiciary Committee's civil and constitutional rights subcommittee.
   Although the Supreme Court has never addressed the
constitutional issue head-on, debate over the legitimacy of the
line-item veto is nothing new.
   The first hint of the controversy may have arisen when President
Thomas Jefferson nearly two centuries ago temporarily blocked a
$50,000 appropriation by Congress for 15 gunboats on the
Mississippi River.
   President Richard M. Nixon used a similar tactic when he
impounded federal funds allocated to the states to fight water
pollution. But six months after Nixon left office, the Supreme
Court in 1975 ruled unanimously that he had exceeded his authority.
   The court said withholding the money Congress had voted to spend
was not authorized by law.
   Abernathy, the Georgetown professor, said the 1975 decision has
a bearing on the line-item veto.
   ``The court held there was no authorization by law for the
president not to spend money Congress had appropriated. The
line-item veto is the same thing,'' he said.
   Other scholars agree.
   ``This is truly an easy question,'' said Duke University law
professor Walter Dellinger. ``The president has the authority to
veto bills. He does not have any authority to veto part of any
bills. The president's power is to accept or reject whatever bills
Congress submits. It's not an authority to rewrite legislation.''
   Adds American University law professor Thomas Sargentich, who
specializes in separation of powers issues: ``There isn't a firm
case on the line-item veto because people have assumed it can't be
done.''
   Sargentich said the Constitution gives the president ``an up or
down vote on the entire bill just as the Congress has to vote up or
down on the bill. There's no indication in history that would
permit selective alteration by the president.''
   Advocates argue that the line-item veto is needed in time of
runaway budget deficits to curb congressional excesses and
pork-barrel legislation.
   So-called Christmas tree bills that hand out a wide range of
unrelated goodies violate the intent of the Constitution's framers
to limit legislation to specific subjects, they say.
   Dan Popeo of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation said a
test case could be won if ``Bush has the backbone'' to force the
confrontation.
   Popeo was unable to cite any court ruling to support his
prediction, but said a legal showdown over the line-item veto is
``a good bet for George Bush.''
   ``The legislative branch puts itself at great risk by allowing
the judiciary to review its powers,'' Popeo said.
   The National Academy of Public Administration, a non-partisan
research group, said in a study released last year that the
line-item veto, if ever adopted, could backfire.
   It would increase political confrontations and send lawmakers
searching for ways to neutralize it, the academy said.
   ``The item veto is not a simple, politically neutral device for
bringing about economy and efficiency in government. It is first
and foremost a political instrument,'' the group said.
   The constitutions of 43 states permit governors to use such
vetoes. But in many cases the provisions are coupled with a
requirement for a balanced state budget.
   Most states have come up with various ways of softening the
impact of the line-item veto, such as permitting the legislature to
recall a bill for a compromise adjustment.
   Some critics of the Bush administration think the president may
be willing to exercise a line-item veto despite doubts over its
constitutional validity because any legal challenge might not reach
the Supreme Court for years.
   ``Conservatives could have a field day,'' said Rep. Edwards.
``They think they could get several years of line-item vetoes.''

<TEXT>
   The quake that left at least 1,000
people homeless here deepened the long-standing fissures in the
relations between authorities and the majority Hispanic population,
community activists said.
   Hispanic leaders complain the city left them out of post-quake
planning sessions, prompting them to file a complaint with the U.S.
Attorney General's office last week.
   ``We've had a long history of neglect and discrimination here in
Watsonville,'' said Cruz Gomez, a local activist and City Council
candidate. ``We historically have been left out of the political
process and are accustomed to lots of promises and no action.''
   Cruz confirmed the complaint was filed and that Department of
Justice mediators were meeting with Watsonville's Hispanic leaders.
   Hispanic residents left homeless by the disaster charged the
city was unresponsive to their post-quake needs. Community
activists said most of the 1,000 to 3,000 people left homeless in
the agricultural city of some 28,000 residents were low-income
Hispanics.
   The city initially failed to dispatch Spanish-speaking rescue
workers to help Hispanics and didn't distribute literature in
Spanish explaining relief programs, said Bernardo Arellano.
   Arellano was left homeless in the Oct. 17 quake and has lived in
a tent since then. ``I didn't even see anyone from the city until
about a week later,'' he said.
   ``We keep hearing about how everyone has been helped in San
Francisco and how they are all right now. I'd like to think that
the reason we're still outside isn't because of racial
discrimination,'' he said. ``But I don't know what else to think.''
   Arellano, 23, said he and other low-income Hispanics who toil in
the fields fear long-term housing needs will be ignored as well.
   City officials adamantly denied charges of neglect and
discrimination and said they've been doing everything they can to
help everyone affected by the quake. People like Arellano are still
in tents because they have refused offers to live in enclosed
shelters, like the large auditorium at the Santa Cruz County
Fairgrounds, they said.
   ``Any distrust in the Hispanic community is being fermented by
certain people and organizations I'd rather not name,'' said City
Manager John Radin. ``There are always a few bigots, but there has
never been any real discrimination here in Watsonville that I've
seen.''
   State Sen. Henry Mello, a Democrat born and raised in
Watsonville, maintained the city ``doesn't have any more racial
prejudice than anywhere else.''
   Despite official disclaimers, complaints about institutional
racism and post-quake abandonment were expressed by diverse members
of the Hispanic community, particularly by the new residents of
Callaghan Park.
   There, in the park at the entrance to the city, some 200
low-income Hispanics have erected about 45 tents. The tent dwellers
shower at the local YMCA or in the homes of friends. They cook on
barbeque grills or butane gas stoves.
   The stand-off at the tent city is the result of a legacy of
neglect, Hispanic activists said.
   ``There certainly has been a problem in the past on the part of
the city in terms of responsiveness to the Latino community,'' said
Joaquin Avila, a Fremont attorney who represented Gomez and others
in a federal lawsuit that charged the city's voting system
discriminated against minority candidates and voters.
   Watsonville's aggressive downtown redevelopment displaced a
disproportionate number of Hispanic business owners, said Avila.
The city has lagged behind in hiring workers and appointing board
and commission members who reflect the city's majority Hispanic
population, he said.
   The 1980 U.S. Census showed 48 percent of the city's residents
as Hispanic. State officials and local activists estimate that
figure is now closer to 55 to 60 percent.

   Venus and the crescent moon will make a
brilliant pair in the evening sky Thursday, offering delightful
viewing if the weather is clear.
   The planet Venus is the brightest ``star'' in the sky, and will
be visible in the southwest as night falls.
   It will be shining close to the thin crescent moon, making for a
dramatic view, reports Sky &amp; Telescope Magazine.
   Millions of people went outdoors to watch a similar event in the
spring of 1988, according to the popular astronomy magazine.
   At sunset, the planet will appear to the right of the crescent
moon. Also visible should be Saturn, to the upper left, though it
will be much fainter.
   With luck, the magazine adds, viewers may be able to observe the
phenomenon of ``earthshine.''
   That is the reflected light from the Earth brightening the
normally dark portion of the moon so it becomes visible, although
not as bright as the crescent portion which is lighted by sunlight.
   Because the dark section of the moon glows dimly gray when this
occurs, it has been called ``the old moon in the new moon's arms.''
   Though Venus and the moon look close together at this time, they
are really more than 65 million miles apart.

   A militiaman of the Israeli-backed South
Lebanon Army was wounded Sunday when the armored personnel carrier
he was riding hit a mine in Israel's self-designated ``security
zone'' in south Lebanon, police reported.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing

mountain town of Jezzine. The extent of the militiaman's injuries
was not known.
   Israel established the 328-square-mile border zone in June 1985
when it withdrew the bulk of its invasion army from Lebanon after a
three-year occupation.
   The strip, manned by Israeli troops and the mainly Christian
SLA, serves as a buffer against guerrilla attacks on Israel.

   Blacks and Hispanics were about twice as
likely to be crime victims as whites last year, the Bureau of
Justice Statistics said Sunday.
   While whites were robbed at the rate of 4.7 per 1,000 people
during 1988, the rate for blacks was 9.4 and for Hispanics, 10.1,
according to the bureau's National Crime Survey.
   Males, young people, inner-city residents and renters also were
more likely to have been crime victims last year.
   The rates of violent crimes and personal thefts increased last
year for the second straight year but remained below the high rates
of the 1970s and early 1980s, the bureau said.
   The bureau said those two categories of crimes rose 3.1 percent
last year from 1987.
   Crime rates were highest in the West _ 126 personal crimes per
1,000 persons and 224 household crimes per 1,000 households. The
Northeast had the lowest rates _ 73 personal crimes per 1,000 and
115 household crimes per 1,000.
   The National Crime Survey figures for 1988 were based on
interviews with 101,000 people 12 years or older in 50,000 homes.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told American sailors
on an aircraft carrier Sunday that the ``Soviet empire'' may be
crumbling but that the United States should not make any changes in
its military strategy in Europe.
   Cheney, on a three-day trip to Italy, also told journalists that
Washington still wants to put a NATO wing of F-16 fighter jets in
Italy despite the reduction in the Soviet military threat.
   There has been some controversy in Italy over accepting the
planes, which the Spanish government has ordered out of a base near
Madrid.
   ``As we meet here today, a fundamental change may be under way
in the world,'' Cheney told 1,500 sailors on the USS America, a 6th
Fleet aircraft carrier off the French island of Corsica in the
Mediterranean. ``We may in fact be witnessing the disintegration of
the Soviet empire.''
   The defense secretary toured the ship and met with the commander
of the 6th Fleet, Vice Adm. J.D. Williams, and the commander of
U.S. naval forces in Europe, Adm. Jonathan Trumbull Howe.
   He also shared a cafeteria lunch with crew members and cut a
cake welcoming him.
   Speaking to journalists, Cheney said moving the squadron of
F-16s to a base at Crotone in southern Italy was essential.
   ``We're still going to need the 401st at Crotone, even if you
get a CFE (Conventional Forces in Europe) agreement between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact,'' he said.
   ``You're not going to alleviate the requirement to have
significant air power in the southern flank of NATO.''
   The Italian government voted last year to accept the F-16s, over
the protests of the Communists, Italy's second-biggest party and
the main opposition group.
   Cheney also said he was sure the United States would find money
to pay the part of the moving costs that NATO assigned Washington.
   On other subjects, Cheney said the Defense Department would like
to add a 15th aircraft carrier to its forces, but the possibility
depended on the defense budget.
   ``You can't go to 15 carrier groups at the same time that
Congress continues to cut several billion dollars a year out of the
budget,'' he said.
   On Monday, Cheney was scheduled to meet Premier Giulio
Andreotti, President Francesco Cossiga and Defense Minister Mino
Martinazzoli.

<HEAD>Barney Frank Defense Fund Just Getting Started</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Supporters of Rep. Barney Frank's fight to
survive a sex scandal can now vote with their wallets for the
veteran House Democrat from Massachusetts.
   As the House ethics committee prepares to begin its
investigation of Frank _ possibly as soon as this week _ a legal
defense fund to help Frank defray costs is just up and running,
according to Dick Morningstar, a longtime Frank booster and fund
raiser.
   Much of the money will go to high-profile Washington attorney
Stephen Sachs, a former Maryland attorney general.
   ``It's just getting off the ground,'' Morningstar said in a
telephone interview from his Cambridge, Mass., office last week.
``My sense is it will do well.''
   Donors can give up to $1,000 to the defense fund. But if they
donate the legal maximum, they cannot also contribute to Frank's
political campaign. An individual giving to both funds can give no
more than $1,000 total.
   Morningstar said there will be no fund-raisers for the legal
defense fund. ``It will be an attempt to get help from old
friends,'' he said.
   Frank has made no announcement about whether he plans to seek a
sixth term in Congress. But he is giving every indication he plans
to defend himself against what he calls ``vicious lies'' by Stephen
Gobie.
   Gobie is the male prostitute that Frank admits he hired for sex
in 1985. But Gobie has gone far beyond that admission and said
Frank was aware he was running a prostitution ring out of Frank's
Capitol Hill apartment.
   Morningstar said that despite the ruckus, Frank has such ``a
repository of good will up here. ... He's one of the few people in
public life who the average voter has recognized does an
outstanding job.''
   Sachs says his strategy will involve distinguishing between
those facts that Frank has admitted and the statements by Gobie
that Frank flatly denies.

   Iran said Sunday it will mark the 10th
anniversary of the storming of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran by
letting its citizens tour the captured compound and look at
Iranians who allegedly spied for the CIA.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency urged Iranians to
take an active part in the celebrations on Saturday, the
anniversary of the embassy's seizure and the beginning of a
traumatic hostage crisis.
   Tehran Radio said Nov. 4, the date in 1979 when militants
stormed the embassy, has been officially named ``Day of the
Struggle Against Global Arrogance,'' an Iranian euphemism for the
United States.
   Both news agencies were monitored in Nicosia.
   The date of the embassy's seizure also marks another key
anniversary. Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, was sent into exile in Turkey on Nov. 4, 1963, by the
late Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi for his campaign against the
monarchy.
   The Iranian militants who took over the sprawling embassy
compound in central Tehran held 53 American diplomats and embassy
personnel hostage 444 days. Washington severed relations with
Iran's revolutionary government.
   The Union of Islamic Associations of University Students called
on students to march on the embassy Saturday and ``renew
allegiance'' to Khomeini in what appeared to be designed as an
anti-U.S. protest.
   Until Sunday, the government of President Hashemi Rafsanjani,
leader of Tehran's so-called pragmatists, had apparently been
seeking to keep commemoration of the embassy takeover low-key.
   Rafsanjani has sought to improve Iran's relations with the West
to end its political isolation.
   Although no early improvement in links with the United States
was expected, his moves have been opposed by anti-Western radicals.
   They have demanded massive demonstrations Saturday in an
apparent effort to undermine Rafsanjani's efforts.
   Radical parliament member Ahmad Rahbari last week declared that
Khomeini, who died June 3, called the embassy takeover ``the second
revolution,'' and said ``the officials and people should
demonstrate the greatness of this day to the people of the world.''
   Tehran Radio said authorities will open the gates of the former
U.S. compound, now used as a school for the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, on Saturday for the first time to the public and
foreign journalists.
   It said some of the alleged spies will be introduced at a
televised news conference inside the former embassy.
   The radio added that the confessions of the alleged spies
arrested in April will be displayed at an exhibition in the embassy
compound.
   Films showing direct cooperation between the Central
Intelligence Agency and SAVAK, the shah's notorious secret police,
will also be screened, the radio reported.
   Some of the alleged spies made public confessions on state-run
television several months ago.
   They claimed they had been recruited at U.S. embassies abroad
while applying for visas and asked to provide the CIA with
military, economic and political information.

<HEAD>Legislation Would Extend Labor Laws to Foreign-Flagged, U.S.-Owned
Ships</HEAD>

   American organized labor and seafarers' clergy
claim life at sea is anything but a carnival for workers on cruise
and cargo ships, and the groups want Congress to intervene.
   Mistreatment of sailors is older than the trireme and vaster
than the oceans, and the system of using Panamanian and other
``flags of convenience'' perpetuates unfair practices, they say.
   Paul K. Chapman, chairman of the New York-based Center for
Seafarers' Rights at the Seamen's Church Institute, says the same
conditions can be found today that were described 150 years ago in
Richard Henry Dana's ``Two Years Before the Mast.''
   ``In hundreds of cases that have come across my desk, there are
far too many similarities to the primitive past,'' Chapman wrote in
a yet-to-be published book, ``Trouble on Board,'' based on 10 years
of case histories from port chaplains.
   Chapters were submitted last week during a House subcommittee
hearing on legislation that would extend the coverage of U.S. labor
laws to American-owned ships flying under a foreign flag but
regularly doing business in American ports.
   Opponents say such a law would violate international law and
would drive cruise lines away from home ports in America to ports
in the Caribbean that are easily and cheaply accessible by air for
most customers. They add that U.S. companies would have to give up
their ownership and no new jobs would be created for U.S. seafarers.
   The opponents contend unions, charitable organizations and
seafarers themselves exaggerate the complaints.
   Chapman lists repeated instances of bribery, extortion, filthy
working conditions on rickety, rusting ships with jammed plumbing
and broken-down heating systems, and the blackballing or physical
harassment _ even jailing _ of seafarers who complain.
   Among the worst offenders of wage and hour law and workers'
rights, he said, are the budget cruise ship lines that have bought
up old passenger liners and converted them for one-, three- and
four-day Caribbean cruises.
   ``There is just no control of the number of hours a person
works,'' Chapman said in an interview. ``There's no kind of order,
no kind of redress.'' He says an 80- to 100-hour week is common,
and only a few categories supplement their earnings _ often
averaging far less than a dollar an hour _ with tips.
   Workers on cargo and cruise ships are driven from Asia, the
Caribbean and Central America by poverty, and supporters of the
shippers say conditions are better than those in the workers'
homelands.
   Cruise ships in particular are floating towers of Babel in which
as many as 40 nationalities may be represented, which Chapman says
helps owners divide and conquer the labor force and prevent them
from asserting their rights.
   ``Only when they make a claim for what they consider to be their
rights ... do they realize that while at sea they have in effect
sailed into a legal black hole,'' Chapman wrote, describing both
merchant and cruise ships.
   Labor contends the use of flags of convenience, which American
corporations began to take advantage of in the 1940s and 1950s, has
contributed to the decline of the American merchant fleet.
   ``This became such a lucrative dodge that today there are less
than 400 active oceangoing vessels under the U.S. flag, compared to
approximately 1,100 ships owned by American interests flying
foreign flags,'' said Talmage E. Simpkins, executive director of
the AFL-CIO Maritime Committee, in testimony last week before the a
subcommittee of the House Education and Labor Committee.
   He said that on June 1 this year, there were 24,000 seafarers in
this country for 10,000 billets, compared with 150,000 seafarers
for 61,000 billets 32 years earlier.
   Although this issue has been raised before, supporters this year
can raise the specter of Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   What if this country, in a national emergency, tried to
requisition U.S.-owned ships that operate under the flag of Panama,
which has the largest number of ships registered? Simpkins asked.
   The United States has signed International Labor Organization
Article 147 governing working conditions at sea, but the U.S. Coast
Guard ``enforces it'' by forwarding complaints to the flag port,
critics say.
   ``It's like writing a letter to Noriega,'' Chapman said. ``He
doesn't necessarily even read our mail.''
   Ship-owning interests say the law would violate the age-old
principle that ``the law of the ship's flag governs the internal
organization and discipline on shipboard.''
   Philip J. Loree, chairman of the Federation of American
Controlled Shipping, says organized labor's ``bargaining excesses''
are to blame for the decline in American shipping.
   ``The bill would simply speed up the transfer of control over
such ships to foreign interests whose vessels would then be immune
to the labor relations problems inherent in'' the bill, he said.
   He said ``shipboard living and working conditions have always
produced, and probably always will produce, complaints from various
parties _ some serious and many of the garden-house variety.''
   Said John H. Reurs, representing the International Committee of
Passenger Lines: ``Attempts by Congress to export American labor
and wage concepts to the foreign-flag ships are bound to be no more
successful than efforts to export concepts of American democracy to
certain foreign countries of the world.''

<HEAD>Rabin Tells Cabinet: No U.S. Technology Transfers To South Africa</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Cabinet
on Sunday that Israel did not give South Africa any military
technology developed or funded by the United States.
   The denial came a day after President Bush said transfers of
forbidden technology are ``taboo'' and that ``it would not enhance
relations'' if Israel defied the United States to help South Africa
develop a nuclear-capable intermediate-range missile.
   NBC News reported last week that Israel had provided Pretoria
with know-how from Israel's canceled Lavi jet plane program, which
was financed by the United States.
   Rabin was quoted by other Cabinet ministers as saying Israel did
not sell any U.S. technology or any technology developed with the
help of American funds. The Cabinet also issued a separate
statement of denial.
   Rabin, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and Foreign Minister Moshe
Arens met for an hour Sunday to discuss reports on Israeli-South
African military links and troubled relations with Washington,
Israel radio said.
   ``The defense establishment did not transfer from Israel to any
other country American technologies or systems that include
American components without permission by the U.S. authorities,''
the Cabinet statement said.
   ``All allegations in the NBC report that the Lavi technologies
or American Lavi technologies were transferred allegedly to South
Africa, are baseless,'' said the statement, read to reporters by
Cabinet Secretary Elyakim Rubinstein.
   Israel scrapped the Lavi project in the summer of 1987. Later
that year, South Africa reportedly launched a campaign to attract
hundreds of Israeli engineers who worked on the Lavi before losing
their jobs. Some Israeli-developed technology for the plane is
officially for sale.
   Shamir said the allegations were ``baseless lies'' and said the
Israeli public was united in its opposition to South Africa's
government, which is led by the white minority and denies the black
majority a voice in national affairs.
   ``We have been the subject of such recriminations many times,
and we explained many times to the American Congress and the
American administration that these all are baseless lies,'' he said
on Israel radio.
   Israeli officials viewed the reports that Israel helped South
Africa build a long-range missile in exchange for supplies of
uranium as an attempt to pressure Shamir into accepting U.S.
proposals for negotiations with Palestinians.
   Baker, following a plan by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has
proposed a framework for getting representatives of Israel and the
Palestinians to the table to discuss Israeli-offered elections in
the occupied territories.

<HEAD>U.S. Diplomats Will Try to See Captured Americans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. diplomats are hoping to visit
seven American members of a missionary medical team who were taken
captive by Mozambican soldiers, a U.S. Embassy spokeswoman said
Sunday.
   Cynthia Efird, the spokeswoman, said the Americans and two
captured colleagues had been flown to Maputo from a military
compound in northern Mozambique, where they were taken into custody
last week near the border with Malawi.
   Ms. Efird said Mozambican authorities promised to give U.S.
diplomats access to the captives after initial questioning was
conducted.
   The state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. said the medical
team apparently entered Mozambique illegally, but Ms. Efird said
she did not know if charges would be filed.
   Mozambique has been wracked by a guerrilla war since 1977.
Hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled into Malawi, and the
guerrillas of the Mozambique National Resistance have on occasion
set up bases there.
   The medical team was sent to the border area by the Christian
Emergency Relief Team, based in Carlsbad, Calif.
   Kris Courson, the relief group's director of medical services,
identified six American members of the team: Dr. Ken Daugherty, of
San Diego; Dr. Fred Leist and his wife, Lucille, of Bremerton,
Wash., Dr. John Cannon, a dentist from Davenport, Iowa, and
paramedics Carol Roberts of Syracuse, N.Y., and Steve Sherrill of
Stroudsburg, Penn.
   Ms. Efird said there was a seventh American in the group, but
she did not release a name.
   Also seized, according to the relief agency, was a South Africa
missionary, George Bezuidenhout, and a man named Peter Hammond. The
relief agency said Hammond was South African, but Ms. Efird said he
held a British passport.
   South Africa formerly aided the guerrillas in their war against
the leftist government but signed a treaty in 1984 pledging to halt
this aid. The U.S. government supports the Mozambican government,
although some right-wing groups in the United States oppose this
policy and depict the rebels as freedom fighters.
   Hundreds of thousands of Mozambicans have died and millions have
been displaced because of the fighting and resultant food
shortages. The rebels have been widely accused of commiting
massacres and attacking mostly non-military targets.

<HEAD>Democrats Taking Fresh Aim at Bush Over Minimum Wage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are renewing the minimum wage fight
to bolster their assault on the ``kinder, gentler'' image President
Bush is trying to project even as he insists on cutting taxes for
the wealthy and denying taxpayer financed abortions for poor women.
   Democratic leaders want to take advantage of a stalemate in the
Senate over Bush's insistence upon cutting taxes on profits from
the sale of stocks and businesses to win the first increase in the
$3.35-an-hour wage floor since 1981.
   With women accounting for nearly two-thirds of the nation's 4
million minimum wage earners, Democrats also believe the time to
strike is now _ on the heels of Bush's recent vetoes of two bills
that would have expanded tax-paid abortions.
   But they have given Bush until Tuesday to retract his ``first,
best and only offer'' vow last spring to veto any increase in the
minimum wage of more then 90 cents that is not coupled with a new,
six-month subminimum scale for newly hired workers. Bush has also
demanded that the wage floor not rise to $4.25 before January 1992.
   Democrats have scaled back their demands from the package that
Bush vetoed last June, knocking off a third-year increase to $4.55
once the new wage floor is established at $4.25 in 1991. But they
still want a training wage that covers only a first-time worker's
first 60 days of employment.
   Seeking to avoid another veto confrontation, both sides have
indicated a willingness to compromise further before a vote on the
House floor Wednesday.
   The minimum wage is being added to a pot of disputes between
Congress and the White House already boiling from disagreements
over federally funded abortions and Bush's insistence on cutting
capital gains taxes.
   On Tuesday, Senate Democrats will try to keep legislation
providing a three-year aid program for Poland and Hungary from a
GOP move to couple it with a capital gains tax cut.
   ``Obviously capital gains has nothing to do with aid to Poland
and Hungary,'' Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell said Sunday
on NBC-TV's ``Meet the Press.'' ``I hope very much that we'll be
able to proceed.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, interviewed on the same
program, accused Democrats of ``obstructing any effort to bring up
capital gains.''
   ``Just give us a vote, that's our strategy,'' Dole said. ``Let's
vote Tuesday.''
   The House has approved both the capital gains tax cut and an aid
package for Poland and Hungary totaling $840 million, nearly twice
what Bush asked.
   The Senate also may consider this week a House-passed bill to
raise the ceiling on the federal debt to $3.1 trillion. However,
it, too, is likely to get stalled in the fight over capital gains,
along with several other bills.
   The current $2.87 trillion ceiling expires at midnight Tuesday,
but the Treasury Department plans to borrow an emergency $17.6
billion Monday to keep the government in money another week and
cover November Social Security checks.
   Before turning to the minimum wage Wednesday, the House will
consider bills Tuesday appropriating $8.8 billion for the war on
drugs and banning smoking on all airline flights.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., originally had set a
deadline of last Thursday for the administration to come up with a
new minimum wage counteroffer.
   However, he extended the deadline until Tuesday after getting a
call from White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, who was being
told throughout the week by Republican lawmakers and conservative
Democrats who sustained Bush's veto last summer that they would not
walk that plank again.
   ``The issue has been greatly simplified, at least for a great
many of us,'' said Sen. Pete V. Domenici, R-N.M., referring to the
new Democratic package. ``It's time to change the minimum wage;
$4.25 over the next two years is agreeable to me.''
   ``I think it's resolvable,'' Domenici said, referring to a
willingness by Democrats and most Republicans to compromise
differences in the training wage proposals. He said he would tell
the White House over the weekend ``that we ought to get off the
dime.''
   Bush's aides are well aware that Republican lawmakers up for
re-election in a year are getting skittish about his intransigence
on the minimum wage while insisting on a cut in capital gains taxes
that would primarily benefit holders of wealth.
   ``I don't think the president would enjoy vetoing a second
minimum wage bill,'' House Republican Leader Bob Michel told
reporters after meeting with Sununu last week. ``The president will
have to bend a little bit.''
   Democratic leaders say they have picked up at least a dozen of
the 37 votes they would need to make up from last summer to muster
a two-thirds, veto-proof majority by Wednesday.
   Sununu has discussed possible compromises with many of those
defectors, but not with Democratic leaders.
   ``They know that things are moving away from them,'' said Rep.
Timothy J. Penny, D-Minn., one of 28 House Democrats who supported
Bush's earlier veto. ``Everybody wants this to be the last time we
have to vote on this bill.''

<HEAD>Tells Poles Not To Argue with Free Market, Take Advantage of It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GDANSK, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told about
1,500 supporters Sunday to stop complaining about the country's new
free market and it painful price increases and start rebuilding
through work and enterprise.
   ``Everything depends on you more than at any time in the last 45
years,'' said the leader of the independent trade union movement,
referring to the Solidarity-led government's steps to loosen the
government's grip on the economy.
   The government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has been
trying to quickly introduce a free enterprise system since it
assumed power in August from the Communist party.
   ``You wanted to live in Europe and you wanted to have what
Europe and the rest of the world have. We have started building it
now,'' said Walesa, answering questions from supporters as he often
does on Sunday after Mass at St. Brygida's Church in his home city
of Gdansk.
   But he said a lot of people still ``are waiting for someone else
to do it for us.''
   Walesa also touched on criticism coming from some quarters that
the country's wealth will be sold out to foreigners.
   ``If someone comes here, it will be in order to make a profit on
us, and this is why I would like you to open enterprises and banks
and earn as much as possible yourselves,'' he said. But he added
that foreign investment can provide technology Poles lack.
   ``There is a big harvest, but the harvesters are lacking,'' he
said. ``Who is supposed to do it? The Communists lost the elections
and stepped down. Poland will be like you make it yourselves, or
others will come and do it for you.''
   He noted growing ``disagreement among us,'' with Solidarity
being criticized for leaving behind its program of 1980 when it
fought for higher wages and lower prices.
   But Walesa told the crowd there was no going back. ``We are 10
years older'' and there are ``new facts,'' he said.
   As far as inflation, shooting upward since August at an annual
rate of about 600 percent, Walesa said: ``The raging prices are
normal things on the way to normalcy. They are very painful, but
you wanted the market to decide prices and not the minister and
that there would be no subsidies. This government is doing it.
   ``The effects can already by seen, but we have to go through
this period,'' he said.
   Walesa's remarks drew applause.

   One of the guests at Norman and Marilyn
Gotschall's bed-and-breakfast inn apparently has been around since
the turn of the century, and they don't argue with him.
   The inn served for decades as the Big Bay Lighthouse until the
Gotschalls bought and restored it 2{ years ago. They say William
Pryor, first of five keepers of the lighthouse on Lake Superior's
Big Bay Point, is still around and is responsible for running the
basement shower and other unexplained phenomena.
   ``He makes the walls creak and the wind howl at night,''
Gotshcall said. ``You can hear him wailing.''
   Pryor vanished in 1901, Gottshcall said. Hunters found his
remains 17 months later hanging from a tree about 1{ miles away, an
apparent suicide.
   Gotschall said the first sighting of Pryor was reported shortly
after the inn opened by two guests, who saw the spirit walking
around the lighthouse in his U.S. Life Saving Service uniform.
   Gotschall said his first close encounter of the supernatural
kind took place his first night in the lighthouse. He heard
something banging in the wind and went to see what was loose.
   ``But as soon as I got outside, the wind stopped and so did the
banging. It did this several times. I was up and down. But I never
found anything loose,'' he said.
   Gotschall claims the ghost makes one annual demand on his time.
   ``Every morning in spring he wakes me up, taps me lightly and
bids me to go fishing,'' he said. ``I know that fishing was
important to a lighthouse keeper. So I have to fish every morning.
I've always tried to comply.
   ``I don't want a mad ghost around.''

   Nightlife has suddenly appeared in this
tiny farming community _ you can tell because for the first time
there are cars parked on Main Street after dark.
   Voters decided to go ``wet'' and legalize the sale of alcoholic
beverages last spring, partly in hope of attracting business from
surrounding towns to keep the community alive. The opening of The
Pub in August ended 55 dry years.
   Still, Walter Brown, owner of the Pub, is keeping a low profile
since he is aware that New Windsor shut down its lone tavern in
1934 with a local ordinance banning liquor just months after the
repeal of Prohibition allowed it to open.
   When he opened, he simply put out a ``Bud Light'' sign and
placed a small advertisement in a weekly newspaper.
   ``I just want to have a clean, friendly place where singles and
couples can come for a quiet drink and some conversation,'' Brown
said.
   ``I'm going to put up an awning in a few weeks to try to dress
up the front of the place a little bit,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Municipal officials have entered a high-stakes
game, asking voters in a non-binding referendum if they want
legalized casino gambling and saying they ``don't have any option''
for their financially beleaguered city.
   If a majority of voters approve in Saturday's election, Mayor
Thomas V. Barnes will use the results to fortify the city's request
that the Indiana Legislature allow a new industry on the shore of
Lake Michigan.
   Thousands of jobs disappeared when the steel industry declined
in the early 1980s. The industry recovered when technological
advances made its products competitive again, but the lost jobs
never returned.
   ``We don't have any option,'' Barnes said Friday. ``We have
brought in some new businesses, but the erosion is far
out-distancing the improvements.''
   The state's second-largest city dropped to fourth as the
population dwindled from 190,000 to 135,000. Basic city services
became erratic, and the police and fire departments were cut from
400 members each to 200.
   Faced with unemployment twice the state average and meager tax
revenues, Barnes became the most visible leader of a pro-casino
movement. He is opposed by a coalition of influential church
leaders.
   Casino opponents say profitable gaming tables would lure
organized crime and bring increased street crime, prostitution and
drugs.
   ``We are going to win,'' said the Rev. William Booth, a Gary
minister who says casinos will drain the community's lifeblood, not
be a transfusion.
   When Atlantic City, N.J., brought in casino gambling in the late
1970s, it was also aimed at boosting the local economy, but results
have been mixed at best. Unemployment among city residents has
remained high as many of the jobs created by the casinos have gone
to outsiders.
   Gary's battle to win the Nov. 4 vote began almost as soon as
Gov. Evan Bayh signed legislation last spring approving the ballot.
The referendum had survived the General Assembly as a compromise
after legislators killed a measure to grant outright approval for
casinos in Gary.
   A legislative study committee in Indianapolis recommended Friday
that casinos be legalized if city residents endorse the idea.
   State Sen. Earline Rogers, a Gary resident and casino supporter,
said a strong if not overwhelming vote Saturday should be evidence
enough for legislators. ``I think 60 percent would be a very
persuasive argument for approval of casino gaming in Gary,'' she
said.
   The state's first foray into legalized gambling opened Oct. 13
with the Hoosier Lottery, less than a year after voters
overwhelmingly repealed the constitutional ban on gaming. People
pumped $33.7 million into the lottery during its first two weeks of
operation.
   A defeat of casinos won't turn out the lights in Gary, says
Barnes.
   ``We're not bankrupt,'' the mayor said. ``We're not even running
a deficit operation here. But the problems are critical and anyone
who sees these conditions each day ought to be desperate to change
them.''

   Congressional leaders on Sunday joined
President Bush's denunciation of Nicaraguan leader Daniel Ortega
and vowed to stand by a promise to provide humanitarian aid to the
Contra rebels through next February's elections.
   At the same time, despite the exchange of hostilities between
Bush and Ortega in Costa Rica, administration officials indicated
it was unlikely they would seek a renewal of military aid for the
U.S.-backed rebels at this time.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Ortega's
threat to call off a 19-month cease-fire between his Sandinista
forces and the Contras was ``a very unwise move, particularly the
timing of it.''
   Mitchell, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' called
Ortega's declaration _ later softened somewhat _ an outgrowth of a
rivalry between the Nicaraguan leader and Costa Rican President
Oscar Arias.
   ``It is my hope the free an open election process will go
forward and that the results will be accepted by the people of
Nicaragua,'' Mitchell said.
   He said ``we intend to honor'' the agreement the Democratic-led
Congress struck with the administration last spring to provide
humanitarian assistance through the Feb. 25 elections in Nicaragua.
   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, interviewed on the same
program, said he would present a resolution to the full Senate on
Tuesday condemning Ortega _ and he said he hoped for a unanimous
vote.
   ``There are 2 million people registered to vote'' in next
February's election, in which Ortega is a candidate, said Dole,
R-Kan. ``I Think Ortega sees that as a danger to his dictatorship.
If it's a fair election, he's gone _ which would be good news for
everyone.''
   Despite the headline-grabbing exchanges that marred Costa Rica's
two-day hemispheric celebration of peace and democracy, both sides
appeared to be trying to leave some room for flexibility.
   Ortega, who startled the conference by announcing he would
suspend the cease fire, later amended that to say he would make a
final decision on Tuesday.
   The Bush administration appeared to be in no mood to try to
persuade Congress to renew military aid to the Contras, despite the
flap.
   Such a move would be sure to generate strong new opposition in
Congress. The agreement reached last spring envisions a disbanding
of the Contras after the elections.
   A plan advanced in August by the presidents of five Central
American countries calls for the disbanding of the Contras by Dec.
8.
   On Saturday, Bush said, ``We'll let you know, we'll let you
know,'' when asked at news conference whether he would seek more
military aid to the Contras in light of Ortega's threat to end the
cease-fire.
   However, a senior administration official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said Bush was not trying to hint or signal
that he might seek to renew military aid.
   There is little sentiment in Congress for rearming the
anti-government guerillas, and winning the congressional committee
approval needed to continue non-lethal aid through February will be
difficult enough, another official said.
   The $49 million aid package agreed to between Congress and the
administration last spring is subject to review and a final
go-ahead in late November by congressional committees that oversee
Contra aid.
   ``I assume some of Ortega's apologists in Congress are going to
give us a hard time,'' Dole said Sunday.
   He also accused Ortega of ``trying to one-up'' Panamanian
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega. ``Dictators don't go away
easily,'' Dole said.
   On Saturday, Bush called Ortega's threat to end a ceasefire with
the U.S.-backed Contra rebels ``a shameful blow to democracy'' and
belittled the Nicaraguan president as a ``little man'' and an
``unwanted animal at the garden party.''
   Bush said a renewal of all-out fighting ``would be a very bad
thing for Ortega.''
   For his part, Ortega implied the United States had dishonored
the accord with its continued support of the rebels, whose
objective, he said was ``the destruction of the electoral process
in Nicaragua.''
   However, Ortega, who has often seized upon alleged U.S.
transgressions in an effort to rally domestic support of his
flagging government, stopped short of threatening to suspend the
elections.
   The Nicaraguan leader at one point suggested he would continue
to observe the cease fire if the United States decided ``to take
the money it gives to the counter-revolutionaries and gives it
instead to the United Nations so that it can be used to demobilize
the rebels inside and outside of Nicaragua.''
   In theory, current U.S. assistance to the Contras is limited to
that purpose already. Congress has long since cut off military aid.
   A cease-fire has never been formally agreed between the
Sandinistas and the Contras, though Ortega has informally extended
it on a monthly basis since March, 1988.
   Scattered fighting has continued all along, so whether Ortega
intends any real escalation of his military operations against the
dwindling Contra force, such as attacking rebel camps in Honduras,
remains to be seen.
   Under current U.S. policy, the Contras' remaining die-hards are
more hindrance than help for advancing U.S. goals in the region.
   The focus now is on support of Ortega's opposition, Violeta
Chamorro, in the February elections, as well as measures aimed at
ensuring the voting is honest.
   Toward that end, the United States is funneling $9 million
through the National Endowment for Democracy, a quasi-governmental
agency that promotes democratic elections around the world.
   An administration official said U.S. policy is for neither side
to violate the cease-fire. In fact, the official said, the United
States cut off assistance to a group of Contras operating in the
southern part of the country several months ago when U.S. officials
learned they were violating the cease fire.

   Federal investigators will convene a hearing
Tuesday to determine whether a manufacturing flaw in an engine disk
caused an explosion aboard a United Airlines flight over Iowa last
July, spokesmen said Sunday.
   ``The fact is that a pre-existing crack was present. How that
relates to what happened is why we are being as thorough as we are
in the investigation,'' said Alan Pollock, a spokesman for the
National Transportation Safety Board.
   Board officials are to open four days of hearings Tuesday in
Sioux City, Iowa, to make further determination of what caused the
tail engine of United Airlines Flight 232 to explode in flight,
Pollock said.
   The explosion cut the hydraulic power system in the DC-10,
sending the plane into a 42-minute spiral that ended in a crash in
Sioux City, killing 112 of the 296 people on board.
   The Washington Post, in its Sunday editions, quoted federal
officials as saying the manufacturing flaw caused the crash.
   ``The origin of the crack appears to be the thing that started
the whole sequence of events,'' the Post quoted Anthony J.
Broderick as saying. Broderick, acting executive director of the
Federal Aviation Administration for regulatory standards and
compliance, could not be reached Sunday for comment.
   The existence of the crack had been announced previously.
Spokesmen for the FAA and the NTSB said it was too early to
determine conclusively what caused the crash, and that it was up to
the NTSB. Under federal law, the NTSB investigates air crashes, and
the FAA monitors the safety of civil aviation.
   ``The FAA is party to the investigation, and has access to some
of the information. But they do not have access to the entire NTSB
investigation of the accident,'' said Pollock, the NTSB spokesman.

   Residents paused from the sober task of
rebuilding Sunday to celebrate a World Series championship as the
homeless cheered in Red Cross shelters and fans danced in streets
littered with earthquake rubble.
   ``This city needs a celebration,'' James Meade said after the
Oakland Athletics completed a four-game sweep of the cross-bay
rival San Francisco Giants with a 9-6 victory Saturday night. ``A
little happiness will help us bounce back.''
   ``People haven't been normal since the quake. They've been
antsy, on edge,'' said Pat Mackey. ``Now here's a good way to
relieve tension.''
   The triumphant A's marked their first world title since 1974
without champagne because their community suffered some of the
worst destruction in the Oct. 17 quake.
   ``I'm sure we'll have champagne sometime in the future. Right
now, it's not appropriate,'' said A's Vice President Sandy
Alderson. ``It's like a moment of silence.''
   The city planned a rally Monday morning in Jack London Square
with the ballplayers and coaches. No parade was planned after a
series marked by an 11-day earthquake interruption, the longest in
baseball history.
   Oakland is home to the quake's greatest single point of
destruction, the mile-long section of double-decked Interstate 880
that collapsed, killing 39 people.
   About 1,400 homes, 200 commercial buildings and 12 city-owned
structures _ including City Hall _ were damaged in the quake.
Damage was estimated at $1.3 billion, city officials said.
   ``We're now looking at the long, slow, insidious damage,'' said
city emergency planner Jim Worlund. ``It's not dramatic, but it
requires people to move out of their homes.''
   The quake struck hard at those least able to afford it. Eight of
the city's aging, low-rent residential hotels were condemned,
forcing about 800 people out into the streets.
   More than 400 homeless people sought refuge in Oakland's five
Red Cross shelters.
   ``We'll be dealing with these folks for many months to come,''
said American Red Cross spokesman Joe McGraw.
   For a few hours Saturday night, however, death and destruction
was forgotten as hundreds of fans thronged the streets. Many waved
brooms and chanted, ``Sweep! Sweep! Sweep!''
   A few blocks away, bricks from quake-damaged buildings remained
on sidewalks and streets. Less than two miles north, the twisted
remnants of the collapsed highway stood as a stark reminder of the
quake's power.
   In addition to releasing earthquake-induced anxiety, winning the
baseball crown was a proud moment for a city struggling to shed its
image as San Francisco's shabby neighbor. Oakland has been on the
rebound in recent years despite a thorny crime and drug problem.
   ``It makes you feel good after the earthquake to see the city
come back to life,'' said Ronnie Ami of nearby Fremont.
   During the weekend a steady stream of sightseers congregated at
the collapsed freeway, watching as backhoes chewed big chunks of
concrete into smaller chunks to be carted away.
   In places, the pancaked levels of the double-decked highway
rested on a makeshift framework of heavy wooden beams. Elsewhere,
crews had cleaned up some of the mess, and the elevated highway
ended abruptly, hanging in midair like an unfinished sentence.
   Three of the best-known survivors of the highway collapse _
dockworker Buck Helm, who was pulled from the wreckage by stunned
rescuers four days after the quake; Julio Berumen, 6, whose leg had
to be amputated to get him out; and his sister, Cathy, 8 _ remained
hospitalized Sunday. The children were listed in stable condition
while Helm remained in serious condition.
   Meanwhile, transportation officials said that the expected
reopening of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was pushed back
two weeks. A California Department of Transportation spokesman said
the original Nov. 16 target date had been a rough estimate.
   ``We're talking about the end of November at this point,'' said
Jim Larson. ``The original target was an early guess ... now we
have a little better handle on it.''
   The collapsed portion of the bridge was originally built with
fewer supports than the lower span that remained in place during
the earthquake, transportation officials said Sunday.
   A 50-foot portion of the upper deck fell like a trap door during
the earthquake, crashing into the lower level. One woman died when
she drove her car into the gap.
   The bridge normally carries 260,000 vehicles per day as the main
highway link between San Francisco and Oakland.
   The new upper section will contain 10 steel ``stringer''
girders, instead of the four girders of the original design of the
53-year-old bridge, Larson said. The lower section was originally
constructed with 10 girders; they will all be replaced.

   Israeli troops shot and wounded at least 15
Palestinians in clashes Sunday, Arab reports said, while
Palestinians staged a general strike throughout the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Elsewhere Sunday, the 30 residents of the West Bank Jewish
settlement of Beit Haggi near Hebron moved into permanent homes,
built with help from the Ministry of Housing, after living in
trailers for five years.
   Israel radio said the trailers would be used to house more
settlers.
   Washington has repeatedly criticized Israel's policy of
expanding Jewish settlements in occupied territory, saying it is an
obstacle to the U.S. formula of trading land for peace.
   One Beit Haggi settler, Nurit Hadad, told The Associated Press
by telephone that she believed settlements would grow despite the
Palestinian ``intefadeh,'' or uprising, against Israeli occupation.
   ``The intefadeh is part of our lives,'' she said. ``If we throw
up our hands now, we will have to throw up our hands for the rest
of our lives.''
   More than 70,000 Israelis live in 133 Jewish settlements among
the 1.7 million Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, which were
occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
   At least 606 Arabs have been killed by Israeli troops or
civilians during the uprising that began in December 1987. Forty
Israelis have died in the violence, and 137 other Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs for allegedly collaborating with Israel.
   Most of the shooting injuries Sunday occurred in the Gaza Strip,
but two teen-agers were also wounded in the West Bank cities of
Nablus and Tulkarem, Arab reports said. The army said it was
checking the reports.
   Sunday's general strike was called by both the PLO-backed
leadership of the uprising and the Islamic fundamantalist movement
Hamas.
   The PLO-backed leaders ordered the action to protest Israel's
plan for elections in the occupied territories. Hamas urged the
strike to mark the 33rd anniversary of the Israeli army's slaying
of 46 Palestinians in the village of Kfar Qassem.
   The mass slaying occurred when farmers, not realizing a curfew
had been declared, were gunned down by soldiers as they returned
home from the fields. The curfew was in effect because of the start
of the 1956 invasion of Egypt by Israeli, British and French troops.
   Also Sunday, Jerusalem police arrested a 12-year-old Palestinian
boy in the Arab neighborhood of Beit Safafa and accused him of
possessing three firebombs, two bottles of gasoline, 13 masks and
two outlawed Palestinian flags.
   ``The kid was guarding the stuff. Apparently there were more
youths, but they escaped,'' said Jerusalem police spokesman Uzi
Sandori. He said more arrests were expected in the case.
   The boy, whose name was not released, was ordered by a judge to
be held 48 hours for questioning, Sandori said.
   Beit Safafa, a village within Jerusalem that was once divided by
the Israeli-Jordanian border, has been the scene of stoning and
firebomb attacks on Israeli motorists.
   The Greek Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, Diodorus I, was
allowed to enter Beit Sahour on Sunday to say prayers for peace two
days after he and two other church leaders were blocked by the army
from entering the Christian Arab town.
   Beit Sahour, near Bethlehem, has been sealed off for more than a
month by the army because many of its 10,000 residents have refused
to pay Israeli taxes as part of the uprising.
   In Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp, soldiers arrested 12 suspected
members of an outlawed ``popular committee,'' an enforcing arm of
the Palestinian uprising's underground leadership, military
officials said.
   They said the arrests were made Saturday. They said the
activists belong to Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah branch of the
PLO.
   ``The operation was carried out at the heart of Jabalya refugee
camp where people are very much exposed to the influence of masked
activists. The group is large and organized, and the performance of
the forces was very good, without fire,'' an officier identified
only as Col. G. said on Israel Television.

   A church's congregation released more
than 1,000 helium balloons Sunday in a gesture of hope for the safe
return of an 11-year-old boy abducted on the outskirts of this
small town a week ago.
   An additional 100 National Guard soldiers joined in the hunt for
Jacob Wetterling, increasing the number of searchers to 305.
   ``There's a lot of power here. A lot of hope. I've got to feel
very hopeful,'' said Jacob's mother, Patty Wetterling.
   The release of the white balloons, each labeled with the words
``Jacob's Hope,'' was another attempt by this central Minnesota
town of 2,200 to sustain momentum in the search.
   ``I think they are sending out all our love all over the place
and I don't think there is a place that is going to be untouched by
this,'' Mrs. Wetterling said of the balloons, which were released
after a service at St. Joseph's Catholic Church.
   Jacob, a top student and hockey player, was returning from a
convenience store with his 10-year-old brother, Trevor, and an
11-year-old friend on the evening of Oct. 22 when a masked man
abducted him at gunpoint on a dark stretch of road just outside
town. The man asked the boys their ages, then grabbed Jacob and
threatened to shoot the others unless they ran away.
   It was the first time the children had been allowed to go to the
store after dark without an adult.
   At least $125,000 in rewards have been offered for Jacob's
return.
   To help focus attention on the search, Oakland Athletics catcher
Terry Steinbach, a native of New Ulm about 90 miles south of St.
Joseph, wore a ``J'' on the back of his batting helmet during the
fourth game of the World Series in San Francisco on Saturday night.
   Officials released a sketch of an artist's conception of a man
who tried to abduct another boy in the same area last summer,
prompting more than 1,500 telephoned tips Saturday.
   At the Wetterlings' request, Gov. Rudy Perpich authorized the
release of 100 more National Guard troops Sunday to join 125 Guard
troops and about 80 state Department of Natural Resources workers
searching the woods and fields around St. Joseph.
   The group was making a shoulder-to-shoulder search of the
36-square-mile township for any sigh of Jacob or his abductor, said
Guard Maj. Nate Thomas. The search was expected to resume Monday.
   A white sweat sock found Saturday near the kidnapping site will
be taken to the state crime lab for analysis Monday to determine if
it is linked to the abduction, Stearns County Sheriff's Department
officials said..
   ``There's been no additional finding of clues,'' Thomas said.
``They're going to continue to search as long as they can tonight.''
   Two helicopters were available for Sunday's search, but they
were grounded by wet weather.

   Army troops killed 27 guerrillas of the Maoist
Shining Path movement in a battle near the Andean hamlet of
Pariajasa southeast of Lima, officials reported Sunday.
   A sergeant and a corporal were wounded in the fighting Saturday,
according to a communique issued by the Political-Military Command
of the Emergency Zone in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima. It
gave no further details but the guerrilla death toll would be the
highest in recent weeks.
   Pariajasa is 53 miles north of Ayacucho.
   The Shining Path, which began its anti-government campaign nine
years ago in Ayacucho province, has intensified its attacks to
disrupt municipal elections set for Nov. 12.
   At least 120 mayors, candidates and local officials have been
killed by the rebels this year and many others have resigned
because of threats.
   Police blamed Shining Path guerrillas for these attacks Saturday:
   _ Rebels raided the town of Palca, 155 miles east of Lima, and
killed three mayoral candidates after a ``people's trial'' in the
town square. The guerrillas then went to the nearby town of Vilca
and shot to death two councilmen.
   _ Guerrillas wearing military uniforms entered San Cristobal de
Humanaga University in Ayacucho and used explosives to destroy
laboratories, the student dining room, the printing shop and a
garage where 19 vehicles burned. No casualties were reported.
   _ In Huacho, 80 miles northwest of Lima, a car bomb exploded in
the downtown area, wounding one passerby and shattering windows.
   _ The city council building in Chilca, 140 miles east of Lima,
was burned by fire bombs.
   The Shining Path insurgency has spread from Ayacucho and the
guerrillas now operate in much of the highlands and also in the
northeastern jungles, where officials say they are involved with
Colombian smugglers in cocaine trafficking.
   Government reports say more than 15,000 people have been killed
in violence related to the insurgency.

   Two gunmen on a motorcycle wounded two
journalists as they left a Bogota television studio Sunday, hours
after an alleged cocaine smuggler was extradited and flown to the
United States.
   Police said the gunmen shot Jorge Enrique Pulido, producer of
the news program ``Mundo Vision,'' and newswoman Ximena Godoy as
they got into a car after leaving the studio.
   Pulido, 45, was shot twice in the shoulder and once in the
throat, and Ms. Godoy, 22, was hit in the leg, a police spokesman
said. Both were in stable condition at a Bogota hospital.
   Police said they captured one suspect and that he was being
questioned.
   No group claimed responsibility, but it appeared to be another
attack on Colombian journalists by drug traffickers in reprisal for
the government's extradition policy.
   Jose Abello Silva, an alleged top smuggler of the Medellin
cocaine cartel, was turned over to U.S. narcotics agents before
dawn Sunday at a Bogota airport and flown to Tulsa, Okla.
   He was the fifth and most important drug trafficking suspect
extradited to the United States since the Colombian government
began a crackdown on traffickers 10 weeks ago.
   The U.S. indictment accuses Abello of involvement in a
conspiracy to ship more than 1,700 pounds of cocaine and 6,200
pounds of marijuana to the United States.
   Pulido and Ms. Godoy are the ninth and 10th news media employees
shot since the government began the crackdown a day after the
assassination of a leading presidential candidate. The other eight
journalists were fatally wounded.
   In the week after the crackdown began, a group calling itself
the Extraditables and representing drug traffickers vowed in a
letter sent to a radio network to attack the country's journalists
and public figures.
   Since then, the offices of two newspapers have been bombed.

   The Nikolais Dance Theater, started in 1948, and
the Murray Louis Dance Company, dating from 1953, still exist, and
now so does Nikolais and Louis Dance.
   The combined group, with dancers and dances from both, is having
its first season here, Oct. 17 through Nov. 5 at the Joyce Theater.
   On Sunday afternoon, ``Segue,'' the first dance choreographed by
Alwin Nikolais and Murray Louis together, had its premiere. It's
unusual, but new works done separately by Nikolais and Louis on the
same program were better.
   ``Ten Legs,'' choreographed by Louis, first seen in April in
Montreal, is fun. Five dancers wear leotards of colorful geometric
patterns over the torso with red legs. Dancers do new ways of
lifting each other. They form a circle, put the weight on their
shoulders and wave their legs in the air. They stack themselves up
like the Pilobolus Dance Company. It's all light and amusing.
   Nikolais' ``Intrados'' had its premiere last week at the Joyce.
Edward Akio Taketa and Christopher Strauss are each inside a metal
hoop, each hoop resting on a sturdy stand.
   They curve their spines to fit the hoop, plant their feet and
``walk'' all the way around the hoop, inside. They stretch out of
it, hang upside down from it, balance atop it, attain more
positions in and around it than one would think possible. Taketa
looks the happier of the two in his hoop. Both have amazing muscle
control. It's like watching a high-wire act.
   In ``Segue,'' subtitled ``Thru Memory's Eyes,'' a man scoots
onto the stage on a low cart. He has a book from which the dancers
presumably will come.
   A program insert shows that the order of scenes is much
different from the printed program. The two choreographers must
have been working on ``Segue'' almost to curtain time.
   In ``Time and Remembrance,'' dancers in leotards the color of
their skin dance in mechanical fashion. ``The Eccentric Aunt''
comes in looking like a round-faced Russian doll, swirling her
cape. She suddenly dons a white animal mask, scoots forward like an
old person or maybe an animal. It was interesting but hard to grasp
the meaning.
   Four women in big, round hats with wrap-around net veils which
covered their bodies danced with feminine, slow, gentle movements.
It looked like an avant-garde fashion show. ``Martial Arts'' was
danced by four men dressed like nutcrackers, moving mechanically.
   A clown, making much of his large hands, was followed by
``Ancestral Figures,'' four in ET-like masks who could have been
emerging from the early earth's mud. Finally, the first figure
returned, opened the book _ of history or fairy tales _ and the
dancers went to sleep.
   Lighting and electronic music for all three was done by Nikolais.
   Next year, both companies and the joint company will tour.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A wintry storm dumped nearly 2 feet of snow on parts of the
northern Rockies and ushered lighter amounts into the northern
Plains on Sunday, and thunderstorms preceding a cold front doused
the southern Plains.
   Indian summer persisted across much of the Northeast, where
skies were fair and highs were in the 70s. At least six cities set
or tied record highs for the date, including Portland, Maine, where
the high of 75 degrees broke a mark of 74 set in 1946.
   Overnight snowfall was heaviest in northern and western Wyoming.
By daybreak, 22 inches had fallen at Burgess Junction, 16 inches in
the foothills west of Cody, 15 inches at Story, 14 inches at
Sheridan and 11 inches at Dayton. Winds up to 30 mph produced
drifts up to 4 feet deep.
   Snow extended into the rest of Wyoming, the Nebraska Panhandle
and southeastern South Dakota Sunday. Rapid City, S.D., received 3
inches by midday, and a snow advisory was posted for western
portions of the state, including the Black Hills. Light rain fell
over the rest of South Dakota and Nebraska.
   A band of thunderstorms stretched from northwest Texas across
much of Oklahoma and Missouri, eastern Kansas, northwest Illinois,
eastern Iowa and southern Wisconsin.
   Showers and occasional thunderstorms also fell over the upper
Texas Gulf Coast and southeast Texas, and extended from east
central Florida to the North Carolina coast.
   In the mountains and valleys of Southern California, an advisory
warning for Santa Ana winds was in effect.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 24 degrees in Yellowstone
National Park, Wyo., to 89 degrees in Harlingen, Texas. The morning
low was 5 degrees in Yellowstone.

   Things were shaking but it wasn't the
ground at the Exotic Erotic Ball, a hedonistic Halloween tradition
that was one more step in this earthquake-rattled city's recovery.
   ``The scare's over with. People want to get back to a routine,''
said Dagny Lancy, 21, of Penngrove, whose floral costume of a stem
and two blossoms was literally painted on and contained the barest
stitches of clothing.
   If the city isn't getting back to normal, it's at least getting
back to being itself, which meant an outrageous bash for thousands
of revelers in all manner of dress and undress in a holiday
celebration similar to New Orleans' Mardi Gras.
   ``We're getting back to abnormal,'' said Wendy McMurry, 28, of
Belmont, a warehouse manager attired in lingerie and red fishnet
stockings. ``Oh, my God, is that guy naked?''
   He was. Larry came with his name and phone number written on his
stomach in Magic Marker. The only other thing he wore was his
camera.
   ``Everyone I know is kind of shaken up. But if you're looking
for a cathartic experience, this is it,'' said David Davor, 37. He
wore a black miniskirt, fishnet stockings, spiky heels and pearls.
   Tickets for the 10th annual dance Saturday night were $25, and
organizers donated 25 percent of the net proceeds to the disaster
relief fund. Artist Leroy Nieman was there to make a painting, and
he donated a portion of its sale to the quake fund. As in the past,
15 percent of proceeds went to AIDS foundations.
   ``People are ready for a release,'' said Louis Abolafia,
co-founder and producer of the event. ``If it all falls down, at
least it'll fall down with a party.''
   Halloween shops said business was good, but the demand for
fantasy stuff such as Scarlet O'Hara gowns was greater than that
for the Grim Reaper or other death-related themes.
   ``We've all been knocked out by this earthquake,'' said Pam
Minor of the Costume Bank. ``Halloween may not be as frivolous this
year, but a lot of people want to get dressed up and play for a
minute, to just go out and forget.''
   The Exotic Erotic Ball had few aftershocks from the Oct. 17
temblor. Two guys wore hard hats adorned with damaged suspension
bridges. But the majority of costumes were lace, leather, chains
and whips.
   ``I don't think anyone's thinking about the earthquake here,''
said Gidget Bates, 22, of San Francisco, selling candy bars from a
tray with a Mounds bar protruding from her costume's bustline.
   Bob Tally, 48, of Fremont, was a bit out of uniform as a
football referee. He had a striped shirt but lacked pants.
   ``The city has already proven itself. Let's rebuild and get back
to life,'' said Tally. He tossed a yellow penalty flag for illegal
forward passes and watched the show with glee. ``The earth moves in
different ways.''
   ``The earthquake's over. I'm more concerned with Halloween,''
said Edith Speed, a 25-year-old San Francisco artist.
   The most heavily covered part of Becky Roettgon, 26, was her
head, wrapped in a laurel wreath.
   ``I'm an elementary school teacher and this is the one time of
year I go out and do whatever I want and get away with it,'' she
said. ``A lot of people are ready to forget about the earthquake.
It's time to get on with things.''

<HEAD>Three Chinese Dissidents Flee to Taiwan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Chinese dissidents who claimed they
were involved in the pro-democracy movement on the mainland have
been smuggled into Taiwan with the help of a Taiwanese friend,
police reported Sunday.
   Police said the dissidents arrived in northern Taiwan aboard a
Taiwanese boat on Saturday night after escaping from the eastern
Chinese province of Fujian on Friday.
   The three claimed to have brought with them important documents
for leaders of a newly formed coalition of Chinese students and
dissidents in Paris, police said.
   The dissidents, who said they were seeking political asylum so
that they could go to France, were identified as Zhang Gang, Wang
Lung-meng, and Li Lin.
   Zhang said he was a vice director of a research center for
studying China's economic reforms and that Wang was his secretary,
police said. They said the occupation of Li was not known.
   According to police, the men were detained for questioning at a
holding center in central Taiwan.
   They were helped in their escape by Cheng Pai-chung, a Taiwan
concert agent, police said.
   Police said Cheng was detained for helping people enter this
Nationalist Chinese-held island illegally.
   It was the first report that Chinese dissidents have been
smuggled to Taiwan directly from China since Chinese troops marched
on Beijing June 3-4 and crushed the student-led pro-democracy
movement.
   Earlier this month, the Taiwan government allowed three
pro-democracy activists from China to live in Taiwan after they
arrived here secretly from undisclosed European countries.
   The Nationalist Chinese government, which fled to Taiwan in 1949
after losing a civil war to the Communists, is technically still at
war with China.

<TEXT>
   The centerpiece of Epcot Center's
newest pavilion is a special-effects ``thrill ride'' through the
human body, but another film about the conception of a human embryo
hints of controversy.
   Disney's 14-minute film depicting the conception and birth of a
baby could lead to complaints, especially in view of the simmering
debate over abortion, says the pavilion's show producer.
   Executives for Disney and pavilion sponsor Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co. view the film _ called ``The Making of Me'' _ as
forthright, educational and humorous. But they agree it is somewhat
of a departure for a Disney attraction.
   ``I think it will elicit some controversy, but our intent is not
to walk into the teeth of that (abortion) issue,'' said Barry
Braverman, who led the design team putting together the Wonders of
Life Pavilion at Epcot Center.
   Disney has no message to deliver other than ``the natural
biological process of life,'' said Braverman before Monday's
opening. ``We will just have to accept any controversy that goes
with it, if it happens.''
   The short film gives a witty narration of the basics of getting
a sperm and egg together to create human life and suggests that
life begins at conception. Its narrator-protagonist is Martin Short
of ``Saturday Night Live'' fame.
   The film was written and produced by Glenn Gordon Caron, creator
of the ``Moonlighting'' television series and director of the
feature film ``Clean and Sober.''
   It includes startling photographs of fetal development by
Swedish cinematographer-photographer Lennart Nilsson that have
appeared in ``Miracle of Life'' on the Public Broadcasting System's
Nova Series.
   Anti-abortion groups used Nilsson's film in arguments that a
fetus is a living person even in its earliest stages.
   Both Disney Chairman Michael Eisner and outgoing Metropolitan
Life President John C. Creedon were instrumental in getting the
birth film made, company officials said.
   ``Everybody cringed at first, but Michael and Creedon were both
adamant,'' said Pavilion Director Jim McCaskill of Metropolitan
Life.
   ``Michael was very strong in having this film,'' Braverman said,
explaining the Disney departure from light, non-controversial
subjects. ``Of all the elements in the pavilion, he was most
closely involved with this one. We went through a lot of scripts.''
   McCaskill said he didn't think there would be any complaints.
   ``Of course, anything you do, somebody's going to object to it.
But this thing is so well done and so general that anybody that
would object to it would object to anything.''
   ``The Making of Me'' is only one of the attractions celebrating
life and health in the bright, festive pavilion, the ninth in the
Future World section of Epcot.
   Its showcase is the high-speed simulator ride through the human
bloodstream to the lungs, heart and brain. It's called ``Body
Wars.''
   A motion picture effects group set up by ``Star Wars'' director
George Lucas created the ``Body Wars'' adventure along with Disney
creators. The 4{-minute film that goes with the jolting ride was
directed by Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr. Spock in the ``Star
Trek'' television series.
   ``Our goal was to show people what a wondrous realm the human
body is,'' said Braverman.
   Eleven-year-old visitor Justin DiCarlo of Putnam County, N.Y.,
called it ``awesome'' and ``turbuloso.''
   Much of the 100,000 square-foot pavilion is given over to a
collection of participatory exhibits.
   Company executives would not disclose financing of the center,
but Disney sources estimated Wonders of Life cost about $90 million.

   Nearly two weeks after an earthquake
shattered parts of Northern California, residents of the Marina
district on Sunday gingerly picked through the rubble of their
lives and scavenged for mementos and papers from their past.
   A warm, sunny weekend next to San Francisco Bay normally would
have brought out joggers and bicyclists, but instead scores of
people searched through remains of apartment buildings razed
because they were no longer safe. Some people carried belongings
from damaged structures scheduled for demolition.
   Dave Angelesco, 75, teetered atop a mountain of rubble that had
been his home for five decades. As he looked for important papers,
the retired coffee salesman lamented he would have to leave the
neighborhood he called ``close to heaven'' because rent at a new
spot in the district would be too high.
   Other Marina residents moved out of undamaged structures because
they will be without the natural gas used to heat their homes, take
hot showers and cook for months, as crews lay a new system of pipes.
   The city Department of Public Works reported Saturday that the
Marina District suffered more damage in the Oct. 17 earthquake than
any other part of San Francisco.
   ``For the most part, the only people who are living here now are
like us, the owners of a building. The tenants have moved out,''
Steven Grover, a landlord, said as he ate lunch with his wife next
to a Salvation Army food van.
   Seventy structures are considered unsafe to enter in the
affluent neighborhood of aging three- and four-story wood and
stucco apartment buildings, officials said.
   Displaced renters said they were finding refuge in the homes of
friends, relatives and even strangers. Some sought government
disaster assistance.
   Utility trucks were parked nearly bumper to bumper along some
streets as crews dug trenches for new natural gas lines. Workers
said they are laboring from 7 a.m. to midnight in hope of replacing
by Christmas the shattered system that once served 5,700 customers.
   Though water and electricity services have been restored, the
gas outage means residents who remain must use electric appliances
to cook, use extra clothes or electric heaters to stay warm, and
electric blankets or sleeping bags at night. Many use portable
public showers.
   ``We'll stick it out,'' said Alexandra Grover, who with her
husband, Steven, co-owns an apartment building. ``After the next
big quake aftershock though, we may re-think.''
   Residents have been asked by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. to limit
use of electric appliances and to skip installing new power-using
devices because it would strain wiring in aging structures and the
utility's supply system.
   The hardships have driven some away temporarily, some
permanently.
   ``I'm staying with relatives, but I'll be back,'' said Daniel
Flanagan, 80, whose apartment was undamaged. ``Right now, I've got
no hot water, no gas.''
   Psychologist Lori Rifkin is moving for good. ``There's only one
guy out of 16 people staying here,'' she said, as friends lugged
boxes to her car.
   Her decision was influenced not only by the hardships, but by
fear. Pointing to buckled concrete and building cracks, she said
flatly, ``I'm not staying here.''
   On the waterfront road in the neighborhood, metal barricades
continued to bar traffic from narrow streets. Uniformed guards
allowed only people with proof of residence or official business to
pass. Police cars cruised past frequently.
   Mayor Art Agnos has warned bus tour operators to stay out of the
area. ``People in this neighborhood have suffered tragedy. ... They
certainly should not be subjected to stares from curious onlookers
or have their activities impeded by unnecessary bus traffic,'' he
said.

   A pedestrian suspension bridge
crowded with young people who liked to make it swing back and forth
collapsed ``so quickly that no one had a chance to cry for help,''
a witness said.
   Thirty to 40 people _ twice as many as normal _ were standing on
the 77-year-old bridge Saturday afternoon when the cables snapped
and sent them tumbling into the Little Red River, witnesses said.
Three children and two adults were killed, all members of a church
group that had been meeting in a nearby town. Eighteen people were
injured.
   ``We used to swing the bridge ourselves when we were kids, but
we never swung it near as high as they were doing,'' said Jennifer
Johnson, who lives near the bridge and saw the collapse.
   Authorities began work Sunday trying to learn what caused the
collapse of the historic 550-foot, single-lane bridge, closed to
vehicular traffic since 1972.
   Some area residents laid flowers at the foot of the bridge to
commemorate the victims as crews used industrial cranes to remove
cables and timbers from the river and to dismantle the bridge's
twisted iron supports.
   Residents said it was common for pedestrians to swing the
bridge; no signs warning against it or giving a load limit were
posted.
   Bob Burkeen, owner of the Swinging Bridge Resort, a marina next
to the bridge, said there are usually no more than 10 to 15 people
on the span at one time. He said most of the crowd on the bridge
Saturday were young people.
   An engineer had inspected the structure before it was dedicated
as a national historic site in May 1986, and it had been inspected
on three occasions since, said Cleburne County Judge Harvey Adcock.
He said the inspections were conducted by county road employees,
not by professional engineers.
   ``If we would have had any inkling that it wasn't safe, we would
have had it shut down,'' Adcock said.
   Cleburne County Sheriff Jerry Holmes said state police had
joined in the county in the investigation.
   The water beneath the bridge varied from waist-deep at one end
to 10 to 12 feet at the other. Heber Springs police officer David
Smith, who assisted in the rescue effort, said the death toll could
have been higher if the hydroelectric plant upstream at the Greer's
Ferry Lake dam had been releasing water to generate electricity.
   ``The water would have been much higher and the current much
swifter. We were lucky,'' he said.
   The wood-decked bridge, supported by steel cables about 50 feet
above the river, was a popular tourist attraction and on the
National Register of Historic Places. It sat in a popular rural
recreational area near Greer's Ferry Lake, 65 miles north of Little
Rock.
   ``We've been coming here for many years,'' said John Watkins of
Marble, Okla., a member of a Full Holiness church group holding an
annual meeting in nearby Prim. ``The bridge was the main highlight
of our trip for the youth. It won't be anymore.''
   The five people killed were attending the annual church meeting,
which attracted about 300 people from several states.
   Ms. Johnson said that as the bridge was swinging, its upstream
side appeared to buckle. ``It just turned upside down and fell into
the river.''
   She said people at each end of the bridge ran in an attempt to
get off, but they ``were just running in the air.''
   ``One girl said it felt like a dream until she hit the water,''
said Cindy Watkins, who came from Oklahoma with her sister, Vicki,
for the church outing. ``Everybody was up there laughing and then
all of a sudden it screeches and pops.''
   ``It just happened so quickly that no one had a chance to cry
for help,'' said Daniel Rafferty, 19, of Seymour, Mo.
   ``I had just gotten here and they were rocking the bridge,''
Rafferty said. ``We thought it was kind of fun and it scared some
people. We didn't realize how many people were on the bridge and
that the capacity of the bridge was not enough.''
   When the bridge fell, ``There were screams of terror. ... Arms
were flailing. People were panicking. Everyone was trying to save
themselves,.'' said Rafferty.
   Wayne Milligan of the Cleburne County Sheriff's Office said
authorities were confident that no other victims would be found.
   ``We've got everyone accounted for now. We have all people that
were here,'' Milligan said. ``Today we're going to try to keep
people away from the site. It's just mainly cleanup.''
   An estimated 100 to 150 people took part in the rescue effort
after the collapse, said county jailer Travis Moss.
   The victims were identified as Gayla Carlton, 34, of Prim; Jason
Williams, 16, of Muldrow, Okla.; Dana Waltman, 11, of Vancleve,
Miss.; David Shane Warren, 13, of Mayfield, Ky.; Catrina Cotrell,
early 20s, of Stratford, Okla.

   A twin-engine plane crashed on a
downtown interstate highway in an apparent emergency landing
attempt early Sunday, killing the pilot and seriously injuring his
wife, authorities said.
   Witnesses said the Cessna 420B's right engine was on fire before
the crash, according to police Lt. Bert Jenkins.
   ``The plane apparently did clip a power pole or light pole along
the interstate and went down,'' Jenkins said.
   State police identified the pilot as Bob Hamilton, 53, of
Warsaw, Mo. His wife, Merlene, 58, was in serious but stable
condition at University Hospital, a hospital spokesman said.
   The plane crashed on Interstate 30 around 2 a.m., just after
taking off from North Little Rock Municipal Airport, state police
said. Hamilton was taking a load of Arkansas Gazette newspapers to
Springdale, about 200 miles northwest of Little Rock, officials
said.
   Traffic on the highway was rerouted for several hours as Federal
Aviation Administration officials began an investigation and crews
cleaned up debris.

   A 13-year-old girl collapsed and died at
a school dance shortly after complaining of a headache, officials
said.
   The state medical examiner's office was conducting an autopsy
Sunday on the body of seventh-grader Rachel Dibble, the office said
in a statement.
   There was no indication drugs or alcohol were involved, said
Armand Fusco, superintendent of schools in Branford, about five
miles east of New Haven.
   Rachel passed out around 10 p.m. Friday as she danced among
about 200 other children at Branford Intermediate School, Fusco
said. She was taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital, where attempts to
revive her failed.
   Joshua Dibble, 12, said he was the last person to talk to his
sister.
   ``She looked at me and said, `Josh,' then she tuned out and her
eyes closed,'' he said.
   Rachel had walked outside for air because of a headache, then
returned to the dance floor before collapsing, said her mother,
Vanessa Carlson Kaiser.
   ``Rachel loved to dance, she died dancing,'' she said. ``I hope
that's the way I go.''

   A Navy helicopter team plucked four Coast
Guardsmen from heavy seas off Santa Cruz Island Sunday after their
lifeboat ran aground in a rescue attempt.
   The Coast Guard had dispatched a 44-foot lifeboat to try to
rescue two people from a fishing boat that was dangerously close to
shore, but winds gusting to more than 50 mph whipped up 10-foot
waves that grounded the lifeboat and tossed the crew overboard,
Coast Guard Lt. Mark Hudson said.
   A Navy helicopter from Point Mugu Naval Air Station rescued the
four crew members, who were not injured, Hudson said.
   A Coast Guard cutter later reached the fishing vessel and towed
it out to sea and out of danger, he said.
   Earlier Sunday, a Coast Guard helicopter crew plucked five
people off a sailboat that ran aground near Anacapa Island, Guard
spokesman Timothy Rowe said. The five people were flown to St.
John's Hospital in Oxnard for treatment for exposure, he said.
   A Navy helicopter team rescued six people from a sailboat off
Santa Rosa Island, Rowe said. One woman was in good condition at
St. John's with a minor head injury, he said.
   The three islands lie between 15 and 30 miles off of Oxnard,
which is about 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles.

   A computer virus has destroyed information at the
University of Tokyo's seismological and ocean research institutes,
a university official and local reports said Sunday.
   An official of the university's Ocean Research Institute said
the virus was detected earlier this month in four or five of the
center's 100 computers, but was believed to have first infected the
computers in September.
   The virus was found only in personal computers being used by
researchers, and not major computer systems, the official said,
requesting anonymity. He said the damage was not serious.
   He declined to discuss further details, but a report by the
Japan Broadcasting Corp. said a virus also had been found in
computers at the university's Earthquake Research Institute.
   The report said the virus was the most sophisticated yet
detected in Japan, where the problem is not widespread. Tokyo
University is Japan's most prestigious university.
   Computer viruses, created by unknown programmers, are pieces of
software that make copies of themselves and spread from one machine
to another through infected floppy disks, office networks or
telephone access lines.
   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breeding
germ, eating away processing power and storage space or destroying
information. About 30 viruses are known to exist.

   Space shuttle Atlantis returned to
its launching base Sunday riding piggyback on a Boeing 747 jet that
ferried it from California, and a practice countdown for the next
shuttle mission began.
   The modified jetliner touched down here at 5:04 p.m. EST, and
workers began removing Atlantis from its perch atop the aircraft.
   The 747 left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Saturday, but
rain prevented it from landing here later that day and the orbiter
made an overnight stop at Columbus Air Force Base in Mississippi.
   Atlantis landed at Edwards on Oct. 23 following a five-day
mission during which the five-member crew sent the Galileo probe on
its six-year journey to the planet Jupiter.
   Initial inspection at Edwards showed the shuttle came through
the flight in very good condition. There were only about 25 tiny
nicks on the heat-shield tiles that usually sustain the most damage.
   Atlantis will be moved into a processing building to be readied
for a mid-February flight with a classified Defense Department
payload.
   In the next mission, the shuttle Discovery is scheduled to lift
off Nov. 20 with a Defense Department satellite.
   The practice countdown is to end Monday. The five astronauts
assigned to the flight are to climb aboard Discovery for the final
two hours.

   Parliament will discuss the date for
presidential elections when it meets Monday for the first time
since Hungary was formally declared a republic with democratic
ideals.
   At its last session, which ended Oct. 20, the legislature
adopted laws and constitutional amendments to create the framework
for the first free multiparty elections in more than 40 years.
   It also established the post of president to replace the 21-man
presidential council.
   Last Monday the speaker of Parliament, Matyas Szueros, became
acting head of state when constitutional amendments went into
effect until a president is elected. He also formally declared the
new republic in a symbolic rejection of four decades of Communist
dominance.
   Earlier this month the ruling Communist Party disbanded itself
and established a Socialist Party that says it is committed to
multiparty elections and democratic reforms.
   Hungary and Poland _ the first country in the Soviet bloc to
have a government led by non-Communists _ are at the forefront of
reform in Eastern Europe.
   According to an agreement between the Socialist Party and most
of the major opposition groups, the president is to be elected in
direct balloting before the end of the year. The tentative election
date is Nov. 26.
   But the opposition League of Free Democrats and League of Young
Democrats collected more than 200,000 signatures on petitions
calling for a referendum on whether the president should be elected
before the parliamentary elections, which are to be held next year.
   They said a short campaign with balloting in November would give
the Socialist Party candidate, Imre Pozsgay, an unfair advantage
because he already is widely known. They also said Pozsgay's
election could give his party too much power before the
parliamentary elections.
   A minimum of 100,000 signatures is needed to force a referendum
under a recently adopted law. Parliament at its last session
postponed discussion of the petition to allow the signatures to be
verified.
   Andras Kery, head of the state office for population
registration, said 114,470 signatures had been authenticated,
indicating the legislature should approve a referendum.
   The League of Free Democrats ended a congress Sunday and
proposed that the opposition parties cooperate in campaigning
against the Socialists.

   A passenger train crashed into two parked
locomotives Sunday in the western state of Nayarit, killing one
person and injuring about 100 people, officials said.
   Dr. Raul Parra at the Ixtlan Health Center said by telephone
that the train's driver was killed in the crash and that its
fireman was seriously injured.
   He estimated the number of people injured at 100 and said his
center had treated 56, most of whom had been released.
   Red Cross spokeswoman Lourdes Palomares said from the state
capital of Tepic that the organization had treated 15 people, and
the Social Security Hospital reported treating six.
   Parra said some people with minor injuries went on to
Guadalajara before seaking treatment.
   The train, El Sinaloense, was on its way from the Pacific beach
resort of Mazatlan to Guadalajara, 550 miles west of Mexico City,
when the collision occurred near the small town of Aguacatlan, 40
miles southeast of Tepic.
   News reports from Tepic said it may have been caused by faulty
rail switching. Authorities said they were investigating.

   Two earthquakes about 15 minutes apart
struck northern Algeria Sunday night, killing at least 19 people
and injuring about 100, the Interior Ministry reported.
   Most of the deaths were in the Tipasa region 40 miles west of
Algiers and in the town of Churchell on the Mediterranean coast 60
miles west of the capital, the ministry said in a statement issued
early Monday.
   It said Prime Minister Mouloud Hamrouche toured the hardest-hit
areas with his interior and health ministers.
   The French government announced in Paris that it was offering
emergency aid to Algeria, a former French colony.
   The National Center of Astronomy and Geophysics said the
earthquakes, at 8:15 p.m. and 8:27 p.m., were estimated at 6.0 on
the Richter scale. The first temblor lasted for 30 seconds and the
second for about 15 seconds.
   The center said the epicenters were about 35 miles south of
Algiers, a city of 2.4 million people.
   In Algiers many people fled into the streets in panic when the
temblors struck.
   Police said some buildings in the capital's crowded Bab-el-Oued
and Casbah districts were damaged but there were no reports of
casualties in the city.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6.0 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.
   This region has a history of earthquakes, including one on Oct.
31, 1988, which measured 5.4 on the Richter scale and left 60
people injured.
   El Asnam, about 100 miles west of Algiers, was devastated by an
earthquake on Oct. 10, 1980, and an estimated 2,500 were killed.
The same town was hard-hit on Sept. 9, 1954, by a quake that killed
1,400 people.

<HEAD>Peace Train Returns To Dublin After Bomb Scare</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A train carrying 60 Protestants and
Catholics who were protesting the repeated IRA bombing of the
Belfast-Dublin rail link arrived here 24 hours late Sunday night
because of a bomb scare.
   The riders were among 1,000 demonstrators who traveled
northbound on ``peace trains'' from Dublin to Belfast on Saturday.
Similar ``peace trains'' ran south from Belfast to Dublin.
   The peace mission was designed to bring attention to an Irish
Republican Army bombing and bomb hoax campaign that has halted the
north-south rail link more than 60 times this year. The campaign
has depressed business and is threatening the jobs of 500 railway
workers.
   A Dublin-bound peace train was delayed Saturday night on its
return journey when a male caller told the telephone exchange in
Dundalk, near the border with Northern Ireland, that a bomb had
been placed on the track. Irish police said they could not
investigate until daylight.
   The 60 riders chose to spend the night in a train carriage at
Portadown, 25 miles southwest of Belfast and 87 miles north of
Dublin, rather than return to the Irish capital by bus. They joined
a regular train from Belfast to complete the journey when Irish
police declared the track free of bombs Sunday afternoon.
   Some 50 supporters, including family and friends, cheered and
waved banners of welcome as the protesters stepped on to the
platform at Dublin's Connolly station.
   ``We are delighted to stand here having completed our journey by
rail _ despite the intimidation and disruption of IRA bomb
threats,'' said John de Courcy Ireland, chairman of the Dublin
protesters.
   ``The success of the peace train in uniting so many people on
both sides of the Irish border has shown what can be achieved by
setting aside our political, religious and cultural differences,''
he said.
   ``We repeat our demand to the IRA to stop the bombing so the
line can be kept open,'' he said.
   The IRA, which is outlawed on both sides of the Irish border, is
fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and unite the
mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic
Irish Republic.
   The IRA had promised to let Saturday's ``peace trains'' pass
peacefully. But in a statement reported Friday by Press
Association, Britain's domestic news agency, the IRA said it would
``resume occasional attacks when we see fit.''
   ``These attacks are not aimed at closing it down but to force
British soldiers into painstaking and dangerous operations,'' the
IRA statement said.

   At least 19 people were killed in
central and southern Sri Lanka in violence blamed on Sinhalese
radicals, a government statement said Sunday.
   Six radicals also were killed in a gun battle with soldiers and
in attacks blamed on vigilante groups.
   The deaths occurred during the previous 24 hours, the government
statement said.
   Sinhalese militants are trying to overthrow the government,
accusing it of offering too many concessions to the minority
Tamils, who are mostly Hindus and make up 18 percent of the
country's 16 million people.
   The government offered the concessions in an accord signed in
1987. The accord, however, failed after the most powerful of the
Tamil rebels groups, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelamn,
rejected it saying it did not meet their expectations for autonomy.
   More than 5,000 people, most of them government officials and
security personnel, have been killed since the Sinhalese uprising
began.
   Tamils, who contend they are denied jobs and education by the
Sinhalese majority, have waged a bloody insurgency for a separate
homeland in the northeast since 1983.
   The predominantly Buddhist Sinhalese comprise 75 percent of the
population and dominate the government and military. At least
11,000 people have been killed in the 6-year-old Tamil insurgency.

   A wind-whipped blaze roared through brush
and canyon country overlooking the Pacific Ocean Sunday, charring
4,000 acres, destroying one home and forcing more than 2,000
campers to flee in this celebrity enclave, officials said.
   Farther inland, near Simi Valley, firefighters contained a blaze
that burned about 375 acres in the Black Canyon-Box Canyon area,
Ventura County Fire Department spokeswoman Virginia Dillard said.
No structures were burned and there were no injuries, officials
said.
   About 175 firefighters left Box Canyon to help fight the Malibu
blaze. In all, 570 firefighters were battling the fire.
   With four air tankers and six helicopters bombing a two-mile
front of flames with retardant and water, crews had the fire about
50 percent contained in the evening, Fire Department spokeswoman
Beth Maden said. No more structures were threatened, she said.
   The fire started around 5 a.m., and moved quickly toward the
coast, forcing the California Highway Patrol to close Pacific Coast
Highway, officials said.
   The fire torched a million-dollar estate, said Sandy Wells,
another fire spokeswoman. It also consumed another home under
construction, two cabins and a maintenance shed.
   Residents of the home were evacuated safely and there were no
injuries, officials said. The fire hit northern Malibu, in a
sparsely-populated section and only a few evacuations were
warranted, officials said.
   ``We don't have access to the water up in those canyons. We are
fighting it mainly from the air,'' Ms. Wells said.
   By late Sunday afternoon the flames had blackened 4,000 acres,
officials said.
   Flames also destroyed two cabins at the Hess Kramer Jewish
Temple Camp, although a crew managed to save a half-dozen others,
Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Bill Hoffman said.
   ``There was an incredible wind at 70 miles an hour when we got
here,'' Hoffman said. ``The smoke was so bad the whole mountain
just disappeared on us.''
   About 2,200 people were evacuated from five area campgrounds,
including 100 children from Hess Kramer.
   A flare-up occurred near producer and entertainer Dick Clark's
Deer Canyon home, but a strike team managed to steer the flames
away, Garcia said.
   A pillar of brown smoke blew over the ocean north of Malibu and
could be seen for 30 miles to the south. Residents hosed down the
roofs of their homes just north of the county line, and charred
trees and smoldering brush lined the coastal highay.
   Flames ran up to rocky coastal outcroppings, and a shroud of
smoke cut highway visibility to 100 feet. In other areas, flames
burned down to the ocean's edge, where they were finally doused by
waves.
   ``It has burned to Pacific Coast Highway. It stopped there. It
had nowhere else to go. The next step is the sand,'' Wells said.

   Jim Bakker's brother assured followers at
the Jim and Tammy ministry on Sunday that the once-powerful
televangelist was doing well in prison and his work would continue.
   ``He sends his love to everyone,'' Norm Bakker told a
congregation of about 175 at the storefront church at a shopping
mall. ``He says not to be concerned about him, that his spirits are
up and that the Lord is looking out for him.''
   Tammy Faye Bakker was staying Sunday at a $37.50-a-night room at
the Colony House motel in Talladega, Ala., about 40 miles east of
Birmingham, where her husband is being held awaiting transfer to a
Minnesota prison.
   Hotel managers instructed employees to block calls to Mrs.
Bakker. However, desk clerk Debbie Bussey said Mrs. Bakker
registered under another name on Friday and visited her husband
Saturday at the Talladega Federal Correctional Institution.
   ``She said, `You can tell them I've been with him all day,'''
Mrs. Bussey said.
   Brian Ross, a prison spokesman, said he was not aware if Mrs.
Bakker had been to the prison and couldn't comment in any event.
``That's not public information,'' he said.
   Prison officials said Friday that Bakker was expected to be
transferred to the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minn.,
within 10 days.
   The 49-year-old PTL founder was sentenced Tuesday to 45 years in
prison for defrauding supporters and diverting $3.7 million of
ministry funds to support his lavish lifestyle.
   Norm Bakker visited with his brother last week and said he had
been given a blue jumpsuit _ ``his favorite color'' _ and was
enjoying prison meals. ``He even had pizza once,'' he said.
   Bakker's cellmate is ``a fine fellow ... who's trying to teach
Jim to make his bed military style,'' Norm Bakker told followers at
the ministry's church-studio.
   The Rev. Gene Kennett of Erie, Pa., who preached in place of the
Bakkers, said the ministry would continue to operate while Bakker
is in prison.
   ``We have not been evicted and our offices and prayer lines are
open,'' he said in response to reports that the mall's owner had
asked the ministry to pack up.
   But Kennett confirmed that the ministry was looking for a new
site and would hold its last service at the mall next Sunday.
   Kennett also said financial problems have forced the suspension
of the television gospel hour the ministry had been broadcasting
twice a week to a small number of stations.
   ``Tammy will return to television when our present indebtedness
is raised,'' he said. ``Your prayers, love and concern are very
much needed at this time.''

   Dressed in bell-bottoms and other 1970s
garb, more than a hundred residents Sunday relived for television
cameras the frantic flight caused by the 1979 nuclear accident at
Three Mile Island.
   ``We were sitting in class panicking and crying,'' recalled Lisa
Cunningham, 25, who was a high school freshman at the time of the
accident. ``Our parents came and we made bus arrangements to get
out.''
   Residents of this Susquehanna River town that sits astride the
nuclear plant staged a flight to the town's community center for
CBS-TV. Ten years ago, residents actually took refuge at the
Hersheypark Arena and stadium about eight miles to the northeast.
   The network plans to broadcast the re-enactment of the nation's
worst commercial nuclear accident on ``Saturday Night With Connie
Chung'' on Nov. 25.
   Residents could be paid up to $500 for a day's work, depending
on their roles, according to a manager at the site who declined to
be identified.
   Cunningham said she wanted to participate to ``tell our story.''
   A series of human and mechanical failures beginning at 4 a.m. on
March 28, 1979, cut off the flow of cooling water to the reactor,
which sits on an island in the Susquehanna.
   By 8 a.m., temperatures soared above 5,000 degrees and the top
half of the reactor's 150-ton radioactive core collapsed and
melted. Contaminated coolant water escaped into a nearby building,
releasing radioactive gases.
   Then-Gov. Dick Thornburgh advised women and young children
within five miles of the plant to evacuate. As many as 200,000
people within a 50-mile radius may have fled.
   The accident was contained but the questions it raised about the
safety of nuclear energy effectively killed plans to build more
plants in this country.
   ``Everyone's life was turned upside down,'' said Gabe Von
Dettre, one of the show's producers.
   He sat on the edge of a sink at the community center sipping
coffee and looked across the gymnasium filled with Red Cross cots
and tables covered with red-checked cloths.
   ``Nuclear energy _ you've got to live with it,'' he said. ``But
of course it's terribly, terribly dangerous. What we are trying to
show is that it's terribly dangerous but it's needed; to inform
people about things they don't know anything about.''
   The accident's possible health effects continue to be debated,
with the operator, General Public Utility Corp., contending that no
serious harm resulted.
   But Sara Smith said she lives in fear every day, even though
``we never admit it.''
   Mrs. Smith said she blames the deaths of her husband, son and
grandson on the accident. Her 8-year-old grandson was diagnosed as
having cancer in 1980, her husband in 1985 and her son in 1987.
   ``There was no history of cancer in either of our families,''
she said.

   Halloween revelers outwitted and outmanned
the authorities again this year with a maverick street party that
jammed this college town's streets with about 8,000 people and led
to 154 arrests.
   ``There's not much we can do,'' said one police officer, who
refused to give his name. ``It's kind of hard for us to arrest
8,000 people.''
   The crowd jammed two or three downtown blocks Saturday night for
the 13th annual installment of a costume and rock-music bash that
city officials have been trying to squelch for years.
   Police made 154 arrests for violations including disorderly
conduct, driving while intoxicated, underage consumption of liquor
and underage possession of alcohol, Chief Rick Mayer said.
   About five people remained in jail Sunday, police said.
   The celebration began in 1977 as a party thrown for a few
thousand students at Ohio University, and has ballooned over the
years, Mayor Sara Hendricker said. There is no official sponsor and
partygoers bring their own refreshments or buy them from street
vendors, police said.
   ``People began to invite friends, friends began to invite
friends, and friends of friends began to invite friends,'' she
said. The downtown area is too small to handle the huge crowds the
party attracts, she added.
   Officials have been trying for years to stop the party or cut it
down to size, particularly by dissuading out-of-town guests from
attending, Hendricker said.
   This year, the mayor placed advertisements in newspapers across
the state warning that anyone parking illegally near the bash could
have their cars ticketed or towed.
   Organizers got around that hurdle by offering free parking at
the local county fairgrounds and running a shuttle bus to downtown,
said Bruce Mitchell, editor and publisher of the Athens News.
   ``It's a wonderful, colorful, creative time,'' Mitchell said.

   An opposition rally turned into a
rock-throwing confrontation with Sandinista supporters Sunday and
several people were injured.
   It was the first time in the campaign for general elections set
for Feb. 25 that such violence occurred.
   ``It's the same as in 1984,'' said opposition leader Azucena
Ferrey, referring to the other elections held while the leftist
Sandinistas have been in power.
   About 1,500 people gathered at a grass-covered field on high
ground above this northern Nicaraguan town near the border with
Honduras to hear a speech by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
presidential candidate for the National Opposition Union.
   UNO, as the 14-party coalition is known in Spanish, is the main
challenger to Sandinista President Daniel Ortega.
   As the crowd completed its march onto the field and Mrs.
Chamorro was starting to speak, a group of four women and one man
on the fringe of the gathering began waving a red-and-black
kerchief symbolic of the Sandinista Front.
   The five began shouting in the faces of UNO supporters. One
opposition sympathizer pulled out a machete but was persuaded by
others to put it back in its sheath.
   The Sandinista supporters drew a group of about 20 UNO backers
away from the crowd and into a side street, where more Sandinista
backers apparently were waiting. After more shouting, some
Sandinistas started throwing rocks and the UNO supporters ran into
the crowd on the field.
   Both sides then threw rocks at each other for about 10 minutes.
   At least two election observers, one of them from the
Organization of American States, ran for cover when the rock
throwing started. The observers could be identified by tags they
wore.
   Agence France Press photographer Peter Northall was cut when
struck on the neck by a rock; several other people were hit by
rocks and limped away.
   Police arrived 15 minutes after the melee started. About six
officers stood on the side of the field and watched.
   The UNO speakers started to descend from the wooden platform and
on the other side of the field more rock throwing broke out.
   A woman carrying a 2-month-old boy was knocked to the ground in
the fighting. The baby was bruised and the woman, who said she was
his aunt, was scratched and scraped. Her arms and legs were
bleeding.
   UNO vehicles that had come from Managua, 220 miles south of
Jalapa, were pelted with rocks and eggs as they left the town.

   Leaders of Christian and Moslem factions in
Beirut both pledged to do what they can to win the freedom of
Western hostages, Rep. Mary Rose Oakar said Sunday after returning
from a trip to Lebanon.
   Christian leader Gen. Michel Aoun, whose forces control east
Beirut, and acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss in Moslem west Beirut,
met separately with Oakar, D-Ohio, and Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. on
Saturday.
   Oakar said she told both leaders that Friday was the fifth
birthday in captivity for America's longest-held hostage,
Associated Press chief Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson.
   ``I brought him up at both the meetings with the major leaders
and they pledged to help,'' she said.
   Hoss told the lawmakers the taking of 18 Western hostages ``was
a gross violation of human rights,'' Oakar said in an interview.
``He said on a daily basis they're trying to pave the way for their
return.''
   ``One thing that they both said was that they feel terrible ...
that people think hostage-taking is synonymous with the Lebanese
people. They regret that the world opinion is such that people
don't make a distinction,'' she said.
   Oakar said her talks with the leaders convinced her there could
be a way to win Aoun's support of an Arab peace plan to end
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war. Aoun has rejected the pact and
convened an emergency meeting of his Cabinet on Sunday amid hints
he may dissolve Parliament to torpedo an Arab peace plan.
   But Oakar said she believes a compromise could win Aoun's
support. ``It seems to me that in the finessing of compromise there
could be some kind of gesture (to Aoun). They could move the Syrian
troops largely out of the city and into the mountains, for
instance.''
   Aoun rejected the plan because it fails to set a deadline for
the pullout of 40,000 Syrian troops sent into the country in 1976.
   Oakar said the trip was intended to show the Lebanese people
they haven't been forgotten by the United States, which in
September pulled its ambassador and 29 other diplomats out of the
country.
   The private diplomatic mission was not approved by the State
Department, which blocked previous attempts by Oakar and Rahall to
go to Beirut.
   Oakar and Rahall visited Lebanon in 1982 at the height of the
fighting between Israeli, Syrian and Lebanese troops to condemn the
Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Oakar said she and Rahall are the only
two members of the House who are of Lebanese descent.

   Shooting broke out at a Halloween party Sunday,
leaving four people seriously wounded, including a pregnant
teen-ager who lost her baby, a police spokesman said.
   An argument broke out at 2 a.m. during the party in the borough
of the Bronx, said police Sgt. Ed Burns. The fight spilled out onto
the street, where the shots were fired, Burns said.
   Tanya Hastings, 16, who was three months pregnant, was shot in
the stomach and lost the baby, the spokesman said. She was in
serious condition at North Central Bronx Hospital.
   A 25-year-old man was in serious condition with a gunshot wound
to the chest, a 16-year-old boy was in stable condition with a
wound to the right side and a 17-year-old boy was in stable
condition with a hip wound, Burns said. All three were being
treated at Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center.
   Police recovered one .38-caliber pistol, one 9-mm shell casing
and four 9-mm shells at the scene. Police did not know whether more
than one weapon was involved in the shooting, Burns said.

   The Socialist Party claimed victory in
Sunday's general elections, saying it had retained its
parliamentary majority by one seat.
   With 100 percent of the vote counted, government spokesman
Miguel Gil said early Monday the Socialists had won 39.55 percent
of the vote for 176 seats in the 350-seat Cortes, the lower house
of Parliament.
   The results allotted the following percentage of votes and
number of Cortes seats for the other leading parties: the
conservative Popular Party, 25.83 percent, 106; the Catalan
Convergence and Union, 5 percent, 18; the United Left coalition, 9
percent, 17; the Democratic and Social Center, 8 percent, 14. The
remaining 25 seats were divided among eight smaller parties.
   Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez told supporters in Madrid the
``logical consequence of the outcome so far is that we will have to
continue to assume the responsibility of governing.''
   His wife, Carmen, was elected as a Socialist deputy from the
province of Cadiz, making her the first spouse of a European head
of government to sit in parliament along with a spouse. Gonzalez
was elected in Madrid.
   Javier Arzallus, head of the conservative Basque Nationalist
Party, said earlier his party would offer its votes to Gonzalez to
ensure his re-election as prime minister when Parliament meets Nov.
21.
   Despite their victory, the Socialists did suffer a setback. They
had won 184 seats in the lower house in 1986 elections, down from
their landslide of 202 seats in 1982.
   The Popular Party gained one seat and the United Left gained six.
   Initial projections had indicated the Socialists would
confortably win their third straight parliamentary majority, but
those were revised after the polls closed at 8 p.m. (2 p.m. EST).
   The private radio newsork SER said polls of voters who cast
ballots in the final two hours indicated an increase in votes for
centrist and rightist parties.
   Gil said about 70 percent of Spain's 29.5 million registered
voters cast ballots, with a heavy turnout in the final hours.
   Analysts attributed the drop in Socialist support to discontent
in the party's left wing with what is viewed as the pro-business
position of Gonzalez's government.
   Four parties and political coalitions ran candidates nationwide
to elect 350 members to the Cortes and 208 senators, while a half
dozen regional parties entered some races.
   In the 208-seat Senate, the Socialists won 109 seats, the
Popular Party 74, the Convergence and Union 10, the United Left 1
and the Democratic and Social Center 3. The remaining 11 seats went
to the smaller parties.
   No single issue dominated this year's campaign.
   Gonzalez defended his government's seven years in power as a
period of stability and economic progress. But opposition forces
blasted him for the country's 16 percent unemployment rate,
Europe's highest, and deteriorating public services.
   The Popular Party, under its new leader and prime ministerial
candidate Jose Maria Aznar, remained the leading opposition party.
   Aznar took over the party two months before Gonzalez called
early elections Sept. 1.
   The United Left coalition, which includes the Communist Party,
was expected to be the major recipient of votes from unions and
workers who claim the government has failed to distribute equitably
the new wealth created by a four-year economic boom.
   For the last three years, Spain has boasted a 4.5 percent annual
growth rate, Europe's highest.
   Gonzalez argued a Socialist majority is necessary to assure a
government strong enough to meet the challenges Spain faces as the
12-nation European Economic Communisty advances toward the 1993
integrated market.
   The single market will increase competition by eliminating
barriers among EEC nations on the movement of capital, labor, goods
and services.

<HEAD>Florida Horse Industry Aspires to Challenge Kentucky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN MURPHY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Florida horse industry sprinted from
the gate at the beginning of the decade and was running along like
a champion.
   Then the $7 billion-a-year enterprise stumbled on the
backstretch and is now heading for the end of the 1980s trailing
long-reigning Kentucky and with some newcomer states closing fast.
   Beyond the extravagant preparations in this Miami-area town for
the Nov. 4 Breeders' Cup races and its $10 million purse, Florida
horse breeders and others are pondering whether the state can ever
fulfill its goal of becoming the world's thoroughbred center.
   ``We have all the factors here to dominate everyone, even
Kentucky,'' said Richard Hancock, executive vice president of the
Florida Thoroughbred Breeders Association. ``But we have to pull
everyone together _ from the legislators to the track owners. It's
been such a crazy decade, we're just about settling down now.''
   What happened in Florida, and in other horse-breeding states, is
a familiar refrain for the 1980s: boom, then bust.
   The horse game had everything a high-roller could want in the
early 1980s: a convenient tax shelter and entry into the glamour of
the ``sport of kings.'' Demand for top horses nearly doubled
auction prices to $50,000 or more.
   ``No doubt, we were on a roll,'' said Hancock. ``But you know
what they say about all good things.''
   It came to an end in the mid-1980s with new federal tax laws and
the slump in the oil industry, a principal source of the cash
pumped into the horse industry.
   The abrupt exodus of investors caused horse prices to drop,
lowered the purses at many tracks and sent the sport into a
tailspin as the costs of maintaining and racing a thoroughbred
exceeded $20,000 a year.
   ``We're about now at a point where the prices of breeding a
horse can be justified by the purses earned,'' said Douglas Donn,
president of Gulfstream Park in Hallandale, host of the sixth
annual Breeders' Cup. ``We're entering a period of stabilization, I
believe.''
   But others fear the 35-year-old Florida horse industry may be
heading for further problems.
   Dave Goldman, a horse industry analyst for the Ocala Breeders
Sales Co., said investors now appear to be looking for instant
winners and losing interest in the longer and costly process of
breeding, which could lead to lower-quality horses in coming
generations.
   ``It's just like building a baseball team,'' said Stanley
Ersoff, a Miami attorney and horse breeder. ``You can have a great
farm system and bring up quality players each year, or you can go
out and buy talent.''
   No matter now the industry fares, the stakes are high.
   The state breeders' association reports nearly 29,000 people are
employed in the Florida horse industry and the state has more than
300,000 race horses valued at $630 million. In Florida, the horse
industry trails only tourism and citrus crops in revenue invested,
said Hancock.
   And the group boasts that 20 percent of all U.S. stakes races
are won by Florida-bred horses, although the state produces only
9.1 percent of the thoroughbred foals.
   Kentucky, however, is still a long way from losing its
reputation as the thoroughbred capital.
   Nearly a fifth of all the nation's thoroughbred horses are bred
in Kentucky, and the famous ``blue grass'' is still sought out by
top trainers.
   Meanwhile, other states are galloping ahead with incentive
programs to lure thoroughbred breeding and related businesses.
   Between 1976 and 1986, the number of New York-bred foals
increased 321 percent and the crop in Louisiana and Illinois jumped
more than 175 percent each, according to The Jockey Club, the
national register of thoroughbreds.
   ``Other states really protect and cultivate their horse industry
from the statehouse on down,'' said Harry Mangurian Jr., former
owner of the Boston Celtics basketball team and a top horse breeder
in the Ocala area. ``In Florida, by and large, we do not get the
attention needed. I wonder if the state recognizes how important
this industry is.''
   ``The money is still in Kentucky. The top five or so horses are
there,'' said Hank Steinbrenner, who runs an Ocala horse farm along
with his father, New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner III.
   With the Breeders' Cup drawing national attention to Florida, an
ongoing debate about off-track betting in the state has
intensified. Proponents say it would increase public interest in
racing and raise the purses at the state's five horse tracks.
   But lawmakers have been slow to push the issue. A strong
anti-gambling bloc fought hard against the state's 20-month-old
lottery. Also, the owners of the state's 18 dog tracks and 12 jai
alai frontons have lobbied heavily against OTB.

<HEAD>New NBA Franchise Hopes Losing Doesn't Extend to Financial Results</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Minnesota Timberwolves are certain to be
losers in their first NBA season, but that hasn't stopped team
owners Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner from forecasting champion
profits.
   Not only has their franchise already doubled in value from the
$36.5 million they paid for it, but the pair's entry into
professional basketball coincides with negotiations for a new
network television contract and a growing national appeal for the
National Basketball Association.
   Timberwolves ticket and souvenir sales have been heavy. The
team's downtown arena is expected to open in time for the 1990-91
season, which could add $3.4 million a year to the club's bottom
line.
   ``I think the franchise is going to be in the black the first
year,'' Ratner said. ``If it isn't, I'll be disappointed.''
   Profits from the team, arena and a health club inside the arena
will total $378 million over 40 years beginning in 1995, according
to projections filed at City Hall. The city relied on the forecast
when it agreed to acquire a downtown site for the arena through
condemnation proceedings _ a $15 million favor for the team.
   The Wolves in turn agreed to pay as taxes 9 percent of yearly
after-tax profits from the team, arena and arena health club for 40
years starting in the club's sixth year of operation.
   The arena's estimated tax payments and the city's share of the
profits are expected to cover the city's expenses in acquiring the
land and providing municipal services.
   More importantly for Minneapolis, the new arena is seen as
helping revive a blighted downtown section by encouraging other
real estate development and boosting foot traffic at nearby hotels,
shops and bars.
   A study commissioned by the Metropolitan Council estimated the
economic impact of the new franchise at $10 million a year in
spending by out-of-town visitors, Timberwolves fans, and players
who decide to relocate in the Twin Cities.
   Ratner and Wolfenson, business partners since 1952, have a
combined net worth estimated at more than $100 million. They rarely
sell their holdings and the NBA will be their only foray outside of
apartment buildings and fitness centers.
   ``I think this may be our best deal yet,'' Ratner said.
   Ratner and Wolfenson paid $32.5 million for the franchise two
years ago. Based on the $65 million just paid for the Denver
Nuggets, the club would be worth double that now.
   The soaring value is tied to television. CBS will pay $47
million to broadcast this season's games, but the network is
expected to part with up to $150 million a year to retain the
contract. Its exclusive negotiating period ends Oct. 31.
   At $150 million a year, the Timberwolves' share would be about
$5.5 million. Local radio and television deals will add to the
total.
   The dollars reflect the NBA's growing popularity. Attendance at
NBA games has jumped 41.5 percent over the past five years, from an
average of 10,620 per game in the 1983-84 season to 15,088 last
season.
   And with an abundance of marquee players on opposing teams, the
Timberwolves hope fans will put up with home team mediocrity and
fill the stands in the early years.
   At the club's home exhibition opener against the Los Angeles
Lakers, for example, the Wolves drew a pre-season NBA record of
35,156 fans. The team has sold 14,600 season tickets for the
18,000-seat arena that will open next season.
   Also brightening the financial picture for Wolfenson and Ratner
is the league's first-year salary cap of $6.5 million for expansion
teams.
   But other sports executives in Minnesota aren't excited about
having to share the sports entertainment dollars of the area's 2
million residents with the new team. With the Timberwolves, the
area is one of only six U.S. markets to simultaneously support
major league football, baseball, basketball and hockey.
   Lawrence Greenberg, an accountant who has been a consultant to
the Timberwolves, said Ratner and Wolfenson face considerable
long-term risk in their NBA venture.
   Since the Minneapolis Lakers moved to Los Angeles in 1960, two
other professional basketball teams have failed in Minnesota. If
the Timberwolves are lousy when the novelty of a local NBA team
wears off, Greenberg said, there could be nights when they muster
only 3,000 fans.
   Not only could the team lose money, but the arena could become a
huge liability if it doesn't attract enough concerts and other
events, Greenberg said.
   Wolfenson and Ratner have been stung already. They invested $15
million in Midwest Federal Savings and Loan at about the same time
they borrowed $49 million to build the arena. When the thrift was
declared insolvent late last year, the $15 million was lost and
Wolfenson and Ratner have been unsuccessful in a lawsuit to recover
it.

<TEXT>
   For the first time, stock in the
Milliken &amp; Co. has left family hands _ and now belongs to
competitors of the privately held $2.5 billion textile empire.
   Executives of Delta Woodside Industries of Greenville paid
$73,000 to buy less than one tenth of 1 percent interest in
Milliken from disgruntled members of the family. But they said they
hope future purchases can ultimately boost their share to 15
percent.
   ``We perceive Milliken as a unique investment opportunity and we
would like to significantly enlarge our holdings,'' said Bettis
Rainsford, executive vice president of Delta Woodside, a textile
company roughly one-fifth the size of Milliken.
   More immediately, the Delta Woodside executives will seek to get
Milliken financial information that until now has been kept
private, Rainsford said.
   ``We will exercise our stockholder rights,'' he said. ``We
intend to pursue acquiring information that is helpful in
evaluating our stock investment and the possibility of increasing
our stake.''
   Rainsford and Delta Woodside President Erwin Maddrey bought the
stock about a month ago, Rainsford said.
   The shares were sold by the seven children of Roger Milliken's
late sister, Joan Milliken Stroud. Together, the Strouds, who range
in age from 20 to 40 years old, own 15 percent of Milliken. Their
father, Dick Stroud, was fired by Milliken in the 1950s.
   The children recently filed two lawsuits against company
Chairman Roger Milliken, one seeking to obtain more financial
information about the company and the other to prevent him from
amending company by laws to tighten his control on the 50-plant
firm.
   Milliken, 73, was out of town and unavailable for comment,
according to his secretary.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Northwest Has Settled Most Flight 255 Lawsuits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines has reached tentative
settlements in nearly all of the lawsuits filed against it in the
wake of the Aug. 16, 1987, crash of Flight 255, a newspaper
reported Sunday.
   Opening arguments in the combined trial of negligence lawsuits
against Northwest and McDonnell Douglas Corp., manufacturer of the
MD-80 jet that crashed on takeoff from Detroit Metropolitan
Airport, still are scheduled to begin Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in Detroit.
   But The Arizona Republic in Phoenix, citing a statement issued
Saturday by U.S. District Judge Julian Cook Jr., said Northwest has
settled or reached tentative settlements in most of the 157 suits
originally filed against the airline.
   Northwest, based in Eagan, Minn., reached settlements prior to
Saturday with families of more than 50 crash victims, the newspaper
said. Cook's statement did not disclose details of approximately
100 other suits in which settlements also were reached.
   Cook said the few remaining claims against Northwest either have
been deferred or removed from the upcoming trial, The Republic
said. The trial instead will focus on lawsuits against McDonnell
Douglas and on cross-claims and complaints between Northwest and
McDonnell Douglas, the newspaper said.
   Flight 255 was bound for Phoenix when it crashed 14 seconds
after takeoff from Metropolitan Airport, killing 154 of 155 people
aboard the plane and two on the ground.
   Mary Rowland, a law clerk in Cook's office, said Sunday that she
did not know about the judge's statement cited by The Republic.
Cook did not immediately return telephone messages left by The
Associated Press.
   Parties to the case said Sunday they could not comment on the
report because of a gag order Cook issued several weeks ago.
   The National Transportation Safety Board ruled in June 1988 that
Flight 255's pilots failed to properly set the plane's wing flaps
and slats for takeoff and failed to make mandatory pre-flight
checks that would have detected the error.
   Also contributing to the crash was the failure of a cockpit
warning system to alert the pilots that the flaps and slats were
not set for takeoff, the NTSB said.
   The person aboard Flight 255 to survive was Cecelia Cichan, then
4, of Tempe, Ariz. She now lives with relatives in a suburb of
Birmingham, Ala.

<HEAD>Davis Reportedly Talking With UAL Unions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   California billionaire Marvin Davis is wooing
United Airlines' labor unions as he considers another takeover bid
for UAL Corp., United's parent company, according to a newspaper
report.
   Davis adviser David Batchelder has discussed an offer with
representatives of United's pilots, machinists and flight
attendants, the Los Angeles Times reported Saturday.
   If employees are receptive to a new offer, Davis is expected to
have a proposal ready by late this week, the Times reported.
   Batchelder declined to comment on the report.
   Davis unsuccessfully bid $240 a share for the Chicago-based
airline in August. Since then, UAL has been the object of takeover
fever.
   In the most recent offer, an employee-management group led by
UAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf unsuccessfully bid $300 per share, or
$6.75 billion. But that bid fell apart when the group failed to
obtain financing. Since then the price of UAL stock has dropped
sharply, closing at $171 Friday.
   Citing unidentified sources, the Times reported that Davis will
not bid again without the support of the unions. Opposition from
the Machinists' union helped influence banks not to finance the
employee-management bid.
   Davis has indicated he is willing to offer employees a small
ownership stake in UAL. But he faces difficulty with the
Machinists, who oppose a debt-financed takeover, saying such a
transaction would put UAL's financial health at risk.
   An agreement with the company bars Davis from bidding less than
$300 per share or attempting to remove members of UAL's board. But
the Los Angeles businessman is not expected to bid that high
because of the drop in UAL's share price.
