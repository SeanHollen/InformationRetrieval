   Jeff Duncan, who founded dance companies in
Baltimore and New York, has died of acquired immune deficiency
syndrome. He was 59.
   Duncan died with friends at his side on Friday at Don Miller
House, a Baltimore home that provides care for people with AIDS,
said Ann Thomas Hartzell, Duncan's friend.
   In the mid-1960s, Duncan founded the Dance Theater Workshop, now
based at New York's Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, and
directed it for more than 10 years before moving to Baltimore in
the late 1970s.
   At the University of Maryland, Duncan formed the resident
Impetus Dance Company. He also performed and choreographed works
for the Baltimore Theater Project.
   Born in Longview, Texas, Duncan studied with such dancers as
Robert Joffrey, Doris Humphrey, Betty Jones, Jose Limon, Anna
Sokolow and Alwin Nickolais. He performed with the Juilliard Dance
Ensemble as Ms. Humphrey's assistant, appeared in Broadway shows
and joined the New Dance Group with Ms. Sokolow in the mid-1950s
before starting on his own.
   Duncan is survived by his mother, Helen Duncan of Longview, and
a sister, Alice Duncan Ross of Arlington, Texas.

   Gunmen with pistols and sawed-off
shotguns attacked four auto mechanics suspected of involvement in a
Mafia-linked stolen car ring, killing three, the Italian news
agency ANSA reported.
   The fourth man was serious wounded in the Sunday's attack, ANSA
said.
   The report quoted police as saying the victims were suspected of
roles in a stolen car ring in which BMWs and Mercedes were stolen
in northern Italy and West Germany and taken to Sicily, where they
were refitted, given new registrations and sold.
   ANSA said the men, all Italians, traveled back and forth between
Sicily and the northern Italian region of Lombardy and Cologne,
West Germany.
   The victims were just about to emerge from a house in the
countryside in the province of Agrigento before dawn when four or
five killers struck and then fled in two cars, the agency said.

   Suzie Azar became the first woman mayor in El
Paso history Saturday with a landslide victory over fellow city
council member Ed Elsey in a runoff election.
   ``I'm thrilled to death. I'm ready to go to work,'' Mrs. Azar
said. ``One hundred seventeen years is a long time for El Paso to
wait, and I'm glad they waited for me.''
   The final, but unofficial totals showed that Mrs. Azar captured
65 percent of the votes, or 29,961, to only 35 percent, or 16,218,
for Elsey.
   ``When you get a margin like 65 percent, that's a mandate from
the people that they're willing to work with you,'' Mrs. Azar said.
   The successor to Mayor Jonathan Rogers, who by law had to step
down after four consecutive two-year terms, will face problems
posed by widespread poverty and rapid growth. Unlike most Texas
cities, El Paso has a strong-mayor form of government with no city
manager.

<TEXT>
   The new mayor is expected to grapple with a high car-theft and
house burglary rate, a growing youth gang problem, shockingly high
rates of hepatitis and tuberculosis in outlying areas, double-digit
unemployment and a steady influx of Mexicans, many of whom work
illegally for low wages.
   Nonetheless, the runoff was almost devoid of issues until two
weeks ago, when Elsey brought up the matter of Mrs. Azar's finances.
   Mrs. Azar's husband, Dick, leases business property from the
city-owned airport, and Elsey said he wanted to know how much the
Azars made from businesses on the property.
   At Elsey's prodding, Mrs. Azar released a statement showing that
she and her husband had a net worth of about $3.7 million. Elsey,
owner of a medical supply business, has a net worth of about a
tenth as much.
   The two city council members defeated four other candidates in
the May 6 general election to make it to Saturday's showdown.
Before the May 6 election, the six-candidate campaign focused on
taxes, police protection and economic development. But Elsey and
Mrs. Azar held similar views, and Elsey chose to stress personal
wealth as a campaign issue.
   El Paso's elections are non-partisan and there are no party
primaries. Elsey is a Republican and Mrs. Azar is a Democrat.

   The cause of death was not released. Irvin Salky, Newborn's

because he did not want to be hospitalized.
   ``In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of students formed a huge
procession Sunday and left Tiananmen Square to march through
central Beijing to press their demands for democratic reforms.
   March leaders said students from up to 300 schools and
institutes would join the march at various points around the
capital.
   One student from Beijing Normal University said the goal of the
march is ``to have Chinese from throughout the world unite'' in
demanding that the government grant greater political freedom.
   Many carried signs demanding the resignations of Premier Li
Peng, who declared martial law in Beijing on May 20, and senior
leader Deng Xiaoping.
   Authorities did not try to stop the marchers as they set out.
   Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to a million people
to sprawling Tiananmen square, including thousands of workers,
there appeared to be few people who were not students in Sunday's
procession.
   Student leaders said workers would probably stay away.
   ``Factories are now taking economic measures against workers who
participate,'' one student leader said. Some, he said, have had
their pay docked.
   However, thousands of people lined the streets and crowded onto
overpasses to cheer on the marchers.
   ``Don't stop,'' some in the crowd yelled. ``We won't let you
down,'' students shouted back.
   
   
   On Saturday, student leaders proposed that demonstrators hold a
climactic rally Tuesday to ``celebrate our great victory'' and then
end their historic two-week occupation of Tiananmen Square.
   The call came as hardliners expanded their purge of moderates,
whose sympathy for the students triggered the fiercest power
struggle since the leftist ideological purges of the Cultural
Revolution.
   Student leaders said it was time to change tactics in their push
for greater freedom and an end to official corruption. But they
said protesters in Tiananmen Square, whose numbers had fallen
sharply to about 10,000, would have the final say on ending the
sit-in.
   Top student leaders Wu'er Kaixi, Wang Dan and Chai Ling held a
news conference at the square and called for a city-wide march
Tuesday to culminate the protest movement that began April 15.
   Also Saturday, President Li Xiannian made the first public
acknowledgement that China was experiencing a power struggle,
accusing some Communist Party leaders of plotting to create
confusion in the country.
   Sources said officials in the media, the party and the army
suspected of participating in the protest movement were being told
to write ``reports'' detailing their activities. The reports could
be used against them, the sources said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The developments came two days after Communist Party leader Zhao
Ziyang was reportedly stripped of power and placed under house
arrest. Zhao's fall signaled a victory for the 84-year-old Deng and
other leaders who oppose political reform.
   Zhao's ouster must be confirmed by a meeting of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party, which is expected soon. Party
officials from provinces and cities were gathering in Beijing to
prepare for the meeting, sources said.
   Sources said Zhao has been accused of heading an anti-party
clique.
   One diplomat referred to the clique as a ``new Gang of Four,'' a
reference to ultra-leftist radicals who ruled China during the last
years of the Cultural Revolution of 1966-76. They were purged by
Deng when he took power in 1978.
   Included with Zhao are Politburo member Hu Qili, Vice Premier
Tian Jiyun and Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, Chinese sources said.
   Chinese and diplomatic sources said Qin used his influence to
keep troops in Beijing from enforcing martial law.
   Millions of people have taken to the streets in defiance of
martial law, and Beijing residents put up blockades to prevent
troops from entering the city.
   Students waiting Saturday at the Beijing railroad station to go
home said they would bring their message out to the countryside.
   ``We have to tell the people to arise, including peasants,
workers, intellectuals and others from every walk of life,'' said a
24-year-old student from Wuhan who asked not to be identified.
   Tens of thousands of students have occupied Tiananmen since May
13, when they began a hunger strike. But over the past week,
thousands have returned to their schools in Beijing and elsewhere
and the capital has returned to normal.
   ``We just feel the movement is ready to take a new form,'' said
one student. ``We are ready to print newspapers and conduct
speeches.''
   The student leaders called for April 27 to be made into a
holiday commemorating their movement. On that day, hundreds of
thousands marched in Beijing to protest a People's Daily editorial
denouncing the student movement.
   In the first public acknowledgement of a power struggle, former
President Li Xiannian accused ``certain people in the leadership of
the Communist Party'' of creating confusion in China, an apparent
reference to Zhao.
   ``These people have an organization, a plan and a plot,'' Li was
quoted as saying on television news. ``If they succeed, China will
be thrown into a deep disaster.''
   In another blow to Zhao's faction, state-run media said Wan Li,
chairman of the standing committee of the National People's
Congress, had thrown his support to conservatives. During a visit
to the United States last week, Wan made statements expressing
sympathy for the students.
   ``After I had time to study the situation,'' Wan was quoted as
saying in a letter, ``I realized that a small minority was behind a
plot to cause turmoil in society.''

   Nearly 300 people were kept from
their homes Saturday while investigators tried to find out why an
underground gasoline pipeline blew up in the same spot where a
train derailed two weeks earlier.
   Two people, and possibly a third, were killed in the explosion,
which enveloped a suburban neighborhood in a cauldron of gas-fed
flames Thursday morning.
   ``We are still searching, still investigating the area,'' said
police spokeswoman Bernita Joyner.
   An angry city official, meanwhile, said the owner of the
pipeline had proposed to move the rebuilt line closer to homes that
survived the rupture and explosion, rather than farther away as the
city has urged.
   ``This has to be one of the most callous examples of corporate
greed in the United States of America,'' City Attorney James Penman
said. ``After killing those people they are going to move the
pipeline closer to the survivors.''
   Penman said Calnev officials decided that the city's proposal to
move the 14-inch pressurized fuel line to the far side of the
railroad tracks, about a mile away from any homes, ``is going to
cost them too much money.''
   Charles P. Diamond, an attorney representing Calnev, said the
company wants to move the pressurized fuel pipeline only about 3
feet east of its existing route ``to obviate any safety concerns
whatsoever to the existing pipe.''
   Although the city's proposal for relocating the pipeline was
discussed, Diamond said, ``I told him that he lives in a hopelessly
unrealistic world, and that every major regulatory agency agrees
that the pipeline should remain where it is.''
   Calnev also planned to ask a federal judge to issue an order
prohibiting Penman and other city officials from interfering with
Calnev employees working in the area. Penman allegedly threatened
to order San Bernardino police to shoot Calnev employees if they
try to dig a new trench, Diamond said.
   William Pugh, an investigator from the federal National
Transportation Safety Board, declined to comment on the dispute at
a news conference Saturday evening.
   Ten homes were destroyed and five were damaged in the eight-hour
fire. Seventy homes were evacuated, and Ms. Joyner said it was
unclear when the 270 displaced people would be be allowed to return
home.
   The area was barricaded to keep out the curious and there was a
round-the-clock watch. ``At this point, there is no danger of fire
or explosion,'' Ms. Joyner said.
   The death toll from official sources has fluctuated, rising to
three, then reduced to two. On Saturday the city police spokeswoman
said there were three dead: a woman, another adult and a child. But
Deputy Coroner Jim Sedgwick said as far as he knew the San
Bernardino County coroner's office had received two bodies.
   The explosion occurred just days after experts assured city
officials and residents that Calnev's underground pipeline had
escaped damage from the May 12 train wreck.
   The Southern Pacific freight train flew off curving tracks atop
an embankment and smashed a row of homes on Duffy Street. Two
trainmen and two boys in a home were killed. The train fell atop
the ground where the pipe is buried.
   The cause of the blast remained under investigation, but Calnev
manager Ken Seal has said the pipe might have been damaged by the
wreck.
   After the blast, pieces of metal were found in the ground near
the pipe and were identified as pieces of a locomotive and a brake
assembly from one of the runaway train's cars, said Jim Kolstad,
acting chairman of the NTSB.
   What ignited the fuel also remained unknown. A train passed over
the tracks 10 minutes before the blast but no connection was
immediately drawn.
   The city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced
plans to file lawsuits against the pipeline company. The residents
also plan to sue the city and the rail line, Southern Pacific.
   The American Red Cross provided vouchers for food, clothing and
lodging to the evacuees.
   ``The residents are still in the motels and they will remain
there until they get with Southern Pacific and decide what they
will do,'' said Bonnie Parker, spokeswoman for the Red Cross.
   The pipeline carried gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank
farm in Colton, several miles from the blaze site, to southern
Nevada, supplying the Las Vegas Valley with 90 percent of its fuel.
   The flow of fuel through the pipeline was shut off when an
automatic alarm signaled a drop in pressure, said Jed Robinson,
Calnev general manager in San Bernardino. However, up to 12,000
gallons of gasoline burned.
   The explosion was expected to cause a five-cent increase in Las
Vegas gasoline prices over the Memorial Day weekend, suppliers
reported. The price hike was prompted by the cost of having to ship
gasoline and diesel fuel by tanker truck rather than the pipeline.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T and unions representing about 160,000
workers were near agreement on new contracts early Sunday,
resolving disputes over medical benefits and wages in a frenetic
day of bargaining Saturday and working through the night on a few
remaining details.
   Disputes over certain job-classification titles and exact
contract language covering some areas of agreement blocked a
settlement. But, believing an agreement was at hand, the two unions
agreed to bargain overnight and terms of contracts due to expire
just before midnight Saturday were extended until further notice.
   ``It's a speck we expect to work out,'' a company official said
of the final dispute. ``We think we'll have it done by daybreak
(Sunday),'' a union official said.
   In the overall agreement being worked out by American Telephone
&amp; Telegraph and the unions was a wage and profit-sharing package
that should bring workers raises of more than 10 percent over three
years, a source said. It is the first time AT&amp;T has offered profit
sharing to its union workers.
   The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
unions had fought off AT&amp;T's demand that workers pay more up front
for health care costs, the issue that dominated the talks from
their outset in March.
   AT&amp;T won concessions allowing it to amend certain job titles and
thereby expand the duties of certain workers, the source said.
   Also included was a package of parental, family and elder-care
leave provisions. The family and elder-care provisions would allow
workers to take six months off to care for a sick parent, spouse or
child without losing seniority, the source said. AT&amp;T would
continue health insurance during the leave, the source said.
   And, in a proposal AT&amp;T offered on the final day in hopes of
brokering a settlement, the company agreed to create a fund to
support new and existing child care centers. The company-union fund
reportedly would total $5 million.
   If the remaining disputes are resolved, union and company
officials plan a joint news conference Sunday afternoon.
   An agreement would avert a possible holiday weekend strike by
AT&amp;T's union workers, although the unions had not been expected to
immediately call a strike even if there were not an agreement
Saturday.
   The new contracts would be subject to rank-and-file ratification
and would replace contracts with the Communications Workers of
America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers
that expired at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday.
   It appeared as late as Saturday afternoon that no agreement
would be reached by the deadline as sources on both sides reported
little movement on the health insurance fight.
   But by early evening there was renewed optimism, spawned by
progress made in a series of private meetings between AT&amp;T's top
negotiator and two ranking union officials.
   Those sessions led to progress at the formal bargaining
sessions, and as the existing contracts entered their final hours
both sides said an agreement before the deadline was possible.
   But both sides girded for a possible walkout nonetheless.
   AT&amp;T had several thousand managers on alert, their bags packed
in case they were dispatched around the country to replace strikers.
   The unions used computer networks with locals across the nation
to update members on the status of the talks and plans for
implementing a nationwide labor boycott of AT&amp;T long distance had
union leaders _ in the event no agreement was reached _ picked that
strategy instead of an immediate strike.
   A strike would have been the third against AT&amp;T in nine years.
IBEW workers did not honor CWA's 1986 strike, allowing AT&amp;T to keep
half its manufacturing plants open. The two unions negotiated
jointly for the first time this year.
   The talks, the largest single-employer collective bargaining
session this year, took on added significance because they will
affect negotiations later this year for nearly 500,000 union
workers at regional phone companies. Also, major corporations
seeking to curb soaring health care costs were eager to see whether
AT&amp;T could pass some of the bill to workers.
   The unions were determined to prevent the company from slicing
its $1 billion annual medical bill at the union workers' expense,
and from the start of the talks demanded expanded benefits while
promising to work with AT&amp;T on cost-control measures they said
would save millions of dollars.
   Job security was the third major issue behind health insurance
and wages, and AT&amp;T made a significant concession in that area on
Friday by offering to limit its use of temporary workers.
   That and other developments brought the first reports of
significant progress with little more than 24 hours remaining in
the existing contracts.
   Negotiators returned to the bargaining table at a Washington
hotel Saturday after just a few hours of sleep.
   Overshadowing their work were periodic private meetings among
CWA President Morton Bahr, Thomas Hickman, a top aide to IBEW
President John Barry, and AT&amp;T's top negotiator, Raymond Williams,
the company's vice president for labor relations. Those sessions
were the key to breaking the impasse over health insurance.
   AT&amp;T's initial wage package, presented formally on Monday,
included base wage increases and lump sum payments for both
operating and manufacturing employees and the company's first
profit-sharing plan for union workers.
   Included in that proposal was the company's demand that
employees be required to pay 20 percent of doctors and hospital
bills _ up to $1,000 a year in addition to deductibles _ and 25
percent of the premiums for dependent care. AT&amp;T employees do not
currently pay for dependent care and pay only annual deductibles
ranging from $150 to $300 for medical care. AT&amp;T said it needed the
increased worker contribution to cut an annual medical bill of $1
billion.
   According to company estimates, the negotiations affected about
21,500 long-distance operators, 35,500 in-house and field
technicians, 37,000 manufacturing employees and 54,000 other
personnel in clerical, administrative, sales and other positions.

   An estimated 20,000 people demonstrated in
Taiwan's two largest cities Sunday to support the student-led
democracy movement in China.
   About 10,000 students, movie stars and retired servicemen
marched in a park in downtown Taipei and carried banners
proclaiming ``Inseparable Blood Relationship'' and ``Long Live
Freedom and Democracy.''
   ``The students in Beijing are fighting for the future of all
Chinese,'' veteran actor Sun Yueh told the gathering in a speech.
``They have our full support.''
   Organizers said the rally was in response to a request from the
mainland students for international demonstrations Sunday to
support their fight for greater freedom and an end to official
corruption.
   In Kaohsiung, 230 miles south of Taipei, about 10,000 students
and faculty members from the National Sun Yat-sun University
marched, police said.
   Yu Kuang-chung, a literature professor, read a poem he composed,
``Tiananmen, We Are Coming,'' during the rally.
   Tiananmen is a massive square in Beijing where the Chinese
students have been camping during their 15-day protest.
   The Nationalist government, which lost a civil war to the
Communists in 1949, continues to claim it is the legitimate ruler
of all China. The Nationalists and Communists are technically still
at war.

   Two dozen right-wing demonstrators vaulted
barricades and briefly halted President Bush's motorcade Sunday as
he traveled to a Roman Catholic Mass in this seacoast city south of
Rome.
   Some protesters standing along the president's route tossed
handbills headlined ``Anzio 1945: Were They Liberators or
Invaders?'' at Bush's motorcade while others formed a human pyramid
in the road. The motorcade was stopped for about three minutes
until the protesters were removed by police.
   The demonstrators made no attempt to reach the president's
limousine, and Secret Service spokesman Bob Snow said Bush was
never in danger.
   ``The president was well back, he was never involved and never
in danger,'' Snow said. ``He was never threatened.''
   A few of the demonstrators, who said they belonged to a group
known as Destra Nazionale MSI, were arrested. Associated Press
photographer Ron Edmonds was injured slightly when a plainclothes
officer hit him in the face with Edmonds' camera.
   Destra Nazionale MSI stands for National Right Italian Social
Movement, a neo-fascist political party.
   Bush was on his way to attend Mass in St. Francis Roman Catholic
Church before he spoke at a cemetery for nearly 8,000 Americans
slain in World War II. The cemetery is situated near the site of a
British-American amphibious landing in 1944.
   The demonstrators' handbills, objecting to the ceremony, said
``the American President Bush decided to give an emphasis and a
propagandistic depiction that has nothing to do with an obligatory
remembrance of the soldiers fallen in combat.''
   The brochures said: ``Americans would like to continue to
present themselves as the only wall of defense of democratic
liberties.''

   President Bush paid tribute Sunday to
Americans slain in World War II and said their sacrifices
demonstrate that the West needs ``a strong military deterrent'' to
preserve freedom and democracy.
   On the eve of a NATO summit threatened by discord over nuclear
weapons policy, Bush appealed to the postwar generation of
Americans and Europeans to remain vigilant against military threats.
   He spoke at a Memorial Day weekend ceremony in a grassy cemetery
on Italy's west coast, where nearly 8,000 Americans are buried from
World War II, and then paid a surprise visit to the U.S. aircraft
carrier Guadalcanal which was anchored in nearby waters.
   ``We only had 10 minutes, we wanted to show the flag,'' Bush
told Capt. John McKay of Virginia Beach, Va., as he arrived aboard
the carrier by helicopter.
   The president returned to Rome and flew to Brussels, Belgium, at
midday for the two-day summit of Western allies which begins
Monday. Seeing him off were Italian Foreign Minister Giulio
Andreotti and outgoing U.S. ambassador Maxwell Rabb.
   Accompanied by his wife Barbara, the president flew here by
helicopter from Rome to lay a wreath and attend Mass at St. Francis
Church, which has only six pews seating about 70 people.
   On his way to the church, Bush's motorcade was halted briefly by
right-wing demonstrators who threw handbills and formed a human
pyramid in the road. The road was quickly cleared by police, and a
Secret Service spokesman said the president was never in danger.
   Bush, who arrived in Rome late Friday night, planned to travel
to Brussels later in the day for Monday's opening of the 16-nation
NATO summit.
   In remarks prepared for delivery at the cemetery, Bush said the
white crosses and Stars of David marking the graves here and around
the world were ``a silent tribute to America's battles for freedom
in this century.''
   ``As I reflect on this scene and anticipate the dynamic and
forward-looking Europe of the 1990s, I think of generations of
young people on both sides of the Atlantic who have grown up in
peace and prosperity.
   ``With no experience of the horror and destruction of war,''
Bush said, ``it may be difficult for them to understand why we need
to keep a strong military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve
freedom and democracy.
   ``The answer is here, among the quiet of the graves,'' the
president said.
   The remarks echoed the sentiment he voiced last Sunday in a
speech at Boston University when he said he was concerned about ``a
growing complacency'' throughout the West.
   ``As we gather today,'' Bush said, ``it is dawn in America,
Memorial Day weekend.
   ``And as the sun rises and the summer begins, the images both
here and at home are of countries that are prosperous and secure,
countries confident of their place in the world and aware of the
responsibility that comes with that place,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, in Brussels, NATO leaders already have started
gathering for Monday's summit.
   The atmosphere of the meeting has been marred by a dispute
largely between West Germany on one side and the United States and
Britain on the other.
   Amid a tide of disarmament sentiment, West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl has demanded that the West open negotiations soon with
the East to reduce short-range nuclear missiles in central Europe.
   Most of the weapons are based in Germany and, if used, would
fall on German soil.
   Kohl also is resisting plans to modernize the missiles to make
them faster and increase their range.
   The United States has opposed negotiations about the missiles,
arguing they are needed to offset the big advantage in conventional
forces by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   There also are fears in Washington that any negotiations to
reduce the number of missiles would create public pressure to
eliminate them entirely.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T and unions representing about 160,000
employees reached agreement early Sunday on new three-year national
contracts that include the company's first profit-sharing plan for
union workers.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. officials and the unions were
to release details of the settlement Sunday afternoon but sources
familiar with it said a compromise reached on the thorny issue of
health insurance would not require workers to pay more up front for
coverage.
   That demand, made by AT&amp;T, had threatened to block agreement.
Also in the contract, according to sources, are annual wage
increases for both operating and manufacturing employees.
   And the company included a package of ``family issues'' benefits
that include an improved policy for parental leave, a new one
allowing family leave to care for a sick family member and a new
joint AT&amp;T-union fund to support child care.
   The two sides reached agreement on the framework for a national
contract before midnight Saturday but still had a few remaining
disputes over local issues and contract language.
   The unions agreed to extend terms of existing contracts _ which
were to expire at 11:59 p.m. Saturday _ and bargaining continued
into the early morning hours.

   A tropical storm tore through Vietnam's

and leaving 100,000 homeless, according to radio reports Sunday.
   The storm razed 36,000 houses and sank or damaged 700 vessels in
the province on Wednesday and Thursday, the Voice of Vietnam radio
said in a broadcast monitored in Bangkok.
   Torrential rains in Nghe Tinh and Binh Tri Thien provinces north
of Quang Nam-Danang caused heavy damage on Friday and Saturday, the
radio said.
   Floods ruined 84,600 acres of rice and 49,400 acres of other
crops, the Vietnam News Agency said earlier.
   The storm dumped heavy rains on Laos and Thailand after leaving
Vietnam.

   Siamese twins who were joined at
the chest and abdomen and shared a liver were successfully
separated at the Government Hospital on Sunday, officials said.
   The 7-month-old girls were in stable condition in an intensive
care unit following an eight-hour operation conducted by a team of
40 people.
   Dr. Goon Hong Kooi, one of two team leaders, told reporters the
operation left each girl with a liver that should function normally.
   He said the doctors used new equipment during the procedure.
   One device, an ultrasonic dissector, reduced bleeding during the
separation of the liver by allowing the doctors to break its cells
without damaging important blood vessels. The second device, a
tissue expander, was used to stretch the tissues, providing
additional skin to cover the girls' wounds.

   A strong earthquake and several mild
tremors struck southern Iran late Saturday and early Sunday,
injuring 17 people, destroying several homes and killing 100 head
of cattle, the official news agency said.
   The cattle were killed in Fars province, where the quake was
felt just before midnight in the cities of Mamasani, Shiraz and
Karzeroun, according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The Tehran geophysics center said the quake measured 5.9 on the
Richter scale and was centered 375 miles south of Tehran.
   Eight mild tremors hit Kohkiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad province,
resulting in the injuries and the damage to the homes, said IRNA,
monitored in Nicosia.
   In the cities of Boushehr, Gonaveh and Borazjan in Boushehr
province, frightened residents rushed into the streets during a
series of mild tremors.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. A quake measuring 6 on the scale can cause severe
damage.

<TEXT>
   Moslem rebels have launched a new
offensive to capture the embattled eastern Afghan city of
Jalalabad, but there were conflicting reports Sunday of their
success.
   Rebel sources said the mujahedeen, or Islamic ``holy warriors,''
began attacking communist government positions from all four sides
Saturday.
   They claimed to have captured several government military posts
and killed or wounded at least 70 communist troops. Rebels losses
were put at about 10 dead.
   However, official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad, said
government forces repulsed the attack and gained new territory
around the city. It said 55 ``enemy elements'' were killed and 46
were wounded.
   Both sides of the Afghan civil war often make exaggerated claims
that contradict each other and usually cannot be verified
independently.
   The mujahedeen, backed primarily by Pakistan and the United
States, have fought unsuccessfully for Jalalabad since March 6. The
battle began about three weeks after Soviet troops pulled the last
of their troops from Afghanistan, ending nine years of military
support for the Marxist government.
   Afghan forces still hold the country's major cities but the
guerrillas reportedly control more than 90 percent of the
countryside.
   Communist troops have withstood relentless rebel rocket and
artillery attacks on Jalalabad, where they still control the city
center and the military airport to the east.
   Guerrilla leaders earlier predicted that the Kabul government
would fall within weeks or months of the Soviet troop withdrawal.
   However, President Najib has said his forces' tenacious defense
of Jalalabad proves the guerrills cannot win a military victory in
Afghanistan.
   He has made repeated overtures for peace talks with the
insurgents, but they have refused.
   Mujahedeen leaders blame the ruling People's Democratic Party of
Afghanistan for inviting the Soviet military intervention. They
demand a complete capitulation of the Kabul government and the
establishment of an Islamic republic of Afghanistan.
   Fighting since the Soviet pullout has concentrated on Jalalabad,
42 miles west of the Pakistan border, and most recently Khost, a
garrison town to the south.
   Rebel commanders also say they are preparing an all-out assault
on Kabul.
   Guerrilas during the weekend claimed to have overrun at least
three government posts around Khost, killing 50 soldiers and
capturing four officers since Thursday. They said 18 rebels were
killed.
   Radio Kabul, however, claimed Saturday night that 173 mujahedeen
were killed and 32 were wounded.
   Foreign observers estimate that some 1.5 million Afghans have
died in the past 11 years of civil war. More than 5 million
Afghans, about one-third of the country's pre-war population of 15
million, live as refugees in Pakistan and Iran.

Radio Thailand reported Sunday.
   Up to 30 teams have been set up to test blood from people in
high-risk groups in major provinces, the state-run radio said.
   Testing will concentrate on prostitutes and drug addicts. Some
estimates put the number of prostitutes in Thailand at 1 million.
   The Public Health Ministry says more than 6,000 people in the
country have AIDS and that most of those afflicted are drug addicts.
   But the World Health Organization, which monitors the AIDS
epidemic worldwide, says the figure in Thailand is actually about
25,000.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is an affliction in which a
virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible
to a wide variety of infections and cancers.

   Twenty-three convicted drug traffickers
were hanged Sunday in Tehran, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   Twenty-one men were hanged in public, and two women were hanged
at a prison, the agency said in a report monitored in Nicosia. The
hangings raised the number of drug-related executions in Iran to
151 in the past two weeks.
   IRNA quoted an Islamic revolutionary court statement as saying
the drug traffickers were longtime smugglers who also were involved
in running brothels.
   Two of those hanged were Turkish nationals. Both were bus
drivers who smuggled more than 220 pounds of hashish and heroin
into Iran on several occasions, the agency said.
   It said several of those executed had previous narcotics
convictions and that one couple had resumed trafficking when they
were pardoned and freed while serving a life sentence.
   The hangings brought the number of drug-related executions to
709 since Iran launched a nationwide anti-narcotics crackdown in
December.

   The people of Burma, who saw their own
dreams of democracy brutally crushed last year, are gaining
inspiration from the student uprising in neighboring China.
   Defying an army ban on demonstrations, 12 students rallied
outside the Rangoon University campus one day last week and shouted
slogans supporting the students in China, a Western diplomat
reported.
   Tin Oo, chairman of the main opposition party, the National
League for Democracy, said Friday that authorities detained six
activists who pasted posters on trees in the capital proclaiming
support for the Chinese students. He said the activists sought
legal advice from him.
   Millions in Burma last year followed university students and
marched in the streets shouting for an end to decades of
repression. They forced the resignation of three presidents and
ended the one-party system, but today they still live under a
military-run government.
   The Burmese government's response to the protests was much
harsher than China's _ troops shot to death thousands of peaceful
demonstrators, and in September the military reestablished control
and banned protests.
   ``At least the Chinese government has some respect for the
students,'' said Moe Thi Zun, a 24-year-old student leader who fled
to the Thai border to escape arrest for organizing demonstrations.
``In Burma, the students were just shot down in the streets.''
   Before fleeing, he was head of the Democratic Party for a New
Society, the main student-led political party in Burma.
   At rallies this month, Aung San Suu Kyi, the other leader of the
National League for Democracy, contrasted the Chinese government's
attitude with the Burmese leaders' adamant refusal to make any
contact at all with dissidents. She was campaigning in the central
city of Mandalay for a general election that the government has
promised for May 1990.
   ``We started with a students' movement, so everyone has strong
feelings for what is happening in China,'' said Tin Oo, reached by
telephone in the Burmese capital, Rangoon.
   He was refering to the country's tradition of student activism,
beginning with the campaign that led to Burma's independence from
Great Britain in 1948.
   Burma's state-run press has carried nothing on the events in
China and the government has made no official comment. But people
have been following developments on the British Broadcasting Corp.
and the Voice of America.
   The uprising in China has boosted the morale of some of the
3,000 students who remain along the border with Thailand after
fleeing last year's military crackdown in the cities. They are
living in harsh conditions in the malarial jungles, where ethnic
groups are fighting a 40-year-old war for greater autonomy.
   ``It makes them realize they are not alone,'' Moe Thi Zun said.
``They can see there are people like them struggling for
democracy.''
   But he said many students are upset that the world press that
once ran the Burma uprising on its front pages now gives it little
coverage. ``It is particularly sad as the students in Burma went
through even greater hardships than those in China. Now it is not
worthy of page one, even though there are many still suffering.''

<TEXT>
   In a land where people must wait decades
for an apartment or telephone and pay inflated prices for scarce
goods, how does a party in power for nearly half a century run on
its record?
   Such is the dilemma facing the Polish United Workers Party as it
prepares for the June 4 elections to parliament, Poland's first
somewhat democratic balloting since World War II.
   The communists are being challenged by a well-organized,
emotionally driven opposition led by the newly legalized Solidarity
labor movement. Solidarity, with the luster of novelty and the aura
of idealism, is awash in campaign contributions and volunteers.
   At a converted coffee house in Warsaw's Constitution Square, the
headquarters of the Solidarity Citizens' Committee, workers almost
trip over each other to get out campaign literature, deliver
placards, sign up poll watchers and instruct citizens on voting
procedures.
   A few blocks away, in a state-owned department store, the
party-led coalition's campaign headquarters is almost empty. One
campaign workers is on duty, his piles of leaflets sitting idle and
unread.
   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, who ordered the
crackdown that led to Solidarity's suppression in 1981 and
initiated the conciliation that resulted in its legalization this
year, has said the communist party must be prepared to face the
electoral test.
   Party spokesman Jan Bisztyga said despite Poland's dire economic
problems, the party can point to some achievements during its 45
years in power.
   ``We had 45 years of peace. ... At all our borders, we had
friends. It means something,'' he said. ``We changed the classes in
our country. We had a majority of peasants.''
   Now, a majority has moved to an urban life, and ``we have a huge
intelligentsia.''
   All this took ``tremendous economic, social and political
effort,'' he said. ``So it is very unjust to enter the political
campaign looking for errors and defeats.''
   More important than the past is the future, he said. The party
is campaigning on the premise that it is the best bet for ensuring
political and economic reform. Of all the political forces in the
country, he said, the party is in the strongest position to
guarantee that reforms actually will be carried out.
   ``To say that the reforms just started now _ it is not true,''
he said. ``Always in our party, the communist party, it was a trend
to adopt our policy to the actual situation in Poland.''
   The party pitches itself as pragmatic and practical, implying
Solidarity is not. Banners around Warsaw say: ``With us, it's
surer,'' and ``We have a realistic program.''
   Missing is any reference to the communist party itself. Instead
of the party's Polish initials, PZPR, posters bear a logo with a
red mermaid, a city symbol used by the Warsaw ``coalition'' of
party candidates and those of allied groups.
   At stake in all of this are 460 seats in the existing
parliament, the Sejm, and 100 seats in the newly created Senate.
The opposition is allotted only 161 seats in the Sejm, with the
rest reserved for the communists. But the race for the Senate is
wide open.
   The new system was one of the agreements that came out of two
months of talks between the government and the Solidarity-led
opposition.
   Jaruzelski's regime agreed to the talks after a series of
crippling labor strikes last year. It is seeking Solidarity's help
in putting in place unpopular measures to overhaul the nation's
sickly economy.
   In return, among other things, Solidarity was made legal again
and elections were made freer.
   The Solidarity Citizens Committee has named just one candidate
for each of the parliament races it can enter.
   The party's slate is less clearly defined. For example, there
are more than 30 candidates on the ballot for three Senate seats
from Warsaw. Three represent Solidarity, but the party has never
clearly announced which of the others it supports.
   Wojciech Szymborski, a party propaganda department employee
manning the coalition's Warsaw campaign center, says that is
because the party wanted to let the people decide.
   Some opposition leaders have suggested the party's strategy
includes trying to confuse voters. Candidate names are to appear on
lengthy and complicated ballots with no indication of affiliation.
   Although the party has been in power since the reestablishment
of a Polish government after World War II and claims a membership
of 2 million (about 5 percent of the population), it has been
trailing the opposition in opening campaign offices, announcing a
platform and putting up posters.
   ``If you are talking about visual propaganda, for certain we
were behind the Solidarity side,'' Szymborski conceded, saying the
party was slower to pick its candidates.
   But he said the party is dealing more specifically with the
issues.
   ``Solidarity first of all is basing its campaign on its name and
its sign, and our campaign is more complicated and wider,'' he
grumbled.

   UNITED NATIONS _ A decade ago, police scrubbed down Beijing's
Democracy Wall and stifled the calls for political reform that
sowed the seeds of today's protests for greater freedom in China.
   Democracy Wall, so named because it was laden with posters
calling for democratic reform, came to represent the early
political dissent that was crushed by Deng Xiaoping, China's
supreme leader.
   The political tremors of 10 years ago presaged the current
upheaval by millions of student-led protesters, but there are major
differences between the so-called Beijing Spring of 1979 and that
of 1989.
   The movement then was mostly underground and disorganized and
involved a few thousand people, mostly working-class men. It was
far more strident and revolutionary than the past six weeks of
jubilant demonstrations in Beijing.
   Then, there were no live television interviews with loquacious,
hopeful demonstrators in Western clothes. There were no rock
concerts.
   In December, 1978 the United States and China restored
diplomatic relations. The next year witnessed the flowering and the
end of the Democracy Wall, in the same central square where today's
students have centered their protests.
   Ten years ago, the movement was fierce in rhetoric, more
negative than positive. Many dissidents likened Communism to
fascism and denounced Deng as a modern emperor and tyrant. They
didn't know exactly what they wanted, or how to get it, but they
knew they didn't want the status quo.
   ``We don't want Communism, socialism, capitalism or any other
`ism' _ we want nationalism and the best for China,'' dissidents
said.
   They were branded as counterrevolutionaries out to wreck Chinese
modernization.
   In 1979 it took a special courage to stand up to the powerful
state machinery that did not tolerate criticism. Ordinary citizens
were afraid to speak out in support of the demonstrators, poster
writers, artists and poets who clamored for change.
   Many were afraid to speak to foreigners, because they might be
interrogated by police.
   In demonstrations, police did not hesitate to disperse crowds
using force. Some who dared speak out were beaten and jailed, some
lost their jobs.
   One editor of an underground magazine, Wei Jingsheng, was tried
and convicted as a traitor in 1979. He was sentenced to 15 years in
a labor camp, where some say he went mad and died.
   But all that was before sweeping economic reforms gave people
greater independence and confidence, before glasnost and greater
freedom began to sweep the Communist world.
   Now, millions of people nationwide have defied the government
and martial law with marches and demands for democracy, party
reform and an end to endemic official corruption.
   Demonstrators have demanded the ouster of Deng and his hard-line
protege, Premier Li Peng. They have shouted, chanted, and they
blocked army tanks when Li declared martial law.
   About 3,000 went on a hunger strike.
   Though today's protest leaders face danger, there is official
recognition of legitimate demands for greater freedom.
   The men and women today are disciplined and organized, and more
important, they are backed by ordinary citizens. Their strength
lies in numbers, mass support, reasonable demands for reform and a
clean Communist government. They don't demand revolution.
   Even the government calls most of them patriots.
   The student demands have been treated sympathetically by the
official Chinese press, which has even joined the protests.
   Democracy Wall, a gray stone barricade between a bus yard and
central Tiananmen Square, was the focus of the movement 10 years
ago, when China was emerging from the Cultural Revolution and
beginning to open to the outside world.
   The wall, 200 yards long and three yards high, became a
billboard for big character posters, a staging ground for activism,
a gallery for dissident artists, and a marketplace for ideas and
unofficial magazines.
   It made headlines in November 1978 when Deng exploited it to
discredit political opponents who banished him during the Cultural
Revolution. Deng himself reportedly named it ``Democracy Wall.''
   ``Wall posters are not forbidden ... they are a constitutional
right and if the masses feel some anger, we must let them express
it,'' Deng said in late 1978.
   But he also said the masses sometimes were confused.
   Then, Deng, the architect of China's economic reforms and open
door, decided that free speech had gone too far.
   On Dec. 7, 1979, big character posters were prohibited. Workers
used scrapers, shovels, rakes, brooms, spatulas, steel wool and
eradicated the offending posters _ but not the ideas.

<HEAD>Official Report Says Soviet Troops Planned Massacre in Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soldiers planned to massacre people during a
pro-independence rally last month in Soviet Georgia and used clubs
to beat the injured and the elderly, an official report says.
   The report, issued by a Georgian commission that looked into the
April 9 clash that left 19 dead, was circulated among deputies to
the new Soviet parliament, which met during the weekend.
   The report calls for the parliament, the Congress of People's
Deputies, to condemn the incident and determine who exactly was
responsible.
   ``Otherwise,'' the report said, ``a shadow will be laid across
the Soviet government as a whole.''
   The report gives a horrifying account of troops' behavior in the
4 a.m. clash with protesters. It also supports claims of Georgian
activists who accused soldiers of extreme brutality.
   Soldiers ``blocked crossings, surrounded citizens and beat them
with clubs and shovels. They did not spare hunger strikers, girls,
old women, doctors and Red Cross workers. They pursued people who
were running away and beat the wounded even more, tearing them from
the hands of medical personnel,'' the report says.
   ``We come to the conclusion that the action taken ... carries
the signs of a punitive operation _ a planned mass massacre,
committed with special cruelty,'' the commission reported.
   The panel, sponsored by the Georgian parliament, also said
Georgian television announced a curfew the day after the clash only
four minutes before it went into effect, so many residents were
caught on the streets unaware. One young man was shot and killed
for violating the curfew.
   It said the Soviet media distorted coverage of the clash and its
aftermath and it blamed local leaders for ``complete isolation from
the people.''
   A medical subcommittee's findings repeated widespread criticism
of the Defense and Interior Ministries for not telling doctors for
several days exactly what sort of gas was used to control
protesters.
   Western doctors who conducted autopsies have said the gases,
described as suffocants, caused some of the deaths.
   Also, more than 4,000 people have required treatment, mainly for
poisoning, and diagnosis and treatment would have been much easier
if authorities had acknowledged earlier that they used a chemical
agent, the report said.
   A Soviet magazine recently carried an interview with Georgian
chief Prosecutor Vakhtang Razmadze, who said representatives of the
Communist Party, the government and the military attended the
meeting at which the decision was made to use troops to break up
the demonstration.
   They included Georgian party chief Zhumber Patiashvili, who
later resigned, General Igor Rodionov, the regional military
commander, who is now a deputy at the Congress, and a deputy
national defense minister.
   The account was consistent with a claim made Thursday by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the Congress. He said he and
other Politburo members found out about the decision to bring in
troops only hours after the damage was done.
   Protests began in Tbilisi, Georgia's capital, in early April in
response to demands by the Abkhazian minority in northwest Georgia
to have their area transferred to the Russian republic.

<HEAD>Are Public Service Spots Effective? The Reviews Are Mixed</HEAD>

   A fried egg sizzles and burns on the
television screen as an ominous voice intones: ``This is your brain
on drugs.''
   Another ad depicts a medical machine recording the active brain
waves of a typical 14-year-old followed by the somewhat deadened
brain waves of a 14-year-old after smoking marijuana.
   The advertisements are brought to the screen by advertisers who
have voluntarily collaborated on the efforts, and by TV networks
that have provided millions of dollars worth of free air time.
   But do they work?
   Some _ including the Media-Advertising Partnership for a
Drug-Free America and its sister organization, The Advertising
Council _ maintain they are effective in changing public attitudes
about drug use. That position is supported by William J. Bennett,
director of the federal Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   Others say the ads are a waste of money.
   Don Des Jarlais, an epidemiologist who works with heroin and
cocaine addicts in New York City, said when the addicts do refer to
the ads, it's ``derisively.''
   ``They're not aimed at addicts,'' he said. ``They're aimed at
people not using or casual users. The preliminary data I've seen
indicate they do change some attitudes, but in terms of actually
changing drug use, that remains to be seen.''
   John Condry, a Cornell University professor who has spent the
past year at the Center for Research on the Influences of
Television on Children at the University of Kansas, said television
is delivering too many mixed messages for the ads to have an impact.
   Condry said he has found that the ratio of pro-drug to anti-drug
messages on television was 8-to-1, including programs and
advertisements showing people smoking, drinking or taking medicines.
   Even legitimate ads for such things as over-the-counter pain
medications send the wrong message, he contended.
   ``While it's not illegal, what they are saying is if you don't
like the state you're in, if you have a headache, you take a drug
... take some sort of substance to change how you feel,'' Condry
said.
   ``For a child, it's not clear there's a distinction between one
drug and another _ a pill's a pill,'' he said.
   Peggy Charren, president of Action for Children's Television,
said the money spent to make and broadcast the public service ads
could be better spent on education.
   The ``Just Say No'' ad effort promoted by The Advertising
Council ``seems to me the kind of campaign that kids who are
dealing in drugs laugh at,'' she said.
   ``It's not that I think these (advertisements) are damaging,''
Charren said. ``What's damaging about it is that it makes the
society feel we're doing something. It makes the ad industry feel
it's OK to advertise the products of their clients in programs that
glamorize crime in the streets, violence against women and the
culture that gives rise to drug dealing.
   ``It's conscience money for a society that is not taking care of
that part of the population that's most likely to get involved in
drugs,'' she said.
   But Lloyd D. Johnston, program director for the Institute for
Social Research at the University of Michigan, praised the
effectiveness of the advertising campaigns.
   Johnston, co-director of the 1988 national survey of high school
seniors that indicated a decrease in illicit drug use credited the
ads with having a substantial impact.
   ``I personally believe the partnership's efforts played an
important role in helping to bring about these changes, and the
young people we survey seem to believe it as well,'' Johnston wrote
to the Partnership for a Drug-Free America. ``They report a very
high level of recalled exposure to the anti-drug advertising, a
high degree of credibility in the content, and most important, a
high judged impact on their own drug-using behaviors and
attitudes.''
   The annual University of Michigan survey is backed by the
federal government and has won acceptance over the years as the
best measure of high school drug use. But it makes no pretense of
measuring drug use among the 15 percent who drop out of school and
are more prone to drug use.
   David Clemm, chief operating officer of the polling firm of
Gordon S. Black Corp. _ hired by the American Association of
Advertising Agencies to survey the anti-drug ads' impact _ said the
survey found they were effective when they got a lot of air time.
   ``In the areas where we were able to get more exposure, we were
having an impact,'' Clemm said. ``Among key groups, we were seeing
changing attitudes and perceptions, changes in drug use.''
   The partnership has been responsible for some 70 different TV
commercials, and Clemm noted that different ads affect different
groups.
   ``There isn't one single message that will work with every
group,'' he said.
   Younger children, ages 9 and up, respond more to ads questioning
whether the drug pushers and drug users are really such cool
characters, ``the big men on campus, the people you want to be
friends with,'' Clemm said, basing his remarks on interviews over
two years with some 14,000 people.
   Older teens and college students responded to ``concern over
what their younger brothers and sisters might do because of their
actions'' and adults were affected by depictions of the possible
impacts on their work performance, whether they might endanger
others as well as themselves by taking drugs, Clemm said.
   Bennett cited the Gordon Black study when he said in an
interview that the advertising ``does work. It works not for the
hard-core addict, but it does work for a person who's a casual
user.'' In addition, he said, it helps prevent people from starting
to use drugs, ``if you get the right ad.''
   Theresa Venet Grant of the Partnership for a Drug-Free America
rejected Charren's contention that the commercials represent
``conscience money.''
   ``I think these ads work,'' she said. ``I think there's a
changing tone in the entire entertainment industry'' that
eliminates qualms advertisers might have in supporting programs
while also participating in anti-drug efforts.
   Among the shows she cited as making a ``conscious effort to
deglamorize drug use'' were ``21 Jump Street,'' ``Growing Pains''
and ``Family Ties.''
   ``To say the industry doesn't care, that's just as irresponsible
as saying that we don't have a problem,'' Grant said.

<HEAD>Analysts Predict U.S.-British Relationship Will Thrive Under Bush</HEAD>

   The special relationship forged between Britain
and the United States during Ronald Reagan's presidency will thrive
under George Bush but on a more businesslike footing, analysts
predict.
   That relationship is likely to be nurtured at the annual NATO
summit in Brussels, beginning Monday.
   Mrs. Thatcher is siding with Bush in a dispute with West Germany
over short-range nuclear missiles in Europe. West Germany has
demanded that the West open negotiations with the East to reduce
the number of missiles, while the United States and Britain want to
modernize the weapons.
   After the summit, and a stop in Bonn, West Germany, Bush is
scheduled to travel to London on Thursday for talks with Mrs.
Thatcher.
   Mrs. Thatcher had made a point of meeting with Bush during his
two terms as vice president, and following his election in November
described him as a ``worthy successor'' to Reagan.
   Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher were ideological soul mates who
operated on a first-name basis and with obvious personal warmth
during the eight years that their conservative administrations
overlapped.
   Things aren't likely to be as folksy with Bush.
   ``I don't think the chemistry's going to be there,'' said John
Young, faculty member of the London School of Economics
international history department.
   ``I think there's going to be less warmth there. I think there
was genuine mutual admiration between Ronald Reagan and Margaret
Thatcher because they are kind of believing people,'' Young said.
   ``They believe in a cause to fight for and they admire each
other for standing up and fighting ... President Bush, through his
background, is far more a wheeler-dealer kind of character,'' he
said.
   Charles H. Price II, Reagan's ambassador to Britain, predicted
Bush's relations with Mrs. Thatcher will be even closer than his
predecessor's because both are ``hands-on'' managers.
   ``I think with George Bush, in a sense, she will have a more
special relationship than Ronald Reagan had,'' Price told American
reporters before returning to the United States.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger agreed, telling
Britain's Sky Television:
   ``The relationship, good as it was between President Reagan and
Mrs. Thatcher, will be at least as good, if not better, between
President Bush and Prime Minister Thatcher.
   ``Mr. Reagan based his relationship very much on personal
intuition,'' Kissinger said. ``President Bush is a man who is more
reflective about the conceptual matters.''
   Peter Jay, Britain's ambassador to Washington from 1977-79, said
personal relations between leaders has little impact on policy or
decision making.
   But he pinpointed one factor that he said could make Bush's
relations with the British leader different from Reagan's.
   ``President Bush actually knows about and is interested in
government and Mrs. Thatcher knows about and is interested in
government both at the national and international level,'' Jay said.
   Mrs. Thatcher has regularly backed the United States _ sometimes
alone.
   Britain was the first to deploy U.S. cruise missiles in Europe
in 1983, and it was the only ally to support the 1986 U.S. bombing
raid on Libya.
   Despite her personal reservations, Mrs. Thatcher publicly
endorsed the 1987 U.S.-Soviet agreement to remove the missiles, and
in January, Royal Air Force Base Molesworth, 50 miles north of
London, became the first NATO cruise missile base to be disarmed.
   Reagan, in turn, approved vital arms supplies and intelligence
to Britain during the 1982 Falkland Islands War against Argentina.

<HEAD>Immigrant Turks Stone Bulgarian Consulate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of ethnic Turks stoned and broke
the windows of the Bulgarian consulate on Sunday to protest
Bulgaria's treatment of its ethnic Turkish minority, the Anatolia
news agency said.
   The agency said the stoning occurred after about 500 Turks
gathered in front of the building for a protest organized by the
Association for Solidarity With Balkan Turks.
   It said the protesters placed a black coffin and two black
wreaths at the consulate gate and then began hurling stones.
   The protesters burned a picture of Bulgarian President Todor
Zhivkov during the protest, which lasted about an hour, the report
said.
   Bulgaria started an assimilation campaign in 1984 by forcing the
estimated 900,000 ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to
Slavic ones. According to the human rights group Amnesty
International, about 100 Turks have died in violence resulting from
resistance to the assimilation campaign.
   The consulate phone was repeatedly busy during attempts to reach
Bulgarian officials for comment.
   Anatolia said another group of Turks placed a black wreath at
Bulgaria's consulate in the city of Edirne.
   A group of 167 ethnic Turks deported from Bulgaria arrived in
Istanbul Friday and four other Turks flew in from Belgrade on
Saturday night.
   Most of those deported were leaders of a movement to resist the
Bulgarian campaign. They reported that at least 30 people died and
200 others were seriously injured recently in Bulgaria during
clashes with Bulgarian security forces.

<HEAD>$3.7 Billion Spending Bill: A Case Study in What Drives Congress</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bill to boost federal spending this year by
less than 1 percent has set Democrat against Democrat and the House
against the Senate in a classic case study of the dynamics that
drive Congress.
   The bloodletting has been sparked by a $3.7 billion domestic
spending bill the House approved last Wednesday and the Senate
plans to debate this week.
   The measure is a routine one at this point in the federal fiscal
year, which ends Sept. 30. The supplemental spending bills
traditionally provide funds for agencies that find themselves
needing more money for the final few months of a year.
   But as usual, there is more to it than that and the more has
touched off skirmishing among many of the capital's power centers.
   The White House and House Democrats have been feuding over the
measure since shortly after March 24, when President Bush asked
Congress for a $2.2 billion version of the bill. The House
Appropriations Committee, which originates spending legislation,
expanded it to a $4.7 billion package before slicing $1 billion
from it last week.
   The $1 billion cut ``is not enough,'' White House budget
director Richard Darman complained to congressional leader last
Wednesday.
   A provision supplying $822 million for a host of anti-drug
programs has touched off battling between Democrats and Republicans
in the House, all of them already looking at elections next year
and beyond.
   Aware of opinion polls showing that the public considers illegal
drugs to be the nation's worst problem, the House's majority
Democrats had inserted the drug funds into the bill.
   This sparked a Bush administration veto threat against the
measure, arguing that there is no reason to inflate this year's
federal deficit by supplementing law enforcement agencies that
already have more money than they can spend. The result was floor
debate in which members of each party sought to embarrass the other.
   Rep. Ben Jones, D-Ga., described a rising ``body count'' from
drugs and asked, ``How long are we going to wait until we recognize
the clear call of the American people.''
   But House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill., said the
measure's drug spending was designed by Democrats ``to build a
partisan record to be used against incumbents in next year's
election.''
   The fighting spilled over into the Democratic Party itself.
Liberals, stymied for months by bipartisan budget deals that
stifled many of their priorities, were allowed to offer an
amendment that would have transferred hundreds of millions of
dollars from anti-missile research to drug programs.
   The provision was defeated 213-205 with 47 Democrats voting in
opposition. One opponent, Appropriations defense subcommittee
Chairman John Murtha, D-Pa., bolstered his case for the military's
need for money for training and other programs by describing
children crying at the memorial service for the victims of the
fatal explosion aboard the battleship U.S.S. Iowa.
   But the liberals got their licks in, too. They pointed out that
the position of their mostly Republican opponents was in stark
contrast to President Bush's repeated pronouncements against what
he has called ``the scourge of drugs.''
   ``It is about time we put our money where our mouth is,''
taunted Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   On another level, the bill has churned up the age-old struggle
between the House and Senate over whose pet projects get financed.
The bill, which originated in the House, so far contains only that
chamber's version of what it says needs to be done.
   Members of the Senate have yet to be heard from, including
Appropriations Committee Chairman Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who gave up
his post of majority leader this year after making clear he
intended to use his new job to help his home state win its share of
federal largesse.
   Byrd made his presence known two weeks ago when the House broke
$1.2 billion for veterans out of the overall bill and into a
separate measure, and sent the legislation to the Senate.
   The veterans' money is virtually sacrosanct politically, but
Byrd and Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon, ranking Republican on the
Appropriations Committee, reduced the size of the measure. The
effect was to keep the agency going for awhile longer, but not
until the new budget year begins Oct. 1.
   Byrd and Hatfield made clear that they wanted a later bill
containing the rest of the veterans' money to carry with it money
for projects the Senate considers important.
   Among the measures the Senate is expected to seek money for is a
$6.6 million boost to the program that subsidizes airlines
servicing remote communities, and $75 million to rebuild a radio
telescope that collapsed last winter in West Virginia.
   The Senate also plans to strip the anti-drug money from the
House bill as part of a deal with the White House for a compromise
spending package, according to congressional aides who asked to not
be identified.
   Thus, a clash looms between Byrd and House Appropriations
Chairman Jamie Whitten, D-Miss., a wily veteran of congressional
spending wars who has been in Congress for 48 of his 79 years.
   ``Jamie has met his match in Byrd,'' one congressional aide said.

   Young men bring in the concepts and Reginald
Potts executes the designs _ on their heads.
   For ``Bigg Regg'' and a growing number of other barbers these
days, a little art school training is about as useful as ability
with the clippers. They don't just cut hair _ they sculpt scalps.
   ``I've seen some crazy haircuts,'' Potts said as he chiseled
shortwaves, or vertical lines, into the hair of 18-year-old Lorenzo
Davis.
   ``Kids come in here showing me pictures of some rap star or
something they drew at school and say `Can you do this?'''
   Other popular scalp designs include nicknames and shoe emblems.
Potts said he always has a customer in his chair and a customer
waiting.
   In Mount Clemens, barber Darren Campbell said he sculpts about
80 ``line dimension'' haircuts a week, charging up to $20.
   ``I do it all freehand. That's the art of it. And if I make a
mistake, there's no erasing,'' Campbell said. ``If I make one
mistake I have to cut it all off.''
   ``That's why it's an art form, and that's why there are not too
many barbers who will do it,'' he said.
   Keith Bell, 16, a Mount Clemens High School freshman, said his
Nike gym shoe logo haircut got mixed reactions at home.
   ``My mother didn't like it. She said it was stupid,'' Bell said.
``But my dad liked it. He said it was different.''

   Lester ``Junior'' Gorman never liked a big
crowd, and that kept him from getting his diploma when he refused
to go to his high school graduation ceremony a half-century ago.
   He was missing again this year when the names of the Tonkawa
High School Class of 1939 were listed for a reunion. But this time
the gap did not go unnoticed.
   Gorman, who now lives in Pharr, Texas, will get his diploma in
the mail this week, 50 years after he graduated.
   ``Back in those days, if you didn't go through the ceremony and
wear the cap and gown, you didn't get a diploma,'' said Mary Lou
Gorman, his sister-in-law. ``Junior was pig-headed enough not to do
it, and he didn't like crowds.''
   Mrs. Gorman said her husband, Lee, realized some months ago that
his brother never received his diploma when his name was not on the

   In Louisiana, people have a legal right
to inherit part of the estate when one of their parents dies. But
the law lists 12 ``sins of the children'' under which parents can
disinherit their sons or daughters:
   1. Striking a parent. (A mere threat is not sufficient.)
   2. Injuring a parent, or committing a crime against the parent.
   3. Attempting to murder a parent.
   4. Accusing a parent of a capital crime, except treason.
   5. Refusing to give a parent sustenance.
   6. Neglecting a parent who is insane.
   7. Refusing to ransom a parent.
   8. Using violence or coercion to keep a parent from making a
will.
   9. Refusing to post bond for a parent.
   10. Marrying without the consent of a parent. (Minors only)
   11. Committing a felony punishable by life in prison or death.
   12. Failing to contact the parent for two years.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Religious Faith Has Little Impact On Sexual Behavior</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 80 percent of college students say
religion is important in their lives but their faith has relatively
little impact on their sexual behavior and attitudes, according to
a new campus survey.
   Half the 539 students questioned in a Gallup poll commissioned
by the Christian Broadcasting Network said they read the Bible at
least occasionally and 55 percent said they had attended church or
synagogue in the month preceding the survey.
   A full 42 percent said religion is ``very important'' to them
while another 37 percent said it is somewhat important. Only 6
percent identified themselves as atheists or agnostics.
   Nevertheless, 69 percent of the students said they do not
believe premarital sex is wrong and 56 percent said they approve of
living together in trial marriages. Half said they approve of the
current status of abortion rights, with 9 percent of female
students saying they had had an abortion and 15 percent of the
males saying their partners had had one.
   Responding to other questions on their own sexual practices,
three quarters of the students said they had engaged in sex and
half said they have had more than one partner. A quarter said they
have had five or more partners. Another quarter said they were
virgins.
   ``On the one hand, we were pleased that the majority of college
students in America find religion somewhat important,'' said Susan
Norman, a senior editor at CBN. ``But we were disappointed to see
that even though they believe in God, their faith doesn't seem to
have much of an effect on their personal lives and habits, their
sexual attitudes and practices.''
   Gallup conducted the survey in March at 100 two-year and
four-year campuses, using a sample statistically representative of
college students nationwide. The margin of error is 6 percent.
   The survey found that religion had the most impact on the
lifestyles and attitudes of the 23 percent of the students who
identified themselves as evangelicals or born-again Christians.
   More than half of the evangelicals said they oppose premarital
sex, two-thirds said they think living together before marriage is
wrong, and 71 percent said they oppose abortion in the first
trimester of pregnancy.
   Catholic students, representing 29 percent of the survey,
strayed furthest from the teachings of their church. The survey
found that three out of four approve of premarital sex and divorce
on the grounds of incompatibility; 59 percent approve of trial
marriages; and 53 percent approve of abortion rights.
   Protestants, making up 48 percent of those surveyed, fell in the
middle. The samples of Jewish students and those of other religions
were too small to be analyzed separately.
   The survey found that evangelicals went to church and read the
Bible far more frequently than any other group. ``Maybe the key to
having your faith affect your personal life is to have your faith
practiced with action, and also to have that community of support
for morality through the church,'' Norman said.
   The students' broadest consensus was in opposing adultery. Asked
how important it is for a married couple to have sexual relations
only with each other, 92 percent said very important.
   ``I guess what they're saying is that it's okay to experiment a
little bit before marriage but after marriage they expect their
spouses to be faithful to them,'' Norman said.
   Poll director Bob Bezilla attributed the finding partially to
the impact of AIDS.
   ``The return to the monogamous family and all is a very, very
strong instinct right now,'' he said. ``If we had asked that
question pre-AIDs, let's face it, there were an awful lot of
one-night stands and a much more liberal atmosphere. It may be a
practical matter for some (people).''
   On another issue, the survey found that 66 percent of the female
students would like to be married, have children and hold a
full-time job or career outside the home. The least popular option
was being married with no children and no outside job _ chosen by
only 1 percent. And only 9 percent of the women said they wanted to
be married with children but no outside job.

   This Memorial Day will be special for 24
students in Mary Munson's first-period English class. It coincides
with John F. Kennedy's birthday, and the students think it's an apt
day to honor the late president.
   The Lincoln Middle School students plan a memorial get-together
in Kennedy's honor, and have even persuaded state lawmakers to
endorse their notion that the late president should be honored on
the day he was born, not the day he died.
   ``The students had a grand idea,'' state Rep. John Medinger said.
   Medinger credits the students for a resolution enacted last
week. In it, the state legislature asked Congress to honor Kennedy
annually on May 29, his birthday, instead of Nov. 22, the date of
his assassination in 1963.
   Ms. Munson said the class originally learned by accident that
Kennedy's birthday was May 29, which happens to be Memorial Day
this year. They realized then that they didn't know much about him,
she said.
   After doing some research, the students made a pamphlet, buttons
and posters to promote awareness of the nation's 35th president.
   ``For 25 years we've focused on Kennedy's death,'' the pamphlet
says. ``We believe it is time to move on.''
   Kennedy would have turned 72 on Monday.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told more
than 300,000 religous pilgrims Sunday that upcoming parliamentary
elections are the biggest step toward democracy in 45 years of
communist rule.
   At the biggest campaign rally so far, Walesa urged Poles to vote
in the June 4 election, the first somewhat democratic vote in
Poland since World War II.
   ``Many people don't believe. They ask, `Are the communists
giving something away? That's impossible. It is a cheat,''' he
said. ``This is the best chance in 45 years to fulfill our hopes
and desires.''
   The opposition will vie with Communist Party candidates for all
100 seats in a newly created Senate and 161 of 460 places in the
Sejm, the existing parliament. The elections were set up last month
after talks between Solidarity and the government.
   Political reforms agreed to during the talks included
reinstating the Solidarity trade union after a seven-year ban.
Solidarity's political faction put up candidates for all available
seats.
   Arriving on foot from the coal and steel-producing regions, the
pilgrims streamed up a hillside where Walesa sat on an alter beside
Krakow's Cardinal Franciszek Macharski. He is the second-ranking
church official in the predominantly Roman Catholic country.
   ``Sometimes we must pray or sing together,'' Walesa said. ``It
is the time for team play and not individual play. Today the team
called Solidarity is playing against the team called government
coalition.''
   The pilgrims, who each year trek to the Piekary shrine in
southern Poland, welcomed Walesa enthusiastically.
   Although the cardinal did not speak about Solidarity, he
introduced Walesa to the crowd.
   The church has wide influence in Poland and played a key role in
setting up negotiations between the opposition and the government.
When Solidarity was illegal, union leaders found sanctuary in many
churches.

   NATO leaders pondering U.S. and Soviet
troops reductions in Europe will be under close scrutiny during
their two-day meeting from another army at record strength: summit
journalists.
   Sparks of disunity in the 16-nation alliance have drawn a throng
of 1,600 reporters to cover NATO's 40th anniversary celebration.
   Last year, when NATO leaders came here to pat each other on the
back for the alliance's success, about 1,200 journalists showed up
to ply the hallways and briefing rooms of the sprawling NATO
complex.
   Compared to many other summits, where world leaders meet to
ceremonially rubber stamp earlier decisions, the current NATO
summit features tension, suspense and an unpredictable outcome.
   ``It has become a very good story,'' said ABC assignment editor
Marcus Wilford.
   The meeting will pit U.S. President George Bush and British
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher against alliance maverick West
Germany on whether the United States should open talks with the
Soviet Union on reduction of short-range missiles.
   West Germany's open support of a new round of arms talks breaks
with NATO defense doctrine and has created a rift within the
alliance.
   Bush is also rumored to be planning announcement of a withdrawal
of some U.S. troops from Europe, a public relations counterpoint to
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's offers to reduce conventional
forces in Eastern Europe.
   Usually ``you pretty much know what to expect'' at the outset,
``but this time the controversy makes it more complicated,'' said
NBC producer Ted Elbert.
   The U.S. media top NATO's accreditation list with 450
journalists, many traveling with Bush throughout his four-nation
European tour.
   The U.S. networks each have 40 to 50 people in Brussels,
including their anchormen. European networks have also massed in
Brussels for the summit.
   ``News formats are getting more similar wherever you go,''
commented British professor Graham Murdock, a specialist on the
media.
   The dozen reporters sent by Soviet media remain an exception and
their coverage is again expected to closely reflect the government
line, said Brian McNair of Ulster University.
   ``Glasnost has not substantially changed the way that the Soviet
media report on foreign affairs,'' he said. ``There will be no
debate whether the Soviet government is right.''
   Strong coverage of events like the NATO summit can earn the U.S.
networks an edge in their ongoing ratings war.
   But the ``talking heads'' that dominate news conferences and
briefings at such summits are unlikely to offer any footage as
dramatic as a million flag-waving demonstrators in Beijing
threatening to topple the Chinese government.
   ``It is a problem we always face when we cover stories that
involve intellectual concepts rather than `bang-bang' footage,''
said CBS special events producer Mark Kramer. ``It is a challenge.''
   The U.S. networks went out in force to cover the protests in
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, and some are now paying the piper.
   Some producers complain that equipment from Beijing that was
supposed to be forwarded to Brussels got held up at Chinese
customs. Some personnel arrived late and tired, or not at all,
forcing the networks to scramble for replacements.
   Absent crews may not regret missing the chance to toil in the 30
trailers where film and videos are processed outside NATO's press
center. The trailers have been turned into saunas by a spell of
torrid temperatures making this the hottest May of the century.

   An aging Italian war veteran stood
silently in a cheering crowd at the U.S. military cemetery Sunday,
straining to hear President Bush. Pasquali Fernando doesn't speak
English, but he understood the message.
   ``We are here to honor the men who have fallen in war,'' said
Fernando as he stood beside a field of white marble tombstones
where Bush gave a Memorial Day weekend speech paying tribute to
Americans killed in World War II.
   ``I hid American and British soldiers from the Germans,''
Fernando said proudly.
   Each of the 7,860 graves was decorated with American and Italian
flags and with a single pink chrysanthemum.
   Thousands of Italians and a handful of Americans stood on the
grassy mall in front of the memorial where Bush spoke. Some waved
small American and Italian flags they were given at the gate. Some
cheered the president they could barely see and a few wilted in the
heat. They were carried to the shade by U.S. Navy medics.
   ``I like Bush simply because he is the president of the United
States,'' said Fernando, pulling a tattered document from his
pocket.
   The paper signed by British Field Marshall H.R. Alexander,
supreme Allied commander in the Mediterranean in World War II,
thanked Fernando for helping Allied soldiers escape or avoid
capture.
   Not everyone in Nettuno shared Fernando's sentiments.
   Bush's earlier arrival at St. Francis Roman Catholic Church to
attend Mass was delayed briefly when about 40 right-wing
demonstrators vaulted barricades and formed a human pyramid in
front of the president's motorcade.
   None made an attempt to reach Bush or his limousine. Police
removed them in about three minutes and took 15 to nearby Anzio for
questioning. The demonstrators said they belonged to the Destra
Nazionale MSI (National Right Italian Social Movement), Italy's
neo-fascist and fourth largest political party.
   The protesters tossed handbills that questioned whether the
Allied troops that waded ashore at Nettuno and Anzio on Jan. 22,
1944, were liberators or invaders.
   ``Americans would like to continue to present themselves as the
only wall of defense of democratic liberties,'' the fliers said.
   Inside the cemetery, 25 Soviet Jews who said they had been
denied U.S. visas sought out American reporters, asking them to
call their plight to Bush's attention.
   ``We were refuseniks in the Soviet Union and now we are
refusniks in Italy,'' said Valerie Poljakov of Kiev.
   They said Nettuno authorities had denied them permission to
demonstrate silently along the motorcade route and wave banners
urging Bush to help them get visas.
   Most of those in the cemetery crowd said they came just to see
an American president. They began arriving hours ahead of Bush's
brief appearance, standing in long lines to pass through metal
detectors and have their handbags searched by security police.
   The legacy of the American war dead was dramatized by the sight
of three uniformed baseball teams of boys who joined the throng.

   Looking out over a gentle field of white
crosses, President Bush told the story Sunday of a young soldier
from Ohio whose heroism 45 years ago earned him the Medal of Honor
and burial under the pines of Nettuno.
   The people of Sgt. Sylvester Antolak's hometown, St.
Clairsville, will gather this Memorial Day at the steps of the
Belmont County Courthouse to dedicate a white granite memorial to
the local hero who helped defeat fascist Italy during World War II.
   Speaking at a U.S. military cemetery where 7,860 American war
dead are buried, Bush said Antolak led Staff Sgt. Audie Murphy, the
highly decorated American war hero, and his troops in a bold charge
against a machine gun nest blocking the road to Rome.
   There, near Cisterna, Italy, Antolak was cut down three times by
gunfire and repeatedly struggled back to his feet, tucking his gun
under a shattered arm, Bush said.
   ``By the time he disabled the gunners, 10 enemy soldiers
surrendered to this man whom their bullets could not stop,'' the
president said.
   Antolak, the second youngest of 11 children of Polish
immigrants, fell near Cisterna on the same day and was buried at
the Nettuno cemetery in a grave marked by the Medal of Honor.
   ``The cost of maintaining freedom is brought home to us all when
tragedy strikes,'' Bush said, citing Antolak as an American who
understood the cost of freedom.
   At the St. Clairsville ceremony Monday, he said, Antolak's
brothers, George and Stanley, ``will be there to remember their
brother _ their hero, and ours.''
   In St. Clairsville, Stanley Antolak, 76, said Sunday that he was
surprised that Bush would mention him and his brothers in the
cemetery speech in Italy. ``That's pretty special,'' he said. ``I
never expected it.''
   Stanley said he remembered his fallen brother, Sylvester, as ``a
farmer, a carpenter, a hunter ... an all-round country boy.''
   After his tribute to American war dead, Bush paid a surprise
visit by helicopter to the U.S. aircraft carrier Guadalcanal, which
was anchored in nearby waters.
   ``We only had 10 minutes; we wanted to show the flag,'' Bush
told Capt. John McKay of Virginia Beach, Va., when he arrived with
first lady Barbara Bush.
   The president's impromptu visit was clearly a surprise for some
of the Guadalcanal's crew. As the president and his wife headed for
McKay's cabin, one sailor scurried by from his morning shower
wearing only a towel.

<TEXT>
   A special education student who alleges
she was sexually assaulted by several teen-age boys says she had
considered them her friends, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The girl, who turned 18 on Wednesday, also said she is upset
that the media has portrayed her as mentally retarded, according to
a copyright interview in The Record of Hackensack.
   ``I thought I did trust them, mostly I did,'' she said. ``I
trusted them. I knew them all my life.''
   The Essex County prosecutor's office says the assault took place
March 1 in the basement of the home of two teens charged in the
case, 18-year-old twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer. The arrests have
shaken this affluent suburb 20 miles west of New York City.
   The Scherzers, Peter Quigley, 18, and two unidentified
juveniles, all students at Glen Ridge High School, were arrested
last week on charges of sexually assaulting the girl with a
miniature baseball bat and broomstick.
   Eight other male teens, including the son of a Glen Ridge police
lieutenant, watched but did nothing to help the young woman,
authorities said.
   Prosecutor Herbert Tate said the hour-long assault occurred
after the 13 youths, all acquaintances of the victim, accompanied
her from a local park to the Scherzer home. The twins are captains
of the football team. Kyle also is captain of the baseball team.
   The girl, whose identity has not been released, said she went to
the park that afternoon and saw a group of boys, friends of hers,
playing baseball. She attends special education classes at West
Orange High School but plays varsity sports for Glen Ridge.
   After the game, she said, they asked her to go with them to the
Scherzer residence.
   ``They said, `We want to talk to you. We won't hurt you,''' she
said.
   She declined to talk about what happened in the Scherzer
basement, except to say that beer and drugs were not involved. She
also said only three of the accused participated in the assault.
   ``Some of it was force, and some of it I allowed, because they
wouldn't think I'd like them (if I didn't),'' she said.
   The girl also said she was disturbed by her depiction as
mentally retarded. In announcing the arrests last week, Tate told
reporters she was retarded.
   ``They're just trying to get news,'' she said.
   The article described her as stylishly dressed, with eyes that
sparkled except when she discussed the incident. She said she does
well in math and English, and in sports such as softball and
basketball.
   She also said she gets some nasty comments from other students
at West Orange High.
   ``They're teasing me,'' she said. ``They say, `Oh, that's you,
the girl with the broomstick and the bat.'
   ``It's no big deal. ... It's not bothering me.''
   But she admits that she does worry about the boys who were
arrested.
   ``I do feel bad,'' she said. ``Those were my friends. I thought
I could trust them.''

   Movie star Rob Lowe's attorney said his client
probably will comment this week on allegations he induced an
underage girl into having sex in an Atlanta hotel room and
videotaped the action.
   Lawyer Edgar Neely III of Atlanta said he expects Lowe to say he
is not the man who appears in the videotape, encouraging a
16-year-old girl to have sex with another woman.
   ``At this point, as far as I know he's denying it,'' the lawyer
said.
   Lowe, 25, who has appeared in such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire''
and ``About Last Night,'' has not commented publicly on the
allegations, which are the subject of a lawsuit filed by the girl's
mother and an investigation.
   Fulton County District Attorney Lewis Slaton has said he is
convinced it is Lowe on the tape and is seeking to interview the
actor.
   Meanwhile, the New York Daily News reported Sunday that copies
of the videotape can be bought in Atlanta for $500 to $1,000, and
that it is being shown at nightclubs around the city.

   Singer-songwriter John Mellencamp thinks it's a
cause worth taking up _ saving a rock 'n' roll shrine where Chuck
Berry, the Rolling Stones, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley made
recording history.
   Mellencamp and his band recorded a 90-minute performance aimed
at generating support for the preservation of Chess Studios on
Chicago's South Side. It will be broadcast Wednesday night on
Westwood One Radio Networks.
   Mellencamp is asking the public to write to the Commission on
Chicago Landmarks, urging it give the building permanent landmark
status.
   ``All the songs that were done here were what you cut your teeth
on as kids,'' Mellencamp said in a written statement from his

<HEAD>Navy To Cut Equivalent of One Aircraft Carrier by Reducing Airwings</HEAD>

   The Bush administration is planning to change
the mix of airplanes and helicopters assigned to aircraft carriers,
resulting in a Navy-wide loss of one full carrier's worth of
aircraft, according to a congressional study.
   ``Although the Bush administration is nominally planning to fill
out and support the same number of carrier airwings as the Reagan
administration _ 13 active and two reserve airwings _ the Bush
administration's total numerical requirement for carrier-capable
aircraft represents the equivalent of one less airwing,'' said the
study by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of
Congress.
   Rep. George Hochbrueckner, D-N.Y., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee, requested the study as part of his efforts to
save the F-14D jet fighter, which was cut from the 1990 budget by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Hochbrueckner released the study
Sunday evening.
   ``The Navy's new airwing structure doesn't solve the severe
problem of aircraft shortfalls _ it tries to cover them up,''
Hochbrueckner said. ``While I am all for moving to a standardized
airwing, I believe this sudden move by the Navy is a defense of the
Bush-Cheney budget rather than a defense of the national interest.''
   Hochbrueckner and Long Island's four other congressmen have been
fighting to restore some $360 million to the 1990 budget for 12 new
F-14Ds. The F-14D Tomcat is manufactured by Grumman Corp. in
Bethpage, N.Y., which has said it faces cutting 5,600 jobs if
funding for the jet is not restored.
   Ronald O'Rourke, CRS's naval analyst who prepared the study,
said he learned in the course of his research that the Navy is
planning to switch in the 1990s from a combination of aircraft
carrier configurations to a standardized ``transitional'' airwing.
   The result would be a reduction of 126 to 128 aircraft, or the
number required to fill out and support an active Roosevelt or
conventional airwing, O'Rourke said.
   No Navy spokesman would be available to discuss airwings until
Tuesday, the Navy press office said Friday.
   At the end of fiscal 1988, the Navy operated a combination of
Roosevelt, conventional, Kennedy and Midway airwings. Roosevelt and
Conventional airwings carry 86 craft apiece; the experimental
Kennedy and Midway airwings carry 76 and 66 aircraft, respectively.
At the end of fiscal '88, the Navy and naval reserves had 10
conventional airwings; two Kennedys, two Midways and one Roosevelt.
   Switching to transitional airwings would require 10 fewer F-14s
than in 1988, a reduction of 2.1 percent, the study found.

   A suspect in the kidnapping of former
Prime Minister Paul Vanden Boeynants has been arrested in Brazil,
police announced Sunday.
   Patrick Haemers, 36, who escaped from prison two years ago, was
arrested with his wife and an alleged accomplice in a suburb of Rio
de Janeiro, and Belgium has said it will ask that he be extradited
for questioning.
   Haemers was arrested at the request of Belgian officials who
also want to question him about other crimes during the past two
years, said a police official who asked not to be named.
   Vanden Boeynants, a 69-year-old Christian Democrat, was
kidnapped near his home Jan. 14 and was held in a darkened room in
Le Touquet, France, before he was released Feb. 13 after an
undisclosed ransom was paid.
   Le Touquet residents have said they recognized Haemers as one of
the men who rented the house where Vanden Boeynants was held.
   Vanden Boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again,
in 1978. He also was defense minister for seven years during the
1970s.

   In carefully cryptic terms, the
traveling White House is heralding a conciliatory message from
President Bush to counter Soviet offers and perhaps defuse NATO
differences on tactical nuclear weapons.
   Bush flew from Rome to Brussels on Sunday for the 40th
anniversary NATO summit beginning Monday, and his spokesman said it
would be th forum for a number of U.S. proposals, many of which
``have not been presented before.''
   The proposals apparently will involve some reduction in U.S.
forces in Europe, on terms yet to be disclosed. In addition, there
are likely to be economic gestures toward Moscow, involving a
relaxation of restrictions on high-technology exports.
   According to White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, troop
levels will be one of the issues on the Bush agenda at the meeting
with the leaders of 15 other NATO nations.
   Bush himself was silent on the subject, dismissing questions
about a report that he plans a 10 percent U.S. troop reduction, as
he conferred with Italian leaders and met with Pope John Paul II in
Rome.
   At advance Memorial Day observances on Sunday at an American
cemetery in Nettuno, Italy, near the World War II landing zone at
Anzio, Bush spoke of the generations who have grown in peace and
prosperity since that war.
   ``With no experience of the horror and reduction of war, it may
be difficult for them to understand why we need to keep a strong
military deterrent to prevent war and to preserve freedom and
democracy,'' the president said. ``The answer is here, among the
quiet of these graves.''
   That insistence on deterrence, despite Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's arms reduction offers, is another of the topics
awaiting Bush at NATO.
   West Germany has been pressing for immediate talks on
short-range nuclear missiles, most of them deployed on German soil,
with ranges of 300 miles and down, meaning that they also would be
used on German soil if it came to that.
   The Bush administration doesn't want those talks now, wary that
the Soviet Union would seek to preempt the negotiations with an
immediate proposal to eliminate all short-range nuclear weapons.
The administration sees those weapons as an essential deterrent,
offsetting Soviet superiority in conventional arms.
   The administration tried without success to settle that
disagreement prior to Buh's journey to Europe and the summit.
Nevertheless, the administration does not see the difference as a
crisis, or an issue likely to overshadow the summit.
   The troop question would be a compelling issue, too. Pressure on
that topic is not just international; there are growing demands in
Congress for a greater sharing of defense burdens by European
allies.
   Some reduction in U.S. forces is guaranteed _ at least 4,000
under budget decisions already made, and almost certainly more in
manpower assigned to intermediate-range nuclear missiles, which are
to be eliminated under a 1987 treaty with the Soviet Union.
   According to Pentagon testimony, that will eliminate the jobs of
about 14,500 U.S. personnel in Europe over the next 16 months. The
armed forces want to keep most of those personnel in Europe, on
other assignments, but there are demands in Congress to bring them
home.
   Amid all of that, the administration has indicated that some
troop reduction may already have occurred routinely _ from the
limit of 325,000 to the perhaps 305,000 estimated by an
administration official. The official, who declined to be
identified, said manpower levels fluctuate constantly.
   But a swing like that _ if it lasted _ would carry more than
routine significance.

   The new Congress of People's Deputies, President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's ``school for democracy,'' is balancing in
its first days on a thin edge between anarchy and old-style
political manipulation.
   In three exhausting days played out in the Kremlin, the 2,250
deputies:
   _Alternately inflamed and bored colleagues with a flood of
speeches more often touching on lofty principles or elementary
procedure than politics;
   _Refused to include many top reformers in the new full-time
legislature, entrusting its duties to deputies selected by local
delegations in a hazy manner;
   _Forced Gorbachev to answer sharp questions from little-known
deputies about his privileges and policies, and to delay election
of his candidate for vice president.
   Gorbachev has called the congress _ his concept for
strengthening the Soviet government and making it more democratic _
a ``school of democracy'' for a nation accustomed to heavy-handed
Kremlin control.
   A few years ago, deputies could have been jailed for saying some
of the things they pronounced openly in debate. Many of the
statements have taken the tone of a self-cleansing after years of
forced silence.
   Gorbachev reacted with patience and humor. He asserted his
desire to be elected president before giving a policy speech but
addressed touchy issues, like his government-provided country house
and his holding of both the party and government leadership.
   Reformist historian Yuri Afanasiev said Gorbachev was either
``attentively listening to the majority or skillfully manipulating
it.''
   Before the Congress took a break late Saturday to resume its
work Monday morning, Gorbachev sought to reassure it that its
disputes were normal.
   ``One need not panic,'' he said. ``It is all right when passions
are stirring.''
   The passion flared most sharply when reformers lost out in
elections for the 542-member Supreme Soviet legislature.
   Self-styled progressives from Moscow proved inept in a battle of
tactics, which Lenin taught the Communist Party to value above
nearly all else.
   Muscovites, alloted 29 seats on the Supreme Soviet, nevertheless
put forward a list of 55 candidates for those seats.
   They said it was a matter of principle that the Congress should
have a choice. But reformer Sergei Stankevich acknowledged, ``If
the list is longer than the quota, it is possible to lose some
people.''
   That proved to be an understatement. The Congress used its
choice to cull the reformers, among them Boris N. Yeltsin, who won
89 percent of the vote in March in popular elections for the
Congress of People's Deputies but didn't make the cut for the
Supreme Soviet.
   Stankevich himself received only 806 votes from the 2,250-member
congress.
   Reformers from the Baltic republics, more accustomed to
parliamentary give-and-take, threatened to boycott the elections if
choices were forced on them and engineered the election of
progressive slates by putting forward only as many candidates as
they had allotted seats.
   The delegation from Russia was the only one of 15 republics that
offered a choice of candidates for the new legislature's Soviet of
Nationalities chamber.
   Moscow candidate Alexander Kraiko said reformers woke up too
late to what was going on in the Russian delegation, which was
allotted 11 seats.
   ``We did not notice that there were 12 people, that there were
more people than our quota, and it was clear that if our quota was
exceeded, he would not be elected,'' he said.
   Rules and structure during the congressional session were poorly
worked out, and the meeting languished for hours as deputies
repeated each other or made proposals that everyone ignored.
   It lost its entire second day debating how to conduct elections
for the Supreme Soviet.
   Gorbachev at one point declared that a ``crisis'' had developed
because of an impasse over competitive balloting. He then called a
recess and ignored the issue when the session resumed.

<HEAD>Corrosion To Blame For Landing Gear Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corrosion caused metal fatigue that led to the
collapse of the left main landing gear on a Delta Air Lines 727 jet
while it was being towed away from an airport gate last week, a
federal investigator concluded.
   Arnold Scott, a Denver investigator with the National
Transportation Safety Board, blamed the collapse on fatigue in a
corroded trunnion assembly on the plane. Trunnions are the main
struts that attach landing gear to airplanes.
   ``And so when the tug pulled the plane forward an inch or two,
that was all she needed and it collapsed right there,'' Scott said
Friday.
   There were 113 passengers and seven crew members on board the
flight when the landing gear collapsed at Stapleton International
Airport. No injuries were reported.
   Scott said the corrosion could not have been seen without taking
apart the landing gear.
   Trunnions are scheduled for regular tear-down inspections. The
one that failed Wednesday was scheduled for inspection in August
1990 and had never been taken off the 8-year-old plane, Scott said.
   Following the incident, Delta made plans to inspect its entire
fleet of 727s. Other airlines will be notified of the problem,
Scott said.

<HEAD>At Wayside Inns, You Can Take It With You, For A Price</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Guests at the Wayside Inn can walk away
with a lot more than ashtrays and towels _ for a price.
   The rooms in Wayside of Virginia's six hotels have been
decorated with antique furniture and art objects, about 90 percent
of which are for sale.
   ``We've sold beds,'' said Judy Brown, historical curator of
Wayside Properties. ``Beds are the big thing people want to take
with them.''
   Prices of the antiques vary. A small print costs about $50, a
full-size walnut bed is priced at about $2,000 and a painting of
George Washington sells for $45,000.
   Rooms in the Wayside Inn in Middletown, which has been in use
continously as an inn since 1797, are decorated mostly in the
Colonial style. But the Lincoln Room has a portrait of Abraham
Lincoln and an 1860s Lincoln rocker, so-called because Lincoln had
one like it in the White House. The wallpaper pattern in the
Lincoln Room matches one used at Monticello, Thomas Jefferson's
home near Charlottesville.
   ``People are having a lot of fun with this,'' Ms. Brown said.
``My idea was to do something so out of the ordinary you wouldn't
have anything like it at home.
   ``People are tickled. We had a preservation group on Wednesday.
They were thrilled to death.''
   Wayside owns the Hotel Strasburg and two other inns in
Strasburg, about five miles south of Middletown in the northern
Shenandoah Valley. The company also owns the Battletown Inn in
Berryville and Larrick's Tavern in Middletown.
   The inns have had few problems with theft and breakage, Ms.
Brown said.
   ``If you're going to do it like a Holiday Inn, that's what
you're going to have. If you're going to have the ambiance, you
can't worry about it.''
   The project linking the inns and antiques grew from a 1985 fire
that gutted the Middeltown inn.
   ``Nobody really knew how the inn originally was until the
fire,'' Ms. Brown said. ``It kind of offered us an opportunity to
put it back.''
   Ms. Brown began replacing the antiques and reproductions in the
rooms and developing each room with its own theme.
   The inns, owned by antique collector Leo M. Bernstein, have long
had an unofficial policy of selling furnishings. Starting in May,
the practice became official with catalogued lists and set prices.
   Colors throughout the inns are bright, but their authenticity
can be documented, Ms. Brown said. ``People thought the Colonials
were very very bland,'' she said. ``They were not. They loved
bright colors, elaborate fabrics. It was a sign of wealth.''
   ``People like to know when they come to a place like this they
are living in history,'' Ms. Brown said. ``But they don't have to
go to an outhouse.''

   Just out of the shower, one sailor clad
only in a towel came face-to-face Sunday with his
commander-in-chief and the First Lady.
   The embarrassed seaman wound up as about the only man aboard the
helicopter carrier Guadalcanal who didn't seek a presidential
handshake.
   The less-than-regulation dress encounter testified to the
spontaneity of President Bush's surprise visit to the Navy ship,
anchored 2{ miles offshore in the Mediterranean Sea.
   It was set up with about 10 minutes notice, an extra Memorial
Day weekend stop after Bush's solemn speech and wreath-laying at
the World War II American cemetery in Nettuno, near the Anzio
allied landing zone. Nearly 8,000 U.S. war dead are buried beneath
white crosses there.
   Bush was due to return to Rome after the ceremony, but he had
his Marine One helicopter head out to the Guadalcanal instead.
   John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said it was
arranged on the spur of the moment when the president decided he
wanted to do it.
   ``Surprise visit, Captain,'' Bush said as he returned the salute
of Capt. John McKay of Virginia Beach, Va., commodore of the task
force that includes the helicopter ship. ``We only have about 10
minutes. I wanted to drop in and show the flag.''
   McKay got enough advance word to make it back to the ship from
the memorial ceremony. A Secret Service helicopter took him in. But
there wasn't helicopter room for the ship's own skipper; he was
left behind in Nettuno.
   There was a small honor guard of sailors in dress whites, lined
up for the president's arrival. Work crews on deck duty cheered
him. Most of the 1,800 sailors and Marines on the Guadalcanal were
below decks, so McKay poured coffee in his cabin while they
assembled on deck.
   Bush declined McKay's suggestion that he address the crew on
closed circuit television. He wanted to shake as many hands as he
could.
   ``We may not have time for any of this, but this is what I
wanted to do,'' he told the captain.
   Meanwhile, sailors were racing across the flight deck to get
into position for a glimpse of the president. Bush made a hurried
handshaking tour, lined up about 80 crew men for a photograph, then
waved, thumbs up, and shouted ``Keep it up.''
   After less than 20 minutes, the president and his wife were back
on their helicopter, lifting off for Rome.

<HEAD>Census Hangs Out Help Wanted Sign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Census Bureau has hung out an early ``Help
Wanted'' sign knowing that staffing up for the count that begins in
11 months won't be easy because the temporary jobs don't pay much
and most of the people who used to take them are working full-time
now.
   ``We will need to hire about 480,000 persons during the period
October 1989 to September 1990, with about 315,000 actually working
at the peak of operations,'' said Charles D. Jones, associate
director of the Census Bureau.
   In some areas there simply will not be enough people, while in
others the agency may be forced to hire those who are only
minimally qualified because there won't be enough applicants to
offer a choice.
   ``As long as the economy is good and the unemployment rate is
low we will face a big problem in hiring the number of people that
we need,'' explained Census spokesman Ray Bancroft.
   In 1790 it took just 650 people to count the nation's 3.9
million residents. Assistant U.S. marshals did the job.
   But the rapidly escalating population required ever more workers
as the decades passed: 3,231 enumerators in 1850; 52,871 in 1900
and 142,962 by 1950.
   This proved a major source of political patronage to the party
in power in the early years, but civil service rules eventually
came into play for many jobs.
   Housewives later became an important factor in this job force,
being eager for the extra income from part-time work. That's
changed now, with the majority of wives now working outside the
home, they are no longer available for census jobs.
   Indeed, in 1980 the problem became so severe that during peak
operations as many as 30 percent of enumerator jobs were unfilled
and many offices suffered from high turnover rates.
   Eventually, Census officials had to go back to the old-style
political referral system in that year, asking local officials to
suggest people for the jobs. That won't happen in 1990, the Census
Bureau says _ political recruiting is out.
   Yet in 1990, even though the majority of households will fill
out their census form and mail them in, officials expect to need as
many as 200,000 enumerators to visit the 30 million homes that
don't respond by mail.
   The remaining workers needed for the count will fill temporary
office jobs tabulating, running computers and managing local and
district offices.
   During preparation of the address lists for the 1990 count, some
28 percent of local offices reported problems in hiring sufficient
staff. Turnover rates reached 60 percent in some areas, double what
had been expected, according to a report from the General
Accounting Office.
   As a result, Census officials increased their recruitment
efforts and have moved to change their pay system from a uniform
$6-per-hour rate to one based on local needs, paying up to
$8-per-hour where necessary to be competitive with other employers.
   In addition, Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, proposed solving a
part of the hiring problem by hiring retired federal and postal
workers and military officers around the nation.
   He has proposed legislation that would permit these retirees to
accept Census jobs, on a temporary basis, without having their
retirement benefits reduced as required by current law.
   As many as 1.5 million to 2 million people may be covered by
this change, which drew wide support at a hearing called by Sawyer.
   Retired federal workers are accustomed to working within a
bureaucracy, are already trained in many of the skills that will be
needed and often are familiar with local geography and residents,
noted Judith Park of the National Association of retired Federal
Employees.
   In addition, the Bureau is working with state employment
services offices in every state to get referrals, and is also
seeking help from local governments and minority organizations.
   Workers will need to pass a written test and must be United
States citizens to work for the bureau. They should be at least 18
years old, although the bureau says that it can hire people as
young as 16 if they have a high school diploma.

<HEAD>For Prosecutors, Wood Slaying is Unforgettable Crime</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a crime that could not be allowed to
go unsolved _ a federal judge assassinated on orders from a family
so rich in drug money it tried to buy its own brand of justice.
   Ten years ago, a single rifle bullet struck U.S. District Judge
John Wood in the back outside his home, just days before he was to
preside over the drug conspiracy trial of Jimmy Chagra.
   Wood, known as ``Maximum John'' for the sentences he gave in
drug cases, was the first federal judge to be killed this century.
   ``The slaying was a traumatic occasion for an awful lot of
people,'' said Jamie Boyd, a former federal prosecutor who worked
on the Wood case and is now a Bexar County prosecutor. ``It was an
attack on the system, not just a judge, and it was a crime that had
to be solved.''
   Prosecutors suspected Jimmy Chagra, and the FBI began
meticulously putting its case together.
   By the time of the first indictments in April 1982, the FBI had
conducted more than 30,000 interviews, collected more than 500,000
pieces of information and spent nearly $5 million. Trials and
appeals pushed the tab to more than $11 million.
   In 1983, Chagra was acquitted of murder and conspiracy to commit
murder. But he later pleaded guilty in the attempt on the life of
another official and is serving a life term. Because he helped
prosecutors with an unrelated case, Chagra has disappeared into the
anonymity of the Federal Witness Protection Program, though he
remains in prison somewhere.
   Chagra's wife and a man convicted of taking the Chagras'
$250,000 to kill Wood also are in prison.
   Joe Chagra _ a now-disbarred lawyer who advised his brother to
have Wood killed _ was released on parole last year and is working
as a paralegal in El Paso.
   Jimmy Chagra was an El Paso rug salesman who turned to the
lucrative marijuana smuggling trade in the 1960s. By the time of
Wood's slaying, prosecutors say, his drug empire stretched from
Florida to Las Vegas.
   He was known as a high roller who reportedly once paid off a
casino debt of more than $900,000 in cash, and lost a $580,000 golf
match.
   Prosecutors say his generosity attracted con men _ among them
Charles Harrelson, who had served time on a 1968 murder-for-hire
conviction.
   Harrelson _ father of ``Cheers'' TV star Woody Harrelson _ said
he went to Las Vegas to dupe Jimmy out of $250,000. Prosecutors say
he was a coldblooded trigger man.
   ``Jimmy felt he was above the system and that's why he had no
compulsion for buying Harrelson's murder of Judge Wood, because as
he accumulated so much wealth he believed he was bigger than our
entire judicial system,'' said Jack Lawn, administrator of the Drug
Enforcement Administration. He was an FBI agent in San Antonio when
Wood was killed.
   With Joe Chagra's testimony _ given in exchange for a plea
bargain _ a jury was able to convict Elizabeth Chagra and Harrelson
and his wife.
   Harrelson was convicted of murder and conspiracy and sentenced
to two consecutive life terms, plus five years in prison for
obstructing justice. He has steadfastly denied any involvement in
the Wood killing.
   His wife at the time, Jo Ann Starr Harrelson, was convicted of
perjury and obstructing justice and is serving 25 years in prison.
Prosecutors say she bought the murder weapon.
   Mrs. Chagra was convicted of conspiracy, tax fraud and
obstruction of justice and sentenced to 40 years in prison.
   Joe Chagra refused to testify against his brother.
   But at the same time Jimmy Chagra was acquitted of murder in
Wood's death, he was convicted of possession of marijuana and
obstruction of justice. And he later pleaded guilty to
masterminding a plot to kill an assistant U.S. attorney, who
escaped a barrage of bullets just six months before and six blocks
from where Wood was killed. He was sentenced to life for the
attempt on the prosecutor.
   Joe, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy in the judge's death,
spent nearly 6 years in federal prison before being paroled in
March 1988.

   Rescue workers dug through flattened
buildings and searched for 150 fishermen missing after a cyclone
swept through Bangladesh and India, killing 60 people and leaving
half a million homeless.
   At least 27 people died and 2,000 were injured nationwide in the
storm, Relief Ministry officials said in Dhaka on condition of
anonymity. In India, 33 people died and 500,000 were homeless,
government officials said.
   The storm smashed into the Indian coast Friday night with winds
up to 85 mph. On Saturday it veered northeast into Bangladesh
through the Bay of Bengal, sweeping through marshy coastal areas,
then continued inland.
   Heavy rains continued Sunday, though winds had died down.
   The worst-hit area was Tangail, 45 miles northwest of Dhaka.
There, a roaring tornado swept away more than 2,000 flimsy houses,
burying 10 people, toppling trees and downing electricity poles,
Dhaka officials said.
   Five were killed in neighboring Gopalpur and the remaining
deaths were in western districts, including Manikganj, where a
tornado killed 1,100 people one month ago, they said.
   The relief officials said 150 fishermen, mostly in small boats,
were missing in the Khulna area along the Bay of Bengal.
   In West Bengal, India, 19 people were killed and about 10,000
mud-and-straw houses collapsed in the cyclone, the state Finance
Ministry said in a statement Sunday.
   Other deaths occurred in Orissa state, a desperately poor
region, where 450,000 were left homeless, state-run television
reported.
   Trains, water and electricity services were disrupted along the
Indian Ocean coast.
   The government issued storm warnings a week ago after detecting
a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal.
   Besides last month's deadly tornado, in November, a cyclone hit
Bangladesh, killing more than 1,000 people. Last summer,
four-fifths of the country was submerged in moonsoon flooding that
killed 1,400 people.
   But a three-month drought this year has withered the wheat and
rice fields that feed the 110 million people.

   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on Sunday insisted that West Germany stick to its demand
for superpower talks on reducing short-range nuclear weapons.
   Genscher's Free Democratic Party, meanwhile, passed a resolution
emphatically stating that NATO cannot exclude the possibility of
eliminating short-range nuclear arsenals.
   The Free Democrats have made thinly veiled threats to leave
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government if he accepts
unsatisfactory compromises on those weapons at the NATO summit that
begins Monday in Brussels.
   Kohl is demanding early negotiations on reducing short-range
nuclear arsenals, but the United States says talks must not be held
until the Warsaw Pact eliminates its superiority in conventional
forces.
   The United States also wants a clear signal from Kohl that he
opposes complete elimination of short-range nuclear weapons and
wants West Germany's support for NATO's plans to modernize the
missile fleet.
   Kohl on Sunday welcomed a disarmament initiative President Bush
plans to announce at the NATO summit, a radio station reported.
   American news reports have said Bush plans to propose the
withdrawal of about 30,000 U.S. troops from Europe as an important
NATO reply to disarmament initiatives launched by the Warsaw Pct.
   Hessischer Rundfunk radio reported Kohl as saying Bush's
proposal marks an ``important step forward.''
   A Sunday newspaper, Welt am Sonntag, said government officials
welcome Bush's plans but also see them as a means of putting
pressure on the West Germans to soften their opposition to
short-range nuclear weapons.
   At a Free Democrats convention in Cologne on Sunday, Genscher
restated West Germany's insistence that talks begin soon on
short-range nuclear weapons.
   ``Disarmament cnnot exclude any category of weapons,'' Genscher
said to loud applause from the 400 delegates.
   ``Why fear disarmament negotiations when they would create more
security and certainly not less in Europe?'' Genscher said.
   The foreign minister said West Germany is committed to NATO and
to Western defense efforts.
   But he added, ``Just as defense capability is necessary for a
lasting peace in Europe, so is cooperation, dialogue and
disarmament.''
   Just before Genscher's speech, the Free Democrats passed a
resolution reaffirming a hard line on the short-range nuclear
arsenals.
   According to the resolution, ``the elimination of all land-based
nuclear short-range rockets and nuclear artillery ... cannot be
excluded ... if this is permitted by an improved security situation
in Europe.''
   Most short-range missiles are based in West Germany and their
targets are in East Germany. Kohl, bowing to public pressure, faces
an election next year and has been pushing hard for talks on
reducing the missiles.
   U.S. officials warn they would not be able to keep American
troops in Europe without the protection of the missiles.

<HEAD>West Germans Wary Over NATO Nuclear Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   West Germany is becoming increasingly
wary of a NATO defense policy that could unleash nuclear weapons on
German soil despite this front-line nation's strident protests.
   The issue goes to the heart of a current dispute within the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization over whether superpower talks
should be held to reduce short-range nuclear weapons.
   The arsenals are deployed on German territory and would be fired
there in the event of war.
   West Germany is pressing for early superpower negotiations on
the missiles. The Unites States and Britain oppose such talks until
Soviet conventional superiority is reduced.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government is also resisting
a joint U.S.-British effort to replace NATO's aging short-range
missile arsenal in the 1990s with modernized rockets more than
triple the current range.
   The missile dispute is also at the core of a growing debate over
just how much say West Germany has in NATO decisions that could
literally affect its existence.
   That debate was fueled after recent leaks about a top-secret
NATO exercise allegedly designed to test an Alliance scenerio for
using nuclear weapons in Europe to stop a Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
attack.
   According to NATO strategy, the short-range weapons are a vital
part of a defense known as ``flexible response,'' or the threat
that NATO could use nuclear weapons along with conventional forces
to stop a Soviet attack.
   The leftist-leaning news magazine Der Spiegel, quoting anonymous
sources, said the exercise, dubbed Wintex 89, demonstrated the
potential powerlessness of non-nuclear NATO powers in preventing
the use of the weapons.
   The magazine said the West German and Turkish participants in
the exercise pulled out after NATO officials, led by U.S. officers,
ordered a theoretical atomic strike that would have destroyed large
parts of West and East Germany, Turkey and the western territories
of Poland and Czechoslovakia.
   Der Spiegel charged that the goal of the exercise was to limit a
nuclear exchange to Central and Eastern Europe, while buying time
to negotiate an end to the conflict before a full-scale nuclear war
erupted between the superpowers.
   ``West Germany is expected to commit suicide as part of the
plan,'' Der Spiegel wrote.
   NATO and West German officials refused to comment on details of
the exercise, but confirmed that it took place in a bunker outside
Bonn in late February and early March.
   Manfred Woerner, NATO's general secretary, said it ``was a
purely procedural exercise with innumerable artificial premises and
not an operational scenerio for waging war.''
   Spiegel said that under NATO guidelines, the decision to use
nuclear weapons hinges on top-level alliance approval and the
go-a-head by the U.S. president.
   Alliance partners are later consulted as ``time and situation
permits,'' the magazine said.
   West German fears are aggravated by a tangle of Allied treaties
and post-war agreements that remain in effect more than four
decades after the collapse of Nazi Germany.
   While a 1959 treaty stipulates that West Germany cannot be
forced to accept the stationing of new nuclear weapons on its
territory, earlier treaties remain in effect that allow the Allies
_ the United States, Britain and France _ to routinely replace
outmoded weapons.
   Liberals and leftists charge that West Germany could be forced
to accept new nuclear weapons over its objections.
   The West German government, however, insists that it has the
right to veto the deployment of new nuclear weapons on its soil.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Hanns Schumacher says, ``There is
simply no doubt that West Germany must first agree to accept new
nuclear weapons before they are deployed.''
   ``Even if a group of lawyers gets together and says that Germany
can be legally forced to accept them, it would really be a
politically unrealistic position for the United States or NATO to
take,'' he added.

<HEAD>Waterbed Salesman Uses Reel of String to Tie Thieves to Scene of
Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHREVEPORT, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Frustrated that thieves had broken into
his waterbed store 20 times without getting caught, Tom Showalter
tied them to the scene of the crime _ literally _ and took their
pictures.
   He did it with the reel of nylon string which he usually ties to
arrows so he can track down deer he hits when he goes bow-hunting.
Instead, he tied the string to items in his store.
   ``I figured ... if it works good for deer and it's good enough
for tracking through the woods and swamps, then it was good enough
to use here,'' said Showalter, owner of a store called The Bedroom
_ Your Waterbed Supermarket.
   He said thieves would take stolen bedding out and sell it,
adding, ``They've broken about $3,000 worth of windows to steal
$300 worth of bedding which they sold for about $30.''
   A robbery May 22 was the final straw.
   Showalter set up two video cameras, tied string from his game
tracker to several comforters and began spending the night in his
store.
   Early Saturday thieves broke in and apparently didn't notice
that they were being taped and their booty had strings attached.
   When they drove away from the store, the line followed.
   ``That reel was going 40 miles an hour,'' Showalter said.
``There was only about 10 yards left on the reel when it stopped.''
   Police Lt. D. Morgan said Sunday that the thieves apparently
drove to the end of the block, turned right, drove two blocks,
turned right again and parked.
   Investigators followed the string to the end of the block and
around the first corner, he said.
   ``The string broke in that two-block stretch ...,'' he said.
``They were able to pick it up again. ... They found a car with
some string hanging out of it that matched.''
   Police said they believe they know who was photographed on the
videotape but have not made arrests as of Sunday morning.
   Showalter said he hopes the incident will persuade others to
stop targeting his business.

<HEAD>Doctors Say Khomeini Suffered `Heart Discomfort'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors who operated on Iran's Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini said Sunday he suffered ``discomfort in his
heart,'' which was treated and relieved, Tehran television reported.
   Earlier reports said Khomeini had been operated on to stop
bleeding in his digestive system.
   Sunday's broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, gave no more details
of Khomeini's ailment but said all his bodily functions were normal
and that the spiritual leader was in satisfactory condition and
spending time with relatives.
   In a statement after Tuesday's operation, Khomeini's personal
physician said Khomeini was in excellent condition and was in fact
``an exception of history.''
   Khomeini has been reported ailing since he suffered a heart
attack in 1986. Since then, he has rarely been seen outside his
house in Tehran's Jamaran suburb.
   The recent operation has stirred old confusion about how old the
white-bearded revolutionary patriarch is.
   Much of the confusion stems from a variety of birth dates cited
for Khomeini and from the difference between the length of the
years observed by Moslems and by the West's Gregorian calendar.
   Reliable accounts in the past listed Khomeini's birth date, in
Western terms, as May 17, 1900. That would make him 89.
   But Khomeini's brother, Pasandideh, told the radical Pasdar-e
Islam magazine that the revolutionary leader was born, according to
the Moslem calendar, on Jamadi al-Sani 20, Hegira 1320.
   Moslem scholars calculate that this date translates to Sept. 23,
1902, which would make Khomeini 86 by Western standards.
   After Tuesday's surgery, the chief surgeon, Dr. Hassan Arefi,
also put Khomeini's age at 86.

   The Turkish government, despite its ties to
the West as a member of the NATO alliance, rejected a direct
American request to inspect an advanced MiG-29 jet fighter flown to
Turkey a week ago by a defector, administration officials say.
   The rebuff ``caused a lot of resentment'' among officials at the
Pentagon and State Department because the fighter was returned to
the Russians without the type of comprehensive inspection that
would shed light on Soviet capabilities, said the officials, who
asked not to be named.
   President Bush, in Brussels for a NATO summit, scheduled an
early morning meeting Monday with Turkish Prime Minister Turgut
Ozal prior to the start of the 16-nation NATO meeting, White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   ``This was a Russian front-line MiG-29, not the export version
of this plane,'' explained one administration source.
   ``We've examined export versions, but the Soviets don't share
their top technology on the stuff they export. This was a chance to
really get a look at the engines, `look-down' radar and other
systems that are loaded only on the Soviet air force planes.''
   The sources said Turkey never offered an adequate explanation
for its refusal to allow American experts to study the plane, but
U.S. officials assume the Turks were trying to avoid antagonizing
the neighboring Soviets even though Turkey is a member of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   In Ankara, Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu
reiterated Sunday what he had said at a news conference last
Wednesday. ``This is an affair completely between Turkey and the
Soviet Union,'' he said.
   Batu added that ``I have no knowledge of any U.S. request for
permission to inspect the Soviet plane.'' He did not elaborate.
   According to the administration sources, the U.S. government was
not informed of the defection _ even though the pilot has asked for
asylum in the United States _ ``until after the Turks had already
assured the Russians they could have their plane back.''
   Even at that point, however, the American embassy in Ankara and
some senior government officials in Washington ``strongly and
directly pressed the Turks to give us a little time to look at this
plane,'' said one official.
   ``The embassy informed them we could get a team there to the
scene without delay, But the Turks said `No,' they would have their
own experts take a look at it.''
   Capt. Alexander Zuyev fled the Soviet Union on May 20, flying to
the Turkish town of Trabzon on the Black Sea with a bleeding arm
wound.
   Pravda, the newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party, later
reported that Zuyev was working as a duty dispatcher at the
Tskhakaya airfield north of Batumi and therefore was armed on the
day of his flight. It said he shot and wounded a sentry, who fired
back and wounded Zuyev.
   Two other Soviet fighters started chasing the MiG-29 but could
not intercept Zuyev because the border was so near, Pravda said.
   The MiG-29, which carries the NATO codename of Fulcrum, is
considered the most modern and capable jet fighter currently in the
Soviet inventory.
   The plane can fly at 2.3 times the speed of sound and according
to U.S. intelligence agencies, carries ``a true
look-down-shoot-down radar, enabling it to engage low-flying
aircraft or cruise missiles.''
   Turkey allowed Zuyev's plane to be flown back to the Soviet
Union on May 21. It was stripped of rockets and weapons, which were
returned on a separate plane.
   Two days after the defection, Turkish newspapers reported the
MiG had been examined by both Turkish and American military experts
before its return. One day later, on May 23, Turkish officials said
the plane had been inspected by U.S.-trained officials ``who knew
what to look for'' and that their findings would be shared with the
NATO allies.
   ``Look, we had a real opportunity here and the Turks shafted the
alliance,'' said one administration source. ``It's not just the
U.S. that's mad. Our pilots aren't the only ones who might have to
fight this plane one day.''
   The sources added that they were still assuming the Turks would
make good on the pledge to share information gleaned from their
inspection, ``but we're not expecting much.''

   Joe Clark, the bat-wielding high school
principal portrayed in the movie ``Lean on Me,'' was in
satisfactory condition Sunday after surgery to replace a heart
valve, hospital officials said.
   Clark, 52, was recovering in Beth Israel Hospital's cardiac care
unit after the four-hour operation, said hospital spokesman Tom
Casey.
   Clark was admitted to the hospital Wednesday with a high fever.
   The surgery was necessary to remove bacteria infecting Clark's
heart valve, thus preventing the infection from spreading to other
organs, said his cardiologist, Dr. Sharlene Watts.
   One of Clark's aortic valves was replaced with an artificial
one, Casey said. He did not know how long Clark would have to stay
in the hospital.
   Clark gained fame last year through his bat-and-bullhorn method
of discipline at Eastside High in Paterson, a troubled inner-city
high school.

   Tens of thousands of protesters swarmed through a
stadium parking lot on Sunday to protest the defeat of prominent
reformers seeking seats in a new Soviet legislature.
   Demostrators shouted ``Shame!'' when a speaker mentioned
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who made the Soviet political
process more open but who was partially blamed for the defeat of
several reform candidates.
   The protest, which had official approval, came after results
were announced Sunday of balloting for the 542-seat Supreme Soviet,
a newly created standing legislature.
   The members of the full-time legislature were picked by the
Congress of People's Deputies from among its 2,250 members.
   Among the candidates defeated was Boris N. Yeltsin, a popular
reformer and former Moscow Communist Party chief.
   Rally organizer Vitaly Ponomarev claimed more than 100,000
people filled the lot and called the protest ``the biggest
political meeting ever in Moscow.'' The nightly news put the crowd
at 70,000.
   Ponomarev accused Gorbachev of siding with party bureaucrats
rather than average Soviets.
   ``Your behavior at the Congress is the most shameful act of your
political biography,'' he said before he was interrupted by loud
chants of ``Shame!''
   ``You have to decide who you are for, the bureaucracy or the
people. You can't sit on two chairs,'' he said.
   Yeltsin did not attend the rally, but his image was represented
on a slew of signs and buttons.
   ``Moscow workers and intelligentsia! They spat in your face _
Yeltsin wasn't elected!'' read one sign.
   The assemblage ``voted'' with a show of hands to ask another
deputy to give up his Supreme Soviet seat so Yeltsin could serve,
and to notify the congress by telegram that ``By not choosing
Yeltsin, the congress ignored the will of 5.6 million Muscovites''
who initially elected Yeltsin to the congress by a landslide during
March elections.
   The television news program ``Vremya'' quoted a public opinion
poll that said 49 percent of the population was dissatisfied with
how elections to the Supreme Soviet were run. Asked if the majority
at the congress is always right, 62 percent said no.
   Vremya also broadcast a brief account Sunday night of the
protest.
   Historian Yuri Afanasiev, who made a blistering speech Friday
criticizing the congress for being ``aggressively obedient'' and
suggesting Gorbachev could be manipulating it, told the crowd not
to despair.
   ``If the whole country actively expresses its will like this, we
can't help to feel it in the Palace of Congresses in the Kremlin,''
he said, referring to the building where the congress has been
meeting.
   Congressional deputies from the 15 republics nominated
candidates to represent their specific regions in the Supreme
Soviet, and the congress as a whole _ which is dominated by
Communist Party members _ made the final choices for each region.
   Most of the regional delegations chose one candidate for each
seat they were allotted. But the Moscow contingent, dominated by
reformers, picked 55 candidates for its 29 allotted seats in the
spirit of multi-candidate elections.
   That backfired, however, when the most prominent and popular
reformers were snubbed by a majority of the congressional
membership.

<HEAD>France Says Nuclear Force Built Without U.S. Help</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France acknowledged Sunday it exchanged information
on nuclear weapons with the United States, but it denied the
country received help building its nuclear arsenal.
   In a statement, the Defense Ministry said any sharing did not
compromise the independence of the French nuclear force.
   The statement was issued in response to an article published
Saturday in the U.S. quarterly, Foreign Policy, which revealed the
secret briefings on design and safety aspects of nuclear weapons.
   The Defense Ministry acknowledged the two countries exchanged
technical information ``mainly in the domain of safety,'' and ``to
the benefit of both parties.''
   ``It did not lead to any transfer of concepts or formulas. It is
with its own means that France builds an independent nuclear
deterrent,'' the statement said.
   The Defense Ministry refused to elaborate on the statement.
   The article by Princeton University professor Richard H. Ullman
said that starting in 1972, U.S. experts briefed the French on
numerous aspects of nuclear weaponry, including penetration of
Soviet defenses.
   The U.S. Defense Department acknowledged it supplied France with
information but a spokesman declined to provide details.

<HEAD>Panama's Archbishop Condemns Paramilitary Violence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The archbishop of Panama on Sunday
condemned violence by paramilitary groups that ``seem to operate
with official approval'' and demanded the release of political
prisoners and an end to torture.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath, in his strongest criticism of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega's regime, told about 12,000 people gathered
for an outdoor Mass that the Roman Catholic Church had to speak out
while ``the national life is in suspension.''
   Thousands of supporters of opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara interrupted the homily with applause, and at the
end thousands waved white handkerchiefs and sang Panama's national
anthem.
   International observers have said Endara's ticket won Panama's
May 7 presidential race by a 3-to-1 margin, but the vote was
annulled on May 10 by the Noriega-controlled government.
   Endara and vice presidential candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon
and Guillermo Ford stood quietly in the crowd until the end, when
they were surrounded by shouting supporters as they left the muddy
field where the nationally televised Mass took place.
   ``We're with the archbishop 100 percent,'' said Endara. ``He
said exactly what the people think, and he touched the heart of
Panama.''
   McGrath rejected criticism that the church might be politicizing
itself or taking sides in a political battle.
   The church must speak for ``all men, for truth, for justice, for
fraternity. The church ... must support these values and point out
the obstacles in their way.''
   McGrath said concern for people who ``hunger for God, bread,
justice and fraternity'' led the Panamanian bishops' conference to
release a pastoral letter two weeks ago condemning the beatings of
opposition candidates and the nullification of elections.
   He condemned torture and ``anarchic violence by those who have
been called paramilitaries even though they sometimes appear to
operate with official approval.''
   He called on the government and the military to allow political
prisoners or those in exile to return to their families ``as a step
toward the reconciliation of the Panamanian family.''
   The reference to the military was an acknowledgement that the
Panamanian Defense Forces, commanded by Noriega, hold the balance
of political power in Panama.
   After the elections were annulled, the Organization of American
States passed a resolution condemning Noriega and calling for a
transfer of power as soon as possible.
   However, an OAS delegation sent to promote a solution to
Panama's problems only succeeded in exposing the political impasse
last week and failed to bring about talks between the opposition
and Noriega.
   The Mass was nationally televised in a program that featured
rare close-ups of opposition candidates and scenes of their
supporters waving white handkerchiefs and singing.
   One of the most enthusiastic demonstrations came when the
media-wise crowd spotted an American television crew on a platform.
Thousands waved and chanted fervently for Endara, who was inside
thanking the archbishop for his statements.

   A Jewish settler had his
hand blown off Sunday when he picked up a booby-trapped Israeli
flag on which a swastika was painted. Arab reports said Jewish
settlers beat up five Palestinians in reprisal.
   Also Sunday, Palestinian guerrillas fired rockets at the
northern Israeli city of Metullah from Lebanon, the first such
attack in a year. An 8-month-old boy suffered a cut on the neck
from flying glass after one of the rockets exploded outside his
house. No other damage was reported.
   The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the
Palestine Liberation Front, two radical PLO factions, claimed
responsibility.
   Reacting to the claim, Foreign Ministry Spokesman Alon Liel
said: ``While many countries around the world still believe that
the PLO has put an end to its terrorist activites, two factions of
the terrorist organization openly compete for the responsibility of
injuring an Israeli baby.''
   In another development, a Palestinian teenager died of a head
wound he suffered in a clash with troops a week and a half ago,
Arab hospital officials said. They identified him as Emad Abdelafu
Zughgair, 18, from Hebron.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers shot and wounded 16
Palestinians in clashes with stone-throwing youths in four refugee
camps and in Gaza City, Arab reports said. The army confirmed two
wounded and said it was checking the other reports.
   Tensions mounted between the army and settlers over vigilante
attacks, and members of Parliament's Foreign Affairs and Security
Committee engaged in shouting matches with Jewish settlers who
accuse the army of not protecting Israelis in the occupied
territories.
   Twenty-two Israelis have died since December 1987, when
Palestinians began their uprising against Israeli occupation of the
West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Palestinian death toll stands at 499.
   Benny Begin, a leading member of the right-wing Likud bloc and
the son of former Prime Minister Menachem Begin, told settlers
during the committee meeting, ``Blaming the army command and
officers are things that can bring us down.''
   The meeting was called off as tempers rose. As the commmittee
members left, settlers outside shouted, ``You protect the Arabs!
Why not protect us?''
   Earlier, a 26-year-old Israeli from the West Bank settlement of
Berakha spotted an Israeli flag painted with a Nazi swastika on a
road near the settlement. His hand was ripped off by an explosion
when he picked up the flag, said Yitzhak Hillel, another settler
from Berakha.
   Officials at Beilinson Hospital in Israel reported that doctors
were able to reattach the hand of the victim, identified as Simcha
Volker.
   Arab reports said six cars full of Jewish settlers beat up five
Arabs in and around the nearby village of Burin just after the 6:30
a.m. explosion.
   Three people were dragged from vehicles and attacked, and two
men were beaten in their homes, the reports said. The victims were
treated at Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, four miles away, hospital
officials said.
   Recently, there have been several attacks on Arabs by Jewish
settlers seeking revenge for stoning and firebomb assaults on
Israeli cars.
   Some settlers have hit soldiers who tried to prevent the revenge
attacks. Arabs have charged some soldiers also assisted the settler
revenge sprees, but the army denies the accusations.
   During a Cabinet meeting Sunday, the military chief of staff,
Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said vigilante attacks are interfering with
soldiers' ability to put down the uprising.
   Communications Minister Gad Yaacobi of the Labor Party called
for the arrest of settlers who attack Arabs.
   ``They cannot take the law into their own hands,'' he said on
Israel radio after the Cabinet session. ``It is an action against
the law.''
   An army spokesman said the West Bank military commander, Gen.
Amram Mitzna, appointed a special ombudsman to handle mounting
complaints from Palestinians about misconduct by soldiers and
settlers.

   A slow-moving freight train carrying
fruit from California slammed into about 30 parked railroad cars
early Sunday, killing the brakeman and the conductor and injuring
two other workers aboard.
   One of the parked rail cars was thrown into a 110-car coal train
traveling in the opposite direction on an adjacent track, but no
one aboard that train was injured, said Wayne Beighle of the state
Department of Public Safety.
   Beighle said it was remarkable that no one else was killed in
the accident, which occurred at about 2:10 a.m. The 35-car fruit
train was headed for Chicago at the time.
   ``Evidently, they thought the track was clear,'' Beighle said.
``That's still under investigation.''
   ``I've never seen an engine torn up like that before in my
life,'' he said. ``I've seen a lot of train crashes, but nothing
like this. It looked like the front three-quarters of that engine
were cut in half. I don't see how anyone lived.''
   Department of Public Safety investigators said they were told
the fruit-bearing train had slowed to 20 mph as it approached
Amarillo's train terminal.
   ``Apparently somebody saw what was coming up on the tracks, but
we don't know how soon before impact they applied the brakes,''
Bieghle said.
   ``I see the devastating damage at 20 mph, I can only imagine
what it would have been like at higher speeds,'' he added.
   Both trains involved were being operated by the Santa Fe
Railway, although the engines damaged in the accident were owned by
Burlington Northern.
   State investigators and Santa Fe officials interviewed witnesses
early Sunday as an investigation into the crash began. The National
Transportation Safety Board also will investigate.
   The two workers who were killed were identified as Steve R.
Favreau, 29, and Robert N. Dawson, 44. Favreau was the train's
brakeman and Dawson was the conductor.
   The train's engineer, identified only as R.H. Coleman, was
listed in critical condition Sunday at Northwest Texas Medical
Center in Amarillo. The other injured crew member, identified as
A.H. Zermeno, was in good condition at the same hospital.
   All were from the Amarillo area, authorities said.
   ``What was amazing to me was that another train was passing by
as this accident occurred,'' Bieghle said. ``The odds are
astronomical. There wasn't any time lapse.''
   He described the sequence of events this way: ``The first train
hits the parked cars. An empty one is knocked into the cab of the
other train, then back into the first engine again. That second hit
is what really did damage.''
   No one in the second train was even shaken up, officials said.
The coal train had been heading to Muleshoe, Texas.
   All of the parked railroad cars contained what Santa Fe
officials called a common, non-hazardous agricultural chemical,
Beighle said.

   President Bush praised his friend Peter Secchia on
Sunday and predicted the Senate will confirm the Michigan
businessman as ambassador to Italy.
   A hitch in the Senate confirmation process prevented Secchia
from taking the post and being here to greet Bush on his first trip
to Europe as president.
   But in remarks to the embassy staff at the U.S. ambassador's
residence, Bush called Secchia ``a good friend'' and assured them,
``He will do a good job.''
   ``He knows what he doesn't know,'' said the president.
   Secchia's fate was left in limbo when the Senate adjourned
earlier this month without confirmation.
   Senators have expressed reservations over Secchia's
qualifications and his use of abusive, sometimes profane language
in public.
   Bush, speaking from a platform in the garden of the Roman villa
where the U.S. envoy lives, said, ``I believe the Senate will
confirm him.''
   Secchia ``has big shoes to fill'' because of the ``remarkable
job'' done by out-going Ambassador Maxwell Rabb, who has served in
the post for the past eight years, the president said.
   Bush said the two-day Rome visit went ``remarkably well.''
   He and First Lady Barbara Bush posed for pictures with the
embassy staff children before departing for Brussels and the
two-day NATO summit.

<HEAD>Prosecutors To File Charges Against Palme Suspect</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A regional prosecutor said Sunday he is
filing charges against a Swede suspected in the 1986 slaying of
Prime Minister Olof Palme.
   Chief Prosecutor Anders Helin told national radio his case
against Christer Pettersson, 42, was based on the fact that the man
had been identified by several people at the murder site. He did
not elaborate.
   Palme was gunned down from behind on Feb. 28, 1986 while walking
home unguarded with his wife Lisbet from a downtown movie.
   Speaking of the indictment, Helin said: ``pieces are missing. We
do not, for instance, have the murder weapon and we do not have ...
technical evidence. That, of course, is a weakness.''
   The arrest of Pettersson last December gave an unexpected twist
to the massive investigation, which had focused on an international
conspiracy.
   The suspect is believed to have acted on his own. He has a long
criminal record, which includes a manslaughter conviction, and has
a history of mental illness. He has denied killing Palme.
   Helin declined to say how sure he was that Pettersson was the
right man, saying only ``the investigation has produced such
evidence that it was our duty to hand down an indictment.''
   He said observations provided by Mrs. Palme, who reportedly has
identified Pettersson as the killer, was an important factor in the
decision to file charges.
   The trial, to be held in a special security hall in Stockholm's
local courthouse, is scheduled to start June 5.
   It originally was set for May 29, but defense attorneys asked to
have it postponed, saying they had not finished reading the more
than 2,500-page investigation.

<HEAD>New York Cardinal Asks to See American Hostages</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS thruout to UPDATE with Moslems criticizing O'Connor, patriarch's

   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York
canceled a visit to Moslem west Beirut Sunday and instead appealed
to the captors of nine American hostages to ``let me see them.''
   ``Some of my countrymen are hostages here because they wanted to
help Lebanon,'' the Roman Catholic archbishop said.
   Several Moslem leaders reacted angrily to O'Connor's decision
not to go to west Beirut and said his views of Lebanon's years of
conflict would be incomplete.
   ``I wish that those who are holding the hostages would let me
see them because I would go anywhere that a priest can go,''
O'Connor said during a visit to an institute for war-wounded
victims in the Christian heartland northeast of Beirut.
   The cardinal traveled to the facility in Beit Shebab in a
bullet-proof black Cadillac escorted by four jeeps full of army
commandos.
   O'Connor came to Lebanon to refocus attention on the hostages,
whose plight has been overshadowed by civil war fighting. The
hostages are believed held in Moslem districts of the city by
extremist fundamentalist groups linked with Iran.
   O'Connor looked angry as he told reporters of the decision to
scrap meetings with Moslem government and religious leaders.
   ``We're not going to west Beirut at the moment for security
reasons. I am told this is not a good time for me to go,'' he said.
   Sources at Bkirki monastery, seat of Maronite Catholic Patriarch
Nasrallah Sfeir where O'Connor is a guest, said the cardinal
received a telephone call from the U.S. Embassy minutes before he
announced the trip cancellation.
   O'Connor, however, said the decision was made by Sfeir and
Luciano Angeloni, Pope John Paul II's representative in Lebanon.
   ``It's their considered opinon that this morning I should not go
to the west for security reasons. But this is not because of any
discussion with our ambassador, Mr. (John) McCarthy, or any
officials in the U.S. government,'' O'Connor said.
   ``Whether I will still go I just don't know,'' he added. ``I
still very much would like to go over and pay those courtesy calls.
But I am now subject to the recommendations of my host.''
   But Sfeir's aide, Bishop Roland Abu Jawdeh, told reporters the
patriarch had nothing to do with the cancellation of the visit.
   ``The only person who mentioned security was Ambassador
McCarthy, who also cancelled a lunch (Sunday) in the cardinal's
honor,'' Abu Jawdeh said.
   O'Connor had been scheduled to meet in west Beirut with acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in
Lebanon's dual government, and Shiite Moslem Parliament Speaker
Hussein Husseini.
   Hoss said, ``I regret to say there are those who have an
interest in preventing the cardinal from listening to our views.''
   He did not mention any names but said ``they portrayed the
security situation to him in an exaggerated manner to make him call
off the visit.''
   Husseini said O'Connor was ``fed misleading information to
prevent him from coming to west Beirut to get the Moslem views.''
   O'Connor overruled State Department objections in coming to
Lebanon for a three-day visit. He arrived Saturday.
   Aides said the archbishop was unaware of the Moslem criticism
when he celebrated an outdoor Mass at Virgin Mary's Church in the
town of Harisa.
   He told about 2,000 applauding Christians, ``My reason for being
here is ... I love you.''
   He drew cheers when he declared that the bishops in the United
States ``will not turn their backs on you, not as long as I'm alive.
   ``The Christians in Lebanon have never persecuted any other
people. They have always wanted to live in peace with Moslems and
others. The world does not understand this.''
   He added, ``I will fight for your freedom.''
   At least 15 foreigners, including nine Americans, are held
hostage in Lebanon. They include Anglican church envoy Terry Waite
of Britain, who disappeared in west Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while
on a mission to free the hostages. He turns 50 on Wednesday.
   The longest held hostage is American Terry Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was
kidnapped March 16, 1985.
   The latest fighting in Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war pits army
commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mostly Christian troops against
a Syrian-Druse alliance that outnumbers them 4-1.
   O'Connor held a 90-minute meeting Sunday with Aoun, who heads a
Christian Cabinet contesting power with Hoss.
   Syrian gunners in west Beirut blasted the coast of the Christian
enclave north of Bkirki with sporadic shellfire, maintaining a
blockade against the area's 1 million inhabitants. Police said
there were no casualties.
   At least 359 people have been killed and 1,396 wounded since the
fighting and Aoun declared on March 8 a ``war of liberation''
against the Syrian troops.
   Syria, under a peackeeping mandate from the Arab League, sent
troops into Lebanon in 1976.
   O'Connor voiced sympathy for Aoun's cause. ``You can't do
anything when you have occupying armies and when you have shells
coming in,'' he told reporters.

   Thunderstorms spread over the central Plains on Sunday, and an
unseasonable blast of cold air brought record lows to Michigan and
dropped snow on Montana.
   Showers and thunderstorms developed early Sunday ahead of a warm
front over the central Plains, and by afternoon extended across
much of southern and central Iowa, and northern and central
Missouri.
   A thunderstorm in southeastern South Dakota produced high wind
that downed trees and blew a truck off a road, the National Weather
Service said.
   The cold front advancing over the north-central part of the
nation spawned showers over northern Minnesota.
   In Michigan, Alpena had a record low of 31 degrees and Flint
tied its record of 36.
   It also produced snow over parts of north-central Montana. U.S.
2 at East Glacier Park was closed and 2 to 3 inches of slush was
reported on roads in the area of Cut Bank, east of the park.
   Showers were scattered across lower elevations of the Pacific
Northwest.
   A few showers and thunderstorms were scattered over Florida.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 32
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., to 96 at Laredo and Beeville, Texas.
Sunday's low for the 48 contiguous states was 26 degrees at Redmund
and Lakeview, Ore.
   For Monday, scattered showers and thunderstorms, developing
ahead of a cold front, were forecast from the northern high Plains
through the middle and upper Mississippi Valley to the Great Lakes
region. Widely scattered thunderstorms were forecast over Florida
and the southern Plains. Rain was forecast over the northern and
central Rockies.
   Highs in the upper 40s and 50s were predicted from the Great
Basin of Nevada and western Utah to the northern Rockies; in the
50s and 60s from the northern and central Pacific Coast to Upper
Michigan; above 80 from the desert Southwest across the middle and
upper Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast; and in the 90s from
southern Arizona to the lower half of the Mississippi Valley.

   In another move to suppress the demonstrations
demanding greater freedom, conservatives who have gained the upper
hand in China's power struggle have created a censorship committee,
sources said Sunday.
   One of the key demands of tens of thousands of students who have
occupied Beijing's central Tiananmen Square has been a free press.
   For several days during the rallies and marches, the closely
watched Chinese news media reported the events with a freedom
unprecedented in the 40 years of Communist Party rule.
   Thousands of journalists participated in some of the marches and
signed petitions calling for a free press.
   Diplomatic and government sources said Premier Li Peng and other
hardliners estalished a five-member group with broad powers to stop
the dissemination of information considered harmful to the
conservative cayse.
   They said the group was formed Tuesday following the imposition
of martial law on May 20. Since then the news media has been
dominated with reports supporting the crackdown.
   A liberal newspaper in Shanghai, the World Economic Herald, has
been stopped from printing its last two issues.
   In Beijing, security forces were posted at such major news
outlets as the People's Daily, the Xinhua News Agency and the
central radio and television stations.
   The sources said Li was furious last Monday when the People's
Daily, the Communist Party's newspaper, published a front-page
article saying martial law could not solve political problems.
   On the same day the paper published a photograph of hundreds of
people blocking what appeared to be a tear-gas equipped vehicle
from entering Beijing.
   The picture of a vehicle that could be used to scatter
demonstrators was significant because the government had said
martial law was not intended to suppress the student movement.
   The People's Daily printed a front-page story Sunday saying the
vehicle was a truck ``used to carry anti-aircraft weapons for the
air force.''
   Last week, Zhao Ziyang, Li's rival and the moderate head of the
Communist Party, reportedly was stripped of power for expressing
support of the student movement.
   The sources said Hu Qili, who belonged to Zhao's faction and was
the Politburo member in charge of superiving the media, also was
removed from positions of authority.
   They said the censorship committee will assume some of Hu's
functions. The sources said the five committee members, all known
for their conservative views, are Wang Renzhi, head of the party's
propaganda department; chief government spokesman Yuan Mu; He
Dongchang, vice minister of the education commission; Zeng Jianhui,
Xinhua's deputy president, and Ding Weijun, head of the Beijing
city information department.
   Yuan is the best known of the group. During the ultra-leftist
Cultural Revolution he was closely associated with the ``Gang of
Four,'' who ruled China during the movement's last years.
   But he survived the gang's purge, earning the nickname ``foxy,''
a reference to his ability to weather political changes.
   Some Chinese journalists said formation of the committee signals
a new ``winter'' for the media.
   ``For three days we were in the sun,'' said one. ``Now we are
waiting for a thunderstorm.''
   Reporters at leading media outlets said they are being told to
write ``reports'' detailing their activities during the movement.
The reports could be used later as evidence against them, they said.
   Still, they said no punishment will be able to wipe out the
successes of mid-May.
   On May 17-19, papers throughout China were filled with articles
on the student movement, some even urging the government to give in
to some of the student demands.
   ``Those days taught us that Chinese can report the truth,
something we thought only Westerners could do,'' said one reporter.
``We also realized that people will read newspapers if they are
truthful. Seeing my articles pasted on the walls of buildings all
over town was such an encouragement.''

<HEAD>Veterans Get Bronze Stars 45 Years Later</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   More than 150 military veterans were
awarded the Bronze Star in a Memorial Day weekend ceremony that
honored them _ 45 years after the fact _ for service during World
War II.
   ``Since we all got through it and we're still living, I am very
proud to be here today for this award,'' James Holland, 69, said
after he and his brothers David and Samuel received medals at
Saturday's ceremony.
   James Holland, an infantryman in the war, said he was awarded
the Purple Heart after being wounded near the Maginot Line in
France in late 1944. But he had never been given the Bronze Star.
   On Feb. 3, 1944, President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the
Bronze Star, ordinarily given only for heroic or meritorious
service in combat, for everyone serving in the military on or after
Dec. 1, 1941.
   Most of the 152 World War II veterans at Saturday's ceremony
were members of the 1943 graduating class of White County High
School who enlisted in the military on their graduation day.
   Lewis Teeple, who coordinated the awards program for American
Legion Post 99, said many had received early medical discharges and
their records had been misplaced before they could receive the
Bronze Star.
   Two years ago, he said, the Department of Defense discovered
that the men hadn't received their awards, Teeple said.
   ``This marked the first time so many Bronze Stars have been
given out at one time in Tennessee history,'' Teeple said.
   Six World War I veterans also received Republic of France
certificates in Saturday's ceremony, which was sponsored by
American Legion Post 99.

<HEAD>Israeli Troops Kill Two Guerrillas in Lebanon Shootout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli troops on Sunday killed two Palestinian
guerrillas in a shootout in southern Lebanon, an army spokesman
said. He said the guerrillas were on their way to attack a northern
Israeli settlement.
   Israel-backed Lebanese militiamen also wounded and captured two
gunmen in the shootout in Israel's self-declared ``security zone,''
the spokesman said.
   No Israeli troops or militiamen from the South Lebanon Army were
injured in the firefight, said the spokesman, who under regulations
cannot be named.
   Also Sunday, several Katyusha rockets were fired from Lebanon
into the Israeli border town of Metullah, slightly injuring an
8-month-old boy.
   In Beirut, the Marxist Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine and the Palestine Liberation Front of Talaat Yakoub
claimed responsibility for both attacks.
   The Lebanon clash began before dawn Sunday, as a joint Israeli
army and South Lebanon Army force spotted four armed men north of
the village of Khaim, two miles north of Metullah.
   ``The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) immediately opened fire,
killing two terrorists,'' the spokesman said.
   Israel established its security zone, a six-to-10 mile-wide
strip along the border, in 1985 after withdrawing most of its
troops from Lebanon.
   Foreign reports indicate Israel has almost 1,000 troops in the
zone, which also is atrolled by the South Lebanon Army.
   The army spokesman said the gunmen carried Soviet-made
Kalashnikov assault rifles, an RPG grenade launcher, two
American-made LAW anti-tank rockets, wirecutters and explosives.
   The spokesman said the explosives and wirecutters showed the
guerrillas intended to cross the Israeli border and carry out
attacks.
   ``A preliminary investigation established that the terrorists
intended to carry out an attack on a northern settlement to kill
Israelis,'' he said.
   An eyewitness said the guerrillas who were killed carried white
plastic bags filled with plastic explosives made in Iran and wore
red headbands. On the headbands were written Allahu Akbar (Arabic
for God is Great) as well as slogans in Farsi (Persian).
   The army spokesman said the military was investigating the
report.

<HEAD>Free Presbyterian Church Splits After Chancellor Suspended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A dissenting group has broken away
from the church that disciplined Britain's lord chancellor for
attending Roman Catholic Mass, one of its ministers said Sunday.
   The small Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland last week
rejected an appeal by Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Britain's chief
legal officer, against his suspension as an elder of the church.
   Mackay, 61, then announced he would leave the church rather than
accede to its demand he not attend Catholic funeral Mass, as he had
done twice in honor of fellow peers. The church regards the Roman
Catholic faith as a perversion of Christianity.
   On Sunday, the Rev. Angus Morrison said from his pulpit in
Edinburgh that a ``dissenting minority'' of the church had broken
away.
   Supporters of the breakaway movement formed the new Presbytery
of the Associated Presbyterian Churches in Inverness on Saturday.
   Morrison issued a statement saying: ``The synod, by a majority,
has made pronouncements and reached decisions which violate the
constitution of the church.
   ``In many cases these have been irregular and have denied the
rights of individual Christians. I and others find in conscience
that we cannot remain, and we have therefore separated from the
church.
   ``We constitute a dissenting minority claiming to adhere to the
doctrine and constitution of the church.''
   The statement ``reserved the right'' of ministers and elders to
exercise the functions of their offices for those church member who
join the new group.
   It said there would be ``implications for church property'' _
indicating the possibility of disputes over the control of church
assets.
   The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland claims a membership of
7,000, including overseas members, but the number of regular
worshipers in Scotland is thought to be about 3,000.
   Morrison would not estimate how many members the new group might
attract or say if Mackay might be among them.
   ``He (Mackay) isn't involved,'' the minister said. ``I don't
want to be seen to speculate on him and I think he needs a good
rest and a bit of peace and quiet after all this business.''

<HEAD>DOE Fusion Panel Cancels Visit To Utah Researchers' Lab</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Energy Department panel evaluating cold
fusion experiments canceled a visit to the University of Utah after
researcher B. Stanley Pons bristled at the committee's composition,
a newspaper said Sunday.
   Pons demanded that the panel be changed, either by dismissing
members he feels are hostile to his research or by adding friendly
ones, according to the Deseret News.
   ``I see this visit as a waste of valuable time, since many of
these panel members have already clearly stated their positions,''
Pons told the newspaper. ``I feel there is little one can say to a
hostile person that will change his mind.''
   Pons said he and co-researcher Martin Fleischmann, a British
colleague from the University of Southampton, think the panel was
``organized in a manner that can only lead to a negative and
non-objective report'' on fusion research.
   On March 23, Pons and Fleischmann announced they had achieved
room-temperature, or cold, fusion using rods of palladium inside
coils of electrically charged platinum immersed in heavy water.
Heavy water is water made with an isotope of hydrogen called
deuterium.
   Pons and Fleischmann said the energy generated by their
experiment was up to 100 times that needed to produce the reaction.
   Scores of laboratories have attempted to duplicated the
experiment, but few report similar results and proof of nuclear
fusion remains elusive. Pons and Fleischmann have been particularly
criticized by physicists, who contend the reaction may be a
chemical reaction, not fusion.
   A co-chairman of the 20-member Energy Department committee,
University of Rochester nuclear chemistry professor John Huizenga,
told the University of Utah on Friday that the panel's visit,
scheduled for Wednesday, was being canceled.
   In a telephone interview Sunday, Huizenga told The Associated
Press that the reasons for the cancellation were ``rather
complex,'' but acknowledged that Pons' concerns over the panel's
makeup were a factor.
   Huizenga said several committee members also had Memorial
Day-related commitments that conflicted with the trip.
   Whether the committee reschedules the visit depends on several
factors, including Pons and Fleischmann's concerns about its
composition, Huizenga said. He declined to give further details,
but said he would like to visit the university at some point.
   The committee has also planned visits to Stanford University and
Texas A&amp;M University, which have duplicated parts of the Utah
experiment.
   Pons said Saturday that the panel included several scientists
who have expressed disbelief at his fusion claims, and therefore do
not have the impartiality desired in such a review committee.
   ``It is disappointing that the committee is composed of so many
members who have previously stated their very negative position in
the press regarding this research,'' he said.
   He said the most notable of those were IBM fellow Richard
Garwin, Steve Koonin of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Mark Wrighton, head of the chemistry department of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
   Pons said he was disappointed that the committee, instead of
negotiating, cancelled the visit.
   He said he and Fleischmann would continue to only allow
``reputable, sincere scientific collaborators'' into their labs.
   Pons, a professor of chemistry, said he is even more convinced
that he and Fleischmann have tapped fusion.
   ``The newest results are very strong and indeed confirm and
surpass our earlier results,'' he said. ``These data and their
analysis will be published later this summer in scientific
literature.''

   The leaders of archrivals Greece and
Turkey, in Brussels for the NATO summit, held ``very fruitful''
talks Sunday that ended on a first-name basis.
   Turkey and Greece are members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and they have been trying to improve relations.
   Sunday's meeting of Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Ozal and Greek
Premier Andreas Papandreou was their fourth since January 1988.
   ``It was a very fruitful meeting,'' Ozal said. ``I started to
call him Andreas and he called me Turgut. We are having
increasingly friendly relations.''
   Ozal said he invited Papandreou to visit Turkey and the Greek
leader accepted, providing he wins in Greece's June 30 election.
   Papandreou and Ozal met for 65 minutes at a Belgian government
house on the eve of the NATO summit.
   ``The two prime ministers ... reaffirmed their firm attachment
to the agreements reached in Davos (Switzerland), Brussels and
Athens last year,'' said a statement released by the Turkish side.
   No joint communique was issued but Papandreou said that should
not be given a negative interpretation.
   He said he and Ozal agreed to resolve a problem related to
financing of NATO military installations in their countries _ an
issue that has been deadlocked for years.
   Papandreou said the two also discussed the situation on Cyprus,
and the Greek Cypriots' government had asked him to apeal to Ozal
to press Turkish Cypriots to reach an agreement.
   The Mediterranean Island has been divided into Greek-Cypriot and
Turkish-Cypriot zones since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded. The
Turks invaded after Greek-Cypriot national guard officers, seeking
to unite Cyprus with Greece, staged a short-lived coup.
   Turkey and Greece also have conflicting claims over continental
shelf rights in the Aegean Sea.
   Papandreou said that dispute will have to be settled by the
International Court of Justice in the Hague.

<TEXT>
   An ultra-rightist party said
Sunday it plans to expel one of its members for allegedly making
anti-Semitic remarks, and called for the man's resignation from the
Frankfurt city council.
   Legislator Erich Gutjahr of the National Party of Germany (NPD)
was quoted by the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper Friday as saying
``Jews are plundering us again'' and that something must be done
about it.
   The interview sparked a furor among other city legislators and
the city's Jewish community. The Frankfurt prosecutors' office said
it was investigating Gutjahr for possibly violating West German
laws.
   Gutjahr is vacationing in Switzerland and has been unavailable
to comment. But Winfried Krauss, a National Party spokesman, said
Sunday he spoke with Gutjahr, who told him the newspaper report
``was correct in its tenor.''
   Krauss said party officials decided Gutjahr should leave the
organization and quit his city council seat as well.
   Krauss also said the party ``distances itself'' from Gutjahr's
reported statements.
   The National Party of Germany, which has taken harsh stands
against permitting more refugees into West Germany, won seven city
council seats in local elections last March, giving it a minority
voice in the body.

<TEXT>
   A group of U.S. Navy veterans and former U-boat
crewmen spent the Memorial Day weekend remembering a part of
history they shared 45 years ago: the capture of the only German
submarine during World War II.
   They gathered Sunday to rededicate the newly renovated sub to
the Museum of Science and Industry, where it has been on display
for 35 years.
   ``They lost and we won, but we've become very good friends,''
retired Adm. Earl Trosino, who lead the boarding party during the
capture, told the crowd of about 150 veterans and their families.
   They honored those veterans on both sides who have died since
the war.
   ``Many of the men in this engagement, both American and German,
have been transferred to another realm by our supreme commander,
but we must remember them and honor them, for they will always be a
part of us,'' he said.
   The U-505 submarine was captured June 4, 1944, two days before
D-Day, off the coast of west Africa. The capture was significant
because it enabled the Allies to break the German radio code. The
sub had sunk eight Allied ships in the three previous years.
   The sub is one the most popular attractions at the museum on the
city's South Side. Tours cost $2.50 for adults and $2 for children
and senior citizens. Admission to the museum is free.
   Most of the group gathered for the Memorial Day weekend were
sailors assigned to the ships that surrounded the submarine as it
was towed to Bermuda. But two of the captured German sailors flew
in from Europe for the occasion, and a third, Hans Gobeler,
traveled from nearby Elkhart, Ind..
   Gobeler, 65, recalled with a thick accent the last day he served
as petty officer on board the submarine.
   ``We got chased a couple of days ... and that morning we were
feeling safe,'' he said. ``We heard the sonar noise, and went up
the periscope, and saw we were surrounded by a unit of U.S. Navy.''
   The U.S. ships dropped depth charges, and forced the craft to
surrender.
   ``After we got the depth charge, I saw the ship jumping up,'' he
said. ``I thought it would break,'' said Josef Kraus, who came to
the ceremony from his home in southern Bavaria. He was 19 when he
was the sub's helmsman.
   Kraus said he is happy to have become friends with the American
crewmen since the war ended.

<TEXT>
   Nearly 5,000 opposition supporters
marched Sunday through this town known nationwide for toughness,
kicking off the 1990 electoral campaign with the first united
opposition march.
   ``Democracy Yes, Sandinismo No,'' the crowd chanted as it snaked
through town for more than two hours.
   No uniformed police were in sight during the march, the largest
show of opposition to Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government
this year, and no violence was reported.
   ``Only with unity can we defeat the Sandinista regime,'' said
one of the speakers, Mauricio Diaz, head of the Popular Social
Christian Party.
   The sea of flags, posters and banners representing labor unions
and 15 opposition parties flowed through Monimbo, a neighborhood so
feisty that even the dreaded National Guard of ousted dictator
Anastio Somoza was afraid to enter.
   Masaya, 17 miles southeast of the capital of Managua, was
crucial to the popular revolution that finally replaced Somoza with
the leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front on July 19, 1979.
   ``Masaya was the tomb of Somocism, it will be the tomb of
Sandinism,'' people chanted.
   The united opposition, which spans the political spectrum from
left to right, took pains to distance itself from the
anti-government rebels known as the Contras.
   Azucena Ferrey, the only woman on the political directorate of
the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Resistance, the rebel leadership, gave
her speech after the rally was officially pronounced over.
Supporters of her Social Christian Party gathered separately from
the march.
   When Ms. Ferrey returned from exile Friday night, she signed a
document renouncing support of armed struggle against the
Nicaraguan government. She was the first member of the rebel
directorate to do so.
   All Nicaraguan exiles who return must sign the document.
   The general elections are scheduled for Feb. 25, 1990. They were
moved up 10 months by Presiident Daniel Ortega as part of an
agreement reached with the presidents of El Salvador, Honduras,
Guatemala and Costa Rica at a summit in El Salvador Feb. 14.
   Pledging free campaigns and balloting, Ortega promised electoral
and other reforms that have since been enacted by the
Sandinista-dominated National Assembly.
   The opposition claims the reforms are merely cosmetic and leave
the electoral process under Sandinista control. But Ortega said
last week the Sandinistas would make ``no more concessions'' to the
opposition.

   A retired NASA engineer who predicted
that the beginning of the end of the world would occur in 1988 now
says his forecast was off by one year.
   Edgar Whisenant said born-again Christians will be taken up into
heaven Sept. 1 in the ``rapture.''
   Whisenant, 56, created a stir last year with the publication of
``88 Reasons Why the Rapture Will Be in 1988.'' He estimated that
he and the World Bible Society here gave away or sold about 4.5
million copies of the booklet.
   ``The Final Shout-Rapture '89 Report'' is to be released this
week, said Whisenant, who co-wrote the booklet with Greg Brewer.
   ``I made a mistake last year. My calculations were off by one
year,'' Whisenant said in a telephone interview last week from his
Little Rock, Ark., home.
   The mistake occurred, he said, because present-day Gregorian
calendars count only 99 years for the first century; calculations
begin at 1 A.D., not zero.
   ``But I believe my mistake was God's will _ a shout, a
preparation period for the church. And there has been a revival. I
believe this year it's the rapture,'' he said. ``The evidence is
there.''
   Whisenant, who lives on his pension from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, said he has dedicated his
life to trying to unlock the Bible's riddles about the rapture.
   ``I've spent $50,000 of my own money to get the word out about
this,'' Whisenant said. ``I've never made a cent on it. I've put
152,000 miles on my VW and all I own is a bed. When you fear God
enough, you don't lie, cheat or steal.''
   In the new booklet, he said he ``is not a prophet, and such
studies are subject to error.''
   The World Bible Society, which had revenues of $3.1 million in
1987, made an estimated $200,000 on the controversial booklet, but
it was given to Christian charities, said society head Norvell
Olive.
   Olive said he plans to send out 300,000 free copies to
Protestant ministers nationwide before selling them for $2 a copy
in Christian bookstores.

   A teen-ager awaiting trial in the
shooting deaths of his parents was captured with a companion
Sunday, a day after they broke out of jail.
   The Washburn County sheriff's office said the fugitives were
still in jail uniforms and were shoeless when they surrendered
without resistance to policeman Don Esser in Spooner, about six
miles north of the jail.
   Todd A. York, 18, of rural Spooner and Keith Thompson, 17, of
Trego were discovered missing Saturday morning, said Sheriff Don
Fuller. They had used hacksaw blades to cut through the bars of a
jail window, Fuller said.
   York faces an Oct. 2 trial in Circuit Court on charges that he
murdered his parents last September after overhearing them talk
about enrolling him in a drug counseling program.
   The sheriff's office said Spooner police were notified someone
had seen two young men fitting the fugitives' descriptions. They
were found about 1:30 p.m. behind a bottling plant and were taken
to Burnett County Jail in Grantsburg.
   York was later transferred to Douglas County Jail in Superior.
   Fuller said law enforcement agencies throughout Wisconsin and in
neighboring states had been alerted to the jail break.
   ``All they had on was jail coveralls and small sandals _ almost
barefoot,'' the sheriff said.
   York and Thompson had been cellmates since May 13, when Thompson
was jailed on a burglary charge and for probation violation, Fuller
said.

   The 1865 explosion of the paddlewheeler
Sultana was a disaster to rival the sinking of the Titanic, and the
muddy Mississippi River coughed up burned and bloated bodies for
weeks afterward.
   But until Sunday, no memorial had been created in this onetime
Confederate stronghold for the Union soldiers who perished aboard
the steamship, many of them emaciated survivors of Confederate
prison camps during the Civil War.
   Before a small crowd of about 50 people, a 6-foot granite marker
was unveiled in Memphis' Elmwood Cemetery as a reminder that the
Sultana went down in flames just seven miles north of the city's
downtown riverfront.
   Built for 300 passengers and a crew of 76, the paddlewheeler was
carrying more than 2,300 people, in addition to 100 horses and
mules, when three of its four boilers exploded at 2 a.m. on April
27, 1865, less than three weeks after the end of the war.
   Most of the more than 1,500 people who died had recently been
freed from prison camps in Alabama and were headed north to be
released from the Army. Many were crowded onto two decks directly
over the paddlewheeler's 18-foot boilers, one of which had
developed a leak and been hastily repaired.
   When one of the boilers blew, setting off two others, the upper
decks collapsed, forming a funnel that dumped dozens of the victims
into the fire, said Hugh Berryman, a forensic pathologist at the
University of Tennessee in Memphis.
   Jerry Potter, a Memphis lawyer who has researched the disaster
for a dozen years and is writing a book on it, said Union officers
may have overloaded the paddlewheeler to inflate troop transport
payments.
   ``There were two other steamboats that were trying to get a
portion of the men. The only explanation I have been able to
uncover for why the Sultana got them all is bribery,'' Potter said.
   Potter and Berryman estimated the Sultana death toll at 1,547.
By comparison, 1,503 lives were lost when the ocean liner Titanic
hit an iceberg and sank in the remote North Atlantic in 1912.
   Other counts of the Sultana victims have put the total between
1,400 and 1,450, but Berryman said those estimates failed to
include one of three trainloads of soldiers who boarded the boat at
Vicksburg, Miss.
   ``Our figure is probably a conservative one,'' Berryman said.
   The Sultana monument, financed by three Memphis residents, will
be the second of two major markers to the disaster.
   The other, in Knoxville, Tenn., was put up in 1916 by Sultana
survivors who raised money for the monument themselves.
   Researching the disaster has been difficult because newspapers
of the day were still primarily concerned with the assassination of
Abraham Lincoln two weeks earlier and with the end of the war,
Berryman said.
   ``It was just lost to history because of the other events that
were going on at the time,'' Berryman said.

   A student activist group early Monday urged
students over loudspeakers to maintain their occupation of
Tiananmen Square until June 20, when China's legislature is set to
discuss the democracy movement.
   The announcement came a day after about 80,000 students from
throughout China marched in Beijing to recharge their campaign for
a freer society with less corruption.
   They also demanded the fall of conservative Premier Li Peng, who
declared martial law in the city May 20 to suppress the movement.
   ``We cannot leave the square,'' student loudspeakers blared.
``If the People's Liberation Army suppresses us we will become an
exemplary model for all future movements to come.''
   The announcers, who said they were from a leadership group,
claimed 30,000 students from Beijing remained on the increasingly
dirty, foul-smelling square. The numbers were inflated.
   The announcement further confused the question of who is leading
the student movement.
   Activists from Beijing proposed Saturday that the occupation end
Tuesday and that the students concentrate on propaganda work,
informing the masses of the movement's goals. Thousands of students
are returning to their home provinces daily to spread the word.
   But many of the largely out-of-town students remaining in the
square say they will refuse to go.
   Students from most of China's 31 provinces paraded through the
narrow streets of the capital's old quarters Sunday.
   ``We'll keep coming until Li Peng steps down,'' the marchers
chanted.
   ``Li Peng is a big political thug,'' said a student from coastal
Shandong province.
   Also Sunday, sources said government hardliners formed a
censorship group to assert more control of the increasingly
independent state-run media, which have been largely sympathetic to
student demands.
   Another 30,000 students marched against Li in Shanghai, with one
banner depicting the premier as a cockroach with a military cap.
Thousands of Chinese also marched in Taiwan, Hong Kong and Sydney,
Australia, to show solidarity.
   Unlike demonstrations last week that drew up to 1 million
people, there were few non-students in the Beijing march.
``Factories are now taking economic measures against workers who
participate,'' one student leader said.
   But large crowds of residents continued to applaud protesters
and to gather around university gates, reading student posters and
listening to student broadcasts.
   Hardliners led by Li, who is believed to be acting for senior
leader Deng Xiaoping, reportedly have placed moderate Communist
Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang under house arrest and removed
him from his post.
   Zhao had expressed sympathy for the students, whose demands
included talks with the government on a freer society and an end to
corruption and profiteering by officials.
   Martial law was declared in response to the student occupation
of Tiananmen Square, which entered its 16th day Sunday. About
10,000 students remain in the 100-acre square, down from a peak of
about 200,000.
   Beijing activists have proposed that the occupation end Tuesday
and that the students concentrate on informing the masses of the
movement's goals. Thousands of students are returning to their home
provinces daily.
   But many of the students they will stay, at least until June 20,
when China's legislature is expected to meet.
   ``We will not leave ... We haven't achieved our goals,'' said
Yao Gangfu, a sophomore at Jiangsu Chemical Engineering Institute.
   People's Liberation Army troops were rushed to the outskirts of
Beijing to enforce martial law but were prevented from entering the
city by throngs of residents. Soldiers have retreated to nearby
camps and roads have cleared.
   One Western analyst said about 200,000 troops have been sent to
Beijing, but he believes such large numbers were called in as part
of the leadership power struggle, not merely to suppress students.
   Official media continued to report support for the martial law
decree, with nationwide television saying the country's largest
union was behind the move, even though many of its members marched
with the students.
   In another step to end the protest, the party Central Committee
and the State Council ``fully affirmed (the students') patriotic
enthusiasm and will not investigate and punish those students who
have voiced and committed extremist words and acts,'' the state-run
Xinhua News Agency reported.
   A party Central Committee meeting is expected to be convened
soon to approve the reported purge of Zhao.
   Sources said the conservatives still may be determining what
accusations to make publicly against the party leader.
   A document circulated among high-level party members accuses
Zhao of forming an anti-party coalition and using the student
movement to seize power, one diplomatic source said.
   But another document distributed to lower-level officials is
less harsh, saying Zhao betrayed the party and revolution, helped
incite the demonstrations and tried to split the army, the source
said.
   Defense Minister Qin Jiwei, party propaganda chief Hu Qili, and
Vice Premier Tian Jiyun are believed included in a purge, the scope
of which remains unclear.
   Many analysts feel that after Zhao's purge, Li Peng may be next
to fall because of his unpopularity.

   Thousands of police raided two
universities Sunday to stop teachers from organizing a union in
defiance of the law and officials reported 1,081 teachers and
students were arrested.
   A force of about 4,500 riot police surrounded Hanyang University
where teachers were meeting to organize their first union in South
Korea, according to police. They said some 700 officers moved in to
the university and arrested about 250 teachers.
   Hundreds of teachers barred from entering Hanyang University
then gathered at Yonsei University to hold a rally and when police
went there they were barred by students who formed human barricades.
   Police officials said most of the teachers at the Yonsei rally
were arrested along with some students.
   The officials said virtually all of the detainees were released
after signing statements that they would not join or support the
planned union but five people remained under arrest.
   Police did not say how many of those arrested were teachers and
how many were students.
   The government has banned teachers' unions on grounds that
teachers as civil servants cannot form trade unions.
   The National Council of Teachers, which claims a membership of
70,000, sought to organize a union.
   There are about 300,000 primary, middle and high school teachers
in South Korea.

   President Bush arrived Sunday for the
16-nation NATO summit prepared to respond to Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's arms reduction proposals, as the Western alliance
seeks common ground in the changing landscape of East-West
relations.
   The two-day summit that begins Monday marks the 40th anniversary
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but a dispute over the
alliance's own short-range nuclear missiles threatened to undermine
the unity celebrations.
   Still, NATO officials said they would not let the missile
dispute overshadow what they described as the real task of the
summit leaders _ planning their strategy to deal with the enormous
changes under way in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   ``NATO is at once ready to assure a common defense and to reduce
arms,'' Bush said as he set the tone for his meeting with allied
leaders. Possible U.S. initiatives included proposals to reduce
U.S. troop strength in Europe and drop a ban on high-technology
exports to the Soviet Union.
   The New York Times reported in Monday's editions that Bush, in a
confidential letter to other western leaders late last week, had
proposed that NATO offer a cut of about 30,000 American troops in
Europe as part of a plan to reduce non-nuclear forces.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Sunday evening
that some of the allies had been briefed on the substance of the
U.S. proposals, but he declined to provide details of the
initiatives.
   Bush said on his arrival in Belgium, home of NATO headquarters,
that he looked forward to the time the Soviet Union will be
welcomed as a ``constructive partner,'' but he also stressed the
need to maintain NATO defenses and the security of Europe.
   The United States remained at loggerheads with West Germany over
Bonn's demand for early superpower talks to reduce short-range
nuclear weapons. The United States says those weapons will remain
essential until the Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional
forces is reduced.
   But West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher insisted
Sunday at a German political rally that ``Disarmament cannot
exclude any kind of weapons.''
   A spokesman for Margaret Thatcher, who arrived here Sunday
night, said the British prime minister ``cannot contemplate''
negotiations to reduce short-range nuclear missiles ``unless and
until conventional force reductions have been agreed and they're
being tangibly implemented.''
   The British spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
it was possible no deal would be reached at the summit. ``We aren't
in the business of a bad agreement. We are in the business of
retaining flexible defense,'' he said.
   Bush flew to Brussels from Italy, where he closed out a two-day
visit with an emotional Memorial Day weekend tribute to Americans
slain in a 1944 assault on fascist Italy.
   At the U.S. military cemetery in Nettuno, which holds the
remains of nearly 8,000 soldiers, Bush said their deaths
demonstrated ``why we need to keep a strong military deterrent to
prevent war and to preserve freedom and democracy.''
   Bush highlighted the story of war hero Sylvester Antolak, a
young soldier from Ohio who won the Medal of Honor for
single-handedly capturing an enemy machine-gun nest despite being
hit three times by gunfire. Antolak, who is buried in Nettuno, knew
``the cost of maintaining freedom,'' Bush said.
   Earlier, some two dozen right-wing demonstrators had delayed the
presidential motorcade for about three minutes, hurling a blizzard
of flyers questioning whether the U.S. troops in World War II were
liberators or invaders. A handful were arrested.
   Bush was greeted at Brussels National Airport by Belgian Prime
Minister Wilfried Martens.
   ``We want to see an end to the division of Europe,'' the
president said, but he also called on the East to adopt ``Western
values'' as a way of bringing the two sides closer together.
   Martens called for ``seizing the opportunities to improve the
conditions of peace while taking care not to jeopardize security.''
   White House officials, declining to be identified, said whatever
actions Bush might take on the 305,000 to 324,000 troops in Western
Europe would be framed as a NATO proposal in East-West arms
reduction talks in Vienna.
   ``Whatever he proposes will be done in the context of submitting
suggestions for alliance consideration,'' Secretary of State James
Baker said Sunday.
   The New York Times report said Bush's proposal to NATO leaders
would mean a 10 percent overall U.S. troop cut, including a 20
percent cut in U.S. Army and Air Force combat troops in Europe. The
president's plan would require the Soviet Union to cut more of its
troops in Eastern Europe than Moscow has proposed thus far, the
Times said.
   The paper said Bush also proposed that the West accept the
Soviet contention that aircraft in Europe be part of a conventional
arms pact. Bush suggested an acceleration of efforts to negotiate a
treaty and expressed hope an agreement would be reached within a
year and implemented by 1992 or 1993, the Times said.
   Baker and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also acknowledged West
Germany's interest in reducing the NATO short-range nuclear weapons
on its soil, but they said the United States is in no hurry to
pursue talks with the Soviets on that issue.
   In an NBC-TV interview from Rome, Baker said ``the president has
already acknowledged at least the principle of negotiations,
although he feels very, very strongly that before you can talk
about that or get into that, you need to see a conventional forces
agreement'' with the Warsaw Pact.
   But Genscher on Sunday threatened that his Free Democratic Party
would withdraw from West Germany's coalition government if
Chancellor Helmut Kohl adopted the American stance. Facing such
political pressure at home, Kohl warned on Saturday against delay
in addressing the missile issue.
   Fitzwater said Sunday that ``The situation is unchanged. We
continue to discuss it.''
   White House officials, meanwhile, indicated Bush is now ready to
have NATO negotiate directly with the Warsaw Pact on troop levels.
   The comprehensive Western arms reduction proposal tabled in
Vienna in March called for indirect manpower cuts through
withdrawal of equipment and consequently the troops needed to
operate it.
   Gorbachev this month offered a 1.26 million cutback in Warsaw
Pact troops as part of an overall reduction in forces to reach
equal ceilings of 1.35 million for the two alliances.
   An American initiative to reduce troops might blunt disarmament
tendencies within NATO and allow the Western leaders to paper over
the missile issue with an ambiguous communique at the windup of the
Brussels summit on Tuesday.
   Pressure has been building on Bush since Gorbachev announced
late last year that the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and
50,000 troops from Central and Eastern Europe and cut Soviet forces
by 500,000 overall.

<HEAD>Bob Hope Drive Gets Freeway Signs on Comedian's 86th Birthday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Never far from the limelight, comedian
Bob Hope intends to celebrate his 86th birthday near the traffic
lights Monday.
   Hope planned to stand on the side of a freeway on Memorial Day
decked out in a hard hat and fluorescent orange vest to unveil a
sign that points the way to Bob Hope Drive.
   Hope will unveil the sign with California State Assemblyman Pat
Nolan and Jerry Baxter, the director of the California Department
of Transportation, Hope's publicist Ward Grant said.
   Bob Hope Drive was originally dedicated last May, but the signs
could not be in place until this Memorial Day, coincidentally the
comedian's birthday.
   Later in the day, Hope planned to celebrate in a more
traditional way with his wife Delores in their Toluca Lake home.
   Last week, 3,000 people sang ``Happy Birthday'' to Hope on the
flight deck of the aircraft carrier Yorktown, in Mount Pleasant,
S.C.
   ``Age doesn't mean a damn thing,'' Hope said at the celebration.
``When I wake up in the morning, I don't feel my age _ in fact I
don't feel anything till noon ... then it's time for my nap.''

   Hundreds of thousands of people marched through
central Hong Kong Sunday to show support for the Chinese students
in Beijing demanding more democracy and changes in the Communist
government and party.
   It was believed to be the largest demonstration ever held in
this British colony with a population of 5.7 million.
   Organizers estimated the number of marchers at 1.5 million.
Police placed the figure at around 500,000.
   Parents with babies, students, housewives, elderly citizens and
merchants joined in the six-mile march in response to a call by the
Beijing students for demonstrations throughout the world to back
their demands for democratic reforms.
   Chanting ``Long live democracy!'' and ``Support Beijing
students!'' the throngs began the march in the Central District,
walked to North Point and then started back to the Central
District, ending the rally at Victoria Park.
   Marchers filled half of the roads along the route and vans,
buses and cars in the remaining lanes were adorned with posters
backing the marchers and the drivers honked the horns.
   Waiters at a restaurant displayed a sign saying ``Keep Up the
Good Work!''
   ``We live in Hong Kong. We are used to freedom but the students
in Beijing have to fight for it. We have to help them,'' said So
Kwok-poon, a jewelry merchant.
   Hong Kong is scheduled to be returned to China in 1997. China's
Communist authorities have promised to preserve Hong Kong's
capitalist system for 50 years under a ``one country, two system''
concept.
   When the first group of marchers finished the hike two hours
after setting out hundreds of thousands of people were still
waiting at the starting point to begin. The march began at 2 p.m.
and ended about eight hours later.
   Choi Yan Sau-mei said she and her three children waited for four
hours before they could join the huge procession. ``It is a big
time. I want the kids to know what is happening in China. We cannot
go to Beijing so we only use our money and voice to support,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Four Teen-Agers Killed In Boat Accident</HEAD>
<DATELINE>INDIAN ROCKS BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four teen-agers aboard a 14-foot
motorboat were killed when a 38-foot racing boat rammed them on the
Intracoastal Waterway, authorities said Sunday.
   A witness to Saturday's accident said the larger boat
accelerated as it cleared the Indian Rocks Beach Bridge, hit the
side of the 14-foot boat carrying five people, then continued on
over the top of it.
   ``It sounded like plastic breaking _ a lot of it,'' said bridge
tender A.J. Couturier.
   Pronounced dead at the scene were Jeffrey Nash, 19, and Jan
Christman, in her late teens, both of Clearwater, said Indian Rocks
police Sgt. J.T. Gannon.
   Initially reported as missing were Rick Weeks, 19, and Todd
Kuhn, 19, both from the Clearwater area. Divers from the Florida
Marine Patrol searched through the night and recovered both bodies
Sunday, said FMP Investigator Dan Sievers.
   A 17-year-old male passenger, James LeCher of Clearwater, was in
serious but stable condition at Bayfront Medical Center in St.
Petersburg on Sunday after surgery for internal injuries.
   The five passengers on the racing boat were not injured.
   The driver of that boat, William LaTorre, his wife, son and two
friends of the boy were taken to Largo Medical Center for
counseling, said Brenda Smith, a Medic One spokeswoman.
   Nathan Galliher, a boater who saw the accident, said LaTorre's
racing boat passed him south of the bridge at about 20 mph.
   ``Just after the boat passed under the bridge, he just gunned
the engines,'' Galliher said. ``He let it rip. He was cranking.''
   Couturier, the bridge tender, said LaTorre's boat ``created
quite a wake'' when it speeded up after passing under the bridge.
The smaller craft tried to maneuver out of the way but couldn't,
Galliher said.
   Evidence collected from the crash site, along with results of a
blood-alcohol test given to LaTorre, will be handed over to the
State Attorney's Office, authorities said.
   No charges have been filed yet in the accident.

   Thousands of Chinese students burned effigies of Chinese leaders
Li Peng and Deng Xiaoping in Chicago and marched in New York on
Sunday in continuing shows of support for their pro-Democracy
colleagues back home.
   ``We wish to boost their morale,'' said Tony Tam, a 31-year-old
native of Hong Kong and a student at the University of Chicago.
   In Lansing, Mich., about 400 Chinese and Chinese-American
students attending Michigan colleges marched on the state Capitol.
   ``We want to show our support for our fellow students in China.
Even though they (the Chinese leaders) have won this time, we will
win the battle,'' said Hong Zhang of Sichuan, China, a graduate
student at Michigan State University.
   The U.S. protests came as about 80,000 students marched in
Beijing to recharge the pro-Democracy movement, which is threatened
by a government power struggle that has left hardliners in charge.
Recent reports indicate that students may end their two-week
occupation of Tiananmen Square.
   About 1,500 people, most of them Chinese students, demonstrated
in Chicago and about 1,200 marched to the Chinese Consulate in New
York. The United States is host to about 40,000 students from
China, and similar demonstrations have erupted in cities and
universities around the country.
   In Chicago, the students gathered near the Chinese Consulate
downtown, and marched around the block for an hour, chanting ``Get
rid of dictators.''
   They moved on to Grant Park on Lake Michigan, where they burned
effigies of Prime Minister Li and Deng, China's senior leader. The
pro-Democracy movement is seeking the resignations of the two men.
   After the protest ended, about three dozen natives of Hong Kong
remained for a 24-hour strike. They sat on the grass near a statue
of Abraham Lincoln, and sang songs they said were written by
protesters in their homeland.
   In New York, demonstrators marched from Dag Hammerskjold Plaza
near the United Nations on the East Side to the Chinese Consulate
on the West Side. They carried signs reading ``Down With Chinese
Hitler. We Want Democracy'' and ``Down With Deng Xiaoping.''
   ``I'm afraid that the fight for democracy will be even harder
because the hardliners will move with a firmer hand,'' said Amy
Chak, a 20-year-old native of Hong Kong who is a graduate student
at the University of Chicago.
   ``Though they are not supported by the people, they will
maintain the power for a while,'' said Yukkong Lau, 31-year-old
Hong Kong native who is a doctor at Michael Reese Hospital in
Chicago. ``But I think in a year or two the hardliners will have to
step down.
   ``The Chinese are aware now, they won't keep silent,'' said Lau.

<TEXT>
   Former Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci told graduating
college students Sunday that the Soviet Union's forces are still
geared for offense despite Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's call
for military reductions.
   Carlucci's comments at the University of Scranton (Pa.) came as
President Bush prepared to begin a 16-nation NATO summit that will
include discussion of troop and nuclear weapons cutbacks in Western
Europe.
   ``I am unwilling to trust the future on the success of one man
in the Kremlin,'' Carlucci, who served as secretary in the Reagan
administration, told 886 graduates at the Jesuit school's
commencement services.
   ``The Soviet forces are geared for offense, not defense _
despite Gorbachev's talk of a defensive doctrine,'' the Scranton
native said. ``And I know that the rhetoric of unilateral
reductions has not been accompanied by deed.''
   Other speakers at college commencements around the nation on
Sunday included actress Glenn Close at Mount Holyoke College,
``Good Morning America'' host Charles Gibson at Vassar College and
activist Marian Wright Edelman at Wesleyan University.
   Gibson told 584 graduates at Vassar's 125th commencement in
Poughkeepsie, N.Y., that he wants to beat the ``bejabbers'' out of
the rival ``Today'' show but he also wants ``to know what is
right.''
   Gibson told the assemblage that a student should learn ethics,
responsibility, balance and fairness while in college.
   The ABC-TV personality refered to Chinese students who are
demonstrating for reform and said American students should consider
the protests' larger meaning.
   ``Those students in China know what they stand for. Do you know
what you stand for?'' Gibson said.
   At Wesleyan in Middletown, Conn., 750 graduating students heard
Edelman, the president of the Children's Defense Fund, urge
sweeping changes in the country's priorities.
   ``Don't step over the homeless or pretend that the drugs that
are poisoning our families and children are somebody else's
problem,'' Edelman said.
   Close was the featured speaker at Mount Holyoke's 152nd
commencement in South Hadley, Mass. The actress, known for her
roles in the movies ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``The Natural,'' urged
the college's 513 graduates to take strength from one another.
   ``I hope in the coming years that you will discover what I have
discovered: an indestructible, visceral connection to my college
and her people,'' said Close, a graduate of the College of William
and Mary.
   In Amherst, Mass., Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tracy Kidder
gave the keynote address to about 4,200 undergraduates at the
University of Massachusetts.
   The author of `The Soul of a New Machine'' referred to his
forthcoming book, ``Among Schoolchildren,'' about a year in the
life of a fifth grade class in Holyoke, to call for greater
enthusiasm for education generally and teaching in particular.
   ``The last few years we have heard a great deal about the
failures of public schools and, by implication, of America's
teachers. No one can say that many schools and faculties don't need
to be improved. ... Crisis is the word most often used to describe
conditions in the schools.
   ``And yet what I saw of teaching convinced me that it can be an
exhilarating job.''

   Today is Sunday, June 4, the 155th day of 1989. There are 210
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On June 4, 1940, the Allied military evacuation at Dunkirk,
France, ended. British Prime Minister Winston S. Churchill told the
House of Commons, ``We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight
on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the
streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.''
   On this date:
   In 1647, the English army seized King Charles I as a hostage.
   In 1812, the Louisiana Territory was renamed the Missouri
Territory.
   In 1878, Turkey turned Cyprus over to the British.
   In 1896, Henry Ford made a successful test run with his car in a
nighttime drive through the streets of Detroit.
   In 1942, the Battle of Midway began, resulting in America's
first significant victory over the Japanese in World War II.
   In 1944, Allied forces liberated Rome.
   In 1947, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved
the Taft-Hartley Act. The law was later enacted over President
Harry S. Truman's veto.
   In 1956, the State Department published a partial text of a
closed-door speech given the previous February by Nikita
Khrushchev, in which the Soviet leader denounced his predecessor,
Josef Stalin.
   In 1985, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an Alabama law
allowing daily moments of silence in public schools for
``meditation or voluntary prayer'' by students.
   In 1986, Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy intelligence
analyst, pleaded guilty in Washington to spying for Israel.
   In 1987, the congressional Iran-Contra committees voted to grant
limited immunity to former National Security Council aide Oliver
North, following an appeal by independent counsel Lawrence Walsh to
reject immunity.
   Ten years ago: President John Vorster of South Africa resigned
in the wake of a report charging him with covering up
irregularities in a government agency.
   Five years ago: Addressing the Irish Parliament in Dublin,
President Reagan said he would be willing to consider a Soviet
proposal for a treaty on the ``non-use of force.''
   One year ago: Secretary of State George Shultz flew to Jordan,
trying to win King Hussein's support for a U.S. blueprint for peace
in the Middle East. But Shultz reported that Hussein was reluctant
to support anything short of ``territory for peace.''
   Today's birthdays: Democratic Sen. Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio is
72. Opera singer Robert Merrill is 70. Actor Gene Barry is 67.
Actor Dennis Weaver is 65. Actor Bruce Dern is 53. Retired tennis
player Andrea Jaeger is 24.
   Thought for Today: ``Romance without finance is a nuisance.'' _
