<HEAD>Defense Forces, Noriega Resist; Loyalty Remains Strong Enough</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Instead of collapsing when the United
States threw its military might against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, his Defense Forces stubbornly resisted.
   The elusive general the Bush administration had hoped to put
before a federal judge in Florida on drug charges remains at large
and in hiding despite an attack Wednesday by thousands of American
troops.
   Many in Panama had thought the Defense Forces would simply
``throw down their guns as soon as an American helicopter appeared
over the barracks,'' as a Noriega opponent once put it.
   In interviews prior to the attack, U.S. military leaders had
claimed Defense Forces troops would refuse to shed their blood for
Noriega. Part of their evidence stemmed from the fact that disloyal
officers mounted two coups against him.
   But the general, who sometimes seemed to escape by magic,
apparently retained enough loyalty for his men to put up a fight
when the U.S. stroke came. From Defense Forces posts all over
Panama came reports of stubborn fighting that lasted for hours.
   With their garrisons destroyed or under siege, many Panamanian
officers left and joined small paramilitary groups in urban
guerrilla warfare.
   While U.S. forces had heavy artillery and air power to use
against installations and sent their armored personnel carriers
rolling over fences and cars, Panamanian armed groups fought a
delaying action.
   ``We are acting as urban guerrillas, although we have lost some
positions, some garrisons,'' said Enrique Thompson, the second in
command in the paramilitary groups, known as Dignity Battalions.
   Thompson spoke with an Associated Press reporter as the five men
with him took up positions in the bushes with Soviet-made AK-47
rifles near the Tinajitas garrison, taken over Wednesday morning by
the Americans.
   ``The people are joining the struggle for national
sovereignty,'' he said.
   The Noriega forces marshalled resistance with appeals over the
National Radio, broadcasting in a national network.
   Announcers called on Panamanians to organize neighborhood armed
resistance and guerrilla war. The station played Panamanian
patriotic songs that taunt Americans. Officers even used it to
broadcast instructions to troops and messages to each other, often
in code.
   U.S. forces finally did slowly close down the radio stations
that made up the chain, but it was a slow process.
   ``Incredible,'' said a sweaty U.S. Army sergeant as he listened
to the exhortations. ``That was the first thing we should have
silenced.''
   Unlike the armed forces in other parts of Latin America, the
Defense Forces officer corps is made up largely of men from poor
backgrounds and became the vehicle dictator Omar Torrijos used in
the late 1960s to topple the ruling oligarchy.
   Noriega, a Torrijos disciple, once observed that the upper-class
had only itself to blame when they complained about the Defense
Forces' dominance, because they preferred to make money.
   He openly mocked the upper-class and his supporters frequently
refer to the opposition election victory on May 7 as an effort by
the oligarchy to return to power.
   Noriega promoted officers with poor backgrounds, often from
discriminated-against black and Chinese minorities, and worked hard
to retain their loyalty with lucrative slices of the corruption pie
in Panama.
   But when that loyalty slipped, it did in coup attempts in 1988
and 1989, he reacted brutally, and reports that he personally beat
or shot coup instigators circulated.
   Accused of domestic repression by the U.S. government, he
whipped up nationalistic feelings showing himself as a Panamanian
wrongly accused by the large country that wanted to renege on the
the Panama Canal treaties.
   The invasion was a slap in the face to Panamanians who have
considered themselves friends and allies of the Americans since the
two countries joined hands in the construction of the Panama Canal
at the beginning of the century.
   As the armored personnel carriers rolled out of Fort Clayton
after midnight Wednesday past the Panamanian town of Diablo
Heights, some men and women watching them cursed them or cried.
   ``Whey are they doing this?'' a housewife asked a reporter.
``Are they going to kill our people just for one man?''
   ``The Americans have no control of the situation,'' said Dr.
Leonardo Diaz of the Santo Tomas hospital. ``Their strength is in
their personnel carriers and their Cobras (helicopters), but the
people are angry.''

   The Rolling Stones capped the
next-to-last show of their 32-city North American tour with a guest
appearance by British blues guitarist Eric Clapton for the band's
pay-per-view concert Tuesday night.
   The capacity crowd of 16,000 at Convention Hall roared when the
bearded Clapton stepped to center stage for two bluesy solos during
``Little Red Rooster.''
   The Stones' lead singer, Mick Jagger, in turquoise shirt, black
jeans and silver-studded belt, then joined the Clapton on harmonica.
   Clapton, wearing a black leather jacket and white T-shirt, was
making his first appearance with the Stones on the current tour.
   The pay-per-view concert Tuesday night was to be seen in 13.5
million homes and heard on about 150 radio stations, promoters said.
   The concert, the second of three scheduled at 16,000-seat
Convention Hall, also featured appearances by vocalist Axl Rose and
guitarist Izzy Stradlin of Guns 'n' Roses and by 71-year-old
Southern blues guitar legend John Lee Hooker.
   Rose and Stradlin, introduced by Jagger as having come ``all the
way East to get their tattooes touched up,'' sang, ``Salt of the
Earth'' with the original bad boys of rock 'n' roll.
   Jagger seemed more animated Tuesday night, playing up to the
television cameras, leading middle-aged fans through the new lyrics
of ``Terrifying'' and swaying to ``Ruby Tuesday'' with fans born
after it was first recorded in 1967.
   Tickets for each of the Stones' concerts Sunday, Tuesday and
Wednesday in Atlantic City cost $38.50, $150 and $250.
   The Stones, who have been performing since 1962, opened the tour
Aug. 31 at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia.
   The group took off Monday to celebrate guitarist Keith Richards'
46th birthday.
   Scott Kurnit, the president of Set Pay Per View, the show's
distributor to cable companies, said the suggested retail price for
the concert was $24.95, but added that some cable companies were
charging $19.95.
   Jagger said the live televised performance would inject just the
boost needed for the Stones at the end of their first tour since
1981.
   ``You get wound up for live TV ... especially at the end of a
tour,'' said Jagger, 46.

<TEXT>
   This first installment of a three-part Christmas
series about the relatives of Jesus deals with his ancestral roots.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Everyone is a special sum of ancestry _ to enhance or diminish
through a lifetime. That was so for the child of Christmas, the
product of a heritage.
   Some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery,
before time itself. But others accord him a thoroughly natural
family tree.
   ``He was in the beginning with God,'' says one account, a
``Word'' or ``Logos,'' a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the Creator
before the world began. Yet other passages say he was ``made like
his brethren in every respect.''
   ``Son of man,'' he usually called himself, but also ``Son of
God.''
   He combined ``universality with particularity,'' the ``divine
and human model,'' writes church historian Jaroslav Pelican in his
book ``Jesus Through the Centuries.'' It says a key question put to
him was, ``Where do you come from?''
   Although seldom noted, he had a long string of forebears as well
as contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help. His
lineage ran deep into Jewish history.
   As with most people if their descent is traced back far enough,
he had a checkered ancestry, good and bad, the lowly and great,
kings, betrayers, heroes, adulterers, warriors and prostitutes.
   It was an odd assortment, like humanity itself, alien Gentiles
and fellow Jews, the weak and strong, upright and corrupt. The fact
that he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic
to his purpose: becoming identified with all humankind.
   They ``were all members of Jesus' family, his great-great-great
grandaddies and grandmamas in the faith,'' wrote church scholar
William H. Willimon. ``For all their weaknesses and shortcomings,
this motley but richly human crew were indeed his people.''
   Two genealogies of Jesus are recorded, one in the first chapter
of the Book of Matthew, the other in the third chapter of the Book
of Luke. They vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably
assume Luke gives the line of his mother, Mary, and that Matthew
gives that of Joseph, legally the father.
   ``It is possible that the original genealogy did interpret
Joseph as the father of Jesus, that is, that it had been formulated
before the understanding of Jesus as the divinely generated son of
God,'' writes New Testament scholar Henrikus Boers in his book
``Who Was Jesus?''
   Some progenitors are on both lists, including olden patriarchs
of Judaism and Israel's great King David, along with other lesser
figures of sundry character.
   Matthew lists 41 ancestors, starting back at the time of
Abraham, ancient father of Israel, and other early patriarchs,
Isaac and Jacob.
   Luke lists 77 progenitors in reverse order, starting with Joseph
and enumerating others going back to the first man, Adam, and
finally to his creator, God.
   Other figures out of dim antiquity also are included, such as
Noah, and that legend of longevity, Methuselah, who lived 969
years, all designated ancestors of Jesus.
   In the mostly male lists, four women are named, and they're a
mixed group _ a soldier's beautiful wife, Bathsheba, seduced by
King David; the harlot of Jericho, Rahab; the sexually maneuvering
Cananite, Tamar; and the loyal Mohabite, Ruth.
   Tamar was the daugher-in-law of Judah, son of the patriarch
Jacob. Her husband died and after prolonged widowhood, she
disguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her father-in-law to
lie with her. She bore twins, one named Perez, also among Jesus'
forbears.
   Rahab was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the
Israelite warrior-leader Joshua to spy out Jericho before taking
it. She hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop.
   She later helped the pair escape, lowering them on a rope from a
window in her house, which was built into the city wall. By
agreement with the two, her clan was spared when Jericho was
destroyed, her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window.
   The devoted woman of Moab, Ruth, widowed by her Hebrew husband,
insisted on returning with her mother-in-law, Naomi, to Israel,
with these memorable words: ``For where you go I will go ... your
people will be my people, and your God my God.''
   On Naomi's advice, Ruth worked in the harvest, sleeping at the
feet of the owner, Boaz, thus winning him as her husband. They were
parents of Obed, father of Jesse, who fathered King David.
   His philandering with Bathsheba, the gorgeous wife of an absent
military officer, Uriah, produced sons Nathan and future King
Solomon, alternatively listed in Jesus' line of descent.
   Other men on the lists also displayed foibles, such as Jacob's
deceiving his father to gain an inheritance, and even Abraham
fearfully palming off his lovely wife, Sarah, as his ``sister'' to
placate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in Egypt.
   Nevertheless, those honored patriarchs also displayed courage,
initiative and devotion in their covenant with God to lead a people
that would be a promised ``light to the nations.''
   The great Israelite military commander, Joshua, successor to
Moses, also is listed, along with a long succession of kings,
decent and debauched, in addition to charming, psalm-singing David
and wise Solomon, credited with the Book of Proverbs and builder of
Jerusalem's first Temple.
   Other kings include Rehoboam, whose oppressions, idolatrous
rites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom;
Uzziah, stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign, and Hezekiah
who led reforms under guidance of the prophet Micah.
   Also listed is Manasseh, described as ``the most wicked king of
Judah,'' whose religious deviations included Baalism, exaltation of
the idol Astarte, wizardry and Molech worship that involved forcing
children through fire.
   Tradition has it that Manasseh had the great prophet Isaiah
sawed asunder.
   One king listed, Josiah, took the throne at age 8 when his
father, Amon, was murdered. But Josiah had a long, just reign,
ousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost ``Book of law'' in
repairing the Temple.
   Of many others named, some are clouded, uncertain figures, while
others are notable in Jewish annals, such as Judah, founder of a
main Israelite tribe, and the prophet Nathan who rebuked David for
his illicit affair.
   The mixed lot of people, with their sundry faults and strengths,
were all ``part of the promise fulfilled'' by the Christ child,
Willimon writes. They, ``for all their weaknesses, ... were
instruments of the promise.''
   On the other hand, Jesus' descent also is traced directly to the
Godhead, adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity.
   ``In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God,'' says the distinctively interpretative gospel of
John. ``And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace
and truth.''
   He is ``fully God and fully man,'' classic Christian doctrine
says. His conception by the virgin Mary is ascribed by the gospels
to divine intervention. St. Paul calls him the ``image of the
invisible God.''
   Jesus himself, though he was generally elusive about it and
though he identified closely with common folk, sometimes laid it
out plainly, as related by John's gospel:
   ``Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am,'' he
said. ``I and the Father are one ... the Father is in me and I am
in the Father.''

<HEAD>Leader Of Failed Homeland Coup Gets 18-Year Prison Term</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A soldier who led a failed
coup attempt in one of South Africa's nominally independent black
homelands has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for high treason.
   Warrant Officer Timothy Phiri was the last of 142 soldiers to be
sentenced for their roles in a February 1988 coup attempt in
Bophuthatswana, one of four tribal homelands designated independent
by South Africa but not recognized abroad.
   The other defendants, convicted last month of treason or
terrorism, were sentenced Monday and Tuesday to prison terms
ranging from 2 to 10 years.
   The coup was crushed by South African commandos, who freed
homeland president Lucas Mangope from captivity at a soccer stadium
and arrested the rebels, all members of the homeland army.
   Bophuthatswana Supreme Court Justice M.W. Friedman said Phiri
was ``a danger to society'' who had allowed Mangope to be
ill-treated during the coup attempt and had ordered his rebels to
fire on the homes of homeland Cabinet ministers.

   Robert Robinson, the alderman and lawyer
assassinated by a mail bomb, is being remembered as an easygoing,
generous man whose community affairs work made people ``believe
they can make a difference.''
   Robinson, whom even new acquaintances called ``Robbie,'' died
Monday when a package containing an explosive and nails blew up at
his law office.
   Robinson and Mayor John Rousakis had planned to attend a meeting
that evening at the lawyer's church to discuss how blacks could
fight drugs in their neighborhoods. Robinson was black.
   The 42-year-old attorney was the second victim in a rash of mail
bombs in the South. A package bomb killed 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals Judge Robert S. Vance on Saturday. A mail bomb found at
the federal courthouse in Atlanta was disarmed Monday. A parcel
bomb mailed to the NAACP's Jacksonville, Fla., office was disarmed
Tuesday.
   On Tuesday, Savannah's legislative offices were closed in
mourning.
   Rousakis said Robinson ``was a warm, kind person, always with a
smile on his face and a hand out to help.''
   ``He meant the future to Savannah, he gave to the community in
such a selfless way that he made people just believe they can make
a difference,'' said Alderman Willie Brown.
   At a news conference, city leaders said they believed Robinson's
involvement with the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, which he represented in a school desegregation
case, was related to his death.
   Rousakis said Robinson was an active member of his church and
was worked to help the homeless.
   Friends said Robinson's political activity was not the kind that
would be expected to generate murderous enemies.
   ``I've known him a very long time, and he is not the kind of guy
I would think would be a target of such an action,'' said Superior
Court Judge Eugene Gadsden. ``He was easygoing and went about his
business.''
   Longtime friend Al Rivers said Robinson took part in civil
rights protests until he went off to college. ``Then he came back,
got into politics and his time began to get tight.''
   Rousakis said Robinson had been a city councilman for eight
years, but had served on other government and community boards his
entire adult life.
   As city transit authority chairman 10 years ago, Robinson led a
move to provide transportation for the poor and the elderly.
   Robinson, one of the first black students to attend Savannah
High School in the 1960s, represented the NAACP in the long-running
Savannah schools desegregation case.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in October that the
city's magnet-school plan was appropriate for desegregation.
   Neither city nor school officials knew whether the NAACP was
planning to appeal, and NACCP head Curtis Cooper could not be
reached for comment.
   Robinson is survived by his wife, Ann, and three daughters.
Alderman Floyd Adams Jr. said city officials would start a fund for
Robinson's family.
   Rousakis said a local business, All-American Builders, had
already donated a $1,000 reward for information in the case.
   ``We are sure the Savannah Police Department will not quit until
they come to some conclusion,'' Alderman Brown said. ``Meanwhile,
the fund gives people a way to prove their love for Robbie.''

<TEXT>
   In contrast to the largely peaceful
changes in other Eastern European countries, President Nicolae
Ceausescu of Romania appears determined to use force to defend his
hard-line regime.
   Ceausescu, 71, the most senior Soviet bloc leader after 24 years
in power, has said reform-minded Communists elsewhere have betrayed
their people by refusing to defend Marxist orthodoxy.
   Ceausescu's refusal to embrace change has isolated him from all
his Warsaw Pact allies. Some analysts say he is seeking stronger
ties with rigid Communist systems similarly opposed to political
reform, particularly North Korea, Cuba and China.
   His leadership is based on a family dynasty with some 40
relatives reportedly placed in key state and party jobs. His wife
Elena, virtual second-in-command in Romania, is a Politburo member
and first vice premier.
   One of Ceausescu's brothers, Ilie, is an army general and deputy
defense minister. Another brother, Nicolae Andruta, is a police
general and deputy interior minister and another brother, Ion, is
in charge of economic planning.
   His youngest son, Nicu, 39, is a Politburo candidate member and
party chief of Sibiu region in southern Transylvania.
   ``Romania is a showcase for any repressive totalitarian state.
The harsher the repression, the more violent the public upheaval it
brings about and the greater the desire to take revenge on
leaders,'' Ion Ratiu, chairman of the London-based World Union of
Free Romanians, said Monday.
   Since he became party leader in 1965, Ceausescu has exercised
absolute power and carried out a foreign policy independent of the
Soviet Union.
   While that maverick stance won him praise and credits from the
West, Ceausescu kept Romanians under iron-fisted control. Now, with
reform ascendent in the rest of the Warsaw Pact, the harsh Romanian
stand draws condemnation from abroad.
   About 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the Jiu Valley in
1977 and 10,000 workers demonstrated in the city of Brasov in 1987
demanding freedom, better living conditions and Ceausescu's ouster.
Police arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders
disappeared.
   An extensive secret police force keeps strict control on
religious and political expression, and dissent is quickly crushed,
making chances for peaceful change in Romania seem remote.
   But poverty and despair engendered by economic problems and
political repressions could cause people to risk direct
confrontations with armed forces, as in Timisoara now.
   Unlike recent protests in Prague and East Germany, witnessed and
reported by the Western media, demonstrations in Romania have taken
place well outside the public eye.
   The Western reporters permitted into the country in recent years
have been kept under close watch, and police have detained
journalists and even diplomats attempting to visit the country's
few dissidents.
   Romania has closed its borders and barred most foreigners from
entering the country in an apparent attempt to prevent the spread
of news about the Timisoara protest, the largest demonstration
against Ceausescu's policies since the Brasov riots.
   Romania has little tradition of democratic rule. After five
centuries under the Ottoman Turks, Romania won independence in
1877, becoming first a monarchy, then, during the Second World War,
an ally of the Nazis.
   The last monarch, King Michael, was forced to abdicate in
December 1947 under threat of civil war and pressure from the
Kremlin and its Romanian Communist allies.

<TEXT>
   Two leading art auctioneers are reporting more
than doubled yearly sales with the market for impressionist,
modern, and contemporary art racing to dizzying heights.
   Sotheby's fine art auctioneers on Tuesday reported worldwide
sales in 1989 of $2.9 billion, a 61 percent increase on 1988. And
Christie's reported worldwide sales in 1989 of $2.2 billion, a 69
percent increase.
   Michael L. Ainslie, president and chief executive officer of
Sotheby's Holdings Inc. said in a statement: ``The opportunities
for forming major collections have never been better as the flow of
significant works onto the market is stronger than we have ever
witnessed.
   ``More collectors are participating in our business, and
balanced competition from Asia, Europe and the United States has
become a regular feature of the international art auction market.''
   Sotheby's said auctions of Impressionist, modern and
contemporary art worldwide during its autumn sales season this year
alone accounted for $797 million of overall sales.
   Lord Carrington, chairman of Christie's International, said in a
statement: ``The strength of the market has been underpinned by the
growth in world wealth and the emergence of new buyers into the
arena. This has caused a change in the emphasis of the market
place, which has become more international.''
   He said New York has become the leading sales center.

<HEAD>World War II Planner Dead at 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT BELVOIR, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Albert C. Wedemeyer, who drafted
the ``Germany first'' strategy under which the allied coalition led
by the United States and Britain won World War II, is dead. He was
92.
   Wedemeyer, who had Alzheimer's Disease, died Sunday at the
Fairfax Retirement Center at Fort Belvoir.
   Wedemeyer was a temporary lieutenant colonel when the United
States entered the war in December 1941. His first major assignment
came earlier that year when President Franklin D. Roosevelt asked
the then War Department for suggestions as to how to win the war
that the nation was surely going to have to enter.
   Gen. Wedemeyer, at that time the only American officer to have
graduated from the Germany Army general staff college, drew up what
became known as the ``Victory Program,'' advocating the defeat of
German armies on the continent of Europe by allied ground troops.
   After the U.S. entry into the war, a refined version of the plan
was adopted by Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winwston
Churchill, and, despite a few detours, led to the invasion of
Normandy in June 1944 and the defeat of Germany.
   Wedemeyer stayed with the War Department until October 1943 when
he was made deputy chief of staff to British Adm. Lord Louis
Montbatten, the commander-in-chief of the Southeast Asia Command.
   After returning to the United States in 1946, he took on a
fact-finding mission in China, racked by civil war between
Communist and Kuomintang forced, for President Truman, and held
stateside posts until his retirement in 1954.
   His decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal with
Oak Leaf Cluster and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
   In retirement, he served as director of several corporations,
published his memoirs and settled on a farm in Boyds, Md. He moved
into the Fairfax Retirement Home earlier this year.
   Wedemyer is survived by his wife, Elizabeth; two sons, six
grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.

<HEAD>Baker `Regrets' Misleading Statement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he
regrets possibly misleading the American public about a secret trip
to China taken by two high-level Bush administration officials.
   Baker said through a spokeswoman Tuesday night ``he felt
obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission the president wished
to have classified.''
   Speaking for Baker, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler added: ``He
regrets that he may have misled some...''
   It was the first acknowledgement of error since the White House
announced on Dec. 9 that national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger were visiting
Beijing.
   Their trip was roundly condemned in Congress as a friendly
gesture to China and a cancellation of the ban President Bush
imposed on high-level exchanges after pro-democracy students were
massacred in early June in Tiananmen Square.
   Another sanction crumbled Tuesday night when Bush moved to end a
ban that prevented the U.S. Export-Import bank from providing
financial aid to companies doing business in China.
   Also, the White House announced that Bush had approved the
export of three communications satellites expected to be launched
by China, saying the deal was in the ``national interest.''
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., called Bush's approval of the
satellite export licenses ``a true outrage'' and ``another effort
to curry favor with the hardliners in Beijing and an insult to the
memory of those who died for democracy in Tiananmen Square.''
   Criticism also mounted on Capitol Hill against this month's
visit by Scowcroft and Eagleburger to Beijing, as well as an
earlier one in July.
   ``To have sent two of our highest level officials to Beijing
only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the
president look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite in
Washington,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., a leading
congressional spokesman on Asia issues.
   In defense of Bush's actions, White House spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater said: ``It is not misleading to not tell you about
everything he's doing. The president's up there in the Oval Office
doing things all day long that you don't know and won't know about
and that's not misleading.''
   Baker, appearing on ABC-TV on Dec. 10, called the trip taken in
early December to Beijing by Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``the first
time we've had high-level U.S. officials go to the People's
Republic of China.''
   On Monday, however, the White House disclosed Scowcroft and
Eagleburger also had made a secret trip to China in July.
   Asked about the apparent discrepancy, State Department
spokeswoman Tutwiler said Baker had explicitly acknowledged the
December trip by Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``was not the first time
we had high-level contacts'' with China since the crackdown.
   She noted that Baker mentioned on ABC his own meeting in August
with Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at a conference on
Cambodia in Paris.
   ``He specifically referred to his own contacts,'' Ms. Tutwiler
said. ``But he felt obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission
that the president wished to have classified.
   ``He regrets that he may have misled some, but he felt that by
acknowledging his own direct involvement it was sufficient to make
the point that this was not the first case of high-level contact.''
   Gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch of
U.S.-manufacturered satellites on Chinese rockets unless the
president declares it to be in the U.S. national interest, as Bush
has done.
   The Hughes Aircraft Co. is selling the satellites to firms in
Australia and Hong Kong for launching on a Chinese rocket.
   ``Approval of these licences is in keeping with the president's
policy not to disrupt normal commercial relations with China,'' a
White House statement added.
   ``These satellites are intended for civil use and represent
significant investments for the firms, based in Australia and Hong
Kong,'' the statement said. ``It is in the national interest of the
United States to approve export licenses for the three satellites
currently being prepared for launch in China.''
   The White House also cited ``national interest'' in waiving
restrictions on the Export-Import bank's financing of U.S. business
activities within China.
   The White House said the waiver ``preserves a level playing
field for U.S. business. Additional business activity with China
will be considered on a case-by-case basis as part of a continuing
review process.''
   One of the few on Capitol Hill who has supported Bush's
overtures, Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said sending Scowcroft and
Eagleburger to underscore human rights concerns ``was exactly in
conformity with the congressional position, which reflected the
views of the American people.''
   But Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., a senior member of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said ``the administration did what it
told us they were not doing.''
   ``Surely the Chinese would see it that way. If we send the
national security adviser to the president, there is no sanction
from the standpoint of China. I don't buy that distinction at
all,'' Hamilton said.

   Bassam Z. Shakhashiri is ushering in the
Christmas season with a bang.
   Several hundred children squealed with delight Tuesday night
when a loud boom and burst of flames from an exploding hydrogen
balloon signaled the start of the Lebanese-born professor's 20th
annual Christmas science show.
   It's called ``Once Upon a Christmas Cheery in the Lab of
Shakhashiri,'' and he's taking his popular chemistry lecture this
season to Madison, Wis., Washington and Boston.
   Standing on the stage of the National Academy of Sciences
auditorium, Shakhashiri doffed his tuxedo jacket, black bow tie and
ruffled shirt and set to work wearing a ``Science is Fun'' T-shirt.
   For the next hour, he captivated his audience of more than 600
kids and their parents with a demonstration of ``the beauty, the
magic and the adventure'' of science, often using ordinary
household chemicals found in vinegar, laundry detergent and
disposable diapers.
   As Shakhashiri performed his scientific sleight of hand, bottles
popped their corks, a metal can collapsed, a phony dollar bill
vanished in a puff, a dishpan overflowed with fog, clear liquids
turned into Yuletide greens and reds or glowed in the dark, and a
gooey yellow stuff kept oozing out of its glass jar like a yogurt
machine gone haywire.
   While a visiting Santa Claus applauded from the front row,
Shakhashiri delivered his show-stopping finale, shaking a flask
containing silver nitrate, ammonia, sugar and other ingredients to
produce a giant, shiny Christmas tree ornament. Then he made his
pitch to the wide-eyed youngsters.
   Have fun and work hard in school, he said, and think about a
career in science or mathematics ``because our country needs you.''
   Shakhashiri, whose first name rhymes with ``Shazam'' and means
``Smiley'' in his native Beirut, emigrated to the United States
with his parents in 1957. He is a chemistry professor at the
University of Wisconsin at Madison on leave as assistant director
of the National Science Foundation, an independent federal agency
that awards grants to colleges and public schools for scientific
education and research.
   It was at the Wisconsin campus that Shakhashiri delivered his
first Christmas lecture ``for kids of all ages'' in 1970. He
borrowed the idea from Michael Faraday, the great English chemist
and physicist whose Christmas science lectures for children were
popular in the 1840s.
   ``I'm trying to share the excitement and joy of doing hands-on
science,'' Shakhashiri said in an interview. ``I don't try to snow
anybody with technical details. My idea is to capture their
interest and not allow them to extinguish their flame of
curiosity.''
   Shakhashiri is disturbed by a foundation estimate that the
United States faces a cumulative shortfall of 450,000 native-born
college graduates with bachelor's degrees in science, math and
engineering by the year 2000, and a projected shortage of 8,000
scientists with doctorates by 2004.
   ``It's very, very alarming,'' he says. The nation desperately
needs highly trained scientists to tackle such challenges as the
superconducting super collider, space stations, human genetic
mapping and the AIDS epidemic, he says.
   ``What's at stake is the pre-eminence of the United States in
science and technology and the global economy, and the quality of
life not only in the United States but on earth,'' Shakhashiri said.

   It was a big bull, but it didn't sit well
outside the New York Stock Exchange.
   The 3-ton bronze bull sculpture, which turned up uninvited
Friday outside the exchange, is being moved to a park in the Wall
Street area, said city Parks Department spokesman Skip Garrett.
   The city yanked the sculpture from its spot outside the market
last week, but it has changed its mind. Parks Commissioner Henry
Stern was scheduled to dedicate it today.
   ``It's our custom to allow sculptors to display their works in
city parks. Henry's found the bull a temporary home,'' Garrett said
Tuesday.
   The sculptor, Arturo DiModica, was ecstatic about the city's
reversal.
   ``I feel fantastic,'' said DiModica, who spent two years and
$300,000 on his work, ``The Charging Bull.''
   DiModica brought the bull to the stock exchange under cover of
darkness Thursday, but within 24 hours the unlicensed art work was
hauled off. Garrett said the bull's home will not be permanent,
although Garrett didn't have a time frame for its departure.

   A private yacht navigator has won
enough money to buy a yacht of his own after claiming a $13.6
million Lotto prize.
   Hagne Murray of Fort Lauderdale and his wife, Theresa, were
celebrating their wedding anniversary Saturday night and didn't
even look at their tickets until late Sunday after hearing the
winning ticket had been sold in Fort Lauderdale.
   Mrs. Murray, 32, was already in bed when her husband told her
about the winning tickets. ``I thought he was kidding,'' she said.
   Murray, 39, who bought 20 tickets for the drawing, had played
the same numbers for weeks.
   On Dec. 10, he matched four numbers on one pick, winning $127.
   ``When I matched four numbers, I felt like the marlin was
tugging a little bit on my line,'' Murray said Tuesday. ``So I
played those numbers again and landed the big one.''
   By matching the winning numbers, 01-06-22-23-34-47, the Murrays
will receive $684,000 before taxes annually for the next 20 years.
The Murrays have four children, ages 12 to 19. They have no plans
for the money yet, but will go ahead with a planned vacation this
week.

   A spy plane that was one of the
mainstays of Cold War intelligence-gathering today was marking its
25th anniversary with a flight over its maker's once-secret plants.
   The SR-71 Blackbird was to take off from Air Force Plant 42 in
Palmdale and fly over Lockheed Corp.'s plants in Burbank and Rye
Canyon.
   An SR-71 first flew on Dec. 22, 1964. Since then, Blackbirds,
which can fly at least three times the speed of sound and higher
than 85,000 feet, have helped U.S. intelligence keep watch on
sensitive areas around the globe.
   President Bush last week signed a defense appropriation bill
that did not include funding for the SR-71. Defense Secretary
Richard Cheney and other top Pentagon officials had advocated
dropping the program.
   The Blackbird _ angular, with short wings and enormous engines _
replaced the U-2, a high-flying but slow craft.

<HEAD>Soviet Miners to Visit; Solidarity-like Support Promised</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO says it will host a nearly
month-long visit to the United States by 10 Soviet miners seeking
to form independent unions and promises to support the miners even
if it has to defy the Soviet government.
   Lane Kirkland, president of the 14.1 million-member labor
federation, announced Tuesday that the delegation would arrive in
the United States on Dec. 29 for a nearly month-long stay.
   The visit will begin in New York and bring the miners to
Washington on Jan. 3. A more detailed itinerary was not available,
but the delegation plans to visit some U.S. mines to study mining
and safety practices, Kirkland said.
   The miners will be the guests of the AFL-CIO but their trip is
being paid for by through a U.S. Information Agency exchange
program.
   The AFL-CIO has repeatedly refused torecognize visits by members
of government-sanctioned Soviet unions, arguing those are little
more than puppet organizations.
   The miners requested the AFL-CIO's support last month and
Kirkland, likening their struggle to that of Solidarity organizers
in Poland in the early 1980s, promised American unions would
deliver.
   ``If necessary,'' was Kirkland's response when asked if the
AFL-CIO would take the same steps it took to support Solidarity,
which included the smuggling of printing and other communications
equipment into Poland during the period in which Solidarity was
outlawed. In all, the federation gave about $5 million worth of
equipment and other assistance to Solidarity.
   Although it refused to allow the federation delegation into the
Soviet Union, Kirkland noted that the Soviet government had allowed
two trade union activists to attend the AFL-CIO's recent convention
and had granted exit visas to the miners, all members of strike
committees which have been at loggerheads with the Kremlin.
   Because of those steps, Kirkland said it was clear ``there is a
measure of glasnost'' in Kremlin policy toward independent union
activity and said that made it unclear whether the Soviet
government would move to block AFL-CIO support of the miners.
   ``I'm interested in testing its limits,'' Kirkland said of the
Soviet government.
   The Soviet miners scheduled to visit were among the leaders of
strikes by thousands of Soviet miners beginning last summer. Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev was critical of the strikers, accusing
them of undermining his efforts to revive the Soviet economy.

<HEAD>Kemp Vows Swift Action to Improve Ethics Oversight</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp says he is moving quickly to correct problems that caused a
congressional study to say HUD has an ``extremely weak'' ethics
review system.
   Kemp's pledge came Tuesday following the release of a General
Accounting Office study that said HUD was failing to make sure
consultants filed financial disclosure forms and was not reviewing
the ones filed by employees.
   ``We found that HUD's system for obtaining and reviewing
disclosure statements is extremely weak, for its own employees as
well as for experts and consultants,'' GAO said.
   ``The fact that the problems we are reporting have existed for
so long demonstrates to us that the HUD secretary has not held the
(ethics officials) sufficiently accountable for developing and
administering an effective financial disclosure system.''
   GAO said there have been three HUD workers who have filled in as
the agency's chief ethics officer since Kemp took over early this
year, and said there has not been a staff and resource commitment
to policing for conflicts of interest.
   ``It appears that to a large extent it is business as usual at
the Department of Housing and Urban Development,'' said Sen. David
Pryor, D-Ark., who requested and released the report. ``I am
faulting Secretary Kemp.''
   Kemp, through HUD General Counsel Francis Keating, acknowledged
the problems.
   Keating said Kemp would hire a new chief ethics officer by
year's end and would soon fully staff an expanded ethics department.
   A new ethics manual also will be published by the end of the
year and all HUD employees are being required to attend ethics
seminars, Keating said.
   ``There are still things that need to be done but they are being
done,'' Keating said. ``No one is having to make a convert at this
department on the subject of ethics.''
   The GAO said it reviewed the files of 62 consultants hired by
HUD from 1986 to 1989 and that 52 had not filed required financial
disclosure forms.
   The agency, the investigative arm of Congress, also said that
HUD received 62 disclosure reports from employees who are required
to file them but that the agency had not reviewed any of them more
than 100 days later. Ethics law requires that the reports, designed
to uncover possible conflicts of interest, be reviewed within60
days.
   Keating said most have since been reviewed and the rest would be
scrutinized by Jan. 15.
   GAO said the problems date back at least seven years and persist
despite Kemp's promises to rid the agency of mismanagement,
political influence and other problems blamed for a number of
agency scandals during the Reagan administration.
   It is the second time Kemp's administration has come under some
criticism in a study of agency management. The department's
inspector general issued an earlier report praising Kemp's plans to
reform the oversight of agents HUD contracts to sell properties but
said the department's regional offices were slow in implementing
the changes.

   Stiff high-altitude winds forced a delay Tuesday night, just as
they had on Monday. Technical and weather problems caused two
postponements earlier in December.
   ``The upper level winds are too strong for Titan this evening,''

   The launch was rescheduled for 7:21 p.m. today.

   Democrats are attacking Sen. Phil Gramm for
handpicking candidates to challenge Texas' Democratic congressmen
next year, but they say the senator's record of choosing Republican
losers gives them little to worry about.
   Calling those who complain ``wacko,'' Gramm says the Democrats
are running scared because ``1990 doesn't look like a good year for
them.''
   Gramm, a first-term Republican, is running for re-election next
year and is not believed to be currently facing a serious
challenge. His only announced opponent is Democratic state Sen.
Hugh Parmer, a former mayor of Fort Worth. The filing deadline is
Jan. 2.
   While Gramm's people say the senator is concentrating on his own
race, Howard Schloss, spokesman for the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, claims Gramm has handpicked challengers to
Reps. Jim Chapman of Sulphur Springs, Greg Laughlin of West
Columbia and Bill Sarpalius of Amarillo.
   ``He's going into the district, handpicking the candidate,
forcing him down the throat of the local Republican Party, then the
candidate loses and everybody has hard feelings,'' Schloss says.
``He's being a real Lone Ranger, causing problems in his own
party.''
   Gramm intervened this summer in a special election to fill the
Fort Worth seat vacated by former House Speaker Jim Wright when he
released a name recognition poll conducted by Dr. Bob Lanier,
signaling to local Republicans they should rally behind the
physician.
   Lanier lost a close race to Democrat Pete Geren.
   In 1985, Gramm helped create a congressional opening by
recommending Democratic Rep. Sam B. Hall Jr. for a federal
judgeship. Gramm backed Republican candidate Edd Hargett, who lost
the election despite outspending Chapman 3-1.
   Gramm, however, says he's not handpicking candidates, merely
talking to people who are interested in running for office. State
GOP Chairman Fred Meyer and Gary Koops, a spokesman for the
National Republican Congressional Committee, agree and say the
senator is a tireless worker for the party.
   ``I've talked to 200 people about running for governor,
lieutenant governor, attorney general, Congress, state Senate,
state representative, county commission, county sheriff. People who
are interested in running for office talk to me,'' Gramm said.
   But several Texas Democrats say Gramm's intervention damages the
congressional delegation's bipartisan unity.
   ``It creates schisms and divisions that we don't need, as well
as bitterness _ there's no way better way to alienate a person than
to go out and solicit someone to run against him. It's one of the
most personally offensive things anybody could possible do,''
Wright says. ``I wish he would reconsider and consider the effect
on the delegation.''
   Countered Gramm: ``Wright was elected running against a
long-time entrenched incumbent. Did that tear up the delegation? I
think what's happening is that the Democrats are getting scared.''
   With the delegation's clout at low ebb from Wright's resignation
and other setbacks, Democratic Rep. John Bryant says Gramm's
interference is particularly unwelcome as Texans fight to preserve
federal funding for several state projects.
   ``It's very difficult to work with a guy who spends all of his
time trying to create political problems for you,'' Bryant says.
``He does it every two years _ the opponents he recruits always
lose, but it creates an enormous amount of ill-will in the
congressional delegation. He's hard to work with anyway, a
shameless headline seeker, and this just makes it worse.''

<HEAD>ABC's `Roseanne' Beats Out NBC's `Cosby' in Ratings Race</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC's ``Roseanne'' reclaimed the top spot in
the Nielsen ratings and NBC's ``The Cosby Show'' fell to third
place. ``Married...With Children'' zoomed to 13th place.
   So far this season, ``Roseanne'' and ``Cosby'' each have won six
times. NBC's ``Cheers,'' which was second last week, has had one
first-place finish.
   The brash Al and Peg Bundy of ``Married...With Children''
flirted with the top 10 with their Christmas special.
   Its rating of 18.4 was Fox's best ever. Its 13th place finish
was better than Bob Hope's Christmas show on NBC, ABC's ``Who's the
Boss?'' and ``Coach,'' and NBC's ``In the Heat of the Night'' and
``Matlock.''
   NBC won the week with an average rating of 14.7. CBS had 12.6
and ABC 12.3. A ratings point represents the percentage of the
nation's 92.1 million television households tuned to a show.
   The second-place finish was CBS' best performance since the week
that ended Oct. 22.
   For the season, NBC leads with 14.9 to ABC's 13.2 and CBS' 12.3.
   Here's the top 10: ABC's ``Roseanne''; NBC's ``Cheers,'' ``The
Cosby Show,'' ``The Golden Girls,'' ``A Different World''; a
three-way tie for sixth place between NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' CBS'
``60 Minutes'' and ABC's ``Wonder Years''; NBC's ``Dear John'' and
``L.A. Law.''
   The two-hour movie marking the return of CBS' ``Beauty and the
Beast'' was 37th. The show's first regular episode was 54th.
   ABC maintained first place among evening news shows. ABC had a
rating of 11.0 to CBS' 10.4 and NBC's 10.2

<HEAD>NTSB Blames Deaths on Lack of Coast Guard Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal safety investigators are blaming the
boat accident deaths of four people in Oregon last year on the
Coast Guard's failure to require lifeboats and a signal beacon on
the vessel that carried them.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has tried for years to
get the Coast Guard to toughen requirements for an estimated 4,700
small commercial vessels that are equipped to carry 300,000
passengers.
   ``There has been a long, documented absence of regulatory
action,'' said board member Jim Burnett.
   The NTSB's 3-0 decision Tuesday was the first time it has said
the service's lack of regulations contributed to deaths in an ocean
accident. The Sept. 15, 1988, incident off the coast of Oregon
involved the sinking of the Cougar, a 46-foot vessel used to carry
passengers on a fishing trip.
   After the boat took on water and sank, passengers and crew were
left in the cold Pacific Ocean, clinging to float devices and
debris, for 18 hours as searchers tried to locate them. The
captain, a deckhand and two passengers died. A ship's mate and four
other passengers survived.
   The last victim drowned 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued
the others about 35 miles out into the ocean, west of Depoe Bay,
investigators said.
   The board also blamed the Coast Guard for failing during
inspections to confirm the watertightness of hatchcovers on boat's
deck.
   Its report said the probable cause of the accident was the
captain's failure to ensure that his hatchcovers were watertight,
that the bilge pump was operating properly and that rubber flaps
designed to let water flow off the deck were correctly installed.
The captain was not identified in the report.
   The flaps were on the wrong side, preventing water from flowing
off the deck, investigators said. The ship sank in moderately heavy
seas while returning from a fishing trip, after its crew and
passengers tried for 90 minutes to remove water with buckets.
   The board for years has recommended that the Coast Guard require
all passenger boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that
emergency position indicating radio beacons, or EPRIBs, be carried
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers.
   In the last five years, the board has investigated five
passenger vessel accidents, including two collisions, one fire, one
capsizing and one grounding. In each case, Coast Guard survival
craft requirements were found inadequate, but there has been no
change in the regulations.
   The board recommended that the Coast Guard require that within
five years all flotation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced
by lifeboats, life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people
out of the water.
   Passengers using flotation devices remain in the water where
they can suffer from a rapid loss of body heat, or hypothermia.
   The board also advised the Coast Guard to improve its testing
rules and procedures and require all passenger vessel operators to
file sailing plans before they set out.

   Mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire
was heard in the capital Tuesday night as U.S. tanks and truckloads
of American troops headed toward Panama's military headquarters.
   Planes and helicopters were flying over the city.
   The movement indicated U.S. forces were attempting to force
Panama's military leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega out of power.
   ABC-TV quoted Panamanian armed forces television as reporting
that the U.S. military had been ordered into action against the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   It said gunfire and explosions were heard in the vicinity of
Defense Forces headquarters, where Noriega has offices. Gunfire was
heard near the U.S. base Fort Clayton, 6 miles north of the city.
   Three young Panamanian soldiers told an Associated Press
reporter in the capital ``There is all kinds of hell loose out
there.''
   The reporter saw 24 U.S. tanks and at least four trucks carrying
American troops head in the direction of Panamanian Defense Forces
headquarters.
   Troops in olive uniforms ran through the luxury Marriott Hotel
and lights in the hotel went out.
   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,
issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement by
unauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic and
political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges in February 1988. U.S. sanctions have depressed
the economy, but have not budged Noriega, and two coup attempts _
most recently in October _ failed to unseat him.
   U.S. troops in Panama had been on maximum alert and restricted
to base since a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians on
Saturday in what American officials called an unprovoked incident.
   There had been reports all day Tuesday of unusual U.S. troop and
military plane movement in Panama and the United States.
   The United States maintains 12,000 troops in Panama, at
installations including Fort Clayton, Fort Amador _ a joint
U.S.-Panamanian base across a causeway from the capital and U.S.
Southern Command headquarters at Quarry Heights, bordering the
capital to the west.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces has 15,000 regular troops but
Noriega has also armed citizen ``Dignity Battalians'' of his
loyalists.
   Noriega accuses the United States of trying to oust him so it
can renege on 1977 treaties under which Washington is to cede
control of the Panama Canal by the end of the century.

   Machine-gun and cannon fire resounded
through the capital Tuesday night as U.S. tanks and truckloads of
American troops headed toward Panama's military headquarters in an
apparent bid to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The Panamanian leader had said Friday that Panama was in a
``state of war'' with the United States and the following day a
U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians in what American
officials called an unprovoked attack.
   U.S. troops in Panama have been on maximum alert since and on
Monday a U.S. military officer wounded a Panamanian police officer
in what he said was self-defense.
   An Associated Press reporter saw 24 U.S. tanks and at least four
trucks carrying American troops head in the direction of Panamanian
Defense Forces headquarters on Tuesday night. Troops in olive
uniforms ran through the luxury Marriott Hotel and lights in the
hotel went out.
   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,
issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement by
unauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.
   The roar of planes and helicopters were heard over the city.
   Earlier Tuesday, Panama accused the U.S. forces of violating its
air space with ``observation planes and helicopters'' in
preparation for military action.
   Frequent movements of U.S. soldiers and equipment have been seen
within U.S. military installations the past three days, and
appeared to escalate Tuesday at Howard Air Force Base. About 12,000
American soldiers are stationed along the Panama Canal.
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega, who controls the
Panamanian military and the country, since he was indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   U.S. sanctions have depressed the economy, but have not budged
Noriega, and two coup attempts _ most recently in October _ failed
to unseat him.
   An NBC News broadcast Tuesday showed what it said were C-141
Starlifter transport planes landing in Panama in the afternoon. It
said one plane was landing every 10 minutes and that security had
been tightened around the air base.
   Later Tuesday, a New York Times reporter and a Reuters reporter
were detained for about an hour by U.S. military police when they
tried to enter Howard air base to determine whether U.S. forces
were landing.
   The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the U.S.
Army, the Times said in New York, and the two reporters were
released without incident.
   An AP reporter who drove through Howard air base Tuesday night
saw at least 10 large transport planes, an unusually high number.
There also were six to eight helicopters parked there, in contrast
to the usual three or four.
   It was not clear what kind of planes they were or whether they
transported troops or cargo.
   A U.S. Southern Command spokesman said earlier Tuesday ``no
unusual military activity'' was taking place. Later he said he knew
nothing about the reported arrival of C-141 planes.
   At Fort Clayton, headquarters of the U.S. Army South, tanks were
pulled into a circle in an open area and troops climbed on and off
them in routine cleaning and exercises Tuesday afternoon.
   Trucks and armored personnel carriers also were moved into
public view.
   Telephone lines to the Southern Command offices at Quarry
Heights and to officers' homes were busy late Tuesday. Access to
Quarry Heights is limited, but a public road goes through Howard.
   Earlier Tuesday, C-141 planes were seen in the air around Fort
Bragg, N.C., home of the Army's 82nd Airborne division. It was not
known if they were connected to any U.S. military activity in
Panama.
   Fort Bragg spokesmen would say only that Army units there were
taking part in a routine ``emergency deployment readiness
exercise.'' Sgt. Bobby Feibel, a spokesman for the division, said
he had no information on reports that some of the division had left
Fort Bragg.
   In California, soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division (Light)
were mobilized Monday at Fort Ord Army base, also for a readiness
exercise, said base public affairs officer Jim Davis.
   ``As a matter of policy, we do not address destination, unit
size, unit designation, or times of departure,'' Davis added.
   Lt. Pascual Gonzalez, director of civil aviation, said Panama
has ``a critical situation'' with the United States. ``We think the
level of aggression and intimidation will increase,'' he told The
Associated Press.
   ``There are helicopters flying during the night over our
installations,'' he said.
   At the State Department in Washington, spokeswoman Margaret
Tutwiler said Noriega's declaration last week that a state of war
existed with the United States, followed by ``indiscriminate and
unprovoked violence against Americans, clearly increases tensions
in Panma.''
   Ms. Tutwiler would not say what contingencies or options were
under consideration.
   Panamanian officials say the American officer was killed when he
and three others drove a car past checkpoints, then fired at
Noriega's military headquarters building, wounding two civilians
and a soldier.
   The United States says the four were unarmed, in civilian
clothes, when they got lost near the headquarters.
   Lt. Robert Paz, 25, who had been in Panama since September, was
killed when the group fled civilians and soldiers who tried to
force them from their car at the checkpoint, Southern Command said.
   On Monday, a U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian police
corporal because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon,
according to Southern Command.
   Police Cpl. Cesar Tejada, who was shot once in the left arm,
told journalists permitted to interview him in a hospital Tuesday
the American had initiated the incident.
   ``I was merely standing there, doing my job, when this car went
by at high speed and the driver fired two shots at me,'' he said.
``I never gave him a reason for it.''
   Journalists also were permitted to interview another patient,
Alex Correa, who said he belonged to the security detail at
military headquarters. Correa said he was shot in the arm Saturday
by the Americans.
   Southern Command officials have said repeatedly the only
shooting was by Panamanian troops.
   Noriega has denied the drug charges.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchage reversed
its early downswing and edged up Wednesday, while the dollar firmed
against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.80 yen. It started trading at 143.92 yen and ranged
between 143.90 yen and 144.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues regained 72.90
points, or 0.19 percent, ending the day at 38,512.00. It lost
147.08 points Tuesday on rumors the Bank of Japan might raise the
nation's discount rate by the weekend.
   Market players, however, avoided making major moves amid
uncertainties over the discount-rate increase, said Tomoyuki
Morimoto, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co.
   ``Many market players were reluctant to make major moves amid
uncertainty over the discount rate hike,'' he said. ``Few people
will be inclined to buy further until they find out what exactly
will happen to the rate.''
   Higher interest rates discourage stock investment.
   News reports speculated the Bank of Japan might raise its key
lending rate to commercial banks by 0.5 percentage point to 4.25
percent, but both the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan denied
the hike would happen any time soon.
   Kyodo News Service reported Wednesday the central bank will
begin negotiations with the government in an attempt to raise the
discount rate soon, citing sources from within the Bank of Japan.
   In currency dealings, trading was quiet in the absence of fresh
market-affecting news ahead of the Christmas holiday, traders said.
   ``Although the market was hectic yesterday due to the rumor
about the discount rate, it no longer has any impact here. The
market already expects there will be a hike sometime early next
year,'' said a trader with Mitsubishi Bank, speaking on condition
of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King is
supporting a plan under which the government early next year would
mail monthly refunds to millions of elderly people overcharged for
Medicare premiums.
   If the plan goes through, Social Security beneficiaries who
unavoidably will be overcharged by about $5.30 a month for their
Medicare coverage early in 1990 will be simultaneously issued
monthly refund checks.
   The overcharges are the result of Congress' late action in
repealing Medicare's catastrophic health-care program. Social
Security contends its computers can't be adjusted by January to
halt withholding of the extra Medicare premium for catastrophic
coverage.
   As a result, nearly 27 million Social Security beneficiaries who
have Medicare premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks
are expected to be overcharged from January through May.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King said Tuesday a panel
of experts convened by the agency to study the problem suggested
issuing monthly or bimonthly refund checks to offset the
overcharges, or sending out lump-sum refunds late in the spring.
   Mrs. King said the Treasury Department, which actually issues
Social Security checks, reported that lump-sum refunds were the
most feasible option and that monthly refund checks would be ``much
worse than the other two scenarios.''
   However, Mrs. King said Treasury did not expressly rule out the
possibility of mailing monthly refunds, so she will ``send back a
signal that that would be our preferred option.'' She said she
would ask Treasury to advise her on whether it can provide monthly
checks.
   ``That option ... appears to be the best way to get money back
as quickly as possible,'' Mrs. King said in an interview. ``My
purpose has been to try to make the beneficiaries whole. They
should not have to pay for this problem. The question is how can we
get them this money.''
   Andy Montgomery, a spokesman for Treasury's Bureau of Financial
Management Services, said the agency has been meeting with Social
Security ``to identify the most expeditious way to achieve the
refunds. At this particular point, nothing has been decided.''
   Social Security initially had said it probably would issue the
refunds in lump sums late in the spring. Mrs. King's statement that
she would push for monthly refunds came on the same day that two
congressmen sent President Bush a letter asking him to support that
option.
   Reps. David Bonior, D-Mich., and Robert Wise, D-W.Va., said
retirees should not have to pay _ even temporarily _ for a program
that won't exist next year.
   ``For seniors, this isn't just a matter of principle _ it's a
matter of meeting rent payments, buying food and paying
utilities,'' Bonior said.
   Bonior said the General Accounting Office estimated the cost of
issuing monthly refunds at $25 million to $30 million, and said the
first refund checks could be in the mail by February.
   Mrs. King said each extra monthly mailing would cost about $10
million.

<HEAD>Many Long Distance Phone Rates to Drop in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many long distance telephone rates to points
in the United States and abroad will be going down after the first
of the year, the three major long distance companies say.
   American Telephone and Telegraph Co. filed reductions with the
Federal Communications Commission Tuesday. MCI Communications Corp.
and U.S. Sprint said they will take action to remain competitive.
   AT&amp;T says it has about 70 percent of the long distance market,
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues. MCI is No. 2
with more than 10 percent. U.S. Sprint claims 7 to 8 percent.
   The AT&amp;T reductions will take effect Jan. 1, barring an unusual
action by the FCC to block them.
   The company said the reductions were taken in line with an FCC
price cap which has been reduced because local telephone companies
are charging long distance companies less for access to customers'
lines.
   AT&amp;T's submission to the FCC called for $300 million a year in
reductions on interstate and international long distance services
used primarily by residential and small business customers. Other
categories of service used by businesses, such as private lines and
800 and 900 numbers, are not affected.
   MCI spokesman John Hauser said the No. 2 long distance company
also will reduce its rates to pass on the savings in local
telephone company charges. ``We will remain competitive with
them,'' he said. ``I don't know how much our total cost savings
will be.''
   Hauser's counterpart at U.S. Sprint, Robin Pence, said, ``We are
reviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive.''
   The company said price reductions will apply to its ``Reach Out
America'' and optional long distance plans as well as to basic long
distance service.
   A 10-minute call during daytime hours on a weekday, to anywhere
in the United States, will cost $2.50 or less, a decrease of 1.3
percent on the average, the company said. Some of the increases
would be greater. For example, a 10-minute daytime call from
Washington to New York, which now costs $2.30, would decline to
$2.20. Daytime hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. local time Monday through
Friday.
   In the evening, the rate for a call to anywhere in the United
States will drop by an average of 2 percent, the company said. An
evening call from Washington to San Francisco, Los Angeles or
Dallas, which now costs $1.67 for 10 minutes, would be $1.58. The
evening period is 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Sunday through Friday.
   Weekend rates are in effect all day Saturday and until 5 p.m. on
Sunday and the same rates apply from 11 p.m. to 8 a.m. Sunday
through Friday. These rates will not change. The maximum for such a
call is $1.32 for 10 minutes within the United States, the company
said.
   Discounts for subscribers to the Reach Out America 24-hour plan
will be increased from 5 percent to 10 percent on weekday calls and
from 20 to 25 percent on evening calls. Under Reach Out America,
the evening period is 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Friday.
   International calls from the U.S. mainland to 25 of the most
frequently called countries and overseas areas will be slashed by
$104 million. The reductions will vary from country to country and
the countries will include Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United
Kingdom, France, Italy, Israel, Brazil, Australia, the Philippines,
Taiwan and Korea.
   A five-minute call from anywhere in the United States to Japan
between 2 and 8 p.m., now $8.72 at the standard rate prevailing in
those hours, will drop to $8.07. A similar call to Britain between
1 and 6 p.m., when discount rates are in effect for such calls,
will decline from $4.21 to $3.99. Calls to Mexico will decline from
2 to 20 percent, depending on the time and the city from which the
call is placed. A five-minute call from New York to Cancun, now
$7.90 at the standard rate, will drop to $5.90. Five minutes from
Los Angeles to Mexico City, now $6.15, will cost $5.55.
   AT&amp;T said the reduction will be the company's 10th since 1984
and would bring total rate decreases to 40 percent in the six years
since the breakup of the Bell System.

   President Bush's secret dealings with the
repressive government in Beijing suggest a double standard in the
way the administration views China and the rest of the world in
terms of human rights and aspirations for democracy.
   With the Soviet Union, for example, the United States demands
that human rights stand as a centerpiece of the superpower
relationship.
   Yet with China, Bush is moving to resume business with its
aging, hardline leaders even though they remain doggedly
unrepentant about the June massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators
and continue to suppress their citizens.
   On Tuesday, Bush approved the export of three communications
satellites expected to be launched by China, and he moved to end a
ban that kept the U.S. Export-Import Bank from aiding companies
doing business with China.
   Winston Lord, the U.S. ambassador to China until last April,
says the United States would not have reversed course so swiftly if
the killings had occurred in Eastern Europe.
   Breaking with the administration because of its secret
diplomatic missions to Beijing, Lord said the U.S. overtures were a
sign of ``cultural, if not racial, bias.''
   Bush has been an outspoken champion of democratic reforms that
are toppling hardline communist regimes from power in Eastern
Europe.
   Along those lines, the White House on Tuesday denounced the
``systematic denial of human rights'' in Romania and called on its
government to cease the ``brutal repression'' that some witnesses
say has left hundreds dead.
   It is a message that could be aimed just as easily at China.
However, Bush has muted his criticism of Beijing and he only
reluctantly accepted sanctions imposed by Congress against China.
   An old China hand, Bush has taken the position he knows better
than his critics. It's hard to judge exactly what Bush is doing
since he refuses to talk about it publicly.
   ``You see,'' Bush explained to reporters, ``I still believe that
sometimes to effect change, you talk in confidence to people.''
   He insists his secret dealings do not amount to condoning the
repression in China. ``That is not a good rap and it is not true,''
Bush said.
   As for the secrecy of Bush's actions, White House press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater says the president's conduct of foreign
relations ``will, from time to time, involve him in making trips,
making contacts, talking to people and keeping it secret.''
   The administration's actions have sharpened tensions between the
White House and Congress on foreign policy and are sure to be an
issue of contention when lawmakers return to Washington.
   There probably will be congressional hearings on U.S. policy
toward China.
   The flash point of dispute is the two secret missions to China
by presidential emissaries Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national
security adviser, and Lawrence Eagleburger, his deputy secretary of
state.
   Reluctantly, the White House revealed that Scowcroft and
Eagleburger had traveled to Beijing barely a month after the
crackdown. The purpose, Fitzwater said, was to tell Chinese leaders
face to face that the United States found their conduct
unacceptable.
   The news provided fresh ammunition for opponents of Bush's
policies.
   ``To have sent two of our highest level officials to Beijing
only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the
president look like a wimp in Beijing and a hypocrite in
Washington,'' said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, demanded that
the administration make a full disclosure of its contact with China.
   Even before disclosure of the July trip, Democrats were up in
arms about an announced visit by Scowcroft and Eagleburger to China
in December.
   Toasting Chinese leaders with words approved by Bush, Scowcroft
said the United States wanted to bring ``new impetus and vigor'' to
the relationship.
   In language soothing to the Chinese government, Scowcroft said,
``In both our societies, there are voices of those who seek to
redirect or frustrate our cooperation. We both must take bold
measures to overcome these negative forces.''
   Fitzwater, asked to identify the negative forces in the United
States, said Tuesday, ``I don't know.'' He suggested that the
question should be directed to Scowcroft.

<HEAD>North's Testimony in Poindexter Trial to be Limited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Restrictions on Oliver L. North's testimony
will make it more difficult to prosecute John Poindexter, says a
former chief counsel to the congressional Iran-Contra committees.
   U.S. District Court Judge Harold Greene ruled Tuesday that
North's statements at his own trial are off-limits for use in the
Poindexter case.
   North testified in April that he saw the former national
security adviser tear up a presidential finding retroactively
legalizing CIA assistance for a November 1985 shipment of Hawk
missiles to Iran.
   But North testified last week that his recollection on that and
other matters was influenced by Poindexter's immunized appearance
on Capitol Hill in 1987. Therefore, said Greene, North's trial
testimony as it relates to Poindexter may not be used, unless it
was a subject which Poindexter didn't address in his immunized
testimony.
   The court's obligations require it to ``err on the side of
protecting Poindexter's constitutional right not to be convicted
with the use of his own testimony,'' said the judge.
   Prosecutors ``may only elicit evidence'' from North based on his
statements prior to July 15, 1987, the day Poindexter began
testifying on Capitol Hill, said the judge.
   By saying he was tainted, North ``has snaked his way around''
the issue of having to testify about the finding being torn up,
said John Nields, former chief counsel to the House majority staff
in the congressional Iran-Contra hearings.
   Since North did not tell the congressional committees in 1987
that he saw Poindexter destroy the finding, he ``won't be able to
testify to it at the (Poindexter) trial'' and ``I don't think the
government has any other proof of it,'' said Nields.
   The government still could elicit information about the
finding's being torn up if Poindexter decides to testify in his own
behalf at his trial, which is scheduled to begin Jan. 22.
   The destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal
charges against the former national security adviser. He is accused
of conspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of
making false statements.
   Poindexter destroyed the December 1985 finding on Nov. 21, 1986,
the same day he allegedly told Congress that no one in the U.S.
government knew until early 1986 that the shipment had carried Hawk
missiles.
   The prosecution says the finding which Poindexter destroyed is
``the most critical document in proving the falsity'' of another
document, a chronology which is an essential part of the
government's case against Poindexter. The chronology contains the
same false information which Poindexter allegedly gave to Congress
_ that no one in the government knew about the Hawk shipment until
1986.
   Paul Thompson, the National Security Council's legal counsel,
was present when Poindexter tore up the finding.
   But Thompson said in a deposition to Congress in August 1987
that he didn't realize at the time it was the finding that
Poindexter was destroying.
   ``One document we came to he ripped up ... saying `This is no
longer necessary' or `this has no future,''' Thompson recalled in
his deposition to Congress. ``That document turns out to have been
the finding.'' Thompson said he learned it was the finding when he
saw Poindexter admit it on television in his immunized testimony.
   North was convicted in May of three felonies in the Iran-Contra
affair. He is appealing the convictions on charges of altering and
destroying documents, accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and
abetting an obstruction of Congress.
   The obstruction charge was related to a November 1985 shipment
of Hawks to Iran, which also forms the basis of some of the charges
in the Poindexter case.

<TEXT>
   Socialist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva
conceded defeat in the presidential election, but he accused
conservative victor Fernando Collor de Mello of deception and
pledged to build an opposition ``shadow government.''
   Election officials announced Tuesday that Collor de Mello, a
champion of free-market policies, had won Sunday's balloting.
   ``Fernando Collor de Mello is the winner and that must be
respected. But Brazil was the big loser in the election, gained
through lies and falsehoods,'' da Silva told a news conference in
Sao Paulo.
   ``He will govern in favor of big business, the armed forces, and
the International Monetary Fund,'' de Silva said. ``The Workers
Party and its allies will form a shadow government to prevent
Collor de Mello from committing abuses.''
   With 96.7 percent of the ballots tallied, Collor de Mello of the
National Reconstruction Party had 33,898,190 votes, or 42.7
percent, compared with 30,546,337, or 38.5 percent, for da Silva of
the Workers Party. The rest of the votes were abstentions or
nullified ballots.
   Jose Francisco Rezek, president of the Superior Electoral Court
that was supervising the tally, said Collor de Mello would be
declared the winner Wednesday, but an official announcement would
only be made Dec. 29.
   The election was the first direct vote for president in 29
years. Current president Jose Sarney was selected in an Electoral
College vote strongly influenced by the right-wing military
government that ran the country between 1964 and 1985.
   Collor de Mello has been secluded in his Brasilia mansion. Aides
say he will only address the nation after election officials
proclaim him the winner.
   TV Globo, the nation's largest television network, ran a
previously taped interview with the president-elect Tuesday night
in which Collor de Mello promised a government with ``dignity,
austerity and character.''
   The new president's first challenge will be harnassing inflation
racing at over 1,500 percent this year amid growing poverty.
   Collor de Mello's campaign advisers have told the press he will
seek to heal the wounds from the electoral campaign and call for a
government of ``national unity.''
   However, the wounds run deep.
   In the campaign's final week, Collor de Mello's campaign made
vicious personal attacks on da Silva and said his party wanted to
impose a communist dictatorship in Brazil.
   ``I would never sit at the same table with Collor de Mello. The
low blows he used caused me to lose all respect for him,'' da Silva
said at the Tuesday press conference.
   He said Collor de Mello, scheduled to take office on March 15,
will face strong opposition from labor unions and six leftist
parties.
   During the electoral campaign, Collor de Mello promised to end
inflation, privatize state-run firms, reduce the size of
government, and sell Cabinet minister's mansions to reduce the
public deficit.
   He also won the vote of a great part of the uneducated rural
poor by pledging to increase spending for housing, education and
health care.
   To realize these promises, Collor de Mello must seek allies in
the country's National Congress. The new president's party has 24
senators and representatives, only 3 percent of those in congress.
   Da Silva said his party would back Collor de Mello if he
sincerely attempted to carry out social reforms in this polarized
society, where the richest 1 percent receives almost half the
national income.
   ``But I'm afraid his call for national unity is nothing more
than a trick to keep the working class quiet,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Three days of hearings on President Bush's
nominee to head nuclear weapons production have sharply divided the
Senate panel weighing the nomination, but yielded few signs of
whether he'll be confirmed.
   Victor Stello Jr., nominated as assistant energy secretary for
defense programs last July 24, urged the Senate Armed Services
Committee on Tuesday to act as soon as possible, but the panel is
not expected to vote until January or February.
   Stello appeared before the committee in a first round of
hearings Nov. 15 and 16.
   Three of the 11 Democratic members of the committee _ Sens. John
Glenn of Ohio, Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts and Timothy Wirth of
Colorado _ are strongly opposed to Stello, but most of their
colleagues have not publicly taken a position.
   Among the nine Republican members, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
and others have charged that the Democrats are trying to kill the
nomination by stalling and raising what they say are irrelevant and
unsubstantiated charges about Stello's professional background.
   Stello worked for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and its
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, for 26 years before
going to the Energy Department last summer as a special adviser on
the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant.
   In a separate development Tuesday, the Energy Department
released a report showing that the new operator at Savannah River,
the Westinghouse Savannah River Co., was given $3.9 million in
federal award fees this year despite serious safety lapses,
including two instances of reactor workers sleeping on the job.
   Westinghouse was applauded for making some important
improvements at the plant since it took over last April, but the
department cited numerous ``anomalies,'' including cases of
radiation alarms being deliberately disabled by workers.
   Stello, in a final statement to the Armed Services Committee,
said ``it is our country that is suffering'' because of a
leadership vacuum in the weapons program. He described the weapons
production complex as being in ``a state of disarray.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmound, R-S.C., said Stello is well suited for the
job and that ``the real issue'' is whether opponents of nuclear
weapons will allow confirmation of a man capable of rebuilding the
production complex. Key production plants are shut down for safety
upgrades, and many private groups contend the facilities no longer
are needed for national security.
   Wirth, however, said Stello should be rejected because his
record as a staff member of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was
spotted with evidence that he sometimes put nuclear industry
interests ahead of assuring public safety.
   The department has been without a confirmed head of weapons
production for more than a year.
   Of five former members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission wo
testified Tuesday, three strongly endorsed Stello's nomination and
two raised serious doubts about his suitability.
   Joseph Hendrie, a former chairman of the NRC and currently a
consultant to nuclear utilities, said he has known Stello for 17
years and considers him ``a good manager and a natural leader. I
recommend him to you in the strongest terms.''
   James Asselstine, a commission member from 1982-87, said he has
``very mixed feelings'' about Stello. He called Stello technically
qualified for the Energy Department job, but said Stello at the NRC
sometimes was too easy on those he regulated.
   Asselstine cited as an example a case in which Stello ordered
his staff to rewrite proposed changes in fire protection standards
for nuclear plants to satisfy objections from utilities. Stello
later denied this allegation.

<HEAD>Exported No More, Steam Locomotives Now Arrive from China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steam locomotives built in the Philadelphia
area were exported to railroads around the world years ago. Now,
two companies are importing from China 83-ton locomotives based on
a 1918 American design.
   Two brand-new steam engines were unloaded from a freighter
Sunday at the Beckett Street Terminal in Camden, N.J., for the Knox
&amp; Kane Railroad in northwestern Pennsylvania and the Valley
Railroad in Essex, Conn.
   New steam locomotives haven't been seen in this port since the
1950s, when the old Baldwin Locomotive Works went out of business.
   It's been decades since efficient diesel locomotives made steam
power obsolete on U.S. railroads, but steam engines have survived
on short lines hauling tourists.
   Thousands of people visiting scenic and historic sites line up
each year to ride on old-time trains, but even something as
heavy-duty as a locomotive eventually wears out.
   ``The repairs we found necessary on our existing locomotives got
the railroads thinking about new locomotives,'' said J. David
Conrad of the Valley Railroad, as he waited for the new steam
engine at the marine terminal.
   The last place in the world that still makes steam engines is
the Tangshan Locomotive &amp; Rolling Stock Works, about 140 miles east
of Beijing. The Chinese still rely on steam locomotives because of
their sturdiness, and because China has plenty of manpower and coal
required by the old locomotives.
   Conrad went to the Chinese in 1986 to arrange a sale and soon
afterward, the Knox &amp; Kane followed suit.
   Sloan Cornell, the Knox &amp; Kane general manager, said the new
engine would haul tourists through part of the Allegheny National
Forest.
   The main attraction of the Knox &amp; Kane is the 300-foot-high,
2,053-foot-long Kinzua Bridge, the highest in the world when it was
built. About 17,000 people rode the Knox &amp; Kane in 1988.
   The Valley Railroad carries about 130,000 passengers a year on
its six-mile trip along the west shore of the Connecticut River
from Essex to Chester, Conn.
   Valley Railroad President Lynn Parrott said the $300,000 price
for the new locomotive was worth it.
   A delegation from Valley visited three locomotive factories in
China and decided on the Class SY from Tangshan (SY stands for
Shang You, Chinese characters meaning ``Aiming High,'' according to
Valley).
   Similar engines built in the United States for export to Japan
early this century were nicknamed ``Mikados.''
   Conrad said Valley preferred the smaller model over a larger
locomotive from a plant in Datong. He and his assistants also
preferred Tangshan's construction methods and the willingness of
the Tangshan engineering staff to American boiler codes and
railroad guidelines.
   When the new Chinese locomotive finally arrives in Connecticut,
Ms. Parrott said it will be their primary engine. She doubted that
passengers would mind the locomotive was not an antique.
   ``The majority of people who come here just like to ride behind
a steam engine,'' she said. ``Besides, the engine being new and
coming from China may arouse some curiosity.''
   After clearing customs, the locomotives are to be towed or
hauled on flatcars by Conrail to their new owners.

   Responding to congressional unrest over U.S.
policy toward El Salvador, Bush administration officials say
American aid to that country is yielding substantial benefits in
battlefield performance and in protection of human rights.
   A senior administration official who briefed reporters on
Tuesday said leftist rebels were ``sadly mistaken'' when they
assumed that the uprising they launched six weeks ago would produce
a popular uprising.
   In addition, the official said, the armed forces are showing an
increasing sensitivity to human rights concerns and, contrary to
popular wisdom, there has not been a resurgence of rightist death
squad activity.
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, expressing skepticism about the
wisdom of U.S. policy, asked the General Accounting Office on
Tuesday to determine if U.S. military aid has been used effectively
in El Salvador's long battle against the rebels.
   Kennedy, D-Mass., said the results of the GAO investigation will
form the background of a congressional review early next year of
U.S. policy toward El Salvador.
   The effectiveness of the large and continuing U.S. aid program
is called into question by the strong rebel offensive mounted
against Salvadoran government forces last month, Kennedy said.
   The United States has provided El Salvador with well over $3
billion in economic and military aid over the past decade.
   Kennedy said he also wants to know if U.S. military personnel
inside El Salvador have any knowledge of the activities of
right-wing death squads and whether they are required to disclose
such information.
   A report issued over the weekend by Americas Watch, a New
York-based human rights organization, said rights violations in El
Salvador have been occurring at a ``breathtaking pace'' since the
rebel offensive began. The report documents abuses by both
government and rebel forces.
   The U.S. official, who briefed reporters on the condition that
he not be identified, said the number of unexplained deaths, after
a dramatic decline in the early 1980's, is still ``marginally
down'' despite occasional ``blips.''
   He said there is no hard evidence of a resurgence of death squad
activities either as the result of the victory by the rightist
party last March or of the offensive begun last month by the FMLN
rebels.
   ``The offensive is falling apart,'' the official said, asserting
that the rebels now are facing food and medicine shortages.
   He estimated that perhaps half of the rebel force of about 8,000
has been lost as a result of death, wounding, capture or desertions.
   The official said there is no conclusive evidence implicating
either the military or leftist forces in the unsolved murder of six
Jesuit priests in El Salvador last month.
   But Rep. Joe Moakley, D-Mass., a member of a special House panel
investigating the murders, said Tuesday there is circumstantial
evidence to implicate the Salvadoran military.
   Moakley said this is the case despite the fact that during a
week of questioning by the FBI, a Salvadoran woman, Mrs. Lucia
Barrera de Cerna, withdrew her story that the night of the murders
she saw armed men in military uniform near the priests' residence,
heard their voices and heard heavy gunfire.
   This change in the woman's testimony did not justify claims by
Salvadoran officials that Mrs. Barrera's testimony has been
discredited, thus proving that Salvadoran armed forces were not
involved in the murders, Moakley said.
   ``There is other circumstantial evidence to implicate the
military,'' Moakley said.
   He said Mrs. Barrera repeated her original story to members of
the special committee, declaring she had felt ``pressured'' to say
she had actually seen nothing that night after her FBI
interrogators made it evident they did not believe her.
   ``She did change her story at that time but told us that she did
so only to end the questioning of her,'' Moakley said.
   The State Department has denied ``absolutely and unequivocally''
allegations that she was mistreated during her interrogation.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Pentagon Considering Big Troop Cuts In Pacific</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense planners are suggesting a possible
two-thirds reduction in U.S. Army forces in South Korea as part of
proposed drastic cuts in U.S. troop strength in the Pacific, The
Washington Post reported today.
   The options for troop cuts were presented to Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, in a meeting Monday at the Pentagon, the Post reported,
citing unidentified sources.
   No decisions have been made on the proposals, the newspaper said.
   Maj. David Super, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said he knew
nothing about the meeting reported by the newspaper.
   Overall in the Pacific, the maximum amount of cuts contemplated
in the Pentagon briefing paper given to Cheney would mean a
reduction of 80,000 people from the Army and Air Force by the end
of the 1994 fiscal year for a savings of $3.6 billion, the
newspaper reported.
   Currently the Army has 32,052 people stationed in South Korea
and options presented to Cheney would cut that to a 5,200-person
brigade and another 6,550 in support, the newspaper said.

<HEAD>Construction Companies Pay in Bid-Rigging Settlement</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is being paid $32.7
million by 99 Japanese companies to settle bid-rigging charges that
officials say raised construction costs of a U.S. Navy base by 25
percent.
   The cartel of 140 companies had bid on construction of the base
at Yokosuka, the Justice Department said Tuesday.
   Japan's Fair Trade Commission, which administers that country's
antitrust laws, earlier had fined 69 companies 1.5 percent of the
value of each company's contract, for a total of $2.2 million, and
had warned 70 unsuccessful bidders not to continue in the
bid-rigging arrangement.
   Some companies offered to negotiate a settlement as a result of
threats of a U.S. government lawsuit in the Japanese courts and
also in the U.S. courts against 26 companies also doing business in
the United States, the department said. The settlement, which
involved 99 firms, was negotiated in November, the agency said.
   Japanese construction companies frequently collaborate on bids
in a system called ``dango'' where the bidders decide who gets the
winning bid. The 140 companies bidding for U.S. Navy contracts at
Yokosuka formed an association in 1984 that called itself
``Seiyukai,'' or ``Friends of the Stars,'' a reference to the
American flag.
   The association dissolved in 1987 when the companies became
aware that they were under investigation by the Navy.
   Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general in charge of the
civil division of the department, said the U.S. government would
pursue ``available remedies,'' including possible lawsuits in
Japan, the United States or both countries, against construction
companies that did not join the settlement.
   ``We are pleased to have been able to reach a just result
through the Japanese legal process,'' Gerson said.

   The unrest in Romania may be the beginning of
the end for strongman Nicolae Ceausescu, who was hailed 24 years
ago as a Soviet bloc maverick but is increasingly denounced for his
repressive policies.
   ``We are definitely in the twilight of the Ceausescu era,'' said
F. Stephen Larabee, vice president of the Institute for East-West
Security Studies in New York.
   The Soviet foreign minister and the White House both condemned
Ceausescu's use of violence to crush demonstrations in the Romanian
city of Timisoara, where according to some reports as many as 400
people died.
   But Ceausescu, who has ruled Romania with an iron hand since
1965, ``is going to be a harder nut to crack'' than communist
leaders swept from power in the Soviet bloc nations of Poland, East
Germany, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria, said James Brown, a
specialist in East European affairs at the RAND Corp. in Los
Angeles.
   Romania has been a maverick in the Soviet camp for decades _
boycotting Warsaw Pact exercises, trading with the West against
Kremlin wishes and most recently balking at the democratic reforms
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Although Ceausescu may be able to survive in the short term, his
days seem numbered, said Larabee, Brown and other analysts.
   ``This incident or some other might open up an explosion of
popular dissent, or some group in the leadership, such as the
military, may decide to get rid of him. Sometime or another,
something has to give,'' said Raymond Garthoff, a former U.S.
ambassador to Bulgaria and now a senior scholar at the Brookings
Institution in Washington.
   The current unrest in Romania began as a reaction to repressions
against the Hungarian minority in the nearby cities of Timisoara
and Arad, along with the more distant city of Brasov, but reports
indicate that ethnic Romanians may have joined the demonstrations.
Experts say that is bad news for Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu was once a favorite of U.S. leaders because he refused
to allow Romanian troops to join Warsaw Pact military maneuvers,
was the only Soviet bloc leader to maintain full relations with
Israel and traded with Western nations against the wishes of
Moscow. In 1969, then-President Richard Nixon went to Romania in
the first U.S. state visit to a Soviet bloc nation.
   Ceausesu's widely reported human rights abuses chilled
U.S.-Romanian relations, however, and the United States last year
withdrew trade favors from Romania, costing that nation as much as
$250 million annually.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater harshly criticized
Romania on Tuesday.
   ``The United States condemns the brutal use of police force by
the Romanian government against protesters in Timisoara and other
cities,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze said that if the
reports of bloodshed were true, ``I can only express my very
profound regret. We are categorically opposed to the use of force.''
   Romania has been a maverick since the late 1950s when
Ceausescu's predecessor rejected a Kremlin plan to more closely
integrate the Romanian economy into Soviet bloc by selling Moscow
and its allies oil and other natural resources. Instead, the
Romanians sold their oil to the West and used the money to
industrialize.
   Ceausescu became party leader in 1965 and refused to allow
Romanian forces to take part in Warsaw Pact exercises.
   He was the only Warsaw Pact leader to refuse to take part in the
1968 Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. He denounced the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 and refused to join the Soviet bloc
boycott of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles.
   Throughout that period, the Romanians took advantage of the
Sino-Soviet dispute, playing Moscow off against Beijing. As reforms
have swept Eastern Europe, Ceausescu has kept close ties with
conservatives in Beijing and counts as his closest allies hardline
communist leaders in China, North Korea and Cuba, Brown said.

   Here is the text of the statement by White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater announced early Wednesday
that President Bush had ordered American troops in Panama to seize
dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The president has directed U.S. forces to execute at 1 a.m. this
morning pre-planned missions in Panama to protect American lives,
restore the democratic process, preserve the integrity of the
Panama Canal treaties and apprehend Manuel Noriega
   The situation in Panama under Gen. Noriega has reached a crisis.
Democratic elections have been thwarted; American lives have been
endangered.
   The integrity of the Panama Canal treaties is at risk.
   Gen. Noriega is under indictment for drug-related charges and
the president has made every effort peacefully to resolve the
situation through negotiations under the auspices of the
Organization of American States and Latin American leaders.
   Gen. Noriega has rejected all of these efforts. Last Friday,
Noriega declared a state of war with the United States. The next
day the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) shot to death an unarmed
American serviceman, wounded another, seized and beat another
serviceman and sexually threatened his wife.
   Under these circumstances, the president decided he must act to
prevent further violence. Our troops will use only the force
necessary to achieve the objectives and will be withdrawn as
quickly as possible.
   At approximately midnight tonight, the democratically elected
leaders of Panama, President Endara, and vice presidents Calderon
and Ford, were sworn in and assumed their rightful positions. They
welcome and support our actions and have stated their intention to
institute a Democratic government immediately.
   The United States has recognized that government and will
restore normal relations and will cooperate to rebuild a free and
prosperous Panama.

   Here are details of the nine Superfund
cleanups announced by the Environmental Protection Agency.
   _The F.T. Rose Disposal Pit in Lanesborough, Mass., contaminated
by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and various volatile organic
compounds. The General Electric Co., the only known generator of
the contaminants, agreed to pay for a thermal cleanup process in
which the hazardous materials will be extracted through
evaporation, then incinerated. The process is estimated to cost the
company $6.45 million. In addition, GE will reimburse the
government $494,000 for costs already incurred.
   _The Old Springfield Landfill, Springfield, Vt., operated as a
27-acre garbage and industrial waste dump from 1948 to 1968, and
upon which a mobile home park was built in 1970. Park residents, of
whom few remain, complained of bad odors in their well water, and
EPA investigators found it contamined with organic compounds.
Browning-Ferris Industries of Vermont, Inc., Emhart Industries,
Inc., Textron, Inc., and the town of Springfield will share costs,
estimated at $5.4 million, for a groundwater extraction and
treatment system, and will repay the EPA $1.75 million for past
costs.
   _The Yaworski Lagoon at Canterbury, Conn., where industrial
wastes including solvents, paints, textile dyes, acid and resins
were dumped between 1950 and 1973. Pervel Industries, Revere
Textile Prints, InterRoyal Corp., Triangle PWC, Inc., the Rogers
Corp., Kaman Aerospace Corp., and C &amp; M Corp. will share the
estimated $3.4 million costs for surface cleanup and a cap and
diking system, and will repay the government $2.25 million.
   _Reich Farm, a three-acre disposal site in Dover Township, N.J.,
where approximately 4,500 drums containing industrial waste from
Union Carbide's Bound Brook plant were dumped. Union Carbide will
pay an estimated $5.8 million to extract contaminated groundwater
and excavate and treat contaminated soil, and will repay $1.67
million to the government.
   _Limestone Road site, an industrial dump about 2.5 miles west of
Cumberland, Md., where contamination by chromium, cadmium, lead and
organic solvents threatens area groundwater. Fairchild Industries
and the Cumberland Cement and Supply Co. will pay an estimated $3
million to grade the site, cap the contaminated soil and fence off
the area. The EPA and the state of Maryland, meanwhile, reserve the
right to pursue additional remedies if groundwater contamination is
found.
   _Miami County Incinerator, in Troy, Ohio, and just 1500 feet
west of the Great Miami River, where non-cumbustible solid wastes
were landfilled and where industrial liquid wastes were dumped into
an unlined pit from 1968 through the mid-1970s. A large number of
chemical contaminants, included 30 probable or possible
cancer-causing agents, have been detected at the site. Nearly 50
companies and 22 local governments will share the cost of a $20
million cleanup, including construction of an alternate water
supply for well-water users in the area.
   _The Pristine, Inc., site at Reading, Ohio, a Cincinnati suburb,
where liquid wastes including pesticides, PCBs, acids and solvents
were dumped from November 1974 to September 1981. A total of 111
companies, including Eli Lilly, General Electric, IBM, Monsanto,
Union Carbide and Westinghouse entered into the settlement.
Thirty-eight will share a $13.5 million cleanup program involving
incineration of the top foot of soil, extraction of contaminated
groundwater, and demolition of on-site structures. All 111 firms
will share payments to the government of nearly $5 million.
   _Dutchtown Oil Treatment Facility, in Dutchtown, La., a
five-acre site operated from 1965 to 1982 as a waste oil refinery,
and where hazardous wastes were dumped in to unlined pits.
Twenty-one firms, including Bethlehem Steel, Exxon Corp., Mobil
Oil, and Kaiser Aluminum will share a $6 million cleanup involving
incineration of sludges, excavation and treatment of the soil, and
backfilling the pits.
   _Lawrence Todtz site in Camanche, Iowa, where the Du Pont Co.
dumped an estimated 4,300 tons of cellophane processing wastes at a
2.7-acre impoundment between 1971 and 1975. The EPA said it found
groundwater at the site contaminated by arsenic, lead, benzene and
other chemicals. Du Pont agreed to a $5.9 million cleanup, and will
reimburse the government $450,000 for past costs.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who once called
his opponent's bullets ``kisses,'' has been a shrewd and ruthless
survivor who reveled in power and in thumbing his nose at what he
called ``the colossus of the North.''
   At about midnight Tuesday, U.S. forces bent on toppling the
military strongman engaged Panamanian troops less than a week after
his rubber-stamp assembly named him head of state and declared a
``state of war'' with the United States.
   Noriega had eliminated political opposition, nullified the May 7
elections when they were going against him and repeatedly defied
the United States, which indicted him on drug trafficking charges
in February 1988.
   It had long been known that ``Tony'' Noriega enjoyed a crisis
and it was widely said that he would prefer death to losing power.
   Noriega, who comes from El Chorrillo, the Panama City district
where Defense Forces headquarters is located, has survived and
created a mystique that won him the nickname ``The Man,'' the
English word his initials spell.
   Noriega wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it was part of
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the
Panama Canal. Under an accord with the United States, Panama is to
take over the canal by the year 2000.
   Noriega claimed his enemies were plotting to abrogate the canal
pact.
   On Oct. 3, elements of the 15,000-man Defense Forces he
commanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him, but troops
loyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally accepted
the rebels' surrender.
   During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped his
candidate the annulled presidential elections, Noriega was seen
standing alone before the tomb of his patron, Gen. Omar Torrijos.
   The epitaph on the tomb is: ``I don't want to enter heaven. I
just want to enter the Canal Zone.''
   Torrijos, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accord
with former President Carter to turn over the canal. Torrijos died
in a plane crash in 1981, and Noriega became commander of the
Defense Forces in 1983, giving him de facto control of the
government.
   Noriega was raised by foster parents and joined the Defense
Forces in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention of
Torrijos, then an ambitious young officer.
   In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the CIA to
Colombian cocaine cartels.
   Less than a year after Torrijos took power in 1968 coup, he made
Noriega, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rank
of lieutenant colonel.
   It was like having the keys to the city. Noriega immediately
began compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in Panama. The job
also gave him close contact with U.S. intelligence agencies, and he
formed powerful alliances.
   One U.S. official who dealt with Noriega at the time, on drug
enforcement efforts, said Noriega was polite but when it came to
something he wanted, he was ``the coldest man I ever met.''
   After Noriega became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired a
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood.
   His financial interests reportedly included a vast array of
businesses including hotels, casinos, a television station, radio
stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and
prostitution.
   Rumors about his personal life were plentiful, but there were
few facts. Even his age was disputed. The general has said he is
51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54.
   He is married and has a daughter who lives in the Dominican
Republic.
   Although his private life is that of a rich man, he worked hard
to develop a populist image modeled on the revered Torrijos,
spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in
this nation of 2.2 million.
   Noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his
domestic opponents as rich and white. ``The humble, the poor and
the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the people,'' he once
said.
   As the standoff with the United States dragged on, Noriega
enjoyed underlining what he termed Washington's helplessness,
despite the 12,000 troops it has stationed in Panama.
   Noriega exercised power with ruthless assurance. He closed
newspapers for months at a time, and presidents served at his
pleasure.
   Rumors of opposition inside the Defense Forces were met with
purges and reorganizations. ``Kisses,'' was how he described the
bullets fired in an attempted coup in March 1988.
   The United States, long his ally, began to distance itself after
the headless body of one of his opponents, Hugo Spadadora, was
found in a U.S. mailbag in Costa Rica in 1985.
   A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grand
juries in Florida indicted Noriega on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges.
   The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against
Noriega and Washington imposed crippling economic sanctions.
   Noriega didn't budge.
   Noriega, through his control of the Defense Forces, was named
chief of government on Dec. 15 by a rubber-stamp assembly. It said
his leadership was needed to confront a ``state of war'' caused by
U.S. economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general.
   He claims Washington wants to oust him to make it easier for the
United States to renege on the Panama Canal treaties.
   Shortly after the indictments in Floria, Noriega delivered a
speech. He brandished a machete above his head, then brought it
crashing down on the podium.
   ``Not one step back!'' he shouted.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Statehouse races in 18 states will be targeted
next year by Democrats who hope to control state legislatures when
congressional districts are redrawn for the 1990s.
   Democrats will try to raise $3 million to help candidates for
the legislatures in those states next year, Tim Dickson, who heads
the party's Project 500 program, said Tuesday.
   Democrats are particularly concerned with states likely to gain
or lose congressional districts as a result of population shifts
that will come to light in the 1990 census. They are also focusing
on states where the majority's grip in the state legislature is
tenuous.
   The targeted states are Arizona, California, Colorado,
Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, New
Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia,
Washington and Wisconsin.
   Democrats now control 36 state Houses and 32 state Senates,
while Republicans control 12 Houses and 17 Senates. They share
power in Indiana's House; Nebraska has a nonpartisan bicameral
legislature.

<HEAD>Sears, Government Settle Insulation Ads Complaint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has agreed to pay a
$100,000 civil penalty to settle a dispute with the government over
insulation ads, the Federal Trade Commission said.
   The FTC said Sears or its representatives had failed to include
details on the insulation's heat resistance when it promoted the
thickness and price of the product.
   The ads ran within the last five years.
   Chicago-based Sears has agreed to create an advertisement
designed to educate consumers about home insulation, especially the
importance of having heat-resistance information when making a
purchase, the FTC said Tuesday.
   ``The violations were technical in nature and did not result in
any consumer complaints,'' Sears spokesman Gordon Jones said.
``There was no misrepresentation or deception involved.''
   The settlement must be approved by a federal judge in
Washington. The FTC said the consent decree does not constitute
admission of a law violation. The penalty is paid to the
government, not consumers.

<TEXT>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says it's upgrading an investigation of a possible
steering deficiency in the 1988 Chevrolet Beretta.
   The agency also said Tuesday it was beginning probes of reported
explosions in the heating systems of Coachmen Industries
recreational vehicles and of cruise control failures in the Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable.
   The agency said it was stepping up its Beretta probe from a
preliminary evaluation, which involves mostly paperwork, to an
engineering analysis, in which the possibly defective parts are
examined.
   Such investigations can lead to recalls or can be dismissed if
engineers decide there is no widespread safety problem.

   Q. Has Noriega been captured yet?
   A. This operation began at 1 o'clock. The situation on the
ground is such that we are not at liberty a this point to comment
on the military undertaking.
   The operation is ongoing. We don't know how long it will take.
But that is our ultimate objective. It has not happened at this
time.
   Q. On what legal basis was this operation undertaken?
   A. The legal basis was: First of all, the president's
responsibility and duty to protect the lives of American citizens.
We have laid out in the past the number of threats to American
citizens and to U.S. servicemen. There have been literally hundreds
of cases of harassment, of abuse and of situations that have caused
us to believe very greatly that there is a threat to American
citizens, there is a threat to our rights under the canal treaty,
and the president has acted on that basis.
   Q. Was the president acting under intelligence reports that this
operation has a guarantee or a certainty of success?
   A. The certainty of an undertaking like this is something that
we obviously have confidence in. We would not undertake a military
action that we did not believe was well planned and had a high
degree and high chance of success.
   Q. Is this being done in conjunction with any of the Panamanian
Defense Forces? Are any of the Noriega forces joining in the U.S.
effort to oust Noriega?
   A. As I indicated, this operation began just less than a half an
hour ago. There are no indications of those kinds of changes in the
conflict that I can report at this time.
   Q. Was there any planning in conjunction with the Panamanian
Defense Forces or is this solely a U.S. operation?
   A. I can't comment on those kind of planning operations.
   Q. The Organization of American States is urging the president
not to do this. He has gone ahead and done it. Have you talked to
the OAS(Organization of American States)? Have you had any change
of heart from the OAS, any indications of how they're going to feel
about this?
   A. The OAS, as you will recall, considered this matter
considerably following the May elections in Panama. Those
elections, as you also know, were thwarted by Gen. Noriega. All of
America saw the bloody shirt and body of Billy Ford and the others
who were beaten by Gen. Noriega in the aftermath of that election.
And the OAS was very forceful in their consideration of this issue.
And they sent a mission to Panama to try to urge the termination of
the Noriega regime. And they passed a resolution urging that it be
ended by Sept. 1. This evening, President Bush, Vice President
Quayle and Secretary of State Baker are calling various leaders of
Latin American countries, members of the OAS as well as allied
leaders and others. We believe we do have support of the OAS and
the Latin American countries.

   Q. Is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the
Panamanians is scheduled to occur on Jan. 1 have anything to do
with the timing of this operation now?
   A. I don't think is has to do with the timing, but it certainly
has to do with the substance. We do have a responsibilty under the
Panama Canal Treaty for its safety and security, and we do believe
there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty.
And that is one of the aspects of our purpose here.
   Q. Can you give us any details of A, how it's going, B, what the
size of the U.S. force that was amassed for this was and how long
you think this operation might take?
   A. I really can't answer any of those questions in any great
detail. The United States is committing forces we believe are
adequate to the task. It is a major undertaking. There are numbers
of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task. But
I just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of
logistical characterization of the size.
   The president has been considering this matter for several days.
As you all know, he was quite disturbed by the events of last
weekend involving the killing of the United States Marine and the
harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife. The
president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers
on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a plan and
the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action.
Since then there have been any number of meetings. I will not go
into details of when and how they were conducted. But the president
has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since Sunday.
And there really has not been any question about our willingness or
our readiness to proceed since that time.
   Q. What are the troops' orders with regard to Noriega? Were they
ordered to try to take him alive? And if they do, what do you want
them to do with him?
   A. Their orders are to apprhenend Gen. Noriega and our purpose
is to return him to the United States for prosecution under our
laws regarding drug trafficking. Gen. Noriega was indicted in the
southern district of Florida in Miami and the northern district in
Tampa for drug trafficking. And we want to bring him to the United
States for prosecution under that indictment.
   Q. Who swore in Endara, under what legal authority and where is
he now?
   A. I don't know who swore him in. The legal authority of course
was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the May
elections and they are assuming office on that basis.

   Q. Where are they now?
   A. I don't have their exact location.
   Q. Since this is a declaration of war, why didn't the president
come out and announce it himself?
   A. The declaration of war was set by Panama, not by the United
States, so don't get that confused. The president is acting here to
safeguard American lives, to protect the Panama Canal treaty, to
secure the person who is under indictment for drug trafficking. But
the only declaration of war has been on the side of the Panamanians.
   Q. Casualties.
   A. I have no information.
   Q. What's the legal basis here in terms of a declaration of war
... and how had Congress been informed?
   A. We are basing this on the actions outlined in this statement,
which is a pattern of agression in recent days which we think is
quite threatening to American citizens in Panama. There are some
35,000 Americans there as I recall, roughly 35,000 Americans in
Panama _ in a pattern of harassment and threats going back almost a
year that involves literally hundreds of cases. I'll try to provide
you some details on that later. And on the president's strong
feeling that we need to uphold the indictment and to move in this
fashion.
   Q. How has Congress been informed?
   A. The president has telephoned earlier this evening the
leadership of the Congress, Michel, Foley, Mitchell, Dole. Other
members of the Armed Services Committee, Foreign Affairs Committee,
intelligence committees are being called this evening. And they are
all receiving briefings and information on the actions being taken.
   Q. What is their reaction?
   A. Their initial reaction has been supportive. The president has
talked to them briefly, but did outline our purposes in much the
same words that I have used here, and we have only heard support.
   Q. Any final ultimatum, directly or indirectly, to Noriega in
the last few hours?
   A. Our ultimatum is as stated, that we are there to apprehend
him and bring him back to America for prosecution.
   Q. Any attempt to communicate with him or warn him what's going
to happen if you don't quit?
   A. No.
   Q. Where is the president monitoring the events and who is with
him now?
   Q. The president is in the Oval Office and also in his study
which is right off the Oval Office. Governor Sununu has been with
him much of the evening. General Scowcroft has been there much of
the evening. Secretary Baker was there for a short time. Robert
Gates, the deputy national security adviser has convened the
deputies group. He did that earlier this evening. They are meeting
continually through this crisis and will continue to do that. Mr.
Gates is providing minute-by-minute updates as he receives them and
the president is monitoring this through other channels that are
associated with the presence of General Scowcroft.
   Q. The vice president, was he here?
   A. The vice president is here. He is in his office and he is
making phone calls at this time to various world leaders.

   A. I just can't comment on the location of General Noriega or
what we do know about him. That would jeopardize the mission. I
just could not offer any comment.
   Q. What about the question of whether there are strict orders
not to shoot him or injure him, to make sure that he is apprehended
alive?
   A. The orders are to apprehend General Noriega. I would not go
beyond that.
   Q. Is President Endara in this country or in Panama?
   A. He's in Panama.
   Q. While the Panamanian Defense Forces perhaps may not measure
up to U.S. forces, nevertheless they're 6,500-strong. They're not
necessarily a pushover by any means. Yet you said tonight that
there was pretty much assurance on the part of the administration
that this mission would be successful. That indicates that there
may have been some communications with PDF Forces to either
participate or perhaps not resist. Was there any kind of
communication with PDF forces beforehand?
   A. I did not use the word ``assurance.'' I said that we would
not undertake such a mission if we did not feel confident that we
could carry it out successfully. I'm not aware of any
communications directly with the PDF.
   Q. You said the U.S. forces will be withdrawn as quickly as
possible. They will not be withdrawn until we have captured Noriega?
   A. We are not willing to specify how long or in what
circumstances they would be _ remain there.
   Q. Who's got operational control?
   A. Operational control is in the Pentagon.
   Let me just do one last thing on briefings, that I would expect
the next detailed briefing to be operationally oriented and related
to logistics and that will come from the Pentagon. We do not have a
time yet. I would not anticipate it soon, probably later in the
morning. I don't think there's any need for you all to stay here
the rest of the night, but you might want to hang around for a
while anyway. One final question.
   Q. You're sending massively troops in to get one man?
   A. There are four objectives to this. Getting General Noriega
out is certainly one of the main ones. It certainly is an
objective, yes. Thank you very much.

   Soldiers from the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force in Fort Ord,
Calif., were mobilized Tuesday night for transport to an
unannounced location, while Fort Bragg, N.C., units were on placed
on alert, Army officials said.
   Soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division (Light), which in some
deployments includes artillery and aviation units, were ordered to
report to the Fort Ord Army base for an ``emergency deployment
readiness training exercise,'' Army spokesman Jim Davis said.
   He said he could not comment on the number of soldiers, their
destination or time of departure.
   Spokesmen for the 82nd Airborne Division and 18th Airborne Corps
early Wednesday stood by a statement issued Monday that the
exercise at Fort Bragg was strictly routine.
   ``Periodically the Army exercises the readiness of selected
units,'' said Sgt. 1st Class Dana Jackson, an 82nd Division
spokesman. ``At this time, certain units at Fort Bragg are
undergoing a validation of their readiness and state of training.''
   Nineteen buses and a truck loaded with troops arrived at Travis
Air Force Base in Fairfield, Calif., late Tuesday, according to
KCRA-TV in Sacramento. But a base spokesman said he could not say
where the soldiers came from or where they were going.
   ``We cannot comment on any military operations at this time,''
said Sgt. Jerry Taranto. ``We can't comment on anything on the
operation.''
   Travis, 90 miles north of Fort Ord, was enveloped in heavy fog,
and no planes had taken off by late Tuesday, according to KCRA-TV.
   Last year, several thousand soldiers from the 7th Infantry
Division were dispatched to Panama for a prolonged training
exercise. The move was interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate
U.S. military might during the burgeoning dispute with Panama's
leader, Gen. Manuel Noriega.
   During last year's mobilization, troops from Fort Ord were bused
to Travis, where they were airlifted to Howard Air Force Base in
Panama.
   The United States has tried to extradict Noriega, who controls
the Panamanian military and the country, since he was indicted on
federal drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed along the Panama
Canal.
   U.S. troops in Panama have been on maximum alert and restricted
to base since Panamanian soldiers killed a U.S. Marine lieutenant
Saturday.

   Q. Is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the
Panamanians is scheduled to occur on Jan. 1 have anything to do
with the timing of this operation now?
   A. I don't think is has to do with the timing, but it certainly
has to do with the substance. We do have a responsibilty under the
Panama Canal Treaty for its safety and security, and we do believe
there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty.
And that is one of the aspects of our purpose here.
   Q. Can you give us any details of A, how it's going, B, what the
size of the U.S. force that was amassed for this was and how long
you think this operation might take?
   A. I really can't answer any of those questions in any great
detail. The United States is committing forces we believe are
adequate to the task. It is a major undertaking. There are numbers
of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task. But
I just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of
logistical characterization of the size.
   The president has been considering this matter for several days.
As you all know, he was quite disturbed by the events of last
weekend involving the killing of the United States Marine and the
harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife. The
president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers
on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a plan and
the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action.
Since then there have been any number of meetings. I will not go
into details of when and how they were conducted. But the president
has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since Sunday.
And there really has not been any question about our willingness or
our readiness to proceed since that time.
   Q. What are the troops' orders with regard to Noriega? Were they
ordered to try to take him alive? And if they do, what do you want
them to do with him?
   A. Their orders are to apprhenend Gen. Noriega and our purpose
is to return him to the United States for prosecution under our
laws regarding drug trafficking. Gen. Noriega was indicted in the
southern district of Florida in Miami and the northern district in
Tampa for drug trafficking. And we want to bring him to the United
States for prosecution under that indictment.
   Q. Who swore in Endara, under what legal authority and where is
he now?
   A. I don't know who swore him in. The legal authority of course
was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the May
elections and they are assuming office on that basis.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index regained its
early losses today while the dollar edged up against the yen on
news that U.S. troops had been sent to seize Panamaniam strongman
Manuel Noriega.
   The dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from Tuesday's
close of 143.80 yen. It started the day's trading at 143.92 yen and
ranged between 143.90-144.25 yen.
   Earlier trading was quiet as market players made small position
adjustments ahead of the Christmas holidays. But the dollar edged
up later in the afternoon on news that U.S. forces were attacking
Noriega's military headquarters in Panama City, said a trader with
the Bank of Tokyo, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   President Bush ordered troops into action following several days
of tension triggered by the shooting death in Panama on Saturday of
a U.S. military officer.
   ``Japanese market players were waiting to see how the New York
market reacts to the Panama situation tonight,'' the trader said.
   Participants were also held back by uncertainties over Japan's
discount rate increase, the trader added.
   ``Although the government yesterday denied a hike any time soon,
the market expects a 50 percent chance of a hike by the end of the
year,'' the trader said.
   Local news reports speculated the Bank of Japan might raise its
key lending rate to commercial banks by 0.5 percent to 4.25
percent, but the Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan denied the
increase would happen any time soon.
   Kyodo News Service reported today that Japan's central bank will
begin negotiations with the government in an attempt to raise the
discount rate soon, citing sources from within the Bank of Japan.
   An estimated $6.3 billion traded hands in spot trading, down
from $10.8 billion the previous Tuesday.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
regained 72.90 points, or 0.19 percent, ending at 38,512.00. It
lost 147.08 points Tuesday on the discount rate rumors.
   The index, which lost 128.57 points by the end of morning
trading, rose back toward the end of the afternoon as speculative
investors bought spot issues to collect profits from the spread
between the spot and futures markets, said Yoshio Shimoyama, a
senior dealer at Nikko Securities.
   ``The market adjusted the index's speed of increase, inspired by
the rumor of the discount rate hike yesterday, and the market
needed a rest,'' he said.
   ``Although the market was basically stable and was gradually
getting ready for the discount rate to happen, market players were
still a bit cautious,'' Shimoyama said.
   Trading was active with first-section volume estimated at 1
billion shares, up from 900 million Tuesday.

   Nancy Gephart dons a blue hospital gown once a
week and does for strangers' children what she used to do for her
son. She feeds them, talks to them, sings to them and holds them.
   She is one of a growing number of hospital ``cuddlers,'' who try
to provide emotional support and a healing touch to sick children
whose parents either cannot or will not do so.
   Nearly three decades ago, Gephart spent as much time as she
could at her son's bedside at Mount Washington Pediatric Hospital
as he lay suffering from rheumatic fever.
   ``In those days, visiting hours were very restricted, but now
parents are allowed to visit day or night _ but some of them
don't,'' Gephart said. ``Some of the parents just can't face the
severity of a child's (medical) problems.''
   Susan Kolodner, the hospital's director of volunteers,
characterized the children as ``medically fragile,'' adding:
   ``This is their home for several months or even years, and their
parents can't be here all the time. That's where the cuddlers come
in _ to provide an extra pair of hands for the nurses and to
provide the children with extra attention and love.''
   When Mount Washington began its cuddler program in 1986,
hospital officials were looking for ``the grandmother type,''
Kolodner said.
   The first cuddlers came from a retirement home up the street.
   ``At first, I said, `I can't do that. I don't have time,''' said
Edith Dobbs, a retired nurse who lives at that home. ``But I was so
impressed with their orientation program and with the nurses. ...
When I left, I was signed up for Tuesday mornings and I've been
here every Tuesday morning for the last three years.''
   The program has since expanded to include volunteers of all
ages. The 60 current cuddlers range from early 20s to 84, Kolodner
said.
   Once Mount Washington's cuddler program was established, other
area hospitals were swamped with calls asking about similar
volunteer programs, said Debbie Bangledorf, volunteer programs
coordinator for Johns Hopkins Hospital and Hopkins Children's
Center.
   ``We kept getting requests from people saying, `Do you have a
cuddler program?' so we sat down and said, `Hey, let's do it,'''
Bangledorf said. ``It's been an overwhelming success.''
   Other hospitals have started similar programs, in part to deal
with the growing number of children born to drug-dependent mothers.
Addicted at birth, the children require extra attention and
nurturing to calm them.
   ``Sometimes it will take two hours just to get a baby to drink a
few ounces of formula,'' said Gephart. ``The nurses each have to
take care of up to four patients. They just don't have the time to
sit for two hours with one baby.''
   Michele Jacobs, a nurse at Mount Washington, said the babies
quickly learn to associate their nurses with the sometimes painful
treatments they administer.
   ``But they get to know the cuddlers and you can see their faces
light up when a cuddler comes in,'' Jacobs said. ``They don't
associate the cuddlers with pain. They associate them with loving
and playing and cuddling. The cuddlers are a major, major help to
the babies.''
   ``They know when they see us that we're not anybody who's going
to act on them,'' said cuddler Rochelle Savetman. ``We never hold
them while they're getting shots or medicine. ... We're just
company for them.''
   Jacobs said parents also are grateful for the cuddlers' services.
   ``They feel better knowing that if they can't be here, there is
someone who will watch over their children and give them comfort,''
she said.
   ``People say this is one of the most giving things you can do,''
Gephart said. ``But it's definitely a two-way street. I get so much
out of it _ just to see a child who has been unresponsive smile, or
to get a child to eat something or to sleep. I get as much out of
it as they do.''

<HEAD>New York High Court Throws Out State Harassment Law</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note language in 5th graf</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BELLAFIORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's highest court ruled the state's
harassment law unconstitutional, saying speech that may be abusive
is still protected by the First Amendment.
   The decision may spark challenges against such laws in other
states, attorneys said.
   Civil rights advocates applauded the decision and said it would
prevent police officers from arresting people, especially
demonstrators, for using language that could be considered
offensive.
   ``I think it's clear now that you can't prosecute someone for
cursing someone out on the street,'' said Norman Siegel, executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
   The case involved a dispute in which a woman called a neighbor a
bitch and her son a dog as they passed by her door. The woman,
Jackie Dietze of Raymondville, also allegedly threatened to ``beat
the crap out of'' the woman.
   Dietze, 19, was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined $50.
   On Tuesday, the state Court of Appeals, in a 7-0 decision, threw
out her conviction. It ruled 5-2 that the law was unconstitutional.
   The court said the harassment statute ``prohibits a substantial
amount of constitutionally protected expression.''
   Judge Stewart Hancock Jr. said the law needed to be undone
``because its continued existence presents a significant risk of
prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech.''
   ``Casual conversation may well be abusive and intended to annoy.
So, too, may be light-hearted banter or the earnest expression of
personal opinion or emotion,'' Hancock said. ``But unless speech
presents a clear and present danger of some serious substantial
evil, it may neither be forbidden nor penalized.''
   Most states have anti-harassment statutes similar in intent to
New York's. William E. Hellerstein, a professor at the Brooklyn Law
School and a specialist on the First Amendment, said the decision
was bound to spur challenges in other states.
   The U.S. Supreme Court has not addressed the issue of whether
words _ unless representing a direct threat to safety _ can
constitute harassment, Hellerstein said.
   ``This should be a victory for all of us in protecting
liberty,'' said Douglas Lasdon, executive director of the Legal
Action Center for the Homeless, of Tuesday's decision. ``We don't
want to become a society where people get intimidated for being
creative or eccentric.''
   ``I guess the standard now is `fighting words,''' said Nancy
Connell, spokeswoman for state Attorney General Robert Abrams, who
was on the losing end of the case. ``You cannot say something that
is going to incite someone to an immediate act of violence.''
   Dietze's words drew tears from her neighbor, Shelly Lazore.
   Dietze denied using the language cited in the court case and
said that the incident with Lazore stemmed from a feud over a
boyfriend. Dietze said she was ``relieved'' that the case was over.
   Dietze's lawyer, Robert Ballan, said that while the decision may
expand freedom of speech, it could also have another impact.
   ``There are people who are quite obnoxious and are in the habit
of using foul language,'' Ballan said. ``These people are going to
feel like they can be as obnoxious as they wish.
   ``But those are the effects of freedom,'' he said.
   St. Lawrence County District Attorney Charles Gardner did not
return telephone calls. Prosecutors had maintained that Dietze
stepped over the line of acceptable behavior and that the
Constitution doesn't apply to abusive language.

<HEAD>Blacklisted Screenwriter Ben Barzman Dead at 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scriptwriter Ben Barzman, who was
blacklisted during the McCarthy era and whose movie credits include
``El Cid,'' ``Back to Bataan,'' ``The Blue Max,'' and ``Z,'' has
died. He was 79.
   Barzman died Friday after suffering a stroke.
   Barzman, a journalist, novelist and author of musical revues,
began writing for the movies in 1943.
   He wrote or co-wrote the scripts of such films as ``The Boy With
the Green Hair,'' ``Back to Bataan,'' ``El Cid,'' ``The Blue Max,''
``Z,'' ``The Visit,'' ``The Fall of the Roman Empire'' and ``Heroes
of Telemark.''
   Some of the movies did not contain his screen credit because of
the blacklist aimed at writers accused of being communist, said his
wife, Norma Barzman.
   Barzman left the United States in 1949 for London, where his
movie ``Christ in Concrete'' was being filmed.
   The movie, recently purchase by Home Box Office for release next
year, went on to win awards at several European film festivals, but
Barzman and his wife were told they were no longer welcome in
McCarthy-era Hollywood.
   The government went on to revoke the Canadian-born Barzman's
U.S. citizenship in 1954. Although the government restored his
citizenship nine years later, he and his wife and seven children
continued to life abroad until 1976.
   During that time he wrote novels and French and Italian films.
His 1960 book ``Echo X'' won a Science Fiction Book-of-the-Month
Award.
   He was honored with a Paris Cinematheque film retrospective in
1982 and the French named him an officer of the Order of the Arts
and Letters in 1985.
   A memorial service was scheduled for Jan. 7.
   Survivors include his wife, children and five grandchildren.

   As first word circulated concerning the
American military against Panama's Manuel Noriega, Senate
Republican leader Robert Dole said early Wednesday he expects
bipartisan support for President Bush's commitment of troops in
Panama City.
   ``We need to see how it plays out,'' said Dole in a telephone
interview with The Associated Press. ``I would guess there would be
widespread bipartisan support for the president.''
   Said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., ranking Republican on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, ``The majority of the Senate will feel
good by this turn of events. Certainly I feel a lot better.''
   ``I called to tell the president, `my complements to the
chef,''' he said in a telephone interview from his home in Raleigh,
N.C. He said he had been briefed on the operation just prior to the
White House news conference announcing the military mission.
   Immediate congressional reaction was limited because Congress is
in recess and the White House announced its action at 1 a.m.
   Dole said Bush called him shortly before the early morning White
House news conference announcing the military mission.
   He said the White House also was trying to reach Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who was in Mexico meeting with
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, but Dole did not know if
they'd gotten to him before the public announcment.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, also was briefed
about the operation.
   ``We don't believe it would be appropriate to comment at this
point,'' he said through his aide Jason Isaacson.
   Issacson said Dodd spoke to Secretary of State James Baker and
``is monitoring these events very closely. He is also making calls
to other people in the region.''
   Dodd has been generally supportive of President Bush actions
concerning Noriega.
   Dole said he met with the elected Panamanian officials Dec. 10
and ``they were in effect pleading with us to do something'' about
Noriega.
   Helms said he has confidence in the leaders of Panama sworn in
Tuesday night under American auspices, and said he has no plans to
bring up measures in the Senate calling for the abdication of the
Canal Treaties negotiated by former President Jimmy Carter, even
though he contines to oppose the treaties.
   ``I believe them to be sensible, rational people and some of my
concern about the United States surrendering the canal has been
diminished,'' said Helms.

   Several incidents between U.S. and
Panamanian troops have occurred this year before the U.S. invasion.
   Here is a list of major ones:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>___</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Jan. 6 _ Nine launches and two helicopters from the U.S.
Southern Command went to the southern outlet of the Panama Canal.
The Southern Command said it was a training mission; the Panamanian
Defense Forces called it intimidation.
   March 1 _ One Panamanian was killed and two were wounded when
they stepped on unexploded munitions in a military zone, the
Southern Command said.
   March 3 _ Panamanian soldiers held nine Southern Command school
buses carrying 100 children for three hours on grounds the buses
did not have proper license plates.
   Aug. 8 _ U.S. forces detained 20 Panamanians, including nine
soldiers who had tried to block maneuvers on U.S.-controlled
territory, the Southern Command reported. They were were released a
few hours later.
   Aug. 9 _ Southern Command tanks blocked the entrance to Fort
Amador and helicopters flew over the area at the southern end of
the canal. The Southern Command said it acted because Panama
detained two U.S. soldiers. The Americans were exchanged for two
Panamanians detained by the Americans that day.
   Aug. 17 _ The Southern Command conducted maneuvers at 11
installations along the Panama Canal. U.S. officials said they were
enforcing their rights under the Panama Canal treaties; Panama said
the United States was violating the treaties.
   Oct. 3 _ Panamanian soldiers attempted a coup against Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. American soldiers blocked some routes to
Defense Forces headquarters, but not all, and Noriega loyalists
rescued him.
   Oct. 31 _ U.S. forces blocked highways and held maneuvers along
the canal with tanks and aircraft. Panama called it an attempt at
intimidation.
   Nov. 20-21 _ The Southern Command blocked access to Health
Ministry installations with tanks, accusing Panamanian forces of
doing the same to Gorgas Hospital, a U.S. installation. All forces
withdraw two days later.
   Dec. 16 _ Panamanian soldiers fatally wounded an American
officer. The United States said the officer and his companions were
unarmed; the Panamanians said the Americans provoked the
confrontation.
   Dec. 18 _ An Army officer shot and wounded a Panamanian police
corporal.
   Dec. 20 _ President Bush ordered U.S. troops into combat in
Panama City on a mission to seize Noriega to face federal drug
charges in the United States.

   U.S. troops fought Panamanian forces
early Wednesday in a bid to oust Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
surrounding his headquarters in a blaze of cannon and machine-gun
fire. Opposition leader Guillermo Endara proclaimed himself
president.
   ``We have many dead and wounded caused by the attack on the city
of Panama,'' national radio said.
   An doctor at the city's Santo Tomas Hospital said there were
about 50 dead at the hospital and hundreds wounded. It was unclear
how many of the victims were civilians and how many were soldiers.
   Noriega's whereabouts were not known. However, Maj. Edgardo
Lopez, head of the Panamanian Defense Forces' press office, said on
Mexican television that Noriega had been warned and was safe in
another part of the country.
   ``They (U.S. forces) have destroyed the headquarters because
they thought Noriega was there,'' Lopez said. ``General Noriega is
in another part of the country and is on top of the situation.''
   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater announced
U.S. troops were on a mission ``to apprehend Manuel Noriega.''
   ``We are there to apprehend him and bring him back to America to
prosecute him,'' he said.
   Late Tuesday, mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire echoed across
the capital as truckloads of American troops headed from U.S.
military bases toward the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.
   ``We're kicking ass tonight,'' said one U.S. soldier who stopped
reporters along a road about two miles north of the headquarters.
   The Britich Broadcasting Corp. reported Wednesday morning that
the headquarters was in flames.
   By 3:45 a.m., the fighting in Panama City generally had quieted
down although there was sporadic gunfire, including the booming of
artillery and anti-aircraft fire.
   The main fighting appeared to take place around the defense
headquarters at the western tip of Panama City, in the poor and
densely populated neighborhood of El Chorillo.
   Fighting also was reported near Paitilla, a small airstrip along
the coast three miles to the east of the headquarters; near the
Marriott Hotel, about six miles east of the headquarters; at Fort
Cimarron, just over 20 miles east of the city; in Colon, 50 miles
to the north; and near an airport in Chiriqui, about 200 miles to
the west.
   On Tuesday night, planes and helicopters roared over Panama
City. At the Marriot hotel on the capital's eastern edge, armed
Panamanians took 12 foreigners hostage.
   Among them were three reporters, including from The Associated
Press, the New York Times and the Reuters news agency. They were
released unhurt about two hours later.
   ``A lot of Panamanians have died and we could kill you. Don't
think they won't,'' one of the Panamanians told the New York Times
reporter.
   CBS said there was a report of a fire at the U.S. Embassy.
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic and
political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges in February 1988. U.S. sanctions depressed the
economy, but did not budge Noriega, and two coup attempts _ most
recently in October _ failed to unseat him.
   Noriega has denied the drug charges and claims the United States
wanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cede
control of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.
   U.S. troops in Panama had been on maximum alert and restricted
to base since a U.S. Marine lieutenant was killed by Panamanians on
Saturday in what American officials called an unprovoked incident.
   On Tuesday, U.S. military transports flooded into American bases
in the country.
   Early Wednesday, government-controlled radio said, ``The general
headquarters is being bombarded with heavy artillery ... We are
being invaded by U.S. troops in a synchronized plan.''
   A man on the 16th floor of a building with a view of the
military headquarters in the poor residential neighborhood of El
Chorillo said: ``El Chorillo is in flames,'' he said. ``You can see
a mountain of flares.''
   Two ambulances were seen heading for Fort Clayton, a U.S. base,
from the combat zone near Defense Forces headquarters about an hour
after the fighting began under a full moon.
   In a radio broadcast shortly after the fighting broke out at
about midnight Tuesday, Endara called on Panamanian forces to
surrender peacefully and accept his electoral victory in May 7
balloting.
   Those elections were annulled by Noriega.
   ``Men of honor of the Defense Forces will have an important role
in a democratic Panama that will belong to all Panamanians,'' said
Endara.
   Radio Nacional, the national radio station, was still under
control of Noriega loyalists and broadcast an appeal for all
doctors to go to Santo Tomas hospital, a hospital on Panama Bay
about two miles east of the Panamanian Defense Headquarters and
near the U.S. Embassy.
   It said the headquarters had been ``cruelly bombarded.''
   Fighting also was reported east of the Marriott, about seven
miles east of the headquarters, where a Panamanian cavalry unit is
based.
   An Associated Press reporter saw 24 armored personnel carriers
and at least seven trucks carrying American troops head in the
direction of Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters.
   U.S. soldiers surrounding the main Panamanian military
installations yelled over megaphones for the Panamanian troops to
surrender, residents living near the installations said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass, reporting from Panama City, said:
``Panamanian radio is reporting that military planes and
helicopters of the U.S. Air Force are bombing the central part of
Panama ... At different points of the Panamanian capital armed
clashes have begun between American and Panamanian units.''
   ``There is all kinds of hell loose out there,'' three young
Panamanian soldiers told an AP reporter.
   Channel 8, television station of the U.S. Southern Command,
issued an Echo level alert, its highest, and said movement by
unauthorized U.S. personnel was prohibited.
   The United States has 12,000 troops based near the Panama Canal.
   The Panamanian Defense Forces, controlled by Noriega, come to
about 15,000 men. Noriega also has armed citizen ``Dignity
Battalions'' of his loyalists.
   Further aggravating tensions after Saturday night's shooting of
the American, another U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian
policeman because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon,
according to Southern Command.
   On Tuesday evening, a New York Times reporter and a Reuters
reporter were detained for about an hour by U.S. military police
when they tried to enter Howard air base to determine whether U.S.
forces were landing.
   The Times reporter's notebooks were confiscated by the U.S.
Army, the Times said in New York, and the two reporters were
released without incident.
   The Panama attack was the first U.S. military invasion of
another nation since Oct. 25, 1983, when a U.S.-led force invaded
Grenada, southernmost of the Caribbean Sea's Windward Isles, six
days after Marxist Prime Minister Maurice Bishop was executed
following a coup by radical army officers.
   More than than 6,000 U.S. soldiers participated in the assault,
which cost the lives of 19 Americans, 42 Cubans building an airport
on the island and 24 Grenadian civilians. All U.S. troops have left
the island.

   The Soviet Union on Wednesday swiftly condemned
the U.S. armed intervention in Panama and demanded it end
immediately.
   ``The United States has launched an act of aggression against
Panama,'' state-run Radio Moscow reported. It said the Central
American country was the victim of an American military
``invasion.''
   ``These actions, a violation of the U.N. Charter and generally
recognized rules of state relations, should be condemned by the
international community,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P.
Perfiliev said. ``The United States must immediately stop its armed
intervention in Panama.''
   Perfiliev was quoted by the official Tass news agency as saying
that the U.S. action, ``whatever its motivation, has provoked a
feeling of serious concern in the Soviet Union.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
ordered U.S. troops to seize the Panamanian leader, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega, and bring him to the United States for trial on
federal drug charges.
   Tass said Perfiliev commented in response to questions from
reporters.

<HEAD>Decision to Strike Against Noriega Made on Sunday, White House Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush made up his mind Sunday to
launch the U.S. military strike against Panama's Manuel Antonio
Noriega, barely 24 hours after the slaying of an American Marine
officer outside Noriega's military headquarters in Panama City, the
White House said.
   Bush administration officials kept their plans secret until
Tuesday evening when news organizations began reporting heavy U.S.
military flights into Panama, where the United States has 12,000
troops based to protect the Panama Canal.
   Even as the Pentagon was preparing the effort to capture Noriega
and allow Panamanian opposition leaders to take over the
government, Bush went as planned Tuesday evening to a White House
Christmas party for 300 friends, administration officials, White
House staff and reporters.
   The president maintained silence Sunday when asked for his
reaction to the killing of the unarmed Marine lieutenant, who was
trying to escape a Panamanian Defense Force checkpoint after a
wrong turn brought him and three other U.S. soldiers close to
Noriega's headquarters.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, in an early morning
briefing today announcing the move against Noriega, said Bush ``has
been considering this matter for several days.'' He said the
president ``was quite disturbed'' by the killing of the Marine
officer and harassment of a naval officer and his wife by
Panamanian soldiers at the same checkpoint.
   ``The president reviewed this issue with his national security
advisers on Sunday afternoon. They considered options, developed a
plan and the president made the basic decision to proceed with this
action,'' Fitzwater said.
   He added that there had been ``any number of meetings'' since
Sunday, but emphasized, ``there really has not been any question
about our willingness or our readiness to proceed since that time.''
   The White House on Sunday deplored the killing of the Marine and
said the incident was a ``consequence'' of the outlaw Noriega
regime, imposed on Panama against ``the will of the Panamanian
people'' who voted in May to elect opposition leader Guillermo
Endara to the presidency.
   Noriega, Panama's military commander and de facto ruler,
nullified those elections. On Friday a legislature of Noriega
cronies declared the country in a state of war against the United
States and named Noriega its ``maximum'' leader.
   Bush, in an interview Monday with The Associated Press and other
wire services, expressed ``enormous frustration ... that the
democratic system that was voted on in Panama was totally put down
by force.''
   He called the killing of the Marine ``an enormous outrage,'' and
pointedly refused to rule out a military response.
   Bush had no public events on his schedule Tuesday except the
Christmas party, where he and wife Barbara gaily posed with each
guest for pictures in front of an enormous tree, decorated with
dolls from children's stories and fables.
   Bush stayed to hear an Army chorus sing carols in the East Room,
hoisting up 3-year-old granddaughter Nancy Ellis LeBlond in his
arms for a better view and extending a hearty handshake to former
White House press secretary Jim Brady, wounded in the 1981
assassination attempt against former President Reagan.
   At the Pentagon, military public information officers also
sought not to tip their hand. Most left their offices at the
regular quitting time Tuesday evening.
   National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft, his deputy Robert
Gates and White House Chief of Staff John Sununu all put in brief
appearances at the Christmas party Tuesday night before shuttling
back to their offices to wait for the U.S. military strike.
   Bush stayed in the Oval Office until 4:05 a.m. EST, when he
retired to his personal residence for a brief sleep before a 7 a.m.
address to the nation from the Oval Office.

   Soldiers from the Rapid Deployment Force
at Fort Ord and from Fort Bragg, N.C., have been dispatched to
Panama to help apprehend Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Sen. Pete
Wilson said today.
   ``Elements of the 7th Light Infantry Division ... have
supplemented the 12,000 troops already in Panama,'' the California
Republican said in a telephone interview with Los Angeles radio
station KNX.
   Troops from Fort Bragg were airlifted to Panama, said Wilson,
who praised President George Bush for the decision to send to the
Central American country.
   Noriega is ``up to his eyeballs in the drug traffic,'' Wilson
said.
   Noriega, who nullified his country's May elections, was indicted
on U.S. drug trafficking charges in February 1988.
   The senator's comments followed the mobilization Tuesday night
of an undetermined number of soliders from Fort Ord, about 80 miles
south of San Francisco, and their transfer, apparently to Travis
Air Force Base in Fairfield.
   Soldiers of the 7th Infantry Division (Light), which in some
deployments includes artillery and aviation units, were ordered to
report to Fort Ord for an ``emergency deployment readiness training
exercise,'' some time Monday, said Jim Davis, public affairs
officers for the Army.
   Davis, however, said that as a matter of policy, he could not
comment on the number mobilized, their destination or their time of
departure.
   By early today, military convoys were seen heading north on
Interstate 680 toward Fairfield, according to the California
Highway Patrol.
   Nineteen buses and a truck loaded with soldiers arrived at
Travis late Tuesday, according KCRA-TV in Sacramento. More buses
and trucks were reported going into the base about 40 miles
northeast of San Francisco. But a base spokesman said he could not
say where the soliders came from or where they were going.
   ``We cannot comment on any military operations at this time,''
said Sgt. Jerry Taranto. ``We can't comment on anything on the
operation.''
   Travis was enveloped in heavy fog, making flights difficult.
   Earlier Tuesday, C-141 planes were seen in the air around Fort
Bragg, home of the Army's 82nd Airborne division.
   Fort Bragg spokesmen would say only that Army units there were
participating in a routine ``emergency deployment readiness
exercise.'' Sgt. Bobby Feibel, a spokesman for the division, said
he had no information on reports that some of the division had left
Fort Bragg.

   Redoubt Volcano's eruption subsided,
allowing scientists to get their closest look yet, and holiday
travelers got off the ground as fears eased that volcanic ash would
clog jet engines.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory said no more ash reached
Anchorage after a plume consisting mostly of gas gushed from the
volcano early Tuesday.
   ``The plume appears to be moving primarily toward the southwest
and west,'' observatory geologist Steve Brantley said.
   He said the volcano, about 115 miles from Anchorage, sent forth
little ash.
   Redoubt erupted Thursday after 23 years. The fallout brought
Anchorage air traffic to a virtual halt Saturday as the hectic
Christmas travel season opened.
   Geologists made a research flight over Redoubt on Tuesday, but
clouds obscured the top of the 10,197-foot volcano, and
observations were limited, Brantley said. He said earthquake
activity beneath the volcano appeared to slacken early in the
afternoon.
   ``It's too early to tell whether this indicates a significant
change in the volcano's behavior, or whether it's just a short-term
fluctuation,'' Brantley said.
   The main carrier serving the Anchorage-Seattle route resumed
regular operations Tuesday and added flights to deal with a backlog
of about 1,200 passengers in Anchorage.
   ``We're moving them,'' Alaska Airlines spokesman Lou Cancelmi
said. ``We are also moving post office mail, and we've got
additional freighters scheduled. It's going pretty well.''
   At Anchorage International Aiport, the operations office said
crowds awaiting flights thinned as airlines began flying, although
some interstate carriers with relatively light Alaska schedules did
not resume service.
   Carriers serving Alaska points from Anchorage were back in the
sky, but some international lines continued to divert flights to
airports elsewhere, airport officials said.
   About 70 of 240 passengers with tickets for Korean Airlines
Flight 25 remained in Anchorage on Tuesday for what they said were
safety reasons, said Lee Steiner, KAL's customer relations manager
in Los Angeles. The others left aboard a Korea-bound flight early
in the day.
   Last week, a Boeing 747 operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
fell about two miles after it passed through volcanic ash and lost
power to all four engines. The engines were restarted and the plane
made an emergency landing at the Anchorage airport.
   Steiner said the KAL passengers who stayed behind would be put
aboard the next available plane to Korea, ``but we don't know when
that will be at this point. It depends on the climatic conditions.''
   Aside from passengers, the U.S. Postal Service continued to
charter aircraft to haul the usual upsurge in holiday mail between
Anchorage and Seattle.
   By Tuesday morning, 60,000 pounds of mail waited to be flown
from Anchorage, some of it left from Monday and the rest deposited
overnight at the airport's 24-hour post office, the Postal Service
said.
   About 90,000 pounds awaited transportation north from Seattle.
Officials expected the backlogs to be cleared up by today.

   Polar air dropped temperatures as low as 40 below zero and
powered piercing gusts across the northern Plains today, spawning
deadly wind chills of 80 below on the day before the official start
of winter.
   Snow was falling on either side of the arctic front gripping the
nation's midsection. Northwestern Montana expected 4 to 8 inches of
new snow today in the valleys and a foot or more in the mountains.
   Another round of lake effect snow in New York state was expected
east of Lake Ontario and Lake Erie today. Lake squalls have dumped
more than 2 feet of snow from Oswego to Pulaski, N.Y., over the
past few days.
   Life-threatening wind chills were predicted for Minnesota, the
Dakotas, Illinois and Iowa today and Thursday as gusts of up to 30
mph combined with increasingly frigid air.
   ``This is way below normal for December,'' said Richard May, a
National Weather Service meteorologist at Bismarck, N.D., which
recorded Tuesday's coldest reading for the Lower 48 states at 35
below. ``It will be the worst cold we've had this season.''
Tuesday's temperatures ranged between 30 and 40 degrees below
normal statewide.
   Snow advisories were in effect today over north-central Indiana
and northwestern Upper Michigan and for western Lower Michigan
along Lake Michigan.
   A winter storm watch was posted over Upper Michigan for late
today and Thursday.
   Michigan was on track for its coldest December on record. The
state's average mean temperature for the first 18 days in the month
was 14.1 degrees, according to the National Weather Service. The
normal for the month is 23.5 degrees.
   Rain reached across the Carolina coasts through Georgia to
northern Florida Tuesday. A winter weather advisory for snow,
freezing rain and sleet was posted for South Carolina, except the
southern coast.
   A heavy snow warning for northwest Indiana was canceled, but a
snow advisory remained in effect from near La Porte to the Elkhart
area. By today, as much as 10 inches of snow had fallen near South
Bend and La Porte, which has received up to 3 feet of new snow over
the past few days.
   Three Florida cities reached record high temperatures Tuesday
for the date. Hollywood's 84 degrees and Miami's 85 bested marks
set in 1986.
   West Palm Beach hit 88 degrees to break a 28-year-old record and
set Tuesday's high temperature in the nation.

   ``I want them home in time for Christmas,'' Judge Robert J.
Morgan said in setting today as a deadline for the children to be
released to their parents.
   ``It will be good to get my children back,'' Broussard told
reporters at the conclusion of the four-day custody hearing.
   A Clackamas County Circuit Court judge agreed last month to
allow custodial visits to resume between Broussard, his wife and
their surviving children.
   The Broussard children, ages 5 to 11, have been in state care
since the sensational child abuse case erupted. Thirty-three
Ecclesia children remain in foster homes, according to the state
Children's Services Division.
   On Oct. 14, 1988, the body of Dayna Broussard was taken to a
rural fire station by members of the Ecclesia Athletic Association,
a religious and athletic training group founded by Broussard in the
Watts section of Los Angeles.
   The next day, state juvenile authorities were dispatched to
Ecclesia's farmhouse east of Portland, where they found 55 hungry,
abused children crammed into four bedrooms. The youngsters were
loaded onto buses and turned over to the Children's Services
Division.
   Broussard, who was in California at the time of the beating,
defended the four Ecclesia staff members charged with first-degree
manslaughter.
   He denied that he was a cult leader and that the Ecclesia
children had been mistreated. But during the trial, four of the
children testified how they had witnessed young Dayna's punishment
for taking food from another child's plate. They said they were
forced to watch and count the blows _ more than 800.
   In May, three men and a woman were convicted in the killing, and
they were sentenced to maximum 20-year prison terms in June. Later,
a fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment for beating
other children.
   By that time, the Ecclesia Athletic Association had disbanded
and Broussard, who once defended his group on Oprah Winfrey's
television show, had begun to fade from the public eye.
   On the anniversary of the beating death, 40 of the children
remained in foster homes. Children's Services Division officials
said their parents had refused to admit past abuses or to promise
they would be safe from abuse.
   The following week there was a turning point in the case, when
Broussard appeared at a custody hearing for his 3-year-old nephew.
For the first time, he acknowledged that Ecclesia members had been
culpable in his daughter's death.
   The response was immediate from Morgan, who ruled the boy could
be returned to his parents by year's end.
   The following month, Broussard and his wife returned to court to
request custody of their own children.
   Broussard broke into tears while defending his assertion that
adult Ecclesia members put group concerns ahead of the children's
needs.
   Morgan told Broussard he was moved by his show of emotion.
``Maybe it's says something that hasn't been said before,'' said
Morgan. ``Everyone is sorry it happened. It's now history. We must
look ahead.''
   On Nov. 16, the Broussards' custody request was granted.
   The parents were given a list of 11 conditions to meet, among
them that corporal punishment would be forbidden and that the
children must attend public schools and undergo regular mental
health counseling.
   State Children's Services Division spokesman Bart Wilson
confirmed Tuesday that the Broussards were give the final go-ahead
on Dec. 13, but he declined to reveal further details of the
family's plans.

<HEAD>Travelers Urged to be Careful During Travel Season</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More people than usual are expected to hit the
nation's transportation routes during the Christmas weekend, and
safety officials are urging motorists to be extra careful.
   Some 35.8 million people _ the highest number in five years _
planned to travel at least 100 miles away from home during the
holiday weekend, according to a national survey.
   The U.S. Travel Data Center surveyed 1,500 nationwide for the
AAA-Chicago Motor Club.
   About 5.2 million people planned to travel by car, the survey
found. The holiday officially begins at 6 p.m. Friday and ends at
11:59 p.m. on Dec. 25.
   With so many motorists on the highways, between 320 and 420
people could be killed in car accidents, the National Safety
Council said.
   Another 15,000 to 19,000 people could suffer disabling injuries,
the council said.
   During the Christmas holiday last year, 386 people died in car
accidents and about 17,900 were injured.
   Travelers should gas up their cars early because about
two-thirds of the nation's gas stations will be closed on
Christmas, AAA-Chicago said.

<HEAD>Attorneys Say Woman's Remarriage Changes Embryo Appeal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARYVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman who won control of seven
frozen human embryos in an unprecedented custody dispute has
remarried, and lawyers for her ex-husband say that could help them
when the case is appealed.
   Mary Sue Davis, who has been living in Florida since the August
divorce trial, married James Stowe in Cape Canaveral last week.
   Attorneys Janet Mayfield and Charles Clifford said the
remarriage could bolster their case of Junior Lewis Davis before
the state Court of Appeals.
   The lawyers said the remarriage renders moot two of Mrs. Davis'
contentions during the trial: that the seven embryos created by her
and Davis at a Knoxville fertility clinic last year might represent
her last chance to become pregnant and that fertilization clinics
would not take her as a client if she were single.
   ``My client always maintained this wasn't her last chance,'' Ms.
Mayfield said. ``If the court of appeals adopts the reasoning we'll
ask them to, to balance the interests of the two adults, then I
think the remarriage would affect the balance.''
   That was not, however, the reasoning adopted by the trial judge,
W. Dale Young of Blount County Circuit Court.
   Young ruled that the embryos are essentially unborn human beings
with rights of their own, and decided the case based on what he
felt was best for the embryos.
   ``Based on that ruling, this doesn't affect his reasoning at
all,'' Ms. Mayfield said.
   But, she said she believes Mrs. Davis' remarriage ``makes a
psychological difference to the court.''
   She said it will be the spring before the appeals court hears
the case.

<HEAD>Settlement Near in Onassis Dispute Over Martha's Vineyard Lot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacqueline Onassis' dispute with the Wampanoag
Indians over a prime beach-front property that the Indians say
contain the graves of a chief and his wife may soon be resolved,
lawyers for both sides say.
   Wampanoag lore holds that Chief Moshup and his wife, Squant, are
buried on the disputed Martha's Vineyard land. Moshup, according to
the oral tradition, threw his children into the sea when he saw the
white man approaching.
   Mrs. Onassis bought a 17 percent interest in the Gay Head beach
property in 1980 from a Wampanoag family that has owned the
property since the state surveyed and divided up Gay Head in 1870.
   A hearing expected to settle the matter of the 264-foot stretch
of coastal property was set for Feb. 2, Onassis attorney Brian
Hurley said Tuesday.
   ``There have been negotiations but we're not quite there yet,''
he said. The beach is held in undivided interest by more than 25
individuals, including Mrs. Onassis. But since she purchased her
part of the beach, the widow of President Kennedy has fought the
matter in court. Her private 380-acre retreat surrounds the beach.
   Paul Sulla, a Boston attorney and Gay Head resident representing
the Indians, said a settlement was close. He declined to discuss
the terms.
   The Wampanoag are descendants of the island's first settlers.
   Mrs. Onassis bought the acreage for her home in the mid-1970s
and since then has brought a series of legal actions in an attempt
to clear the title on the adjoining land.
   In turn, the Wampanoag sued Mrs. Onassis to retain access to the
property.

8th pvs, `Mrs. Thatcher's ...</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday
hailed as courageous the U.S. invasion of Panama and declared ``the
rule of democracy must be upheld.''
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke to reporters on the steps of her Downing
Street office after President Bush telephoned her at 7 a.m. (2 a.m.
EST) to tell her he had sent in U.S. troops to seize Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, wanted on U.S. drug charges.
   ``I said we would fully support him in the action he was taking
to bring an end to this rule of terror,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``I
believe he was right to do so. I believe this is what friends are
for to give support at this time. It was a courageous decision.'
   Mrs. Thatcher called on other world leaders to declare support
for Bush, saying ``Every action has a risk and it is important that
it be successful.''
   ``Gen. Noriega is wanted on drugs allegations in the United
States. We are fighting terror and the battle against drugs as
well. The rule of democracy should be upheld,'' she added.
   A government spokesman said Bush told Mrs. Thatcher she was the
first foreign head of the government he had called with the news.
They talked for 10 minutes.
   Mrs. Thatcher's warm response contrasted with her public
criticism of the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in 1983 to overthrow
a leftist administration that had seized power in the Caribbean
island. Grenada is a former British colony that regards Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II as its titular head of state.
   Britain's opposition Labor Party criticized the Panama invasion,
saying it had ``nothing to do with democracy in Panama and
everything to do with protecting the American interests in the
Canal Zone.''
   ``I think everyone agrees that Noriega is a nasty dictator but
that's not the reason for the intervention,'' Labor's foreign
affairs spokesman George Foulkes said in a British Broadcasting
Corp. radio interview.
   ``The main reason is that the Americans have got a key interest
in the Panama Canal Zone ... They have therefore decided to take
the law into their own hands.''

<HEAD>Dollar Higher in Nervous Trading, Gold Slightly Lower</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The dollar rose in nervous trading today after
U.S. forces launched an attack to topple Panama's leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega. Gold prices were slightly lower in dull
trading.
   Dealers said the dollar shot up when news of the U.S. military
move broke about 1:40 p.m. In times of international tensions, the
market looks for a safe haven and usually turns to the dollar.
   ``The situation can escalate, and such an escalation means a
firmer dollar,'' said Jens-Uwe Fischer, a trader at Manufacturers
Hanover Trust in Frankfurt.
   The thinness of the pre-Christmas market, from which most
traders already have withdrawn, was contributing to the dollar's
strong reaction to the news, dealers said.
   Another trader at a U.S. bank in Frankfurt said the dollar was
rising before the Panamanian crisis on the selling of West German
marks.
   A trader in Milan said the mark was depressed by the unrest in
Romania and higher French interest rates.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.43 yen to a closing 144.23 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.05 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.7415 West German marks, up from 1.7365
   _1.5630 Swiss francs, up from 1.5615
   _5.9438 French francs, up from 5.9300
   _1.9648 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9575
   _1,295.50 Italian lire, up from 1,291.25
   _1.1622 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1613
   In London, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost
$1.5980 to buy one pound, cheaper than $1.6005 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $412.50 a troy ounce,
down from $413.75 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $413.15.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $413, down from $414 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell 76 cents to close at a bid $412.04.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.58 a troy ounce, up
from Tuesday's $5.57.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts 11 in Atlantic City Corruption Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four top Atlantic City officials are among
11 people under indictment in a broad corruption probe in the
gambling resort, but the grand jury was silent on the mayor, who
had been arrested in the case.
   ``It's an active, ongoing investigation,'' the state attorney
general's spokesman, Christopher Florentz, said Tuesday. ``It does
not conclude with today's indictments. The charges at this time
have not been dropped.''
   Atlantic City Mayor James Usry had no comment, said Rosalind
Norrell-Nance, an aide.
   ``City government can continue to march,'' said business
administrator Carl Briscoe, who runs the resort's everyday affairs.
   Among those indicted Tuesday were City Council President Walter
Collette, Councilman Gene Dorn and Zoning Board Chairman Kaleem
Shabazz, who are all accused of accepting bribes to use their
positions to obtain zoning breaks and other benefits for private
businesses.
   Another councilman, Arnold Orsatti Jr., was charged with
participating in the conspiracy.
   A state police sting hit the top echelon of Atlantic City's
government with arrests and corruption charges on July 27. Besides
the 11 indicted, Usry and two others were arrested in the sweep
that culminated an eight-month investigation.
   Usry, 67, was led away from his home by police in a roundup of
suspects. Authorities said $6,000 in cash was found in his home,
but the mayor's attorney said the money was a contribution from a
businessman that Usry was to relay to a children's charity.
   The arrest was an embarrassment to state Republicans, including
Gov. Thomas H. Kean, who had helped put Usry in office and make him
one of the most prominent black Republican officials in the nation.
   Including Usry _ who was elected as a reformer _ four of
Atlantic City's last seven mayors have been arrested.
   The indictment also named W. Oscar Harris, former director of
the city's housing authority; Robert McCurdy, a former jockey and
partner in a liquor store; Harold Mosee, an aide to Collette and a
former councilman; and Jack Wolf, a consultant for Pan Am World
Services.
   State Police Superintendent Col. Clinton Pagano said Collette is
charged with accepting a $1,000 bribe in May by Albert Black, who
was cooperating as an undercover agent for the state police.
   Authorities said the investigation began when Black approached
them with reports that Harris had solicited a bribe from him.
   Black became a key source for investigators, but his account of
the complex of alleged bribes and influence was questioned by one
suspect Tuesday.
   ``Al Black has altered the facts and corrupted the truth beyond
recognition,'' Wolf said. ``The Salem witch hunts prove that in the
end, truth will win out.''
   Authorities suspect Collette accepted the bribe in exchange for
influencing a zoning variance that would enable Black to operate a
car wash.
   Dorn was accused in the indictment of taking a $7,500 cash bribe
from Black to obtain a zoning variance for a gas station.
   Dorn and Wolf were also charged with soliciting and accepting
$3,500 in bribes from Black for influencing Pam Am to give Black a
gift shop concession at Atlantic City International Airport.
   All 11 defendants will be arraigned in January in Superior Court
in Trenton.

   Howard Rollins, co-star of the NBC series
``In the Heat of the Night,'' has taken time off because of illness.
   Carroll O'Connor, the show's executive producer and star, said
Tuesday Rollins entered a hospital several weeks ago after having
chest pains.
   Although the tests showed he had no coronary problems, the actor
decided to take some time off, he said.
   ``We are all expecting him to return to work in the near future
as soon as he is able to physically withstand our very strenuous
work schedule,'' O'Connor said.
   He called Rollins a ``vital part of the series,'' adding, ``I
miss him professionally and personally and want him back on the
set.''
   David Gerber, chairman and chief executive officer of MGM@UA
Television Production Group Inc., said the show, which is filmed on
location in the Covington area, may rely on guest appearances by
other actors while Rollins recuperates.

<TEXT>
   Ice clogged more than 200 miles of the Mississippi River and
people across the country bundled up today against an arctic blast
that dropped temperatures to record lows from the Plains to the
East Coast.
   ``You'd have to take extra care if you're going to be out for
any length of time,'' said Paul Merzlock, a weather service
forecaster in Chicago. ``It's certainly a danger.''
   Since Friday, at least 40 deaths have been blamed on the
weather, including traffic deaths on slippery roads and hypothermia.
   In North Dakota, high temperatures today were expected to be no
more than 15 below to 25 below, with winds of 15 to 25 mph
producing wind chills of 55 below to 80 below, according to the
National Weather Service.
   ``This is way below normal for December,'' said Richard May, a
weather service meteorologist at Bismarck, which recorded Tuesday's
coldest reading for the Lower 48 at 35 below. ``It will be the
worst cold we've had this season.''
   A 203-mile stretch of the Mississippi River, from St. Louis to
Cairo, Ill., was closed to barge traffic by ice and low water, the
U.S. Coast Guard said.
   About 60 percent of the 195 miles of Missouri River north of
Omaha, Neb., to the Gavins Point Dam was frozen Tuesday, forming
ice jams that reduced the amount of water flowing downstream to
towns and power plants.
   The river level was within one foot of the level at which some
power plants would be unable to operate because their water intake
systems would no longer work, said Chet Worm, chief of the
reservoir regulation section of the Corps Missouri River District.
   About 300,000 Illinois-American Water Co. customers in
Belleville, East St. Louis and Granite City soon may have to ration
water if the cold weather keeps freezing the river and causing ice
to form on water intake valves, officials said.
   In such brutal weather conditions, officials advised people
going outside to dress with extra layers of clothing and to carry
emergency survival kits when traveling. Farmers and ranchers also
were warned to take precautions to protect their animals from the
bitter cold.
   In Grand Forks, N.D., the local humane society put to sleep 40
animals on Monday to make room for a high number of animals brought
in because of the bitter cold, said the society's executive
director, Terri Toay.
   Michigan outreach centers pleaded for donations of warm clothes
to help the needy stave off the unusual cold. The average mean
temperature in Michigan for the first 18 days of December was 14.1
degrees, compared to the month's norm of 23.5 degrees.
   ``There are people coming in here with just tennis shoes on
their feet. It's cold, so cold out,'' said Floria Ellison at St.
Patrick's Outreach in Detroit on Tuesday.
   Ice on roads was blamed for accidents around metropolitan
Atlanta and Athens, Ga., and police blocked off several interstate
highway ramps that were littered with cars and trucks unable to
cross slick spots.
   Record low temperatures for the date Tuesday included 8 at
Atlantic City, N.J.; 6 at Baltimore; 10 at Bridgeport, Conn.; 26
below zero at Dickinson, N.D.; 6 below at Elkins, W.Va.; 19 below
at Grand Island, Neb.; 5 at Harrisburg, Pa.; 20 below at Lincoln,
Neb.; 24 below at Norfolk, Neb.; 7 below at Wheat Ridge, Colo.; and
3 below at Youngstown, Ohio.
   But Florida baked. Miami hit a record high of 85 and West Palm
Beach reached a record 88.

   Passengers said it felt ``like a
nightmare'' when a collision between a truck hauling chocolate
syrup and the Amtrak train in which they were riding killed three
people and injured 55.
   John Bruno, a passenger from Seattle, said Tuesday's crash
``felt like somebody had dead-stopped us. Then we hit three times.
... My head was clobbered each time.''
   ``I was collecting tickets and then all hell broke loose,'' said
conductor Gary Burke. ``I wound up flying into the next car.''
   California Highway Patrol spokesman Bob Whitmire said Tuesday
that investigators were trying to determine the accident's cause,
including the dense fog which was blamed for a couple of multi-car
pileups in the region.
   The crash killed the truck driver and two train crewmen.
   Amtrak spokesman Arthur Lloyd said the truck driver seemed to be
responsible for the crash. ``Evidently the vehicle ignored the
lights and went right in front of train,'' Lloyd said.
   But Gov. George Deukmejian, who toured the scene, said the three
people killed in the crash may be the only ones who really know
what happened.
   The 70-mph speed of the train was within the limit for the area,
according to federal transportation officials.
   People aboard the train, which carried at least 142 including
five Amtrak crew members, described nightmarish conditions during
the crash and its aftermath. No one said they had seen the truck or
warning devices at the crossing before the collision.
   ``It was like a nightmare,'' said passenger Phyllis Ferguson of
Stockton. ``I was sitting there reading the paper and then crash,
fire. I was thrown to the floor. Seats crumpled ahead and behind
me. Everybody was screaming and yelling. One woman was yelling for
her baby.''
   Several passengers said the train and ground were so covered
with chocolate from the truck that they slipped as they tried to
leave the train.
   ``It hit hard, harder than anything I've ever felt,'' said
Angela Price, who was in third of five passenger cars behind the
engine. ``I was thrown forward.
   ``I was looking out the window and I could see the flames (of
the burning truck and train engine wreckage) coming toward us. .. .
I just braced myself and watched it, but it stopped, thank God.''
   The 34-year-old Berkeley woman said she was not going on to Los
Angeles. ``I don't want to get on another train,'' she said.
   The San Joaquin County coroner's office identified the dead
truck driver as David Haskell, 47, of Pomona. The other two victims
were identified only as the train's engineer and fireman, pending
notification of relatives.
   Of the 55 injured, 24 seriously injured people were taken by
ambulance to hospitals, Whitmire said. Buses took 31 others to
various medical facilities for examination and treatment of minor
injuries.
   Whitmire said 87 uninjured people were taken by bus to the
Riverbank Amtrak station, about 20 miles south of the crash site.
   The train was southbound from Oakland to Bakersfield on Amtrak's
San Joaquin route when the crash occurred at 9:38 a.m., about nine
minutes after leaving the Stockton station.
   The Amtrak locomotive overturned and burst into flames, which
took more than an hour to extinguish.
   The truck was demolished, broken into hundreds of small pieces,
and carried 300 feet down the tracks by the train's engine. The
truck's load of chocolate syrup coated two of the train's five
passenger cars.
   The investigation into the cause of the crash by transportation
officials continued Tuesday night as Amtrak crews pulled luggage
from the wreckage.
   Cleanup and repair of 900 feet of damaged track was expected to
take several days.

   Is Shylock, the infamous moneylender of William
Shakespeare's ``The Merchant of Venice,'' victim or villain?
   Dustin Hoffman opts for mild-mannered victim in Peter Hall's
straightforward, ungimmicky production of the play which opened
Tuesday at Broadway's 46th Street Theater. Hoffman was the reason
this problematic comedy was a hot ticket in London last summer and
why it was brought to Broadway for what looks like a sold-out
12-week run.
   The star's fans won't be disappointed, but his almost genial
approach robs the play of much of its emotional depth and Shylock
of his complexity. Dressed in a flowing robe, his long hair pulled
back tightly under a skullcap, the bearded Hoffman jokes and grins
in a manner that would not be out of place in the current Lincoln
Center revival of Paddy Chayefsky's ``The Tenth Man.''
   His voice, flavored with an appropriate Jewish accent, is strong
and projects well. Shylock's impassioned speech defending his
Jewishness is delivered quietly with a somber dignity that is
Hoffman's best moment in the play.
   His Shylock is an accommodating man, especially when he agrees
to lend money to Antonio in exchange for a pound of flesh if the
borrower defaults. Shylock meekly suffers humiliation. If revenge
is on his mind, he doesn't let anyone know, at least until he
thinks he can win.
   Hall clearly sees Shylock as a survivor of persecution in a
society where antisemitism was rampant. The Venetian Christians are
the real villains of the piece, louts who spit in the Jew's face,
steal his daughter and even force him to become a Christian before
the final curtain.
   If Shylock's plight is heavily underlined in Hall's production,
his tragedy is never fully explored or realized by the star. The
loss of his daughter to Lorenzo, a Christian, and even the
forfeiture of his own faith don't seem like the devastating blows
they should be. There's no sense of tragedy when the defeated
Shylock walks out of the courtroom to the jeers and harassment of
the crowd.
   At the same time, his villainy during the famous courtroom scene
seems unemotional, almost perfunctory. Hoffman earns laughs rather
than hisses when he sharpens his knife to collect the pound of
flesh, and cheers on the judge when he appears to be winning his
case.
   Hall has better success with the lighter, more romantic aspects
of the play. The scenes in which the three suitors must pick the
right casket if they are to win the fair Portia are staged as
pageants, complete with a stage full of extras, strange music,
exotic costumes.
   Geraldine James, in the play's real star role, is a radiant
Portia, witty as well as intelligent, and with a charming
competitiveness that would endear her to the most ardent feminist.
   Her interpretation of the ``quality of mercy'' speech _ one of
the best known in the Shakespeare _ is a revelation and the heart
of the play. She speaks these lines as if she's giving a bit of
sensible advice rather than commanding the stage for a star turn.
   Leigh Lawson is a sober-sided but not morose Antonio, the
merchant whose life is nearly lost for friendship. Most of the
younger performers in the large cast perfectly capture the gaiety
of what are some of Shakespeare's best romantic scenes. Nathaniel
Parker is properly impassioned as the lovestruck Bassanio, while
Michael Siberry is a terrific Gratiano, turning the usually
long-winded boor into a funny, well-meaning best friend.
   Chris Dyer's setting is impressively adaptable, a series of
reddish-brown pillars that can turn quickly from a Venetian street
scene to idyllic Belmont to the Duke's palace by the dropping of a
curtain or the unfurling of a long red carpet.
   ``The Merchant of Venice'' makes a lot of modern audiences
uncomfortable with its episodes of virulent prejudice, alternating
with a love story that seems almost like a fairy tale. This
production captures the lighter, sunnier hues of Shakespeare's
romance, but the darker shadows of the play elude both Hoffman and
Hall.
   The play opened to general praise from Broadway critics for
Hall's production, and also for Hoffman. All said James gives the
best performance.
   Clive Barnes of the New York Post said Hoffman ``triumphed _ a
deliberately modest triumph, but his own.'' He also praised Hall's
production for being ``refreshingly simple,'' making Shakespeare a
pleasure.
   Linda Winer of New York Newsday questioned Hall's production,
saying it was difficult to understand the balance between tragedy
and comedy. But she said Hoffman was ``the best thing'' about the
play.
   The Daily News' Howard Kissel was the only critic to flatly
criticize Hoffman. He said if Hoffman were an unknown actor, he
would not have won the part. He also faulted Hall's production,
calling it abrasive.
   Frank Rich of The New York Times said the production is
unexpected because romance and comedy are restored, making it
highly watchable. He said Hall's Shylock does not dominate as would
be normal in the play, but Hoffman's performance is ``a character
actor's polished gem.''

   The fighting had just broken out in Panama
City when a group of men dressed in civilian clothes and armed with
assault rifles surrounded the Marriott Hotel and began rounding up
guests.
   For the next 4{ hours, the men held us hostage, told us about
their comrades who had already fallen in the battle and threatened
to kill us.
   ``A lot of Panamanians have died, and we can kill you,'' one of
them told New York Times correspondent Lindsey Gruson. ``Don't
think we won't.''
   I had just checked into the hotel and come down to the sunken
terrace when I saw armed men running in a crouched position by the
swimming pool. Right about the same time I heard gunfire.
   It was about midnight, and the U.S. assault had started.
   I made for the hotel's main building with several other
reporters when a man with an assault rifle appeared and said, `Hit
the floor.'
   He herded us over into the lobby, which was full of people.
   The gunmen took peoples' passports, they searched my bag.
   About a dozen of the men took charge of me and 11 other
foreigners, including two other correspondents.
   I never saw more than 20 armed men in the hotel.
   They told us they had surrounded the building. `We're being
invaded, so we're taking hostages,' the man who appeared to be
their leader said.
   They did not threaten me personally, but they made it clear that
they could kill us all. There were about eight Americans in our
group.
   Gruson and I tried to persuade the men to let us call our
offices to tell the story of the invasion.
   We saw them herding the guests and staff into the grand
ballroom. A man in a silk bathrobe kept saying to the captors,
``I'm Chilean! I'm Chilean!''
   The armed men eventually let me retrieve my bag and notebook _
my money had been taken _ and they let me remain in the lobby.
   Gruson went upstairs where he said he was threatened by one of
the gunmen, who kept pointing his assault rifle at him. At one
point, the gunman put the muzzle of his weapon against Gruson's
mouth, he told me later.
   About 1:45 a.m., a few other hostages and I were herded into a
red van at gunpoint and driven to a private home in the wealthy
neighborhood where the Panmanian leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega, lives. We were ordered into the service area off the
kitchen and made to sit on the floor.
   Our captors let us have water and smoke cigarettes.
   We were there until 4 a.m. I kept hearing aircraft passing low
overhead, sporadic gunfire from automatic weapons. Things were
tapering off.
   Between 3:30 a.m. and 4 a.m., the phone rang three times.
   More hostage-takers showed up. Then a man who appeared to be
their leader said, ``We're going to let you go. We don't want to
kill you. Tell the truth about Panama. We're not killers.''
   ``There are hundreds of dead in the Central Barracks.''
   The men seemed very sad. One was crying.
   They put us back into a van and let us out in the street. I
raced to a private home and called the AP office.

   Here are some facts and figures on Panama:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Panama is an S-shaped tropical isthmus that links
Central America and South America. It is bordered on the west by
Costa Rica and on the east by Colombia. It is slightly larger in
area than the state of West Virginia.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ The country has 2.2 million people, 70 percent of
them a mixture of Spanish and Indian descendants. Fourteen percent
are West Indian, 10 percent are Caucasian and 6 percent Indian.
Spanish is the official language but English is widely spoken. The
main religion is Roman Catholicism.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE GOVERNMENT _ The government had been nominally headed by
provisional President Francisco Rodriguez, who took office Sept. 1.
But the real leader was Defense Forces chief Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega who last week assumed the title of head of state. He
inherited command of the military from Gen. Omar Torrijos, who
seized power in 1968 and died in a plane crash in 1981.
   Noriega engineered the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle
in February 1988. Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega, who was
indicted in Florida on federal drug trafficking and money
laundering charges. Noriega has denied the charges.
   The United States, which has continued to recognize Delvalle,
imposed economic sanctions on Panama in an effort to force Noriega
from power.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE CANAL _ The 51-mile Panama Canal, connecting the Atlantic
and Pacific oceans, was built by the United States from 1904 to
1914 on territory leased from Panama. Treaties signed by
then-President Carter and Torrijos in 1977 transfer control of the
canal and its defense to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   The 10-mile-wide canal zone was turned over to Panama after the
treaties went into effect in 1979.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Panama was a leading international financial
center with about 120 banks holding an estimated $30 billion in
assets. But a flight of capital caused by the political struggle
over Noriega's rule has sharply reduced assets to about $8 billion,
according to government figures.
   U.S. officials have complained that secret bank accounts the
country offered as business enticements helped make Panama a haven
for illegally laundered drug money.
   Opposition leaders say unemployment last year more than doubled
to 23 percent. The country's main crops are bananas, pineapples,
cocoa, corn, coconuts and sugar. The official currency is the
dollar, but it is called the balboa.

<HEAD>Man Kills Self, Trying to Donate Heart to Ill Brother; Fails</HEAD>

   A man who felt he was a failure committed
suicide outside a hospital in an effort to save a brother with
heart disease. But the body was found too late, and his heart could
not be used for a transplant.
   Gerald Olson, 46, drove his van Monday evening to University
Community Hospital in Tamarac and parked outside the emergency
room, authorities said Tuesday. Then he put a gun into his mouth
and pulled the trigger.
   Ten minutes passed before a nurse on her way home noticed Olson
slumped over the steering wheel. An emergency medical crew
administered heart massage, but he died less than an hour later.
   Police found suicide notes in the van in which Olson complained
of ``too many downs and no ups for me on this roller coaster ride
of life.'' Olson wrote that he wanted his heart donated to his
56-year-old brother, Bob Olson, who has been on a waiting list for
a heart transplant for nearly three years.
   ``His main purpose for (committing suicide) at the hospital was
to make his heart available for his brother,'' said Sheriff's
Detective Steve Wiley. ``Unfortunately, he failed.''
   ``It made me feel like someone special,'' Bob Olson said from
his home in Belvedere, Ill. ``He thought of me in his last
thoughts. He wanted somebody benefiting from his death.
   ``I love my brother,'' Olson added, sobbing. ``I'm going to miss
him.''
   The elder Olson, who was diagnosed as having cardiomyopathy,
which causes an enlarged heart, and other relatives said they
recognized Jerry Olson did not succeed in life as he might have
wished, but they said they had no idea he might be suicidal.
   ``I think he probably was capable of doing anything he wanted to
do. If he'd only gone and done it,'' said Roland Olson, 58, who
lives in Rockford, said of his younger brother.
   Instead, Jerry Olson worked in lounges and sold bar supplies. He
was unemployed in recent months. Jerry moved to Tamarac about eight
years ago to help a sister after her husband died of a heart
attack, Roland said.
   But three weeks ago, she asked her brother to move out,
according to Wiley. ``She thought it was time for him to stand on
his own two feet,'' the detective said. Since then, Jerry Olson had
lived in his van, Wiley said.
   On Sunday, Jerry Olson recorded a tape. An Elvis Presley fan who
named his daughter Lisa Marie, same as the singer's daughter, he
sang ``I'll be Home for Christmas,'' and in two letters asked that
the song be played at his funeral.
   To his daughter, Jerry Olson wrote: ``I'm so sorry it had to
come to this Honey, but lately there's been too many downs and no
ups for me on this roller coaster ride of life!
   ``I'm tired of everyone saying how much talent I've got. Uncle
Bob's got everything to live for! And if they find out he can use
it and Uncle Bob wants it, I'm going to be his donor Lisa! I figure
I could do more good for him than myself!''

<HEAD>Buchwald Says His Movie Idea `Stolen, Raped' by Studio</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Art Buchwald amused court spectators with his
wry humor but said there was nothing funny about what he called
Paramount Pictures' theft of his idea for the film ``Coming to
America.''
   ``It's very hard for a humorist to be taken seriously in
something like this,'' the Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist
testified Tuesday in his $5 million lawsuit against Paramount. ``I
feel this is a very serious matter. I feel my property has been
stolen, raped, whatever you want to call it.''
   Paramount contends there are no similarities between Buchwald's
idea and the hit movie starring Eddie Murphy. The trial was to
continue today.
   Asked by Paramount attorney Robert Draper if the studio's
chairman, Martin Davis, is a good friend of Buchwald, the humorist
said, ``He used to be.''
   Buchwald said Davis did not seem to know about the
breach-of-contract suit until the two encountered each other at a
party last year.
   ``The next thing I know a bottle of Dom Perignon arrives at my
desk with a copy of a recording called `Sue Me,''' Buchwald
recalled. ``I sent him back a note that said, `Anyone who sends a
bottle of Dom Perignon is guilty.'''
   Buchwald said Paramount optioned his story, ``It's a Crude,
Crude World'' in 1982, then changed its title to ``King for a Day''
and spent nearly $500,000 trying to develop it as a movie for
Murphy.
   Paramount abruptly dropped its option in 1985 and Buchwald and
his co-plaintiff, producer Alain Bernheim, took the idea to Warner
Bros., Buchwald told Superior Court Judge Harvey Schneider on
Tuesday, his second day of testimony in the non-jury trial.
   But Buchwald said that Warner Bros. dropped the idea in 1987
when word spread that Paramount was producing a similar story.
   Draper said he has decided against calling Murphy as a witness
in the case because of the ``circus atmosphere'' that accompanied
the appearance Monday of late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall.
   Hall testified that he and Murphy conceived the idea for
``Coming to America,'' in which Hall also starred. Murphy testified
likewise in a deposition.
   Buchwald's 2{-page script idea and ``Coming to America'' were
about an African prince who comes to the United States, lives in
the ghetto, falls in love and takes a bride back to his country.

<HEAD>Endara Sworn in Months After Being Declared President</HEAD>

   For the second time in seven months,
Guillermo Endara has been declared president of Panama, and once
again it comes amid violent clashes between his supporters and
those who back Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Endara, a portly, affable lawyer and former law professor, was
sworn in as president today after U.S. troops, in a bid to oust
Noriega, launched an assault on the country.
   His opposition activities date back more than two decades, to
when he served in the National Assembly under Arnulfo Arias Madrid,
Panama's grand old man of the opposition.
   Endara was Arias' spokesman in Panama until Arias died in Miami
in 1988 in self-imposed exile. He used to speak, amost dreamily, of
the day when Arias would return ``as a sign of providence'' to lead
the country.
   In May, Endara himself was chosen to lead the country in a
presidential election. Exit polls showed Endara and his two
vice-presidential candidates with an edge of about 3-1, but Noriega
nullified the results, ignoring the outcry at home and abroad.
   Three days after the vote, men wearing T-shirts of Noriega's
``Dignity Battalions'' battered Endara and his two
vice-presidential candidates in a bloody street scene captured by
foreign cameras.
   Endara spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed, recovering
from the attack.
   ``They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' Endara
said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied
guayabera, a short- sleeved, smock-type shirt favored by many
Latins.
   He staged a hunger strike to press Noriega to accept his victory
and urged his supporters not to accept the military man as their
leader.
   Endara, a veteran member of the Panamanista Party, ran very much
in the shadow of Arias.
   Endara lost control of the party in December to Hildebrando
Nicosia, who ran as a third-party candidate in May and finished
third.
   The opposition Liberal Authentic Party adopted Endara, and the
coalition Democratic Opposition Alliance ran him for president.
   Endara served twice in the National Assembly and was Arias'
minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when Arias was
thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days
as president.
   Endara went into hiding, was jailed for a time and eventually
fled to exile.
   When Arias reorganized his party as the Authentic Panamanist
Party in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in Panama,
Endara helped.
   Endara, who studied at the University of Panama, in Argentina
and in New York, lacked Arias' charisma and spent most of his time
behind the scenes of the opposition's seemingly endless attempts to
replace the de facto military power that began its iron-fisted rule
21 years ago.
   In a pre-election interview he put faith in the hope that the
democratic process in Panama would prevail, electoral fraud or not.
   He said if he won Noriega would be given a chance to leave
gracefully and be fired if he refused.
   
   Noriega hired and fired presidents pretty much at will after
taking over the military in 1983.
   His last victim was Eric Delvalle, who tried to fire Noriega
after the general was indicted on drug charges last year in the
United States. Even so, Endara said he trusted the democratic
process.
   ``Remember Delvalle was in very different circumstances,'' he
said. ``He was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984.
That's the price you pay for not being a democratically elected
person. You are subject to the decisions of the military.''
   He and his wife, Marcella, have one daughter, also named
Marcella.

<TEXT>
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman,
outlining the policies of India's new government, said today there
would be no compromises in tackling seccessionist campaigns by Sikh
and Moslem militants.
   In a speech prepared by Prime Minister V.P. Singh's government,
Venkataraman told a joint session of Parliament that new efforts
must be made to halt religious strife and corruption.
   The president, whose post is largely ceremonial, also said India
would retain friendly ties with the Soviet Union and United States,
seek to solve a border dispute with China and strengthen economic
ties with Japan.
   Singh, whose centrist National Front alliance took office after
forging a coalition with Hindu right-wingers and secular
communists, listened attentively in the front row of the Central
Hall of Parliament.
   Rajiv Gandhi, whose five-year tenure as prime minister ended in
the November election debacle for his Congress Party, took notes.
   Venkataraman, noting that voters had given ``a clear verdict in
favor of change,'' said the new government would strive to meet the
challenges ahead.
   ``The Punjab problem has defied solution so far,'' he said,
referring to the Sikh separatist movement that has claimed more
than 7,000 lives in the past six years and triggered the 1984
assassination of Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   ``There will be no compromise with separatism and no yielding to
extremists, but there is admittedly a compelling need for a
national endeavor to resolve the problem,'' the white-haired
president said.
   He said Singh's government would broaden the discussions it has
already initiated on finding a political solution for Punjab,
India's most prosperous farming state.
   The nationally televised, 15-minute speech set out a course of
action for government but gave few specifics. It was delivered in
the same Parliament hall where India's independence was proclaimed
at midnight on Aug. 14, 1947.
   Turning to Kashmir, where pro-Pakistan Moslems seek to secede
from India, Venkataraman vowed: ``There will be no compromise on
the country's unity, sovereignty and integrity.''
   The 2-week-old government of Singh has already had its first
serious challenge from Kashmiri militants. On Dec. 8, militants
kidnapped the daughter of Home Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, also
a Kashmiri Moslem.
   The young woman, a hospital intern, was released unharmed after
six days when the government freed five Moslem extremists.
   In a reference to Hindu-Moslem riots that claimed more than 300
lives this fall in other states, the president said: ``Violence has
no place in the land of Mahatma Gandhi, the apostle of
non-violence.''
   He was referring to Indian independence leader Mohandas K.
Gandhi.
   Venkataraman said that under Singh, whose chief campaign pledge
was to eradicate government corruption, legislation would be
introduced to appoint an ombudsman, or watchdog, whose jurisdiction
would include the prime minister.

   Waves of U.S. troops attacked
Panamanian military bases early today in an all-out bid to capture
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and break his tenacious hold on power.
   Mortar, machine-gun and cannon fire crackled across the capital,
and one hospital reported 50 dead and hundreds wounded. Noriega was
not captured and his bodyguard said he was in hiding, directing his
forces.
   U.S. troops were backed by warplanes and armored personnel
carriers and fighting raged into the mid-morning before Panamanian
resistance was quelled.
   By dawn, a pall of smoke lit by the flames of dying fires
covered the capital. Only sporadic firing could be heard, but
residents were warned to stay indoors and away from the fighting.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
in Washington that nine Americans had been killed in action, 39
were wounded and one was missing.
   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara, winner of May elections the
Noriega-controlled government nullified, was sworn in as president
and given immediate U.S. backing.
   President Bush, in a nationwide broadcast in the United States,
said Noriega was in hiding and ``the action is not over yet.''
   ``Tragically, some Americans have lost their lives in defense of
their fellow citizens, in defense of democray,'' he said. ``We also
regret and mourn the loss of innocent Panamanians.''
   The invasion by American troops is the violent climax of
Washington's long battle with the cagey military leader, who had
set up a succession of puppet presidents while running a military
empire that purportedly trafficked in Colombian cocaine.
   The bellicose Noriega survived two coup attempts, a losing
election, and tough U.S. economic sanctions while brashly flouting
Washington's futile attempts to break his grip on power.
   The Panama Canal, where about 30 ships cross the isthmus daily,
was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting, according to Panama
Canal Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon. He said landslides
had caused the only previous canal closings.
   The capital's sky was bright with the light of gunfire for
hours; blacked-out planes and helicopters roared overhead under a
full moon.
   The U.S. assault began about midnight as forces dispatched from
U.S. bases attacked Panamanian military headquarters, which
witnesses in nearby apartments said was in flames at 12:40 a.m. and
virtually destroyed by 2 a.m.
   American troops from bases in the United States were airlifted
in on Tuesday to augment the 12,000 soldiers based in Panama.
Powell said another 9,500 troops from U.S. bases were sent to
augment the force.
   Bush said Noriega's ``reckless'' behavior had ``created an
imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens living in Panama.''
   Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about
seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the
Panamanian base Fort Cimarron, about 20 miles from the capital.
   Noriega's main bodyguard, Lt. Asuncion Gaitan, spoke on the
national radio network after dawn to say that Noriega was ``well
and in a safe place.''
   ``Don't anyone give up your positions. In the provinces, prepare
to resist. The attacks are going to continue when they find we are
not going to cede,'' he said.
   Gaitan, who is well-known as Noriega's prime bodyguard and is
with Noriega whenever the general is seen in public, then gave a
series of messages using code names and instructions. The codes
mentioned names like ``Alex, Omar,'' or said, ``Alex, take the man
to the hangar and Yeyo.''
   Others were more comprehensible. One was a reference to the
so-called civilian Dignity Battalions of Noriega loyalists.
   ``Dignity Battalions operate in small operations during the day
or look for positions and mix with the people who support you and
at night move and act against the enemy positions in the periphery
of the city,'' ran one.
   Meanwhile, casualty reports were climbing. Dr. Marcel Pena of
the Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City said wounded had been
coming in all night and the number increased with daybreak.
   ``There are many more than 50 dead and an enormous number of
wounded,'' he said. Earlier, doctors had said there were at least
50 dead at the hospital.
   Hospitals were short of blood, surgical materials and other
supplies and were issuing international appeals for help, he said.
   Fighting after dawn was still continuing in Old Panama, just
east of the Marriott, and in San Miguelito, a poor district hill
district northeast of the city center where some of the strongest
Dignity Battalions are based. U.S. forces were apparently trying to
take the Panama Defense Forces barracks at San Miguelito and
helicopters were buzzing the area.
   On Friday, Noriega's rubber-stamp declared that the country was
in a ``state of war'' with the United States and named the general
head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a U.S. military
officer was shot to death by Panamanians in what American officials
called an unprovoked attack.

   Thirty-eight Latin American stablehands seized at
a racetrack a year ago have taken the Fifth Amendment, challenging
the government to prove they are illegal aliens. The government
says it doesn't have to to deport them.
   While illegal immigrants often don't know their rights and
prefer to go home rather than fight to stay, the Boston cases are
being regarded as a test of aliens' rights.
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ``is saying the
government doesn't have to come up with any evidence at all,'' said
attorney Susan Akram, who is orchestrating the aliens' defense.
``The INS has never brought a shred of evidence.''
   ``It's a test of what the government burden is,'' said Akram,
head of the Political Asylum Immigration Representation Project.
``Can the government haul anybody in off the streets and deport
them if they refuse to answer questions based on their
constitutional right not to do so? This is ridiculous.''
   The defendants were among 83 Salvadoran, Mexican, Brazilian and
Cuban stablehands rounded up Oct. 21, 1988 at Suffolk Downs during
a dawn workout.
   Of the 83 people, six were found to be in the United States
lawfully. Some went home, while others admitted their illegal
status and applied for asylum.
   The rest invoked their Fifth Amendment guarantee against
self-incrimination at their deportation hearings. They want the
government to prove they are here illegally.
   That isn't happening. Instead, INS attorneys are using an
argument allowed in civil cases: that silence alone is ground for
deportation.
   Charles Wheeler, director of the National Center for Immigrants'
Rights in Los Angeles, called this development alarming.
   ``It's disturbing if the immigration judge is making an
inference from their silence that a person is an alien,'' he said.
``It reverses the whole idea that you are innocent until proven
guilty.''
   But an INS official says the government is following precedent
well-established in civil cases.
   ``The government doesn't have to do any more,'' said Michael
Creppy, acting deputy counsel for the INS in Washington. ``This is
nothing new. The law is pretty clear in this matter. To me it's
just a tactic to be able to stay here.''
   Among the 38 aliens who invoked the Fifth Amendment was
21-year-old Salvadoran. His story is typical, said Akram, who
requested the man be identified only as Jay.
   One of 10 children in a farming family, Jay is from the
mountains of El Salvador, where the army and the anti-government
guerrillas have been waging war. He said both sides terrorize the
inhabitants.
   Jay told his attorney that by age 19, he was forced to act four
times as a lookout on a guerrilla patrol. He knew better than to
object after seeing a friend's face shot off for refusing to act as
a guerrilla informant.
   Last year, Jay fled, taking a bus to Mexico. From there, he
crossed the U.S. border undetected and made his way from California
to Massachusetts.
   Two months ago, Jay had his day in Immigration Court. The
attorney for the INS questioned him about where he came from and
how he got here.
   Jay replied in Spanish, ``I refuse to answer under the
protection of the Fifth Amendment of the United States because my
answer could incriminate me.'' The INS lawyer then asked the judge
to deport him.
   Jay's case is on appeal before the Board of Immigration Appeals.
   Wheeler said the use of the Fifth Amendment in deportation cases
is rare but crucial.
   ``It's an important defense and it would be a tragic betrayal if
this was taken away from aliens,'' he said.
   The INS' Creppy said the agency feels it will win.
   ``When you weigh the public interest versus the aliens'
interest, this is a case that is clear,'' he said.

   Opposition politicians said they
hoped the U.S. invasion of Panama would bring democracy to the
country, but supporters of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega called it
``genocide against Panama.''
   The U.S. decision to ``remove the obstacle of the dictatorship
was serious news, but we grasp it with hope,'' said Ricardo Arias
Calderon, who was sworn in as first vice president shortly after
the U.S. effort began.
   Arias, who spoke on the radio, was a vice presidential candidate
in the May 7 elections that were voided when results showed Noriega
opponents winning.
   Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president, and Guillermo Ford
was sworn in as vice president along with Arias.
   ``Tomorrow we will have the opportunity to celebrate the era of
democracy with justice and freedom,'' Endara said. He urged the
Noriega's Defense Forces, ``Don't resist, accept instead the peace
that they offer.''
   Ford said the military action ``grieves us because it involves
mourning and pain, but we pray to God that it will be the new
awakening of this nation we love so much.''
   Arias said he hoped ``with this action we can achieve the
Panamanian objectives, among them to immediately establish
democracy with full respect for the will of the people.''
   Noriega's Democratic Revolutionary Party held an emergency
meeting at an undisclosed site, said the government national radio,
broadcasting as the national resistance network.
   Carlos Duque, Noriega's presidential candidate in the May 7
elections, called on all ``nationalist parties'' to join in the
struggle.
   ``The United States has just committed the biggest error and is
going to pay for that,'' he said.
   Rigoberto Paredes, another party leader, called the U.S. action
an ``infamous invasion.'' He asked Latin American countries to tell
the United States ``to stop this genocide against Panama.''
   ``We are not going to surrender,'' he said.
   Not all those outraged by the invasion were Noriega backers.
   A woman in Diablo, just south of the U.S. Army base at Fort
Clayton, said: ``This is humiliating. I feel completely impotent.
My blood is boiling.'' She said she does not support Noriega but
also does not support the idea of a U.S. invasion.
   As she spoke, U.S. trucks passed on a nearby road and fighting
raged near Defense Forces headquarters.
   ``They are not going to enjoy it,'' she said.

   Here is the text of statements at the Pentagon
Wednesday by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and questions they fielded
at a news conference.
   
   Cheney:
   I think all of you have seen the president's statement
explaining the action that he ordered and explaining the background
and the rationale for it. Obviously, we've tried for more than two
years to resolve by peaceful means the difficult relationship that
had developed with the government of Panama.
   This past week it came to a head with the declaration of Manuel
Noriega as a maximum leader and his statement that a state of war
existed between Panama and the United States.
   That was, of course, followed by the shooting death of an
unarmed American off-duty Marine officer on Saturday and the brutal
treatment of other U.S. military personnel and dependents.
   On Sunday, the president made the decision to order U.S. forces
to Panama, specifically, as he indicated earlier, with the mission
of protecting American lives, of protecting American interests in
connection with our responsibilities under the Panama Canal Treaty,
with the effort being made also to restore democracy and to bring
Gen. Noriega to justice, should we capture him.
   The order went out late on Sunday to implement a plan that had
been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I
was briefed on when I became Secretary of Defense last spring.
   The plan was developed to deal with various contingencies that
might arise in Panama. We have always been concerned for several
months by virtue of the fact that there are large numbers of
Americans in Panama, not only those that are there because they've
been assigned there, because of their military role and
responsibilities, but also American civilians who live in the area.
   The operation is continuing at this time. Some of the reporting
we have, obviously, is still fragmentary. It's our intention this
morning in this briefing to give you as much information as we
reasonably can, given the fact that the operation continues.
   At this point, of course Gen. Noriega is still at large. He is
no longer the maximum leader in Panama. A democratic government has
been reestablished with the duly elected officials selected by the
people of Panama last May. He is, at this point, a fugitive.
   As Secretary, I want to thank all of those individuals who
participated in the operation. It has been carried out in an
extremely professional manner. I think they have performed superbly
in carrying out their duties and their responsibilities.
   And, at this point, I'd like, to turn the briefing over to the
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Powell.
   
   Powell:
   Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Let me add my own caution that the
operation is only seven hours old and it is still ongoing and may
be continuing for some time to come. So we're going to give you as
much as we possibly can, but please understand that there will be
details that I cannot get into for purposes of operational security.
   As you know, at the direction of the president, United States
armed forces undertook operations in combat in Panama just prior to
0100 hours this morning, or roughly just before 1 a.m. this morning.
   The participating units include in-place forces in Panama, the
193rd Infantry Brigade, which in recent months had been reinforced
by Marine units, by a battalion from the 7th Infantry Division at
Fort Ord, Calif., by a mechanized battalion from the 5th Infantry
Division at Fort Polk, La., as well as additional supporting forces
to include military police.
   In the course of the evening additional forces have been added,
and I'll describe how they have been added. Those additional forces
include a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division, two Ranger
battalions, selected special operating units.
   All of this, of course, was supported superbly by the United
States Air Force and the United States Navy, and there are
additional reinforcing units that will assist in stability
operations coming from the 7th Infantry Division at Fort Ord,
Calif., as well as from the 16th MP brigade at Fort Bragg, N.C. As
you know, our purpose, as stated by the president, is to protect
Americans, to protect the integrity of our treaty, to restore
democracy in Panama, and bring to justice the fugitive Mr. Noriega.
   We conducted operations this morning, beginning just before 1
a.m., in three general areas that Gen. Kelly will point out on the
map.
   First, in the central Panama Canal zone area, to the east of
that, near the International Airfield, and to the west down by Rio
Hato.
   Let me now turn to the larger map and discuss each one of these
pieces in turn.
   Let's start up on the Atlantic Caribbean side, with Task Force
Atlantic. Task Force Atlantic consisted of a battalion from the 7th
Infantry Division and a battalion from the 82nd Airborne Division,
which was in the Jungle Operations Training Center in Panama.
   Their mission was to secure several critical sites in the
southern portion of Task Force Atlantic AO _ the prison at Gamboa,
which was secured in the course of the morning and within which
there are some PDF personnel who had been put in jail as a result
of the coup attempt earlier in the fall, and we now have some 47,
48 very happy prisoners who have been released; the electrical
distribution center at Sierra Tigre is now secure; and Madden Dam,
a critical facility, is also secure.
   Other elements of Task Force Atlantic also ensured the security
of our installations in the Colon area, and they neutralized the
8th Infantry Company of the PDF, which did not take too active a
role in this operation, as well as neutralizing the naval infantry
unit, located up toward the north.
   There is still some sporadic firing up there. The situation
isn't completely resolved, but for the most part, Task Force
Atlantic has completed its assigned missions.

<HEAD>Communist Party Chief Criticizes Party's `Negligence'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Urbanek criticizing his Communist
Party for making mistakes. No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SYDNEY RUBIN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Karel
Urbanek today said the party leadership had made mistakes marked by
``negligence and irresponsibility'' that led the organization into
its worst crisis.
   Speaking to 1,500 delegates at a special party congress, Urbanek
also admitted his own guilt as a member of the ruling Politburo in
allowing hated hard-liners to remain in the party leadership.
   The party was expected to purge its ranks of many discredited
party leaders during the two-day meeting.
   The Communists have been rocked by two shake-ups in the
leadership to remove hard-liners and the loss of thousands of
members since the country's peaceful pro-democracy movement began
four weeks ago, changing the political orientation of the country.
   The congress, called to determine the party's future in the wake
of a revolution that swept a government led by non-Communist into
office, scrapped all its party statutes, which could pave the way
for a comprehensive organizational reform.
   Party spokesman Josef Hora told reporters the congress also
decided to divide the leadership duties between a general secretary
and a party chairman.
   Former Premier Ladislav Adamec, who resigned earlier this month
after failing to reach agreement with the opposition on a new
government, was thought to be a contender for one of the posts,
according to congress observers who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   On Nov. 24, the party ousted hard-line leader Milos Jakes and
others responsible for the crackdown on the ``Prague Spring''
reforms of 1968, and Urbanek replaced Jakes as party chief.
   The much despised Prague party boss, Miroslav Stepan, was ousted
two days later in a further leadership reshuffle that brought
unknown Communists to the top. Stepan's ouster was demanded by
massive protest rallies.
   Both Jakes and Stepan were later expelled from the party for
``serious political mistakes.'' They had refuted assertions by a
parliamentary commission that they were politically responsible for
a Nov. 17 police crackdown on peaceful student demonstrators that
ignited the ensuing democratic revolution.
   Urbanek said the ``party leadership manifested negligence and
irresponsibility worthy of punishment.''
   ``With self-criticism, I admit my part of the guilt in'' leaving
Stepan on the Poliburo, Urbanek said, adding that the decision was
``an extraordinary, politically serious mistake.''
   Outlining the crisis now faced by the party, Urbanek noted that
it had lost 66,290 of its 1.7 million members in the last month.
   Urbanek also revealed that the party faces bankruptcy,
disclosing that party dues were used to build recreation facilities
for the top brass ``about which the rank-and-file only learned
today.''
   The speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds
itself following the triumphs of the pro-democracy movement.
   The most recent victory came on Tuesday as the
Communist-dominated Parliament gave the new reform government a
vote of confidence, and endorsed opposition leader Vaclav Havel for
president.
   ``There is no doubt that the congress delegates have the duty
... to take the party out of its deepest crisis ever,'' the
Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said in a front-page editorial
today.
   Havel, a former dissident who emobdies the democracy movement,
said on the eve of the party congress that the party should become
``a modern political party which would participate as an equal
among equals in the pluralistic system...''
   Urbanek told Prague congress delegates Tuesday night that new
elections to the Politburo are not expected, but suggested it could
be replaced by a 21-member ``political executive committee.''
   Among the non-voting guests at the congress are former party
members expelled after the Soviet invasion of 1968 that crushed the
``Prague Spring'' Communist-led reforms.
   There are also 40 delegates from the new reformist Communist
Democratic Forum, a potential splinter group challenging Urbanek's
leadership which submitted a seven point list of demands.
   Earlier this week, the Democratic Forum spokesman, Rudolf
Prevratil, said ``the congress will show whether the movment can
live within the party.''
   The party was also likely to discuss the presidential elections.
Communist Premier Marian Calfa, who left for Moscow today and was
therefore not attending the party congress, gave an unprecedented
endorsement to Havel's candidacy.
   The parliament's presidium voted late Tuesday to reconvene the
house Dec. 29 at the presidential Hradcany castle to cast a public
vote for president. Havel is essentially the only candidate.

<HEAD>Former Black Panther Leader Gets Probation in Bad-Check Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Black Panther Bobby Seale has been put
on probation for a year for writing bad checks in a financially
disastrous venture to sell ribs at a barbecue festival.
   Seale, 52, also was fined $1,000 Tuesday and ordered to serve
100 hours of community service.
   He pleaded guilty Nov. 20 to four misdemeanor counts after being
charged with passing bad checks for more than $10,700 in ribs,
lodging and other expenses for his booth at Cleveland's National
Rib Cook-Off in 1988.
   ``I had no intention whatsoever to defraud,'' he told Common
Pleas Judge William Aurelius. ``I have a son in college ... I rent.
I've been trying to take care of my family. I do all kinds of
community service.''
   Aurelius noted that Seale has paid off his approximately $11,000
debt, which Seale said resulted from poor sales and
higher-than-expected expenses.
   Seale was co-founder of the radical Black Panthers in the 1960s
and was arrested with the Chicago Seven for allegedly conspiring to
incite the 1968 riots outside the Democratic National Convention in
Chicago.
   Seale helps teach disadvantaged youngsters to rebuild abandoned
houses in Philadelphia, where he is a community liaison for Temple
University, his lawyer said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: assigned missions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Let me turn now to Task Force Semper Fidelis, which is
essentially a Marine rifle company and a light armored Infantry
company, Marine as well as some additional MPs assigned to Task
Force Semper Fidelis.
   Their principal mission was to secure the Bridge of the
Americas, insure the security of Howard Air Force Base and environs
around Howard Air Force Base. Task Force Semper Fi has completed
their mission successfully.
   Let me turn now to Task Force Red, which is off to the west down
by Rio Hato. For those of you who were here on the third of
October, you'll recall that that was the location from which the
7th Company launched their operation to come to the assistance of
Gen. Noriega during the coup attempt in October.
   Because of the criticality of that facility as well as two
companies located there, a Ranger battalion parachute assaulted
onto that location at H-hour, just about 1 a.m.
   All the things I'm describing so far all took place
simultaneously about H-hour, 1 a.m. In the course of their
activities there, they succeeded in neutralizing Rio Hato. It is
under our control. Some of the members of the 6th and 7th Company
have dispersed away from Rio Hato, but we also took a number of
prisoners. So it is neutralized and Task Force Red has accomplished
its mission and is sweeping up in the area.
   If I could now turn into the Task Force Bayonet area in the
central section, the narrowest zone there. Task Force Bayonet
consisted of a Mechanized battalion, the force of the 6th
Mechanized. It also was supported by a platoon of light tanks as
well as the 5th battalion of the 87th Infantry.
   And the mission of Task Force Bayonet was two-fold really: to
provide security for our major facilities in the Task Force Bayonet
area of operations and the principal combat mission performed by
the Mechanized battalion was to seize the Comandancia, the
headquarters of the PDF, Gen. Noriega's headquarters, and that was
also done beginning at about one in the morning.
   They have accomplished that mission. The headquarters has been
reduced. There has been considerable burning. I'm not quite sure
how much of it has been burned out, but there has been quite a bit
of fire down there. But they, for the most part _ most part have
accomplished their mission.
   There is sporadic firing that continues in the area, and some of
the PDF members who were in the Comandancia have now slipped out
and are mixing in with the general population. And so there will
still be a need for mopping up and stability operations in support
of the new government.
   The forces that were opposing them in the vicinity of the
Comandancia are shown under the Comandancia listing, First Public
Order Company, Second Public Order Company, and elements of the
Sixth and Seventh Infantry, which I mentioned were out at Rio Hato.
   Then we also mentioned that as part of Task Force Bayonet,
another unit was flown across the entrance of the canal in order to
block the Fifth Infantry Company which is at Fort Amador, and at
the moment there is continuing work down there to completely
neutralize the Fifth Infantry Company.
   But for the most part, Task Force Bayonet has accomplished its
mission and is undertaking stability and sweep-up operations.
   Let me turn now to the East to Task Force Red. Task Force Red
consisted of another Ranger battalion which parachutists assaulted
in at H-hour. Their mission was to take over the international
airfield, get it ready for follow-on forces coming from the 82nd
Airborne, and begin to block access for Battalion 2000, which as
you know, also played an instrumental role in the events of Oct. 3.
   The Rangers landed on the ground, quickly seized the airport,
began to put out patrols to the East. They were assisted, and I
might add that throughout the area of operations, the special
forces group elements belonging to Southern Command have been
performing reconnaissance and surveillance, and some of those
reconnaissance and surveillance efforts cut out to the Pacora River
Bridge early and blocked that.
   here was some fighting out there but no main elements of PDF
units came down the road in the direction of the city, and the
Rangers are now out in that location as well.
   Beginning 55 minutes after H-hour, or about 1:55 this morning,
the first element of the 82 Airborne Division Ready Brigade
arrived, 10 C-141s, and they conducted a parachute assault onto the
international airfield in that vicinity.
   Ten C-141s arrived several hours later and at 0515 the second
half of the 82 Airborne Division parachuted in. And their mission
is sort of depicted by the arrows. They will move, one arrow going
out to make sure battalion 2000 stays where it is. Two other arrows
coming back into the direction of the city to assist with stability
operations and make sure the First Infantry Company and the Cavalry
Squadron you see depicted, remain neutralized.
   In order to continue our stability operations and to make sure
we really accomplish our mission of protecting Americans and
assisting the newly inaugurated government, additional forces are
being brought down from Fort Ord, Calif., the 7th Infantry
division, a brigade, and as I mentioned earlier, the 16th MP
brigade will be sending additional elements down.
   In the process of these operations we also took special actions
to immobilize the PDF navy. They have a small fleet of boats which
were immobilized. And we also took actions to immobilize aircraft
that could have been used for escape purposes.
   All of these actions that I have mentioned were marvelously
supported by Air Force and Army gunships; magnificent support from
the military airlift command, Tactical Air Command, and refueling
tankers from the Strategic Air Command, Special Operations units as
well as Special Forces reconnaissance and surveillance units.
   Let me mention a few specific events that I know are of interest
to you. There are reports of hostages. We are chasing these
reports. In some cases hostages were taken and then released.
   And I don't want to go into any numbers or details because this
is an ongoing operation, except to let you know that we are looking
into every one of these and we believe we have adequate resources
in the area to deal with that situation.

   President Bush, sensing an opening brought
about by a series of events last weekend in Panama, moved to end
almost two years of frustration by sending in the Marines to oust
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga from power.
   The operation may answer critics who ridiculed the decision to
stay off to the side during the failed October coup attempt, but
the early hours of fighting showed the attack was fraught with
military and diplomatic risk.
   Bush's initial concern is that Noriega be found by U.S. forces
quickly, with minimal loss of life, and brought to Florida for
trial on drug trafficking charges.
   In the early going, Noriega was elusive and American soldiers _
at least nine of them _ died. Some 7,000 soldiers and Marines were
sent overnight into Panama to bolster the 12,000 Americans already
stationed there.
   Substantial bloodshed could turn political and public opinion
against the Panama operation, especially if Noriega was to remain
at large. It wasn't clear from the initial reaction whether
Congress or the American public would support an operation that
involved extensive bloodshed and drags on inconclusively for days
or even longer.
   If the operation seems more like Vietnam than Grenada, Bush is
in trouble.
   Most of the initial congressional reaction was supportive. But
Sen. Claiborne Pell, a Rhode Island Democrat and chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said, ``Personally, unless very
clear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the Panama Canal
or against American people or installations, I would not have
engaged in such unilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without the
support of other Central American nations.
   The administration braced for criticism from many in Latin
America, given the aversion throughout the hemisphere to U.S.
unilateral action. Officials believed some would argue the
operation was a direct violation of the United Nations and
Organization of American States charters, both of which stress the
importance of non-interference in a country's internal affairs.
   In Bush's view, Noriega had to go and nothing else had worked.
   The United States had used an impressive array of weapons _
diplomatic, economic, political _ against Noriega for almost two
years but he seemed to be able to laugh off everything Washington
tried.
   Unlike Chinese leaders, Noriega was held in such ill repute that
he never was a candidate for a we-can-do-business-together visit
from national security adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   Noriega seemed entrenched, surviving repudiation by neighbors
and growing economic deprivation among his countyrmen. He called an
election, then threw out the returns when the results didn't please
him. When rebel officers had him in their clutches last October
during a coup attempt, Noriega managed to talk his way out of it.
   Since February 1988, Washington had been saying, ``Noriega must
go.'' But he wouldn't, and didn't.
   One key question mark is the degree to which President Guillermo
Endara is perceived as the legitimate leader of Panama.
   His strength is that he is seen as the winner of the May
elections but his burden is that he was sworn in as president an
hour before the U.S. military operations began in earnest this
morning.
   Another potential risk is that the 35,000 Americans living in
Panama, including U.S. servicemen, may be the targets of resentment
_ or worse _ from Panamanians who believe the invasion was uncalled
for.
   Is it possible the outrage among some Panamanians will be such
that acts of sabotage will be carried out against the Panama Canal?
   The irony of today's action is that when the Bush administration
took office, there seemed to be a greater disposition to try to
work in concert with other Latin American countries to solve the
Noriega problem.
   A U.S.-backed OAS mediation effort begun last spring with the
aim of achieving a democratic transfer of power collapsed in August.
   The impetus for direct U.S. action seemed to gain in October
when Bush was widely criticized for not acting more assertively in
support of the rebel insurrection against Noriega.
   If Bush was looking for an excuse to act, a series of events
starting last Friday gave him his opening. One was a Panamanian
government declaration of a ``state of war'' with the United States.
   Another contributing factor was the tense situation which
ensued, marked by the death of one U.S. serviceman and the
harassment of a U.S. Navy couple. In both cases, members of the
Panamanian military were involved.
   Bush had had enough, and the stage was set for the most
controversial decision of the Bush presidency.

<HEAD>Summary of Charges in Noriega Drug Indictment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's capture would enable U.S.
authorities to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges
brought against him in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   The indictments against the Panamanian leader were unsealed Feb.
5, 1988, and marked the first time federal charges were filed
against a foreign leader who was not in the United States.
   Fifteen other people also face charges in the case.
   Noriega could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than
$1.1 million in fines if convicted.
   The Miami indictment charges Noriega with conspiracy,
racketeering, importing drugs and traveling to further the
conspiracy. It accuses him of:
   _ Accepting a $4.6 million bribe from Colombia's Medellin drug
cartel to protect s
augment the force.
   Bush said Noriega's ``reckless'' behavior had ``created an
imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens living in Panama.''
   Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about
seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the
Panamanian base Fort Cimarron, about 20 miles from the capital.
   Noriega's main bodyguard, Lt. Asuncion Gaitan, spoke on the
national radio network after dawn to say that Noriega was ``well
and in a safe place.''
   ``Don't anyone give up your positions. In the provinces, prepare
to resist. The attacks are going to continue when they find we are
not going to cede,'' he said.
   Gaitan, Noriega's prime bodyguard, then gave a series of
messages using code names and instructions. The codes mentioned
names like ``Alex, Omar,'' or said, ``Alex, take the man to the
hangar and Yeyo.''
   Others were more comprehensible. One was a reference to the
so-called civilian Dignity Battalions of Noriega loyalists.
   ``Dignity Battalions operate in small operations during the day
or look for positions and mix with the people who support you and
at night move and act against the enemy positions in the periphery
of the city,'' ran one.
   Meanwhile, casualty reports were climbing. Dr. Marcel Pena of
the Santo Tomas Hospital in Panama City said wounded had been
coming in all night and the number increased with daybreak.
   ``There are many more than 50 dead and an enormous number of
wounded,'' he said. Earlier, doctors had said there were at least
50 dead at the hospital.
   Hospitals were short of blood, surgical materials and other
supplies and were issuing international appeals for help, he said.
   Fighting after dawn was still continuing in Old Panama, just
east of the Marriott, and in San Miguelito, a poor district hill
district northeast of the city center where some of the strongest
Dignity Battalions are based. U.S. forces were apparently trying to
take the Panama Defense Forces barracks at San Miguelito and
helicopters were buzzing the area.
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council prepared to meet in
emergency session Wednesday morning to debate the U.S. military
attack. Nicaragua requested the emergency meeting.
   On Friday, Noriega's rubber-stamp declared that the country was
in a ``state of war'' with the United States and named the general
head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a U.S. military
officer was shot to death by Panamanians in what American officials
called an unprovoked attack.

   The Soviet Union today swiftly condemned the U.S.
military assault to seize Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega,
while British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher praised it as a
``courageous decision.''
   ``Someone has to uphold democracy,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Reactions contrasted sharply as news flashed around the world
that President Bush had ordered troops to capture Gen. Noriega, who
was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in the United States in
1988.
   Among other Western allies, Dutch Foreign Minister Han van den
Broek said in a radio interview that he sympathized partly because
U.S. troops had been endangered recently in the Panama Canal zone.
   Tensions had been rising in Panama between U.S. and Panamanian
forces after Panamanians killed a U.S. Marine lieutenant on
Saturday in what American officials called an unprovoked attack.
   Foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Peru,
Venezuela and Colombia conferred by telephone on the situation,
then agreed to meet in Bogota tonight to discuss the developments
in Panama and issue a declaration, the Colombian Foreign Ministry
announced.
   Panama was part of the so called Latin American Group of Eight
but was excluded after Noriega ousted Panamanian President Eric
Delvalle in 1988.
   The group has condemned Noriega's regime, but it has also
advanced a consistent rejection of any direct intervention of the
U.S. in Panama.
   Canada expressed regret today about the use of force by the
United States in Panama but was sympathetic to the American action
under the circumstances.
   A statement from External Affairs Minister Joe Clark also said
that ``intervention by force is a dangerous precedent,'' adding
that Canada notes that the United States relied on force as a last
resort after failing to resolve the situation in Panama peacefully.
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain said he
``deeply lamented'' the U.S. action. He said the Spanish
government, ``which always has been opposed to foreign military
intervention, expresses its hope that the Panamanian people can
decide their future in freedom.''
   Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama of Japan said he hoped the
confrontation would end soon.
   ``Japan has long been expressing its hope to see a democratic
government established in Panama that reflects the will of the
Panamanian people,'' the Kyodo news service quoted Nakayama as
telling Japanese reporters. ``We hope this takes place as soon as
possible.''
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev said,
``These actions, a violation of the U.N. Charter and generally
recognized rules of state relations, should be condemned by the
international community. The United States must immediately stop
its armed intervention in Panama.''
   Perfiliev, quoted by the official Tass news agency, said the
U.S. action, ``whatever its motivation, has provoked a feeling of
serious concern in the Soviet Union.''
   State-run Radio Moscow accused the United States of invading
Panama in what in called ``an act of aggression.''
   Yugoslavia also said the U.S. action was unacceptable.
   ``Yugoslavia has always considered as unacceptable any foreign _
and especially a military _ intervention under any excuse, as it
represents a crude violation of sovereignty,'' a Yugoslav Foreign
Ministry statement said.
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke to reporters on the steps of her 10 Downing
Street office after Bush telephoned at 7 a.m. (2 a.m. EST) to tell
her the military assault was under way. They spoke for 10 minutes.
   ``I said we would fully support him in the action he was taking
to bring an end to this rule of terror,'' Mrs. Thatcher said. ``I
believe he was right to do so. I believe this is what friends are
for, to give support at this time. It was a courageous decision.''
   Mrs. Thatcher called on other world leaders to declare support
for Bush, saying, ``Every action has a risk and it is important
that it be successful.''
   ``Gen. Noriega is wanted on drugs allegations in the United
States. We are fighting terror and the battle against drugs as
well. The rule of democracy should be upheld,'' she added.
   Mrs. Thatcher's warm response contrasted with her sharp
criticism of the U.S.-led invasion of Grenada in 1983 to topple a
leftist administration in the Caribbean island. Grenada is a former
British colony that regards Britain's Queen Elizabeth II as its
titular head of state.
   Britain's opposition Labor Party criticized the U.S. action,
saying it had ``nothing to do with democracy in Panama and
everything to do with protecting the American interests in the
canal zone.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: that situation.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   With respect to General Noriega, as you know, we're only seven
hours into this operation. We have not yet located the general. He
has a habit of changing locations in normal times four or five
times a night.
   But we will continue our efforts to locate him. But, as a
practical matter, we have decapitated him from the dictatorship of
this country and he is now a fugitive and will be treated as such.
   With respect to the embassy, the American embassy did take some
fire in the course of the evening. Nobody was injured. There was
some minor damage to the embassy. And we have US forces in strength
at the embassy to secure it.
   As you know, there is a new government in place. And I will talk
briefly about the casualty figures. As you know, this is
preliminary, and I want to reemphasize that the numbers I'm about
to give you are preliminary and are subject to change as we move in
the course of the morning and get better information.
   At the moment, the figures I have from the Southern Command
provide the information that nine Americans were killed in action.
Thirty-nine Americans were wounded in action. One American is
missing.
   Several aircraft were damaged. They include several C-130s and
some helicopters and I have no information that I'm comfortable
with PDF casualties to provide at this time.
   That concludes my briefing.
   
   Q: Gen. Powell, do you see the need to send further
reinforcements or are we seeing all of the forces that are going to
be necessary?
   Powell: The forces I mentioned that are being sent in now for
reinforcement, the Seventh Division and the MPs, I think that'll do
it. I think that'll bring it up to around 24,000 and that's really
not for sustained combat but for stability operations to make sure
that we are truly controlling the situation.
   Q: ... 24,0000, you're sending in or does that include ...
   Powell: No, that's total including those that were there to
begin with.
   Q: So that includes the ones that are in now, Gen. Powell ...?
   Powell: Yes, total.
   Q: or the ones that will be in?
   Powell: That includes all that we are planning including those
that are in the reinforcement package coming. And that is, as you
know, a number that can float around as we adjust our plans in the
course of the day.
   Q: How many have been sent in so far?
   Powell: There were 13,000 to begin with _
   Cheney: who were already there.
   Powell: who were already there as part of Southern Command
assets before the operation began overnight and so far we have
introduced close to another 7,000 and we have roughly 2,500, I
believe, on the way, from the Seventh Division and the 16th MP
Brigade.
   Q: Gen. Powell, what about members of the 82nd Airborne and some
of the Army Rangers who were brought in. I know you say you want to
get them out as quickly as possible. When can we expect that they
will be sent home?
   Powell: Well, the primary mission right now is to make sure the
situation is under control and we have satisfied our objectives and
then as soon as that is as we would like it to be and we're sure
that things are settled down, we will start to retrograde those
soldiers as quickly as possible, but I don't have a specific
timeline yet.
   Q: Gen. Powell ... Do you have any evidence that Noriega was
about to threaten the operations of the Canal?
   Powell: I have heard those reports. He has been saying this for
years and years so those reports would not surprise me. But I don't
know that I want to get into specific reports.
   Q: (Inaudible)
   Powell: Nothing that came to my attention that caused me great
concern. We had deployed our forces in a way that provided, I
believe, adequate protection of the Canal.
   Q: Gen. Powell, can you tell us where President Endara was sworn
in, who did it? I mean, tell us a little bit about that scenario.
Can you?
   Powell: He was sworn in shortly before the operation. I don't
have the details and I think I'd better _ I need to refer you to
the State Department for those kinds of answers. It was a
Panamanian. He was sworn in by a Panamanian justice of some kind
and it was done an hour before, but with respect to ...
   Q: At an American base?
   Powell: Yes. But I really need to refer you to State Department,
because it was handled by the State Department.
   Q: Gen. Powell, what assurances do you have that Noriega isn't
going to escape into the countryside and organize some kind of
guerrilla operations to keep harassing US forces down there?
   Powell: Oh, he can do that, and we will chase them and we will
find him.
   Q: Do you know that he's still in the country?
   Powell: No, I don't know that. We _ he is a very canny
individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to survive
catastrophe. And we'll see over time whether he survives this
catastrophe.
   Q: General, now wouldn't he make life miserable for the U.S.
forces down there?
   Powell: I doubt it. No. I don't think, one, it's been some years
since General _ Mr. Noriega, the fugitive, has been seen in the
jungle, living in the jungle. He's used to a different kind of
lifestyle, and I'm not quite sure he would be up to being chased
around the countryside by Army Rangers, Special Forces and Light
Infantry units of the Joint Operations Training Center. But you
might _ I can't rule that out, but I think that's rather far
fetched.

   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _President Bush ordered American troops into action in Panama to
``protect American lives, restore the democratic process, preserve
the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties and apprehend Manuel
Noriega.''
   _Almost 9,500 additional soldiers, including paratroopers, were
flown in from the United States to supplement the 12,000 troops
based in Panama.
   _U.S. troops backed by warplanes and armored personnel carriers
attacked Panamanian military headquarters in Panama City and other
military bases.
   _Noriega was not captured and was said to be in hiding,
directing his forces.
   _At least nine Americans were killed in battle with hostilities
still under way. Preliminary reports said more than 40 other people
were killed, but the toll was expected to rise.
   _Opposition leader Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president
and the United States recognized his government.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Communists Approve Documents on Split with Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lithuanian Communists overwhelmingly
approved a resolution today calling for an end to their
subordination to the Soviet Communist Party.
   A final vote on formally establishing a fully independent
Lithuanian Communist Party was delayed by several hours of debate
on procedural questions.
   By a vote of 838-142, the Lithuanian Communist Party congress _
meeting in the capital, Vilnius _ approved a resolution calling for
``relations of equal partnership with the Soviet Communist Party,
other progressive parties, public organizations and movements.''
   Lithuanian Communists, who supported a legislative move Dec. 7
to strike the leading role of the party from the Baltic republic's
constitution, are spurred by the need to compete with the
grass-roots political movement Sajudis and other newly formed
parties in local elections Feb. 24.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, general secretary of the Soviet
Communist Party, has appealed to Lithuanian Communists not to break
away, saying a split will damage his reform efforts.
   A formal break would run counter to more than 80 years of
Communist Party practice and policy. Since before the 1917 Russian
Revolution, Vladimir I. Lenin demanded a unified party covering the
entire territory of the czarist empire. In 1921, the party outlawed
the existence of factions.
   Sajudis observers say local Communist Parties in other republics
such as Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Armenia could follow
Lithuania's example soon and present Gorbachev with a splintered
party when he convenes the 28th national party congress in the fall.
   Delegates also approved on a vote of 850-139 a separate
declaration saying Lithuania's Communist Party's relations with the
national party must be based on ``mutual understanding,
restructuring of the Soviet Communist Party and the results of the
28th Soviet Party Congress.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON: the actions.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Well, when you went into Grenada you had _ we had support
right at the outset, the people were brought in to say they
supported this action. But here, you're not able to say that at
this point?
   Cheney: Well, this was a different situation.
   Q: Why?
   Cheney: I mean, there's always a tendency to want to compare
this operation with the last operation, and obviously, both are
military operations. But in the case of Grenada, there were no U.S.
forces present on the Island; we were invited by the governments of
the Eastern Caribbean to come in and provide support. In the case
of Panama, there is a major U.S. presence there; we are in Panama
with significant military force because we have a right to be under
the Panama Canal Treaties. It's just a different set of
circumstances. In this case the president felt very strongly, and
this was the basic justification for undertaking the operation,
that it was necessary in order to safeguard American lives and, at
the same time, to restore democracy to Panama.
   Q: Will this hurt us, though, with other Central American
countries _ once again, Uncle Sam imposing his will?
   Cheney: Well I would hope not. I would hope that other Central
American countries would recognize that what we have done is to
participate in the removal of a drug trafficker, a man who was a
dictator, a self-described Maximum Leader of Panama, a man who had
brutally treated not only Americans but also Panamanian citizens, a
man who had annulled the last election and defied the will of the
people of Panama to be governed by Mr. Endara, and that our action
is justified and will produce a democratic government in Panama. I
think that's a _ the way for it to be viewed, and I would hope that
other governments in the hemisphere recognize the reasons why the
president took the action and the result that will come from it.
   Q: Mr. Secretary, following the failed coup in Panama, you came
into this room and you made a number of arguments justifying our
decision not to get more heavily involved. You pointed to the risk
of inserting American forces in Panama City, and you said it wasn't
up to the United States, I think as you put it, ``To the
willy-nilly around the world knocking off governments, this was
something the Panamanians would have to do for themselves.'' Why is
your earlier assessment, which you made in this room two months ago
not valid anymore?
   Cheney: No, I am not sure I'd agree with your assessment of my
earlier assessment, but I think that there were significant changes
as a result of the actions of the past week, and that what was
different was that on Saturday, for example, an unarmed American
officer was shot and killed by the PDF, that this came about after
Gen. Noriega had had himself declared Maximum Leader and then
indicated that a state of war existed between Panama and the
government of the United States. I think we as a government bent
over backwards to avoid having to take military action. I think the
record is replete with the patience and forbearance of the United
States government in this instance. When it reached the point
however, when it was clear that American lives were at risk, when
it reached the point where it was clear that Gen. Noriega had
created an environment in which his troops felt free to terrorize
and brutalize Americans who had every legitimate and lawful right
to be in Panama, that was a fundamentally different set of
circumstances.
   Q: Mr. Secretary ... what sort of threat do the `dignity
battalions' now pose for these operations?
   Cheney: I'd defer to the general on that.
   Powell: Well, we're watching them carefully. It's not clear _
it's not clear how many of them are real battalions and how many
are just thugs and rabble rousers that would simply melt away. They
have not caused us any difficulty yet, but they have the potential
of sniping and things like that.
   Q: Isn't the fact that there are so many _ there are 23,000 U.S.
citizens in Panama, some dependents, some of military personnel
living there, there, do you think this is a particularly dangerous
operation, and what was done to protect them?

<HEAD>Important Records Missing in Detroit Police Fund Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators looking into what happened to $1
million paid out of a Police Department undercover operations fund
said important documents on a former deputy chief suspected of
stealing from the account have vanished.
   The missing documents detail Kenneth Weiner's involvement with
the fund, Executive Deputy Chief James Bannon said Tuesday.
   ``He's gone. The records are gone. ... He was last known to be
the custodian'' of most of the documents, Bannon said.
   Police Chief William Hart has said Weiner, a former civilian
deputy police chief, stole from the fund, which finances undercover
operations of the narcotics division.
   Weiner was in charge of sensitive security work for the police
from 1980 to 1986. He resigned in 1986 after an investigation into
a precious-metals investments deal in which several Detroit-area
investors lost several thousand dollars.
   Weiner has not been seen or heard from publicly since the
federal and city investigations began several weeks ago. The FBI
has refused to discuss the scope or any other details of its
investigation into the fund.
   The FBI and U.S. attorney's office are trying to determine
whether Weiner diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the
fund for personal use.
   Bannon said a substantial number of documents were gone,
including some subpoenaed under federal and city orders. He said a
theft report was filed.
   The City Council subpoenaed financial records from 1985 to 1987,
and city auditors began examining documents Tuesday.
   Release of the records averted a court battle between Mayor
Coleman Young and the council, which had issued a subpoena
demanding a chance to review the records.
   ``The mayor's concern all along was to protect the integrity of
the grand jury process and the integrity of the secret service
fund,'' said spokesman Bob Berg.
   Young, who initially said he never would give the documents to
city auditors and the council, refused to say why he changed his
mind.

   A lawyer for Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said today
the Panamanian leader would die rather than surrender to U.S.
forces sent to bring him to this country to face drug charges.
   Panamanian exiles here celebrated the U.S. attack.
   Noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in Miami and in
Tampa in 1988. Attorney Raymond Takiff said he talked with the
general Monday evening.
   ``We discussed various things, including this very real
possibility (of U.S. military action),'' the Miami lawyer said in a
telephone interview.
   The attorney said he had planned to fly to Panama City this
evening to meet with Noriega. This morning, he spoke with members
of the general's staff who didn't know his whereabouts.
   ``He's a fighter,'' Takiff said. ``I feel unhappily secure in my
belief that he will be killed, he will not be captured. Should that
occur, the truth will never come out.''
   Takiff questioned news accounts that Noriega had declared war on
the United States, which he described as ``just some more
propaganda that's come across again out of context.''
   U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, assigned as the trial
judge in the Miami indictment, said today: ``If General Noriega is
apprehended and brought here for trial, he would be given the same
treatment as any other person accused of a crime _ no more, no
less. All his rights will be protected.''
   Also closely following events were members of Miami's Panamanian
exile community, including Luis Endara, cousin of Guillermo Endara,
who won the country's May election but was blocked by Noriega from
taking power. Guillermo Endara declared himself president shortly
after the U.S. military action began.
   ``I can assure you 99.99 percent of all Panamanians are up. I
know of at least five parties going on (in Miami),'' Luis Endara
said in an early-morning telephone interview.
   He added that he had been in telephone contact with Panama.
   ``Many of the opposition's key people have taken refuge in safe
places since we had reports way back from before the elections of
May that the dignity brigades (armed citizens who support Noriega)
had lists of key opposition people to attack should something like
this happen,'' he said.
   Convinced the military action would be a success, Luis Endara
predicted many Panamanians living in this country would return to
their homeland afterward.
   ``Exiles will probably return to Panama once everything is back
to normality,'' he said. ``We will probably see for the first time
an emigration back to a country that has been liberated.''
   Another Panamanian in Miami said that if Noriega is captured, he
will have to ``face all the things that he has done to the
Panamanian people.''
   ``I think he owes to the Panamanians many things and this is the
first thing we have to face,'' said Aurelio Barria, founder of the
National Civic Crusade in Panama. ``We would like to find the truth
of all the cases pending and try him in Panama.''

<TEXT>
   Cheney: Well, I think a key part of the plan that Gen. Powell
may want to address was to wrap up the PDF as quickly as possible,
if you will, and to provide security for the Americans living in
the area. We reached the judgment that, in the long run, Americans
were going to be more secure, that their safety was likely to be
greater, the risk likely to be reduced if we acted now rather than
if we waited and let the situation continue to spiral out of
control.
   Q: Mr. Cheney ... do you think there will be additional
casualties as the mopping up continues?
   Cheney: I don't have any way to know that. I don't have any way
to know.
   Q: What are the last pockets of resistance? Can you run over
that, Colin, and tell us?
   Powell: Oh, there is a little bit at the Comandancia, just some
sniping coming out, and we still have a slight problem down on Fort
Amador area with the 5th Infantry company. But that's pretty much
it. There's a little bit of firing out by the Pacora River Bridge,
but it's really not ...
   Q: The MO has basically been for resistance, and then they sort
of break up and fade off into the neighborhoods? Is that ...
   Powell: That's what we have seen.
   Q: How do you deal with that, in the days or hours ahead here,
if you have a lot of armed people who at least formerly were
pro-Noriega.
   Powell: What we have to find out is whether or not they are an
armed resistance force or just individuals who now are just
criminals and thugs running around the countryside. We'll just have
to wait and see how it plays out.
   Q: Do you have large numbers of PDF now willing to work with
you? Have you begun the liaison?
   Powell: We'll still sorting out the pieces. We have a fairly
significant number of detainees, I'll call them for the moment, and
we'll sort that over time _ sort that out over time. You've just
got to bear with us. We're only a few hours into this.
   Q: Gen. Powell, you've said several times that Noriega, Mr.
Noriega personally is a fugitive. Yet Panamanian broadcasts suggest
that he's still running the show militarily. What have you got to
indicate that he is in fact a fugitive on the run?
   Powell: Because he is a fugitive. We're looking for him. He's
not running anything, because we own all of the bases he owned
eight hours ago.
   Q: How convinced are you that you will get Noriega, and will you
call this operation a success if you don't?
   Powell: I'm not a fortune teller as to whether we will get him,
or when we will get him. I think the operation is a success already
because we cut off the head of that government and there is a new
government that was elected by the Panamanian people, waiting,
willing and ready to take over. And I hope that's what will happen.
I hope what we will do is assist them in standing up and taking
over, and I think the people of Panama will rally to this
government.
   Q: General, would you say that the operation has lasted more
than what you expected? Did you intend it to be a more a surgical
strike, or do you think ...
   Powell: I had no set timelines in mind. I really wasn't sure. It
could have been over quickly. It could linger for days or weeks. I
just don't know, and I'd just be wildly speculating with you at
this time. I'll know better later in the day, I think.
   Q: Does that mean the operation _ the operation isn't over and
we need to get _ (inaudible)
   Q: Have we communicated with the Soviet Union, and did they
protest?
   Cheney: I'll direct you to the State Department.
   Q: Thank you all very much.
   Powell: Could I just say that I hope you recognize how
complicated an operation this was, and how competently it was
carried out by the Armed Force of the United States. We all, the
Secretary and I, all of our associates, deeply regret the loss of
American life. But that's sometimes necessary in pursuit of our
national interests and in the fight for democracy.
   Thank you.

   John Bushnell, the highest-ranking
U.S. official in Panama, said today that there will be fear among
Panamanians until Gen. Manuel Noriega is captured or otherwise
removed from the scene.
   ``Having him loose does raise the potential that he might raise
more mischief,'' said Bushnell, the U.S. charge d'affaires. ``I
have the concern that until he is in custody, there is still going
to be a great deal of concern and fear among the Panamanians.''
   Bushnell made his comments to a group of reporters at a heavily
guarded fort on the outskirts of the city.
   ``Noriega may take to the hills and be very hard to find ...
(but) he wouldn't have a significant force to actually do
anything,'' Bushnell said. ``He will get very little support from
the people.''
   The news group from Washington was shuttled to the fort by
helicopter from Howard Air Force Base only 10,000 yards from where
the briefing was held because the military considered it unsafe to
drive.
   The reporters were given six copies of a videotape of the
swearing-in of Panama's newly elected leadership.
   The officials themselves were in hiding because it was still too
risky for them to appear anywhere in public, Bushnell said. He
would not disclose their whereabouts.
   The three Panamanian leaders _ considered by the United States
to have won an election last May _ met with Bushnell on Monday
evening and were told of the U.S. military plan. They approved of
it in a letter to President Bush, Bushnell said.
   The officials _ President Guillermo Endara, and Vice Presidents
Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford _ were sworn in at an
undisclosed site early Wednesday as the military action was getting
under way.
   The oath was witnessed by two officials of Panama's human rights
association, because no Panamanian government official could be
enlisted to participate.
   Bushnell raised the possibility that Noriega could slip into
Nicaragua or Cuba. ``He may be in the embassies right now,
hiding,'' he said.
   The U.S. Embassy was hit by one or possibly two rounds believed
from a rocket-propelled grenade launcher in Wednesday's fighting.
   The new Panamanian government was hoping to go soon to the
presidential house once the fighting is over. The leaders were
welcoming U.S. help they had eschewed earlier because of the
experience and aftermath of the Oct. 3 coup attempt against Noriega.
   ``There weren't too many Panamanians left with guns who were
willing to do it,'' Bushnell said. ``When Noriega is captured,
there will be an immense sigh of relief.''

   The leftist Sandinista government put
its armed forces on maximum alert today, mobilized troops and tanks
and called the U.S. invasion of Panama ``a serious threat to
Nicaragua.''
   Large howitzers were set up in the center of downtown Managua
and Red Beret special forces in camouflage uniforms were posted at
the international airport.
   President Daniel Orgega declared a ``state of national alert''
and asked for an urgent meeting of the U.N. Security Council. In
New York, the Security Council agreed to meet in emergency session
today.
   Ortega also sent messages to the Non-Aligned Movement and Pope
John Paul II saying he was ``deeply concerned by the invasion of
Panama.''
   ``In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Panama, it is a threat to
the peace and security of all Latin America, Central America and
especially constitutes a serious threat to Nicaragua,'' Ortega said
in a communique read on Voice of Nicaragua radio.
   The army was put on a ``state of combative general alert.'' The
communique said that implied immediate deployment of land, sea and
air combat units. Reserves and civilian militia also were called up.
   Reporters saw Soviet-made T-55 tanks moving through the capital.
At least 20 howitzers were set up in the old shell of the city
center, flattened in the 1972 earthquake and fires, and never
rebuilt.
   ``When the world is demanding dialogue, peaceful solution of
conflicts and renunciation of the threat and use of force ...
actions like those that are causing destruction and death in our
sister state of Panama threaten the security and precarious
stability of the Central American region,'' said the communique.
   In declaring the state of alert, the government mentioned U.S.
invasions of Nicaragua earlier this century and continuing
confrontation over U.S.-supported Contra rebels in the past 10
years.

<TEXT>
   Here is the text of President Bush's address
to the nation Wednesday on U.S. military action in Panama.
   
   Fellow citizens, last night I ordered U.S. military forces to
Panama. No president takes such action lightly. This morning, I
want to tell you what I did and why I did it.
   For nearly two years, the United States, nations of Latin
America and the Caribbean have worked together to resolve the
crisis in Panama. The goals of the United States have been to
safeguard the lives of Americans, to defend democracy in Panama, to
combat drug trafficking and to protect the integrity of the Panama
Canal Treaty.
   Many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through
diplomacy and negotiations. All were rejected by the dictator of
Panama, General Manuel Noriega, an indicted drug trafficker.
   Last Friday, Noriega declared his military dictatorship to be in
a state of war with the United States and publicly threatened the
lives of Americans in Panama. The very next day forces under his
command shot and killed an unarmed American serviceman, wounded
another, arrested and brutally beat a third American serviceman and
then brutally interrogated his wife, threatening her with sexual
abuse. That was enough.
   General Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in
Panama created an immminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens
in Panama. As president, I have no higher obligation than to
safeguard the lives of American citizens. And that is why I
directed our armed forces to protect the lives of American citizens
in Panama, and to bring General Noriega to justice in the United
States.
   I contacted the bipartisan leadership of Congress last night and
informed them of this decision, and after taking this action, I
also talked with leaders in Latin America, the Caribbean, and those
of other U.S. allies.
   At this moment, U.S. forces, including forces deployed from the
United States last night, are engaged in action in Panama. The
United States intends to withdraw the forces newly deployed to
Panama as quickly as possible.
   All forces have conducted themselves courageously and
selflessly, and as commander-in-chief, I salute every one of them
and thank them on behalf of our country.
   Tragically, some Americans have lost their lives in defense of
their fellow citizens, in defense of democracy, and my heart goes
out to their families. We also regret and mourn the loss of
innocent Panamanians.
   The brave Panamanians elected by the people of Panama in the
elections last May, President Guillermo Endara and Vice Presidents
Calderon and Ford, have assumed the rightful leadership of their
country.
   You remember those horrible pictures of newly-elected Vice
President Ford covered head to toe with blood, beaten mercilessly
by so-called ``dignity battalions.''
   Well, the United States today recognizes the democratically
elected government of President Endara. I will send our ambassador
back to Panama immediately.
   Key military objectives have been achieved. Most organized
resistance has been eliminated. But the operation is not over yet.
General Noriega is in hiding. And nevertheless, yesterday, a
dictator ruled Panama, and today, constitutionally-elected govern _
elected leaders govern.
   I have today directed the secretary of the Treasury and the
secretary of state to lift the economic sanctions with respect to
the democratically elected government of Panama, and in cooperation
with that government, to take steps to effect an orderly unblocking
of Panamanian government assets in the United States.
   I am fully committed to implement the Panama Canal Treaties and
turn over the canal to Panama in the year 2000. The actions we have
taken and the cooperation of a new democratic government in Pamana
will permit us to honor these commitments.
   As soon as the new government recommends a qualified candidate,
Panamanian, to be administrator of the canal, as called for in the
treaties, I will submit this nominee to the Senate for expedited
consideration.
   I am committed to strengthening our relationship with the
democratic nations in this hemisphere. I will continue to seek
solutions to the problems of this region through dialogue and
multilateral diplomacy.
   I took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every
other avenue was closed and the lives of American citizens were in
grave danger.
   I hope that the people of Panama will put this dark chapter of
dictatorship behind them and move forward together as citizens of a
democratic Panama with this government that they themselves have
elected.
   The United States is eager to work with the Panamanian people in
partnership and friendship to rebuild their economy. The Panamanian
people want democracy, peace, and the chance for a better life in
dignity and freedom. The people of the United States seek only to
support them in pursuit of these noble goals.
   Thank you very much.

   A campus detective says he waited five
years for the other shoe to drop _ make that shoes, dozens of shoes.
   That's what happened Tuesday when Herb Hanson of the University
of Wisconsin police questioned a 33-year-old Iowa man who admitted
taking side trips to Wisconsin and Illinois for five years to steal
shoes from students at campus libraries.
   Most of the shoes taken were men's penny loafers and deck shoes
that students had kicked off while working.
   The man, identified as an assistant business professor at a
private college, said he took shoes from libraries at UW-Madison,
Illinois State University-Normal and the University of Illinois at
Champagne-Urbana, Hanson said.
   Hanson would not identify the man but said he had been convicted
of theft in a missing shoe case at Illinois-Normal in July and is
seeing a therapist.
   During six weeks in 1988, 12 pairs of shoes were stolen from the
two UW-Madison libraries. Typically, a student would get up to get
a drink of water and return to find his shoes gone. Police stepped
up patrols in the libraries with no success.
   The break in the case came after shoes was stolen from a student
Dec. 9, Hanson said.
   The victim and a friend saw a man hanging around at the library
with a pair of shoes sticking out of his backpack and questioned
him, Hanson said. The shoes were not the student's, but the man
identified himself with an Iowa driver's license.
   When two more thefts were reported the same day, Hanson tracked
down the man.
   Police found 80 pairs of shoes in his apartment.
   The man claimed he had purchased 60 of them. Hanson said the man
told him if the shoes he took fit, he kept them. Others he donated
to charities.
   No charges were immediately filed. At least 34 unsolved shoe
theft cases are pending in Madison, Hanson said.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany tried to reassure opponents of German reunification today
and said their fears of an evil German empire based on past horrors
are ``absurd.''
   Kohl, during a news conference closing a triumphant two-day
visit, also said he expects a treaty expanding East and West German
ties to be completed by May.
   Kohl met with Communist Premier Hans Modrow on Tuesday, and the
two later announced plans for the treaty and a number of other
changes:
   _The famed Brandenburg Gate, isolated in East Berlin since the
Berlin Wall was built in 1961, will be reopened by Christmas.
   _Germans will be allowed to travel without visas between the two
states beginning Christmas Eve.
   _East Germany will free all political prisoners, with many to be
released before Christmas.
   Kohl pledged to take into account the concerns of other European
countries as the two German states, created after World War II,
move closer together.
   ``It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live
together,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl pledged to avoid ``destabilization,'' a reference to the
power vacuum in East Germany that has followed the virtual collapse
of Communist Party control here since a popular revolution began in
the fall.
   Kohl added: ``Fears based in the past are understandable, but
there is nothing to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk
about a Fourth Reich.''
   East German Communists and other opponents of reunification have
said joining the two states could create a ``Fourth Reich,'' and
have reminded people of the atrocities of Nazi dictator Adolf
Hitler's Third Reich.
   In meeting with several opposition groups, including New Forum,
Democratic Awakening, and others, Kohl said he heard none of them
voice opposition to eventual reunification.
   New Forum representative Arnold Vaatz told the official news
agency ADN he found ``broad agreement'' with Kohl and that his
group was ``thankful'' for the results of the summit.
   Earlier today, Kohl met with the Roman Catholic bishops of
Dresden and Berlin, Joachim Reinelt and Georg Sterzinsky.
   Sterzinsky said he and Reinelt explained their views on future
cooperation with West Germany in the meeting with Kohl.
   Sterzinsky said he expects West Germany to ``treat us as a
partner and help with our renewal.'' He viewed the visit by Kohl, a
conservative Christian Democrat, as ``entirely positive,'' the
official news agency ADN reported.
   West Germany's Bild newspaper quoted unidentified officials in
Dresden as saying Berlin's Brandenburg Gate will be open to
pedestrians Friday. The newspaper said its report would appear in
Thursday's editions. It was sent in advance to other news media
today.
   The Brandenburg Gate is a symbol of German unity to millions and
was a centerpiece of a major Berlin thoroughfare before the wall
was built 28 years ago.
   Under the pressure of massive pro-democracy demonstrations
starting in October, openings have been made in the wall, two sets
of Communist leaders have been ousted, and free elections are
scheduled in May. At the same time, West Germany has warmly
accepted all East German refugees and offered to help revive its
neighbor's struggling economy.
   At a joint news conference after their summit, Kohl and Modrow
said their talks had made progress toward what the two nations
refer to as a ``treaty community.'' Such an arrangement would
safeguard the sovereignty of both states.
   Talks leading up to the planned bilateral treaty could focus on
improving traffic connections, telecommunications and pollution
problems, Kohl said.
   Both leaders agreed to meet again in late January or early
February in West Germany.
   While Kohl stressed the ``right of self-determination'' for
citizens in both Germany on the issue of reunification, Modrow
called for the continued existence of two German states.
   Kohl joined his host in counseling caution and patience.
   Later, Kohl received an emotional welcome from a crowd of about
20,000 at an outdoor evening rally.
   People repeatedly burst into wild cheers, applause and chants of
``Unity!'' ``Unity!'' as Kohl addressed them as his ``countrymen.''
   Many waved West German flags, outnumbering those carrying signs
insisting on East German sovereignty or attacking Kohl.

   A Soviet rocket blasted off today carrying the
first U.S. scientific experiment to the Mir space station.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said the Progress M-2
cargo rocket lifted off on schedule at 6:31 a.m. and was
functioning normally. It is scheduled to dock with the Mir in two
days.
   Along with food, water and 90 pounds of New Year's presents for
two Soviet cosmonauts on the Mir, the rocket carries an experiment
for growing protein crystals in space, developed by Payload Systems
of Cambridge, Mass.
   Flights of the U.S. space shuttle are too short to grow many
kinds of crystals, whereas on Mir, the Soviet orbital platform
launched in February 1986, they would have months to develop. Such
research has applications in the development of pharmaceutical
products and the improvement of existing drugs.
   The crystal-growing experiment is to begin aboard Mir on Dec. 25
and run for 56 days. It will be returned to Earth Feb. 24 in a
Soyuz-TM capsule.

   President Bush told the American people today
that he sent American forces into a surprise overnight assault in
Panama to end a ``dark chapter of dictatorship'' by Manuel Antonio
Noriega and forestall a ``grave danger'' to the 35,000 Americans
living there.
   Bush ordered American forces to apprehend Noriega so he could be
put on trial in the United States on charges of drug trafficking,
but he acknowledged that Noreiga remained at large.
   ``We will chase him and we will find him,'' vowed the nation's
top military officer, Gen. Colin Powell. He said reinforcements
flown to Panama and those on the way would bring the U.S. force
there to 24,000.
   Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said nine
Americans were killed in action, 39 were wounded and one was
missing. He said he did not know how many Panamanians had died.
   The Pentagon codenamed the mission ``Operation Just Cause.''
   In a nationally televised Oval Office speech at 7:20 a.m. EST, a
somber Bush said, ``I took this action only after reaching the
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of
American citizens were in grave danger,'' Bush said.
   The White House said the decision had been reached Sunday, after
an American Marine officer was shot and killed outside Noriega's
military headquarters.
   Bush offered this explanation:
   ``General Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans
in Panama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American
citizens in Panama. As president, I have no higher obligation than
to safeguard the lives of American citizens. And that is why I
directed our armed forces to protect the lives of American citizens
in Panama, and to bring General Noriega to justice in the United
States.''
   But while key military objectives had been achieved and most
organized resistance eliminated, Bush said, ``the operation is not
over yet. Gen. Noriega is in hiding.''
   ``Nevertheless, yesterday a dictator ruled Panama and today
constitutionally elected leaders govern,'' the president said.
   One intelligence source on Capitol Hill said there had been
reports in recent months of a deterioration in Noriega's mental
state, including increased paranoia and constant drinking. But the
source cautioned that the reports were not based on hard evidence
and he discounted their importance as a factor in the launching of
today's military action.
   U.S. officials noted that leaders of a failed coup attempt last
October had said Noriega had been drinking heavily and Powell said
he had heard reports that Noriega had been threatening operations
of the canal.
   After his speech, Bush signed an order lifting U.S. economic
sanctions against Panama and directing ``an orderly unblocking of
Panamanian government assets in the United States.''
   Separately, Bush issued a memo to the Pentagon specifically
authorizing U.S. forces to apprehend Noriega ``and any other
persons in Panama currently under indictment in the United States
for drug-related offenses'' and to turn them over to U.S. law
enforcement officials.
   However, his declaration that Noriega had so far eludd the grasp
of American forces left the overall success of the military mission
in question.
   Bush said Guillermo Endara, who won last May's election in
results that Noriega refused to accept, was hastily sworn in as
president of Panama. And he said he was committed to implement the
Panama Canal Treaties and surrender control of the canal to Panama
in the year 2000.
   Bush's swift action stood in contrast to his inaction last
October, when he kept U.S. forces on the sidelines while some
Panamanian generals sought to oust Noriega in a coup. Bush drew
heavy congressional criticism at that time.
   As evidence, Bush noted that Noriega last week declared his
``military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the United
States.'' He also recited a series of events in Panama over the
past few days, including the fatal shooting of an American military
officer.
   ``Tragically some Americans have lost their lives in defense of
their fellow citizens, in defense of democracy,'' the president
said. He expressed his condolences to their families and said he
regretted that some innocent Panamanians also had been killed.
   Bush said the forces flown overnight to Panama would be
withdrawn ``as quickly as possible.'' Powell said nearly 7,000
additional soliders and paratroopers had arrived from stateside
bases and 2,500 were en route this morning to supplement those
troops based in Panama.
   Bush said he informed congressional leaders and U.S. allies
about his decision.
   Sen. Jesse Helm, R-N.C., predicted, ``The majority of the Senate
will feel good by this turn of events.'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said Bush's action ``was made necessary
by the reckless actions of Gen. Noriega.''
   But Sen. Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said, ``I would not have engaged in such
unilateral or such go-it-alone action'' without the support of
other Central American nations.
   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States,
called at the request of Noriega's envoy, Endara issued a statement
asking the organization to recognize Lawrence Chewning Fabrega as
its ambassador to the OAS. The statement was faxed to the OAS from
the U.S. Army South headquarters in Panama, according to the
sign-off.
   Noriega's representative, Jose Maria Cabrera, stayed in the
chair designated for his country. ``I am the representative of the
Republic of Panama, and I denounce this criminal aggression,'' he
told a reporter.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the administration
sent a cable to Soviet officials informing them of the action. The
Soviets swiftly condemned the move as a violation of the United
Nations charter.
   Bush said the United States had tried repeatedly _ but
unsuccessfully _ to use diplomacy and negotiation to remove Noriega
and that it was now recognizing the ``democratically elected
government.''
   The president spoke after only a few hours of sleep. He had
stayed in the Oval Office until a few minutes after 4 a.m. to
monitor developments in Panama, and was in time for his speech that
began shortly after 7 a.m.
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and other top aides also were at the White House for much of the
night.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Powell were in the Pentagon's
military command center.
   Beginning with Bush, the administration did what it could to
preserve secrecy of the operation before Fitzwater's dramatic
announcement about the military action. The president hosted a
White House Christmas party attended by reporters, but gave no hint
of the impending action.
   U.S. military intervention in Central America is a tradition of
long standing _ including President Reagan's decision to invade
Grenada in 1983 and overthrow a leftist government.
   Bush had hinted at military action earlier in the week, when he
told interviewers, ``I think a president, all presidents, have
options, but they don't discuss what they might be.''
   First Reagan and then Bush have been trying to force Noriega's
ouster since 1988, when the Panamanian leader was indicted in this
country on federal drug trafficking charges. The United States
imposed stiff economic sanctions against Panama in hopes of
dislodging him from power.
   The situation in Panama had been jumpy for days. Tuesday
afternoon, the Pentagon spokesman said a U.S. soldier used an
unauthorized weapon when he shot a Panamanian police officer
Monday. He called the incident ``very regrettable'' but said it had
to be considered in the context of a deteriorating situation.

   AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories says it has
developed an integrated circuit that can turn a computer chip's
single-lane processing of information into a busy freeway.
   The photonic integrated circuit opens the way to vastly more
powerful computers, the company said Tuesday.
   It will enable scientists to build optical computer systems,
which would use light pulses as well as electricity to transmit
information, AT&amp;T said from its Solid State Technology Center near
Allentown.
   ``The results may be very important to everyone, once they start
happening'' within a few year to a decade, said Leo Chirovsky, a
research scientist at Bell Labs in Murray Hill, N.J. He cited
weather forecasting as a possible application.
   The device has 2,048 elements, each of which can switch on or
off in less than one-billionth of a second when illuminated by a
low-power light beam.
   If one thinks of a computer chip as a city, computers until now
have been designed on the premise that information comes in and
goes out on narrow roads, Chirovsky said.
   ``This is the equivalent of providing a huge, multi-lane highway
on a chip that will promote a whole new way of looking at
computing,'' he said.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said today that
plans for a U.S. military invasion of Panama, carried out today in
the predawn ``Operation Just Cause,'' had been in the works since
before he took office last spring.
   Cheney and other administration officials called the 1 a.m. EST
invasion a success even though its initial attempts to capture
Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had failed.
   The Pentagon, on President Bush's orders, sent 7,000
paratroopers and other soldiers from U.S. bases to Panama in a bid
to oust Noriega and bring him to this country to face
drug-trafficking charges.
   Nine American servicemen were killed, 39 injured and one
reported missing in the operation, which pulled together more than
20,000 U.S. infantrymen, paratroopers, Marines, airmen and sailors.
   ``I think this operation was a success already because we cut
off the head of that government and there is a new government that
was elected by the Panamanian people, waiting, willing and ready to
take over,'' said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff.
   He added that he believed the people of Panama will rally to
support the new leaders installed under U.S. auspices.
   ``We have not located the general. But as a practical matter, he
is a fugitive and will be treated as such,'' Powell told reporters
at the Pentagon. ``This reign of terror is over.''
   Cheney said, ``The order went out late on Sunday to implement a
plan that had been in existence for some time. It was one of the
first items I was briefed on when I became secretary of defense
last spring.''
   ``We hope to be wrapping up General Noreiga in the future,''
Cheney said. ``As the president has said, we have achieved the bulk
of our objective.''
   Powell, the nation's top military officer, said sporadic sniping
continued from Noriega's former headquarters and that there was ``a
slight problem'' near Fort Amador where the Panamanian 5th Infantry
was located. Most of the remaining action consisted of putting down
the remaining forces loyal to Noriega.
   ``We're into mopping up and chasing down those ... who have not
yet decided to give it up,'' the general said.
   Powell said the U.S. forces were determining whether the firing
was coming from ``an armed resistance force, or just individuals,
who are now just criminals and thugs running around the
countryside.''
   In a nationally broadcast address from the White House shortly
before the Pentagon briefing, President Bush said he had ordered
the invasion to protect American lives and install an elected
government in place of Noriega, who faces drug-trafficking
indictments in the United States.
   Powell said 7,000 troops had been sent from the United States
overnight to augment the 13,000 U.S. troops based near the Panama
Canal and that 2,500 more were arriving later in the day. Some
forces parachuted into action.
   The general said the invasion, dubbed ``Operation Just Cause,''
simultaneously used airborne Rangers, paratroopers, infantrymen,
Marines and light tank units to attack the central headquarters of
the Panamanian Defense Forces, as well as several other military
bases and airports.
   The bulk of the forces came from the 82nd Airborne Division from
Fort Bragg, N.C., and the 7th Light Infantry Division from Fort
Ord, Calif.
   They were transported in south by huge Air Force C-141 transport
planes, which had been landing in Panama throughout the night.
   Powell said the U.S. forces encountered opposition from local
forces ``throughout the area of operations,'' but that the invasion
went smoothly.
   ``I hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was and
how competently it was carried out,'' he told reporters.
   Asked whether Noriega would become a fugitive leader of
rebellious troops that would harass U.S. forces, Powell said:
   ``He can do that, and we will chase him and we will find him. He
is a very canny individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to
survive catastrophe, and we'll see over time whether he survives
this catastrophe.
   ``It's been some years since General _ Mister _ Noriega, the
fugitive, has been seen in the jungle. He's used to a different
kind of lifestyle. I'm not quite sure he would be up to being
chased around the countryside by Army Rangers, Special Forces and
light infantry units,'' Powell said.
   The general said the American deaths came ``as a result of
firefighting,'' but could offer no further detail. He said U.S.
officials ``deeply regret the loss of American life.''
   Powell said he did not have a reliable number for the number of
Panamanian troops killed in the overnight invasion. He said that in
addition to the American casualties, some U.S. cargo planes and
helicopters were damaged.
   The general said there had been reports that some American
civilians had been taken hostage and that U.S. forces were looking
into each incident, but that he had ``no numbers or details to
provide'' about them.
   Powell detailed the parachute drops and assaults that resulted
in American forces occupying ``all the bases'' that had been manned
by the Panamanian military.
   Cheney and Powell met with reporters after a night-long vigil in
the Pentagon.

   A woman who says she was forced to go outside
her office to speak Spanish has filed a discrimination suit,
charging her former employer's English-only policy insulted
Hispanic employees.
   Ivette Gonzalez, a former probation counselor at the Salvation
Army, contended she was forced to resign in 1986 for failure to
abide by a ban on speaking of Spanish during breaks.
   ``They said the only way I could speak Spanish during lunch was
to go outside the building,'' said Mrs. Gonzalez, 34, a native of
Puerto Rico. ``I felt humiliated.''
   Ms. Gonzalez said the policy caused heart palpitations and
emotional distress. She is seeking more than $10,000 in damages and
reinstatement or reimbursement for lost wages in the suit filed
Monday in federal court.
   Her bilingual ability helped her get the job in 1986 with the
Salvation Army, which supervises people on probation for
misdemeanors.
   Two months later, center director Carroll Hepperle ordered
employees to stop speaking Spanish except when conversing with a
Spanish-speaking client, she said.
   Hepperle said English-only rule was issued because some
employees heard nothing but Spanish and felt they were being talked
about. Also, he had been told that some distasteful conversations
were overheard by Spanish-speaking employees, he said.
   ``We're not here to discriminate against people. We're here to
help people,'' he said.

   A team of FBI and Drug Enforcement
Administration agents was dispatched to Panama today to help
American forces round up fugitives wanted on U.S. criminal charges,
the Justice Department said.
   In addition to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, there are a number
of other fugitives from U.S. law, said Justice Department spokesman
David Runkel.
   ``We will round up as many people as we can who are wanted in
this country on charges, many of them drug-related,'' Runkel told
reporters.
   A team of more than 10 FBI and DEA agents was being sent to
Panama to help U.S. military authorities make the arrests, Runkel
said.
   Noriega and 16 associates were named in two 1988 federal
drug-trafficking indictments returned by grand juries in Miami and
Tampa, Fla.
   Runkel said Noreiga is accused of making $10 million by shipping
cocaine and marijuana from Colombia through Panama to the United
States.
   If Noriega is captured, Runkel said, the Justice Department
would try him first on the Miami charges. The Miami indictment,
returned Feb. 4, 1988, accuses Noriega of receiving more than $4.6
million to protect cocaine shipments from Medellin, Colombia, that
were shipped to this country through Panama.
   Under an opinion issued last month by the Justice Department's
Office of Legal Counsel, U.S. military forces overseas have the
power to arrest and detain criminal suspects.
   The opinion, which Runkel said was not issued in response to
preparations for a Panama invasion, will empower U.S. forces to
help round up criminal suspects such as Noriega.
   Runkel, meanwhile, offered a legal justification for the U.S.
invasion in Panama, saying Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
``believes there is a legal basis for this action being taken under
U.S. law.''
   The attorney general met with President Bush on Tuesday to
discuss the operation and give his legal advice, Runkel said.
   Runkel cited the ``inherent right of self-defense'' in Article
51 of the United Nations Charter and the right of the U.S.
government to protect its citizens, military installations and
institutions under Article 21 of the Organization of American
States treaty.
   The Panama Canal Treaty also empowers the United States ``to
protect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations,''
Runkel said.
   The spokesman said that ``the democratically elected government
of Panama was consulted prior to and welcomed the action taken by
the United States.''

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country:
   Dec. 18
   Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram on military cuts:
   As the Defense Department budget shrinks in response to the
improving climate of superpower relations and the unravelling of
the Soviet Union's satellite system in Eastern Europe, intense
internecine warfare already has erupted among the different
branches of the U.S. military over the available bucks.
   That is evidenced in the reaction of Marine Corps planners to
Army plans to trim down and tailor its forces. ... The Marine Corps
contends that the Army would be trespassing upon its mission and
attempting to do something that the Marine Corps can do better. ...
   By 1995, Army personnel would be reduced from 764,000 to
630,000. About 70,000 of the 220,000 troops now stationed in Europe
would be brought home. More emphasis would be placed on airborne,
air assault and light infantry divisions, effectively transforming
the Army into a contingency force capable of being deployed
worldwide.
   Far beit from mere civilians to decide which point of view is
the more correct militarily. But it doesn't take a general to
figure out that the real quarrel is about how the reduced Defense
Department pie will be sliced.
   Over the years, interservice rivalry has bedeviled defense
budgeting. With the cutbacks that are coming, however, the separate
branches may be forced to take a more comprehensive view of
national security needs and learn to fit their plans into the big
picture.

   The Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune on open skies:
   Almost 30 years after American pilot Gary Powers was brought
down by a surface-to-air missile as he flew a U-2 spy plane over
the Soviet Union, NATO, at U.S. urging, is prepared to allow
overflights by Warsaw Pact aircraft. This could be a major break in
East-West tensions provided that the proposal works both ways.
   It was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who proposed a policy of
``Open Skies,'' but the Soviets, mired in their traditional
paranoia, rejected the idea. Today, while nothing seems out of the
question, it still will require a major attitude adjustment by the
Soviets if overflights are to become routine military activity. ...
   Here is a chance for the Soviets to prove that glasnost extends

   The Free Press, Mankato, Minn., on U.S.-China relations:
   When it comes to diplomacy, George Bush believes in the personal
touch.
   Bush prepared for the Malta summit with a series of telephone
calls to other world leaders, and it's generally conceded that the
president's penchant for handwritten notes, phone chats and
informal get-togethers has eased the frictions that are inevitable
even between allies.
   But sometimes Bush puts too much stock in such methods. Such is
the case with China.
   Bush was the envoy to Beijing for a while in the 1970s, and he
believes that he and China's leaders are personal friends.
   Bush's eagerness to overlook the bloodshed under the nose of
Deng Xiao-Ping is pathetic.
   Bush is all too eager to forget about this spring's violence in
Tiananmen Square. At the behest of the Chinese government, he
vetoed a bill that would allow Chinese students already in the
United States to stay _ even though most of them face a dangerous
future should they return home today. ...
   Bush wants business as usual with China. The problem is that as
long as Deng and his cohorts run the show, business as usual comes
down to death and repression. We can do better than that.
</TEXT>

   Dec. 15
   The Courier-Tribune, Asheboro, N.C., on U.S.-China relations:
   Last June when the Chinese authorities brutally quashed
students' peaceful protest for democracy in Tiananmen Square,
Americans were horrified. ...
   (W)hen President Bush sent three diplomatic officals to meet
with the Chinese authorities, we were incredulous.
   Acting under unfortunate aplomb, Bush saw a need for our country
to inform Chna on the happenings of the Malta summit. And
apparently that need eclipsed the memory of June's massacre: Bush's
move comes off as a slap in the face of the student protesters who
lost their lives on June 4 and in countless executions since.
   America cannot continue to cry democratic wolf. As a nation, we
support and defend democracy and human rights around the world _ in
the Philippines, Central America and Eastern Europe. ...
   Yet our top officials also take tea with top-level Chinese
officials, a move that sends a worldwide message that all is well
on the Chinese-American front.
   The President cannot undo his diplomatic lapse of reason, but
America can try to temper the negative ramifications of this visit.
We can continue economic sanctions begun last June against China.
Congress can override Bush's veto of a bill that would have allowed
Chinese students fearful of returning home to stay in America. And
Bush can keep his diplomatic officials out of Chinese conference
rooms.
   Otherwise, what's to prevent the rest of the world, particularly
as the nations of Eastern Europe cut their democratic teeth, from
doubting the sincerity of our support?

<TEXT>
   A new church chime that rings and plays
hymns during the day frightens dogs and birds and wakes small
children from their naps, says a neighborhood group that wants the
electronic bells silenced.
   ``It's like having a grandfather clock with monster speakers put
in the middle of your home without your permission,'' said Vaughan
Pritchett, who lives two doors away.
   Pritchett said Monday the three couples who sued tried to
negotiate with Bellshire United Methodist Church for two months but
could not reach a compromise. He said he regrets the holiday timing
of the suit, but he wants the Christmas hymns and other melodies
toned down.
   The carillon was installed in September with $7,700 donated by a
former church member in memory of her son, said the Rev. Stephen
Smith, pastor at Bellshire.
   The bells are played from four speakers each day until early
evening. They strike the hour six times a day and play hymns three
times.
   ``We have half a dozen people who live as close to the church as
these people do, who love the carillon,'' he said.
   ``We could raise the volume a lot higher, but we're respecting
the neighbors,'' Smith said. ``We did respect the neighbor who goes
to bed early, and we quit striking the hour at 7 p.m.''
   A letter filed with the lawsuit from Walter H. Collins, a public
health environmentalist, said a test in September showed the bells
were louder than a typical freight train heard from a distance of
100 feet.
   A court hearing was scheduled for Jan. 3.

   The Pittsburgh Press on personal saving habits:
   One discouraging aspect of the remarkable U.S. economic boom of
the 1980s was the decline of personal saving among wage earners.
Fortunately, that trend is slowly being reversed.
   As a percentage of gross national product, the personal savings
rate in the United States has risen from less than 4 percent in the
mid-1980s to 5.4 percent this year.
   But Americans still lag behind other industrialized nations in
their saving habits. During the presidential campaign, George Bush
promised to encourage saving, and now his administration is
considering a number of proposals to fulfill the pledge. They may
be onto something.
   The proposal currently floating around the White House and
Treasury Department, for inclusion in the 1991 budget, is
tentatively called the Family Savings Account. It would allow
people of all incomes to contribute as much as $5,000 a year to
their account; after 10 years, the interest and dividends would be
tax-exempt, although the money could be ... withdrawn. ...
   The plan should be attractive to policy-makers. Because
exemptions wouldn't begin for 10 years, loss of revenues to the
government would be incremental and more easily predictable. The
$5,000 ceiling would draw more money into the savings pool than
other plans, including the IRA, which sets a $2,000 limit per year.
And unlike IRAs, in which savings aren't released until retirement,
the family accounts would allow acxcess to savings much sooner.
   If the plan has a fault, it's that it doesn't go far enough. ...
   We know how Washington hates to lose money. But if greater
personal saving is the goal _ and it's a good one _ bolder ideas
may be in order.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on handgun control:
   James Brady is right: Congress is gutless on handgun control.
   Speaking before a Senate committee, President Reagan's former
press secretary, who was shot and permanently injured during John
Hinckley's 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, charged that
Congress is cowed by the National Rifle Association from passing
reasonable gun control laws.
   One proposal, which is named after Brady, would require a
nationwide seven-day waiting period and a police background check
for all handgun purchases to make sure the buyer had no criminal
record or was not mentally ill. A week's delay in picking up a
handgun is not unreasonable.
   The NRA and its allies on Capitol Hill argue that such a law
would ``victimize innocent sports people.'' Nonsense. The
inconvenience would be minimal and the benefit could be the saving
of hundreds of lives.

   The Greenville (S.C.) News on the Philippines:
   The serious domestic problems in the Philippines have raised
questions about continued American support for (President Corazon)
Aquino. In the midst of the coup, the Bush administration provided
limited military support for her beleaguered government. Since then
questions have been raised about whether it's wise for the United
States to strongly ally itself with Aquino's troubled
administration.
   It should be noted that there is a difference between support
for Aquino and support for democracy. The point of American aid to
the Aquino government is that it backs a popularly elected
government in the face of an attempt to overthrow it by military
force.
   If democracy survives in the Philippines, the people will have
an opportunity to turn out Corazon Aquino and her government at the
polls. American policy is quite properly based on helping to ensure
the Philippine people have that chance.
   After decades of repression under the dictatorship of Ferdinand
Marcos, freedom in the Philippines is especially fragile. The
United States, in keeping with its long and close relationship with
the Philippines, has an obligation to aid the continued development
of democracy in that country.

   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on Leona Helmsley:
   As Newsweek magazine once told the story, after Leona Helmsley's
only son died, she sued his poor widow to get a ring returned.
   Reportedly, the billionaire hotel queen also would secretly drop
bread crumbs on the dining room floor of her mansion to test the
efficiency of the cleaning staff. And she would fire other workers
with little provocation or sympathy.
   Most notoriously of all, she once told an employee: ``We don't
pay taxes. Only little people pay taxes.''
   It's easy to see why the self-anointed hotel queen of New York
has developed into such a despised person across the United States.
   Last week in New York, she finally got what she deserved. U.S.
District Judge John Walker sentenced Helmsley to four years in
prison and to 750 hours of communited their blood ties, yet spontaneously
saw something else in
him, calling him ``Lamb of God'' who atones for human wrongs.
   Although protesting his unworthiness for it, John baptized
Jesus, who insisted on it.
   As he emerged dripping from the water, a heavenly glow ``like a
dove'' descended on him, the account says, and a voice sounded,
``This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.''
   Eventually, as Jesus' ministry began, agents of Galilee's King
Herod Antipas seized John the Baptist, imprisoned him in a dungeon,
and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the king's dancing
step-daughter.
   Gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from John's
attacks on Herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage, but
ancient Jewish historian Josephus says John also was suspected of
inciting insurrection.
   While in prison, John had begun to wonder about Jesus' ministry
and sent followers to ask, ``Are you he who is to come or shall we
look for another?''
   Jesus responded, ``Go and tell John what you hear and see; the
blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed
and the deaf hear ... and the poor have good news preached to them.
And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.''
   This hinted at possible rivalry between them, but Jesus went on
to extol the baptizer.
   While Christianity generally has minimized John as simply a
forerunner of Jesus, the record shows lingering ties between them.
John's influence lasted long afterward in many places as related by
the missionary-apostle Paul.
   Jesus, in his preaching, often referred to John, asking
challenging questions about him to stump critics. Some
contemporaries saw Jesus as John's successor, thinking Jesus was
the baptizer raised from the dead.
   Indicating the bracketing of their work, Jesus' apostles once
asked, ``Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.''
   Jesus then recited _ under pressure of John's example _ that
famous prayer known to all Christianity as the ``Lord's prayer.''
   Yet there was a poignant note as John watched his own star
fading and that of Jesus brightening. ``He must increase, but I
must decrease,'' John told his followers. Yet ``this joy of mine in
now full.''
   Grasping the ``historical solidarity between John and Jesus,''
writes New Testament scholar W.R. Farmer, ``has become an essential
first step toward an understanding of the mission and message of
Jesus.''
   The baptizer, says the fourth gospel, ``was not the light, but
came to bear witness to the light.''

   Two hot-air balloons bearing peace slogans
were anchored Wednesday in front of the Brandenburg Gate as a sign
of friendship.
   Dozens of people looked on as a joint French-West German team
began anchoring the mammoth, brightly colored balloons.
   The team had expected officials would turn down their request to
anchor the balloons on East Berlin territory, but the Foreign
Ministry granted permission, the official ADN news agency said.
   ``We have the luck to experience this new epoch of peace and
understanding,'' said Jean-Marc Culas, the head of the team. ``We
simply wanted to be there and bring our message with the balloons
to everyone.''
   It was yet another sign of relaxed rules along the once-dreaded
Berlin Wall, where dozens of souvenir-seekers continue hack away on
the western side gathering souvenirs.
   West Berlin police said they had taken into custody two
Americans and a West Berlin man who had broken out seven sections
of the wall, each measuring 8 feet high by more than 3 feet wide.
   The unidentified men apparently wanted to sell the sections as
souvenirs and had loaded five of them onto a truck before they were
caught, police said. Police said they were cited for theft and
released.

<UNK>650,000 Strike in Belgrade to Protest Austerity Measures</UNK>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 650,000 workers staged a brief
warning strike Wednesday after the Serbian republic rejected a
package of reforms proposed by the country's reformist government
headed by Premier Ante Markovic.
   Laborers in Belgrade, which is both the national and the Serbian
capital, stopped working for half an hour to protest the
government's austerity measures, the state Tanjug news agency said.
   Drivers, store assistants and others gathered at their
workplaces to read a demand by Belgrade trade unions for easing new
austerity measures.
   The unions said the strike was designed to warn the federal
government to pay more attention to ``impoverished people,'' who
may find their low standards of living dip even lower with the
proposed reforms.
   Markovic's program calls for a six-month wage freeze and
creation of a convertible dinar, along with other unprecedented
sweeping economic and political reforms designed to pull Yugoslavia
out of its economic slump.
   The program, which requires approval by the legislature at its
current session slated to end later Wednesday, also calls for an
end to state subsidies to money-losing companies which may result
in laying off of at least 150,000 workers, according to official
government sources.
   Serbia's officially controlled media unanimously condemned the
proposed reforms.
   Filip Grujic, Serbia's vice premier, told the Serbian parliament
Tuesday the program will ``drastically imperil the position of the
most impoverished people in the entire country.''
   All five other constituent republics, however, gave green light
to Markovic's proposed reforms and plans for political pluralism in
the country.
   Serbia is calling for short-term measures to curb inflation,
such as price freezes. Such price freezes have previously succeeded
in holding down consumer costs, but when the restrictions were
lifted, inflation soared to record levels.
   A prolonged dispute between the leaderships of Yugoslavia's
constituent republics over the country's political and economic
future came to a head in November when the conservative Serbian
government broke off all business and political ties with liberal
Slovenia.

   A naked man tried to force his way
into the U.S. ambassador's residence and was shot and wounded in a
struggle with an armed guard, the U.S. Embassy said Wednesday.
   The incident Tuesday apparently was not politically motivated
and the intruder may have been under the influence of drugs, the
U.S. Embassy said.
   The man, identified by police as a Frenchman born in Senegal,
climbed the fence at the ambassador's house after he was told he
could not enter, and a struggle with a security officer ensued, the
embassy said.
   The intruder tried to grab the guard's gun, and was shot in the
leg, the embassy said. The man was handed over to police, where he
remained in custody.
   Police said the incident began when the man got into an argument
with a West German companion, stripped off his clothes and ran
through the streets.
   He tried unsuccessfully to rob an elderly woman, and then
climbed the embassy fence, police said.
   Vernon A. Walters, the U.S. ambassador, was not home at the
time, the embassy said.

<TEXT>
   Two American news producers were seized from a
hotel in Panama today, prompting the major U.S. networks to ask the
Pentagon and White House for more protection for Americans and
journalists, an ABC spokeswoman said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams confirmed that some Americans
were seized at the Marriott Hotel in Panama City and taken away as
hostages. ``We will make efforts to take care of that,'' he said.
   The networks' request came after CBS' Jon Meyersohn and ABC's
Robert Campos were seized by rifle-carrying men said to be
followers of Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   The two producers had been in the hotel lobby, discussing
satellite transmission to New York of video of the U.S. attack, and
were about to leave when four or five heavily armed men pulled up
in a truck and took them hostage, ABC spokeswoman Elise Adde said.
   It isn't known where they were taken, Adde and a CBS spokesman
said.
   About 100 journalists who have been trying to cover the fighting
in Panama are at the Marriott but are unable to leave because of
gun-carrying Noriega loyalists roaming the streets outside, ABC
correspondent John Quinones reported by phone from the hotel during
a newscast today.
   Meyersohn, 33, is based in New York and is a producer for the
``CBS Evening News.'' Campos, 31, is based in Miami and works for
various ABC News broadcasts. The two are U.S. citizens.
   Williams declined to say whether American troops were moving on
the hotel, citing the U.S. practice of not detailing military
movements.
   Asked why U.S. troops had not taken steps earlier to protect
Americans at the Marriott, Williams said, ``There are 23,000
Americans down there. There are a lot of other places there, too.''
   He said he had no information on the number of Americans that
had been taken hostage from the hotel.

<HEAD>Eds: Toyoda is correct for president's name.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. expects its 1990 domestic sales
to grow 8 percent from this year while exports remain stable,
President Shoichiro Toyoda was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Surging domestic demand will boost domestic sales for a seventh
consecutive year, to a record 2.48 million vehicles next year
compared with this year's estimated sales of 2.30 million, Kyodo
News Service quoted Toyoda as saying.
   The predictions of Japan's largest automaker come in the face of
recent loss of market share due to the brisk performance of Nissan
Motor Co., Japan's No. 2 automaker, which has been cutting into
Toyota's dominance in the domestic market, Kyodo noted.
   While Toyota's 8 percent domestic sales growth outpaces Nissan's
estimate of 4 percent growth in domestic sales to 1.37 million
vehicles next year, Nissan officials announced Tuesday they expect
overseas production to grow a hefty 7 percent in 1990 to 683,000.
   Toyota's exports are expected to remain flat at 1.68 million
units next year, Toyoda said.
   Toyota, which accounts for 41.8 percent of total domestic sales,
plans to boost its share to around 42.8 percent, he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Department of Defense activated a news
media pool that arrived in Panama today alongside U.S. troops
dispatched by President Bush. The pool was developed after the
controversy over secrecy surrounding the 1982 American military
operation in Grenada.
   ``The purpose of the pool is to be there at the beginning of the
operation,'' said a Pentagon official, who spoke on condition that
he not be further identified. He said Pentagon pools are usually
disbanded after the first several days as other reporters arrive on
the scene.
   Notifying and assembling the pool takes place under terms of
secrecy that are unusual for the press. The Pentagon requires that
pool members not tell others about their assignment.
   ``We ask them to tell their families that they have been called
to work. That is not that unusual late at night for journalists. We
ask them not to have their spouses drive them to Andrews Air Force
Base, but to drive themselves or find some other way of getting
there,'' said the Pentagon source.
   The Pentagon pool in Panama is made up of journalists from the
following news organizations: The Associated Press; United Press
International; Reuters; Time Magazine; ABC Radio; NBC Television;
Houston Chronicle; Houston Post, and Dallas Morning News.
   The initial writer's report was received at midmorning
Wednesday, but news organizations were still waiting for
photography from the pool well after noon.
   News executives receive short notice when a pool is being
activated and assign the staff members who provide coverage. Their
material is made available to other media organizations that do not
take part. Participation in the pool is rotated several times a
year.
   News executives notified that the pool has been activated are
also sworn to secrecy.
   The first pool was formed in April 1985, and they have been
assembled on average of twice a year since then, officials said.
   One pool accompanied U.S. Navy warships escorting oil tankers
through the Persian Gulf in July 1987, but most times reporters
receiving the midnight summons have watched military maneuvers.
   The most recent previous pool also went to Panama, in May 1989,
a 12-member group that accompanied the first extra detachment of
Marines sent there in Operation Nimrod Dancer. That pool was not
kept secret, because President Bush announced the operation earlier
in the day.

   Thee more people were killed
in factional fighting in Natal Province, police said Wednesday, and
a Parliament member said Natal's biggest hospital for blacks should
be declared a disaster area.
   Carole Charlewood, who represents a Natal district for the
anti-apartheid Democratic Party, said in a letter to the Health
Ministry that the escalation of violence around the port city of
Durban has aggravated already critical problems at King Edward VIII
Hospital.
   She said the hospital staff is treating 20 to 30 gunshot victims
a day, and patients were exposed to ``squalor, overcrowding and
humiliation.''
   ``The pressures on (operating) theaters and staff means that
other patients requiring surgery must be bypassed, which has
resulted in many unnecessary deaths,'' Mrs. Charlewood wrote.
``Patients also are dying because the intensive care unit
facilities are hopelessly inadequate.''
   The Health Ministry said Health Minister Rina Venter was aware
of the problems at King Edward and giving them appropriate
attention.
   Scores of blacks have been killed in and around the Durban-area
township of Inanda this month, one of the worst surges of violence
during a three-year power struggle in Natal between members of the
relatively conservative Zulu organization Inkatha and supporters of
militant anti-apartheid groups. About 2,500 people have been killed
in the feud.
   The police unrest report Wednesday gave few details about the
latest killings, saying one man was shot to death in the
Durban-area township of Molweni and two killed in their home by
attackers near the town of Richmond.
   On Tuesday, Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok toured
battle-scarred sections of Inanda. He was accompanied by Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, leader of Inkatha and chief minister of the
semi-autonomous black homeland of KwaZulu.
   Vlok told reporters that poverty, high unemployment and
``appalling'' living conditions were a major factor behind the
Inanda violence. But he said peace was unlikely unless ``there is a
change of heart, away from hating one another.''
   Buthelezi says he is as firmly opposed to apartheid as more
militant groups aligned to the outlawed African National Congress.
But he opposes the ANC's use of violence and its advocacy of
confrontational tactics such as strikes, sanctions and
demonstrations.

   `Tis the season for human folly, or, as the sign in the New York
City bus depot puts it: ``The holidays are here. PLEASE! Watch your
belongings.''
   With that in mind, we present our nominations for the 1989
Ebenezer Scrooge Awards, given just this once to those who best
exemplify the seamy underside of the Christmas spirit.
   These are nominations only; there will be no winners. As will
become appallingly obvious, everybody loses.
   For Worst Performance by a Santa, the nominees are:
   _ The Santa in sunglasses who held up a branch of Fidelity Bank
in West Chester, Pa., while softly singing, ``We wish you a merry
Christmas, we wish you a merry Christmas.'' Santa, whose
performance was captured by the bank's surveillance camera,
pocketed $1,000.
   _ The macho Santa who beat up a heckler in front of a crowd of
children in Salvador, Brazil. The heckler reportedly had shouted,
``How about giving me your mother as a present this Christmas,
Santa?'' Santa was arrested after attacking him, but proudly told
police, ``I gave that bum what he deserved.''
   _ The elderly Santa in Lowell, Ark., who made off with cash from
a convenience store after threatening to pour hot coffee on the
clerk.
   For Worst Treatment of a Santa, the nominees are:
   _ Either the employees, the custmers, or both, at the Capital
Plaza Mall, in suburban Landover, Md. A black Santa at the mall
quit after complaining of harassment by co-workers who thought
Santa had to be white. The mall management blamed customers, black
and white, who ``expressed concerns with having a black Santa
Claus.'' The mall later issued a public apology and asked Santa to
come back.
   _ The Marshalltown Mall in Marshalltown, Iowa, which fired a
female Santa because she was _ you guessed it _ female. ``Parents
tell children that Santa Claus is a man, and the mall tries to get
as close to that image as possible,'' mall manager Scott Ball
explained. The mall told Ms. Claus, 28-year-old Tammy Medberry,
that she could go to work as an elf.
   _ The boy from New Zealand whose letter to Santa contained a
bomb threat. Either Santa brings a computer, the child wrote, or
the chimney goes kaboom.
   For the Best or Worst Performance by a Grinch, Depending on How
You Look at It, the nominees are:
   _ Whoever took the nativity scene from Ann Webb's front yard in
Pinetops, N.C. The only thing left was the North Star, still
hanging from a pine tree. ``When I saw what happened,'' Ms. Webb
remarked later, ``I said, `I hope Santa Claus doesn't come to see
them.''' She apparently hadn't heard about the Santa from Brazil.
   _ The burglar who stole more than $1,000 worth of toys from the
Salvation Army in Lufkin, Texas.
   _ The man, described as a ``wino,'' who chopped down the
Hernandez family's live Christmas tree in front of their house in
Inglewood, Calif., and sold it to an unsuspecting neighbor for $7.
``It's awful,'' said another neighbor, Luis Frias. ``Especially at
this time of year, and to steal that kind of thing. Everybody
around here is real depressed.''
   The envelope? Burn it, please.

<TEXT>
   People who climb Mount Everest and other lofty
peaks may suffer oxygen deprivation that damages their brains and
results in temporary memory trouble, according to a study.
   The research on 35 mountaineers found mild impairments of
long-term memory as well as difficulty spelling and following
simple commands. While the problems showed up on psychological
tests, most were too modest to hinder the climbers' daily lives.
   While the research suggests the impairment eventually eases, the
researchers were unsure whether it always goes away.
   ``When you go to extremely high altititudes, you are getting
close to the threshhold of oxygen lack that can cause an impairment
of brain function,'' said Dr. Thomas F. Hornbein. ``It looks like
most of it is transient in most people, but some are more
susceptible than others.''
   Hornbein, an anesthesiologist at the University of Washington,
outlined the results in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was based on tests administered to 34 men and one
woman before and after trips to Mount Everest or Tirich Mir from
1981 to 1984.
   Reports of memory loss and other apparent brain damage among
mountaineers first surfaced following British journeys to Mount
Everest in the 1920s and 1930s.
   ``There is a lot of individual variability,'' said Hornbein.
``One would expect that repeated exposure will produce greater and
longer-lasting impairment. But there are probably people who can go
high and not have any problem whatsoever.''
   He noted that the brain has tremendous capacity to recover from
injury and is probably able to compensate for most of the death of
brain cells that apparently results from temporary oxygen
deprivation.
   Hornbein, who climbed Mount Everest in 1963, said the
possibility of temporary brain damage should be kept in
perspective, considering all the hazards of mountaineering.
   ``Most climbers would consider this a pretty trivial risk in
comparison with all the others,'' he said.

   Members of Congress in both parties today
supported President Bush's assault against Panama's Manuel Antonio
Noriega, although one Democrat said Bush should have consulted with
allies in advance and another called him ``trigger-happy.''
   ``I support the president's decision,'' Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, said in a brief statement from Mexico
City, where he was meeting with government officials. ``It was made
necessary by the reckless actions of Gen. Noriega.''
   ``I hope that the restoration of democracy to Panama will occur
as soon as possible,'' Mitchell said. ``I deeply regret the loss of
life which resulted.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., also offered his
support. ``I think under the circumstances, the decision is
justified,'' he said. Bush asked him for his support in a telephone
call at about 10 p.m. Tuesday.
   ``When there is the engagement of U.S. forces in the field, it
behooves all of us to giver that support,'' Foley told reporters.
   ``My immediate reaction is: at last,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ``After the
failed coup of October, the administration faced two choices _ stow
its anti-Noriega rhetoric and leave itself to the whims of events,
or take the initiative and intervene. The latter was the better
choice.''
   And Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he hoped the rest of the world would take note of
``the unique circumstances'' that faced Bush. ``It is unfortunate
that the United States has been required to take these steps in
Panama'' when it is asking for restraint on the part of the Soviet
Union and China, he said.
   ``I called to tell the president, `my compliments to the
chef','' said Sen. Jesse Helms of North Carolina, the ranking
Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee.
   ``The majority of the Senate will feel good by this turn of
events,'' Helms predicted in a phone call he placed to The
Associated Press.
   However, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said Bush should not have sent U.S.
soldiers into action in Panama without the support and aid of other
Central American nations.
   ``Personally, unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct
threat against the Panama Canal or against American people or
installations, I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such
go-it-alone action,'' said Pell.
   But Pell said he would support the administration until the
attack aimed at unseating Noriega was completed, and he hoped for
``as few deaths as possible to soldiers.''
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., issued a harshly critical statement,
calling Bush's action ``a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy
that continues our mindless 100-year abuse of small Central
American nations.''
   Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution, said Bush had violated the provision which requires
Congress' consent to go to war. ``There was no danger to our
national security from this weak, small country, nor was the Panama
Canal in real peril,'' he said.
   And Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., interviewed on Cable News Network,
said, ``It seems to me that what the president is doing is trying
to correct for his failure to back up the insurgent forces in the
Panamanian Defense Forces back in October. And I think he was wrong
on both occasions. He didn't provide sufficient support last time
and he's doing overkill this time.''
   Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, a senior Republican on the
Foreign Relations Committee, called the action ``an overwhelming
success because democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in
Panama.''
   ``The canal is safe, Americans are safe,'' Lugar said, adding
that the operation was ``a very important moment in the presidency
of George Bush. It is a time when the president asserted his own
leadership and did so effectively.''
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, endorsed Bush's decision and praised the action as a
``blow against the international drug trade.''
   ``We need to see how it plays out,'' said Senate Republican
Leader Robert Dole in a telephone interview with the AP. ``I would
guess there would be widespread bipartisan support for the
president.''
   Bush ordered the U.S. troops to Panama City to apprehend Noriega
and bring him to the United States to stand trial on drug-smuggling
charges, said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. The move also
was intended to protect American lives as well as the Panama Canal,
he said.
   ``I think the president has done the right thing and I suspect
he'll have pretty widespread support in Congress,'' Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., said in an interview with Seattle-based KIRO-TV.
   White House officials said top congressional leaders had been
briefed on the mission to seize Noriega by force.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, also was briefed
about the operation. He said on ``CBS This Morning'' that members
of Congress he had talked to ``are standing by President Bush on
this decision.''
   Gorton called Noriega and his followers ``simply lawless bandits
who broke up a free election and are ruling as nothing more or less
than a drug cartel, and have constantly escalated their
provocations against Americans and the security of the (Panama)
Canal.''
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., called Noriega ``a murderous thug''
who should be brought to trial in the United States for
drug-smuggling. Noriega has been indicted on narcotics smuggling
charges by grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla.
   ``President Bush was requested to intervene with armed force by
the duly elected president of Panama, President (Guillermo) Endara,
whose administration was denied from taking office by Noriega's
thugs after being elected,'' Wilson said in a statement his office
delivered to the AP's Los Angeles bureau.
   Dole said he met with Endara and other elected Panamanian
officials Dec. 10 and ``they were in effect pleading with us to do
something'' about Noriega.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., interviewed on WBBM-AM radio in
Chicago, said, ``I'm satisfied and gratified that the operation is
under way.'' After the earlier failed coup attempt in Panama, he
said, ``We looked impotent; we looked like Lilliputians.''

<HEAD>Study Calls For Greater Teaching of Non-European Languages</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Although Japanese is the most rapidly growing
foreign language course on American college campuses, a major
national program is needed to offer non-European languages to more
students, said a study released Wednesday.
   The study, conducted by Johns Hopkins University foreign
language specialist Richard D. Lambert for the American Council on
Education, said traditional West European languages are still the
heavy favorites among university students.
   The study showed 20.4 percent of college students were studying
Spanish, 16.8 percent French and 7.1 percent German in 1986 at 13
institutions surveyed. Italian was the choice of 2.4 percent and
Russian the choice of 1.8 percent of university students surveyed.
   Japanese was picked by 2.2 percent of the students at 11
universities that offered it but ``has tripled in the last three or
four years,'' Lambert told a news conference.
   ``I was surprised by the spread of the less commonly studied
languages, particularly Japanese, Chinese, Russian and a little bit
of Arabic,'' he said.
   Mandarin Chinese was being studied by 2.1 percent of students at
10 universities. Arabic was the choice of one-half of one percent
of the students at five universities offering it.
   ``While you still get the bulk of students coming in and
continuing in French, German and Spanish, you are getting some
diffusion in the colleges, and in high schools,'' he said. ``Maybe
300 high schools teach Japanese and more teach Russian and
Chinese.''
   One of the problems, Lambert said, is that students ``take
language in the 9th and 10th grades and then it goes fallow in the
11th and 12th grades and is not built upon at the college level.''
   ``You have got a lot of students getting a little bit of
language,'' he said.
   ``What is clearly needed for collegiate level foreign language
teaching is a major national effort dedicated to introducing major
change and upgrading the system.''
   Federal funds for foreign language instruction, he said, go
almost exclusively for programs to teach Defense Department
personnel and other government employes.
   ``It is high time the nation invested the necessary private and
public resources needed to advance foreign language instruction at
the collegiate level,'' Lambert wrote in the study.
   The American Council on Education is a cluster of educational
organizations and institutions. The study was funded by grants from
the Ford Foundation, the Exxon Educational Foundation and the Pew
Charitable Trusts.

   Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu
today blamed ``fascist, reactionary groups'' for anti-government
protests in his country and confirmed that the army had to
intervene to restore order.
   In a 25-minute address on national radio and television hours
after he returned from a three-day visit to Iran, Ceausescu made no
mention of casualties in the west Romanian city of Timisoara.
   Witnesses coming out of Romania have suggested that hundreds of
people were killed when security forces opened fire on
anti-government protesters on Sunday. Reports today suggested the
unrest had spread to other cities.
   Ceausescu said the army had to restore order in Timisoara after
unrest was provoked by ``fascist, reactionary groups who wanted to
destroy the independence and to stop the construction of socialism
in Romania.''
   The address, monitored by The Associated Press in Vienna, did
not say what steps would be taken to prevent continuing unrest.
   Troops and police were reported patrolling Bucharest and other
Romanian cities today in an apparent attempt by the hard-line
Communist authorities to stamp out any further protest.
   About 50,000 demonstrators took to the streets today in
Timisoara, 30 miles from the Yugoslav and Hungarian borders, the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said in a report from Bucharest quoting
the Yugoslav Consul in Timisoara.
   Demonstrators reportedly passed the Yugoslav Consulate, chanting
slogans against Ceausescu. The group passed Romanian army tanks,
but soldiers watched without intervening, the Tanjug report said.
   Ceausescu did not mention that reported protest, or unrest said
by Romanian emigres and other sources to have spread to other
cities in the Balkan nation.
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu, who has been in power 24 years and is
the longest-serving Soviet-bloc leader, refuses to adopt democratic
reforms sweeping the East bloc.
   He has forced hardships and rationing on his 23 million
citizens, who have become increasingly dissatisfied with his harsh
rule as the once-rigid nations around them adopt reforms.
   Tanjug quoted unofficial sources in Bucharest as saying that ``a
state of full alert has been introduced across Romania as protests
and unrest continue in Timisoara and other towns.''
   Witnesses have reported hundreds died during the recent unrest,
but an Austrian traveler, Helmut Wolf, who returned from Timisoara
today said the death toll in anti-government demonstrations was
``more than 1,000.''
   ``Sunday was brutal'' as security personnel fired into crowds of
civilians in the city, Wolf said. Downtown Timisoara, a city of
350,000, is in ruins, he told Austrian radio.
   Late Tuesday, Tanjug quoted unidentified witnesses as saying up
to 2,000 people may have been killed when security forces shot into
the crowd protesting the rigid policies of Ceausescu's Communist
government.
   Mihai Munteanu, a member of the Soviet Parliament from the
Soviet republic of Moldavia, said he spoke with acquaintances in
Romania today and was told pro-democracy demonstrations were going
on in many cities.
   In Iasi, people were burning books by Ceausescu, Munteanu said.
Iasi is an industrial and university center 250 miles northeast of
Bucharest, the capital. It is near the border with Moldavia.
   There also have been unconfirmed reports of clashes in the
cities of Arad, Brasov, Ploiesti, and Bucharest.
   Timisoara was inaccessible to foreign travelers and telephone
callers today, according to Hungarians who tried to telephone and
Yugoslav border guards.
   Tanjug said from Bucharest that foreign reporters who tried to
reach the town were turned back.
   Wolf, who returned to Vienna today after overseeing relief
shipments from Timisoara, told Austrian radio that houses in the
city center were on fire.
   ``Tanks were everywhere,'' Wolf said in the interview.
   A Yugoslav trucker who speaks Romanian said he saw graffiti on
walls while driving in a Timisoara suburb that called for ``an
uprising by Romanians against the Ceausescu regime on Dec. 24.''
   The trucker, who demanded anonymity, said he heard gunfire and
saw the sky being lit from the direction of Timisoara as he drove
near the city today.
   A Hungarian radio reporter meeting people arriving from
Bucharest today said the Romanian army has been mobilized and that
on Tuesday night reservists were called in.
   In Bucharest, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy told The
Associated Press that ``there is an increasing police and military
presence in the streets of Bucharest. The streets are calm and
quiet.''
   A Hungarian who called Bucharest and four other major Romanian
cities from Budapest today said he was told of a heavy military and
police presence in the streets.
   Guards at factories and offices have been doubled, according to
his informants and a brief report from Bucharest by the Soviet news
agency Tass.
   The Hungarian reported that in Brasov, Romania's second-largest
city, helicopters were patrolling overhead in addition to the
increased security in the streets. Brasov was the scene of
Romania's last major anti-government demonstration, in November
19to
discuss the operation and give his legal advice, Runkel said.
   Runkel cited the ``inherent right of self-defense'' in Article
51 of the United Nations Charter and the right of the U.S.
government to protect its citizens, military installations and
institutions under Article 21 of the Organization of American
States treaty.
   The Panama Canal Treaty also empowers the United States ``to
protect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations,''
Runkel said.
   The spokesman said that ``the democratically elected government
of Panama was consulted prior to and welcomed the action taken by
the United States.''

<HEAD>Two Involved With PTL Released on $25,000 Bond</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The evangelist who introduced PTL founder
Jim Bakker to Jessica Hahn, leading to the scandal that destroyed
the television ministry, was released on $25,000 bond Wednesday on
federal perjury charges.
   In his first court appearance on the charges, John Wesley
Fletcher appeared without a lawyer before U.S. Magistrate Paul
Taylor, who imposed several conditions for his release, including
surrendering his passport and refraining from the use of alcohol.
Fletcher recently was arrested in Durham on a charge of driving
while intoxicated.
   According to the Dec. 5 indictment, on Sept. 24, 1987, Fletcher
denied during testimony before the grand jury that indicted Bakker
and three associates that he took Ms. Hahn to a Florida hotel to
have sex with Bakker. At a later appearance, Fletcher told the same
grand jury that he agreed when Bakker told him: ``Get me a woman.''
   In a separate hearing, the Rev. Sam Johnson, a former PTL
minister, was released on the same unsecured bond. Johnson is
accused of lying to the special grand jury about a $10,000 loan he
made to former PTL executive Richard Dortch that later went to Ms.
Hahn.
   The payment to Ms. Hahn was made Nov. 1, 1984, before the former
church secretary received $265,000 in PTL money in exchange for her
silence about her 1980 sexual liaison with Bakker. Disclosure of
the payment eventually brought down the PTL evanglism empire built
by Bakker, who is now in federal prison after being convicted in
October of fraud and conspiracy charges.
   ``I feel very confident,'' Johnson said as he left the
courthouse. ``This has been a very unfortunate experience.''
   Asked if he would plead innocent, he responded: ``Absolutely.''
   Taylor agreed to appoint counsel for Fletcher after the
evangelist told the magistrate: ``I have nothing, sir, except the
clothes on my back.'' Taylor said later that Fletcher, who filed
for bankruptcy court protection in 1987, had signed an affidavit
saying he could not afford an attorney.
   Johnson faces five years in prison and a $250,000 fine for each
of 12 perjury counts. Fletcher could face the same sentence on one
perjury count.
   No arraignment was scheduled for Fletcher. Taylor scheduled a
Jan. 16 arraignment for Johnson.

<HEAD>China Buys More U.S. Wheat</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought additional U.S. wheat under a
price subsidy program, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   F. Paul Dickerson, general sales manager for the department's
Foreign Agricultural Service, said seven private exporting
companies made the deals for a total of 410,000 metric tons under
the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for February and March, he
said.
   The sales were part of 1 million tons authorized China under EEP
on Dec. 5. A previous allocation of 2 million tons made Feb. 27 had
been exhausted, except for 10,000 tons.
   With the latest EEP approvals, China has 600,000 tons remaining
to be used under the current authorization.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 15 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at $3.85 per bushel, the wheat
would have a farm value of about $58 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters may sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Dickerson said the latest subsidies averaged $19.26 per ton, or
about 52 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Cargill Inc., 125,000 tons;
Continental Grain Co., 80,000; Coprostates Inc., 50,000; Louis
Dreyfus Corp., 40,000; Peavy Co., 40,000; Tradigrain Inc., 40,000;
and Mitsubishi International Corp., 35,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 5.1 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1989-90 marketing year that began
June 1, most of it without subsidies. In 1988-89, China bought more
than 8 million tons of U.S. wheat, all of it under the EEP program.

   Nicaragua condemned the U.S. attack on
Panama today and placed its army on alert, while Peru ordered its
ambassador in Washington to return to Lima until all American
troops are withdrawn.
   Other Latin American nations expressed concern over the U.S.
intervention, and seven of them, including Peru, agreed to hold an
emergency meeting in Bogota to discuss the crisis.
   Nicaragua called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to
discuss the attack, and the world body was considering that request
today.
   Foreign ministers of Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Peru,
Venezuela and Colombia planned to meet in Bogota tonight to discuss
the developments in Panama and issue a declaration, the Colombian
Foreign Ministry announced.
   Panama was part of the so-called Latin American Group of Eight
but was excluded after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega ousted
Panamanian president Eric Delvalle in February 1988. The group
usually represents Latin America's stands on economic and political
matters.
   Presidents of the seven countries were in telephone consultation
over the situation in Panama and decided to hold the meeting in
Bogota, a Colombian spokesman said.
   The group has condemned Noriega's regime, but it has also
consistently rejected any direct U.S. intervention in Panama.
   President Alan Garcia of Peru condemned the U.S. military action
and said he was ordering Peru's ambassador in Washington to return
home pending a withdrawal of all American troops from Panamanian
territory.
   Garcia, reading a prepared statement at the Government Palace in
Lima, also said the drug summit Feb. 15 with President Bush and the
presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru should be postponed as a
result of events in Panama.
   Venezuela, which has long opposed Noriega, condemned the U.S.
attack but recognized that the action was necessary.
   In a communique issued in Caracas, Venezuela blamed a ``lack of
an effective and firm response by our countries to the violation of
human rights and constitutional norms on the part of the de facto
government of Panama'' for the U.S. intervention.
   But Venezuela also called for U.S. troops to retire before it
would recognize the new government of Guillermo Endara, who was
elected president of Panama in May in a vote that was not
recognized by Noriega forces.
   Venezuela spearheaded attempts in the Organization of American
States to issue strong condemnations of the Noriega regime in an
effort to pressure him into leaving power.
   But Latin American nations showed strong revulsion to what they
saw as intervention in the internal affairs of a member country.
   While condemning the Noriega dictatorship's abuses, Venezuela
added that it lamented that ``traditional principles of
non-intervention ... have given way to this intervention that today
must be condemned and rejected.''
   Venezuela called for the immediate meeting of an OAS consulting
committee to ``analyze and take decisions that will contribute to
the re-establishment of Panamanian sovereignty.''
   In Buenos Aires, Argentine Foreign Minister Domingo Cavallo
expressed concern today and said the Group of Eight countries will
seek a way of ``acting together'' to end the conflict.
   Cavallo told reporters that President Bush spoke by telephone
with President Carlos Menem early today ``to explain the North
American position.'' ``There is a situation of heavy confrontation
between North American and Panamanian troops as well as armed
civilians who are acting in coordination with the Panama Defense
Forces,'' Cavallo said.
   Latin America, he said, ``is going to have to play a fundamental
role to prevent a deepening of the crisis and a greater spilling of
blood.''
   In Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel Orgega declared a
``state of national alert'' and sent messages to the Security
Council, Non-Aligned Movement and Pope John Paul II saying he was
``deeply concerned by the invasion of Panama.''
   ``In addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Panama, it is a threat to
the peace and security of all Latin America, Central America and
especially constitutes a serious threat to Nicaragua,'' Ortega said
in a communique read on Voice of Nicaragua radio.
   The army was put on a ``state of combative general alert.'' The
communique said that implied immediate deployment of land, sea and
air combat units. Reserves and civilian militia also were called up.
   The United States supports the rebels seeking to oust the
leftist Sandinista government.

   Pope John Paul II on Wednesday joined the
condemnation of brutal repression of protesters in Romania, and
prominent Britons demanded that hard-line President Nicolae
Ceausescu be stripped of a knighthood that was bestowed on him.
   ``With deep pain we have all heard the news of dead and wounded
in some Romanian cities,'' the pope said.
   His comment on the violence, in which up thousands may have been
killed, came at the end of his regular weekly audience. John Paul
said he was praying that human rights and religious liberty would
prevail in Romania, which is controlled by the last Stalinist
regime in the Soviet bloc.
   Ceausescu, who has ruled Romania for 24 years, was given the
Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath, the highest honor for
a foreign leader, during a state visit in June 1978.
   Lord Bethell, vice-chairman of the European Parliament's human
rights subcommittee, said ``the Order of the Bloodbath would have
been more appropriate.''
   In Geneva, leaders of the World Council of Churches and
affiliated organizations expressed shock at the crackdown and said
it revealed the ``ruthlessness'' of Romania's leadership.
   ``It is with shock and deep sorrow that we have learned of the
tragedy in Timisoara where violent repression by the armed forces
took the lives of many people,'' a statement said. Most of the
violence, which began last weekend, has occurred in Timisoara, a
city in western Romania.
   In Bulgaria, where the Communist leadership was equally rigid
until last month, several thousand people gathered outside the
Romanian Embassy in Sofia, shouting ``Ceausescu is a shame for
Europe!'' ``Fascists!'' and ``Murderers!'' The embassy refused to
accept a protest letter.
   The independent Union of Democratic Forces, which organized the
rally, urged Bulgaria to ``dissolve all treaties'' with the
Romanian regime and recall the Bulgarian ambassador. The two
nations are allies in the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   President Francesco Cossiga of Italy made his feelings clear
during his annual Christmas meeting with diplomats, telling the
Romanian ambassador, Constantin Tudor: ``I was hoping this meeting
would take place in a different atmosphere. We are very saddened
and worried ... about what is happening in Romania.''
   In Brussels, NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner said the 16
nations of the Western alliance expressed ``their dismay at the
serious loss of life.''
   ``The government's use of massive brutal force to suppress these
demonstrations illustrates that the Romanian regime does not rule
with the consent of the people,'' he said.
   At the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in
Europe in Vienna on Wednesday, Romanian representatives were
isolated.
   Delegates condemned the killing, but the Romanians managed to
prevent the observance of a minute of silence.
   Austria, as host, declared to the conference that ``the Romanian
regime of murderers will be unable to stay in power.''
   Martin Vukovich, leader of the Austrian delegation, said all
delegations condemned the events in Romania, but that the Soviet
condemnation was restrained.
   The Soviets urged their Romanian allies to heed the human rights
provisions of the 1975 Helsinki agreements on European security and
cooperation, he said.
   In Yugoslavia, the Communist Party leadership decided to ``stop
concrete cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party for the time
being.''
   A statement from the party presidency held the Romanian party
responsible ``for last weekend's tragic events and their
consequences,'' the official news agency Tanjug reported, and an
invitation to Romania to send a delegation to the Yugoslav party
congress scheduled for January was withdrawn.
   Hungary gave a note to Romanian Ambassador Traian Pop that
condemned ``the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrators.''
Legislators observed a minute of silence for the victims and voted
to drape the parliament building in black.
   Czechoslovakia's parliament condemned the crackdown and said the
government in Prague should ``draw the necessary conclusions'' from
the events. There was no elaboration.
   The Foreign Ministry in Czechoslovakia, where the beating of
protesters started an uprising that ended the Communist Party power
monopoly in less than a month, protesting the use of force on
demonstrators. Czechoslovak air controllers have urged an
international boycott of Romanian plans.
   Eugene Ionesco, the celebrated Romanian-born playwright, said
the Soviet Union should help arrange the downfall of Ceausescu, the
French newspaper Le Figaro reported.
   Ionesco, who lives in Paris, said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
``alone can do something, because Romania is literally colonized by
the Soviet Union,'' the newspaper reported.

   A drug counselor was arrested on charges of
offering an abuser on probation a drug-free jar of urine in
exchange for a Mercedes.
   David Holland, 36, of Maple Shade, N.J., was taken into custody
Tuesday on theft and bribery charges after accepting the keys and
signing the title to a $28,000 Mercedes provided by investigators
tipped off to the alleged offer.
   Holland, who was freed on $5,000 bail, is a counselor at
Consortium, which has a city contract to provide drug-treatment
programs.
   The district attorney's office said Holland told an unidentified
19-year-old on probation for drug possession that he faced a jail
term because of his drug-tainted urine. Holland offered a drug-free
sample, authorities said.
   The man, who was required to undergo treatment at Consortium as
part of his probation, thought the price was too steep and reported
it to his lawyer, who notified the district attorney's office.
   Investigators put the man in a Mercedes that had been forfeited
in drug raids.

   Four anonymous letters mailed in August to
declare war on various federal appeals courts are being examined
for possible links to mail bombings that killed a judge and a civil
rights lawyer, the FBI said today.
   The letters may be an important clue in the FBI's investigation
of the parcel bombs that killed Judge Robert S. Vance, a member of
the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta, and Robert E.
Robinson, a Savannah, Ga., alderman and civil rights lawyer, said
FBI spokesman Greg Jones.
   ``We are examining those letters to try to determine whether or
not there is a link between those threats in August and the matters
at hand today,'' Jones said.
   One letter declaring war on the 11th Circuit was received Aug.
24 by WAPT-TV in Jackson, Miss., the station reported Tuesday night.
   Similar letters were received that month in Minneapolis,
Milwaukee and California that made threatening statements against
other federal appellate circuit courts, Jones said.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement Tuesday
that the investigation is focusing on the possibility that race
motivated the killings and the sending of similar package bombs to
the 11th Circuit and the NAACP in Jacksonville, Fla.
   Vance ruled in favor of the Jacksonville NAACP on Sept. 15 in a
school desegregation case.
   The letter received in Jackson bore an Atlanta postmark dated
Aug. 21, the day before a tear-gas cannister exploded in that
city's NAACP office, injuring eight people. Jones declined to
describe the postmarks on the other letters, except to say they
were sent in late August.
   All four letters were examined by the FBI laboratory in
Washington but yielded no further physical clues, such as
fingerprints, Jones said. U.S. Marshals in the various
jurisdictions were told of the threatening letters, Jones.
   The letter attacking the 11th Circuit threatened poison gas
attacks on large cities to force the court to ``adopt fair and
impartial treatment of all.''
   Entitled ``Declaration of War,'' the letter said the 11th
Circuit ``does deliberately and wrongfully refuse to fulfill its
obligation to protect the innocent.''
   ``The court's failure to render impartial and equitable
judgments is due to rank bias and the mistaken belief its victims
cannot effectively retaliate,'' the letter said.
   The Jackson television station said it immediately turned the
letter over to the FBI.
   Three weeks after the letter surfaced, the 11th Circuit
published Vance's opinion for the unanimous three-judge panel in
the Jacksonville school case. It reversed a lower-court ruling that
Jacksonville schools could stop busing to achieve racial
integration.
   On Saturday, Vance was killed in his Mountain Brook, Ala., home
after opening a parcel mailed to him.
   On Monday, a similar bomb was found at the 11th Circuit
courthouse in Atlanta and removed without incident. Hours later,
Robinson was fatally injured in his Savannah law office when he
opened the parcel mailed to him.
   On Tuesday, authorities found a similar bomb at the office of
the Jacksonville NAACP, which brought the school case.
   FBI Director William Sessions told reporters Tuesday he would
not be surprised if the Vance murder was related to cases he had
worked on as a federal appellate judge.
   Sessions said Vance's court docket would be carefully studied to
determine if his rulings may have sparked a racially motivated
murder.
   Sessions implied that the bureau did not have a suspect, and
indicated there might be more than one perpetrator.
   ``As far as I know there's been no claimant of responsibility at
all,'' Sessions said at a news conference at the Justice Department.
   Sessions said investigators found no similarities between the
bomb incidents and the actions of extremist white groups but ``it
is something you cannot rule out.''
   ``We would hope the patterns of these types of groups when
studied carefully and compared will yield fruit,'' Sessions said.
   Asked about racial motivation, Sessions said: ``When the NAACP
headquarters receives a suspicious package, an alderman is killed,
you have to have that in the back of your mind.''
   The package containing the bomb that killed Vance bore the
return address of another 11th Circuit judge, Lewis F. Morgan, a
government source said in Washington.
   Morgan, who had previously sent packages to Vance, is not a
suspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was familiar with
the two judges' friendship, said the source, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Thornburgh called the incidents ``an affront to our nation's
commitment to the rule of law'' and said he had assured civil
rights leaders the case would be thoroughly investigated.

<TEXT>
   Ten years ago, guerrilla chieftain
Robert Mugabe put pen to paper in London to end a bloody seven-year
war for control of his homeland, Britain's last colonial outpost in
Africa known as Rhodesia.
   That all-party peace pact signed on Dec. 21, 1979, silenced the
guns and led to the birth of black-governed Zimbabwe four months
later.
   A decade later, as president of Zimbabwe, Mugabe is on the
receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels
based in Mozambique.
   While Mugabe was able to lead Rhodesia to peace as Zimbabwe
through talks, he is opposed to similar direct negotiations with
the insurgents, who have threatened to bring their war into
Zimbabwe.
   Alfonso Dhlakama's Mozambique National Resistance seeks to
undermine Mozambique President Joaquim Chissano's socialist
government.
   The 12-year-old war has left an estimated 500,000 to 700,000
dead and created about 1 million Mozambican refugees. Almost half
of Mozambique's 15 million people require some food aid.
   The guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital to
landlocked Zimbabwe's economy, and Mugabe has stationed 12,000
troops in Mozambique at a crippling cost of $450,000 a day.
   Dhlakama's rebels now routinely cross the scrub-studded plains
and pine-carpeted mountains into Zimbabwe to raid tea and coffee
plantations, native villages and state schools.
   Hundreds of Zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in these
forays, and tens of thousands have been herded into state-guarded
villages, upsetting life all along the 800-mile frontier.
   ``The Rhodesians forced many people into so-called protected
villages when they were fighting Mugabe's guerrillas,'' said a
Roman Catholic missionary, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
``So there are villagers today who are suspicious that they're
being placed in similar settlements by the government they
support.''
   But missionaries back the government's contention that
Zimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because of
the rebels.
   The guerrillas, known also by their Portuguese acronym Renamo,
have been accused of widespread atrocities, including the killing
of children, mutilating of victims, rape, and destruction of entire
communities.
   The rebels were founded in 1977 by former Rhodesian Prime
Minister Ian D. Smith to hound Mugabe's guerrillas in their
Mozambican bases.
   Mugabe ended aid for Renamo when he came to power and no
government currently acknowledges assistance.
   Mugabe and Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi have been acting as
intermediaries in indirect talks in Kenya between the rebels and
the Mozambique government. There have been no breakthroughs since
the talks began in July.
   Mugabe has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks for
Mozambique, insisting Renamo disavow violence and lay down its arms
first.
   Renamo, in turn, demands Zimbabwe withdraw its troops from
Mozambique before face-to-face negotiations can be considered.
   Renamo also demands that Mozambique's government allow it to
take part in elections as a legal party.
   The Mozambican government says it will not accept a second party
but is considering a proposal that would allow people who are not
in the ruling party to run for Parliament.

<HEAD>Provisions of Panama Canal Treaty</HEAD>
<HEAD>With Panama Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here is a summary of the two Panama Canal treaties signed in
September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian leader Omar
Torrijos:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CONTROL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Panama will administer the canal jointly
until the expiration of the treaty on Dec. 31, 1999. At that time,
control, management and maintenance of the canal go to the
Panamanian government.
   The U.S. president was to appoint a Panamanian nominated by his
government as administrator to take charge of the canal on Jan. 1,
1990. But the United States refuses to recognize the government of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, and has spurned his choice for the
post.
   President George Bush announced Dec. 5 he asked the canal's
deputy administrator, Panamanian Fernando Manfredo, to take over as
acting administrator. Manfedo accepted.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>DEFENSE</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   For the duration of the treaty the United States has primary
responsibility for the defense of the canal. A board of U.S. and
Panamanian military officers was established to consult on defense
matters and every five years reviews military resources made
available by both countries. During the life of the treaty, the
United States decides on its own how and when to reduce its forces
in the Canal Zone and schedule the closing of its bases.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>COMPENSATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The United States pays Panama $50 million to $60 million from
canal revenue and an additional $10 million a year for the canal's
operation. Panama also received $50 million in military assistance
over a 10-year period.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>LANDS AND WATERS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   About 70 percent of the 500-square-mile Canal Zone reverted to
Panama after the treaty was ratified. The United States retained
temporary control over the rest, including areas considered vital
to running the canal.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>JURISDICTION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Three years after ratification, American civilian employees in
the Canal Zone became subject to Panamanian law instead of American
law. Panama took responsibility for public and social services,
including schools, the Canal Zone police force, and postal service.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>NEUTRALITY</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   Under a separate treaty, the two countries agreed to a guarantee
that the canal would remain open to ships of all nations and that
the canal's neutrality would be respected ``in times of war as in
times of peace.'' American and Panamanian warships and other
vessels were given priority to use the canal.

   Martin Marietta on Wednesday delayed
the maiden commercial launch of its Titan 3 rocket until Dec. 27
because of a forecast calling for several days of unfavorable
weather.
   It was the fifth postponement this month of the launch, which is
to boost into orbit communications satellites for a Japanese
company and the British Ministry of Defense. Three of the scrubs
were caused by too-strong winds about 30,000 feet above the launch
area.
   Liftoff had been rescheduled for Wednesday night, but with rain
falling throughout the day and with a forecast that the stiff upper
level winds would persist for several days, Martin Marietta decided
to put off the effort until after Christmas.
   The company said countdown would start Tuesday, aiming for a
liftoff at 7:24 p.m. Wednesday.

<HEAD>Economy Continues Growth Amid Fears It's Running Out of Steam</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at a faster rate in the
third quarter than previously estimated, the government said
Wednesday, but analysts say it is fast running out of steam and
some suggest it is flirting with a recession.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product, the
broadest measure of economic health, grew at an annual rate of 3
percent in the July-September period, up from a 2.5 percent rate
reported in October and the subsequent revision to 2.7 percent last
month.
   However, analysts said the economic growth in the third quarter
borrowed its strength from the current quarter, when many see a
growth rate of less than 1 percent and possibly an end to the
unprecedented seven years of peacetime expansion.
   The administration is forecasting a 2.7 percent growth rate for
all of 1989, and the fourth-quarter GNP would have to advance 1.6
percent to meet that goal. The GNP grew by 3.7 percent in the first
quarter and 2.5 percent in the second.
   ``The bottom line is that we borrowed from the future to produce
3 percent growth and that source of strength is gone now,'' said
Allen Sinai, chief economist for The Boston Co.
   Sinai and others said much of the third-quarter growth resulted
from robust earlier-than-normal sales of automobiles and light
trucks in the third quarter that were driven by incentives.
   But the incentives were dropped with the introduction of
higher-priced 1990 models in October and sales immediately slumped.
Only this month have automakers begun to restore rebates and lower
interest rates that chief economist David Berson of the Federal
National Mortgage Association said could boost sales early next
year.
   Many analysts had suggested the Federal Reserve would have to
ease credit further to stimulate the economy and the central bank
late Tuesday added money to the banking system in a signal that it
might lower interest rates.
   As a result, the key federal funds rate, the interest banks
charge each other for overnight loans, dropped to 8 7-16 percent
from about 8{ percent late Tuesday. Analysts said they expected a
target of 8\ percent for the rate, the first drop since late
November.
   Samuel D. Kahan, chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson
Government Securities Inc. in Chicago, forecast fourth-quarter
growth of 1 percent with continued weakness in the first quarter of
1990.
   ``I think a lot will depend on monetary policy,'' Kahan said.
``If the Fed continues to drag its heels, it could continue to get
weakness and could turn this into a recession.''
   But even with further easing by the central bank, Kahan said he
expects a ``somewhat lackluster first quarter'' returning to 2
percent to 2.5 percent growth later in the year.
   Sinai, on the other hands, says that while economic data does
not support his view, ``I think we're in some sort of recession''
now.
   The sluggish fourth-quarter growth is a result of Fed efforts to
contain inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit. Inflation
appeared to begin moderating earlier this year and since June the
central bank has eased some short-term interest rates.
   Its policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee, met
secretly Monday and Tuesday, but as usual, gave no indication of
any decisions.
   The GNP report contained favorable inflation news, however. A
price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of 2.9 percent,
unchanged from earlier estimates but down from the 5 percent jump
in the April-June quarter.
   The revision in the latest report was due in large part to new
data that showed exports rose 3.9 percent, rather than 1.6 percent
as reported earlier. At the same time, imports fell from a 9.5
percent gain first reported to 7.4 percent in the latest report.
   Consumer spending, however, dropped to a 5.6 percent increase
rather than the 6.2 percent advance reported last month. Consumer
spending represents two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   Business capital spending posted a 5.2 percent gain, compared
with 4.6 percent in last month's report, possibly reflecting an
improvement in the decline of corporate profits.
   In that report, the Commerce Department said after-tax profits
of U.S. corporations fell 5.4 percent rather than the 7.2 percent
decline reported in November.
   Housing construction, hit by high mortgage interest rates during
much of the year, fell 9.2 percent in the third quarter. It was
reported to be off 8.4 percent a month ago.
   Government purchases were down 2.4 percent, 0.3 percentage point
below the November estimate.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the third quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.16 trillion.

   Officials of the Marriott Corp. said today
they were pressing the U.S. government to ensure the safety of
guests at a luxury hotel in downtown Panama City after several
people were taken from the building by Panamanian troops.
   The 400-room Marriott Hotel, which employs 300 people, was about
42 perce Tuesday when Panamanian military troops
came to the facility, according to Roger Conner, a spokesman for
Betent occupied lathesda, Md.-based Marriott.
   Although Conner said details were sketchy, it was his
understanding that ``Panamanian military forces had come into our
hotel and seized an undetermined amount of people.'' He said a
handful of journalists, as well as several employees, were taken
from the hotel early this morning by Panamanian troops.
   The remainder of the guests were accommodated in the hotel
ballroom, Conner said.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. forces in Panama were
aware of hostages taken from the Marriott Hotel and that some
Americans were still at liberty in the building.
   ``We will make efforts to take care of that,'' said Williams.
But he declined to say whether American troops were moving guests in a
situation that was ``just like when an earthquake hits ... Everyone
makes do.''
   ``Operations are not normal,'' he said, but he did not think the
hotel guests were under guard by Panamanian military officials.
   The hotel's general manager, Sapinder Palta, was at a meeting in
Fort Lauderdale, Fla., today but had been in touch with the hotel
by telephone, Conner said. Other hotel officials, including
Marriott Hotels President Bill Tiesel, were trying to get through
to the hotel, but having little success, Conner said.
   But the hotel officials had been in touch with the U.S.
government. ``From Marriott's standpoint, we are taking every
effort to have the U.S. military troops secure the hotel so that
guests can be protected,'' he said.
   The hotel, the Panama Marriott Caesar Park, is owned by Aoki
Construction Inc., a Japanese company, but it is managed by
Marriott. Opened in 1982, the hotel is adjacent to the Atlapa
Convention Center five minutes from the banking center of Panama
City.
   At the time of the U.S. invasion of Panama, most of the guests
were journalists and airline crews, Conner said. There were few
businessmen in the hotel, he said.

<HEAD>Boys Protest Exploding Rocket Booster Toy as `Sick Humor'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four young brothers, upset by a Sears,
Roebuck and Co. Christmas catalog toy that features an exploding
rocket booster, have taken on the giant retailer and apparently won.
   ``Sabotage the rocket booster'' is how the holiday Wishbook
promotes an exploding toy rocket, part of a series called Building
Blasters.
   Angry over the association with the fatal January 1986 explosion
of the space shuttle Challenger, the Sanders boys fired off letters
in September to Sears executives and President Bush.
   ``We feel this is very sick humor,'' wrote Jared, 13, and Seth,
9. ``We don't want children learning to blow up space shuttles!
There are plenty of terrorists in the world already.''
   Younger brothers Spencer, 5, and Cody, 3, also signed the
letters.
   Rita Guttke, a Sears customer relations official in Chicago,
recently wrote the boys: ``Your concern is valid. I doubt that this
product will be offered in future catalogs.''
   The catalog, distributed over the summer, invited customers to
build a rocket pad and ``detonate'' the accompanying rocket upon
launch.
   ``It's pretty disgusting, from both a parent and a schoolteacher
point of view,'' Barbara Morgan, who was NASA's backup teacher in
space, said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Morgan, of McCall, witnessed the Challenger explosion that
killed all seven astronauts aboard, including New Hampshire teacher
Christa McAuliffe.
   NASA's James Funkhouser, a public services division director in
the Office of Communications, said he wrote a letter of complaint
to Sears a week ago after learning of the Sanders' protest but has
not received a response.
   The boys' mother said Sears' reply to her sons was not enough.
``There's no guarantee the toys are going to be off their
shelves,'' Christa Sanders said Tuesday.
   However, the manufacturer, Kenner Products Inc., said
manufacturing and shipping of the toy have been discontinued due to
poor sales.
   John Bohach, vice president of advertising and marketing
services at Kenner's Cincinnati headquarters, said the company had
no intention of equating the toy with the Challenger. He said the
company found that ``kids like to build things and like to knock
them down.''
   The Building Blasters series includes an oil rig, a fuel depot,
a suspension bridge and a communications tower.
   In her letter to the Sanders boys, Ms. Guttke said the
possibility of encouraging terrorism never surfaced while the toy
was being child-tested.
   Sears spokesman Gordon Jones and Kenner's Bohach both said the
Sanders children's complaint was the only one they had heard.

dead in the streets and touched off a fire that leveled a slum area
around a Panamanian Defense Forces stronghold, witnesses said.
   U.S. troops in helicopters warned townspeople in Panama's
capital of the impending attack, assuring them by loudspeaker that
the soldiers ``didn't have a problem with the government,'' said
one witness.
   The witnesses spoke to reporters in Boston by telephone.
   ``They burned everything down,'' Manuel Backalt said in an
interview from a Salvation Army office near the Defense Forces
headquarters where he fled with his wife and three children. ``I
see plenty people dead in the street.''
   He said the bodies _ he did not know how many _ were mainly
members of the dignity battalions, civilian paramilitary groups
loyal to Noriega.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Rolando Diaz, 32, who also took
refuge in the Salvation Army office, said there were warnings in
the night of the coming attack.
   ``Before they started to bomb, they warned (those in the area of
Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters) to come out,'' he said.
``They were shouting down over the PA system saying ... they didn't
have a problem with the government.''
   At that point residents of the slum area surrounding the
headquarters, a section of mostly wooden homes, headed into the
streets, he said.
   ``They came out when they heard the announcement, and American
soliders led them to a neighborhood church,'' Diaz said. He said
the American soldiers moved in as he was heading to the church.
During the attack a fire began, destroying the area, he said.
   Backalt, a self-employed stove repairman, said he was sleeping
when he heard gunfire. He said his house caught fire, and he and
his family went out into the street. None of his family was injured.
   As they walked the streets, he said, they saw a helicopter
crash. He said he didn't know if it was an American or Panamanian
helicopter.
   Allan Wiltshire, head of the Salvation Army office, said Backalt
was one of about 40 people near the office who were looking for
assistance. He said it would be difficult to care for those
displaced and injured in the attack.
   ``They want a place to stay because they are all burnt out. It's
mounting up,'' he said.
   Wiltshire said pro-Noriega forces were commandeering cars
throughout the morning from people driving during the attack.
   ``They say, `We're the police. We need your car,''' he said.
   His wife, Marjorie, said they saw several families scurrying
about with their possessions.
   ``They were carrying TVs and their belongings on their heads,''
she said. ``We're just about to get some meals cooked so we can
service them.''
   The Salvation Army office is about two miles from Fort Amador,
an American base, and is near the headquarters of the Panama
Defense Forces.
   Wiltshire's daughter, Avonnie, said she was awakened by the
sound of shooting.
   ``I thought it was firecrackers. We realized after that it was a
lot of gunfire,'' she said. ``We tried to stay away from the
windows and doors.''
   The Wiltshires said the Armed Forces radio station broadcast
warnings throughout the early morning, advising people stay indoors.

   Ice-covered roads made the bus ride
after school a harrowing experience, but one man's hospitality made
everything turn out right.
   Six students attending Little Rock schools never reached home
Monday night. Instead, they spent a snug night at the home of their
bus driver.
   ``What else could I have done?'' Carl Wilcox, 58, said Tuesday.
``The bus is family. We're a small group and we're together a lot
during the day, so we're family.''
   ``I'm proud that we have a man who confirmed to the kids that he
would put them up and see to their well-being,'' said David Booth,
an assistant supervisor with the Pulaski County School District's
Transportation Department.
   Wilcox said the slow journey on the bus included a three-hour
traffic jam on highways, waiting in vain for traffic to clear
during an hour-long stay at one student's house, losing traction
between two hills being towed a half-mile backward by Sherwood
firefighters, and narrowly missing a man standing in the road.
   Donna Peterman, 15, said Wilcox told them to keep their seat
belts on and talk to their friends to take their mind off the road.
She and Carl Atkins, 16, said the students sang, played cards and
talked.
   Then the bus got stuck in a ditch. Wilcox and his riders were
taken to the Sherwood Police Department, and the city's fire
department took all seven people to Wilcox's home at about 11 p.m.
in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
   There, Wilcox said, he and his wife Jean fed them hot dogs and
pizzas and put them to bed _ three girls in the couple's own bed
and three boys in beds formerly used by the couple's grown
children. Wilcox said he and his wife slept on a fold-out couch in
their living room.
   ``He's a hero,'' said Atkins. ``He got us out of the mess and
kept everyone calm.''

   Santa Claus weighs too much, probably has high
cholesterol, eats too many cookies on Christmas Eve and should
exercise more than once a year, but health experts are impressed by
his longevity.
   As far as physicians can determine, Saint Nick is about 1,700
years old.
   ``He must be doing something right to have lived this long,''
Kathy Gonzalez, a dietician at Pittsburgh's St. Margaret Memorial
Hospital, said.
   Health experts worry he inhales too much soot scurrying up and
down chimneys and spends too much time in the cold.
   ``He is clearly overweight and probably has a cardiac problem,''
said Eleanor Streiff, chief of disease control for the Allegheny
County Health Department. ``He probably also has pulmonary problems
from going down chimneys and getting all that dirt in his lungs.''
   Also, driving instructors and physicians wonder how a
17-century-old man has managed to keep a license to operate an
airborne vehicle, even one powered by eight tiny reindeer.
   Santa's unhealthy habits go back at least 180 years, when
Washington Irving described him as fat and was puffing a
long-stemmed pipe.
   ``Santa would certainly be at increased risk of cancer of the
lip or mouth,'' Dr. Ronald Heberman, director of the Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute, said.
   The psychological impact of Santa spending months of unending
darkness at the North Pole worries Dr. Trevor Price, chairman of
Allegheny General Hospital's psychiatry department.
   Price suggested Santa's toy-giving spree is his way of coping
with his generally gloomy winter mood.
   But there is good news about Santa's health.
   ``Children are leaving glasses of low-fat milk and plates of
high-fiber cookies and muffins for him, and that may help fend off
the effects of the other risk factors,'' said Sharon Sclabassi,
director of the American Heart Association's southwest Pennsylvania
office.

   Then as now, the invasion was launched in the
pre-dawn hours. Then as now, the declared goal was to protect
American citizens.
   But the similarities between the American landing on the
Caribbean island of Grenada on Oct. 25, 1983 _ the last time U.S.
troops were sent on an invasion _ and Wednesday's American
intervention in Panama are mostly superficial.
   Both were described as pre-emptive operations, but logistically
and strategically they are largely different.
   The invasion of Grenada, spearheaded by 1,900 Marines and Army
Rangers, was undertaken with the stated purpose of protecting the
lives of more than 600 American medical students from a Marxist
government that had taken the island's government by force Oct. 19.
   President Bush, too, said he had ordered U.S. troops into Panama
to protect the lives of Americans, this time an estimated 35,000,
many of them soldiers.
   The presidential statements justifying the invasions was similar.
   Said Reagan in 1983:
   ``The United States' objectives are clear: to protect our own
citizens, to facilitate the evacuation of those who want to leave,
and to help in the restoration of democratic institutions in
Grenada.''
   Said Bush on Wednesday:
   ``The Panamanian people want democracy, peace, and the chance
for a better life in dignity and freedom. The people of the United
States seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals.''
   In Panama, U.S. forces were under orders to capture Manuel
Antonio Noriega, the country's ruler who is under indictment in
Florida on drug-trafficking charges.
   While both presidents said they were acting to restore
democratic governments, the Grenada operation had broader regional
implications.
   Reagan had grown increasingly concerned since 1981 about what he
perceived as a Cuban and Soviet military buildup on Grenada.
   The U.S. invasion was lent legitimacy by a request from six tiny
eastern Caribbean nations for U.S. help to stop the military
buildup, which they believed could endanger their democratic
governments.
   Indeed, the U.S. force was accompanied by 300 police officers
and defense forces from four of Grenada's Caribbean neighbors.
   Although plans for both operations were long in the making _ the
Grenada invasion replicated a 1981 exercise _ the landing on
Grenada was much more of a surprise to the world. Many people
didn't even know how to pronounce the name of the nutmeg-producing
island and its new leader, Bernard Coard, while years of U.S.
clashes with the defiant and provocative Noriega have become almost
legend.
   The surprise six years ago was compounded by a lack of
information about the operation in Grenada because of a complete
Defense Department news blackout. Reporters were given access to
the island only on the fifth day.
   The fighting in Panama was closely covered from the start by the
resident news corps and, hours after the fighting began, by a pool
of U.S. reporters flown there by the Pentagon.
   In Panama, the U.S. invasion was supported and prepared by some
13,000 troops already stationed at American bases there. In
Grenada, there were no U.S. military personnel on hand before the
invasion.
   ``The logistics of getting there were much harder,'' said
Langhorne A. Motley, who served as assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs at the time of the Grenada invasion.
   The handkerchief-size Grenada _ 8 by 18 miles with a population
of less than 100,000 _ was a less complicated target than Panama,
with its 30,000 square miles and population of 2.3 million.
   ``Panama is a much messier place to operate, with Americans
scattered around the country'' and a professional, U.S.-trained
military, Motley said.
   In Grenada, the U.S. force _ which at the height of the invasion
numbered about 7,000 _ encountered a military force of several
thousand Soviet-armed troops, aided by about 600 armed Cubans there
to construct a 9,500-foot airport runway that the United States
said had no civilian use.
   Nineteen Americans were killed in Grenada, several of them in
accidents, as well as 24 Grenadans, most of them when U.S. planes
mistakenly bombed a mental hospital. Also killed were 24 Cubans.
   The actual fighting for control of the island lasted about 36
hours, said Otto Reich, a diplomat who headed the State Department
campaign to enlist public support for the Grenada operation. U.S.
troops stayed about seven weeks to defend the interim government
and clean up pockets of Cuban resistance.
   ``But there was no real urban warfare, unlike Panama,'' said
Reich.

<TEXT>
   Judith Jamison, a former dancer in the Alvin
Ailey American Dance Theater who left to work on Broadway and form
her own group, was named Wednesday as Ailey's successor as artistic
director of the company.
   Ailey, who founded the dance company 31 years ago, died Dec. 1.
   Miss Jamison said at a news conference at the company's school
that, earlier this year, Ailey told her he wanted her to succeed
him. ``He said, `You're going in another direction now.'''
   ``It's like coming home to a place I've been in my heart for
years, even if I haven't been here physically,'' she said.
   Miss Jamison joined the company in 1965, leaving 15 years later
to be one of the stars of ``Duke Ellington's Sophisticated Ladies''
on Broadway.
   Last year, she started the Jamison Project, for which she
choreographs and dances. The Jamison Project will continue through
June and some dancers and some dance works will enter the Ailey
company.
   The future of the Ailey company, Miss Jamison said, ``will
reflect his vision and mine. They're not one and the same.'' She
said changes will be ``a creative process we will be working on the
entire time I'm here.''
   ``Mr. Ailey's original idea was of having a family of dancers
who care that they're dancing, who remember where that blessing,
that talent, comes from, and want to share that with an audience.
So I would just like to continue that.''
   The Ailey company's New York season runs until Dec. 31. It will
tour in the United States in the spring, then perform in Singapore
in June and in three cities in the Soviet Union in September.

   U.S. troops smashed the regime of
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on Wednesday and installed a new
government, but the military ruler who antagonized a superpower
fled into hiding and his loyalists seized some Americans.
   More than 20,000 troops backed by warplanes began their invasion
shortly after midnight Tuesday under a full moon, pounding
Panamanian military installations in and around the capital with
mortar, cannon and machine-gun fire.
   In the early afternoon, smoke rose from the shattered
headquarters of Noriega's Defense Forces and sporadic gunfire was
heard in the distance. Widespread looting broke out.
   In the San Miguelito neighborhood to the northeast, attack jets
bombed and helicopters strafed a Defense Forces barracks atop a
hill.
   More than 50 bodies were counted by one hospital early in the
fighting but more bodies flooded in after daybreak. Officials in
Washington said nine American servicemen were among the dead.
Hundreds of people were wounded.
   President Bush said he ordered the invasion after Noriega said
Panama was in a state of war with the United States and after the
shooting death last week of a U.S. Marine lieutenant.
   He said the attack was a mission to capture Noriega and bring
him trial in the United States for allegedly trafficking in
Colombian cocaine.
   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in
Panama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens
in Panama,'' Bush said in speech to the nation.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said the action was
ordered after the administration received unconfirmed reports that
Noriega intended to attack a U.S. residential neighborhood in
Panama.
   Pamana's national radio reported about 40 Americans had been
``detained,'' while Cable News Network said at least 10 Americans
were held hostage. Troops loyal to Noriega were seen taking at
least two Americans away from Panama City's Marriott Hotel.
   Opposition leader Guillermo Endara, winner of the May 7
elections that were voided by the Noriega-controlled government,
was sworn in as president and given immediate U.S. backing.
   Bush later ordered that economic and political sanctions be
lifted and authorized federal drug agents to pursue arrests in
Panama.
   But provisional President Francisco Rodriguez and Foreign
Minsiter Leonardo Kam, both installed by Noriega, held a news
conference at the Foreign Ministry office in the capital and
declared they still governed.
   ``The government controls the situation in the country and its
institutions,'' Rodriguez said. ``We are prepared to resist.''
   It was clear, however, that U.S. troops controlled the capital.
   The huge assault by Marines, infantrymen, sailors, airmen and
paratroopers was the bloody pinnacle of Washington's long war with
Noriega, a bellicose career soldier who had a strong core of
support among working class people and who seemed to delight in
defying the mighty United States.
   Noriega survived two coup attempts from within the Panamanian
Defense Forces that he headed, including one October insurrection
in which he was briefly captured. He survived Washington's best
non-military efforts to oust him, including harsh economic
sanctions that severely depressed the economy.
   There was strong evidence in the two previous coup attempts of
dissatisfaction within the military with Noriega, and it was
unclear how much of his support was holding after the U.S. attack.
   In his address, Bush said he intends to turn over the Panama
Canal as required under existing treaties.
   Noriega has denied the drug charges and claims the United States
wanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cede
control of the Panama Canal by the year 2000.
   At the Fort Clayton U.S. base outside the capital, U.S. charge
d'affaires John Bushnell said Noriega ``may take to the hills and
be very hard to find ... but he wouldn't have a significant force
to actually do anything.''
   ``We will chase him, and we will find him,'' Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in Washington.
   Powell said that nine American servicemen were killed, 39 were
wounded and one was missing.
   Rodriguez said more than 60 Panamanians died in the fighting,
and several hundred were wounded, mostly civilians. He said U.S.
troops in the Chorillo area, where the fighting was heaviest, did
not allow the Red Cross to enter the area.
   A man indentified only as Major Caballero said on National Radio
that ``40 Americans have been detained,'' but that figure could not
be confirmed.
   Two paramilitary Panamanian troops arrived at the capital's
Marriott Hotel at about 9 a.m. and took away three Americans. The
soldiers then asked the front desk for a list of guests and where
they were staying. The desk said it did not give it to them.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said U.S. forces in Panama were
aware of hostages taken from the Marriott. ``We will make efforts
to take care of that,'' said Williams, declining to elaborate.
   Williams said he did not know how many Americans were being held.
   Earlier in the invasion, Panamanian troops held 12 foreigners at
the Marriott, including eight Americans, for about two hours.

   The Soviet Union condemned the U.S. attack as ``gunboat
diplomacy'' while Britain offered support. Peru expressed outrage
and recalled its Washington ambassador.
   Venezeula summed up many reactions by saying it opposed
Noriega's regime but condemned the U.S. military intervention.
   The U.N. Security Council was considering Nicaragua's request
for an emergency meeting to consider the U.S. intervention. At the
U.N. meeting, Panama ``will demand that the United States withdraw
its invading troops immediately,'' Rodriguez said.
   The U.S. assault began about midnight Tuesday as forces attacked
Panamanian military headquarters, which witnesses said was
destroyed.
   Fighting also was reported at a Panamanian cavalry unit about
seven miles east of the Defense Forces headquarters; and at the
Panamanian base Fort Cimarron, about 20 miles from the capital.
   About 9,500 American troops from bases in the United States were
flown in to augment the 12,000 soldiers based in Panama.
   Panama's Defense Forces has 15,000 men. Noriega also has armed
citizen ``Dignity Battalions.''
   Noriega's main bodyguard, Lt. Asuncion Gaitan, spoke on national
radio after dawn to say that Noriega was ``well and in a safe
place.''
   ``Don't anyone give up your positions,'' he said. Gaitan then
gave a series of messages using code names and instructions.
   Fighting continued after dawn in Old Panama, just east of the
Marriott, and in San Miguelito, a poor district northeast of the
city center.
   The Panama Canal was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting,
said Panama Canal Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon. He said
landslides had caused the only previous closings in the waterway's
75-year history.
   Panamanian forces attacked the U.S. Embassy, causing light
damage, and the area was secured by U.S. military personnel and
vehicles about 4:30 a.m., said a U.S. Embassy spokesman speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The only TV channels operating were the U.S. military network
and a Panamanian station that displayed a Department of Defense
shield. Radio Nacional claimed that Defense Forces had shot down a
U.S. helicopter.
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic and
political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug
trafficking charges in February 1988.
   Bush was criticized for not ordering U.S. troops to help the
mutineers during the October coup attempt. American soldiers
blocked some routes to Defense Forces headquarters, but not all,
and Noriega loyalists rescued him.
   On Friday, Noriega's rubber-stamp government declared the
country was in a ``state of war'' with the United States and named
the general head of state to deal with the threat. A day later, a
U.S. Marine lieutenant was shot to death by Panamanians in what
American officials called an unprovoked attack.
   American troops in Panama had been on maximum alert and
restricted to base since the lieutenant was killed Saturday and an
American Navy couple was held and the woman threatened sexually.
   On Monday, a U.S. Army officer wounded a Panamanian policeman
because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon, according to
the U.S. Southern Command.

   The former president of the Indianapolis
League of Women Voters and her two sons were behind bars today
after being extradited from Austria on charges of running a major
marijuana smuggling ring.
   Less than 24 hours after their extradition, Linda Leary and
Richard and Paul Heilbrunn appeared in shackles Tuesday before a
U.S. magistrate and were then jailed for a hearing Friday on
whether to free them on bail before trial Feb. 13.
   ``The evidence we'll present will likely keep them detained,''
U.S. Attorney Deborah said.
   A 1987 indictment named them among 34 people charged with
operating an 11-state ring that moved at least 250,000 pounds of
marijuana _ one of the biggest such drug operations ever uncovered.
They were arrested in May in Austria.
   Before leaving the United States in 1985, Leary, 58, was
president of the Indianapolis League of Women Voters and the local
chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women.
   Paul Heilbrunn, 35, was a commodities broker and columnist for a

and two children on a farm outside Indianapolis.
   ``This is a major milestone,'' Daniels said. ``Though we had
felt confident that they would be home by the end of the year, it's
good to see that process complete.''
   Daniels and her staff waited for months while Justice Department
officials in Washington processed hundreds of pages of documents,
translated them into German and moved them through the State
Department to Austria.
   Of those indicted, 20 have been convicted, five are awaiting
trial, five remain at large, and two have been acquitted, Assistant
U.S. Attorney Jack Thar said. Charges against two were dismissed.
   Paul Heilbrunn, the alleged ringleader, faces possible life
imprisonment on charges including conspiracy to import and
distribute marijuana and running a continual criminal enterprise.
   Richard Heilbrunn faces up to 60 years in prison and Leary as
much as 30.
   The indictment says the ring operated in Indiana, California,
Connecticut, Washington, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South
Carolina, Florida, Michigan and Virginia.

   The Consumer Product Safety Commission staff
on Wednesday recommended that the agency require child-resistant
containers for two cosmetic products that pose a risk of poisoning
for young children who might accidentally swallow the preparations.
   ``They can cause severe toxic effects in humans and pose a risk
of serious injury or death to young children,'' said Virginia
White, a project manager in the CPSC's chemical hazards program, in
testimony at a commission hearing.
   White recommended the agency require special packaging for
artificial fingernail glue removers containing acetonitrile and
home permanent hair-wave neutralizers with sodium or potassium
bromate.
   ``Child-resistant packaging is readily available ... and the
costs for complying with a special packaging regulation are
estimated to be low relative to the potential benefits,'' she added.
   The commission deferred voting on the package requirements, but
White said the procedural nature of commissioners' questions
indicated they would follow the staff recommendations and require
the child-proof containers.
   Acetonitrile is used as a solvent in liquids used by manicurists
to remove artificial sculptured fingernails, hobbyists in model
building and as a general household glue remover.
   Material compiled by the agency's staff said a 16-month-old
California boy died in 1987 after swallowing up to two tablespoons
of sculptured nail remover. Three other children under the age of
five also were seriously injured after ingesting similar products
containing acetonitrile, the report said.
   Staff researchers found 17 cases _ one involving the death of a
17-month-old child and one that resulted in permanent hearing loss
and kidney damage to a 16-month-old _ of accidential ingestion of
bromate neutralizers since 1947.
   Neutralizers are used to stop the action of chemicals used in
permanent hair-wave products.
   Preparations with sodium and potassium bromates were commonly
used during the 1940s and 1950s but had virtually disappeared from
the market after being replaced by products with alternative
ingredients, White said. Recently, however, several smaller
manufacturers have again begun adding the bromates to neutralizers,
she said.
   White said it would cost manufacturers of both types of products
2 to 7 cents per package to add the containers child resistant.
   More than $5 million in glue removers are sold for cosmetic and
hobby use annually, the staff materials said. Sales of permanent
wave products, including those containing bromates, were put at
$107.6 million in 1987.
   The staff recommendation would require that any product
containing acetonitrile be in a child-resistant container.
   Both products are sold in supermarkets, drug stores and retail
and wholesale beauty supply outlets.
   The American Association of Poison Control Centers, Inc. had
asked to commission to require the child-resistant packaging. The
petition was supported by the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance
Association and the California Department of Health Services.
   Wednesday's hearing was the first on product safety since
Jacqueline Jones-Smith became chairman of the panel last month. The
commission has been without a quorum for most of 1989 and could not
meet to conduct official business.

   Death rates for Medicare patients were higher
in 1988 than federal projections at 3.4 percent of the nation's
nearly 6,000 hospitals, the government said Wednesday.
   Thirty-two hospitals, including six public hospitals in Puerto
Rico, have had higher-than-projected rates for three consecutive
years. Four had fewer deaths than projected during the same period,
officials said.
   However, federal health officials cautioned that the report ``is
not a direct measure of the quality of care'' and should not be
used to judge hospitals as good or bad.
   The report said 196 hospitals, or 3.4 percent of U.S. hospitals,
had higher-than-expected death rates in 1988.
   That compares with 194 such hospitals in 1987 and 187 in 1986,
according to revised figures. Data for those years were recomputed
to account for different risk factors added to the calculations of
the 1988 projections.
   At the other end of the scale, 51 hospitals, or 0.9 percent,
were found to have Medicare death rates lower than projected.
Applying the revised calculations, such hospitals numbered 48 in
1987 and 40 in 1986.
   Although the statistics were based solely on admissions of
Medicare patients, officials said they believe the rates are
reflective of the general population.
   The information in the third annual report on Medicare hospital
patient death rates was compiled by the Health Care Financing
Administration.
   Thomas Morford, director of the agency's health standards and
quality bureau, said it would be unfair and inaccurate to label the
facilities whose death rates were outside the projected ranges as
the nation's best or worst hospitals.
   ``This is not a one-to-one measure of quality of care,'' he said.
   Rather, the information is intended to be one indicator of
quality of care and consumers should use it to ask more informed
questions when assessing a hospital's strengths and weaknesses, he
said.
   The names of the 32 hospitals with repeatedly
higher-than-expected death rates were released with the caveat that
it ``does not necessarily mean that the care at these hospitals was
substandard nor that these hospitals are the poorest performing
acute care hospitals in the United States.''
   Twenty of the hospitals are public facilities, five are private
non-profit hospitals, three are private for-profit and four are run
by churches.
   The four hospitals with repeatedly lower rates included two
public hospitals and two private facilities, one for-profit and one
non-profit.
   Asked about the significance that six Puerto Rican hospitals,
more than any one state, have had repeatedly higher rates, Morford
said: ``At this point, I'm not drawing anything from anything. ...
Obviously we are going to make some inquiries as to the care at
(all 32) hospitals.''
   Morford said Martin Luther King Jr. General Hospital in Los
Angeles is an example of a hospital that consistently exceeded
projected death rates for Medicare patients but recently improved
conditions remarkably. The hospital was told last year that it
would no longer receive Medicare reimbursement unless improvements
were made.
   Though the Los Angeles hospital is on the list of 32, ``over the
past three months they have done extraordinary things to bring
themselves into compliance,'' Morford said.
   In comments included in the report, some hospitals took
exception to the agency's projected ranges, some noted data errors
and others said the ranges don't adequately reflect that many of
their patients are sicker when they arrive at the hospital and more
likely to die.
   For some hospitals, death rates were less than 1 percentage
point over the upper bound of the projected range.
   The financing agency, a unit of the Department of Health and
Human Services, said one of the studies it conducted using the
report's data indicates that large urban hospitals and publicly
owned hospitals are more likely to have quality problems and higher
death rates than other hospitals.
   As another measure of quality, officials said a study by agency
staff and researchers at the Medical Colleges of Wisconsin shows
that hospitals with a larger percentage of board-certified
physicians, registered nurses, higher payroll expenses and more
access to high-technology facilities are more likely to have lower
mortality rates.
   The hospital mortality report calculates the rates for all
causes of Medicare deaths as well as for each of 16 diagnostic
categories, including cancer, heart disease and stroke. It provides
such general information as the number of beds, interns, residents
and registered nurses, as well as the types of specialty services
offered.
   Medicare pays hospital and doctor bills for about 33 million
Americans who are over 65, blind or disabled.

   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said
Wednesday the United States acted in self-defense when it sent its
military forces to Panama to oust military leader Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega from power.
   Alejandro Serrano Caldera, the ambassador of Nicaragua, which
called for an emergency Security Council meeting, retorted that
``the United States has no legal or ethical right to intervene in
other countries' affairs.''
   Speaking outside the council chambers, Serrano Caldera said the
Panamanian people ``have the right to self-determination; this
action by the United States violated the sovereignty of the
Panamanian people.''
   ``We want the council to call for an immediate withdrawal of the
U.S. troops,'' Serrano Caldera said, speaking in Spanish.
   Nicaragua's U.N. mission announced the Sandinista government had
declared a national alert and mobilized troops against what
President Daniel Ortega said was Washington's ``serious threat
against Nicaragua.''
   Security Council ambassadors met individually in the morning and
scheduled private consultations for the rest of the day; it was
unclear whether a formal, public meeting would be held.
   Pickering said the United States had the right to intervene
under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, ``which provides for the use
of armed force to defend a country, to defend our interests and our
people, it's the so-called `self-defense article.'''
   Panamanian soldiers shot and killed a U.S. Marine officer at a
roadblock on Saturday night.
   Panama's declaration last week that a ``state of war'' existed
with the United States and ``the attacks on our citizens over the
weekend are several of the things which the president has cited
which required us to move in self-defense,'' Pickering said.
   Article 51 of the Charter permits the use of ``individual or
collective self-defense if an armed attack occurs against a member
of the United Nations, until the Security Council has taken
measures necessary to maintain international peace and security.''
   Pickering said he was talking with council members and favored
more consultations before any public meeting is held.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
ordered U.S. troops to seize Noriega and bring him to the United
States for trial on drug trafficking charges.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III informed Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar of the military moves at 2 a.m. Wednesday,
said the U.N. chief's spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   Perez de Cuellar is ``extremely concerned'' about the crisis,
Giuliani said.
   Panama repeatedly has come before the Security Council to
complain of allegedly provocative U.S. military maneuvers it said
were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple the
government.
   In August, Panamanian Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter asked the
council to send military observers to his country to prevent the
U.S. Army from goading confrontations as a pretext for armed
intervention.
   U.N. military observers, said Ritter, ``will insure that the
reality of the situation cannot be hidden and it will be recorded
in the annals of history as a crime.''
   However, Panama did not have any nation on the council introduce
a resolution to send observers, a necessary step toward sending a
mission.
   Panama said in April and August that the United States is trying
to provoke confrontations in order to keep control of the Panama
Canal. Under a 1977 treaty, the United States is to turn over
control of the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.

<HEAD>Children From Chernobyl Area Arrive For Holiday In Israel</HEAD>

   A group of 52 Soviet teen-agers who were
exposed to radiation during the Chernobyl nuclear accident arrived
in Israel on Wednesday for a three-week holiday.
   The children, guests of Israel's United Kibbutz Movement, came
under an agreement on youth exchanges signed by Israel's
Agriculture Minister Abraham Katz-Oz in Moscow this month.
   Katz-Oz and Vice Premier Shimon Peres were waiting at the Ben
Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv for the excited children, brought by a
special Soviet Aeroflot airlines flight from Moscow.
   ``We know what you have suffered and we all hope the warm sun of
this country will be of benefit to you,'' Peres said. ``What we,
the older people, have lost, you the young ones can regain by
bringing understanding between our two peoples.''
   ``We shall pray that you should gain complete freedom, you pray
for us that we should achieve complete peace, and we both shall
pray for better understanding between our countries,'' he said.
   The Soviet children, aged 14 to 16, were also greeted by Israeli
youths of their own age from five kibbutzim, or collective farms,
in the southern Negev desert.
   The young guests will spend several days in the Negev and will
also visit Negev's capital of Beersheba and the Galilee,
Agriculture Ministry spokesman Naftali Yaniv said.
   The Soviet children are not suffering from any radiation-related
diseases following the April 1986 accident at Chernobyl, the worst
ever involving a nuclear reactor. But they will be under medical
observation by local doctors and some may undergo closer check-ups
in Israeli hospitals.
   Another group of 50 children from the Chernobyl area is due to
arrive in Israel next year. The exchange program would encompass
1,000 youths aged 15 to 17 from both countries.
   ``This is only one of the agreements signed by Katz-Oz,'' Yaniv
said. ``We hope that next week we can start to implement the second
agreement, on the supply of fresh Israeli agricultural products to
Moscow region.''
   Katz-Oz, the first Israeli minister to travel to Moscow in at
least 22 years, was invited there by the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
   The $30 million agricultural agreement stipulates export of
90,000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables to the Moscow region,
which consumes 2.5 million tons a year. A third party, in return,
would sell Soviet goods for hard currency and transfer the money to
Israel.
   The Soviet Union cut diplomatic ties with Israel following the
1967 Middle East War. The countries exchanged low-level diplomatic
missions in 1987-88 and are developing cultural and economic ties.

   Lithuanian Communists voted
overwhelmingly Wednesday to form an independent party, breaking
Moscow's iron political unity for the first time in Soviet history.
   The Lithuanian party's congress of 1,038 delegates voted to
declare themselves an ``equal partner,'' rather than a subordinate,
of the Soviet Communist Party.
   Delegates at the Vilnius Opera and Ballet Theater stood for a
sustained ovation after the vote result was announced: 855 voted
for independence, with 160 for retaining subordination to the
Moscow party.
   Party chief Algirdas Brazauskas congratulated the congress and
expressed the ``hope and wish that our party will always be
resolute, rejuvinated and ready for new battles.''
   The party declared in a resolution it would ``maintain relations
of equal partnership with the Soviet Communist Party, other
progressive parties, public organizations and movements.''
   ``The major goals of the Lithuanian Communist Party are an
independent, democratic Lithuanian state, implementation of the
ideals of humanistic socialism, liberty and social justice,
creation of adequate living conditions for the Lithuanian people
and all the inhabitants of Lithuania,'' the resolution said.
   The break runs counter to more than 80 years of Communist Party
practice and polcy. Since before the 1917 Russian Revolution,
Vladimir I. Lenin demanded a unified party covering the entire
territory of the czarist empire. In 1921, the party formally
outlawed the existence of factions.
   The vote came after two days of tough exchanges between the
majority seeking a break with Moscow and the minority, mostly
ethnic Slavs, who opposed it.
   ``I believe that the formation of this kind of independent party
leads practically to its annihilation,'' said Stefanya
Serzhantovich, a tractor driver from rural Vilnius who is a
congress delegate.
   But Brazauskas and other party leaders said such a split,
including drafting a separate party program, was necessary for
Lithuanian Communists to compete in Feb. 24 elections.
   The Communists, who supported a legislative move Dec. 7 to
strike the leading role of the party from the Baltic republic's
Constitution, will have to compete with the grassroots political
movement Sajudis and other newly formed parties in the local
elections.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had appealed to the Lithuanians,
most recently through party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev, not
to split, saying doing so would hurt his reform effort.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, a conservative member of the ruling
Politburo, said in Moscow the Lithuanian party's action ``is great
trouble for the people and for the Communists.''
   He said the Lithuanians ``just do not realize yet what grief
will descend.''
   Lithuanian party documents set a goal of restoring the
republic's complete political independence, something Gorbachev has
warned could upset the balance of a rapidly changing era.
   Lithuania's action was the latest in a series of radical steps
taken by Communist parties in Eastern Europe, which have ended
their monopoly on political power and allowed other parties to form.
   Writer Raimondas Kasauskas told the delegates that an
independent Lithuania was no danger to the Soviet Union, ``just
like the existence of a peaceful Finland or Denmark is not bad,
just like the changes in Hungary don't mean anything bad.''
   ``It would be a disaster if the results of the voting would not
meet the aspirations of the people,'' he said.
   Arvydas Matulionis, of Lithuania's Institute of Society,
Philosophy and Law, told delegates 56 percent of local residents
polled Nov. 30 approved of a separate Communist Party.
   He said 61 percent of the party members polled approved of the
idea.
   Sajudis observers say local Communist Parties in other republics
such as Latvia, Estonia, Georgia and Armenia could follow
Lithuania's example soon and present Gorbachev with a splintered
party when he convenes the 28th national party congress next fall.
   Ethnic Lithuanians make up about 80 percent of its 3.7 million
people. Russians make up about 10 percent, and there are smaller
populations of Poles and other ethnic groups.

   A jury today began deliberating whether
Larry Mahoney is guilty of murder for each of the 27 people killed
in a fiery 1987 collision between his pickup and a church bus.
   The jury received the case after Mahoney's lawyers contended in
closing arguments that the bus was unsafe and that the factory
worker is not responsible for the deaths. Prosecutor Paul
Richwalsky countered that bus safety was not the issue, adding,
``The apologies ... are too late. Now it's time to pay.''
   Mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder, 12 of assault, 42
of wanton endangerment and one of drunken-driving in what
authorities have called the nation's deadliest alcohol-related
traffic accident.
   Twenty-four youngsters and three adults from a church group died
in the fire that engulfed the former school bus after Mahoney's
pickup rammed it on Interstate 71, five miles south of Carrollton,
on May 14, 1988.
   The chassis of the 1977 school bus was made by Ford Motor Co.
Mahoney's attorneys argued during his murder trial that the bus was
unsafe because of a vulnerable gas tank and combustible interior
materials.
   ``Somebody should pay for it,'' said Jack Hildebrand, one of
Mahoney's three attorneys. ``But Larry Mahoney should not have to
pay for something Ford Motor Company did.''
   Hildebrand and another defense attorney, William Summers, told
the jury that Mahoney was intoxicated and was driving on the wrong
side of the interstate. That caused the collision but not the fiery
deaths, they said.
   ``Larry has the rest of his life, every waking minute, to
remember this,'' Summers said. No one ``can do anything to punish
him worse.''
   The prosecutor argued that Mahoney's attorneys mounted an attack
on the safety of the school bus out of desperation because no one
could deny that Mahoney caused the crash.
   ``School buses don't have anything to do with it,'' Richwalsky
said. ``The elements of the alleged crime would be the same if
Mahoney had collided with a motorcycle or a family car.''
   The jury received instructions from Judge Charles Satterwhite on
Tuesday.
   Satterwhite gave the jury two alternatives to the 27 murder
charges _ second-degree manslaughter, punishable by five to 10
years in prison, and reckless homicide, punishable by one to five
years. Murder is punishable by 20 years to life.
   To convict the 36-year-old Mahoney of murder, the jury would
have to find that he had acted with ``extreme indifference to the
value of human life,'' Satterwhite told the panel.
   Richwalsky contended that Mahoney's actions _ driving drunk and
on the wrong side of a highway _ fit that description.
   The defense has claimed that Mahoney did not intentionally get
drunk and that the former school bus, manufactured by Ford and
Sheller-Globe Corp., was unsafe. Autopsies showed the fire, not the
crash, killed the victims.
   Satterwhite told jurors they would be sequestered, spending
nights in a motel under sheriff's guard, until reaching a verdict.
Once sequestered, jurors could not be released, even for Christmas,
the prosecutor said.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III notified
Congress today that the U.S. embassy in Moscow will be torn down
and a new one erected in its place.
   The decision, pending for months, was based on U.S. intelligence
conclusions that the Soviets had implanted sophisticated listening
devices in the structure.
   Rep. Olympia Snowe of Maine said she was ``extremely pleased''
by the decision. The ranking Republican member of the House
Operations subcommittee, she had concluded after inspecting the
embassy in April 1987 that tearing it down was the best solution.
   Another option weighed by the State Department was saving part
of the building after demolishing areas thought to be infiltrated.
   Kirk Walder, spokesman for Ms. Snowe, said Baker told her
construction of a new embassy would be undertaken ``under stringent
security safeguards and in full cooperation with intelligence
agencies.''

   In another time, another president said he
would not see the United States made into ``a pitiful, helpless
giant.'' The phrase echoed as President Bush ordered American
troops to crush and capture Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose
Panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of American sanctions
short of force.
   Part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours
on Wednesday with the Pentagon declaring that Noriega had been
decapitated as the strongarm leader of Panama.
   But he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his
loyalist forces. The United States called him a fugitive, and said
he would be tracked and taken, to stand trial on U.S. drug
trafficking indictments.
   For more than two years, Noriega had taunted and incited the
giant, while his foes at home and in Washington tried futilely to
dislodge his grip on power. Bush, whose watchword is prudence, said
it was an enormous frustration. But he took it for nearly a year,
for lack of an acceptable alternative.
   Then he took a risk, and went to war. ``Fellow citizens, last
night I ordered U.S. military forces to Panama,'' he told the
nation Wednesday. ``...I took this action only after reaching the
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of
American citizens were in grave danger.''
   Bush gained prompt and predictable support at home, from
Democrats as well as Republicans. He had briefed congressional
leaders just before U.S. forces went into combat against Noriega's
loyalists in the Panama Defense Forces.
   Presidents seldom face much political dissent when American
forces are in combat, especially with the kind of provocations
Noriega provided. His puppet assembly had declared a state of war
with the United States, and an off-duty American officer was shot
and killed by his forces on Saturday.
   Bush recounted the killing, the wounding of another American
serviceman, the capture and beating of a third and threats against
his wife.
   ``That was enough,'' the president said.
   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in
Panama created an eminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens in
Panama,'' Bush said. ``...And that is why I directed our armed
forces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama, and to
bring Gen. Noriega to justice in the United States.''
   Bush had repeatedly encouraged Noriega's opponents to kick him
out of power. He had said that Noriega was the problem, that the
United States quarrel was with the general, not with the Panama
Defense Forces, and that his ouster would instantly restore normal
diplomatic and economic relations.
   Yet when dissident PDF officers attempted a coup on Oct. 3 and
briefly held Noriega, American forces stood by, inactive. U.S.
forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders,
but the administration decided against intervention.
   That drew protests from left and right, although some
Republicans complained that dovish Democrats who opposed
intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in
Panama.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said U.S. commanders had
been told they could offer support for the coup ``if there were an
opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant
loss of American life and to do so without open military
involvement...''
   Those instructions ring with irony now that U.S. forces have
been sent into open combat.
   On Wednesday, Baker recalled his October testimony, and the
administration explanation of U.S. inaction at the time of the coup
attempt.
   ``I said if this administration chose to use force, it would
make its own decisions,'' he told a news conference. ``It would not
act based on some unknown coup plotters' strategy or rationale.''
   At least 11 American soldiers were killed in action early
Wednesday, others wounded.
   That is the price of using military power. It was Richard M.
Nixon who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use, 19 years
ago. ``If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful
nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless
giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free
nations and free institutions throughout the world,'' he said,
announcing he had sent forces to attack Communist North Vietnamese
sanctuaries in Cambodia.
   Bush ordered about 7,000 troops into Panama to join some 12,000
already stationed there as the Panama Canal garrison. Another 2,500
reinforcements were being deployed Wednesday.
   Later, there are sure to be told-you-so comments from those who
argued the administration should have sent forces to join the
October coup.
   And Noriega's purge of dissident PDF officers after that coup
could make it more difficult for the United States to quickly
complete operations and withdraw the additional troops, which Bush
said he wants to do as quickly as possible.
   The newly-installed government of Panama _ led by Guillermo
Endara, thought to have won the May election Noriega annulled _
will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in
place of his henchmen.
   Stability under an elected government will be the real test of
success, whatever happens to Noriega. The administration has been
wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle. American
intervention puts that to the tes: if the theory is correct and he
is powerless, Noriega is irrelevant.
   But if Noriega or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and
running continuing operations against U.S. forces and the Endara
government, the administration will have a major problem on its
hands.
   When President Ronald Reagan ordered American forces into action
in the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 air raid on Libya, the
operations were swift and brief. The Bush administration wants
intervention in Panama to be a mission accomplished and quickly
ended. Prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at
home and intensify the inevitable Latin American resentment against
Yankee intervention, no matter the cause.
   Bush sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out
swiftly, by lifting economic sanctions against Panama under the new
Endara government, and by promising anew that the United States
will turn the canal over to Panama at the end of the century.

   Bomb-sniffing dogs and dozens of
police provided security today at the funeral of a federal judge
killed by a parcel bomb in a wave of attacks that may have been
carried out by white racists.
   More than 700 mourners, including Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh and FBI Director William S. Sessions, filled a suburban
church for the service in memory of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance.
   Vance was a man ``who stood up for the underdog and the
oppressed,'' his friend U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford of
Birmingham told mourners. ``No wonder his assassins could not stand
such a man in their presence.''
   The 58-year-old Vance was killed by a package bomb Saturday. FBI
agents say the bomb and three others, including the one that killed
Savannah, Ga., lawyer Robert Robinson, 42, on Monday, all bore
Georgia return addresses or postmarks.
   Links to NAACP school desegregation efforts have been
established in all four cases, leading investigators to speculate
that a white racist group may be responsible. After police defused
a bomb at an NAACP office in Jacksonville, Fla., Tuesday, the
organization placed all its offices on alert.
   Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war on
various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the
bombings, FBI spokesman Greg Jones said today in Washington.
   St. Luke's Episcopal Church, in a quiet area of this wooded,
exclusive suburb of Birmingham, was surrounded by police barriers
as part of security precautions that included bomb searches and
guards.
   Among those attending was Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy,
who oversees Vance's appellate circuit. Vance's wife, Helen,
remained hospitalized from wounds received in the bombing.
   Family friends said Vance's body had been cremated and his ashes
will be placed in the church.
   In Baltimore today, NAACP executive director Benjamin Hooks said
the attacks will not prevent the NAACP from ``moving forward full
speed ahead on the job of trying to make America a place of equal
justice for all.''
   ``I think it's the work of white supremacists without any
question. I think it reveals the derangement, demented, criminally
stupid minds,'' Hooks said.
   Hooks said he had been assured by Sessions and Thornburgh that
the bombings were being given the highest priority.
   William Hinshaw, agent in charge of the Atlanta FBI office, told
The Birmingham News in an interview published today that the deadly
package addressed to Vance was mailed Thursday from Newnan, a town
of about 11,500 people 30 miles southwest of Atlanta.
   The bomb that killed Robinson on Monday is believed to have been
mailed Friday from Macon, 82 miles southeast of Atlanta, Hinshaw
said, but the postmark was destroyed in the blast.
   The Atlanta Constitution quoted unidentified sources as saying
it bore a return address in Warner Robins, a town near Macon.
   The bomb found Tuesday in Jacksonville also was mailed Friday
from Macon, Hinshaw said. A Jacksonville NAACP official, Lloyd N.
Pearson, told the Macon Telegraph and News the package bore the
return address of a Warner Robins lawyer.
   Another device was mailed Saturday from the Atlanta area to the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals clerk's office in Atlanta,
Hinshaw said, and the Constitution reported it bore the return
address of an Atlanta lawyer. The court, on which Vance served,
handled appeals of federal cases from Georgia, Alabama and Florida.
   That bomb was removed safely. All four bombs reportedly were
designed to hurl nails or shrapnel.
   Sessions told reporters that some organized group could be
responsible for the bombs. He said a pattern of racist attacks
``has to be one of the factors in the back of all our minds.''
   ``Common sense would tell you _ the number of incidents ... in
three different states, all part of the 11th Circuit. It's quite
possible there is more than one (person responsible),'' Sessions
said.
   Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, said he believed an
organized group was behind the attacks. He instructed the civil
rights group's 1,800 offices to take precautions in handling mail.
   Hooks also said he fears the bombings were the beginning of a
wave of attacks: ``The thing has come to the place where everyone
may be in jeopardy, from the president on down.''
   One possible link between the cases was the NAACP's efforts to
desegregate Southern schools, authorities said. Evidence included:
   _Vance wrote the 11th Circuit's unanimous opinion three months
ago that ruled in favor of the NAACP in a desegregation suit
against the Jacksonville, Fla., schools.
   _Robinson, a black city alderman, represented the NAACP in
another desegregation case involving Savannah area schools. On
Sept. 29, an 11th Circuit panel that didn't include Vance upheld a
desegregation plan opposed by the NAACP.
   _The Jacksonsville NAACP chapter talked with Robinson about its
desegregation case, but Robinson did not represent them. ``He gave
us some advice,'' said the Rev. Fred Newbill, pastor of the First
Timothy Baptist Church.
   Vance and Robinson shared a moderate-to-progressive political
stance and an interest in civil rights, but friends of the two
believed they had never met.

<HEAD>Oregon Lawmaker Wants Clean Air Act Amendment</HEAD>

   National parks need special protection from
air pollution that the Environmental Protection Agency has failed
to provide, an Oregon lawmaker said Wednesday in calling for a
special amendment to the Clean Air Act.
   ``Manmade pollution is creeping into our parks and wildernesses,
robbing us of what makes them special,'' Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,
said at a news conference. He was joined by former Arizona Gov.
Bruce Babbitt.
   The problem is especially acute in the open spaces of the West,
which scientists believe are particularly vulnerable to sulfur
dioxide and other pollutants, he said.
   The problem has gotten so bad, he said later in an interview,
that polluted air has become as much a health problem as a
visibility problem. He said it is affecting visibility at airports,
observatories on isolated peaks and military testing grounds.
   ``Federal officials have a choice: Either clean up our parks or
adopt rules to warn Americans of health problems they may face from
visiting polluted parks,'' he said.
   The 1977 Clean Air Act contains a provision to protect the
national park system against visual pollution. But Wyden said EPA
has concentrated only on the ``simple problem of plume blight _
pollution from a few distinct sources near the park.''
   Wyden said he would try to amend the act in the Energy and
Commerce Committee early next year. The Senate will be taking up
its version of the bill as its top priority in 1990.
   Wyden's proposal would require EPA to identify sources of
emissions, provide for federal implementation of controls if states
do not act, broaden the categories of areas protected and give
federal park and wilderness officials earlier notice of permit
applications.

<TEXT>
   An appeals court Wednesday reviewed
evidence against a Palestinian suspect in the Pan Am Flight 103
bombing amid heightened security for the first anniversary of the
disaster.
   Another court in Uppsala will announce its verdict Thursday
against the Palestinian, Mohammed Abu Talb, on separate charges of
murder and attempted murder for bombs directed against U.S. and
Jewish targets in northern Europe in 1985 and 1986.
   Abu Talb faces a maximum life sentence, which in Sweden means 20
years or less. If convicted, he still could be extradited to stand
trial in a foreign country on charges related to the Dec. 21, 1988,
explosion over Lockerbie, Scotland, legal experts said.
   Scottish detectives questioned Abu Talb in the Flight 103 case
Tuesday, but the Swedish news agency TT reported that he refused to
cooperate.
   Abu Talb was charged on one count of murder in the death of a
passerby from a bomb outside the Northwest Orient airline office in
Copenhagen in 1985. He was accused in other bombings in Amsterdam
and Stockholm.
   The 35-year-old former Egyptian army soldier and member of the
Palestine Popular Struggle Front has lived in Sweden for six years.
   As friends and relatives of the 270 people killed on Flight 103
gathered in Lockerbie for the anniversary of the bombing,
anti-terrorism experts in Sweden warned of possible attacks
Thursday to mark the occasion.
   They said a guilty verdict by the Uppsala court could increase
the risk of a vengeance attack. Tougher security checks were being
imposed in airports around Sweden, TT said.
   Foreign Minister Sten Andersson, who has been active in Middle
East diplomacy for the last two years, took a charter plane for his
travels in Europe and was assigned extra bodyguards, the
Aftonbladet newspaper reported.
   Suspicion of a link to the Flight 103 case arose when it was
established that Abu Talb visited Malta before the bombing. He is
believed to possess clothing from the same store to which
detectives traced clothes from the bomb-rigged suitcase.
   According to one theory, the bomb was brought from Malta to
Frankfurt, where it was loaded onto Flight 103.
   The Stockholm appeals court was reviewing the legality of the
seizure of clothing Nov. 27 from Abu Talb's home in Uppsala, a
university town north of Stockholm.
   An Uppsala court had approved the removal of 15 bags of clothing
and authorized the Scottish police to take the evidence to Britain
for analysis. Abu Talb's lawyer appealed the decision.
   TT said the court was weighing whether the suspicions against
Abu Talb justified upholding the lower court's ruling.

   The invasion of Panama by American troops is
the latest in nearly 20 episodes over the past 150 years in which
the United States has used its military might in Latin America and
the Caribbean.
   Prior to the action in Panama, the most recent outright use of
U.S. force in the region was six years ago, on Oct. 25, 1983, when
U.S. forces led an invasion of the island of Grenada.
Then-President Reagan said his aim was to rescue American students
and to end Cuban use of the Caribbean nation as a training ground
for terrorists.
   In April 1965, President Johnson sent U.S. troops to the
Dominican Republic after rebels tried to seize power. Johnson said
he was acting to protect U.S. citizens and to prevent Communists
from taking power. Some members of the Organization of American
States also sent troops. A truce was signed a month after the U.S.
forces arrived and all were withdrawn by September 1966.
   U.S. Marines also had occupied the Dominican Republic from
1916-1924 to keep order among rival political factions.
   Short of combat, troops in recent years were stationed at the
Panama Canal and military advisers were sent to Honduras and El
Salvador to train the military forces of friendly Central American
governments. The United States has also supported the Contra rebels
seeking to oust the Sandinista government in Nicaragua.
   Support for the Contras is the latest phase in a long saga of
U.S. involvement in Nicaragua. About 2,500 Marines were sent in
1912 to protect the government and about 100 of them remained for
13 years.
   The United States also sent gunboats and troops to Nicaragua in
1926 to help the government during a rebellion led by Gen. Augusto
Cesar Sandino. U.S. planes bombed guerilla strongholds, eventually
forcing Sandino to flee to Mexico. The U.S. troops withdrew in
early 1933.
   Further back in history, two episodes helped make the
reputations of future U.S. presidents: Gen. Zachary Taylor's
capture of Buena Vista in the Mexican War and Theodore Roosevelt's
charge up San Juan Hill in the Spanish-American War. In 1961,
President John F. Kennedy's administration would be shaken after
U.S. failure to deliver military backing to Cuban exiles seeking to
foster revolution in their homeland.
   It was more than 80 years ago when U.S. troops first landed in
Panama.
   Then, the troops were deployed to support a fledgling Panamanian
government that had revolted against Colombian rule in late 1903.
The United States had failed to convince Colombia to support the
Panama Canal project but the new Panamanian government endorsed it,
beginning the U.S. presence in the southernmost country of Central
America.
   That first use of American military power in Panama came nearly
50 years after U.S. troops ventured onto Latin American soil in a
war with Mexico.
   A decade after Texans revolted against the Mexican government,
U.S. soldiers crossed into Mexico in 1846, beginning a war that
gave the United States land that is now California, Nevada, Utah
and parts of Arizona and New Mexico.
   Americans ultimately occupied much of Mexico and the war brought
fame to Zachary Taylor, whose forces won the battle of Buena Vista
in 1847. That victory catapulted Taylor to the presidency, and the
war ended in 1848.
   It would be 67 years before U.S. troops again invaded Mexico,
this time to seize the shipping port Veracruz after U.S. sailors
were arrested in Tampico. President Woodrow Wilson ordered the 1914
seizure to block arms shipments to Mexican forces.
   In 1916, Gen. John J. Pershing was sent into Mexico in an
unsuccessful bid to capture revolutionary leader Francisco Pancho
Villa, blamed for the deaths of 16 Americans during an incursion
into Columbus, N.M.
   Wilson also set U.S. Marines to quell political unrest in Haiti
in 1915. They remained until 1934.
   It was the Spanish-American War of 1898 that brought U.S. forces
to Cuba and Puerto Rico.
   The U.S. battleship Maine was off the coast of Cuba when it
mysteriously exploded in February 1898. President William McKinley,
who had sent the ship there to protect U.S. interests in Cuba
during an uprising against Spanish rule, blamed Spain for the
explosion and declared war.
   Five months later, U.S troops landed in Puerto Rico, then
controlled by Spain. Theodore Roosevelt's exploits at San Juan Hill
helped set him on the road to the presidency.
   Puerto Rico would later become a U.S. commonwealth. Cuba would
experience a period of turmoil that intermittently involved U.S.
forces.
   Most American troops left Cuba in 1902 after elections and an
agreement with the Cuban government for a lease for a U.S. naval
base at Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. forces would return four years
later because opposition to the elected government had turned into
open rebellion.
   American troops left Cuba again in 1909 after a new government
was elected, but returned in 1917 to protect American companies and
citizens during yet another uprising.
   Cuba's turmoil would continue through dictatorships and the rise
to power of Fidel Castro in January 1959.
   Two years later, President John F. Kennedy refused to commit
U.S. assistance to a group of Cuban exiles seeking to oust Castro
by invading at the Bay of Pigs on Cuba's south coast. The exiles
had been promised U.S. assistance and the episode proved a major
embarrassment for the Kennedy administration.
   Nineteen months later, Kennedy imposed a naval blockade of Cuba
during the 1962 missile crisis, stationing U.S. vessels off Cuba
until the Soviet Union agreed to withdraw its missiles from Cuba.

<TEXT>
   U.S. helicopter gunships and fighter
jets thundered through the hot, moonlit night toward the caldron of
light surrounding Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's headquarters.
   They whined overhead before diving toward the strongman's
compound two miles east of the Diablo Heights promontory
overlooking the Panama Canal.
   Armored personnel carriers and truckloads of soldiers roared out
of U.S. army bases on the roads below, surrounding the compound
with the crackle of machine guns, the cough of mortars and the
heavy thump of cannon.
   The sky blazed with tracer fire and, eventually, glowed with the
light of a giant fire.
   Daybreak revealed the compound reduced to rubble with only
scattered shots still being fired. A pall of acrid smoke spread
slowly over the city, as scores of dazed survivors fled their homes
in surrounding residential neighborhoods.
   Hundreds of refugees _ men, women, and children _ could be seen
in the street, walking in the tropical morning to churches,
hospitals, and schools, in search of safety.
   During the day the city turned into a scene of chaos. Armed
toughs who support Noriega took to the streets, some of them
commandeering cars. One resident said her car was stolen when a man
put a gun to her head and demanded the keys.
   Shortly before noon, the looting began. Even though sporadic
shooting continued all over the Panamanian capital, there were
dozens of people breaking into supermarkets and stores and making
off with whatever they could lay their hands on.
   Most of the looters were just poor people from the slums. Off
they went with stacks of food, cameras, home appliances, TV sets,
mattresses and clothes.
   Although a few scattered shots could be heard here and there, a
festive atmosphere reigned as people walked away with food, tires,
even refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at a
time.
   The major afternoon fighting, however, came in the San Miguelito
neighborhood to the northeast, a stronghold of the civilian
``Dignity Battalions'' that Noriega had set up to help enforce his
rule.
   Attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a Defense Forces
barracks on top of San Miguelito, and once again came the refugees,
fleeing on foot or in their cars, if they could.
   At dozens of U.S. Army checkpoints, those who wanted to pass had
to get out of their cars and drop to their knees while the vehicle
was thoroughly searched.
   U.S. soldiers herded together about 300 Panamanian prisoners in
a field near Albrook Air Base, at the foot of Diablo Heights.
Relatives and friends of the captives waited across the street.
   Many of the prisoners had been taken in raids on houses in
Diablo Heights, a Panamanian neighborhood. Jeeps with mounted
machine guns had swept through the neighborhood during the night,
stopping at certain houses and taking the men prisoner.
   In one house, where four reporters were hiding along with the
residents, the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wife
noticed an 8-by-10 color photo of her husband as a student shaking
hands with none other than Cuban President Fidel Castro.
   She swiftly hid the photo, potentially offensive to American
eyes, in their bedroom.

   Journalists' confidential sources and
information they gathered must be ``highly material and relevant,''
and unavailable from elsewhere, before reporters can be compelled
to reveal them, the state Supreme Court has ruled.
   The 5-0 ruling released Wednesday, overturned contempt citations
against two West Virginia reporters.
   In September, Circuit Judge Patrick G. Henry III held in
contempt reporters Ron Hudok of The Evening Journal of Martinsburg
and Natasha Singh of WXVA-FM in Charles Town. They had refused to
testify at a hearing about Circuit Judge Thomas Steptoe Jr.'s
decision to fire an employee.
   ``In this case, the information sought to be obtained was
tenuous at best to the main purpose of the hearing, which was to
provide (the employee) a hearing on her discharge,'' the Supreme
Court said.
   Eight news media groups, including The Associated Press and the
West Virginia Broadcasters Association, had filed a legal brief in
support of the newspaper and radio station.
   ``The decision ... is really a victory for the people of West
Virginia because it allows reporters for all media to write the
comments and viewpoints of the people who live in this state,''
said Page Burdette, editor of The Evening Journal.
   Burdette said he hopes the issue will prompt lawmakers to pass
West Virginia's first ``shield'' laws for reporters. Such
legislation would help journalists protect news sources to whom
they've promised anonymity in return for information.
   Singh said she was relieved. ``I'm just glad I get to eat turkey
at Christmas and I don't have to be in jail,'' she said.
   The opinion, written by Justice Thomas Miller, said there could
be cases when reporters' information is pertinent to a legal
proceeding. In the case of Hudok and Singh, however, First
Amendment privilege should prevail, the opinion said.
   The case stemmed from Steptoe's decision to fire Magistrate
Clerk Linda Butner in June. The judge said she publicly injected
herself into a criminal matter pending before magistrate court by
talking to reporters.
   Steptoe had sought to force the reporters to testify about their
conversations with Butner, who Henry said is bound by judicial
ethics to refrain from commenting on court matters.

   The Hispanic character who used to begin
every comedy routine ``My name, Jose Jimenez'' is being resurrected
to sell cars.
   Comedian Bill Dana, who created Jose, declared the character
``dead'' in 1969 after complaints that it was an unfavorable
stereotype.
   ``Jose has become very sophisticated over the years,'' Dana
said. ``Nowadays we call him Jose Everyman.''
   Dana has signed a contract with Cardin and Cherry, the Nashville
advertising agency whose Ernest P. Worrall character has been
played into a hit by actor Jim Varney.
   Dana has kept busy over the years as an advertising executive,
actor, scriptwriter and songwriter. Last year he appeared on David
Letterman's late-night talk show and popped up as an aged priest on
an episode of ``The Golden Girls.''
   He just completed writing his second episode for ``Matlock.''
   Dana, in Nashville on Wednesday to begin filming commercials for
a local car dealer, said viewers can expect to see many changes in
Jose 25 years after ``The Bill Dana Show'' was on network
television.
   ``The only thing he kept is his wide-eyed innocence,'' Dana said.

   Jacqueline Onassis and the Wampanoag Indians are
close to settling a dispute over a strip of Martha's Vineyard
beach-front property, attorneys for both sides said.
   An agreement over the 264-foot stretch was expected to be
reached at a hearing scheduled for Feb. 2, said Paul Sulla, a
Boston attorney for the Wampanoag. Sulla said Tuesday that he could
not discuss details he said are still being worked out.
   ``There have been negotiations but we're not quite there yet,''
said Onassis attorney Brian Hurley.
   Mrs. Onassis bought a 17 percent interest in the beach property
in 1980 from one of the 25 Wampanoag Indians. Since then she has
waged a court battle over the remaining interest in the land, which
is surrounded by her private 380-acre retreat.
   She has offered a land swap and visitation rights to the areas
the Wampanoag consider sacred. But the descendants of the island's
original settlers want to keep their share of the beach because
they say it plays an important part in their heritage.

   Former President Reagan offered his
assistance to a woman on welfare whose home was burglarized of
nearly $1,200 in Christmas gifts as she visited her cancer-stricken
daughter.
   Reagan told Blanche Griffin, 34, in a phone call while she was
at a police station Tuesday that he and his wife, Nancy, would help
her in any way they could, said police Capt. Carley Mitchell.
   Residents, police officers, firefighters and local vendors also
have rallied to the aid of Ms. Griffin.
   The woman had just returned home from visiting her 9-year-old
daughter, Vernica, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center on Monday when
she discovered the theft of gifts she said she had saved money for
all year.
   The stolen gifts included a battery-powered toy police
motorcycle, dolls and a blackboard. Also stolen were household
items and all her children's clothing.

   Singer Michael Jackson was among the hordes of
tourists who attended the Radio City Music Hall Christmas show and
shopped at a toy store this week.
   Jackson drew curious crowds and a gaggle of photographers
Tuesday as he stopped at F.A.O. Schwarz and then took in the 2 p.m.
Christmas show at Rockefeller Center.
   Leaving the Music Hall by a back entrance, Jackson tried to
remain incognito by wearing a hat, dark glasses, a scarf pulled up
over his nose and mouth, and not even one glove.
   The Daily News reported that Jackson got to meet the animals
from the Christmas spectacle backstage, and that he kissed the
camels.

awaiting the return of Howard Rollins, his co-star on the NBC
series ``In The Heat Of The Night,'' who has taken time off to
recover from an unspecified illness.
   O'Connor said Rollins is a ``vital part of the series,'' adding,
``I miss him professionally and personally and want him back on the

   Liver transplant recipient Wendy Marx was
stunned to learn Olympic track star Carl Lewis had crusaded on her
behalf for a donor.
   ``I was still in CPU (the cardiopulmonary unit) when the nurse
said, `You must be somebody special to have Carl Lewis visit
you,''' Marx recounted. ``I said, `Carl Lewis didn't visit me.' She
said, `Yes he did, and I got his autograph.' I thought she must be
crazy.''
   The Nov. 27 transplant was successful and Marx was released from
Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center to a hospital-run apartment
Wednesday.
   It was only after a donor was found through a national search
and the operation was performed on the then-comatose Marx that the
22-year-old advertising company office manager learned of Lewis'
televised appeal for a donor.
   Marx's brother, Jeffrey, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist has
been working for the past year on the athlete's autobiography.
   Marx's family was told on Thanksgiving that she had as little as
24 hours to live. In a rare reaction to hepatitis B, her immune
system had destroyed her liver.

   Rolando Diaz learned of the battle to oust Manuel Noriega when
he heard the buzz of U.S. helicopters over his neighborhood, which
then broadcast warnings to soldiers at a nearby military
headquarters to leave the building.
   ``They were shouting down over the PA system. ... They said they
had no problem with them, they just wanted Noriega,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Panama, through an interpreter.
   Then the shooting began in Panama City. Fires triggered by the
battle leveled turn-of-the century wooden homes in a three-block
area. Diaz, who escaped with 11 members of his extended family,
said he counted six bodies of those loyal to Noriega lying dead in
the streets as he and others fled the immediate area.
   Many ended up at the nearby Salvation Army office.
   ``They were carrying TVs and their belongings on their heads,''
Marjorie Wiltshire, whose husband heads the office, said in a
telephone interview.
   The Salvation Army offered refugees from the fighting cookies
and punch _ the only food available _ then began cooking lentils
and rice for a midday meal. ``That's all we have. We can't get out
to get to a store,'' Mrs. Wiltshire said.
   Diaz and his family were escorted by U.S. soldiers to a church,
where they took shelter for about five hours until the church was
hit by an incendiary device.
   ``The church also burned down,'' said Diaz, 32.
   Diaz, a clerk in the ministry of education, sought shelter along
with about 100 other people at the Salvation Army office near the
entrance to the Panama Canal. He escaped with a few extra pants and
shirts. Everything else was destroyed.
   ``They burned everything down,'' Manuel Backalt, another
civilian who fled from the area of Noriega's headquarters with his
wife and three children, said in English. ``I see plenty people
dead in the street.''
   The fires in the houses resulted from the intense fighting; they
were not targets, eyewitnesses said.
   Backalt said the bodies _ he did not know how many _ were mainly
members of the Dignity Battalion, a paramilitary group loyal to
Noriega.
   Backalt, a self-employed stove repairman, said he was sleeping
when he heard gunfire. He said his house caught fire, and he and
his family went out into the street. None of his family was injured.
   As they walked the streets, he said, they saw a helicopter
crash. He said he didn't know if it was American or a Panamanian
helicopter.
   Although he lost his home, Diaz said he was glad the U.S.
decided to attack. ``This is the best thing that could have
happened,'' he said.
   Because Noriega's headquarters was located in a slum section of
the city, most of those left homeless are poor, said Maj. Allan
Wiltshire, who runs the Salvation Army office.

<HEAD>Red Cross Official Fails to Arrange Iran-Iraq Prisoner Swap</HEAD>

   A senior Red Cross official flew to Geneva
on Wednesday after failing to arrange an immediate swap of ailing
and wounded prisoners held by Iran and Iraq more than a year after
their cease-fire.
   Angelo Gnadinger, the Middle East chief of the Geneva-based
International Committee of the Red Cross, ended his visit after
five days of talks in the Iraqi capital.
   He held similar meetings last week in Tehran with Iranian
officials, seeking the repatriation of 1,000 wounded and ailing
prisoners held by both sides.
   Gnadinger refused to comment to reporters on the outcome of his
visit before his departure.
   But Andreas Wigger, the chief Red Cross delegate in Baghdad,
said, ``I may say nothing concrete has been achieved. ... This is a
long process which needs more effort.''
   Gnadinger had hoped for an immediate release of the sick and
wounded as a first step toward settling the issue of the Iranian
and Iraqi prisoners of war under article 118 of the Third Geneva
Convention. The article calls for repatriation of POWs immediately
after hostilities cease.
   The Red Cross has registered some 50,000 prisoners held by Iran
and more than 19,500 in Iraqi camps. Many of the POWs have been
held since the early stages of the war that broke out in September
1980.
   However, diplomats and United Nations officials say the two
sides hold 100,000 POWs between them.
   Last year, Iran and Iraq released about 400 sick and wounded
prisoners. But the operation was stopped when both sides accused
the other of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum.
   Earlier this week, hopes were raised that an agreement for a
prisoner swap was imminent. Akram al-Witri, chief of the legal
department at the Iraqi Foreign Ministry, said Baghdad had
responded positively to a Red Cross call to this effect.
   But Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati quickly
reiterated the Iranian position, undermining the effort. Tehran has
insisted it will not agree to swap the prisoners or implement any
other peace move with Iraq until Iraqi troops withdraw from land
they occupied in the final weeks of the war.
   A U.N.-sponsored cease-fire halted hostilities on Aug. 20, 1988,
but peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the withdrawal
issue and Iraq's demand for a border demarcation accord that gives
it sovereignty over the entire Shatt-Al-Arab waterway.
   The channel, a confluence of the great Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, is Iraq's sole gateway to the gulf. Before the war, the
border ran down the middle of Shatt-Al-Arab.

   Members of Congress in both parties rallied
behind the president's decision to invade Panama, with most saying
he had little choice, though there were scattered objections.
   ``I support the president's decision,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who has been among Bush's harshest
critics on other foreign policy matters. ``It was made necessary by
the reckless actions of General (Manuel Antonio) Noriega.''
   There was a small core of harsh dissent, with one lawmaker
calling Bush's action ``a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy''
and saying the move rested on shaky legal ground. But for the most
part, members of Congress welcomed the restoration of a democratic
government and said all other possibilities had been exhausted.
   ``It's an action the president determined, and I think under the
circumstances Congress will support his position,'' said House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash. ``American troops are in the field
and casualties are being taken. Under these circumstances, it's not
the proper time for a lot of complicated debate.''
   Foley said he expressed ``some concerns'' when Bush called about
10 p.m. Tuesday to inform him of the impending operation. But,
Foley added, the concerns ``don't qualify my support for the
president's action.''
   The White House informed the top four leaders of the House and
Senate of the planned assault just before it was launched late
Tuesday, and contacted other key members of Congress once the
operation was under way.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior Foreign Relations Committee
member, called the action ``an overwhelming success because
democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in Panama.''
   Lugar also called the operation ``a very important moment in the
presidency of George Bush. It is a time when the president asserted
his own leadership and did so effectively.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said the action was justified.
   ``We've had a long period of provocation by Noriega,'' Hamilton
said. ``You can only go so long with this provocation, this
pushing, this harassment. He crossed over the line. It backfired on
him. I think he's a cornered tiger.''
   A rare dissent came from the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who said the threat to the
canal was less than clear and Bush did not adequately inform U.S.
allies in Central America.
   ``Personally, unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct
threat against the Panama Canal or against American people or
installations, I would not have engaged in such unilateral or such
go-it-alone action,'' Pell said.
   But, he said he would support the administration until the
operation was completed and hoped for ``as few deaths as possible''
among U.S. forces.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., harshly criticized Bush's action,
calling it ``a trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy that
continues our mindless 100-year abuse of small Central American
nations.''
   Edwards, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on the
Constitution, said Bush had violated the provision that requires
Congress' consent to go to war.
   ``There was no danger to our national security from this weak,
small country, nor was the Panama Canal in real peril,'' he said.
   However, the consensus on Capitol Hill was that Bush had
exhausted diplomatic efforts and economic pressure, and was left
with little alternative after Noriega's public declaration of war
against the United States last week.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Foreign
Relations Western Hemisphere subcommittee, said the lack of
immediate criticism from Latin American governments was testimony
to Bush's earlier diplomatic efforts through the Organization of
American States and other groups.
   ``The reaction is one of silence, and that would have to be
interpreted as benign support at this point,'' Dodd said. ``If we
end up having to be the security blanket for the new government and
you have a divided Panamanian public, then I think that support
would turn into criticism.''
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the Panama
operation erases criticism by Democrats that Bush has been ``overly
timid'' in dealing with Panama and other critical foreign policy
issues.
   ``I think what it says politically is that George Bush keeps his
own counsel and makes his own decisions,'' Dole told reporters.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, endorsed Bush's decision and praised the action as a
``blow against the international drug trade.''
   ``Manuel Noriega had explicitly declared war on us and on his
own people. He killed an unarmed U.S. citizen and had brutalized
others,'' Levin said. ``The president has protected American lives
in Panama and has struck a blow against the international drug
trade.''
   Some lawmakers expressed concern about whether the Panamanian
military could be purged of those who aided Noriega in drug
trafficking and won over to support the new government.
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said the United States should try to
freeze the millions of dollars Noriega has reportedly accumulated
as a result of his drug involvement.
   ``Noriega was like a cancer,'' said Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M., a member of the House Intelligence Committee. ``He was
making us a laughingstock, he was baiting us, he was threatening
American lives. We had no choice.''

<HEAD>Air Controllers Give 14 Facilities Low Marks for Safety</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Air traffic controllers at 14 facilities near
the East and West coasts give their operations the lowest marks for
safety and other concerns, a congressional report said Wednesday.
   The report, by the General Accounting Office, ranked controller
operations around the country according to responses from Federal
Aviation Administration controllers to an extensive 1988 survey.
The survey showed widespread concern over operations of the system
that guides all aircraft over the United States.
   A significant number of the 5,000 FAA controllers who responded
anonymously saw problems. Eighty-five percent perceived a shortage
of fully qualified controllers, 65 percent said they handled too
much traffic in peak hours, a majority were concerned about the
quality of training and 43 percent said their morale was low.
   The aggregate results of the survey had been previously
released, but the new report ranked 84 facilities according to the
percentage of employees giving negative responses on each of
several key questions.
   It says Boston and Washington FAA centers had the most negative
responses on key questions of workload, facility staffing,
overtime, training, safety and morale, while centers in
Albuquerque, Houston and Minneapolis had the fewest.
   Twelve airport facilities with the most negative responses were:
Baltimore-Washington; Boston; Burbank, Calif.; Kennedy Tower, N.Y.;
Miami; New York traffic control center; Oakland, Calif.; Ontario,
Calif., traffic control center; Orlando, Fla.; Philadelphia;
Phoenix traffic control center, and Washington National.
   Those with the fewest negative responses were Cleveland; Hebron,
Ky.; Jacksonville, Fla.; Lubbock, Texas; Milwaukee; Minneapolis;
Phoenix airport; Sacramento, Calif.; St. Louis traffic control
center; Tampa, Fla., and West Palm Beach, Fla.
   All other surveyed facilities fell into a middle category, with
a mix of negative and positive responses to the six key questions.
   ``The FAA should be asking people (at the lowest-rated centers)
why they think their center is performing so poorly,'' said Rep.
Guy Molinari, R-N.Y., who released the GAO rankings.
   Molinari, who is leaving Congress at the end of the year to
become borough president in Staten Island, N.Y., said controllers's
views should be ``key to resolving the chronic problems in the air
traffic control system.''
   He said high-ranking centers and terminals also should be
studied to see why employees rate them so well.
   Kenneth Mead, GAO director for transportation issues, said the
report has been well received by the FAA and should be a useful
tool in improving operations.
   In response to the report, the FAA said its system is safe and
improvements have been made since the survey was taken, including
an increase in the number of controllers by about 400 to 14,822 as
of Nov. 30.
   ``The GAO data is not fully consistent with results of our own
surveys which show continuing improvements in job satisfaction
areas,'' spokesman John Leyden said. The FAA surveyed employees in
1984, 1986 and 1988, he said.
   Leyden said, however, the agency would use the GAO data ``to see
if there's any new information here to help us improve the system.''

   Tennessee's secretary of state, whose
office has been at the center of a bingo and political corruption
scandal, died today, more than a week after shooting himself in the
head.
   Gentry Crowell, 57, died at Vanderbilt University Medical
Center, said hospital spokesman Wayne Hood. The one-time
legislative power broker shot himself Dec. 12 in a suicide attempt
on the front porch of his Lebanon home.
   As secretary of state, he was in charge of regulating bingo and
spending by lobbyists and political campaigns, all of which were
involved in a federal-state investigation that has resulted in 22
people being indicted or pleading guilty since January.
   Crowell testified in September and November before federal grand
juries investigating bingo corruption in Tennessee. He said he was
told by federal agents that he was not a target of the
investigation.
   Last week, however, the Nashville Banner quoted unidentified
sources as saying that federal investigaors were focusing on how
Crowell solicited campaign money from architects, engineers and
bingo operators.
   As a result of the probe one former Crowell aide, former chief
bingo inspector W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, has gone to federal prison
for offenses incliding including extorting payoffs from bingo
operators; his longtime administrative assistant and secretary,
Mary Sue Wright, has been named an unindicted co-conspirator. She
admitted taking thousands of dollars from a campaign fund.
   Controversy, much of it growing out of Crowell's passionate
devotion to the Democratic Party, followed him during most of his
18 years in state government.
   He was once known as The Godfather on Capitol Hill because of
his absolute, partisan control over legislation in the dual roles
of chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and House Calendar
Committee.
   The secretary of state's office had regulated charitable bingo
since it was legalized for charity fund-raising in 1971. In 1989
the state Supreme Court ruled bingo unconstitutional.

<TEXT>
   Britain said Wednesday it will give special
residence rights to an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong Chinese to
prevent a crippling brain drain in the colony before it reverts to
China in 1997.
   Right-wing legislators in the governing Conservative Party
threatened a parliamentary rebellion against what one called an
appalling wave of immigration. The opposition Labor Party condemned
the plan.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons that a
maximum of 50,000 key people in Hong Kong's public and private
sector would be given full British citizenship, along with their
families. He estimated the total at 225,000 people.
   Giving key people in government, business and the professions
the right to live in Britain was essential to persuade them to
remain in Hong Kong and ensure that it passes ``successfully
through the final eight years of British rule,'' he said.
   The confidence of Hong Kong's 6 million residents was ``at a low
ebb'' and the ``hemorrhage of talent'' was increasing, putting the
competitiveness of its economy at risk, Hurd said. This year,
42,000 people left and 55,000 are expected to leave next year.
   ``Many of those who are leaving would not do so if they could
obtain the assurance of right of abode in the United Kingdom,'' he
said.
   Britain therefore decided to offer full British citizenship to a
maximum 50,000 key people from many walks of life who will be
selected on a ``points system,'' Hurd said. An estimated 1,500
families of Indian descent will be included.
   ``The decisive criteria will be the value of the individual's
service to Hong Kong and the extent to which people in their
category of employment are emigrating,'' Hurd said.
   He said long service with British institutions and knowledge of
English would be taken into account.
   About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese have British passports, but
no residence rights.
   Hurd said giving all of them the right to live in Britain would
create ``unacceptable strains here'' while giving residency to just
a few wouldn't solve Hong Kong's problem and might make it worse.
   In Hong Kong, the government welcomed the package though
Governor Sir David Wilson. Several legislators said they would have
preferred full passports for all British nationals. Wilson said the
package was not ``solely for the elite'' and would help create the
stability the colony needed.
   But former Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit, the
ringleader of an estimated 50 Tory rebels, icily told the foreign
secretary he disagreed ``with almost everything you said.''
   He demanded: ``Does the pledge that we have given for the last
four general elections that there would be no further large scale
immigration still stand or not?''
   Hurd retorted the aim was to persuade key people to stay in Hong
Kong but even if many of them did emigrate, Britain would gain
professional talent and expertise from one of the world's most
successful societies.
   ``This is the last main chapter in the story of this country's
empire. I am rather keen, and I'm sure you are rather keen, that
the last chapter should not end in a shabby way,'' he said.
   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks called the decision
``appalling'' and a guaranteed vote-loser in the next election,
which must be held by June 1992.
   Fellow Conservative Tony Marlow said many people would never
forgive the government for opening the door to further immigration
in overcrowded Britain.
   ``They feel a deep resentment after a generation that imposed
immigration into this country. I believe you will not be
forgiven,'' he said.
   Labor lawmaker Diane Abbott, the first black woman elected to
Parliament, accused Marlow of holding views similar to former
Conservative legislator Enoch Powell who opposed black immigration.
   ``Speaking in Mr Marlow's words as an `imposed immigrant' and an
MP,'' she noted that ``people outside the House have listened with
mounting incredulity while elements in the Tory backbenches have
out-bid each other with sub-Powellite rhetoric on this subject.''
   She said Britain must withdraw from Hong Kong ``with honor, and
not in the shabby and shameful way some members are trying to
create an issue of an imminent yellow peril.''
   Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman called the plan
``unreasonable, unworkable, invidious and divisive.''
   Laborite Keith Vaz said the plan represented ``one law for the
rich and another for the poor.''

<HEAD>US Effort To Achieve Noriega's Departure Ended Last Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration carried out secret
contacts with a lawyer for Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega as
recently as last month in hope of persuading Noriega to step down,
the State Department said Wednesday.
   The contacts were disclosed in a State Department fact sheet
outlining U.S. diplomatic efforts to resolve Panama's political
crisis.
   The lawyer, who was not identified, told Bush administration
officials in October he was authorized to discuss Noriega's
departure. After the U.S. officials ask for a specific proposal,
the attorney promised to consult with Noriega and return in a week.
   But, last month, Noriega's lawyer advised the U.S. officials
that he had been unsuccessful in obtaining any flexibility from
Noriega and said he was under instructions to have no further
contacts with the administration, according to the fact sheet.
   In early 1988, after Noriega was indicted on drug trafficking
charges, the State Department had attempted to negotiate his
departure from Panama but he suspended the talks at the last moment
just when it seemed an agreement was within reach.
   That proposal called for Noriega to leave Panama in August 1988
and for steps toward the restoration of democratic rule.

<BYLINE>`The Face of Hunger Is The Face of the Young Child' ^By WILLIAM

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Urban hunger and homelessness rose most
rapidly this year among families with children, the nation's mayors
said Wednesday, with Boston Mayor Ray Flynn telling reporters that,
``increasingly, the face of hunger is the face of the young child.''
   He released a survey of 27 cities by the U.S. Conference of
Mayors that said many cities had so many requests for help that
they had to turn away families and others seeking shelter.
   Requests for emergency shelter were up 25 percent. Requests for
food were up 19 percent.
   One in four homeless people was a child; almost two-thirds of
those seeking food were children or their parents.
   The organization of big-city mayors based its report on a survey
of officials in 27 cities, who reported on public and private
relief efforts. The cities ranged from the nation's largest, New
York and Los Angeles, to Charleston, S.C., with a population of
81,000.
   The report found a shifting composition of the nation's urban
homeless, toward families with children.
   Families made up 36 percent of the survey cities' homeless in
1989, up from 34 percent a year ago and 27 percent in 1985. The
percentage of homeless who are single men continued to fall, from
60 percent in 1985 to 46 percent in 1989.
   Democrats cited the report, released annually by the
organization of big-city mayors, as evidence of neglect of the poor
by the Republican White House.
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Hunger, said the repoort demonstrated ``a tragic ending for the
decade'' and ``an embarrassing legacy for the present and previous
administrations.''
   Flynn, a Democrat, said increased urban misery was a consequence
of congressional inattention as well as Reagan and Bush
administration policies.
   ``It has not been the politically fashionable thing up on
Capitol Hill to help poor people,'' said Flynn, who heads the
mayors' task force on hunger and homelessness. ``I don't see how
they can turn their backs and walk away any longer.''
   The conference, which has reported rising hunger and
homelessness annually for five years, said there was a sharp
increase in the percentage of the homeless population that abused
drugs and alcohol. These accounted from 44 percent of the homeless
population, up from 34 percent last year.
   The increased requests for help were found in nearly all the
cities surveyed.
   The number of families with children requesting emergency food
assistance increased an average 14 percent, and was up in nine of
10 cities. Nearly two-thirds of the requests for food were from
children or their parents.
   The lack of affordable housing was cited as a leading cause of
both hunger and homelessness.
   Flynn said that the poor who have homes, paying increasingly
large portions of their incomes for housing, often have less money
left for food and other necessities.
   The survey said that three-fourths of the cities could not meet
all the demands for food and had to turn people away _ an average
of 17 percent of their requests.
   ``While there's a lot of things going on at the local level _
shelters, soup kitchens ... _ the problem continues to grow and
grow and grow,'' Flynn said.
   One-quarter of the requests for shelter by homeless families go
unmet, the survey found. Three out of four of the cities said
shelters must turn away homeless families because of the lack of
resources.
   On average, the study said, the composition of the cities'
homeless population is 46 percent single men, 36 percent families
with children, 14 percent single women and 4 percent young people
on their own. Blacks made up 51 percent, whites 35 percent.
   A quarter of the homeless were veterans and a quarter were
severely mentally ill.
   The Cities surveyed were Alexandria, Va.; Boston; Charleston,
S.C.; Charlotte, N.C.; Chicago; Cleveland; Denver; Kansas City,
Mo.; Los Angeles; Louisville, Ky.; Minneapolis; Nashville, Tenn.;
New Orleans; New York; Norfolk, Va.; Philadelphia; Phoenix, Ariz.;
Portland, Ore.; Providence, R.I.; St. Paul, Minn.; San Antonio,
Texas; San Diego; San Francisco; Santa Monica, Calif.; Seattle;
Trenton, N.J., and Washington.
   The cities surveyed were those whose mayors serve on the
conference's task force.

   The chief drug control strategists for the
United States and France said after a meeting Wednesday that they
will join in the fight against drugs even though they face
different kinds of problems.
   ``The drug problem in France is essentially linked to heroin,''
Georgina Dufoix said after a meeting with William J. Bennett,
director of the U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   ``Cocaine has not so far penetrated our territory as much as we
feared it would,'' she said in comments made through a translator.
   Bennett said the discussion focused on Ms. Dufoix's questions on
U.S. efforts _ ``What's going on here, what works, what we're
seeing.''
   ``She admitted France is quite concerned about its problems,''
Bennett said. ``It appears that they've been growing as the drug
criminals try to extend their reach and build their markets.''
   Bennett said he expected to continue the discussion with Ms.
Dufoix ``perhaps in France later next year.''

<HEAD>Report: Army's Toughest Measures Failed to Reduce Violence</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 7th, `Forty-three Israelis...,' to UPDATE
with 14 Palestinians wounded.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICOLAS B. TATRO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The army's tough measures of house
demolitions, deportations and school closures have failed to reduce
protests by Palestinians and at times have inflamed the two-year
uprising, according to a study published Wednesday.
   The study, part of an annual assessment of Middle East military
developments by Tel Aviv University's Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, challenged often-stated army claims that strong reprisals
served as a deterrent to unrest.
   Also on Wednesday, a military court sentenced three Palestinians
to life in prison for an Oct. 30, 1988, firebomb attack on an
Israeli bus that killed a mother and her three children as well as
a soldier who tried to rescue them. Soldiers tried to attack the
three defendants after the verdict and turned on reporters as they
left the court.
   Israel radio reported a Palestinian prisoner in the custody of
the Shin Bet secret service was found dead Tuesday night in his
cell. Arab reporters identified him as Khaled Kamel Al-Sheikh Ali,
27, of Gaza City, and said he was taken for questioning Dec. 7.
   As a new step against the uprising, the army spokesman's office
said the army would begin confiscating property of Palestinian
parents who failed to cover the bail and fines of their children.
   In Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, a leaflet signed by the
PLO-backed uprising leadership called for a general strike on Dec.
24 to mourn the deaths of the 631 Palestinians killed by Israeli
soldiers and civilians in the revolt.
   Forty-three Israelis also have been slain, and 161 other
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as alleged
collaborators with Israel.
   On Wednesday, 14 Palestinians were shot and wounded in scattered
stone-throwing clashes with Israeli soldiers in the occupied Gaza
Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   Monsignor Michel Sabbah, the Roman Catholic patriarch, called
for peace in the Holy Land in his traditional Christmas message:
   ``Peace on Earth is possible only when all people and all states
concerned recognize the legitimate rights of all individuals and
nations to freedom and self-determination.''
   The study on the uprising in the Jaffee Center's annual Middle
East Military Balance was based on army figures and conducted by
Aryeh Shalev, a retired army brigadier general who served as
military governor of the West Bank in 1976-78.
   ``What I discovered is there was no reduction in the number of
incidents,'' Shalev told a news conference. ``It means to my mind
that (such measures) didn't have a serious effect on the strength
of the intefadeh,'' uprising in Arabic.
   Since the uprising began in December 1987, army figures show 244
houses have been destroyed and 116 sealed. But Shalev said they led
to no decrease in violence as claimed by army commanders.
   ``We found no correlation whatsoever between the number of
houses demolisehd and the number of violent incidents recorded, or
the number of Israeli casualties, or even the number of petrol
bombs thrown, in the following month,'' Shalev wrote.
   In fact, his study showed, the number of incidents increased
after the heaviest periods of house demolitions. For example, 24
houses were destroyed in November 1988, and incidents of stone
throwing, barricade building and rioting rose by 1,195, or about 74
percent, to 2,790 in the following month.
   Deportation of Palestinian activists has been considered the
most severe measure against the uprising, but Shalev said it proved
impotent as a deterrent and actually inflamed the situation.
   ``There is a clear correlation between the number of residents
deported ... and an ensuing increase in the number of violent
incidents and Israeli casualties,'' he said.
   In April 1988, 16 Palestinians were deported, the largest number
in a single month, but the number of violent incidents rose by 210,
he said, adding there was a similar rise after 13 deportations in
January 1989.
   In all, 60 Palestinians were deported in the past two years.
   Shalev said closing schools initially appeared to have a
restraining effect on violence in early 1988. But he said
subsequent closures failed to have an effect and by early 1989
seemed to accelerate incidents.
   Universities have been closed since the start of the uprising.
Elementary, junior and high schools were closed in the West Bank
for eights months in 1988 and throughout the first half of 1989.
   ``I don't think it is possible to stop the intefadeh (uprising)
by using these or other means,'' Shalev told a news conference
here, adding the only solution was a negotiated political
settlement.
   Shalev suggested mass deportations and demolitions might reduce
violence but said such practice would not be possible because of
legal and moral restaints.

   The Soviet Union on Wednesday branded the U.S.
military attack in Panama ``gunboat diplomacy'' and a violation of
international law. It called for an immediate end to the operation.
   However, a Soviet official played down any impact the U.S.
action might have on improved superpower relations, and the
Kremlin's rhetoric was far milder than its denunciations of the
1983 U.S. invasion of Grenada.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfiliev told a news
briefing the sending of U.S. troops to Panama, ``whatever its
motivation, has provoked a feeling of serious concern in the Soviet
Union.''
   He said the U.S. action violated the U.N. Charter and recognized
rules of international relations and ``should be condemned by the
international community.'' The United States, he said, ``must
immediately stop its armed intervention in Panama.''
   Millions of Soviets saw dramatic footage of the attack on the
nightly TV newscast ``Vremya.''
   Commentator Igor Fyesunenko: ``Again, the world hears the loud
voice of `gunboat diplomacy' and understands perfectly well that
the anger of Washington is caused not by the American concern about
Panama, but by the wish to disrupt the process of transferrence of
the ownership rights of the (Panama) canal ... and to preserve the
complex of American military bases on the territory of this
country,'' he said.
   Tass said none of the arguments put forth by President Bush to
justify the military operation stands up to scrutiny.
   ``This action is an example of notorious `gunboat diplomacy'
which has been used for decades by the United States in an attempt
to turn Latin American and Caribbean nations into its backyard,''
the official news agency said.
   Bush said the troops were sent to protect U.S. lives and
apprehend Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who stands accused by
Washington of setting up a succession of puppet regimes while
running a military empire that purportedly trafficked in Colombian
cocaine.
   Perfiliev dismissed the allegations of drug trafficking as a
pretext to intervene in Panamanian affairs.
   The Soviet Union is steadfastly against international drug
trafficking, he said, reflecting the Soviets' greater attention
under leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to global problems that were once
dismissed as symptoms of capitalist decay.
   ``We have something else here,'' Perfiliev said. ``We are
commenting on the intervention of the United States in a sovereign
state. No matter what the motivation, this is something we are very
concerned about.''
   Despite Soviet concern, Perfiliev indicated the U.S. action
would not reverse the direction of improved Soviet-U.S. relations.
   ``We are now in a situation where an event in the East or in the
West is not perceived, is not evaluated, in terms of confrontation
between East and West,'' the Soviet spokesman said.
   But, he said, ``I think both the Soviet Union and the United
States would stand to gain if a situation could be achieved where
there is not interference in the affairs of others.''
   Tass, however, said sending U.S. troops to Panama did not
involve just another regional conflict. ``It is a dangerous
encroachment on the unsteady equilibrium that has been achieved in
the world arena,'' it said.
   The United States, it said, ``has challenged the entire
international community and is acting against universal human
interests.''
   Official Soviet reaction to the U.S. actions in Panama was
markedly more restrained than when former President Ronald Reagan
ordered the invasion of Grenada in 1983.
   At that time, the government newspaper Izvestia accused the
United States of carrying out ``a stinking show.'' It also said
Reagan was ``obsessed with the ideas of world domination.''
   Perfiliev said all countries would benefit from policies of
non-interference, which the Soviet leadership under Gorbachev has
repeatedly professed to be its policy.
   ``All states would stand to gain when all peoples of all
countries decide their own destinies,'' Perfiliev said.

   A Louisiana processor is voluntarily recalling
about 1,000 pounds of a frozen pork and rice product because it
might be contaminated with a food-poisoning organism, Listeria
monocytogenes, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Bodin Foods Inc. of New Iberia, La., sells the product through
small distributors in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and
Texas.
   It is sold frozen in vacuum-sealed plastic packages with the
name ``Boo Dan (Boudin Link) Traditional Cajun Pudding'' on the
label, and ``Est. 8214'' printed inside the USDA inspection seal on
the label.
   A USDA spokesman said the product is cooked pork and rice
wrapped in a sausage casing, or link.
   Each 10-ounce package sold in grocery stores contains two links
and is shipped 12 per carton. Ten-pound bulk packages sold to
restaurants and delicatessens contain approximately 30 links.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said consumers ``should not unwrap or taste the
product'' and should return it to where it was purchased.
   Crawford said the Centers for Disease Control confirmed the
presence of Listeria monocytogenes while investigating a case of
listeriosis, the disease caused by the organism.
   Listeriosis was described as ``a rare but potentially serious''
disease. Most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems,
including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill.
   Symptoms in adults include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms
such as fever, chills, headache, backache, and sometimes abdominal
pain and diarrhea. In newborns, symptoms include respiratory
distress, refusal to drink and vomiting.
   Consumers with question about the recall may phone the toll-free
USDA meat and poultry hotline at 1-800-535-4555 between 10 a.m. and
4 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday. Callers in the Washington, D.C.,
metropolitan area may call 447-3333.

   East Germany and West Germany have
begun a major exchange of convicted spies, government security
officials said Wednesday.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anomyity, said East
Germany has begun releasing about 25 imprisoned Westerners, some of
whom were serving life sentences.
   West Germany will release four former Communist agents in
return, they said.
   The four include two top catches of West German
counterintelligence efforts: Margret Hoeke, an ex-secretary to West
Germany's president, and Elke Falk, a former secretary in the
chancellor's offices.
   Pardons for the two women were announced earlier in the day by a
spokesman for West German President Richard von Weizsaecker. The
spokesman, Gernot Fritz, said he did not know if they had been
released from prison.
   The two women have said, however, that they don't want to be
handed over to East Germany and they won't be forced to leave West
Germany, security officials said.
   Officials did not release the names of any other agents being
released.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl met in Dresden, East Germany, on Tuesday and said there
were plans to release as many political prisoners as possible
before Christmas.
   Ms. Hoeke was convicted in 1987 of spying for East Germany and
sentenced to eight years in prison. She had worked in the offices
of several West German presidents, including Weizsaecker, before
her arrest in August 1985.
   Ms. Falk, was convicted of spying for the Soviet KGB in 1989 and
sentenced to 6{ years in prison. She had worked as a secretary in
the offices of the chancellor, the transport ministry and economic
cooperation ministry before her arrest in 1988.

   Ms. Vassilva had said she feared for her safety if she was

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger said Wednesday his
financial dealings did not violate Senate rules, but he apologized
for mistakes he made and said he would work to restore public
confidence.
   ``In retrospect, it is clear that I made mistakes and had lapses
in judgment on these matters,'' he said at the first of four news
conferences planned throughout the state Wednesday. ``I apologize
this morning to the people of Minnesota.''
   Durenberger, a Republican, said he did not intend to circumvent
Senate rules on outside income when he signed a book deal with a
Minneapolis publisher, which resulted in his earning $100,000 in
outside income over two years.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is trying to determine whether
Durenberger used the book deal to circumvent limits on senators'
income from speaking fees. The limit in 1985 was about $22,500; in
1986 it was about $30,000.
   Durenberger earlier said his appearances were to promote his two
books, ``Neither Madmen Nor Messiahs'' and ``Prescription for
Change,'' and that he cleared his activity with the Federal
Election Commission, which ruled it was allowable compensation.
   The book deal was one of three plans Durenberger had for
boosting his income when he was having financial difficulties. Two
of the arrangements are being looked at by the Ethics Committee _
the book matter and allegations that he scheduled speeches in 1985
and 1986 to coincide with appointments he and his wife had with a
marriage counselor in Boston.
   In addition, the Senate Rules Committee is looking into
Durenberger charging the Senate for rent at a Minneapolis
condominium in which he had a financial interest. Committee aides
have said their tentative conclusion was that the matter belonged
before the Ethics Committee.
   Durenberger charged the Senate for rent whenever he stayed at
the condo and collected at least $9,947 in expense payments from
the Senate for time he spent in Minnesota from July 1983 to June
1987.
   Durenberger said Wednesday he relied on advice from legal
counsel and tax experts, but said he should have paid more
attention to the details.
   The senator also said he has no intention of resigning from the
Senate and pledged to work to restore public confidence in him.

<HEAD>Iran Denies Oil Sold To Israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday
denied a U.S. report that Israel bought oil from Tehran in a bid to
free three military men believed held by pro-Iranian militants in
Lebanon, Iranian TV reported.
   The broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, quoted a Foreign Ministry
statement as saying that ``not even one barrel of oil'' had been
sold to Israel, one of revolutionary Iran's main regional foes.
   ``According to irrevocable, declared principles of the Islamic
Republic, the Oil Ministry has imposed a ban on the sale of oil and
oil-related products to Israel and the racist South African
regime,'' the statement said.
   Tehran has vowed never to establish relations with Israel and
South Africa.
   The statement added that no oil has been sold to those countries
since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled Shah Mohammed
Reza Pahlavi.
   The U.S. State Department on Tuesday confirmed an NBC-TV report
Monday that Israel bought 2 million barrels of oil worth $36
million from Iran in November to help free the three Israelis held
in Lebanon.
   Israeli representatives also have discussed the possibility of
selling Iran spare parts for its U.S.-made military hardware, NBC
said, citing unidentified sources in U.S. and Israeli intelligence.
   In addition to winning Iran's help in releasing the Israelis,
the oil purchases and the potential spare parts deal were intended
to bolster Iran's position against Iraq, their common enemy, NBC
said.
   Spokesmen for Israel's Energy, Foreign and Defense ministries
refused to comment on the report.
   NBC reported that the U.S. government had backed the oil deal in
hopes that it could help the release of eight American hostages in
Lebanon.
   They are among 18 Westerners held in Lebanon by extremist
groups. Most are captives of Iranian-backed Shiite factions.
   Iran's leaders are avowedly anti-Israeli, but the Iranian
economy, battered by 10 years of poor management and 8 years of war
against Iraq, badly needs foreign exchange for post-war
reconstruction.
   President Hashemi Rafsanjani was closely involved in clandestine
arms-for-hostages dealings with the United States and Israel in
1985-86.
   Three American hostages held in Lebanon were freed in exchange
for deliveries of U.S.-made anti-aircraft and anti-tank missile
parts.
   Rafsanjani, leader of Tehran's so-calle pragmatists, is seeking
to rebuild Iran's links with the West to end 10 years of isolation
and seek badly needed investment.
   He generally is considered to be in favor of freeing the
hostages held in Lebanon, but has limited room to maneuver because
of opposition by hard-liners led by former Interior Minister Ali
Akbar Mohtashemi, who has close ties with the Lebanese militants.

<HEAD>Queen Elizabeth Gives Preview of Christmas Message</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Queen Elizabeth II, in a preview of her annual
Christmas message, spoke optimistically of Eastern and Western
Europe living as neighbors and an unselfish world uniting to save
the planet.
   The queen broke the tradition of keeping her message secret
until Christmas day and delivered part of it to an audience of
6,000 at London's Royal Albert Hall on Tuesday night.
   Buckingham Palace confirmed Wednesday that sections of her
speech would be included in her Christmas message to the 49-nation
Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies.
   The monarch, speaking on the ``exciting'' political and social
changes in recent months, said people in both Eastern and Western
Europe have been able to think about themselves more as neighbors.
And the key to the future was learning to ``love thy neighbor as
thyself,'' she said.
   The possibility that Christ's message might at last be heeded
could make the 1990s a time for peace and cooperation to preserve
the planet from environmental threats, she said.
   ``If we can reduce dishonesty, selfishness and injustice, the
'90s might become years of peace and tranquillity, and a time to
work together for the benefit of our planet as a whole,'' the queen
said.
   ``We must be kind to it for the sake of our children and our
children's children,'' she said.
   The queen was attending a Christmas fund-raising gala for the
Save The Children charity, headed by her daughter, Princess Anne.
   ``I usually make my Christmas broadcast to the Commonwealth from
Windsor or Buckingham Palace,'' she said. ``This year I thought I
would use the presence of 2,000 children in the Royal Albert Hall
to send this special message to the children of the Commonwealth.''
   Among the children at the gala, where a cast of 700 told the
story of the Bible from creation to the birth of Christ, were two
of the queen's grandsons: Peter Philips, 12, who is Anne's son, and
Prince William, 7, son of Prince Charles and Princess Diana.

   One of 37 soldiers wounded in the U.S.
attack in Panama died after arriving today at a military hospital,
a hospital spokesman said.
   The soldier, who was not identified, died at the Air Force's
Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base, said
spokesman George Kelling.
   Kelling did not identify the soldier or disclose the nature of
the injuries.
   The soldiers arrived at Kelly Air Force Base about 11:45 a.m.
and were taken to the hospital, Airman Cynthia Fontenot said
earlier.
   She would not say how many casualties were taken to the hospital
or how serious their injuries were.
   Ray Dery, spokesman for Brooke Army Medical Center in San
Antonio, said doctors there were standing in case they were needed
at Wilford Hall.
   Officials in Washington said 11 American servicemen were killed,
one was missing and 59 wounded in the fighting. One U.S. civilian,
a woman, also was reported slain.

<TEXT>
   Romance can't be used to avoid repaying
loans to a former lover, the Iowa Supreme Court said Wednesday.
   The loans were not ``accumulated property of cohabiting
parties,'' the court said.
   ``The practical effect of denying recovery under the facts of
this case would be to permit a person to escape payment of a debt
by simply entering into a romantic relationship with the
creditor,'' the court said.
   In a Black Hawk County case, the Supreme Court reversed a lower
court order and ordered Terry Goro to repay money lent to him by
his former lover, Jerri Shold. It sent the case back to the lower
court to determine precisely how much money is owed.
   Court records said the case began in 1977 when Ms. Shold was a
student at the University of Northern Iowa and Goro one of her
teachers. They began an affair, though both were married to others
at the time.
   By 1980, Ms. Shold was divorced and court records said Goro was
anxious to obtain a divorce but pleaded financial difficulties.
   ``Jerri agreed to help,'' the court said. ``Each month Terry
would let Jerri know the amount of his financial needs and she
would give him a check for that amount.''
   The relationship continued for years and included moves together
to Minneapolis and California, and back to Cedar Falls, the court
noted.
   Finally, Goro was transferred to Detroit in 1986 and the
relationship ended, the court said.
   At that point, Ms. Shold sought repayment of the loans.
   ``Jerri acknowledges that there was no specific agreement as to
when the money would be repaid, because they did not know how long
Terry would need the money,'' the court noted.
   Simply because the two had a long-term relationship doesn't
erase the responsibility to repay a loan, the court said.
   ``Jerri's claim does not arise out of the relationship of the
parties, but from loans made to Terry,'' the court said. ``Although
the loans were intended to foster the relationship and, perhaps, to
eventually encourage a more permanent arrangement, they retained
their character as loans.
   ``They were clearly not the accumulated property of cohabiting
parties.''

<DATELINE>CARROLLTON, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A jury began deliberating the fate of
Larry Mahoney on Wednesday, after a prosecutor said ``it's time to
pay'' for the 27 deaths he allegedly caused in an alcohol-related
head-on collision with a crowded bus.
   Mahoney's lawyers said he will forever be tormented by last
year's fiery disaster on Interstate 71, but argued that the real
culprit was the builder of the bus, in which victims died of a fire
rather than the crash itself.
   Special prosecutor Paul Richwalsky said Mahoney must be held to
account for his decision to drink and drive.
   ``I know that (Mahoney) regrets it. But that's got nothing to do
with this case,'' Richwalsky said in closing arguments in Carroll
Circuit Court.
   ``The apologies ... are too late. Now it's time to pay.''
   Defense attorneys Jack Hildebrand and William Summers said Ford
Motor Co. manufactured a bus with a vulnerable fuel tank that made
it a rolling ``bomb.''
   Mahoney sobbed at times while his attorneys appealed to the jury
to free him from 82 criminal charges _ 27 counts of murder, 12 of
first-degree assault, 42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken
driving.
   Mahoney, 36, could be sentenced to 20 years to life in prison if
convicted of murder. The jury was given options of second-degree
manslaughter, five to 10 years, or reckless homicide, one to five
years, on those counts. Conviction of first-degree assault carries
a penalty of 10 to 20 years and the term is one to five years for
wanton endangerment.
   Hildebrand said Mahoney admittedly was drunk and driving on the
wrong side of I-71 when his pickup collided with the former school
bus owned by the Radcliff First Assembly of God church in Hardin
County.
   Twenty-four children and three adults died in the explosion and
fire that followed the collision. Of the 40 who escaped, 12
suffered severe burns.
   The crash occurred on May 14, 1988, a Saturday, when a church
youth group was returning home from a Cincinnati amusement park.
   Hildebrand repeated the defense's claim that Mahoney, after a
day of casual beer drinking, was tricked that night into drinking
vodka, then allowed by supposed friends to drive away.
   Mahoney could not have made a conscious decision to drive north
in the southbound lanes of I-71, exhibiting the ``extreme
indifference to human life'' that a jury must find to support a
murder or first-degree assault charge, Hildebrand said.
   Nor was it Mahoney's fault that the bus _ its chassis built by
Ford, its body by Sheller-Globe Corp. _ was susceptible to fire in
a collision, Hildebrand said.
   ``Should Larry Mahoney have known ... he was going to hit a
bomb?'' Hildebrand said. He caused the collision, but ``Larry did
not cause the fire, the explosion, the deaths, the injuries,''
Hildebrand said.
   Richwalsky said the defense theory of involuntary intoxication
and a dangerous bus was an ``attempt to mask and cover (Mahoney's)
responsibility.''
   ``Do you think if you drink all day and pour yourself behind the
wheel or your vehicle that something bad isn't going to happen?''
Richwalsky said.
   ``This was a predictable disaster,'' he said. ``Drunk drivers
going the wrong way happen every day. This time, he hit a bus.''
   Richwalsky pressed the jurors for a conviction on each murder
count.
   ``These 27 people are just as dead (as if) they had been shot or
stabbed. They're just as dead from his conduct,'' he said.
   Summers, in an emotional closing argument, said no one ``can do
anything to punish him worse'' than Mahoney already punishes
himself.
   ``Larry has the rest of his life, every waking minute, to
remember this,'' he said. ``The punishment in his heart will never,
never go away.''
   But Richwalsky said Mahoney sought to blame others _ Ford Motor
Co. and his drinking buddies.
   Richwalsky then showed the jury the identification picture on
Mahoney's driver license.
   In the picture, Mahoney wore a cap with a four-word slogan _
``Ride Hard _ Die Hard'' _ and added: ``On that Saturday night, ...
he rode hard. Those people died hard.''

   With the squeeze of a trigger, Gerald Olson
thought he could give his ailing brother the most precious
Christmas gift: a chance at good health.
   But Olson's suicide wish to offer his heart to his 56-year-old
brother could not be granted. Even if the organ were suitable,
doctors said a transplant was impossible because the heart had
stopped pumping.
   ``If it fits, and I'm pretty sure it will, as one last wish I'd
like to offer him mine, so please do your best. Thanks and Merry
Christmas,'' Olson wrote in a seven-page suicide letter found near
his body.
   Authorities say Olson, 46, drove his van Monday evening to
University Community Hospital in Tamarac, about 25 miles north of
Miami. He parked the vehicle outside the emergency room entrance
and shot himself in the mouth with a .25-caliber pistol.
   No one heard the shot, but minutes later a nurse saw Olson
slumped inside the van. A medical team tried to revive him, but he
was declared dead 19 minutes later.
   ``You can't take a non-beating heart out of a dead body and use
it,'' said hospital spokeswoman Lynne Farber. ``Heart transplants
have to be a little bit more well-planned. His brother wasn't even
in the state of Florida.''
   Olson's brother Bob is being treated with medication for an
enlarged heart and has been waiting for a transplant for three
years.
   ``Bob's got everything to live for,'' his brother wrote. ``I
figure I can do more good for him than myself.''
   Bob Olson said he was shocked by his brother's suicide.
   ``He thought of me in his last thoughts. He wanted somebody
benefiting from his death,'' he said from his home in Belvedere,
Ill. ``If he had been killed accidentally, I could have accepted
this. But to take his own life, something that is so precious to
me, I can't deal with.''
   Family members say Gerald Olson moved to Florida from Illinois
about eight years ago to stay with his sister after her husband
died of a heart attack.
   In addition to his job at a Pompano Beach tavern, Gerald Olson
helped organize fund-raising events for his brother, who made
regular trips to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
   The tavern went out of business last year, and Gerald Olson left
his sister's apartment last month after an argument. For the past
month he had been living in his van, which was cluttered with
fund-raising posters for his brother.
   In a passage of the suicide letter addressed to his daughter,
Lisa Marie, he wrote: ``I'm so sorry it had to come to this, Honey,
but lately there's been too many downs and no ups for me on this
roller coaster of life.''
   He also requested that his family be together for his funeral
and that the Mass include a tape recording of him singing ``I'll Be
Home For Christmas.''
   ``He was close to everybody, not only his family, but other
people, too,'' said another brother, Ronald Olson, 58, of Rockford,
Ill. ``Gerry's business was to like people. And if he liked you, he
loved you.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says No Major Withdrawal from Pacific Bases Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pentagon officials said Wednesday they were
not actively considering a major military withdrawal from East
Asia, although planners recently drafted a memorandum outlining
such a possibility.
   The Asahi Shimbun and Washington Post reported this week that
Pentagon officials were considering closing U.S. bases in the
Philippines and withdrawing forces from South Korea and Japan.
   That policy was outlined in a paper discussed at a meeting
Monday involving Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin
Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but many other
options also were discussed, said two Pentagon officials.
   ``There is no decision and no deadline for a decision,'' said
one of the sources. Both officials spoke on the condition he not be
further identified.
   Another source said that no such withdrawal was being considered
for the next two or three years.
   ``Our security in the Pacific is based on a robust presence,
based on agreements with as many nations as possible,'' and
therefore the United States is unlikely to close any East Asian
bases in the near future, said another official.
   The meeting among the top Pentagon brass concerned ``the future
of U.S. security interests in the Pacific. We are looking at a
number of long-term possibilities,'' said one source.
   Consideration of reducing the U.S. military presence in the
Pacific was prompted by changes in Eastern Europe and budgetary
restraints.
   ``There has been a change'' in the Soviet Bloc. ``The threat is
reduced,'' said the source.
   U.S. Pacific forces include 222,238 personnel _ 50,000 in Japan,
45,000 in Hawaii, 32,000 in South Korea, and 34,000 at sea,
according to Pentagon statistics. Additionally, the United States
operates two important bases in the Philippines.

   Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, awaiting trial
on charges he helped Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in the alleged
plunder of the Philippine government, was granted permission
Wednesday to take a vacation to Colorado and Florida.
   Khashoggi has been free on $10 million bail since he was
extradited to this country from Switzerland in July. Conditions on
his bail include that he remain in New York and that his movements
be monitored by an electronic bracelet.
   Khashoggi, who has pleaded innocent to the charges, has been
living in a luxurious Fifth Avenue penthouse. His trial with Mrs.
Marcos is scheduled to begin March 14.
   U.S. District Judge John Keenan granted his request for the
three-week vacation to visit family after Khashoggi's lawyer,
Robert Morvillo, said in a letter that federal prosecutors had
consented to it.
   According to his itinerary, Khashoggi will spend Dec. 27 to Jan.
3 at the home of his son, Mohammed, in Aspen, Colo. He then will
travel to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where he will stay at the Mariott
Harbour Beach Resort.
   Morvillo said his letter that Khashoggi would visit with his
sister, who lives in Florida.

<HEAD>Report Changes Farm Income Figures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Agriculture Department report Wednesday
showed that farmers didn't make as much money the last few years as
agency economists had been reporting.
   The Economic Research Service, the professional USDA agency that
keeps the financial books on agriculture, issued revised estimates
reflecting higher expenses than had been used in the earlier
computations.
   One of the effects was to reduce the net cash income of farmers
_ the money left over after deducting cash expenses from gross cash
proceeds during the calendar year. It includes government payments
and proceeds from crops grown in earlier years.
   The revisions, based on 1987 figures from the federal census of
agriculture, showed that net cash income in 1987 was $54.5 billion
instead of the $57.7 billion reported as recently as a month ago.
   In 1988, according to te revisions, net cash income of farmers
rose to $57.2 billion _ not the $59.9 billion stated previously.
   This year, according to the agency's new report, the net cash
income of farmers may be in the range of $52 billion to $57
billion. That is unchanged from the earlier forecast.
   Economist Greg Gajewski, who oversees preparation of the monthly
report, said that the 1987 census benchmark now being used showed
that farm expenses turn out about 3 percent higher than had been
estimated earlier.
   ``It suggests farmers did a little less well than we thought
they were doing,'' Gajewski said in a telephone interview.
   But he noted that despite the downward revisions, the new income
numbers for those years are still records and that ``the rebound
from the financial crisis is still very real.''
   The revised figures also prompted changes in another method of
farm accounting used by the agency. That involves ``net farm
income,'' which measures the value of production, including federal
payments, in a specific year. Changes in the value of crop and
livestock inventories are part of the annual accounting.
   Under this method, net farm income in 1987 was $43.5 billion
instead of the $47.1 billion reported previously. In 1988, net farm
income was revised to $42.7 billion from $45.7 billion.
   This year's estimate was pegged at $48 billion instead of in a
range of $48 billion to $53 billion used a month ago.

<HEAD>Security Council Has to Choose Between Two Panamanian Governments</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with debate delayed while Security Council

<TEXT>
   The Security Council delayed its debate on
Panama on Wednesday while trying to decide which government is
legitimate: Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's regime or the
U.S.-installed administration.
   The United States, with the help of other Western members,
stalled the council while pressing for recognition of a new U.N.
ambassador to be appointed by the fledgling Panamanian government
of Guillermo Endara.
   Endara was widely believed to have won the presidency in
Panama's national elections May 7. But Noriega, the military
leader, canceled the balloting before results were announced.
   The overnight invasion by U.S. military forces ousted Noriega
and installed Endara as president.
   Endara was expected to appoint Eduardo Vallarino, a Panamanian
businessman in self-imposed exile in the United States, as its U.N.
ambassador, said diplomats.
   Panama has no ambassador currently accredited at the United
Nations. The previous permanent representative, Leonardo Kam, was
promoted to foreign minister, and no one had taken his place.
   Noriega's government is reportedly trying to have its ambassador
to the European Community, Merla Bellavita, accredited as its U.N.
ambassador.
   The Security Council was originally to hold its emergency
meeting Wednesday morning, said officials at the Mission of
Colombia, which currently chairs the council.
   Diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said, however, that
wrangles over which Panamanian ambassador was representing the
legitimate government delayed the meeting. Council members held
meetings among themselves to decide how to proceed.
   The Security Council is faced with having to decide which
foreign minister represents Panama's legitimate government:
Noriega's appointee, Kam, or whomever Endara appoints.
   In an afternoon news conference in Washington, Secretary of
State James A. Baker III said Endara is moving to appoint
ambassadors to Washington and the United Nations.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering said the United States acted
in self--defense when it sent its military forces to Panama to oust
Noriega.
   Alejandro Serrano Caldera, the ambassador of Nicaragua, which
called for an emergency Security Council meeting, retorted that
``the United States has no legal or ethical right to intervene in
other countries' affairs.''
   Speaking in Spanish through an interpreter, Serrano Caldera said
``We want the council to call for an immediate withdrawal of the
U.S. troops.''
   Pickering told reporters outside the council that the United
States had the right to intervene under Article 51 of the U.N.
Charter, ``which provides for the use of armed force to defend a
country, to defend our interests and our people, it's the so-called
`self-defense article.'''
   Panamanian soldiers shot and killed a U.S. Marine officer at a
roadblock on Saturday night.
   Panama's declaration last week that a ``state of war'' existed
with the United States and ``the attacks on our citizens over the
weekend are several of the things which the president has cited
which required us to move in self-defense,'' Pickering said.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
ordered U.S. troops to seize Noriega and bring him to the United
States for trial on federal drug charges.
   Baker informed Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar of the
military moves by telephone at 2 a.m. Wednesday, said the U.N.
chief's spokesman, Francois Giuliani.
   Perez de Cuellar is ``extremely concerned'' about the crisis,
said Giuliani.
   Panama has repeatedly come before the Security Council to
complain of allegedly provocative U.S. military maneuvers that it
said were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple
the government.
   Panama claimed during council debates in April and August that
the United States is trying to provoke confrontations in order to
keep control of the Panama Canal.
   Under a 1977 treaty, the United States is to turn over control
of the canal to Panama at the end of 1999.

<TEXT>
   Czechoslovakia and the Soviet
Union agreed Wednesday to begin reviewing the presence of 80,000
Soviet troops stationed here since the ``Prague Spring'' reforms
were crushed in 1968.
   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and Premier Marian Calfa told
reporters after returning from a one-day visit to Moscow that a
joint commission will be set up in the first half of January.
   The commission, composed of civilian and military experts, also
will re-examine the political and historical events that led up to
the Soviet invasion and its consequences, Dienstbier said at an
airport news conference.
   Dienstbier, who has said he hopes an agreement can be reached
soon on the withdrawal of Soviet troops, told reporters the
commission would ``deal with all aspects of the Soviet military
presence'' in Czechoslovakia.
   Calfa was asked if there would soon be a timetable for a pullout
of the troops, which have been stationed in Czechoslovakia on a
``temporary'' basis for 21 years.
   ``I don't know, but I think we will have results in this area
that will satisfy the nation,'' Calfa replied without elaboration.
   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass announced that the
Soviet Union had agreed to negotiate its troop presence in
Czechoslovakia. Tass said Dienstbier and his Soviet counterpart,
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, agreed to begin the talks in the first two
weeks of next month.
   The dispatch did not say the Soviet Union would be negotiating
withdrawal of its troops, but the Czechoslovak state news agency
CTK has said the East bloc country would begin preliminary
negotiations for the pullout of Soviet troops.
   Dienstbier said he met with Shevardnadze for more than an hour
Wednesday. Calfa met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and
Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.
   Calfa said he left Moscow with the feeling that there was
``great understanding for this question.''
   Alexander Dubcek, who led the Prague Spring movement crushed by
the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, signed the
initial document allowing the troops' presence after tense
negotiations in the Kremlin, where he was flown right after the
invasion.
   Since the ouster of hard-line communist leaders the last month,
the new Czechoslovak leadership has said the agreement was invalid
because it was signed under duress.
   On Wednesday, the Communist Party apologized for its hard-line
policies of the past and for abusing its opponents after the 1968
crackdown.
   Earlier this month, the Soviet Union condemned the invasion as a
mistake. Under Gorbachev, the Kremlin has vowed not to interfere in
the affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies.
   Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria also have apologized
for their roles in the invasion.
   Dienstbier sai before the visit that any troop withdrawals must
run parallel with East-West talks on conventional weapons
reductions under way in Vienna, where a preliminary accord is
expected next year.
   Faced with a peaceful revolution, Czechoslovakia's hard-line
President Gustav Husak resigned Dec. 10 after swearing in the new
government dominated by non-communists. Other hard-line leaders
associated with the crackdown that followed the invasion have been
ousted from power and purged from the party.

   Opposition to President Nicolae Ceausescu
is centered in ethnically diverse Transylvania and in the northern
part of Moldavia, both of which have stronger historical links to
the West than the Romanian heartland that is Ceausescu's home.
   Periodic outbreaks of unrest have shaken Romania over the years,
triggered by harsh living conditions in the Balkan nation.
   In 1977, about 30,000 coal miners went on strike in the Jiu
Valley to protest Ceausescu's iron-fisted domestic policies _
policies that put an early chill on any form of organized
opposition.
   The valley is Romania's leading coal basin in rugged western
Transylvania.
   The miners demanded pay raises, more food on the shelves and
improved working conditions.
   Faced with the first big wave of opposition since he became
Communist Party leader in 1965, Ceausescu gave in to the strikers'
demands.
   Police, however, subsequently arrested and harassed hundreds of
people who took part in that work action.
   Protest leaders disappeared under mysterious circumstances in
traffic accidents.
   In November 1987, at least 10,000 workers demonstrated in Brasov
in southern Transylvania, demanding freedom, more food and
Ceausescu's ouster. The uprising was brutally put down by police
and the army.
   In the most dramatic protest faced by the 71-year-old Marxist
autocrat, hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of demonstrators were
reported to have died last weekend in unrest in Timisoara, also
part of Transylvania and 500 miles from the capital Bucharest.
Security forces randomly shot into crowds of protesters there.
   Scenic Timisoara, the city of flowers, noted for its many parks
and trees, is the capital of the Banat, a region of mixed
population containing Romanians, Hungarians, Serbs and Germans.
   It was on Timisoara's main Liberty Square that the protesters
were killed by Ceausescu's security forces.
   It was also on that square that Gheorghe Doja, leader of a
peasant uprising in 1514 and a national symbol against oppression,
died under torture.
   Like the peasants the protesters last weekend demanded freedom.
They shouted: ``Down with Ceausescu!'' ``Down with the dictator!''
and ``Today in Timisoara, tomorrow in the whole country!'' in
allusion to the spreading revolt that apparently has gripped the
country, according to witnesses.
   In the other corner of Romania, in Iasi, close to the Soviet
border, people on Wednesday were burning books by Ceausescu, Mihai
Munteanu, a member of the Soviet Congress of People's Deputies,
said in Moscow.
   Ceausescu's writings had been prominently displayed in bookstore
windows there.
   Iasi is an old cultural and historical center. French influence
was dominant there, starting in the 18th century. Many sons from
well-off families traveled to Paris to complete their education.
   They gradually formed the nucleus of an intellectual class,
which favored French philosophy and thought and became receptive to
the liberal ideas of the French Revolution and later trends.
   Hundreds of Romanian students marched in Iasi in January 1987
demanding better food and more heat in their cold dormitories.
Industrial workers held several strikes there.
   Munteanu, an ethnic Romanian who lives in Soviet Moldavia, a
former Romanian region annexed by Moscow in 1940, said he spoke
with acquaintances in Romania and was told that pro-democracy
demonstrations were going on in several cities.
   Southern Romania, historically known as Walachia, lived for five
centuries under the Ottoman Turks and has little democratic
tradition.
   The historic development of Transylvania was substantially
different and more complex.
   The province benefited from comparatively higher cultural and
political standards under the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the
empire collapsed in 1918, when Transylvania was united with the
Romanian kingdom.
   During its long experience under the Hapsburgs and Hungarians,
Transylvania became intimately associated with the events in
Central and Western Europe.
   Opportunities for travel to Vienna and cultural contacts that
developed shaped the people's political awareness.
   As Ceausescu stubbornly rejected reforms under way in the Warsaw
Pact countries, the opposition found it could now learn something
from its Marxist neighbors. By way of special TV antennas, it could
pick up Soviet, Hungarian and Yugoslav programs.
   Even in Bucharest, about 35 miles north of the Bulgarian border,
the 2 million residents can watch Bulgarian television apparently
unhindered.
   ``You can't keep Romanians isolated from the outside world, as
Ceausescu would like,'' a woman living in Iasi, six miles from the
Soviet border, said. ``It's enough to have a TV or a radio set to
be kept abreast of developments in the world.''
   ``The virus of freedom is spreading anyway,'' she told The
Associated Press.

   About 150 people outraged by the reported
massacre of demonstrators in Romania protested outside its embassy
here Wednesday, with some hurling stones and bottles of ink before
being stopped by police.
   Police otherwise did not hamper the protesters, who lighted
candles in the shape of a cross on the sidewalk outside the
embassy, hanged protest posters on its wrought-iron fence and
chanted ``Ceausescu Go Away,'' referring to Romanian Communist
ruler Nicolae Ceausescu.
   ``Romania, Rise Up,'' said one poster.
   A minute-long throwing attack by a handful of protesters left
the white embassy walls mottled by black ink. At least one window
was broken.
   The attack ended and the rally proceeded peacefully after a
policeman ordered demonstrators to behave themselves. A member of
the Polish Socialist Party gave a speech condemning Romania for
firing on its people during weekend demonstrations directed against
Ceausescu.
   In another development, the Romanian ambassador was summoned to
the Foreign Ministry to hear complaints about ``brutal treatment''
of Polish tourists by Romanian border guards, the state PAP news
agency reported.
   Poland and Romania are Warsaw Pact allies, but relations with
the hard-line communist state have been chilly since Solidarity
took over the Polish government in August.

<HEAD>Government Wins First Bill in Economic Package</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Parliament approved a farm bill with only
one dissenting vote Wednesday, indicating it will accept the entire
government plan to transform Poland's centralized economy into a
market-oriented system.
   The vote of 284-1 followed more than two days of sharp debate,
much of it critical of the government's agricultural policies, and
represented overall support for reform beyond party lines.
   Industry Minister Tadeusz Syryjczyk and the head of the Central
Planning Office, Jerzy Osiatynski, said they felt the entire
package would be approved. A finance official said a letter of
intent on an International Monetary Fund agreement would be signed
with the IMF soon.
   The Soviet bloc's first non-Communist government, led by
Solidarity, is pushing economic reform in an effort to conquer
annual inflation of 900 percent a burdensome $39 billion foreign
debt and qualify for desperately needed Western economic aid.
   Officials acknowledge the program, which takes controls off
prices, ends most subsidies and limits wage increases and will be
painful in the beginning. It is expected to cause a 20 percent drop
in real incomes and put 400,000 people out of work in a nation
unaccustomed to unemployment.
   Before Wednesday's vote, Bronislaw Geremek, the Solidarity
leader in Parliament, said in urging support for the farm
resolution: ``We are convinced that Polish farmers ... will be able
to understand the interests of the state.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki and the architect of economic
reform, Deputy Premier Leszek Balcerowicz, sat side by side in the
chamber as the vote was taken.
   By Wednesday, three days after Balcerowicz presented the
economic plan to Parliament, the government appeared increasingly
confident of passage.
   Osiatynski, head the planning office, said: ``I think it will be
voted in before the first of January. The difficulties will start
only once it is voted in and once we start carrying it out.''
   Janusz Sawicki, deputy finance minister, said Poland would sign
a letter of intent with the IMF ``within the upcoming few days.''
   After the letter is signed, Sawicki said, he expects the IMF to
announce preliminary acceptance of Poland's economic reform program.
   He said that would allow Poland to get a $215 million bridge
loan from the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland and
release a $1 billion loan pledged by a group of Western countries,
led by the United States and West Germany, to support turning the
zloty into a convertible currency.
   The IMF is expected to ratify the agreement at the end of
January or early February, Sawicki said. In it, Poland agrees to
continue a strict regimen of reform in exchange for a $700 million
line of credit from the IMF.
   Certification by the IMF would open the way to money from other
Western lenders, including a World Bank loan of $300 million, and
rescheduling of Poland's $40 billion hard-currency debt.

   Romania declared a state of emergency
Wednesday in the western region around Timisoara, where security
forces may have killed thousands of people in crushing
anti-government protests.
   Tens of thousands marched through the city to demand the bodies
of protesters, chanting ``Give us our dead!''
   Reports said protests of President Nicolae Ceausescu's iron rule
had spread to at least eight more cities since the bloody weekend
at Timisoara, which is in Transylvania only 30 miles from the
Yugoslav and Hungarian borders and about 500 miles from the capital
Bucharest.
   Ceausescu, the last autocrat in the Soviet bloc, declared the
emergency hours after returning from a three-day state visit to
Iran, Romanian state radio reported.
   It said an 11 p.m. curfew in the city of 350,000 and surrounding
region applied to everyone except workers on factory night shifts
and banned gatherings of five or more people.
   Soldiers, police and members of special militias were placed on
alert, the radio said, without specifying what that meant.
   In a broadcast speech earlier, Ceausescu ignored international
condemnation and said fascists and foreigners were fomenting unrest
in his Stalinist land.
   He said soldiers fired warning shots Sunday in Timisoara when
threatened by ``hooligan elements,'' but did not mention casualties.
   ``The military units ... were compelled to defend themselves,''
he said, but were ``very patient'' and ``did not respond, even when
soldiers and officers were hit.''
   Few foreigners and no journalists could get into Romania.
Reporters already there, including those from allied nations, were
not allowed to travel freely.
   Eastern European reporters who tried to reach Timisoara from
Bucharest were turned back 30 miles away, the Soviet, Yugoslav and
East German news agencies reported.
   Timisoara remained inaccessible to foreign travelers and
telephone callers Wednesday. It also was impossible to telephone
Bucharest from Vienna.
   A Yugoslav trucker said he saw graffiti daubed on walls in a
Timisoara suburb early Wednesday, calling for ``an uprising ...
against the Ceausescu regime on Dec. 24.'' He reported sporadic
gunfire and from the direction of downtown Timisoara.
   A Pole who reached Budapest, Hungary, from Timisoara on
Wednesday told the daily Mai Nap it was ``like a city under siege.
I saw them tossing dead into the river. People told me over 1,000
people were killed.''
   Dispatches from the Yugoslav and Hungarian news agencies said
Timisoara was full of police and soldiers Wednesday, but that
50,000 people went into the streets nonetheless. Western
businessmen who crossed into Yugoslavia said Wednesday's protest
began at a factory in the morning.
   The businessmen said the people went to a stadium where they
apparently believed authorities were keeping the bodies, chanting
``Give us our dead!''
   No police intervention was reported by the businessmen or the
Yugoslav news agency Tanjug, which quoted the Yugoslav consul
general in Timisoara. MTI, the Hungarian news agency, said some
soldiers joined the demonstrators in chanting slogans against
Ceausescu.
   In a dispatch quoting Romanians working in East Germany, the
official East German agency ADN said unrest had spread to at least
eight other Romanian cities and the death toll in Timisoara could
reach 3,000 or 4,000.
   Casualty estimates have risen daily since Sunday. No independent
confirmation is possible because of Romania's isolation.
   Large numbers of soldiers and police were reported in the
streets of Bucharest and other major cities, according to a
Hungarian who telephoned five cities, and dispatches from Eastern
European journalists in the Romanian capital.
   Mihnea Berindei, Paris spokesman for a group called Defense of
Human Rights in Romania, said some policemen entered hospitals to
arrest wounded protesters. Belgrade radio said police burst into
the Yugoslav consulate, the only diplomatic building in Timisoara,
and seized demonstrators who took refuge there.
   Yugoslavia's Foreign Ministry would not confirm or deny the
incident, which would be a violation of diplomatic conventions.
   In a report from the Yugoslav border with Romania, Tanjug said
there was no more room in Timisoara hospitals.
   The Hungarian Red Cross appealed for international help in
searching for victims of the crackdown.
   Ceausescu, who has ruled Romania since 1965, delivered a
25-minute broadcast address after his return home, with his entire
government and wife Elena, the second most powerful person in
Romania, lined up behind him.
   He sought to blame Hungary, which he has accused of wanting to
reclaim Transylvania, where most of Romania's 1.7 million ethnic
Hungarians live. Hungary ruled the region for centuries, but it was
given to Romania in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon.
   Foreign Minister Gyula Horn said earlier that Hungary was not
involved in the unrest.
   In his speech, the 71-year-old Romanian leader blamed the
trouble on fascists cooperating with ``reactionary, imperialist
circles and espionage centers.''
   ``The aim of these anti-national, provocative actions was to
provoke disorder and to create the conditions for the territoral
dismemberment of Romania, of its independence and sovereignty,'' he
declared.
   Ceausescu has governed with increasing harshness in recent
years. He has ignored international criticism of his human rights
policies and enforcing industrialization and debt repayment
programs that caused rationing and other hardships.
   Because none of his remarks dealt with those problems, which
have created widespread discontent, it appears he will continue to
rely on the army and legions of uniformed and secret police to
perpetuate his regime.
   Tanjug reported from Bucharest, quoting unofficial sources, that
``a state of full alert has been introduced across Romania as
protests and unrest continue in Timisoara and other towns.''
   ADN said unrest had spread to the other Transylvanian cities of
Brasov, scene of a large anti-government protest in 1987; Cluj, and
Sibiu, to the Black Sea port of Constanta and at least four other
cities.

   The former head of the U.S. Southern Command
in Panama, said Wednesday that the military strike against Panama
was ``well-planned and well-executed'' even though he has long
opposed the use of force there.
   Retired Gen. Fred Woerner, who left the Southern Command on
Sept. 30, also said the operation would be judged ``a disaster, an
absolute catastrophe'' if Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega returns to
power.
   Woerner had opposed military intervention in Panama, advocating
diplomatic and other peaceful options to dislodge Noriega. The
Panamanian leader has been indicted on drug charges in the United
States.
   Various U.S. administrations failed to deal successfully with
Noriega, ultimately pushing President Bush into a corner where he
could do nothing except send in the military, Woerner said.
   ``Bush had no other options. It had reached a point where an
American was killed,'' he said.
   Woerner, in a telephone interview from San Jose, Calif., said
Bush called for the military strike to protect the lives of
Americans and ensure freedom of movement in the Panama Canal.
   Although he did not have inside knowledge of the military
operation, Woerner said it appeared from news reports that it was
handled professionally and competently.
   ``The military operation looked well-planned and
well-executed,'' Woerner said, adding, however, that it apparently
took longer than expected.
   Woerner described Noriega as ``a clever, clever guy.'' The U.S.
operation won't be considered successful unless Noriega is either
captured or driven from Panama and never returns, Woerner said.
   He said he did not think Bush would call off the operation until
it was certain that Noriega could never return to Panama.

   Bomb-sniffing dogs and squadrons of
police provided tight security Wednesday as a crowd of mourners
paid their respects to a federal appeals judge killed by the first
in a series of mail bombs.
   St. Luke's Episcopal Church was filled to overflowing with more
than 700 people who were asked to put aside their anger over the
slaying long enough to remember the contributions of U.S. Circuit
Judge Robert Vance.
   Dogs searched the church before the service, and dozens of
officers kept watch during the 35-minute program of scripture,
hymns and a eulogy.
   Vance, a member of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court and a former
chairman of the Alabama Democratic Party, was killed instantly last
Saturday when the bomb exploded in his home, propelling nails into
his lower abdomen. His wife, Helen, was injured in the bombing and
remained hospitalized Wednesday.
   A similar bomb two days later killed a civil rights lawyer in
Savannah, Ga., City Alderman Robert Robinson. A package bomb was
found in the Atlanta courthouse including the 11th Circuit on
Monday and a fourth mailed bomb was removed Tuesday from the NAACP
headquarters in Jacksonville, Fla.
   All four targets can be linked to school desegregation efforts
by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
leading investigators to speculate that a white racist group may be
responsible.
   Four anonymous letters mailed in August to declare war on
various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the
bombings, FBI spokesman Greg Jones said Wednesday in Washington.
   The bombs and threats has prompted the NAACP to boost security
at its offices, executive director Benjamin Hooks said Wednesday at
the organization's national headquarters in Baltimore.
   Hooks said he's convinced the bombs were the work of white
supremacists who feel threatened by recent victories for blacks in
courtrooms and at the polls.
   ``I think it's the work of white supremacists, without any
question. I think it reveals the derangement, demented, criminally
stupid minds,'' he said.
   Leaders of the Ku Klux Klan are denying any involvement.
   ``There ain't nobody in any white supremacist group got sense
enough to make a bomb,'' said Daniel B. Carver, Georgia grand
dragon of the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. ``I'm
hoping if it's one of those big drug dealers, maybe they'll take
credit for it and get the FBI off our backs.''
   Carver was one of several defendants who had appealed a $950,000
jury verdict against two Klan groups for pelting civil rights
marchers with rocks and bottles in Forsyth County. The 11th Circuit
refused in October to rehear the defendants' appeal.
   At Vance's service, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Clifford Fulford of
Birmingham, a close friend of Vance, delivered the eulogy, asking
the mourners to ``put aside our outrage for awhile'' to honor Vance.
   ``The assassins were cheated if they thought that Bob Vance was
afraid to die,'' Fulford said. He described the 58-year-old Vance
as a strong believer in the law and a man ``who stood up for the
underdog and the oppressed.''
   ``No wonder his assassins could not stand such a man in their
presence.''
   Friends of the Vance family said his remains have been cremated
and his ashes will be placed in the church.
   Because of the rash of bombs, and the attendance of public
officials, the church, south of Birmingham, was surrounded by
police barriers and cordoned off with yellow tape.
   Among those who attended the service were Sessions, Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh, Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, the
justice who oversees the operations of the 11th Circuit, which
handles appeals from Floria, Georgia and Alabama.

   The Smithsonian Institution reported Wednesday
that 11 scientists and technicians associated with the its Tropical
Research Institute in Panama are missing and are believed to have
been abducted.
   ``These people have disappeared, and we're very concerned,''
said Smithsonian spokeswoman Madeleine Jacobs. ``We have every
reason to believe they were taken hostage.''
   Ms. Jacobs said the scientists, five Americans, five Panamanians
and one Venezuelan, were working at a marine research facility on
the Sanblas chain of islands off the Panamanian coast in the
Caribbean when they were abducted by armed troops.
   A Smithsonian employee on the island called the research
institute's director in Panama City at midmorning by radio
telephone to warn that the troops were approaching in a boat. A
couple of hours later, a technician on the island called briefly to
say they were being transferred to the mainland and taken by truck
to an unknown destination.
   Ms. Jacobs said most of the 190 other Smithsonian employees and
visiting scientists in Panama had been accounted for.

   Here is the transcript of a Pentagon briefing
on the Panama situation conducted Thursday afternoon.
   PETE WILLIAMS (Defense Department Spokesman): Good afternoon,
ladies and gentlemen. We have an update for you on the situation in
Panama. And here to speak to you are two experts. The person who
will answer most of your questions is Gen. Tom Kelly, who is the
Director of Operations for the Joint Staff. And also with him is
Admiral Ted Sheafer, also of the Joint Staff, whom many of you have
met before.
   I know you have a lot of questions. Our main purpose here today
is to update you on the situation on the ground in Panama. Gen.
Kelly has been following this moment by moment since it began last
night. So he is very familiar with the details and has been at it
the whole time. And we'll go for about half an hour or so.
   General?
   GEN. KELLY: It's very nice to be here, and I appreciate the
opportunity. What I would like to do is show you what our forces in
Panama have done during the day. The Chairman briefed you this
morning on the point at which we had arrived then. Operations have
continued; they have gone fairly well for us.
   We'll start out here in Rio Hato where the two infantry
companies were. You might recall that the infantry companies were
instrumental in putting down the coup on the third of October,
therefore they were considered to be very loyal. The Rangers went
in, took them out; that's been completed. They took their arms
room. They got 250 prisoners, roughly. The rest fled.
   And that's a problem we're having in a lot of areas, in that
much of the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) is fleeing in the face
of the U.S. military units. That presents us with a dilemma: Are
they, in point of fact, going to go into the jungle or the woods
and represent a force in the field? Or are they going to resolve on
a life of crime and use their weapons to just raid the people? Are
they going to lay their weapons down and go back and try and get a
job and participate in the hoped for economic prosperity? We don't
know that. That's one of the things we've got to be watching and
one of the things we have to do.
   Over here in the Task Force Semper Fi area everything is pretty
quiet. All of the PDF resistance within that area has been reduced.
As you may recall; there was never very much in the first place,
although I can't guarantee you again, because this is a big open
area with a lot of vegetation, that there aren't some people out
there.
   Let me just sneak out here a little bit. (Moves toward map.)
   Up in the Task Force Atlantic area, everything up there has been
reduced. First, the 8th Company elected not to fight very much in
the first place, and the naval infantry company, which did fight,
has been reduced. Therefore, the situation is calm up there. We
used one battalion to do that, and as you may recall, another
battalion came down into this area, Punta Gamboa, where there's a
housing area and a prison, and protected the housing area and
unprotected the prison; went to Cerro Tigre, where there's an
electrical distribution grid, and secured it; and went to Madden
Dam, possibly the most chief facility along the canal, because as
you know, that's the water that's used to fill the locks that make
the canal functional. If we lost that and the dam had to be
rebuilt, I've seen estimates where it could take a year or longer
to fill back up.

<HEAD>WASHN: back up.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: General, can you try and talk into the microphones?
   GEN. KELLY: Yeah, sure. I'm sorry. Why don't you move that map
back a little? The map is my security symbol and my lesson plan.
   Of interest is that the Canal is functional. There has been no
endeavor that we've uncovered to try to destroy it. We have forces
out along it, and we intend to protect it. It was actually worked
somewhat today. Some ships were moved out. And we are hoping as
early as tomorrow we'll be moving other ships through the canal, so
that's a real plus for the effort to date.
   I would say things up in the Task Force Atlantic area are in
pretty good shape.
   We'll skip Task Force Bayonet now and go out to what we're
calling Task Force Pacific, and that's the one that's built around
the 82nd Airborne Brigade, which jumped in last night. They have
gotten organized, moved out. They have attacked the cav squadron at
Panama, Viejo, or engaged the cavalry squadron, and reduced it;
there is no longer any resistance there. They have engaged the
infantry company at Finajitas and reduced it; there is no
resistance there. They have engaged the Battalion 2000, another
anti-coup unit from the 3rd of October, and found nothing when they
got there.
   Actually an R&amp;S team out along the bridge on the Pacora River
last night called in airplanes, AC-130s, and they knocked out nine
of their vehicles, which I think is a pretty good portion of their
vehicles. And the rest fled.
   And we've been seeing the PDF fleeing from our troops in most of
the engagements, with some exceptions: the naval infantry up here,
at least initially the two companies at Rio Hato, although
eventually they fled. So it looks like the organized resistance in
these areas is pretty much a thing of the past.
   The organized resistance in the Task Force Bayonet area is also
a thing of the past. We were going into the Comandancia this
afternoon with a Ranger company to go through it room by room, and
we found it empty. We have completed sweeping all of the buildings
at Fort Amador, and Fort Amador is now secure, although there is
some shooting down in this area. We have established a refugee
collecting point at Balboa, and as of mid-afternoon, had about
1,000 people in there. And refugees are becoming a problem.
   But I think it's fair to say that the _ and our plan was to go
after the organized combat forces of thePDF first in this area from
Rio Hato on out to Fort Cimarron _ Rio Hato in the West, Fort
Cimarron in the East. That's where the preponderance of them are.
   That's where the preponderance of the power of the PDF is. We
went after them first. We have reduced them. And there is no
organized resistance left in those areas, although there are people
left in those areas. There are also a number of Dignity Battalions
in those areas, primarily in Panama City, and that has got to be
our next priority, to get in there and to begin to clean that out.
   Panama City, as you know, is a city of almost a million people.
Urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind. They might
compete with the relief in place in the dark, but they're right up
there in the degree of difficulty in terms of military operations.
   It's a large city to sweep through. It's going to take a lot of
people. That's why we are anxious to get the 7th Infantry Division
brigade in tonight and anxious to get the 16th MP Brigade
Headquarters and those two companies in.
   Two companies doesn't sound like much, but that goes _ they go
with the other MP companies already in Panama. I believe there's
five of them. So it'll represent about a brigade of MPs.

<HEAD>Historical Instrument Group Evolved From One Man's Birthday Parties</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHY EYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   People who march to a different
philosophical drummer in Mississippi can find liberal camaraderie
to the beat of such old instruments as sacbuts, lutes, krummhorns,
cornettos and viola da gambas.
   The Mississippi Academy of Ancient Music Inc. brings in groups
reviving the old inmstruments and period music, providing social
gatherings for many who may not feel comfortable at traditional
Southern black-tie affairs, Academy President Rich McGinnis says.
   The academy formed in 1981, evolving from elaborate Thanksgiving
weekend birthday parties for the late civil rights activist Ernst
Borinski.
   ``It was kind of the one place where liberal Jackson could
meet,'' said McGinnis, a Tougaloo College chemistry professor, of
the Borinski parties.
   Borinski, who died in 1983, was a Polish-German Jew who fled
from Nazi Germany to the United States in 1938 and had taught
sociology at Jackson's historically black Tougaloo College since
1947.
   He is credited with initiating many academic forums across the
state during the 1950s and 1960s where both blacks and whites met
to discuss civil rights issues. The former German judge also served
as undergraduate mentor for a large number of black lawyers
including Reuben Anderson, Mississippi's only black Supreme Court
justice since Reconstruction and the first black to graduate from
the University of Mississippi Law School.
   ``Borinski would always have a birthday party just after
Thanksgiving. It was in a very European style,'' McGinnis recalls.
``He would have a little party for his friends from the college and
so forth, other friends from Jackson. In fact, actually it was a
lot of civil rights people. ...
   ``One time he was at an ACLU auction and he bought an evening of
music from Jean Paul, the St. Andrews (Episcopal) choir master.
Jean Paul wanted to play `Shadow of Your Smile' or something like
that all night on the piano _ but here's a college professor, so he
figures he'd better do something serious. So he brought some music
over that they were doing at St. Andrews.''
   Borinski liked the very old music which Jean Paul played and a
month before his next birthday, he told McGinnis he'd like to have
a similar performance again. McGinnis called on Max Garriott, a
tour guide and professional musician in Vicksburg who is now vice
president of the Mississippi Academy of Ancient Music.
   ``I knew Max had composed some Baroque-style music for parties.
So he wound up composing special birthday music for Borinski _ some
of it adapted from Baroque music and some of it original,''
McGinnis said.
   The parties grew, with 250 to 300 people at Borinski's 80th
birthday in 1981, he said.
   The birthday parties were ``one of the crazy things that led
into all this,'' he said.
   ``And it kind of kept that little group of people together'' who
now support the ancient music academy.
   McGinnis and Garriott said their group is now funded by various
grants from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Mississippi
Arts Commission and other public and private sources. It is host to
performances by about four professional groups each year, with
audiences averaging about 200.
   Most of the performers come from Europe because it is in the
forefront of the growing revival of historically authentic
performances on period instruments, McGinnis said. Jackson is often
the groups' only Southern stop on their American tours.
   ``We present music from 1200 to 1800 _ 600 years worth of music.
And if you go to one concert and don't like it, or if you do like
it, it doesn't mean you'll react the same way to the next one,
which may be completely different music,'' McGinnis says.

   The Communist Party apologized
Wednesday for its hard-line policies of the past and for its abuse
of opponents after the 1968 crackdown on reform. Its leader said
the once omnipotent party is nearly bankrupt.
   At a key party congress, the party also elected to leadership
roles two men distinguished by their acceptance of the opposition,
including Ladislav Adamec, who initiated official negotiations with
opposition leader Vaclav Havel.
   Adamec, the former premier, was chosen party chairman. Vasil
Mohorita, former chairman of the Communist youth group and another
main figure in talks with the opposition, was elected first
secretary.
   The apology was the first of its kind to the Czechoslovak
people, who in the last month have come together in a peaceful
revolution that ended the Communists' monopoly on power.
   ``The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia apologizes to the
Czechoslovak people for its past policies,'' said Evzen Prusa, a
top party official who spoke on national television on the first
day of a the congress.
   ``It also apologizes for the events following 1968 and for
expelling and harassing the innocent,'' Prusa said.
   All the leaders installed after the crushing of the 1968
``Prague Spring'' reforms have been ousted from power the past
month, and the party recently condemned the Soviet-led invasion
that ended the Prague Spring.
   The party now is maneuvering to try to make the best showing
possible in free elections expected by July.
   In his opening address to the congress, party chief Karel
Urbanek lashed out at former and present party leaders for
``serious'' political mistakes that he said caused the party's fall
from power.
   Urbanek said that as a member of the ruling Politburo, he also
was to blame for allowing hated hard-liners to remain in the top
ranks.
   Urbanek said the ``party leadership manifested negligence and
irresponsibility worthy of punishment'' for not ousting officials
such as former Prague party boss Miroslav Stepan and others sooner.
   Stepan and former party boss Milos Jakes were accused of being
politically responsible for a brutal police crackdown on peaceful
student demonstrations Nov. 17 that ignited the popular revolution.
   Leaving Stepan on the Politburo was ``an extraordinary,
politically serious mistake,'' Urbanek said.
   Stepan and Jakes have since been forced from power.
   They denied accusations by a parliamentary commission that they
were responsible for the November brutality.
   Urbanek said the party faces bankruptcy, disclosing that party
dues were used to build recreation facilties for top brass ``about
which the rank-and-file only learned today.''
   Detailing the crisis facing the party, Urbanek noted that it had
lost 66,290 of its 1.7 million members in the last month.
   About 1,000 new members have joined, including 143 people purged
from the party after the 1968 invasion who were recently
rehabilitated, he said.
   The speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds
itself following the triumphs of the pro-democracy movement.
   ``I'm aware things won't be easy in the future,'' Adamec told
the delegates in his acceptance speech, adding that he took the job
out of a feeling of responsibility to correct past mistakes.
   Adamec resigned as premier this month after failing to form a
government acceptable to the opposition.
   As party chairman, he is responsible for external party policy,
including dealing with other political forces. Mohorita, the first
secretary, handles internal policy and administration.
   Lubos Belka, representing the reform Communist Democratic Forum
at the congress, asked party leaders to renounce their privileges
``so Communists can regain the lost trust of the nation.''
   ``Communists must no longer work in velvet chairs, but must
return to where they came from,'' he said.
   It was not known how many delegates at the congress support the
reform movement.
   But a spokesman for Democratic Forum indicated during a news
conference that the congress seemed about evenly split between
hard-liners and reformers.
   About 40 delegates from the reformist group were invited to
attend the congress as non-voting guests.
   Democratic Forum spokesman Rudolf Prevratil told the official
CTK news agency his group was not allowed to participate in
discussions and charged they had been invited to give the
impression of democracy within the party.
   Also among the non-voting guests were former party members
expelled in the wake of the 1968 invasion.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West
Germany recommended Wednesday that East Germany become stronger
economically before considering reunion with its rich and powerful
neighbor.
   At the end of an emotional visit to the East, he also discounted
fears of a ``Fourth Reich,'' an increasingly used term that raises
the specter of Adolf Hitler.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France, who arrived in East
Berlin for a three-day official visit hours after Kohl returned to
the West, cautioned against changing borders in Europe.
   ``For the whole of Europe, it would not be good _ indeed it
would be very dangerous _ to reopen the issue of the existing
borders,'' he said.
   Before returning to Bonn, Kohl said ``the economic potential of
the German Democratic Republic must be strengthened'' before
reunification became a possibility. He said he expected a treaty
expanding relations to be completed before East Germany's first
free elections, scheduled for May 6.
   Mitterrand, in an interview with East German TV before leaving
Paris, said relations between the two German states have ``very
special characteristics.''
   He was the first head of state or government of the three
western World War II Allies to visit East Berlin. Aides said his
trip should not be viewed as recognition of East Berlin as the East
German capital, which the Western Allies reject.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France and Britain still have
authority over Berlin as a result of postwar occupation of Hitler's
Third Reich.
   Kohl, who spent two days in East Germany, said at a final news
conference his government would address the concerns of other
European countries as the two Germanys move closer together.
   ``It's the most natural thing that Germans want to live
together, but we all know it cannot come immediately,'' he said.
   East Germany's parliament scheduled a session for Jan. 11-12 to
debate a new travel law and legislation to promote joint ventures
with Western companies.
   A draft law providing alternatives to military service for
conscientious objectors also will be on the agenda, the official
news agency ADN reported.
   Bild, a West German newspaper, said another passage through the
Berlin Wall would be opened Friday at the historic Brandenburg
Gate, a symbol of German unity.
   Kohl and Premier Hans Modrow agreed at their summit Tuesday that
East Germany woulds open a pedestrian crossing at the gate before
Christmas and would lift travel restrictions for West Germans on
Christmas Eve.
   They also signed several agreements and pledged to negotiate a
treaty bringing them closer together, especially by expanding
economic links.
   In a commentary Wednesday, ADN said the summit was a success,
but ``anyone who hoped'' Kohl would arrive ``with a sack full of
Rhine gold rejoiced too early.''
   Kohl told reporters inter-German issues that could be discussed
soon included improving traffic connections and solving joint
telecommunications and pollution problems.
   ``We will have to work intensively'' on a common German
currency, he said, and acknowledged that as ``one of the most
difficult questions.''
   Kohl said the aim of a common currency was to allow West Germans
to buy goods in East Germany. East Germany restricts such purchases
because state subsidies make many goods much cheaper than in West
Germany, and shortages are feared.
   In a sign of the rapidly increasing economic links, East Germany
announced Wednesday the first joint venture with a West German firm
had been signed. A compact disc manufacturing plant is to be built
by the Pilz company, based outside Munich, and the East German
state conglomerate Robotron.
   In Bonn, a working group of both nations on promoting tourism
held its first meeting.
   Kohl said West Germany will support reform in East Germany and
``not only talk, but act.'' He pledged, however, to avoid
``destabilization,'' an apparent reference to the power vacuum
created by the collapse of Communist Party control over the past
two months.
   Addressing the concerns of neighboring countries, Kohl said:
``Fears based in the past are understandable, but there is nothing
to be feared from the future. It's absurd to talk about a Fourth
Reich.''

<HEAD>Two-day Arab, EC Meeting Opens Thursday</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A two-day conference of foreign ministers of the
European Community and the Arab League gets underway Thursday
despite misgivings discreetly expressed by the United States.
   The initiative for the unprecedented meeting came from French
President Francois Mitterrand, current chairman of the 12-nation
European Community, to give a new impetus to the EC's exchanges
with the Arab world.
   But the United States has taken a critical view of the idea,
conference sources reported, because it would exaggerate the
importance of the EC, which is preparing to create a single
European market among the 12 by 1992.
   Furthermore, the Americans dislike the idea of Libya, Syria and
the Palestine Liberation Organization _ with which the United
States has no trade relations _ participating fully and dealing on
equal basis with the members of the European Community, said the
sources, who asked to remain anonymous.
   They said Britain and some Arab countries close to the United
States _notably Saudi Arabia _ dragged their feet on taking part in
the meeting because of the American misgivings.
   But all 12 members of the Community and the 22 members of the
Arab League finally decided to participate for fear of being
isolated within their groups.
   In Washington, the State Department had no immediate comment on
the conference, said spokesman Adam Shubb.
   Libya was seen as the most reluctant Arab participant because of
France's military intervention on behalf of the government of Chad
against Libyan-backed rebels, as well as the French decision to
renew the ban on shipment of French-made arms to Libya.
   The government of Col. Moammar Gadhafi decided to participate
``only at the urgent request of its Arab brothers,'' Libya's
official JANA news agency said.
   The first steps to creating an ``Arab-European dialogue'' were
taken in 1973 when the oil crisis had brought the Arab states to
the high point of their power. The earlier attempt collapsed
largely because of political problems, including accusations of
terrorism against Libya and Syria.
   For the current conference, the French government has reoriented
the agenda more toward economic matters.
   France is concentrating on a selected list of specific to avoid
getting bogged down in political subjects, such as the PLO's
decision to challenge the export of citrus fruit from the
Israeli-occupied territories to Europe.
   The agenda includes such items as agreements on trade in
petrochemicals, the exchange of consulting engineers, an
Arab-European financial convention, European aid to the North
African railroad network and preparatory work for the proposed
fixed link _ by tunnel or bridge _ across the Strait of Gibraltar.

   And then the command-and-control capability that the brigade
headquarters gives us should give us an ability to thicken the
forces in the vicinity of Panama City, and to get in there tomorrow
and do some good work.
   I would point out to you that most of the paratroopers, and most
of the soldiers and the Rangers who went into Panama, have at this
point been awake for three days, and they're pretty tired. You
know, they marshal the troops a good 18 hours before they get on
the airplane.
   They fly down, which is not a lot of fun because we tend to
fully book the aircraft, and then the most comfortable thing they
do is to step out the back door. And when they get on the ground,
of course, they're using up their adrenalin and they're nervous.
And so, they're just flat tired. We will be doing some work tonight
and we will be doing some work every night every night. But I think
that the progress has been reasonable, understanding that the
operation has not been going on yet for a full day.
   The command and control, in my own opinion, has been excellent.
The chain of command is short and effective from the Secretary of
Defense through the Chairman (of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) to the
Commander-in-Chief in Panama to the field commander, who is also
the Commander of the 18th Airborne Corps. And everybody in the
country who carries a gun works for him.
   I'd be happy to address some of your questions now.
   Q: General, how _ the Rio Hato situation _ how many troops in _
that's the Montes _ de los Machos?
   GEN. KELLY: The Men of the Mountain are the 7th Infantry Company.
   Q: Yes _ how many of them escaped? I mean, what kind of forces _
   GEN. KELLY: Hard to say, because we think only about a half of
them were there in the first place. They had some of these folks _
and Ted's the expert on that _ but they were at the Comandancia.
They had a real mixed bag of people at the Comandancia, protecting
it. It seemed that Noriega, in his latter days as dictator, liked
to keep moving people around to keep them loose. Ted, do you want
to add to that?
   ADM. SHEAFER: Half the 7th Company was up at the Comandancia.
   Q: At the Comandancia down at Rio Hato?
   ADM. SHEAFER: At the Comandancia. You've got 250 at Rio Hato _
is that right?
   GEN. KELLY: 250 detainees _ yes. And if that was half the 7th
Company _ excuse me _ most of the 6th Company, we got a pretty good
slug of them, I would think, and I wouldn't think more than about
75 _
   ADM. SHEAFER: We haven't had a chance to go through all of the
detainees yet, and get an order _
   Q: Good intelligence _ but you think you got a number of them at
the Comandancia?
   ADM. SHEAFER: Yes.
   Q: General, what can you tell us about the hostage situations?
What can you tell us about the different hotels that house
Americans that apparently the troops have had trouble getting to?
What is the situation, and why have the troops had trouble getting
to these hotels?
   GEN. KELLY: We now have a clear understanding of the importance
of getting to the hotels. We don't plan to tell you how we're going
to do that, because we don't want to help those who are possibly
around the hotels.
   Incidentally, in some cases people are isolated in hotels, but
they're not hostages because they're not being held by anybody.
   Our original strategy was to attack the PDF and to break its
structure down. I think we've pretty much done that. Now, we'll
move in with much greater force into the built-up areas of Panama
City in order to be able to protect the Americans and other people
who are there.
   Incidentally, we don't have an effective police force in Panama
City either _ a Panamanian police force _ one of the things we
would hope to get re-established fairly quicky.
   Just let me add one thing. We know of no Americans who've been
killed as the result of any of this.
   Q: General _
   Q: General, can you tell us, is there an ongoing hostage
situation there? Are you aware of hostages? How many do there
appear to be? How much of a problem is it for you?
   GEN. KELLY: We have reports of hostages. Some of those reports
seem credible. None of those reports have been verified by our
military. And I think I'll ask Ted to add anything to that that you
would choose.

   Q: Did you go to the _
   Q: So, you said that was where heavy fighting was, so you think
you got _ got rid of a lot of them there?
   ADM. SHEAFER: We've been trying to track each of the hostage
reports, and we have probably almost a dozen. And we have great
difficulty with the information we have in corroborating any of
them. They vary in numbers ranging from the lows of two or threes,
to the highs in the teens.
   Q: But Admiral, there was a CBS news producer taken captive at
one hotel with an ABC producer, and that ABC producer has been
released. How can you say that's not a credible report?
   ADM. SHEAFER: If that's true, I'm unaware of it.
   Q: General, do you have any information about _
   Q: What role is the military playing playing in the search for
General Noriega?
   GEN. KELLY: Pardon?
   Q: What role is the military playing in the search for General
Noriega? And how is that going?
   GEN. KELLY: Every role we can. We have every spigot turned on
that we can turn on to find the fugitive, Mr. Noriega, and we
expect we eventually will.
   I _ let's start with this gentleman _
   Q: Just following that up, General, if I might. You said at the
outset, or at least we were told this morning, one of the aims was
to capture General Noriega. Can you walk us through why that
apparently failed, at least in its initial stages. Were you in the
right place? Was he in the wrong place?
   GEN. KELLY: Ahhh. He was obviously in the right place. He's a
crafty devil, as you know. He grew up in a very tough academy, so
he's been used to this for many years. He allegedly changes his
place of residence about four times a night. We had him spotted
several times during the day. We thought we had a pretty good idea
where he was last night. We went there and he wasn't there.
   Q: Where was that?
   GEN. KELLY: I would _ I'd prefer not to say because he may go
back there and we may want to go back there again. But, we're
looking for him very hard. Of course, that's all contingent on
intelligence. And what I meant to say when ``we had all the spigots
turned on'' is, we are turning on all our looking, listening, and
hearing devices to see if we can't pick him up.
   Q: When you say _ excuse me for interrupting you, General. When
you say that you spotted him several times today, are you
suggesting to us _
   GEN. KELLY: Not today _ I said yesterday.
   Q: Yesterday. You're suggesting to us, though, that you're not
far away from him, that you expect to capture him. Can you make
that kind of commitment?
   GEN. KELLY: No, I can't. You would probably have to ask my boss
for that kind of commitment. But, I'd just tell you we're going to
try as hard as we know how to try to help Mr. Noriega get a plane
ride up here.
   Q: General _
   Q: Sir, have you spotted him at all today _ since this attack
began?
   GEN. KELLY: Have we spotted him today? No, we have not. He has
gone underground.
   Q: General, one of the other missions _ stated goals for this
mission was to provide greater safety for Americans in Panama.
Especially in view of what you just said, you all don't where some
of these PDF forces have gone _ off into the jungles, or they may
re-emerge in urban areas. How exactly has this operation improved
safety for Americans? And what kind of safety are you going to
provide on the streets of Panama?
   GEN. KELLY: First, I had also said, we know of no American yet
who has been injured as a result of this operation with the
exception of one American dependent which I think you know about
who was killed yesterday.
   Second, we said we have a concern that they have gone off into
the jungle. We don't know for a fact that that's what they've done.
If they have gone off into the jungle, I think there's every chance
that we'll go off after them.
   I think that by tomorrow you'll begin to see a greater presence
on the streets of Panama City. One of the main reasons that we went
down with the size force we're going down with, and it's very
substantial, is to protect life and property. And our goals, when
we went to Panama, was to keep the Canal open, to protect American
lives, to protect American property, and to prepare _ to help the
Panamanians re-achieve democracy.
   Q: Do you think Americans there now are safe today?
   GEN. KELLY: In the main, yes, I do. None of them have been hurt.

   A military court sentenced three Palestinians
to life prison terms Wednesday for a firebomb attack on an Israeli
bus that killed a rabbi's daughter, her three children and an
Israeli soldier, the army said.
   After sentencing, Israeli soldiers tried to assault the
prisoners and turned on journalists as they left the court, Israel
radio reported. No injuries were reported.
   Last week, the court in Ramallah found Ahmad Takruri, 22; Jumaa
Adam, 20, and Mahmud Abu Harbish, 19, guilty of causing the deaths
by throwing firebombs at the bus as it passed through the biblical
town of Jericho in the occupied West Bank.
   It found the attack to be premeditated, and also convicted the
men of preparing firebombs in three prior instances. Adam was given
two years beyond life because of a two-year suspended sentence for
an earlier conviction.
   The attack occurred on Oct. 30, 1988, two days before national
elections. It was thought to have given a last-minute boost to
rightist parties such as Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud
bloc, which urged tougher action against the Palestinian uprising.
   There had been expectations the three would be sentenced to
death after military Judge Lt. Col. Yosef Shapira said last week
the court was not bound by the prosecution's request for life
sentences.
   The army prosecutor, Capt. Moshe Bachar, said at the time a
request for the death sentence was rejected in consultations with
high-ranking authorities.
   The only person ever executed in Israel was Nazi war criminal
Adolf Eichmann, who was hanged in 1962.
   Chief of Staff Dan Shomron said at the time of the attack that
it was ``spontaneous'' and ill-planned.
   ``It was a group of guys who were sitting around at night
playing cards and decided to throw a firebomb at a passing bus,''
he said.
   The three were said to have hidden in a banana grove and hurled
firebombs through the open windows of the passenger bus traveling
from Tiberias to Jerusalem.
   Rachel Weiss, a 27-year-old school teacher, and her sons
Netanel, 3, Rafael, 2, and 9-month-old Efraim were burned to death.
David Delarosa, a soldier who tried to rescue the family, suffered
severe burns and died later.
   On Oct. 30, a Jerusalem court handed down the stiffest sentence
of the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli rule, giving a
Palestinian 16 life terms for forcing a passenger bus off a cliff
and killing 16 people.
   At least 631 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during
the revolt, and 43 Israelis have been slain. Another 161
Palestinians have been killed by their fellow Arabs as suspected
collaborators with Israel.

   Cold weather extended deep into the South and the Southwest on
Wednesday, with record lows in the nation's midsection, and heavy
snow fell around Lake Erie.
   Overnight temperatures reached 32 degrees or lower as far as
much of North Carolina, south carolina, northern Georgia, northern
Alabama, northern Mississippi, much of Louisiana, northern
two-thirds of Texas, New Mexico, northeastern two-thirds of
Arizona, east-central and north-central California, eastern
two-thirds of Oregon, and the eastern half of Washington state.
   Below zero temperatures extended from across the upper half of
the Plains, western Ohio, northern Maine, and the northeastern half
of Montana.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was 34 below zero at
International Falls and Warroad, Minn. Unofficially, Embarrass, in
northeastfern Minnesota, reached 37 degrees below zero.
   Wednesday's record lows were 2 at Calico Rock, Ark.; 9 at Hot
Springs, Ark.; 4 at Paducah, Ky.; 12 below zero at Peoria, Ill.; 14
below at Springfield, Ill.; and 11 below at Waukesha, Wis.
   More than 100 low temperature records for the date have been
broken or tied during the past week.
   At noon, wind chill effects over South Dakota ranged from 20
below zero in the south to 50 below zero in the north. Wind chills
reached 45 below zero in Upper Michigan.
   Snow fell at midday over northeastern New York state, from

   In the snow belt of western New York state, where the moisture
of Lake Erie contributes to ``lake effect'' snow, a highway was
closed by 4-foot snow drifts between Holland and Sardina in
southern Erie County.
   In northwestern Pennsylvania, also near Lake Erie, 12.4 inches
of snow fell overnight at Erie, 4 of that in one hour, and the

   Iran protested to Britain on Wednesday
about British plans to deport two Iranian students suspected of
planning to kill Indian-born Salman Rushdie, author of the novel
``The Satanic Verses.''
   Tehran television said Iran's Foreign Ministry sent an official
protest to London through the Swedish Embassy, which looks after
Iranian interests in Britain.
   Tehran also condemned the arrest of two other Iranians who were
freed late Tuesday.
   Iran cut ties with Britain last February after Britain protested
a death sentence imposed on Rushdie, a British citizen, by Iran's
revolutionary leader, the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Khomeini said ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemed Islam, provoking a
worldwide furor over the book.
   The four Iranians were arrested Friday under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act, which gives police the right to hold them for seven
days without charge.
   The Home Office said Tuesday that engineering students Karen
Abrinia, 32, and Mehrdad Kokabi, 33, were being deported for
``reasons of national security.'' It did not elaborate.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted the
students' lawyer, Zahir Aziz, as saying they believed they were
arrested because they were suspected of planning to assassinate
Rushdie, who remains in hiding.
   The two freed Iranians were identified as Hussein Gharibi and
Javad Mousavi, 40, a disabled father of four children.
   Both IRNA and Tehran TV were monitored in Nicosia.

<HEAD>Allegations That Dogs Were Buried Alive at Landfill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A regional humane society is
investigating charges that a county dog pound has been burying
alive unwanted dogs and cats, officials said Wednesday.
   A number of people reported seeing animals squirming in the back
of a pickup that was taking animals to a landfill for burial.
However, Franklin County officials are denying that the animals,
which were supposed to have been killed by carbon monoxide
poisoning, were alive when buried.
   Debbie Allen, who works at the landfill office, said she was
working Tuesday when a truck filled with animals in plastic bags
from the Franklin County Dog Pound pulled up.
   ``I saw movement in the back of the truck,'' Ms. Allen said.
``At first I thought it was the wind, but then I noticed it made a
teepee effect, like a paw reaching up.''
   The driver, who was outside the truck to obtain papers from Ms.
Allen's office, ``swatted the bag with the back of his hand,'' Ms.
Allen said. ``Then he pulled up two other trash bags as if he was
trying to cover it up.''
   Franklin County Board member Cliff Cockrum said the animals were
checked before they left the pound in Benton. The board oversees
the pound.
   ``When we destroyed animals yesterday (Tuesday) morning we had a
veterinarian to check each and every animal and he assured us that
each one was dead before they left the pound,'' Cockrum said.
   Billy Hammond Sr. of Benton said he and his two sons examined
four dogs they found at the landfill.
   ``One of them my boy picked up and it gave out a pitiful whine
and then it went limp in his arms,'' he said Wednesday. The other
three animals were warm and limp and appeared to have been dead
only minutes, Hammond said.
   Cockrum called the reports by Ms. Allen and Hammond hearsay.
   About 45 animals are destroyed every two weeks at the pound.
They are put in steel boxes linked to the exhaust pipe of a vehicle
and are asphyxiated with carbon monoxide, Cockrum said.
   The carcasses are dumped at the landfill within two hours of
death, including the 45-minute ride from Benton to Carbondale.
Cockrum said 28 animals were killed Tuesday, including eight or
nine cats.
   Hammond said he found another dog barely alive in October and
asked the state Department of Agriculture to perform an autopsy on
the dog. Dr. D.K. Mann confirmed that he performed the procedure at
the department's Animal Disease Laboratory in Centralia.
   The autopsy found that the dog had been alive about three hours
after it was buried, Hammond said. It also found that the animal's
organs were severely burned from inhaling carbon monoxide, Hammond
said.
   Frantz Dantzler, regional director for the Humane Society of the
United States, said asphyxiation with carbon monoxide is an
``extremely painful'' method of euthanasia. The most humane and
least painful method is lethal injection of barbiturates, he said.
   Dantzler said his offers to the county for help in finding a
more humane euthansia system were ignored.
   The society plans to investigate the matter further, Dantzler
said in a telephone interview from his home in South Bend, Ind.

<TEXT>
   In another time, another president said he
would not see the United States made into ``a pitiful, helpless
giant.'' The phrase echoed as President Bush ordered American
troops to crush and capture Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whose
Panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of American sanctions
short of force.
   Part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours
on Wednesday with the Pentagon declaring that Noriega had been
removed as the strongarm leader of Panama.
   But he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his
loyalist forces. The United States called him a fugitive, and said
he would be tracked and taken, to stand trial on U.S. drug
trafficking indictments.
   For more than two years, Noriega had taunted and incited the
giant, while his foes at home and in Washington tried futilely to
dislodge his grip on power. Bush, whose watchword is prudence, said
it was an enormous frustration. But he took it for nearly a year,
for lack of an acceptable alternative.
   Then he took a risk, and went to war. ``Fellow citizens, last
night I ordered U.S. military forces to Panama,'' he told the
nation Wednesday. ``I took this action only after reaching the
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of
American citizens were in grave danger.''
   Bush gained prompt and predictable support at home, from
Democrats as well as Republicans. He had briefed congressional
leaders just before U.S. forces went into combat against Noriega's
loyalists in the Panama Defense Forces.
   Presidents seldom face much political dissent when American
forces are in combat, especially with the kind of provocations
Noriega provided. His puppet assembly had declared a state of war
with the United States, and an off-duty American officer was shot
and killed by his forces on Saturday.
   Bush recounted the killing, the wounding of another American
serviceman, the capture and beating of a third and threats against
that man's wife.
   ``That was enough,'' the president said.
   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in
Panama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens
in Panama,'' Bush said. ``And that is why I directed our armed
forces to protect the lives of American citizens in Panama, and to
bring Gen. Noriega to justice in the United States.''
   Bush had repeatedly encouraged Noriega's opponents to kick him
out of power. He had said that Noriega was the problem, that the
United States' quarrel was with the general alone and that his
ouster would bring normal diplomatic and economic relations.
   Yet when dissident officers attempted a coup on Oct. 3 and
briefly held Noriega, American forces stood by, inactive. U.S.
forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders,
but the administration decided against intervention.
   That drew protests from left and right, although some
Republicans complained that dovish Democrats who opposed
intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in
Panama.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said U.S. commanders had
been told they could offer support for the coup ``if there were an
opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant
loss of American life and to do so without open military
involvement.''
   Those instructions ring with irony now that U.S. forces have
been sent into open combat.
   On Wednesday, Baker recalled his October testimony, and the
administration explanation of U.S. inaction at the time of the coup
attempt.
   ``I said if this administration chose to use force, it would
make its own decisions,'' he told a news conference. ``It would not
act based on some unknown coup plotters' strategy or rationale.''
   The toll of American soldiers killed in action early Wednesday
mounted into the teens and scores were wounded.
   That is the price of using military power. It was Richard M.
Nixon who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use, 19 years
ago. ``If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful
nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless
giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free
nations and free institutions throughout the world,'' he said,
announcing he had sent forces to attack Communist North Vietnamese
sanctuaries in Cambodia.
   Bush was sure to hear told-you-so comments from those who argued
the administration should have sent forces to join the October coup.
   And Noriega's purge of dissident officers after that coup could
make it more difficult for the United States to quickly complete
operations and withdraw the additional troops, which Bush said he
wants to do as quickly as possible.
   The newly installed government of Panama _ led by Guillermo
Endara, thought to have won the May election Noriega annulled _
will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in
place of his henchmen.
   Stability under an elected government will be the real test of
success, whatever happens to Noriega. The administration has been
wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle. American
intervention puts that to the test: If the theory is correct and he
is powerless, Noriega is irrelevant.
   But if Noriega or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and
running continuing operations against U.S. forces and the Endara
government, the administration will have a major problem on its
hands.
   When President Ronald Reagan ordered American forces into action
in the 1983 invasion of Grenada and the 1986 air raid on Libya, the
operations were swift and brief. The Bush administration wants
intervention in Panama to be a mission accomplished and quickly
ended. Prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at
home and intensify the inevitable Latin American resentment against
Yankee intervention, no matter the cause.
   Bush sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out
swiftly, by lifting economic sanctions against Panama under the new
Endara government, and by promising anew that the United States
will turn the canal over to Panama at the end of the century.

   U.S. officials made plans Wednesday for the
possible extradition of embattled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega in
the event he is captured, but his attorneys said he would rather
die than surrender.
   Noriega would be flown to a military base in south Florida and
transferred to a secure location to await trial in Miami on federal
drug charges, said a U.S. Marshals Service official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   But his attorneys said Noriega, who was in hiding Wednesday as
more than 20,000 U.S. troops stormed through Panama, may never be
captured.
   ``He's a fighter,'' said Miami attorney Raymond Takiff, who said
he talked with his client Monday evening and remained in contact
with the general's aides Wednesday. ``I feel unhappily secure in my
belief that he will be killed, he will not be captured. Should that
occur, the truth will never come out.''
   The Justice Department and the Marshals Service refused to
release details about Noriega's possible extradition or where he
would be detained, citing security concerns.
   ``If General Noriega is apprehended and brought here for trial,
he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused of
a crime _ no more, no less. All his rights will be protected,''
said U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler, the trial judge in
the Miami indictment.
   Noriega and 16 associates face federal drug-trafficking
indictments returned by grand juries in Miami and Tampa in 1988. He
would be tried first on the Miami charges, Justice Department
spokesman David Runkel said.
   Another Noriega attorney, Frank Rubino, echoed the sentiment
that the general would never allow U.S. forces to take him alive.
   ``The general is alive, well and somewhere in Panama, and he is
on top of the situation, as far as leading his forces,'' said
Rubino, who predicted the presence of U.S. troops would lead to
more bloodshed.
   President Bush cited Noriega's declaration Friday of a state of
war as a reason for the invasion, but Takiff vehemently denied the
general ever declared war on the United States.
   Noriega's U.S. attorneys had agreed to publicly resign if he
declared war, and closely examined a copy of the text in which he
apparently made the declaration, Takiff said.
   ``What was said by Noriega and by the national assembly was that
because of events, the country was living as if they were in a
state of war,'' he said. ``We were satisfied that he had never
declared war on the United States.''
   ``No one, no matter how strained the context, could consider
that a declaration of war,'' said Takiff, acknowledging that he did
not know if Noriega had departed from his prepared text in his
speech to the assembly.
   Rubino said the drug charges against Noriega were politically
motivated.
   ``Before the United States used the CIA in a covert way to
topple governments. Now they are using indictment diplomacy,''
Rubino said.
   Former U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle, who brought the Tampa
indictment against Noriega and now practices law in Clearwater,
said the military dictator is just another criminal.
   ``The indictments were not instigated by the State Department
and they were not brought for any political purpose whatsoever,''
Merkle said. ``All this yammering about indictment for political
purposes is pure hogwash.''
   A trial is scheduled Jan. 8 in Miami for two of Noriega's
co-defendants, but prosecutors had requested a continuance before
Wednesday's actions because they need more time to prepare their
case.
   ``The government will come to court with strong evidence against
General Noriega,'' said Richard Gregorie, the former chief
assistant U.S. attorney who presented the Miami indictment to a
grand jury in February 1988.
   In the two indictments, Noriega is charged with accepting $10
million in bribes from Medellin Cartel drug traffickers to protect
smugglers and cocaine shipments, launder cash and supply drug
laboratories. He faces up to 145 years in prison and more than $1.1
million in fines if convicted.
   ``If Noriega's not rounded up soon, he could probably go to Cuba
or Nicaragua, or he could start up a guerrilla movement with all
the arms he has stashed away,'' said Luis Endara, a cousin of
Panama's new president, Guillermo Endara.

<TEXT>
   A legislator was convicted Wednesday
of spying for communist North Korea and sentenced to 15 years in
prison.
   Judge Hong Suk-je dismissed Rep. Suh Kyung-won's claims he was
tortured to make false confessions that he was a spy for South
Korea's archenemy.
   ``It was hard to find evidence to support the claims of torture,
considering the confessions signed by the defendant during an
interrogation by prosecutors,'' Hong said.
   The sentence had been expected to be heavier, but the judge said
the breakdown of the Cold War was taken into consideration.
   The defense counsel criticized the verdict as improper and said
the ruling would be appealed. The prosecution, which had sought
life imprisonment for Suh, also said it would appeal. The maximum
penalty for espionage is death.
   Suh had told the court that during a 50-day investigation by the
Agency for National Security Planning, the government intelligence
organization, he was forced to make false confessions that he had
spied for North Korea.
   He said he had been denied contact with lawyers during the
period and kept awake for many days. Government officials denied
the charges.
   Also Wednesday, riot police firing tear gas stormed a university
campus in Seoul to break up a rally by hundreds of students
demanding the release of Im Chong-suk, a jailed radical student
leader.
   About 700 students throwing firebombs and rocks fought police
for two hours in and around Yonsei University in the third day of
campus protests. Several students were taken away by police, but no
figures were available on arrests or injuries.
   Im was chairman of the National Council of Student
Representatives, a nationwide anti-government, anti-U.S.
organization.
   The spy case was generally considered the most serious in recent
South Korean history because it involved a national lawmaker with
ongoing contact with communist North Korea. Suh admitted he visited
North Korea but denied he was a spy.
   Suh, a farmer-turned politician, was convicted of espionage and
``leaking state secrets'' to North Korea.
   The judge said overwhelming evidence indicated Suh, 52, secretly
visited North Korean leader Kim Il Sung last year, received
$120,000 from communist agents and had ongoing contact and
communications with the communist nation, all in violation of the
National Security Law.
   The judge also ordered Suh to forfeit $49,000 in unspent funds,
allegedly from North Korea.
   The judge, in handing down the sentence, said, ``It was taken
into consideration that international trends have turned from the
Cold War era to an atmosphere of reconciliation since his (Suh's)
visit to the North and the Seoul government has been pursuing an
active Northern policy'' aimed at easing tensions.
   He said the state secrets leaked by Suh to North Korea were not
sensitive but said Suh contacted North Korea before his 1988
election to the National Assembly, as well as after.
   After Suh's arrest June 28, a dozen lawmakers, businessmen and
aides were questioned or jailed by national security agents.
   Two-time presidential candidate Kim Dae-jung, leader of the
leading opposition Party for Peace and Democracy, was indicted for
allegedly failing to report Suh's visit to North Korea. Kim denied
it and Suh was expelled from the party.
   Suh's aide, Pang Yang-kyun, was convicted of being an accessory
Wednesday and sentenced to seven years in prison. Six others were
given suspended sentences ranging from 10 months to one year for
failing to report Suh's trip to North Korea, as is required by law.

   The attack appeared to be in protest against Romania's
suppression of anti-government demonstrations in Timisoara, where
hundreds reportedly died.
   The Foreign Ministry earlier expressed Israel's ``deep sorrow''
over the loss of life in Romania and said it hoped Romanian

   Investigators probing mail bombs that killed a
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer are examining anonymous
letters mailed last summer that threatened the federal judiciary,
the FBI said Thursday.
   The letters, which surfaced in Jackson, Miss., Milwaukee,
Minneapolis and an undisclosed location in California, may be an
important clue in the FBI-led probe of the two fatal mail-bombs in
the South, said FBI spokesman Greg Jones.
   ``We are examining those letters to try to determine whether or
not there is a link between those threats in August and the matters
at hand today,'' Jones said.
   The bombs killed Judge Robert S. Vance of the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals and Robert E. Robinson, a Savannah, Ga., alderman
and civil rights lawyer. Other parcel bombs were found at the 11th
Circuit court in Atlanta and the Jacksonville, Fla. NAACP office.
   The FBI says it believes all four similarly packaged bombs were
mailed from locations in Georgia. The bombs were similarly
constructed of nails and explosives, authorities say.
   Television stations in Jackson, Miss., and Milwaukee received
letters bearing Aug. 21 Atlanta postmarks. That was the day before
a tear-gas cannister was thrown into the NAACP headquarters in
Atlanta, injuring eight people.
   Jones refused to discuss the contents of the letters but he said
they were similar in content.
   The ones received by WAPT-TV in Jackson and WITI in Milwaukee
were titled ``Declaration of War'' against the 11th Circuit Court
of Appeals. according to copies made available by the stations.
   They threatened poison gas attacks on heavily populated areas
``until widespread terror forces the court to adopt the impartial
and equitable treatment of all as its highest priority.''
   The Justice Department said Tuesday that the investigation is
concentrating on racial motivations for the killings and the bomb
incidents.
   FBI Director William Sessions said investigators are checking
Vance's court docket. The director said he wouldn't be surprised if
a decision Vance once made motivated the killing.
   Vance ruled in favor of the Jacksonville NAACP on Sept. 15 in a
school desegregation case.
   Jones said all four letters were examined last summer by the FBI
crime laboratory in Washington but yielded no physical clues such
as fingerprints. U.S. Marshals in the various jurisdictions where
the letters were received were told of the threats, he said.

<HEAD>Moldavians Ask Congress to Appeal for Reason</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moldavian delegates, worried about their ethnic
brethren in Romania, asked the Soviet Congress on Wednesday to
appeal for ``reason and order'' there.
   Ion Drutse, a well-known Moldavian poet, said the Stalinist
regime of President Nicolae Ceausescu might embark on a new wave of
repression against Romanians seeking greater democracy.
   ``It would cost him nothing to build his palace of the skulls of
his subjects,'' Drutse told a reporter in the lobby of the
Kremlin's Palace of Congresses.
   Anti-government protests began last weekend in Timisoara, a city
of 350,000 people in Transylvania, western Romania. Estimates of
the number of people killed by Ceausescu's security forces reach
the thousands.
   Soviet Moldavia, a small repubic of about 4 million people, is
on Romania's eastern border. Moldavians are essentially ethnic
Romanians whose territory has gone back and forth, last falling
into the Soviet sphere during World War II. The declaration
proposed by the Moldavian legislators expresses hope that ``all
problems will be solved in the framework of reason and order'' and
through dialogue between the Romanian government and population,
Drutse said.
   Moldavians said they asked the Congress leadership to put the
declaration up for a vote, but it had not been done by Wednesday
evening.
   Drutse said he believed passing the declaration could help ease
tension in Romania because every ``tyrant is afraid of something.''
   The Soviet Union has made no move toward intervening in its
ally's affairs.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim Perfiliev said Wednesday a
``massive flow of information'' made it hard to judge what was
happening in Romania, but if reports of loss of life were
confirmed, ``this is a reason for profound regret.''
   Official media have taken a critical tone toward Ceausescu's
Stalinist regime.

<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday confirmed
Fernando Collor de Mello, a conservative who advocates a
free-market economy, as winner of Brazil's first free presidential
election in 29 years.
   Collor de Mello, a 40-year-old native of Rio de Janeiro and head
of the rightist National Reconstruction Party, had 34,698,234
votes, or 42.74 percent, after 98.9 percent of the votes had been
tallied, Supreme Electoral Court spokesman Irineu Tamanini said.
   His socialist rival, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the radical
left Workers Party, received 30,929,253 votes, 38.10 per cent. Da
Silva conceded he had lost late Wednesday.
   Tamanini said 1.2 percent of the ballots were blank, 3.81
percent were annulled and 14.15 percent were abstentions. Voting is
mandatory for Brazilians aged 18 to 69.
   Tamanini said the final vote count wouldn't be announced until
Thursday because torrential rain in northern Brazil delayed the
transfer of ballot boxes from the Amazon states of Para and Amapa
to Brasilia, the federal capital.
   The Court would officially announce Collor de Mello the winner
on Dec. 29, he said. The president-elect is scheduled to take
office Mar. 15, 1990, for a five-year term. He will succeed Jose
Sarney, who by law cannot run for re-election.

   Specialists refloated a grounded oil tanker
on Wednesday and traffic resumed in the Suez Canal, canal officials
said.
   The 138,536-ton Liberian-registered Lauberhorn had just begun
its northward passage from Suez when it ran aground in heavy fog
just north of the city Tuesday morning.
   At least 109 ships had to wait for the east-west passage to be
cleared.
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that
after about 10,000 tons of crude oil were taken off the Lauberhorn,
the tanker was refloated at high tide at 2:50 p.m. Canal traffic
was resumed at 11 p.m.
   They said the tanker was towed to Zenobia area, near Suez, which
is at the canal's southern tip.
   The grounding caused a crack in the bow up to nine feet long,
leading to a minor spill from the 73,000 tons of crude the ship had
taken on at an Iranian terminal in the Persian Gulf.
   Ezzat Adel, the Suez Canal Authority's director, said the spill
had been cleaned up and the crack sealed.
   The Lauberhorn is managed by Brokerage and Management Co. of New
York City, according to Lloyd's Registry.

<HEAD>Invasion Legal Under U.S., International Law, Administration Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs to include comment from Yale law professor.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush adminstration argued Wednesday that
the U.S. invasion of Panama was legal under both domestic and
international law but some lawyers who have tried war-powers cases
disagreed.
   Secretary of State James Baker cited Article 51 of the United
Nations Charter that gives nations the right to act in self-defense
and a similar provision of the Organization of American States
treaty as the legal basis for the invasion.
   Article 21 of the OAS treaty gives the United States the right
to protect its citizens, installations and institutions, the
secretary said.
   Baker also cited the terms of the Panama Canal Treaty that give
the United States the right to exercise force to protect the canal
to keep it operating.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh advised President Bush about
the legality of the operation before it was launched, said Justice
Department spokesman David Runkel.
   Thornburgh ``believes there is a legal basis for this action
being taken under U.S. law,'' Runkel said. ``It is my understanding
there is clearly legal authority under both U.S. law and
international law.''
   But two attorneys for the Center for Constitutional Rights, a
liberal New York-based civil liberties group, disagree.
   `I'd say it's clearly illegal under the UN Charter and the OAS
charter,'' said attorney Jules Lobel, who is also a law professor
at the University of Pittsburgh.
   ``The United States doesn't have the right to unilaterally
decide to overthrow another governent by the use of force,'' Lobel
said. ``Nothing that the president said today or the secretary of
state said would give the the United States such a right.''
   Lobel said the United States must show it is acting in
self-defense for the invasion to be legal under the UN Charter and
the OAS treaty.
   ``I don't think that can be based on some speculated threat that
American citizens might be endangered,'' Lobel said. Baker had
cited an intelligence report that Panamanian Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noreiga was poised to attack Americans.
   ``If American citizens might be endangered, the obvious thing to
do is to protect them and evacuate them not overthrow the
government,'' Lobel said.
   Both Lobel and David Cole, another attorney for the center, said
the invasion also violated the war-powers provision of the
Constitution, which requires congressional approval of the
deployment of troops in this fashion.
   ``I think the intent of the framers of the Constitution is
clear, if the United States is going to offensively use military
force abroad it must be approved by Congress and not by four
leaders in Congress,'' Lobel said.
   ``As a purely technical constitutional matter, the president
does not have the authority to do what he did,'' Cole said. ``As a
matter of legal and political reality, if Congress doesn't try to
stop him, I think it's unlikely the courts would.''
   Yale University law professor Harold Koh voiced caution about
the invasion, saying ``the rationale of protecting the securityof
the canal must be limited to making sure there is no damage to the
canal or some impairment of the security of the canal.''
   ``It can't be an all-purpose justification of wide-ranging
actions to restructure the government,'' Koh said.
   Koh also expressed skepticism about justifying the invasion as
an effort to arrest Noriega. ``As a matter of international law,
there is a danger in converting political action into so-called
crime fighting action.''

   Civil rights leaders said Wednesday
they've made progress in this northeast Florida city, but the
mailing of a bomb to NAACP headquarters recalls recent racial
tensions that had begun to fade.
   The bomb disarmed here Tuesday was similar to devices which
killed a federal appeals court judge and a Savannah, Ga., civil
rights leader.
   Bombs mailed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta and
to the Jacksonville office of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People were disarmed without causing any
damage or injuries.
   Possible links to NAACP school desegregation efforts have been
identified in all four cases, leading to theories that a racist
group may be responsible.
   Racial tensions were heightened here in September when three
black City Council members were ordered arrested after they walked
out of a meeting to protest lack of funding for predominantly black
areas in the city budget.
   One of them, attorney Deitra Micks, was arrested in a City Hall
women's room and hauled back to the council meeting in handcuffs.
The arrests were ordered by City Council President Tillie Fowler,
who is white, so the council would have a quorum.
   ``And all of a sudden this happened, so it just brings up this
whole issue of race again,'' the Rev. John Newman, a black
minister, said Wednesday. ``Jacksonville is sitting on a racial
powder keg, I'm sorry to report.''
   Black leaders said they were angry about Tuesday's discovery of
the bomb, but it will not deter them from their work.
   ``We will go on with our business as usual. We will not let this
incident stop us from doing the job we have set out to do,'' said
Willye Dennis, the local president of the NAACP. She received the
explosive package Monday, but didn't have time to open it then.
   She had a more optimistic view of racial tension in the city.
   ``We've come a long way in Jacksonville, but we have a long way
to go,'' she said.
   City Council member Terry Wood, who is white, said he believes
tensions have eased since the walkout. ``But there are elements on
both sides who can point to certain events and say improvements are
superficial,'' said Wood.
   Newman, pastor of the Mount Calvary Baptist Church, said the
organization has received criticism from both whites and blacks for
its positions.
   ``On one hand we have threats from whites, perhaps racists, who
want to destroy us because of positions of ideology ... and on the
other hand, to try to stop drugs we have threats from blacks who
happened to be drug dealers who want to blow us away,'' Newman said.
   The FBI said Wednesday that all four bombs had Georgia postmarks
or return addresses.
   FBI agent William Hinshaw, in charge of the Atlanta office, said
the first parcel bomb, addressed to federal Judge Robert S. Vance,
was mailed last Thursday from Newnan, Ga., to Vance's home in
Mountain Brook, Ala., a suburb of Birmingham. Vance was killed and
his wife was seriously injured.
   The bomb that killed Savannah, Ga., alderman and attorney Robert
E. Robinson on Monday is believed to have been mailed Friday from
Macon, Hinshaw said. The bomb found in Jacksonville also was mailed
Friday from Macon, he said.
   Another bomb was mailed Saturday from the Atlanta area to the
11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals clerk's office in Atlanta,
Hinshaw said.
   The investigation is concentrating in part on possible links to
NAACP school desegregation efforts:
   _ The 11th Circuit hears federal appeals from Georgia, Florida
and Alabama, including desegregation cases.
   _ Vance, an 11th Circuit judge, wrote the court's September
ruling in favor of the Jacksonville NAACP in its desegregation suit
against Jacksonville schools.
   _ Robinson was the Savannah NAACP's local counsel and helped
with an NAACP suit against the Savannah schools. The NAACP lost
that case at the 11th Circuit, and the three-judge panel did not
include Vance.
   _ Robinson also had advised the Jacksonville NAACP chapter in
its desegregation case, according to a Jacksonville activist, the
Rev. Fred Newbill.

   Here is a brief summary of events in Panama:
   _U.S. troops attacked Panamanian Defense Forces bases, capturing
or dispersing most PDF troops. U.S. forces appeared to have gained
control but fighting continued.
   _President Bush said in a televised address he ordered American
troops into action ``to protect the lives of American citizens in
Panama and bring Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega to justice in the
United States.''
   _Noriega was not captured and was in hiding. The United States
$1 million for information leading to his capture.
   _Fifteen American servicemen and one American civilian were
reported killed. One hospital reported at least 52 other people
died.
   _Hostages were reportedly taken from the Marriott Hotel by
Panamanian paramilitary troops. It was unclear how many were
captured and whether all were released.
   _Opposition leader Guillermo Endara was sworn in as president.
The United States recognized his government. The Organization of
American States refused.
   _Most members of Congress in both parties supported the action.
   _The Soviet Union condemned the attack as a violation of
international law.

<HEAD>Bush Says Military Strike `Decapitates' Noriega From Dictatorship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERENCE HUNT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP White House Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   President Bush said Wednesday he ordered the
military strike in Panama to seize Manuel Antonio Noriega and end
``reckless threats and attacks'' against Americans. Noriega eluded
capture and the administration put a $1 million bounty on his head.
   Even though Noriega dropped out of sight, the United States
said, ``As a practical matter, we have decapitated him from the
dictatorship.''
   The White House announced a $1 million reward for information
leading to his capture. In addition, Panamanians were offered $150
for each firearm they surrendered.
   Pentagon officials declared the operation in Panama a military
success, saying Noriega's forces mostly had fled or were fleeing
though some fighting continued.
   Reaction from Congress, both Democratic and Republican, was
mostly favorable.
   Bush, hoping to break a nearly two-year stalemate with Noriega,
dispatched 9,500 soldiers and Marines to back up the 13,000 U.S.
troops already in Panama for a 1 a.m. assault against army bases
and the general's headquarters.
   In a televised address from the Oval Office, a somber Bush told
the nation, ``I took this action only after reaching the conclusion
that every other avenue was closed and the lives of American
citizens were in grave danger.''
   In the fighting _ codenamed ``Operation Just Cause'' by the
Pentagon _ 15 U.S. military personnel were killed, many more were
wounded and one was missing. In addition, a woman dependent was
killed, the Pentagon said.
   Four helicopters crashed, believed to have been brought down by
gunfire.
   Noting the loss of American lives, Bush said, ``No president
takes such action lightly.''
   Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, Army deputy chief of staff, said, ``One dead
American is too many, but thank God the numbers don't appear too
high right now.'' He said, ``It looks like the organized resistance
is a thing of the past.''
   Bush, up much of the night, monitored the fighting in Panama. He
took a break Wednesday evening to attend a White House Christmas
party.
   Some Americans were reported taken hostage in the Marriott Hotel
in Panama City. Late in the day, U.S. Marines arrived at the site
and escorted many Americans out of the building.
   Kelly called Noriega ``a crafty devil'' and said he had not been
spotted Wednesday.
   He said U.S. forces had observed Noriega several times on
Tuesday. ``We thought we had a pretty good idea of where he was
last night. We went there and he wasn't there.''
   ``He has gone to ground,'' Kelly said. Even so, he expressed
confidence Noriega would be located, saying ``we have every spigot
turned on'' to find him. He said there was no indication Noriega
had left Panama.
   The general said ``much of the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces)
is fleeing in the face of the U.S. military units.''
   He added, ``We have a concern that they have gone off into the
jungle. There is every chance that we will go off after them.''
   Kelly said he expected the canal to reopen Thursday.
   Bush said the United States would withdraw its force as soon as
possible. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said he could not
speculate how long U.S. troops would remain in action.
   Bush was roundly criticized when he kept U.S. forces on the
sidelines during an unsuccessful coup attempt against Noriega on
Oct. 3.
   In contrast, congressional leaders generally supported the
president's decision to use force.
   ``When there is the engagement of U.S. forces in the field, it
behooves all of us to give that support,'' House Speaker Thomas
Foley said.
   ``It was made necessary by the reckless actions of Gen.
Noriega,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   But Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., called Bush's action ``a
trigger-happy act of gunboat diplomacy'' which violates the
Constitution. And, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Bush should not have acted
without the support and aid of other Central American nations.
   William J. Bennett, the director of national drug control
policy, said of Noriega, ``I think we can safely conclude that this
ends his career as a drug trafficker. He's not running drugs. He's
not running Panama. He's just running. And that's good.''

   The Organization of American States met in emergency session at
the request of Panamanian ambassador Jose Maria Cabrera, a holdover
from Noriega's regime.
   He told the gathering, ``Under no circumstances will we accept
some supposed leaders who are puppets imposed by the United
States,'' referring to the provisional government headed by
Guillermo Endara and recognized by the Bush administration.
   Endara asked the OAS in a letter to recognize Lawrence Chewning
Fabrega as his designated representative but the members decided to
recognize Cabrera, instead.
   Peru withdrew its ambassador to the United States in protest
``until the invading troops withdraw,'' according to a statement
from the Peruvian embassy.
   Bush, laying out the reasons for the military action, cited
Noriega's declaration last Friday of a state of war, the slaying of
an American officer last Saturday and the manhandling of an
American serviceman and his wife.
   ``Gen. Noriega's reckless threats and attacks upon Americans in
Panama created an imminent danger to the 35,000 American citizens
in Panama,'' Bush said. ``As president, I have no higher obligation
than to safeguard the lives of American citizens.
   ``And that is why I directed our armed forces to protect the
lives of American citizens in Panama and bring Gen. Noriega to
justice in the United States.''
   With Noriega on the run, Bush said the United States was lifting
economic sanctions against Panama and freeing Panamanian assets
frozen in U.S. banks.
   Baker said Bush decided Sunday to use force against Noriega.
   After that decision was made, Baker said, the United States
received intelligence reports that Noriega might launch a commando
attack against Americans in an urban residential neighborhood.
   While saying it was unclear whether the report was reliable,
Baker told reporters that if Americans had been killed or
terrorized, ``you would be asking us today, `Why didn't you act to
prevent this kind of violence against our citizens.'''
   The secretary added, ``I'm not going to tell you that the crisis
in Panama has been totally resolved. ... But Manuel Noriega, who
was yesterday's `maximum leader' is today's hunted fugitive.''
   Ever since Noriega was indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking
charges in February 1988, the United States has been trying to
force him from power through economic sanctions and diplomatic
pressure.
   The Soviet Union condemned the action, saying the United States
``must immediately stop its armed intervention.'' British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher praised it as ``a courageous decision''
and said, ``Someone has to uphold democracy.''
   Former President Ronald Reagan, who had unsuccessfully tried to
force Noriega from power, said in Los Angeles, ``There comes a time
when a president must take action. That time has come.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the planning for a military
strike ``had been in existence for some time. It was one of the
first items I was briefed on'' when he took office last spring.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
of Noriega, ``As a practical matter, we have decapitated him from
the dictatorship of this country and he is now a fugitive and will
be treated as such. ... We will chase him and we will find him.''
   At Bush's suggestion, Vice President Dan Quayle called the two
newly installed Panamanian vice presidents, Billy Ford and Ricardo
Arias Calderon, to congratulate them and say he looked forward to
visiting them in a free and independent Panama, said a spokesman,
David Beckwith.
   Quayle is considered likely to attend a presidential
inauguration in Honduras on Jan. 27, and sources said a visit to
Panama then is under consideration.

   And the people who were there who may harm them know that we're
present and we're armed and we'll come after them.
   Q: General, do you plan to get dependents or other U.S.
personnel out of Panama now?
   GEN. KELLY: Not immediately. We have not implemented any plan
along those lines.
   Q: General, with some of your goals accomplished, are there any
thought _ is there any thought being given now to withdrawing some
U.S. troops?
   GEN. KELLY: My boss indicated, I think this morning, that there
were no timelines, that we were going to stay there long enough to
get the job done. I don't think I see this as a long, long-term
effort, U.S. troops in Panama, combat troops for months or years,
but I think that it's going to take a little while to help the
country get back on its feet. You've got to realize they've gone
through an awful time over the last couple of years with Noriega,
who has done a great deal to break down the social fabric of the
country, and we've got to try and help them rebuild it.
   Q: General _
   Q: Can you give an update on casualties _ an update on casualty
numbers?
   GEN. KELLY: Yeah, I can. Okay, we've lost so far four
helicopters, but three of those four will probably be _ and this is
an assertion on my part _ repairable, and the fourth one, if we get
it back _ it's in the water _ may be. And that was one Apache and
three observation helicopters. We have had 11 military people _ one
Marine, I believe, the rest soldiers _ killed, 59 wounded, and one
missing, and I mentioned the one dependent who was dead. You know,
one _ one dead American is too many, but, thank God, the numbers
don't appear too high right now.
   Q: Do you know how many of those were accidental, General?
   GEN. KELLY: To my knowledge, none of them were accidental.
   Q: General, on a scale of one to ten, how successful would you
say this operation has been so far?
   GEN. KELLY: Oh, ten. And you're asking the wrong guy.
(Laughter.) I think that it is among the most professionally
executed operations that I have seen in 33 years of military
service. Recall that the _ that the so-called war status was
declared on Friday, the Marine was killed on Saturday, the family
beating and harrassment occurred on Saturday. We made a decision,
and in almost no time at all we were putting our paratroopers and
our Rangers on airplanes and sending them down there. I don't know
that there's another country in the world that can do that. I do
know that I'm a pretty biased guy when it comes to the U.S.
military, and I think that we have the finest leaders we have
available running things in Panama.
   Q: General Kelly, following that if I could sir, in the
aftermath of Grenada, can you tell us, do you have any reports yet
of perhaps communications gear that couldn't communicate back and
forth, men dropped in the wrong place, those kinds of problems
repeating?
   GEN. KELLY: We have indications that human beings in Panama have
made mistakes, you know, history is replete with that. As far as
major glitches are concerned, Ted and I have been on the _ in the
NMCC on the communications. There has never been a second that we
haven't had direct voice communications with the commander and his
staff. In Panama, there's never been a second that they haven't
been in communication with Gen. Steiner, the Southern Task Force
Commander, JTF South, Joint Task Force South. And, no, we have not
had those kind of glitches.
   Q: Did you have any problems with any kind of weather?
   GEN. KELLY: No, no. We had weather problems, of course, up in
Fort Bragg and Pope Air Force Base trying to get out yesterday. We
had an ice storm, and we had one heck of a time getting the
airplanes de-iced, and we had problems out of Travis today with
fog; that slowed us down getting out.
   Q: General, on that point _
   GEN. KELLY: But we still made the TOTs (Time Over Target).
   Q: _ would you like to have started this operation sooner? Would
you like to have had it conducted sooner than one this morning?
   GEN. KELLY: If you could wave a magic wand and get the MAC
(Military Airlift Command) aircraft together and do all those kinds
of things, I would like it to have started just the second the
President said we could go. We were in a position where we had to
tell him that it takes so many hours to get that many airplanes
together, because they're all around the world, and we don't have
an excess number of those aircraft.
   Q: General _
   Q: General, on the amount of equipment we've thrown into this
fight in the way of planes, tanks, helicopters, what force, in
addition to manpower, are we actually bringing to bear here?
   GEN. KELLY: Reasonable force. I am a tanker. We have four tanks
in Panama, and they're Sheridans, which, as you may recall, are
light vehicles that have a 152mm gun and were originally designed
primarily to fire a Shillelagh missile. They came out of the 82nd
Airborne Division, and that's the only TO&amp;E battalion in the Army
left with the Sheridans because the M1 tanks are too heavy to be
air-dropped.

   Q: Were those flown down yesterday?
   GEN. KELLY: No, they went down sometime earlier. We also had six
Apache helicopters in Panama. That is a modern day-night
all-weather helicopter that represented a real combat multiplier.
We had some gunships, Air Force AC-130 gunships, and other
capabilities down there, all of which stood us in very good stead.
   Q: General, how many casualties from that air drop? Did we take
any?
   GEN. KELLY: I know of no casualties that occurred as a result of
the air drop.
   Q: That's a pretty hairy thing, though, to drop, what, 20
planes' worth of airborne at night?
   GEN. KELLY: Oh, no, there was a whole lot more than 20. We
wouldn't want to give you the exact number. No, 20 aircraft came
out of Fort Bragg. A whole lot more came out of other places to
carry the Rangers. Only the airborne from the 82nd came out of
Bragg.

landing zone and everything, what happened there. I mean, this was

know, that's nice and wide and open and all that.
   Q: General, what kind of problems do the Dignity Battalions pose
for you in Panama City tonight?
   GEN. KELLY: That's hard to say. You're asking me to predict the
future, and that's really an intelligence question, so I'll turn it
over to my colleague. (Laughter.)
   Q: Could we ask you, sir _
   ADM. SHEAFER: We've had _ there is some _ about 18 Dignity
Battalions. They vary in size from as few as a couple of dozen
people up to about 250. Their military training is generally pretty
inadequate.
   Q: Inadequate?
   ADM. SHEAFER: Inadequate. They're great with people who are
unarmed, but when it comes to fighting uniformed soldiers that are
well trained, they're not very good. And they are throughout many
parts of Panama City at this time. We have seen activity
principally between the areas that General Kelly mentioned, Rio
Hato in the west, and Fort Cimarron in the east by about roughly
nine of these 18 battalions. And we have seen nothing out of the
other nine.
   Q: Sir, General Kelly was telling us in the _ when he was
outlining the other units that were outside, and speaking of
Noriega forces, that there was a great deal of fleeing in the face
of the Americans. Does your intelligence suggest that will happen
in Panama City? Or are you expecting to get into a rough
street-to-street _
   ADM. SHEAFER: I'll answer _
   Q: _ (inaudible) _ which could lead to more casualties.
   ADM. SHEAFER: I'll answer the question the same way he did.
You're asking me to predict the future and that's very difficult to
do. We simply don't know.
   Q: _ like the rebellion for urban fighting when you said
   _ (inaudible).
   ADM. SHEAFER: I mean, you have to plan for the worst, and hope
for the best.
   Q: Are these guys armed? Aren't these more unarmed rebels? What
kind of weapons?
   ADM. SHEAFER: They have _ in this case we have reports that some
of the Dignity Batallions have been armed _
   Q: What kind of weapons?
   ADM. SHEAFER: With RPGs and AK-47s.
   Q: Can you give us an assessment of the difficulty it presents
to you that Noriega is still at large? The difficulty in terms of
stimulating the remaining pro-Noriega _
   ADM. SHEAFER: I don't think that's the right question. The right
question is the difficulty he has staying at large.
   Q: But you don't feel that having him at large presents you with
a different magnitude of problem because of what he represents? I
mean, as you yourself have said, he's a slippery fellow and _
   GEN. KELLY: He is, and right now Mr. Noriega commands nothing.
He has no payroll. He has no cronies except for possibly a small
group of people who are loyal to him personally because he pays
them. He does not present us with a military problem. His soldiers
did not fight any more bravely over the past day because he was
there or he wasn't there. I think now that the structure of the PDF
combat units has been reduced he is in deeper trouble. I don't
think he's deeply loved by the Panamanian people. I don't think _ I
do think that if they _ they get an inkling of where he is they're
going to _ they're going to let us know where he is or let the
authorities in Panama know where he is, because recall, that
they're the ones that did all the suffering while he was the
dictator.

   Guillermo Endara, sworn in Wednesday
as Panama's president after a U.S. invasion, remains a gentle,
unassuming law professor despite his long struggle with his enemy,
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Endara's eight-party opposition coalition united to oppose
Noriega in elections held on May 7. Noriega supporters first tried
to steal the election for his handpicked candidate, Carlos Duque,
then annulled it.
   When the vote count was halted Endara's Democratic Opposition
Alliance ticket had a 3-1 lead over Duque, according to
international observers who included former President Jimmy Carter.
   ``Our aspiration is justice, democracy and liberty,'' said
Endara in a Wednesday broadcast on a clandestine radio network. He
said that President Bush had promised U.S. troops would be removed
as early as possible.
   Opposition party officials persisted in calling Endara ``Mister
President-elect,'' maintaining that the annulment was illegal.
After Sept. 1, when Endara would have taken office, he was referred
to as ``Mister President,'' and U.S. officials followed suit.
   The staying power of Panama's opposition has always been
questioned _ Noriega said they just wanted to make money in peace
and would fold under serious challenge.
   Endara, of the Liberal Authentic Party, and his two running
mates, Ricardo Arias Calderon of the Christian Democratic Party and
Guillermo Ford of the National Liberal Republican Movement, formed
an uneasy alliance whose only unifying theme was the defeat of
Noriega.
   Arias was by far the most popular in Panama, but he was also the
most disliked by others. He clearly felt he deserved the
presidential domination but swallowed hard and took the first
vice-presidential slot.
   Second vice-presidential candidate Ford, a businessman, turned
out to be the most charismatic of the three, showing an earthy,
common touch despite his wealth as he developed a showman's style.
   One problem the three will have to surmount is the way they took
office. Many who disapproved of Noriega will also disapprove of
open, massive United States intervention, and critics say depending
on ``Big Brother'' to solve all problems is a sign of weak
character.
   The three stayed out of sight all day Wednesday. Their
statements were broadcast on a radio network anchored by Bosco
Ricardo Vallarino from ``a strategic point in Panama.'' It was
thought the point had to be on a U.S. base because Vallarino is a
well-known Noriega opponent and faced censure from Noriega
supporters.
   It was still uncertain how the tensions and compromises will
work in practice, but Endara and his running mates established
their willingness to sacrifice when men wearing Noriega's ``Dignity
Battalion'' T-shirts beat them during a May 10 protest
demonstration.
   The spectacle of Endara, Arias and Ford being beaten bloody by
pipe-wielding thugs flashed around the world in a scene that
stamped Noriega as the leader of a brutal regime. Endara spent his
53rd birthday in a hospital bed.
   ``They were not battalions and they have no dignity,'' Endara
said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied
guayabera, a short-sleeved, smock-type shirt favored by many Latins.
   He staged a hunger strike that occasioned brutal jests about
diets from pro-Noriega newspapers because of his heft.
   Endara's opposition activities date back more than two decades,
to when he served in the National Assembly under Arnulfo Arias
Madrid, Panama's grand old man of the opposition.
   He was Arias' spokesman in Panama until Arias died in Miami in
1988 in self-imposed exile. He used to speak, almost dreamily, of
the day when Arias would return ``as a sign of providence'' to lead
the country.
   Endara's wife, Marcella, died earlier this year. They had a
daughter, also named Marcella.
   Arias, 52, is president of the Christian Democratic Party. He
was a professor of philosophy at the University of Panama; he and
his wife Teresa have three children.
   Ford, 53, and his wife Dora have two children.

   Two American women were held hostage
at gunpoint in an airport terminal for more than six hours before
they were freed by U.S. soliders who bluffed the Panamanian captors
into believing that Gen. Manuel Noriega had been killed.
   Mary Rebhan, 24, of Hollywood, Fla., and Tara King, 25, of
Dallas, told reporters they were used as shields to buy time for a
group of Noriega loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customs
room at Omar Torrijos International Airport when American forces
moved in.
   ``They had us in choke holds for most of the time,'' said Rebhan.
   ``They made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to her
head,'' said King.
   The two women said they had gone to the airport Tuesday evening
to pick up Rebhan's brother, who was flying in for her wedding
ceremony at the end of the month.
   They were told his flight was delayed, and went outside to wait
in the car _ until about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday when the bombs
started to drop.
   Dashing inside the terminal, the women were accosted by a group
of about 30 armed men in civilian clothes. When it was revealed the
women were Americans, they were taken to a locked room.
   ``A guy named Sanchez was in charge,'' Rebhan said, adding that
two other men were addressed throughout the night as ``sarjinto,''
or sergeant, leading the women to believe they were members of the
Panamanian Defense Forces.
   American troops began to arrive in force to take over the
airport but the Panamanians held them off with the women.
   ``For six hours they made us keep shouting, `Go away. We're
Americans. They're going to kill us and the children if you
come,''' Rebhan said.
   Fake bombs were taped to their bodies. One was a plastic bag
stuffed with a pair of pants.
   King said their captors turned the lights off in the room to
confuse the Americans. Rebhan said Sanchez kept an Uzi machine gun
on her shoulder, pointed at the door.
   The woman, who were both raised in the canal zone, acted as
translators between the Americans and Panamanians.
   Just before dawn, the Americans set a deadline of 6:30 for the
men to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that Gen.
Noriega was already dead. In fact, Noriega's whereabouts were not
known.
   The Panamanians finally gave up, leaving the room with the women
held in front of them.
   ``They were really afraid. We could feel their hearts on our
backs as they held us,'' Rebhan said.
   But the women said they were at least equally frightened.
   ``We were terrified,'' King said. ``I thought I was going to
die.''
   Rebhan, speaking on the airport tarmac before hitching a ride
with a Pentagon press pool, said she was acting calmly because ``it
really hasn't hit me yet. I just really want to get home.''
   Rebhan, whose father is the chief mechanical engineer for the
Panama Canal, said she planned to hold a church ceremony in Panama
on Dec. 30. She was married to Jeff Rebhan in a civil ceremony in
Warren, Ohio.

   Youngsters calling Santa Claus over the past week
may have been thinking of his sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, but
they got the people who keep 530-mph, four-engine military radar
reconnaissance jets in the air.
   And most of them will never know they got the wrong number.
   The children got connected to technicians at Boeing's support
center for specially equipped military aircraft.
   ``This was quite a surprise when it started out,'' said Duane
Oberg, developer with the Airborne Warning and Control System, or
AWACS, fleet support system.
   ``But after the first several calls we figured out what had
happened, and just started answering phones as if this was Santa's
workshops.''
   Hundreds of children got their lines crossed because of
transposed numbers in a telephone listing in a national magazine,
Boeing Aerospace &amp; Electronics spokesman Elliot Pulham said
Wednesday.
   The aerospace branch of Boeing specializes in missiles,
spacecraft and spy airplanes _ for some, the ultimate toys.
   He said the calls began about Dec. 13 and were winding down by
the middle of this week, after calls for Santa were redirected.
   The first youngsters might have been greeted with, ``Hi. This is
AWACS Fleet Support Central. Can I help you?'' Pulham said. But the
engineers lightened up and played along.
   ``They were putting on their bonnets, and would play Santa
whenever the children would call, but they would give technical
information when customers called,'' he said.
   The normal phone calls to the center are for technical
assistance provided for those who fly, service and repair the AWACS
aircraft, which are loaded with sophisticated radar and other
surveillance equipment.
   There are only 60 such aircraft in operation built by Boeing,
Pulham said, and the toll-free phone line is normally not busy.
   The engineers didn't mind the distractions.
   ``It was actually kind of fun,'' Oberg said. ``Definitely a
break from what we normally do. Although I think some of our
customers were a bit surprised when they called for radar or
computer information and ended up talking to Santa's workshop.''
   Pulham said the situation didn't get out of hand, no matter what
the children might have asked for.
   ``We didn't promise anybody any cruise missiles or anything like
that for Christmas,'' he said.

<HEAD>European Community, East Germany Condemn Romania Crackdown</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Romania, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The European Community said Wednesday it was cutting back
economic relations with Romania to protest that country's crackdown
on demonstrators, and East Germany and the World Council of
Churches also issued condemnations.
   Here are some of the statements released:
   _ In Brussels, the EC Commission criticized the repression of
anti-government protests as a ``most heartless demonstration of the
abuse of human rights.''
   EC Commissioner for External Relations Frans Andriessen said a
1980 agreement covering industrial goods ``should be frozen'' and
planned visits and meetings will not be held. No new trade
concession will be made ``pending any significant improvement in
the situation.''
   The Commission also offered to help some 25,000 Romanian
refugees currently in Hungary.
   _ In East Germany, the Communist Party called on Romania's
leadership to ``stop immediately all acts of violence against its
own population'' and respect human rights.
   Another East German party leader, Lothar de Maiziere, chairman
of the Christian Democratic Union, said he feared ``genocide'' in
Romania and called for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security
Council on the situation, the state news agency ADN said.
   Young East Germans, meanwhile, staged a silent candlelight vigil
in front of the Romanian embassy in East Berlin, and an unspecified
number of students in Leipzig also protested publicly against the
crackdown, ADN said.
   _ In Geneva, leaders of the World Council of Churches and
affiliated organizations on Wednesday expressed shock at the
crackdown and said it revealed the ``ruthlessness'' of Romania's
leadership.
   ``We strongly condemn the use of violence in response to
peoples' expression of their aspirations and of their longing for
justice,'' said the statement issued at the Geneva WCC headquarters.
   The World Council comprises about 300 churches representing some
400 million Anglican, Protestant, Orthodox and other non-Roman
Catholic Christians in more than 100 countries.
   _ The U.N.'s Special Rapporteur on Summary or Arbitrary
Executions, Amos Wacko, sent an urgent cable from his Geneva office
to Romania's Foreign Ministry about the reports that hundreds of
people were killed at Timisoara last Sunday.
   Wacko ``appealed to the government of Romania to respect the
right to life of the Romanian people in accordance in particular
with the Convention on Civil and Political Rights,'' said an
official at U.N. headquarters in New York.
   _ About 150 people outraged by the reported massacres protested
outside Romania's embassy in Warsaw, Poland, on Wednesday, with
some hurling stones and bottles of ink before being stopped by
police.
   _ In Moscow, Moldavian delegates asked the Soviet Congress to
appeal for ``reason and order'' in Romania to help their ethnic
brethren there.
   _ In Israel, a firebomb was thrown at the Romanian Embassy in
Tel Aviv, causing a small fire at a nearby construction site,
Israel Television said. No injuries were reported.

   For two days, President Bush masked his plan
to oust Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega with a studied show of
business-as-usual.
   He gaily greeted guests at a White House Christmas party just
hours before the full scale military operation began.
   Outraged at the slaying of an American Marine and concerned
about quickly deteriorating conditions in Panama City, Bush decided
on Sunday to mount the assault to topple Noriega's regime,
administration officials said.
   Bush had been seriously mulling such a strike since the abortive
Oct. 3 coup attempt against Noriega, officials said. In fact, the
plan for a preemptive U.S. move against Noriega actually had been
developed months earlier.
   Sources said one of the first to learn of the go-ahead was Vice
President Dan Quayle, whom Bush briefed at a brunch on Sunday.
   The president went over final plans for the assault at a Tuesday
afternoon session with Quayle, Secretary of States James A. Baker
III, Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney, national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The Oval Office meeting, in keeping with the secrecy shrouding
the decision, was billed by White House officials as a sssion
between Bush, Cheney and Thornburgh on ``the role of the military
in the war on drugs.''
   In keeping the decision so closely under wraps, the onetime CIA
chief was following a familiar pattern of secrecy _ one also
reflected in his sending clandestine high-level missions to Beijing
and in keeping private for four months his plan for a Mediterranean
superpower summit.
   Bush attended White House Christmas parties both Monday and
Tuesday evenings, buoyantly greeting guests and posing for
photographs.
   At Tuesday's party, Scowcroft, his deputy Robert Gates and White
House Chief of Staff John Sununu all put in brief appearances
before returning to their offices to wait for the U.S. military
strike.
   A day after he made the decision to use force in an attempt to
topple Noriega, Bush refused to rule out a military response in a
Monday interview with The Associated Press and other news agencies.
He expressed ``enormous frustration'' with Noriega's continued
strong-arm tactics. But otherwise he gave no hint at what was to
come.
   The business-as-usual theme extended to other administration
officials as well on Tuesday. Public information officers at the
Pentagon went home at their regular quitting time.
   And, in the White House, presidential press secretary Marlin
Fitzwater was joined by a small group of reporters in his office to
watch evening network news accounts of unannounced U.S. troop
movements to Panama. Fitzwater said he knew nothing about the
reports.
   Fitzwater on Wednesday said the harrassment of Americans in
Panama is what finally persuaded the president to use force.
   ``The president was somber through the night (Tuesday night),
worried about the possiblity of casualties, and anxious for any
word of specific military progress.''
   Bush watched Fitzwater's announcement of the action on the
television in his study near the Oval Office, then made notes on a
5-inch by 7-inch blue notepad as he talked to various world leaders
by phone, the spokesman said.
   Bush cancelled virtually all of his scheduled events and
meetings on Wednesday so he could concentrate on the action in
Panama, receiving frequent military updates through the day and
evening.
   One event he did not cancel, Fitzwater said, was yet another
Christmas party scheduled for Wednesday evening.
   At the Pentagon, Secretary of Defense Cheney told reporters that
the order ``went out late on Sunday to implement a plan that had
been in existence for some time. It was one of the first items I
was briefed on when I became Secretary of Defense last spring.''
   Powell, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, suggested a
concern that Noriega might do something to jeopardize the Panama
Canal in the absence of a U.S. strike. And a congressional
intelligence source cited reports in recent months of a
deterioration in Noriega's mental health and heavy drinking.
   In any event, Bush, criticized in some quarters for being
indecisive and timid in failing to capitalize on last October's
coup attempt, apparently was determined not to let another
opportunity pass.
   Bush informed congressional leaders by phone of his plan about
an hour before the first shots were fired. Senate Republican Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas said Bush phoned him at 11:15 p.m. ``He said
he'd appreciate my support.'' Dole said he gave it to him.
   Bush stayed in the Oval Office until 4:05 a.m. EST, spending
much of the time phoning allied and Central American leaders to let
them know what he was doing, before heading to his personal
residence for a brief sleep before his 7 a.m. address to the nation.

   It may be the news-by-satellite era. But when
the major networks began coverage of Wednesday's U.S. military
strike in Panama shortly after midnight, the reports from their
correspondents there came by phone.
   The reason: Gunmen loyal to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriegia barred
them from a satellite transmission, network executives said. No
pictures of the U.S. attack's results or street scenes in Panama
City were seen until after 9 a.m. EST, and then they were on tape,
not live.
   NBC got embroiled in a small war of its own _ complaints from
WTN, a London-based TV news agency serving CBS, ABC and CNN, that
NBC had aired nearly four minutes of WTN footage without
permission. An NBC spokesman said that was inadvertent, and that
NBC anchor Tom Brokaw told viewers the same thing.
   But WTN president Kenneth A. Coyte, in a letter to NBC News
president Michael Gartner, protested ``in the strongest possible
terms'' NBC's action, calling it a ``cynical breach of professional
standards.''
   However, NBC officials said, all four U.S. networks shortly
afterwards agreed to pool their Panama footage. By mid-morning, the
networks simultaneously were airing long-distance night shots of
military buildings burning, white tracer bullets shooting
occasionally shooting skyward and shadowy gunmen on streets.
   The networks also aired early daytime shots of Army helicopters
landing, two Air Force C-130 transports flying several thousand
feet above Panama City's Marriott Hotel, and U.S. paratroopers,
faces daubed in dark green camouflages, taking positions near
trees, signs and parks.
   At times, the war on TV took on an Alice-in-Wonderland quality.
Brokaw, interviewing a Panama City resident by phone on the
``Today'' show, asked him what local broadcasters were reporting.
   Eloi Benedetti said he was watching reports of the U.S. strike
on the U.S. Armed Forces TV station, which also carried CNN. Brokaw
asked if the station was describing what was going on on the ground
in Panama.
   ``Well,'' Benedetti said, ``they're actually relaying the CNN
broadcast.''
   It was a risky story for correspondents _ CNN used a stringer,
Berta Thayer _ and producers. Some among the crowd of journalists
at the Marriott Hotel reported that gunmen waiting outside had
threatened them, made it too dangerous to leave the hotel.
   Four men thought to be Noriega loyalists seized two network
producers in the hotel lobby. They later released one, ABC's Robert
Campos, several hours later, ABC said. CBS said it was checking
unconfirmed reports that the other producer, Jon Meyersohn, who
worked for CBS, also had been freed.
   NBC's Ed Rabel, reporting from the Marriott, fled to a nearby
U.S. military installation after gun-waving ``goons'' threatened
his life, according to NBC News senior vice president Joseph
Angotti, running NBC's operation here.
   ``They said they didn't want him or any other gringos around,
that if they found him the next time they came around, they'll kill
him,'' Angotti said.
   The U.S. military operation against Noriega was accompanied by a
Pentagon news pool that included NBC's Fred Francis, pool reporter
for the networks. One of his reports, shown on CNN, included a
discussion with CNN anchor Bernard Shaw of what he'd seen.
   The reporters were flown in on Air Force transports, but not
early enough, one CBS executive said.
   ``We stll don't have information why the pool didn't go in with
an early wave (of soldiers), or why they were held back ... until
pretty late in the game,'' said Don Decesare, CBS' vice president
for news coverage.
   The pool system was developed after a controversy over the ban
on reporters accompanying the initial phases of the U.S. attack in
Grenada in 1982. This group's TV gear included a portable satellite
ground station.
   But even though reporters were flown around the battle areas in
helicopters, it appeared late Wednesday afternoon that unexplained
snags had developed and there'd be no pool pictures from the
transmitter, DeCesare said.
   ``They have the capacity to feed (video reports),'' he said.
``However, we still have yet to receive anything.''
   He and his NBC and ABC counterparts were relieved when, at about
35 minutes before their networks' first evening newscasts, the
pool's videotape footage began coming in from Panama. Some shots
were taken over a the shoulder of a helicopter door gunner.

   The Soviet Union used language reminiscent of the
Cold War on Wednesday to denounce the U.S. military attack in
Panama. Leaders from Europe and Latin America generally opposed the
U.S. move but said it had to be done.
   Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was one of the few
heads of state who fully supported President Bush's attempt to
capture Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. ``Someone has to uphold
democracy,'' she said.
   Angry condemnation came from Peru, where President Alan Garcia
announced he was withdrawing his ambassador from Washington until
U.S. troops leave Panama.
   Nicaragua called a military alert and asked for an emergency
meeting of the U.N. Security Council.
   Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi said the assault made Nero
and Hitler look like angels. He met the Soviet ambassador and gave
him a letter for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on the invasion,
asking Moscow to ``live up to its international responsibilities,''
Libya's official news agency JANA said.
   In Manila, Filipino congressional leaders on Thursday asked
President Corazon Aquino to recognize the ``democratically elected
government'' in Panama of Guillermo Endara, who was sworn in as
president after U.S. troops went in. On Dec. 1, U.S. jets flew air
cover to help the Manila government fight off a coup attempt.
   The official Soviet news agency Tass said of the invasion,
``This action is an example of notorious `gunboat diplomacy' which
has been used for decades by the United States in an attempt to
turn Latin American and Caribbean nations into its back yard.''
   Despite Soviet anger, Foreign Ministry spokesman Vadim P.
Perfiliev played down the impact on improved superpower relations.
   ``We are now in a situation where an event in the East or the
West is not perceived, is not evaluated, in terms of confrontation
between East and West,'' Perfiliev said in Moscow.
   But Perfiliev said the U.S. action violated U.S. charters and
``should be condemned by the international community ... (and) must
immediately stop.''
   The 12-European Economic Community did not issue a joint
statement.
   France is the current president of the community and a French
Foreign Ministry spokesman said there were no plans for a statement.
   The French government said it could not approve of the U.S.
``recourse to force'' but that it nonetheless backed the fight
against drugs and supported democratic movements everywhere.
   In London, Mrs. Thatcher said she had spoken with Bush on the
phone and told him her government supported him.
   ``Someone has to uphold democracy, there were terrible things
happening in Panama. It was a tyranny,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   ``It was a courageous decision'' to send in American troops, she
said.
   The opposition Labor Party criticized the U.S. move. In angry
exchanges later in the House of Commons it accused Mrs. Thatcher of
humiliating Britain by supporting the United States.
   Canada said the U.S. action set a ``dangerous precedent'' but
expressed sympathy.
   ``What would you have us do?'' asked Canadian Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney. ``Here you've got a drug runner and thug running
the country. He declares war on the United States. He assassinates
some innocent American citizens.''
   Among other Western allies, the Dutch government said it also
sympathized with Bush, but Spain, which has close ties throughout
Latin America, ``deeply lamented'' the U.S. move.
   Venezuela summed up many reactions by saying it opposed the
intervention but also opposed Noriega's regime.
   During a meeting of regional leaders in Colombia, Venezuela
blamed a ``lack of an effective and firm response by our
countries'' in the past for the situation in Panama.
   The Organization of American States, which has tried to pressure
Noriega to step down, convened an emergency meeting in Washington
at which the Panamanian delegate, Jose Maria Cabrera, called on the
group to condemn the ``brutal and criminal aggression.''
   ``It is not possible, while Panamanian citizens are still being
massacred without distinction of age, sex or status for this
organization to keep its arms crossed,'' he said.
   China made no overt comment. Its official Xinhua News Agency
issued brief reports that said Noriega was ``safe'' and would
``fight for the nation's sovereignty.''
   Japan was noncommittal. Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama said in
Tokyo he hoped the confrontation would end soon and a democratic
government take over in Panama.
   Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper said in an editorial prepared
for Thursday's editions ``it is highly questionable that the global
community will buy'' the U.S. explanation for its action.
   ``The difference in strength between America and Panama is like
that between an elephant and an ant. The United States should not
be surprised if its advance into Panama is regarded by the rest of
the world as a blatant invasion of Panama's independence and
sovereignty.''
   In Iran, official Tehran radio said the United States wanted to
replace Noriega with a government acceptable to itself ``so as to
continue its domination over the (Panama) Canal and its arrogant
hegemony over central and south America.''
   Gadhafi, who has been accused by official Washington in the past
of promoting international terrorism, said of the U.S. action, ``I
could not find any expression in the dictionary to describe the
degree of anger toward the savagery of official terrorism and
powermania.''
   He said the assault makes ``Nero and Hitler angels compared to
the western Mongols and Nazis of the Americans and their allies,''
JANA reported, monitored in Rome.

   Phoenix police officer Russell E. Dean was
staring down the barrel of his own revolver, held by a 16-year-old
who threatened to kill him after being stopped for speeding, when a
passerby intervened.
   John W. Basey stopped his car, grabbed the assailant, pulled him
off the policeman and then found himself facing the cocked and
loaded gun.
   Basey, a 40-year-old window washer, was one of 20 people honored
Wednesday by the Pittsburgh-based Carnegie Hero Fund Commission for
risking their lives attempting to save others. Unlike Basey, some
of them were honored posthumously.
   Those honored, each of whom receives a $2,500 cash reward and a
medal, bring to 111 the number recognized this year. The
organization has honored 7,405 Americans and Canadians since
industrialist Andrew Carnegie established the commission in 1904.
   Dean said Wednesday the 16-year-old he chased last July reached
speeds of 80 mph on Phoenix's streets before crashing his car into
a tree.
   When Dean stopped to apprehend the boy, the youth turned on the
motorcycle officer and fell on him. The boy pulled Dean's
.38-caliber pistol from his holster.
   ``He put the gun right to my left eye and he said he was going
to kill me,'' Dean said.
   Then Basey arrived. ``Mr. Basey walked right up in the face of
that gun that could have gone off at any time,'' Dean said. ``I
believe Mr. Basey saved my life.''
   Basey talked the 16-year-old into releasing the gun, and Dean
handcuffed the boy and arrested him. Dean suffered only a sprained
knee and scrapes.
   Also recognized Wednesday were:
   _Derek Lambert, 16, of Andrews, S.C., who saved a man who had
fallen from a boat and severely cut his hands on the propeller on
Oct. 9, 1988.
   _Milton E. Bradford, 32, of Newport, N.J., who died saving a
co-worker who was overcome by gas in a sewer shaft on Sept. 6, 1988.
   _Shirley Belle Viscusi, 58, Howick, Quebec, a nurse who died
trying to save a woman who suffocated in a home for the elderly
that had caught fire on July, 25, 1988.
   _Michael B. LaRiviere, 18, Rockaway, Ore., who died while
swimming to save a man caught in an ocean current on July 30.
   _Martin A. Benfield, 27, Lenoir, N.C., who nearly drowned
pulling two young boys out of the ocean after they had gotten into
water over the heads on June 14, 1988.
   _Leonard A. Theroux, 65, Chepachet, R.I., who pulled a man from
his burning auto before the vehicle became engulfed in flames on
Feb. 18.
   _Aaron Lorne Clark, 25, Magdalen Islands, Quebec, who drowned
while helping to save a 13-year-old girl in the Gulf of St.
Lawrence on Aug. 21, 1986.
   _Jerry L. Conrad, 35, Toledo, Ohio, who leaped into a moving car
to save a 2-year-old girl on Sept. 23, 1987.
   _Jerry O. Anderson, 35, Tulsa, Okla., who drowned while saving a
12-year-old boy who had fallen from a dam into deep water on May 27.
   _Allen N. Davidson, 13, Gaffney, S.C., who crawled into a
burning house and dragged an elderly woman to safety on Nov. 19,
1988.
   _Michael Ollins, 33, Chicago, a bus driver who left his vehicle
and stopped a group of young men from beating a man on a crowded
city street on Aug. 20, 1987.
   _Claude Cleroux, 50, Montreal; Serge Perron, 38, Repentigny,
Quebec; and Robert K. Myles, 37, St. Hillaire, Quebec, all of whom
helped save a co-worker trapped beneath a crumbling wall after an
explosion in an oil refinery on December 16, 1986.
   _Scott Walter Asson, 20, Burley, Idaho, who broke a car window
and pulled a woman free just before the car was submerged in a
flooded wash in Scottsdale, Ariz., on Oct. 14, 1988.
   _Donat Pelletier, 43, and Guy Bernier, 41, both of Ste.
Felicite, Quebec; and Denis Blanchet, 42, and Rejean Miville, 35,
both of St. Pamphile, Quebec, who crossed the partially frozen
surface of the St. John River to rescue a co-worker trapped in a
bridge that was carried downstream April 1, 1986.

<HEAD>`Blackbird' Spy Plane Observes 25th Anniversary of Maiden Flight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURBANK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Lockheed Aircraft Corp.
employees watched an SR-71 Blackbird thunder overhead Wednesday as
the spy plane flew toward retirement after nearly 25 years of
top-secret, supersonic service.
   Among the Lockheed workers watching the flybys near the Burbank
airport and a Lockheed research and development facility near Santa
Clarita was Clarence ``Kelly'' Johnson, 79, Lockheed's legendary
aircraft designer.
   Johnson, who is in poor health, has been living at an
undisclosed hospital, said Richard Stadler, a Lockheed spokesman.
   The black, delta-winged reconnaissance jet, which is heading for
retirement under Pentagon cutbacks, was first flown on Dec. 22,
1964, said Bill Spaniel, a Lockheed spokesman.
   Spaniel declined to give further details about the maiden
flight, saying that much information about the
intelligence-gathering aircraft remains classified.
   It was the first time many people had seen the black,
sophisticated aircraft, even among Lockheed employees, said
Stadler, who watched three flybys in Burbank from the roof of a
Lockheed building.
   ``It's amazing,'' Stadler said. ``Some of us get used to the
fact of the aircraft being around, and then you realize that a lot
of people have never seen one before.''
   The SR-71 was developed to succeed the U-2 spy plane, which came
to symbolize the Cold War after American pilot Francis Gary Powers
was shot down in 1960 during a reconnaissance flight high above the
Soviet Union.
   Like the U-2, the Blackbird was conceived by engineers working
at Lockheed's Advanced Development Projects, a highly innovative
program organized by Johnson that gained renown as the Skunk Works.
   Blackbirds on reconnaissance flights were frequently targeted by
ground-to-air missiles and jet interceptors during the Vietnam War,
Lockheed officials said.
   But attempts to shoot down Blackbirds have all failed, primarily
because the jet was able to outrun its attackers at speeds three
times faster than the speed of sound and was able to fly at
altitudes higher than 85,000 feet, officials said.
   While many of the SR-71's exact capabilities have remained
secret, it has held several speed and altitude records for nearly a
quarter century.
   One public record held by a Blackbird was a 15,000-mile flight
completed in 10{ hours, which works out to a speed of about 1,429
mph. Background material provided by Lockheed, however, says the
twin-engine jet is capable of speeds in excess of 2,000 mph.
   The capability of radar, infrared cameras and other
intelligence-gathering sensors aboard the SR-71 also is classified.
However, officials have acknowledged that the pictures produced by
such equipment are sharp enough that one can read the numbers on a
license plate photographed from 15 miles away.

<HEAD>WASHN: the dictator.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Q: Excuse me, General. What _
   ADM. SHEAFER: Let me add one thing to what he said. The comments
he made about payday should not be taken lightly. When you retire
from the PDF after 26 years of service, you retire on 100 percent
of your salary.
   Q: General, I know you said you don't like making predictions,
but how long do you think this mop-up operation will take? And what
role do you see the U.S. military playing down in Panama _ say,
over the next one to two weeks?
   GEN. KELLY: I would say that the mop-up is difficult to figure.
We had hoped to be able to have it done within about three days.
The role we will play is assisting the Panamanians who are a
sovereign state and have a President now who will begin to
function, I'm certain, in maintaining order initially and
recapturing control of their institutions like the police. You
know, the Panamanian police are no different now than they were
before. I think they have to get organized and get decent
leadership, but they can go back out and maintain order.
   Q: Excuse me, if I can follow up. Will U.S. soldiers be playing
a police function down there after the mop-up?
   GEN. KELLY: That's conceivable. We have some MPs down there.
They have police training, and we may have to assist the
Panamanians for as short a period of time as possible. That's a
policy decision _ that's not my decision, and then _ and we'll get
guidance on it.
   Q: It's always been presumed, General Kelly, that the area
outside the city of Panama, along the Costa Rican border, has been
the most friendly towards Noriega, and it's always been speculated
that if he got into trouble, he would run into that area. Have you
secured that area?
   GEN. KELLY: We _ we're not going to tell you everything that
we've done, but the preponderance of our forces right now in the
areas that I laid out for you initially where the major combat
elements of the PDF are _ I think that the _ the first thing we
felt we had to do was take on the PDF regular units in the vicinity
of the capital, and to assist the Panamanian people, the vast
majority of whom live there, as you know, in reestablishing their
democracy and supporting the duly elected government of the
country. When that's done _ and hopefully, that won't take too long
_ we'll then have opportunities to do other things, possibly.
   Q: General, is _ (inaudible) _ still going on at this point in
the country?
   GEN. KELLY: Right now _ I just checked before we walked over
here _ and not very much. As I said, in the airborne area _ and
they got in late a little bit because of the bad weather _ they
finished off their job this afternoon, were going in late this
afternoon up to Fort Cimarron to check on Battalion 2000, and found
they weren't even there. So, in terms of major fighting going on
right now, there is none.
   Q: General, what about _
   Q: General, what _ General _ excuse me _ when were the _ two
questions. When were the Shermans taken down to Panama? And the
other question is, the U.S. representatives had contact with some
of the Noriega opposition people before the Force went down. Was
there any contact with PDF people thought to be sympathetic?
   GEN. KELLY: To answer your first question first, when was the
Shermans taken down? Some time ago. But not a long time ago.
   Q: A month, or _
   GEN. KELLY: Maybe about that. And the reason I don't give you
specific data is because I don't remember it, but it's in that
ballpark. In terms of contacts with anybody, he didn't, I didn't,
and nobody I know did. We had a mission to go down and that's what
we did.
   Q: Well, I mean, the people in the embassy told the pool this
morning that they had had contacts with some of the political
opposition I guess Monday.
   GEN. KELLY: They _ they may well have, but what I was told to do
was get the 82nd and the Rangers and the others ready to go, and
that's what _ that's what we did.
   Q: General, what about reports that Noriega may be either in
Nicaragua or Cuba or he may have fled the country, and what would
that do to your efforts to capture him?
   GEN. KELLY: If he's gone to Cuba or Nicaragua, it'd obviously
slow our efforts down a little bit, I guess. (Laughter.) It _
   Q: Can you tell me if he's in _ that he's in Panama?
   GEN. KELLY: We think he is.
   ADM. SHEAFER: We have no reason to believe that he's outside of
Panama.
   GEN. KELLY: If Noriega's left Panama, by the way, he's utterly
without influence. You know, former dictators are not the same as
elder statesmen. He's liable to sit on some beach until somebody
stops by to say hello to him. (Laughter.)
   Q: General, are the Apaches normally based in Panama?
   Q: (Inaudible) _ Tactical Air Command _
   GEN. KELLY: Sir?
   Q: Are the the Apaches normally based in Panama and could you
describe how the other helicopters were brought down?
   GEN. KELLY: Well, the Apaches are not normally based in Panama
and the helicopters were all brought down in larger airplanes,
generally C-5s.

   Q: When did that happen?
   GEN. KELLY: The Apaches went down, oh, two weeks ago.
   Q: General _
   Q: And how were the other aircraft shot down?
   GEN. KELLY: Which other aircraft?
   Q: (Inaudible.)
   GEN. KELLY: Groundfire. Mostly groundfire. In one case, one hit
a wire. I think the other three were groundfire, weren't they _
   Q: Small arms _
   GEN. KELLY: Pretty much, yeah.
   Q: Small arms, rockets?
   ADM. SHEAFER: Small arms, to the best of our knowledge.
   Q: General, you said at the beginning that you did not find any
evidence that any attack was being planned on the Canal. Had you
expected to find some?
   GEN. KELLY: We had to be prepared for that. You know, the Canal
is one of the major reasons that we're in Panama. The treaty gives
us the right to protect and defend the Canal, so that's a duty that
we have. Incidentally, all of my bosses understand clearly that
we're going to adhere meticulously to the provisions of that
treaty, and that's part of the basis that we went down. So yeah, we
were very concerned about it. And if you put the Panama Canal out
of business for a couple of years, that would represent an economic
difficulty in the military.
   Q: General _
   Q: When will the reinforcements arrive?
   GEN. KELLY: Which reinforcements?
   Q: The 2,500 you're sending down of military police.
   GEN. KELLY: The 7th Infantry Division should be completed
sometime tonight. The reason I say that is there is fog up at
Travis, and when we can get them out is a little bit difficult to
predict. But right now, we've got 31 airplanes for them; 21 are in
the air. The MPs left this morning, starting at eight, to the tune
of one airplane per hour, so there were 25 airplanes. And I sat
down and figured that out _ took a little while _ but about 25
hours will put them in there sometime. And I think we'll even beat
that, so, say, 7:15 tomorrow morning _
   Q: General, have you heard anything about Costa Rica offering
sanctuary to Noriega if he crosses over and lays down his arms?
   GEN. KELLY: I have not.
   Q: General, did you have difficulty getting control of the radio
station that was continually broadcasting for Noriega?
   GEN. KELLY: We didn't have difficulty getting control of it
because we weren't trying to get control of it. We had difficulty
getting it off the air. We are still working on that, and we expect
to be successful very shortly.
   Q: How are you doing that? Can you describe that?
   GEN. KELLY: I can't tell you how we plan to do it, but we plan
to do it.
   Q: Could you give us a little better breakdown on the
casualties? We heard earlier firefights at the Comandancia. Was it
also at Rio Hato _
   GEN. KELLY: Firefights went on here at Rio Hato. We sent our
troops in well-armed and superbly trained. And I know that sounds
like bragging, but that's just the truth; they were. So they're at
an advantage with almost anybody else anywhere. And the Rangers, of
course, went in at Rio Hato. They had TACAIR assisting them right
before they went in. There wasn't _
   Q: What kind of TACAIR?
   GEN. KELLY: I'm not going to say, but we had TACAIR there. The
Marines didn't have major enemy forces in their area. Their vital
and key job was to keep the Bridge of the Americas open, which, of
course, is the lifeline in Panama. The fighting up here in the
airborne area turned out to be stiff in places, but overall not all
that difficult _ witness Battalion 2000 not putting up much of a
fight. I don't think we had too much trouble down here with the
Cavalry squadron, the Panama Vieja.
   The fighting around the Comandancia initially was probably as
stiff as any that we ran into, but when we finally went into it
this afternoon, it had been unoccupied; they had left. I think one
of the reasons that the casualties were as low as they were was
that we _ we had well-trained soldiers, we had the helicopter
gunships, we had the AC-130s, which is an airforce gunship which is
extremely accurate. And we took advantage of the tools that we had
in order to protect our soldiers, and sailors, and airmen, and
Marines.
   MR. WILLIAMS: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. We need
to get _ we need to get General Kelly back to the command post. Let
me just make two notes here. First of all about your question about
contacts with people, obviously there were contacts with the people
that have now been _ now taken over as the duly elected leaders of
Panama. They were clearly contacted before the operation and said
they supported it. As Secretary Cheney and I think General Powell
said this morning, they already answered the question about contact
with the PDF, and the answer is no. As to Mr. Engberg's questions
about our knowledge of people in the hotel, we're well aware of
that. The Secretary is aware of it. I think General Kelly referred
to that early on. So we are clearly aware of the situation.
   Thank you all very much.
   Q: (Off mike) _ if there's any word? Will there be another
briefing?
   MR. WILLIAMS: Not today.

   Police arrested 118 people including musicians
Kris Kristofferson and Jackson Browne and actor Martin Sheen at a
demonstration Wednesday against U.S. support for El Salvador's
rightist government.
   Those arrested were among 500 demonstrators outside the downtown
federal building, where protesters have since mid-November gathered
each Wednesday morning to block entrances.
   ``I'm opposed to U.S. military aid to the (Alfredo) Cristiani
government, a right-wing terror-death squad government. It has been
going on for a long time,'' said Kristofferson as he sat down in
front of the building.
   Also sitting with Kristofferson was Sheen, who has been arrested
at previous demonstrations at the building.
   Browne was part of a group that briefly got into a shoving match
with police when the group briefly blocked a federal police parking
lot nearby, but returned to the federal building.
   ``We decided not to be arrested there because we would be
arrested by city police and separated from the group,'' Browne
explained.
   The building and its perimeter are under the jurisdiction of
U.S. Protective Service police. Demonstrators are arrested for
blocking access to a federal building, a $25 infraction.
   The demonstrations began after leftist rebels began a series of
attacks against the Cristiani government beginning in mid-November.
Those incidents have dwindled in recent weeks.

<TEXT>
   Friends and relatives of the 270
people killed on Pan Am Flight 103 gathered in this small Scottish
town Wednesday, the eve of the first anniversary of the bombing, to
join residents in mourning.
   One year ago Thursday, the New York-bound Boeing 747 exploded
over Lockerbie, killing all 259 passengers and crew members. Fiery,
molten wreckage fell 31,000 feet, killing another 11 people on the
ground.
   Dec. 21, 1988 _ the shortest day of the year _ became the
longest for the suddenly bereaved, for the town of 3,500 people
jolted into disaster, and for the rescuers who would give up their
Christmas to search for bodies, wreckage and clues.
   Residents of Lockerbie hope that once Thursday's anniversary
passes, they can get on with their lives and return to quiet
obscurity.
   A group of American relatives in Lockerbie for the anniversary
presented a memorial plaque to Councilman Hugh Young at the town
hall Wednesday night.
   ``There were times when we lost our faith in fellow man,'' said
Joe Horgan of Philadelphia, a board member of The Victims of Pan Am
Flight 103, a relatives' support group.
   ``But you only have to come here to have it restored. This town
was devastated itself. These people reached out in the midst of our
own devastation and guided us,'' said Horgan, whose brother-in-law
was on the flight.
   Another plaque made of three slabs of gray Finnish granite
inscribed with all 270 victims' named will be dedicated Thursday at
a new Garden of Remembrance in Dryfesdale Cemetery outside
Lockerbie.
   On Thursday night, about the time the world learned of the
disaster last year, an ecumenical service will be held outside the
Lockerbie Town Hall that a year ago became a makeshift morgue.
   Organizers have kept both remembrance services simple, and no
formal invitations have been issued.
   U.S. Ambassador Henry Catto and his wife, Jessica, will attend
the plaque dedication, the U.S. Embassy said.
   Pan Am said only about two dozen relatives accepted its offer to
fly them to the services. The airline is not sending an official
representative to Lockerbie, but some employees were expected to
attend in a private capacity, said a Pan Am spokesman in New York.
   ``The majority of families, and particularly the leadership of
the families of 103, plan to remain in the United States,'' he
said, referring to The Victims of Pan Am Flight 103.
   Bert Ammerman, whose brother, Thomas, died on the flight and who
heads the group, said some relatives planned to attend a public
memorial service in Washington on Thursday, while others would go
into seclusion.
   ``Most people wish it would go Dec. 20th to the 22nd and forget
the 21st because the 21st ... is, for I don't know how long, for
some people going to bring back just an awful, awful remembrance of
that particular day,'' he said in a British television documentary,
``The Road to Damascus,'' shown Wednesday.
   The U.S. consulate in Edinburgh said some relatives of victims
decided against coming after the State Department warned last week
of possible activity by Middle East terrorists during the holiday
season.
   Police heading the international manhunt for the Flight 103
bombers have confirmed that one focus of their investigation is the
Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,
Ahmed Jibril's radical Syrian-based faction.
   Jibril has denied involvement, but acknowledged his group has
used devices similar to the plastic explosives concealed in a
radio-cassette player that blew the jumbo jet apart.
   Chief Constable George Esson of the Dumfries and Galloway
Constabulary says the bomb suitcase was either checked in at
Frankfurt Airport, where the flight originated, or passed through
Frankfurt from a feeder flight. West German authorities say there's
not enough evidence to pinpoint where the bomb originated.
   The only scar remaining in Lockerbie, 15 miles north of the
English border, is a muddy vacant lot on Sherwood Crescent. The
main part of the plane's fuselage, with enough fuel for the
trans-Atlantic journey, exploded on the crescent, destroying 26
homes.
   The 30-foot-deep crater has been filled in, and 10 homes are to
be built on the site. A mile away in Park Place and Rosebank, where
more than 60 bodies fell from the plane, one house has been rebuilt
and 70 renovated.
   Maxwell Kerr, chairman of Rosebank Residents' Association, spoke
of ``a tension in the town'' as the anniversary approached.
   ``There's the feeling that there was last year. It is all
brought back by the media,'' he said.
   Several residents recently attended a course on how to deal with
the media influx.
   ``The coverage we are getting with the anniversary looming
doesn't really help. It builds up pressure,'' said Robert Riddet,
one of them who attended the course. ``It brings back memories.
Everyone in Lockerbie on the night was affected in some way. But we
are fighting back. The scars are healing both in the people and the
town.''

<HEAD>Noriega's Pen Pal `Disappointed' by U.S. Invasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEGAUNEE, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. invasion of Panama on Wednesday
upset the 12-year-old pen pal to Panama's deposed Gen. Manuel
Noriega.
   ``I'm really disappointed about what our two governments are
doing and I feel for the safety of Panamanian and United States
soldiers,'' Sarah York said in an interview with Marquette
television station WLUC.
   The schoolgirl said she was worried about the safety of Noriega,
who went into hiding when U.S. troops attacked.
   ``I hope that he's doing OK and nothing bad will happen to
him,'' she said. ``He's very nice and intelligent and seems like
the kind of person someone can trust. He never let me down and I
feel like I can trust him.''
   Sarah struck up a correspondence with Noriega following his 1988
indictment on U.S. drug charges. She has visited the dictator
twice, first as his guest last year, then in October on her own.
   Her parents, criticized for allowing the visits, condemned the
invasion.
   ``We are a family among the American people who support the
Panamanians in their struggle for self-determination and
sovereignty,'' Pauline York said in a recorded telephone message at
her home.
   ``We join the people and the nations of the world in calling on
the president and his military to end this invasion. To the
Panamanian people: Todo por la patria,'' which means ``all for the
motherland,'' the recording said.
   Sarah's father, prison guard Mitchell York, questioned U.S.
motives for the invasion.
   ``Do you think it's worth American lives to go after one man?''
he asked. ``Do you think it's worth alienating the entire
hemisphere against us for political vanity?''
   During Sarah's last visit, nine days after the October coup
attempt, Noriega called Sarah a ``meritorious daughter'' of Panama.
She said then she feared for Noriega if he ever was brought to the
United States.
   ``They probably won't even listen to him on trial,'' she said.
``They will just put him in jail.''
   The United States has tried to oust Noriega with economic and
political pressure since his February 1988 indictment. U.S.
sanctions depressed the economy, but did not budge Noriega. Two
attempts at coups failed.
   Sarah York went to school as usual Wednesday, but her parents
told officials to keep reporters away from the girl, said Negaunee
Middle School spokeswoman Mary Grober.
   The City Council has rejected Mrs. York's requests that the
Upper Peninsula mining town declare a sister city in Panama. City
Manager John Korhonen said the council did not want to get involved
with a hostile regime.

<HEAD>Tennessee Secretary of State Dies From Dec. 12 Gunshot Wound</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Secretary of State Gentry Crowell, who
shot himself in the head last week as a corruption probe tightened
around his office, died Wednesday after doctors declared him
brain-dead.
   Crowell, who was not implicated personally in the investigation,
had been in a coma since shooting himself once with a .38-caliber
revolver at his home Dec. 12.
   His condition worsened Tuesday night as tests showed a
restricted blood flow to the brain. Final tests showed little blood
flow, and doctors decided Wednesday to remove him from life-support
systems, said Dr. Joseph C. Ross, an associate vice chancellor at
Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
   ``He essentially was found to have no brain function,'' Ross
said. ``It was comparable to an extensive or massive stroke.''
   Crowell, 57, never regained consciousness after the shooting. He
had remained in critical condition and was treated with intravenous
injections of a drug designed to remove fluids from the brain and
reduce swelling.
   Gov. Ned McWherter issued a statement of condolence to Crowell's
family, who were at the hospital when he died at 1:19 p.m.
   ``This is a sad and unfortunate time for his wife, Terrijean,
and their children, Melissa, Chris and Brooks,'' McWherter said.
   James W. Simmons was appointed by McWherter on Tuesday to fill
Crowell's role until the Jan. 9 convening of the Legislature, which
can appoint a successor.
   Controversy, much of it growing out of his passionate devotion
to the Democratic Party, followed Crowell during most of his 18
years in state government.
   He was once known as ``The Godfather'' on Capitol Hill because
of his absolute, partisan control over legislation in the dual
roles of chairman of the House Democratic Caucus and the House
Calendar Committee.
   As secretary of state, he was in charge of regulating bingo and
spending by lobbyists and political campaigns, all of which were
involved in the federal-state investigation into public corruption.
   He testified in September and November 1989 before federal grand
juries in Nashville and Memphis investigating bingo corruption in
Tennessee. He said he was told by federal agents that he was not a
target of the investigation.
   As a result of the probe one former Crowell aide, former chief
bingo inspector W.D. ``Donnie'' Walker, has gone to federal prison
in Alabama; his longtime aide, Mary Sue Wright, has been named an
unindicted co-conspirator and given immunity from prosecution.
   Ms. Wright kept the books on a campaign fund started by Crowell
and two other constitutional officers on behalf of Democratic
candidates for the Legislature. She admitted taking thousands of
dollars from the fund, and a federal grand jury in Memphis has
subpoenaed records from it.
   The secretary of state's office had regulated charitable bingo
since it was legalized for charity fund-raising in 1971. It did not
become controversial, however, until 1979, when the Legislature
outlawed bingo on the final day of the session.
   After protracted negotiations between the House and Senate, the
game was made legal again in 1980 and the Office of Charitable
Solicitations was put in charge. Every year thereafter, the
Legislature amended the bingo law in an effort to weed out
professional gambling.
   In October 1987, Crowell revoked the bingo license for a
Kingsport AmVets post on grounds the group gave little of its
profits to charity. The case was appealed up to the state Supreme
Court, which ruled bingo an unconstitutional lottery in February
1989.

   Only a few blips registered on financial markets Wednesday as
investors took the U.S. invasion of Panama in stride.
   The dollar, oil and many stocks moved higher on the news of the
surprise U.S. military operation, but prices later receded amid the
usual concerns about interest rates and the economy.
   ``The initial reaction is one of a non-event,'' said Dennis E.
Jarrett, a stock analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. in New York.
``It might have an impact if it becomes a prolonged situation.''
   President Bush ordered troops into Panama following several days
of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a U.S.
military officer by defense forces controlled by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average, a key
barometer of financial reaction to outside events, closed down 7.68
points to the 2,687.93, following an initial rise. Stocks advancing
in price narrowly outnumbered declining issues on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Analysts said the Panama confrontation's economic effects were
unclear, but investors remain worried about the health of the U.S.
economy in general.
   Most experts did not view the Panamanian situation as a reason
for making big changes in their investment strategies.
   ``We've been involved in limited engagements before. This looks
like a military engagement that will be over shortly,'' said Larry
Wachtel, a vice president for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   Some analysts said they looked upon the assault as generally
positive because it showed the Bush administration meant business.
   ``I think people are encouraged by the forceful action by our
government,'' said Michael Metz, a technical analyst with New
York-based Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``But there's a lot of anxieties on
Wall Steet ... worries about the real estate market and a looming
recession.''
   In another sign that the economy was dominating investor
thinking, some U.S. Treasury bond prices moved slightly higher in
late New York trading after the Federal Reserve signaled it might
lower interest rates. The prospect of lower rates on government
issues often spurs demand for existing bonds, pushing prices higher.
   Speculation about lower rates also helped depress the dollar in
foreign exchange trading.
   The U.S. currency initially rallied on the news of the Panama
action because in times of international tension investors buy
dollars and precious metals as safe havens for their money.
   The dollar closed sharply higher in Tokyo, but was mixed in
Europe and New York.
   Gabriele Schmitt, a trader with the Bank of New York, said the
dollar still had room to rise because of the uncertainty in Panama.
   ``There are still a lot of question marks,'' she said. ``Noriega
still has a lot of support in his country ... I wouldn't rule him
out entirely.''
   Gold prices were not affected significantly by the Panama news
but managed to finish slightly higher in New York trading.
   The oil futures market initially rallied, but prices fell back
later in the day.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was
down 7 cents to settle at $21.21 per 42-gallon barrel.
   The January home heating oil contract, supported in recent days
from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation, was up 0.75 cent to
settle at 75.76 cents a gallon.
   ``I think the reaction to the Panama closure was totally
irrational,'' Bob Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache,
said of the early rally.
   Prices jumped over concern that the closing of the Panama Canal
might disrupt oil shipments. But as most analysts noted only a
small percentage of crude shipped to the United States passes
through the Panama Canal.

<HEAD>Panama &amp; Its Canal: A Boon to World Trade, Headache for Panama</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELOY O. AGUILAR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALBOA HEIGHTS, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panama Canal, a crowning
achievement of U.S. industry and energy, has been a boon for world
trade, a symbol of achievement for Americans and a source of dismay
for many Panamanians.
   ``The canal has been good and bad for us,'' said historian
Carlos Bolivar Pedreschi in an interview with The Associated Press
earlier this year.
   ``It helped us attain independence and created an efficient
class of administrators. But then the United States also created
and supported a Panamanian military class that, claiming it must
prepare to protect the canal, has suppressed the democratic
forces,'' Pedreschi said.
   The canal was closed for the first time in many years on
Wednesday after the beginning of the U.S. attack that ousted the
most recent representative of that military class, Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   It had been closed before, but only because of landslides in the
narrow Gaillaird Cut. The Canal Commission, headquartered at Balboa
Heights above the southern end of the canal, hoped to have the
canal open for business on Thursday, but it wasn't clear if it
would be safe.
   The United States helped Panama secede from Colombia in 1903,
with President Theodore Roosevelt serving as godfather, and paid
the French, who started work on the canal, $40 million for rights
and properties, then spent $387 million and ten years building it.
   Linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and cutting sailing time
around Cape Horn by more than half, the waterway was a marvel of
engineering from the start. Nearly 262 million cubic yards of dirt
and rock were removed, enough to fill a train circling Earth four
times.
   Since then, dredges have dug out nearly 400 million more cubic
yards to widen it and keep the 51-mile-long waterway in running
condition.
   An estimated 36,000 workers were employed at the peak of the
enterprise, and they built dams and locks, conquered yellow fever
and malaria and sawed through Gold Hill, now the peak of Culebra
Cut, also known as the Gailliard Cut for its chief engineer.
   In order to negotiate the waterway, ships are lifted 85 feet
from one ocean and deposited again in the other through the locks,
whose level rises or descads depending on the ship's direction.
   The cuts the route from, for example, Peru to the East Coast by
6,200 miles, and the cost is not exhorbitant: $1.83 per cargo ton
in 1989; $1.46 per ton unloaded. Adventurer Richard Halliburton,
weighing 140 pounds, paid 36 cents to swim it in the 1920s.
   But adventure and commerce were not the only meaning of the
canal. It had quite another meaning to men like Noriega's mentor,
the late dictator Omar Torrijos, who made it their historic project
to recover the Canal Zone.
   The zone was an affluent little America, 10 miles on each side
of the waterway, replete with manicured lawns, its own courts,
police, stamps, stores and lifestyle.
   The treaty that created the Zone, a 10-mile wide domain of U.S.
sovereignty that cut Panama in two, was considered unfair even by
John Hay, the U.S. Secretary of State who arranged it, but it
helped convince Congress to spend the money to build the canal.
   Over the years, highly paid American canal employees and
military personnel living caused increasing resentment among poorly
paid Panamanians _ especially blacks, who faced Southern-style
segregation.
   In 1964, riots over what flags should fly at Balboa High School
left four U.S. soldiers and 22 Panamanians dead.
   The Panama Canal Treaties, signed in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter and Torrijos, eliminated the Canal Zone and called for the
United States to give up all rights to the canal it built and
maintained at noon on Dec. 31, 1999.
   When Torrijos died in a plane accident in 1981, an obscure
military intelligence officer whom he had befriended began to work
himself up the ladder of power. In 1983, he became head of the
Defense Forces.
   The treaty, the Canal and compliance became one of many bones of
contention between the United States and Panama during Noriega's
stint as leader of Panama.

   WASHINGTON (AM) _ The Soviet Union is supporting democracy by
not interfering in other countries while the United States, this
time, is supporting democracy by sending troops into another
country, Secretary of State James A. Baker III noted Wednesday.
   In discussing the Soviet criticism of the U.S. attack on the
forces of dictator Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, Baker said:
   ``Let me say that I think both the United States and the Soviet
Union today are supporting democracy. At least that's what
President Gorbachev told President Bush at Malta when he said he
had a little problem with the use of the word democratic _ I mean,
`Western values,' so we agreed that we would you use the term
`democratic values.'
   ``The difference is that the Soviet Union supports democracy by
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to proceed.
In this one and very unique instance, the United States did it by
going in to assist a democratically elected government against a
dictator.''
   There have been many reports from Eastern Europe crediting
Gorbachev's refusal to support local Communist parties for the
dramatic emergence of non-Communist governments in several capitals.
   Noriega overturned the results of an election this year in which
Panama citizens voted for Guillermo Endara for president on May 7.
Noriega-formed ``Dignity Battalions'' beat opposition candidates in
the streets.

   A Marine killed in Wednesday's U.S. invasion of Panama had been
eager ``to get on with the job they were there to do,'' and
relatives of a slain soldier who remained in the Army despite their
pleas say they are angry.
   ``My own opinion, I think it was stupid,'' said Andriana Perez,
sister of Cpl. Ivan D. Perez, who died during the U.S. strike in
Panama. ``My father is very, very angry. We don't know how we feel
right now.''
   Perez, 22, of Pawtucket, R.I., had been in the Army for four
years, and his sister Adriana said he couldn't have been happier.
   He loved it so much, she said, that when he lost his sight in
one eye last year, the Army offered him an honorable discharge.
   ``He wanted to keep going,'' she said. ``We told him to get out,
he had a chance. He just really enjoyed being there. Ever since he
was a little kid, he wanted to be a soldier.''
   Paratroopers' wives, meanwhile, were told their husbands
wouldn't be home by Christmas.
   ``There was no way to tell when they'd be back,'' said Suzanne
Thornton, one of the military wives who attended a briefing at Fort
Bragg, N.C., home of the Army's 82nd Airborne paratroops.
   A serviceman airlifted out of that Central American country
worried about the family he left behind, and military retirees
cheered the invasion.
   ``If they want help, I'll join them,'' retired Marine William
Little said in Jacksonville, N.C., home of the Marines' Camp
Lejeune.
   Marine Cpl. Garreth C. Isaak, one of 15 servicemen killed in the
operation, had left on a three-month tour of duty in Panama in late
October, his father, Al Isaak, said in a telephone interview from
Greenville, S.C.
   Isaak, a Greenville native based at Camp Lejeune, had been
scheduled to return home in January, and would have turned 23 on
Dec. 28.
   Al Isaak said he spoke to his son about a week ago by telephone.
Two days ago, the family received a letter dated Dec. 10.
   ``He said he was anxious to get on with the job they were there
to do,'' said Bob Jones IV, a friend who read the letter. Jones
said Isaak was referring to U.S. military intervention in Panama.
   At Fort Bragg, military police ordered reporters out of the
area, and the base was closed to the news media until further
notice.
   Barbara Rogers said officials confirmed her husband, Sgt. Buck
Rogers, was involved in the operation, which was no surprise to
her. She said officials gave the wives something of a pep talk.
   ``They told us it's like they were training for a big football
game and this is the football game,'' she said. ``I know that
sounds crazy, but it's true.''
   Mrs. Thornton said it was comforting to hear any news. ``We were
worried, wanting to know something,'' she said. ``This put me at
ease as much as they could.''
   At the USO servicemen's lounge at Charleston International
Airport in South Carolina, an Air Force representative announced
that military charter flights scheduled for early Wednesday,
Thursday and Friday had been canceled, said lounge director Peter
Wells.
   ``We've got a huge amount of people (in the lounge) trying to
get out,'' many waiting for a flight to Panama, Wells said.
   Among those at the lounge was Army Spec. 4 Harry Gilliam of
Alexandria, La. Gilliam said he was worried because he hadn't heard
from his wife, Mirna, who's been in Panama since Saturday.
   He said he, his wife and two stepsons had been in Panama on
leave when he went to an Army post to look for a place to stay. The
Army ordered him to return to the United States, and hustled him
onto a plane before he could tell his family.
   His Panamanian wife and children were staying with his wife's
relatives in Panama City, but he hasn't heard from them since being
flown out.
   ``She needs to check in at a military base, where she needs to
check with the Red Cross,'' Gilliam said, almost in tears. ``I've
checked with the Red Cross here myself, and they said it might
difficult to get in touch with her.''
   He said he planned to stay in Charleston until he hears
something about his family.

going in to assist a democratically elected government against a
dictator.''
   There have been many reports from Eastern Europe crediting
Gorbachev's refusal to support local Communist parties for the
dramatic emergence of non-Communist governments in several capitals.
   Noriega overturned the results of an election this year in which
Panama citizens voted for Guillermo Endara for president on May 7.
Noriega-formed ``Dignity Battalions'' beat opposition candidates in
the streets.

   Some Americans called it necessary, a professor in California
said it was an overreaction and a Panamanian dissident in
Pennsylvania said U.S. military intervention in his homeland
Wednesday was a ``profound error.''
   In New York City, about 200 people marched through midtown to
protest the invasion, chanting ``U.S. out of Panama!'' and other
slogans. They were jeered by numerous passersby.
   ``Get out of here!'' banker Jay Smith shouted at the protesters.
``You're wrong!''
   About 200 protesters marched in downtown Seattle, and about 100
gathered in freezing temperatures in Boston.
   ``Panama is a sister Caribbean country that has outrageous
conditions of poverty. Military solutions bring nothing,'' Dessima
Williams, a former ambassador to the Organization of American
States from Grenada and a fellowship student at Radcliffe College,
said at the Boston rally.
   ``You need a revolution here in the U.S.,'' she said to cheers
from the crowd.``You need a revolution in foreign policy.''
   While Americans and others had mixed opinions about President
Bush's decision to use U.S. troops in Panama, they expressed little
support for Panama leader Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``If I had a Christmas wish it'd be that dictators like that all
die,'' said Karen Romano, a 26-year-old sales assistant in Chicago.
   ``What we're doing here is getting rid of a hooligan that is
causing great turmoil in our hemisphere,'' said Jose Garcia De
Lara, national president of San Antonio-based League of United
Latin American Citizens, which claims 125,00 members nationwide.
   ``I think it's a good move. Manuel Noriega is an international
criminal and should be brought to justice,'' said Bernie Morgan,
62, civil court manager in Rochester, N.Y.
   ``I don't always agree with an eye for an eye, but how much can
you take?'' said Daniel Epps, 35, of Randallstown, Md., referring
to the death of a U.S. Marine lieutenant in Panama on Saturday.
   ``It's not a war on Panama. It's a war on drugs,'' Robert Mauro,
a street vendor in New York City, said in reference to drug charges
against Noriega in the United States. ``The drugs are undermining
our country.''
   Criticism centered on the invasion early Wednesday by American
troops in search of Noriega.
   ``This was a profound error. As a Panamanian and an professor of
international law, I can't agree with the action the U.S. has
taken,'' said Miguel Antonio Bernal, a Fulbright professor at
Lehigh University in Pennsylvania and editor of the Panamanian
opposition newspaper, Alternativa.
   ``The U.S. intervenes with thousands of people just to arrest
one guy. This isn't going to help in the long term of our
relationship,'' he said.
   Terry Karl, an assistant professor of political science at
Stanford University in California and Latin American specialist,
said he thought the attack was an overreaction.
   ``It is particularly unfortunate of the United States to rely on
force to resolve issues at a time when the Soviet Union has
renounced the use of force against countries on its borders,'' Karl
said.
   Thomas W. Walker, director of Ohio University's Latin America
studies program, said Latin America should solve its own problems.
   ``We, just like the Soviets, have to learn to be more relaxed in
dealing with the countries that are essentially under our wing,''
Walker said in a statement.
   The executive secretary of the Quakers' American Friends Service
Committee in Philadelphia condemned the military action.
   ``Shorn of rhetoric, this is another case of the U.S. imposing
its will on another country through direct military intervention, a
clear violation of international law,'' said Asia A. Bennett.
   Brian Becker, who helped organize the New York protest, said the
invasion violated the Constitution. ``Only Congress can declare
war,'' Becker said.
   Another protester, Sharon Ayling, said the invasion was an
attempt to regain control of the Panama Canal. The United States
has agreed to turn the canal over to Panama by the year 2000.
   Condemnation also came from the family of Sarah York, a
12-year-old Michigan girl who struck up a correspondence with
Noriega following his 1988 indictment on U.S. drug charges and
twice has visited the dictator.
   The telephone at the family's home in the Upper Peninsula
community of Negaunee was answered by a recorded message from
Sarah's mother, Pauline York: ``We join the people and the nations
of the world in calling on the president and his military to end
this invasion. To the Panamanian people: Todo por la patria,''
which means ``all for the motherland.''
   Others expressed reservations.
   ``Personally, I don't think it's a great idea. The U.S.S.R.
isn't that happy about it and things were going good with them
prior to this,'' said Kari Schumann, 23, a sales assistant from
Henrietta, N.Y.
   But support came from Bush's predecessor and former public
officials.
   ``President Bush's decision to use U.S. military personnel to
protect the lives of American citizens in Panama and to restore
democracy there was correct and deserves our full support,'' former
President Reagan said in a statement issued from his office in Los
Angeles.
   He said the administration has tried to reach a negotiated
settlement to the problems in Panama, but Noriega rejected all
diplomatic efforts.
   ``There comes a time when a president must take action. That
time has come. I join all Americans in the hope that the people of
Panama will soon know the freedoms to which they are entitled, and
that those who have so abused their power there will be brought to
justice,'' Reagan said.
   Former Sen. Howard Baker, who was Senate minority leader when
the Panama Canal treaty was ratified in 1977, said the assault was
the ``only logical response to the situation.''
   Ambler Moss Jr., former U.S. Ambassador to Panama who negotiated
the Panama Canal Treaty, said public criticism from democratically
elected Latin America leaders is likely.
   ``What Latin American leaders will say publicly and what they
think privately are two different things. But they frankly are very
happy to see Noriega fall,'' Moss said in Coral Gables, Fla.
   ``We should have done it a long time ago,'' said Arnold Hunter,
a Greenville, Tenn., retiree who served in World War II and the
Korean War. ``I'm sorry I'm too old to go ... I don't feel lives
are lost when it's for a good cause.''
   Robert Wesson, Hoover Institution scholar and author of a series
of books on Latin America, said the intervention could be a big
plus for Bush's popularity in the United States.
   `As long as the government is acting on behalf of democratic
institutions, getting rid of a pretty terrible dictator, putting in
power people who were elected, and not putting claims on the
country or the canal, I don't think there will be serious
criticism,'' he said from Hoover, a think tank on the Stanford
campus.

   The U.S. attack force captured or drove most
regular Panamanian Defense Forces from their bases on Wednesday and
planned to begin clearing the streets of Panama City on Thursday of
troops loyal to their fugitive leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,
top Pentagon officials said.
   ``It looks like the organized resistance is a thing of the
past,'' said Lt. Gen. Tom Kelly, the director of operations for the
Pentagon's Joint Staff.
   U.S. troops reported seeing Noriega several times on Tuesday,
but on Wednesday he and an undetermined number of loyal troops
eluded capture, Kelly told a Pentagon briefing.
   Fifteen American servicemen were killed, more than 100 were
wounded and one was missing, Pentagon officials said. An American
female dependent also died in the fighting.
   The U.S. forces captured 250 members of Noriega's army. Sporadic
fighting was reported late in the day, but most Panamanian units
had dispersed and may have fled into the jungle, Kelly said.
   ``We have a concern that they have gone off into the jungle,''
he told reporters. ``There is every chance that we will go off
after them.''
   The main operation on Thursday will be moving military police
and other units into Panama City, a city of 1 million where nine of
Noriega's 18 so-called Dignity Battalions were spotted Wednesday,
said Rear Adm. Ted Shaefer, an intelligence specialist.
   The Dignity Battalions, which beat civilian candidates during
elections last spring, are poorly armed and organized and are not
considered a major military threat, said Shaefer.
   U.S. officials expect ship traffic to resume Thursday through
the Panama Canal, said Kelly.
   ``The canal is functioning. There has been no endeavor that we
have discovered to destroy it,'' he said.
   The more than 20,000 American troops sent against Panamanian
military bases Wednesday moved in relative secrecy and carried out
simultaneous, pre-dawn attacks using paratroopers, infantry and
light tank units, top Pentagon officials say.
   ``It is among the most professionally executed operations that I
have seen in 33 years of military status,'' Kelly told a Pentagon
briefing. But he said without elaborating that ``we have
information that human beings in Panama have made mistakes.''
   The identities of the dead and wounded had not been released by
late afternoon; casualties were being flown to Kelley Air Force
Base in San Antonio, Texas.
   The U.S. forces failed initially to capture their prime target,
Noriega. Hours after the 1 a.m. invasion, American troops continued
to encounter sniper fire and pockets of resistance, said Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Nevertheless, Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, proclaimed ``Operation Just Cause'' a success.
   ``This reign of terror is over,'' he proclaimed.
   Powell, in a breakfast-hour briefing, said Noriega was ``not
running anything, because we own all of the bases he owned eight
hours ago.''
   The U.S. operations, involving Ranger paratroopers, Marine Corps
and Army infantrymen and light tanks, were launched simultaneously
against Panamanian military bases and Noriega's heaquarters, the
Commandencia.
   ``I hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was,
and how competently it was carried out,'' Powell said.
   In addition to the 13,000 U.S. troops stationed in Panama, the
United States sent 7,000 troops there overnight and was airlifting
an additional 2,500 over the course of the day, for a total of
22,500, said Powell.
   U.S. forces stationed in Panama before the invasion included the
193rd Infantry Brigade, reinforced with Marine Corps units; a
battalion from the 7th Infantry division at Fort Ord, Calif.; a
mechanized battalion from the 5th Infantry Division at Fort Polk,
La., and Military Police units, Powell said.
   The decision to invade was made Sunday night. The next night,
the of additional forces from the United States began, including a
brigade from the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort Bragg, N.C., two
Ranger battalions, and selected Special Operations units. Units
headed for Panama Tuesday included the 16th Military Police brigade
from Fort Bragg.
   Powell said the units were concentrated into four main groups.
They are:
   _Task Force Atlantic, made up of the 82nd Airborne and 7th
Infantry divisions, which occupied the Electrical Distribution
Center, the Madden Dam and the Gamboa Prison, where they liberated
47 Panamanian officers taken prisoner after the abortive Oct. 3
coup attempt against Noriega.
   _Task Force Semper Fidelis, made up of Marines and a light
armored infantry company, which attacked the area around the Bridge
of the Americas and the U.S. Howard Air Force Base, and ``completed
their missions successfully,'' he said.
   _Task Force Red, which attacked two Panamanian Defense Forces
units that had been loyal to Noriega in the Oct. 3 coup, the 6th
and 7th Infantry Companies. Some Noriega loyalists were captured
but others escapted, he said.
   _Task Force Bayonet, made up of the 6th Mechanized battalion,
light tanks, and the 5th battalion of the 87th Infantry, which
attacked Noriega's headquarters, the scene of the heaviest fighting.
   Asked whether Noriega might form a guerrilla army, Powell said:
   ``He can do that, and we will chase him and we will find him. He
is a very canny individual. He's demonstrated incredible ability to
survive catastrophe, and we'll see over time whether he survives
this catastrophe.
   ``It's been some years since General _ Mister _ Noriega, the
fugitive, has been seen in the jungle. He's used to a different
kind of lifestyle. I'm not quite sure he would be up to being
chased around the countryside by Army Rangers, Special Forces and
light infantry units.''

   U.S. allies in Latin America condemned the use
of force by the United States in speeches Wednesday before the
Organization of American States but bogged down in haggling over
procedures to vote on a resolution.
   Many of the members spoke out against the U.S. attacks in Panama
but they held fast to a rule requiring resolutions be submitted 24
hours before a vote can take place. They agreed to meet again
Thursday.
   The resolution was suggested by Panamanian ambassador Jose Maria
Cabrera, a supporter of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noreiga, and was
introduced by Nicaragua. Cabrera called on the OAS to condemn the
``brutal and criminal aggression'' against his country by the
United States.
   The United States asked members to ``rally around'' the decision
to send American troops into Panama.
   ``We hope you will understand and support our action,'' said
U.S. representative Luigi Einaudi.
   In a separate action, the Mexican government condemned the U.S.
invasion, although it also denounced Noriega.
   ``The fight against international crime is not sufficient reason
to intervene in a sovereign nation,'' the Mexican government said
in a statement issued through its embassy in Washington. ``In
Mexico's opinion, dialogue and negotiation continue to offer the
best alternative in finding a peaceful solution to the situation.''
   Among the usual allies condemning the use of force at the OAS
meeting were Brazil, Chile, Peru, Haiti, Uruguay and Costa Rica.
   Before the meeting began, the members met behind closed doors to
discuss a letter sent by Panama's newly sworn-in president,
Guillermo Endara, asking that the OAS recognize Lawrence Chewning
Fabrega as his designated representative. The letter was telefaxed
from the U.S. Southern Command.
   The OAS members decided to recognize Cabrera. They did not
consider the issue of whether they recognized Endara and his
government.
   ``The forces of the United States continue bombing,'' Cabrera
told the OAS ministers at an emergency session called by Panama to
denounce the U.S. invasion in his country.
   ``Under no circumstances will we accept some supposed leaders
who are puppets imposed by the United States,'' he said, referring
to Endara's government, which is recognized by the Bush
administration.
   The resolution before the OAS asked members to condemn the use
of force and demand a withdrawal of the troops.
   One of the ambassadors, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said shortly before the meeting began that the OAS ``has to condemn
this act, no matter how bad Noriega is. We can't condone violence.''
   President Bush said Wednesday that he ordered troops into Panama
to save American lives and bring Noriega to the United States to be
tried on drug trafficking charges.
   Bush said the United States would withdraw its invasion force as
soon as possible.
   ``The United States is very pleased that the outlaw regime
manipulated by Manuel Antonio Noriega has given way to a regime
that reflects the democratic will of the people,'' Einaudi told OAS
members. ``Noriega increasingly acted in an unstable, unpredictable
and dangerous manner.''
   The Nicaraguan representative, Victoria Castillo, sided with
Panama.
   ``It is an aberration to speak of democracy and carry out
aggression,'' she said.

   Two transport planes flew 108 servicemen
wounded in the U.S. invasion of Panama to military hospitals
Wednesday, but three were dead on arrival and another died later,
officials said.
   The first C-141 landed at Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio at
11:37 a.m. with 43 soldiers aboard, including the three dead and
the one who died shortly after arrival.
   The 39 wounded were taken to Wilford Hall Medical Center at
adjacent Lackland Air Force Base, said Lt. Dave Ebner, a spokesman
at Kelly. Some were well enough to take buses, and others were
taken by ambulance, said Lackland spokeswoman Dolores Schroeder.
   The second C-141 arrived at Kelly around 5:30 p.m. with 65
soldiers with ``serious to very critical'' injuries, said Lt. Col.
Johnny Whitaker, another Lackland spokesman.
   ``The biggest and the most extensive injuries are gunshot-type
wounds, schrapnel-type wounds, leg wounds, broken bones, this sort
of thing,'' Whitaker said.
   Forty-one of the soldiers on the second flight were taken across
town to Brooke Army Medical Center, Whitaker said. The rest went to
Wilford Hall.
   Another transport was expected later Wednesday, said Whitaker,
who was unsure how many wounded would be aboard.
   Kelly officials were told their base would be the sole reception
point for wounded from Panama.
   Pentagon officials said 15 U.S. servicemen and a female civilian
dependent were killed, one serviceman was missing and more than 100
were wounded.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III says he
regrets possibly misleading the American public about a secret trip
to China taken by two high-level Bush administration officials.
   Baker said through a spokeswoman Tuesday night ``he felt
obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission the president wished
to have classified.''
   Speaking for Baker, spokeswoman Margaret D. Tutwiler added: ``He
regrets that he may have misled some...''
   It was the first acknowledgement of error since the White House
announced on Dec. 9 that national security adviser Brent Scowcroft
and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger were visiting
Beijing. Their trip was roundly condemned in Congress as a friendly
gesture to China and a cancellation of the ban President Bush
imposed on high-level exchanges after pro-democracy students were
massacred in early June in Tiananmen Square.

   Requests for help from the homeless and hungry
increased during the past year _ particularly among families with
children _ and many cities were unable to meet the need, according
to a survey released today.
   Many cities were forced to turn away families and others needing
shelter and food, the U.S. Conference of Mayors said.
   Increases in hunger, homelessness and poverty are ``one of the
most dramatic changes that swept across our country'' in the 1980s,
said Boston Mayor Ray Flynn, chairman of the conference's task
force on hunger and homelessness.
   Requests for emergency shelter in 1989 increased by 25 percent
in the cities surveyed, said the mayors' annual report on hunger
and homelessness in urban America. Requests for emergency food
increased by 19 percent.

   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King is
supporting a plan under which the government early next year would
mail monthly refunds to millions of elderly people overcharged for
Medicare premiums.
   If the plan goes through, Social Security beneficiaries who
unavoidably will be overcharged by about $5.30 a month for their
Medicare coverage early in 1990 will be simultaneously issued
monthly refund checks.
   The overcharges are the result of Congress' late action in
repealing Medicare's catastrophic health-care program. Social
Security contends its computers can't be adjusted by January to
halt withholding of the extra Medicare premium for catastrophic
coverage.
   As a result, nearly 27 million Social Security beneficiaries who
have Medicare premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks
are expected to be overcharged from January through May.

<HEAD>Quayle Making the Most of Favorable Publicity</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year into his vice presidency, Dan Quayle is
making the most of any favorable publicity that comes his way, his
wry smile an acknowledgement that it has been scarce. There is no
comparable shortage of advice _ he gets that all the time.
   He's been told to raise his profile, and to lower it; to be more
relaxed, and to be more guarded against gaffes. He has been advised
to specialize on a few, chosen trademark issues, and to be a
generalist so as to display a grasp on the whole catalogue of
issues. Through it all, Quayle has one set answer: he works for
President Bush and he will keep doing what the boss wants done.
   His assignment in 1990 will include a heavy political campaign
schedule, a traditional vice presidential role in off-year
elections. For Quayle that job could be a way to overcome old image
problems and prove that he's not out of his depth, perceptions that
haunt him in the public opinion surveys.
   Vice presidents tend to be underemployed; as Nelson A.
Rockefeller said in shunning the post he later filled, they are
standby equipment. They usually get specialized assignments _
Quayle's include space issues and efforts to enhance U.S.
competitiveness in world markets. But other officials have primary,
day-to-day responsibility. It's always difficult for the No. 2 man
to put his own imprint on government actions or decisions. As
Ronald Reagan's vice president, Bush headed a task force on
regulatory reform, a popular topic in the deregulation decade. It
looked like a promising role, but not much happened.
   That's not uncommon for understudies.
   A vice president is a dependent. His official standing depends
entirely on the boss. Bush has helped on that score.
   Quayle sees Bush every morning when both are in town, and says
he has full access to the president. ``This has been a very
comfortable, important relationship that we have worked out in
these early morning sessions,'' Quayle said this week in a C-Span
television interview.
   That well-advertised access provides a sort of power.
   ``When I'm on Capitol Hill ... senators, congressmen say `would
you please give this to the president?' or `tell the president
this,' or `I don't like this particular policy, I want you to do
something about it,''' Quayle said in the TV interview.
   Bush has publicly promised Quayle renomination for a second term
as vice president and top Republicans consider the commitment to be
absolute.
   But neither job security nor presidential praise has done much
for the performance ratings, despite what Quayle considers a good
first year in office. So he relished a Dec. 15 Wall Street Journal
column praising his performance.
   ``After 12 months in this job I will take any favorable
publicity I can possibly obtain, and I will pocket it,'' he said.
``And I think I'll take that editorial and make sure that it's
reprinted and perhaps sent out to some of my friends.''
   Republican Party leaders say that Quayle can raise both his
profile and his standing in 1990 in the off-year campaign role that
has become traditional for vice presidents. He already gets good
ratings for his work for party candidates and causes. The party
counts about $7 million in proceeds from GOP fundraising events
featuring Quayle.
   Bush will be out campaigning for chosen Republican candidates
next year, as he has at fundraising events for two GOP Senate
challengers. But the heavy schedule of sustained campaigning is
assigned to the vice president. It was Bush's role in the two
off-year elections of his vice presidency, and it will be Quayle's
in 1990.
   He'll have help. In January, E. Spencer Abraham, the Michigan
Republican chairman, will become his deputy chief of staff,
concentrating on political liaison and supervising speech writing,
travel planning and the like.
   The vice president says he'd like to spend more time outside the
Washington beltway, in ``the real America.'' He'll have ample
opportunity in the coming campaign, in a role that can help him
shape a new image or cement the old one.
   Quayle said his sometimes shaky performance in the 1988 campaign
was due in part to traveling consultants who over-coached him to
the point of stifling him. In 1990 he can do it his way.

   When producer Woody Fraser created ABC's
``Home'' show two years ago to help people live their lives he
didn't know it was going to get so personal.
   ``What the show is really about is to give people ideas and help
them make decisions,'' said Fraser.
   The morning show offers practical suggestions on health,
cooking, home buying and remodeling, automobiles and arts. It has a
number of regular experts, including one who reviews movies and
videos from the standpoint of families with small children.
``Home'' marks its 500th show on Thursday and celebrates its second
anniversary on Jan. 18.
   But for Fraser, who established ABC's ``Good Morning America,''
``The Mike Douglas Show,'' ``That's Incredible'' and many other
shows, it got very personal seven months ago.
   Fraser, 55, suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass
surgery. Since then, he's lost 47 pounds by changing his eating
habits and exercising.
   ``I cut out fats and dairy products from my diet and took up
exercise,'' he said. ``I went from being a sedentary individual to
a person who's active again. I get more sleep. I do yoga. I found
that doctors don't know anything about diet. I read all the books
that people sent me when I had my heart attack. I picked out the
things that worked for me.''
   He put his personal experiences on the air and made a rare
appearance as a guest. Last July, after he returned to work, he
devoted a week to a series called ``Heart and Soul.'' The show was
devoted to a study that showed yoga, meditation and positive
affirmation are helpful in preventing and recovering from heart
attacks.
   ``Home'' also undergoes a change next Tuesday. Gary Collins
takes over as host, replacing Robb Weller. Collins has been host of
the Miss America Pageant for the past five years and was the
Emmy-winning host of ``Hour Magazine.''
   Fraser said he's wanted to do ``Home'' ever since he founded
``Good Morning America'' in 1975.
   ``I wanted a show that would go later in the morning,'' he said.
``Its purpose is to give women information that they can apply to
their lives. The key word here is information. I said to ABC, `Give
me 60 minutes and I'll give you 30 ideas you've never heard of.'
It's a hard show to promote because we offer help for the home.
   ``Recently in the TV listings `Oprah' had a show about women who
had shot their husbands and still loved them. `Geraldo' had satanic
babies. `Donahue' had cross-dressing. And we had a show about
barbecuing.
   ``We don't have a great come on. But the people who watch our
show come back. That's why Gary Collins is taking over. I want to
add his marquee value to the show. I think he'll bring us viewers.''
   Of all network shows on daytime television, ``Home'' has the
largest audience among women 18-34, Fraser said. ``Home'' also puts
out a newsletter that goes to two million subscribers.
   A show on poisons in the home got 44,000 responses to a 900
number. For $2 viewers got a newsletter, information on poisons and
$6 in coupons. The sponsor had expected only about 5,000 responses.
   Since it began, the show has expanded to an hour from 30 minutes
and has gone to live telecast instead of tape. The live telecast
allows the show to have satellite remotes and to take instant polls.
   ``Home'' has also taken its name to heart and has purchased
three houses and is about to purchase a fourth.
   ``We take the viewer through every step of the purchase and
financing,'' said Fraser. ``Then we go in and remodel and
redecorate the house. We started with a house that cost about
$160,000. Then we sold it and bought a house for $240,000. Each
time we apply the profit to buying a more expensive house. The last
house we bought for $300,000 but we haven't been able to sell it
because of the poor real estate market.
   ``The last house is a duplex. People had asked us to do
something on apartments. Each side of the house is like an
apartment, so we were able to show people things to do with smaller
space.''

   Others have dared, but there's really only one
Peter Pan, and her name is Mary Martin.
   Along with her role as nurse Nellie Forbush in ``South
Pacific,'' Peter Pan is the 76-year-old entertainer's favorite
part. It's in his self-description that she'd like to be
remembered: ``I'm youth. I'm joy. I'm freedom.''
   Right now, though, she's happy to be recognized by the Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in its annual ``The Kennedy Center
Honors.'' A taped show of the early December festivities in
Washington will be broadcast by CBS on Dec. 29. Other honorees are
actress Claudette Colbert, entertainer Harry Belafonte, composer
William Schuman and ballerina Alexandra Danilova.
   Miss Martin found out she was to be honored from her old friend,
Miss Colbert. ``I was on Martha's Vineyard last summer and she
called from Barbados and said, `Did you hear we're going to be
together?'''
   Although Miss Martin counts her three years of making movies as
the low part of her life, she did make some close friends in the
business, including Miss Colbert.
   ``She came to stay with me in England when I was doing `South
Pacific' over there. She had just lost her husband,'' Miss Martin
recalled in an interview in the New York apartment of her son,
actor Larry Hagman.
   ``In the Paramount (studio) days, they made me up to look like
her. In those days whoever was very famous, they made you look like
her. One night we were at a party at Jack and Mary Benny's house. I
was sitting with Claudette's husband, a very famous doctor. We were
talking at great length. He said he must go see a man. He came back
and said, `I think we have to go home now.'
   ``I said: `I'd like to go home with you, but you can't go home
with me. I'm not Claudette.'
   ``They made me look so much like her, he thought it was. I have
pictures. You can't tell us apart.''
   Miss Martin went to Paramount Pictures after her star-making
debut on Broadway in 1938, singing ``My Heart Belongs to Daddy'' in
``Leave It to Me.''
   ``I didn't like making movies at all,'' she said. She and the
president of Paramount ``out-Southerned each other,'' talking tough
in honeyed accents over her declared intention of leaving _ she
saying she'd go back to Weatherford, Texas, and reopen her dance
studio, he saying she couldn't break her contract.
   The compromise was a leave of absence to star on Broadway in
``One Touch of Venus'' in 1943. She went on to portray Maria in
``The Sound of Music'' and to star in ``Peter Pan'' and ``South
Pacific.''
   Her last show, ``Legends!,'' in which she toured with Carol
Channing in 1986, didn't make it to Broadway.
   ``It's one show I didn't like,'' she said. ``I did the show
because Larry said to me, `Mother, you've been off long enough.'
Now I think my children are going to decide to let me do what I
want to. I think it's very sweet of them. I have many ideas. I
might do something after New Year's. I'm superstitious; I won't say
what.''
   Miss Martin last flew in Peter Pan's aerial rig when she was 70,
at a benefit in San Francisco. ``I could do it this minute,'' she
said.
   Learning to fly came naturally _ and very young.
   ``I put my arms up and took off from our garage. I heard mother
screaming from the kitchen, `What have you done now?' She saw me
take off. I knew I could fly. There was a little problem there. I
hit the ground first. Peter Pan hadn't come along. I broke my
collarbone.''
   Miss Martin was 13 years younger than her sister. Her mother had
wanted a boy but got a tomboy who broke many bones. And young Mary
married at 16 to get away from school, had a son at 17 and went
into show business, her mother was more than happy to raise her
grandson.
   ``She worshiped him; I couldn't take him away from her,'' Miss
Martin said. Hagman, 13-year star of ``Dallas,'' grew up saying he
wanted nothing to do with sow business, because it took his mother
away from him. ``He felt neglected,'' she admits. But he overcame
negative feelings about both show business and his mother.
   Miss Martin was divorced from Ben Hageman, a Weatherford lawyer,
shortly after their son was born (Larry later dropped the `e' in
his last name). In 1940, she married agent Richard Halliday. They
had a daughter, Heller.
   ``Richard was fabulous. We had a wonderful marriage.'' He died
in 1973, a few years after they retired to a ranch in Brazil.
Heller was getting married, so Miss Martin spent a year in London,
then sold the ranch and bought homes on Martha's Vineyard and in
the California desert. She has six grandchildren and one
great-grandchild. All attended the Kennedy Center ceremony.
   Miss Martin has had two abdominal operations for cancer and says
she's now all right. ``Let's hope it stays like that.
   ``In my life I don't dwell on anything. If it's going to happen
it'll happen. I believe a great deal in a higher being. Every time
I can't figure anything out, I think about it and ask, `What else
can I do?' It is always turning out.
   ``I've had an absolutely wonderful life, with my family and my
children and my friends and the theater, which I love more than
anything,'' she said.
   ``I have no fear of leaving the world. I think you have a
happier life if you can feel that way. You go on to the next step.
When it's time to go, you go.
   ``I said to the man who owns Madison Square Garden, who lives in
the same place I do, Rancho Mirage, Calif., `Do you have a window
in the back of Madison Square Garden?' He asked why. `I'd like to
use it sometime.' He asked for what. `I'm going to fly out the
window and not come back.' Every time he sees me he asks, `When do
we start on that window?' I say, `I'll let you know.'
   ``I'm not kidding much. What a way to go, if you could.''
   Just like Peter Pan.

   The government reported a 0.4 percent rise in
consumer inflation last month despite a drop in gasoline costs.
   November's seasonally adjusted increase in the Consumer Price
Index, which translated into an annual inflation rate of 4.9
percent, followed a brisk 0.5 percent rise in October and
relatively modest hikes from June through September, the Labor

   Housing starts dropped 4.7 percent in
November, pulled down by a big dip in multifamily construction, the
government said.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new houses and
apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.36
million units in November, down from 1.43 million units in October.
   Total housing starts for the first 11 month of the year were
down 6.5 percent from the same period of 1988. Applications for
building permits, a barometer of future housing activity, edged
down 1.7 percent in November after rising 2.8 percent in October.

   The nation's dominant long-distance telephone
company, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., announced it will cut
basic, daytime interstate rates an average of 1.3 percent Jan. 1.
Evening rates will drop an average of 2.0 percent.
   AT&amp;T said Tuesday the lowered rates reflect reduced expenses,
mainly from reduced fees that AT&amp;T will pay in 1990 to local
telephone companies for access to local exchanges.
   AT&amp;T said the reductions were necessary under changes earlier
this year in the Federal Communications Commission's regulation of
long-distance charges. The FCC now imposes caps on AT&amp;T's
long-distance rates based on the company's long-distance expenses,
as opposed to a preset rate of return.

   Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. has agreed to pay a
$100,000 civil penalty to settle a dispute with the government over
insulation ads, the Federal Trade Commission said.
   The FTC said Tuesday that Sears or its representatives failed to

   The ads ran within the last five years.
   Chicago-based Sears has agreed to create an advertisement
designed to educate consumers about home insulation, especially the
importance of having heat-resistance information when making a
purchase, the FTC said.
   The settlement must be approved by a federal judge in
Washington. The FTC said the consent decree does not constitute
admission of a law violation. The penalty is paid to the

   International Business Machines Corp.
has announced a partnership with a small software company that will
allow IBM's OfficeVision software to connect with office software
systems of other manufacturers.
   Under the agreement, Soft-Switch, of Wayne, Pa., has designed
software that will allow companies using OfficeVision to exchange
computer documents and electronic mail with office systems made by
Digital Equipment Corp., Wang Laboratories Inc., Hewlett-Packard
Co. and others, IBM said Tuesday.
   OfficeVision, introduced by IBM in May, allows companies using
various IBM computers of different sizes to tie them together in
one system. The software overcomes the incompatibility of many IBM
products, a shortfall that has been exploited by Digital and other
companies that make only compatible machines.
   The Soft-Switch products will be sold by both IBM and
Soft-Switch. They will be available Dec. 29 and will be priced from
$40,000 to $250,000, IBM said.
   Separately Tuesday, IBM introduced the most powerful member of
its Personal System-2 computer family, a model based on Intel
Corp.'s i486 microprocessor. The model, called the PS-2 Model 70
486, is priced at $12,395 and up.
   In addition, IBM said it would resume shipping a kit to upgrade
its earlier PS-2 Model 70 computers by adding the i486 chip. IBM
stopped shipping the kits in October after Intel alerted it to a
flaw in the chips. The trouble was corrected with a new version of
the microprocessor.

   Federal engineers have upgraded an
investigation of a possible steering deficiency in the 1988
Chevrolet Beretta, the government said.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also said
Tuesday it was investigating reports of exploding heating systems
in Coachmen Industries recreational vehicles and of cruise control
failures in the Ford Taurus and its twin, the Mercury Sable.
   The agency said it was stepping up its Beretta probe from a
preliminary evaluation, which involves mostly paperwork, to an
engineering analysis, in which the possibly defective parts are
examined.
   Such investigations can lead to recalls or can be dismissed if
engineers decide there is no widespread safety problem.
   There have been 39 complaints of loss of steering control in the
1988 Beretta, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said. Twenty-one accidents
and 10 injuries have been blamed on the problem. An estimated
259,000 of the vehicles are on the road.
   The Chevrolet Corsica is similar to the Beretta, but the agency
did not mention any steering problems with the Corsica.
   General Motors Corp. spokesman Tom Pyden said the company would
continue cooperating with the agency in its investigation.
   ``An engineering analysis doesn't necessarily mean there's a
defect with the vehicle,'' Pyden said.
   The agency has begun a preliminary evaluation of Coachmen
Industries recreational vehicles manufactured between 1981 and
1985. There have been four reports of explosions in the vehicles'
furnaces, which burn liquified petroleum gas, Hurd said. No
injuries or accidents have been reported.
   An estimated 40,000 of the vehicles were manufactured in the
five-year period, he said.
   A spokeswoman for Coachmen Industries, based in Elkhart, Ind.,
said she was not familiar with the report and could not comment.
   The agency also launched a preliminary evaluation of the Ford
Taurus and Mercury Sable manufactured between 1986 and 1988. There
have been 15 reports of cruise controls failing to disengage, Hurd
said. No accidents or injuries have been reported.
   The investigation covers an estimated 1.25 million vehicles,
Ford spokeswoman Joy Stinson said.
   A preliminary evalution was begun of reported fuel tank
corrosion in large General Motors pickup trucks manufactured
between 1984 and 1988. There have been four complaints. An
estimated 1.7 million vehicles are on the road.
   The agency also discontinued several investigations, finding no
evidence of a widespread problem. Among them:
   _Microprocessor problems with the 1987-88 Plymouth Sundance and
its twin, the Dodge Shadow.
   _Fires under the dash in the 1988 and 1989 Ford Mustang and its
twin, the Mercury Capri.
   _Passive restraint system problems in the 1987 Hyundai Excel.
   _Safety belt failure in all Mazda models manufactured between
1984 and 1989.

<HEAD>Some Grand Marnier Mechanical Ads Fail To Operate</HEAD>

   Importers of Grand Marnier liqueur say the
failure of about 10 percent of the 200,000 motorized holiday
advertisements they placed in The New Yorker magazine earlier this
month doesn't discourage them.
   Michel Roux, president of Carillon Importers Ltd. of Teaneck,
N.J., called the failure rate ``normal when introducing new
technology'' and said he remained committed to trying new
approaches to magazine ads.
   He estimated there have been about 500 complaints from readers
who were disappointed that the highly-touted ad didn't work as they
thought it should.
   The ad shows two birds with opposite ends of a ribbon in their
beaks. The ribbon is draped around a liqueur bottle and as the
birds alternately appear to fly higher, the bottle beneath them
swings as if it were a bell.
   Roux said Monday in a telephone interview that reader surveys
indicated 10 percent of the ads failed to operate as intended, and
that the company was distributing replacements to those who ask for
them.
   ``It's not a serious problem. We have mailed out 500 or so ads
to people who said their ad didn't work,'' he said.
   He said the technology which made use of a battery and wire
embedded beneath the pieces of cardboard used for the ad was
sensitive and some systems were likely to get crushed in the
binding and mailing processes.
   Some of the ads sent back were in working condition, but the
readers apparently didn't wait long enough for the motorized action
to begin, Roux said. He said a few people complained that the bell
didn't ring _ but the ad was not designed to emit any sound. And
other ads simply didn't work.
   From Roux's perspective, getting a complaint isn't the worst
thing that could happen. ``It shows they were interested by the
ad,'' he said.
   Carillon spent about $750,000 on producing and placing the ad in
200,000 issues of the Dec. 11 edition of The New Yorker that were
sent to subscribers in California and New York state.
   The company has tried to make use of advances in technology for
other magazine ads in the past, including singing and talking
microchips for another of its products, Absolut vodka.
   Steven Florio, president of The New Yorker, said the magazine
got ``about a dozen calls'' about Grand Marnier ads that failed to
move.
   But he said he welcomed the attention that Roux's ads bring to
the magazine. ``We hope he does something as innovative next
year,'' Florio said.

   The soft New England real estate market has made
Wall Street jumpy in recent days, but analysts say the slowdown has
been coming for a long time and isn't likely to disappear soon.
   The nervousness began Friday, when Bank of New England Corp.
announced it expected to report a ``substantial'' loss for the year
because it had to boost reserves to cover bad real estate loans.
   The bank, the nation's 15th largest, also said it might rescind
a stock dividend and would consider possible mergers and sales of
assets.
   The weekend seemed only to increase worries, and on Monday the
stock market took its sharpest drop in five weeks, with the Dow
Jones industrial average falling 42.02 points to 2697.53.
   Although the market stabilized Tuesday, brokers said investors
remained uneasy about the outlook for real estate, finance and
regional banks.
   ``It's probably too early to say `recession,''' said Mark Lynch,
a banking industry analyst with Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. ``But some of
the banks are going to be disasters. The fears in the market aren't
groundless.''
   The question on many minds was whether a regional real estate
slump could precipitate a full-scale nationwide recession, so far
averted after seven years of economic growth.
   ``Economic factors feed on each other, and it's hard to say
whether this leads to other declines,'' said Mas Kakutani, a
director of bank analysts for Moody's Investors Service Inc., a
credit-rating agency. ``But along with real estate we're seeing
slowdowns in manufacturing and the service industries.''
   One real estate group said Tuesday that talk of regional real
estate problems having national economic implications was overblown.
   ``Many of these `doom and gloom' analyses are authored on the
Eastern Seaboard, where median home prices in some cities have
declined over the past year,'' said Norman D. Flynn, president of
the National Association of Realtors. ``At any given time, some
housing markets are hot, some are not.''
   Analysts said the real estate problem began when zealous
regional banks courted too many deals during the construction boom
of the mid-1980s.
   ``There was too much money chasing too few good deals,'' said
George Fantini, senior vice president of the Boston Financial
Group, a real estate service company. ``There was a lot of money in
the hands of some inexperienced lending officers. People who had
made only $100,000 loans were suddenly making $5 million loans.''
   The big money fueled competition, and a herd mentality.
   ``Everyone got bullish on New England,'' Fantini said. ``It was
viewed as a wonderful market. Few people thought it would end.''
   The building continued, but buying stopped. The state's
high-tech industry, the juggernaut behind much of the
``Massachusetts Miracle,'' sputtered. Today, office buildings that
computer firms thought they could fill lie empty along Route 128
west of Boston.
   Kakutani of Moody's said real estate's dire straits could be
traced back at least 18 to 20 months, but banks are just starting
to take it seriously, he said.
   ``There's no question the banks were slow to respond,'' Kakutani
said. ``But banks often reflect the perceptions of the market.
Three months ago, most banks would have said this was part of a
periodic boom-and-bust cycle. They're not saying that anymore.''
   The only immediate solution for banks, Lynch said, is to keep
bad loans to a minimum, and to cut costs _ layoffs, in other words.
   Fantini admitted the situation was bad, but said federal
regulators were making it worse by forcing lending institutions to
liquidate their real estate assets too quickly.
   ``Regulators say to banks, `Sell your real estate assets.' I
say, `To who?''' Fantini said. ``There's no capital out there for
liquidation.''
   To dig themselves out of their financial quagmire, Fantini
suggested banks offer incentives like low-interest mortgages to
first-time home buyers.
   The only bright spot in New England's real estate market may be
cheaper homes for some buyers. Optimists hope declining interest
rates will support the real estate market via lower mortgage rates
for buyers and refinancings at lower costs for some existing
homeowners.
   ``This will provide opportunities to buy condominiums or
houses,'' Kakutani said. ``It will make home buying a more viable
option for some.''
   And the future? In all likelihood housing demand will continue
dropping, if population figures are any indication.
   Harvard University economist Gregory Mankiw, who has studied
population trends, said in the next decade there won't be many home
buyers to replace the baby-boomers, who drove housing prices up in
the 1970s and early '80s.
   ``We're coming into an unprecedented time in terms of low
population growth,'' Mankiw said. ``The 1990s will be a slow time
for housing.''

<HEAD>Three Convicted in $10 Million Du Pont Extortion Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Argentinian nationals have been
found guilty of trying to extort $10 million from the Du Pont Co.
for the return of stolen documents the company claimed contained
trade secrets for the production of Lycra.
   Lycra is Du Pont's trade name for spandex, an elastic fiber used
primarily in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards.
   A federal jury deliberated about two hours Tuesday before
returning guilty verdicts for conspiracy and attempted extortion
against Bruno Skerianz, Raul Armando Giordano and Antonio Ruben
Inigo.
   They each face up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
U.S. District judge Joseph Longobardi set sentencing for Feb. 26.
   Jose Petrosino, another defendant, is fighting extradition from
Italy. Charges were dropped against Maria I. Lorenzo de Bianchini,
who agreed to testify for the federal government.
   During the nine-day trial, the prosecution portrayed Skerianz as
the mastermind behind the extortion attempt.
   The defense, however, claimed Skerianz had not attempted
extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture
spandex for Radicci, an Italian textile manufacturer.
   The defense argued that Du Pont initiated the contact with
Skerianz after Mexican textile manufacturer Isaac Assa told the
Wilmington-based chemical giant that Skerianz had the documents.
Assa was a former employer of Skerianz.
   The prosecution argued Du Pont had been induced against its will
to agree to pay $10 million for 1,581 documents concerning Lycra
production that were stolen from its Lycra manufacturing plant in
Mercedes, Argentina.
   The prosecution said Du Pont was forced to enter into an
agreement with Skerianz and the others. Under the agreement,
Skerianz and the others would not work in spandex production for
five years. In addition, during that period, Du Pont would agree to
sell 20 tons of spandex yarn per month to a company chosen by
Skerianz.
   The negotiations had been conducted between Du Pont officials
and New York attorney Marvin Gersten, who represented Skerianz.
   Among the prosecution witnesses were Skerianz' two brothers,
both of whom work for Du Pont. One brother, Ferre Scheriase, a Du
Pont vice president for Latin American operations, testified that
during a conversation with Skerianz, his brother said, ```I am
willing to talk with anybody in Du Pont. If someone needs to know
the value of this (the documents), it is worth $10 million to me.'''
   Skerianz had worked for Du Pont more than 20 years ago, while
the others had resigned from the Mercedes plant in the fall of 1988.
   The three defendants and Lorenzo de Bianchini were all arrested
in February in Geneva, Switzerland, after an aborted attempt to
return the documents and pick up the $10 million.
   Petrosino was arrested later.
   Last year, Du Pont had Lycra sales of more than $600 million.
The company said it plans to invest more than $1 billion over the
next four years to expand its Lycra capacity. According to Du Pont,
the Lycra demand has exceeded the supply.
   Du Pont controls more than 50 percent of the spandex market
worldwide, according to company officials.

<HEAD>Mexican-U.S. Business Groups Proposing Common Market for North America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By F.N. D'ALESSIO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creation of a North American common market,
consisting of the United States, Canada and Mexico, is an idea
which appeals to a large majority of U.S. residents, according to a
new poll.
   The poll, released this week, was taken for a group of leading
Mexican business executives and an affiliated group in this country.
   The groups, the Mexican Council of Businessmen and the U.S.
Mexican Development Corporation, say such a common market is needed
to compete successfully with Japan and the European Economic
Community.
   ``Of the 1,200 individuals polled throughout the U.S., 85
percent favored a North American common market to offset
anticipated heavy competition when the EEC countries drop their
trade frontiers in 1992,'' said Jeffrey Peters, president of the
U.S. Mexican Development Corporation (USDC).
   Francisco del Cueto, a spokesman for the Mexican Council of
Businessmen (MCB), also said 1992 would be a critical year for
international trade.
   His organization, which includes owners, chairmen and executive
officers of Mexico's top 36 industrial groups, has long stressed
U.S.-Mexican cooperation.
   Nino Noriega, a USDC spokesman, said no formal proposals for the
creation of such a common market had been submitted to government
officials in the three nations involved.
   Noriega, however, said there had been some preliminary talks
with several U.S. congressmen.
   ``It's an evolutionary thing that appears to be inevitable,''
Noriega said of the elimination of North American trade barriers.
``It's a matter of common sense.
   ``You have: Mexico, with vast natural resources and a large pool
of less expensive labor; the U.S., with technological expertise and
a highly developed economy; and Canada, with a small population,
but a strong currency and credit power.''
   ``Trade barriers have essentially been erased between the U.S.
and Canada,'' Noriega said.
   ``And we have proof that the same thing would work between the
U.S. and Mexico through the `Maquiladora' program, whereby U.S.
manufacturers have goods finished in communities across the Mexican
border and reimported into this country.''
   Noriega said some people worry about cheap Mexican labor taking
jobs away from U.S. workers, but that that wouldn't be the case if
cooperation created jobs in Mexico.
   ``Consider,'' he said, ``the resources in Mexico and the
potential Mexican market for luxury goods the U.S. market is
already saturated with.
   ``People think of the Rio Grande as being like the Berlin Wall.
Most don't realize that if that wall came down, the heavy traffic _
businesswise _ would be southbound.''
   The telephone poll taken during November for the MCB and USDC
employed a sample similar to the U.S. national averages by gender,
age, ethnic background, educationl level and political philosophy,
Noriega said.
   Not surprisingly, the poll found that people of Hispanic
background, whether it be Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or from
another Spanish-speaking region, took a greater interest in Mexican
affairs than the general U.S. population.
   While only one third of the total respondents considered Mexico
a good place for American investment, more than 55 percent of the
Hispanic respondents considered it so.
   At the same time, though, 90 percent of the total respondents
said it was important for the U.S. to help Mexico to move ahead
economically.
   The poll, however, also revealed that many non-Hispanic
Americans have little knowledge of Mexico's political institutions
and recent history.
   ``Only about a third correctly identified Mexico as a democratic
country,'' said del Cueto. ``A greater number _ almost 40 percent,
in fact _ believe it to be socialistic, while more than 7 percent
even termed it a communist nation.''

   Stocks in London were sharply higher at midday

   At about noon in London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 20.8 points, or 0.9 percent, at 2,362.9

   The market received additional impetus from the release of
British money supply data for November, which showed that the
government efforts to keep a tight grip on Britain's money supply
may be succeeding.
   The market was also led forward earlier in the day by the end
December Financial Times-Stock Exchange futures contract, which at

   Southwest Airlines will reduce many of its long
distance air fares through mid-March, the company announced.
   Southwest on Tuesday also placed a $99 ceiling on any one-way
fare purchased 21 days ahead of travel Mondays thru Thursdays and
Saturdays.
   In announcing the fares, Southwest marketing vice president
Donald G. Valentine pronounced the Dallas-based carrier the ``price
policeman'' of the airline industry.
   Under the reduction, customers must buy tickets by Jan. 20 and
travel between Jan. 6 and March 15. Customers using the rates may
not fly on Friday or Sunday, but there is not a Saturday night stay
requirement nor a minimum time before the customer can return.
   Fare reductions of up to 20 percent are also being put in place
on one-and seven-day advance purchases on flights generally of 600
miles or longer, Valentine said.
   Southwest is the nation's eighth largest carrier, serving 31
airports in 14 states.

   Hourly paid workers at the Ford Motor Co. Ltd. on
Wednesday voted 4-1 to strike unless the management improves a pay
offer within a month, union officials said.
   The Transport and General Workers' Union said 20,343, or 81

voted to strike.
   The unions have rejected Ford's latest two-year contract
proposal of a 9.5 percent pay raise in the first year and a raise
of 2.5 percent plus inflation in the second.
   Ford unions are seeking a minimum 10 percent raise in the
first-year and a cut in the working week to 35 hours from 39 hours.
   Jack Adams, union chairman of the Joint Negotiating Committee,
said officials have not set a date to begin a strike.
   Wednesday's mandate to strike will lapse after 28 days, under
British law.

<HEAD>Toyota Reportedly Expects Record Domestic Sales in 1990</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Toyoda is correct for president's name.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toyota Motor Corp. expects its 1990 domestic sales
to grow 8 percent from this year while exports remain stable,
President Shoichiro Toyoda was quoted as saying Wednesday.
   Surging domestic demand will boost domestic sales for a seventh
consecutive year, to a record 2.48 million vehicles next year
compared with this year's estimated sales of 2.30 million, Kyodo
News Service quoted Toyoda as telling reporters.
   The predictions of Japan's largest automaker come in the face of
recent loss of market share due to the brisk performance of Nissan
Motor Co., Japan's No.2 automaker, which has been cutting into
Toyota's dominance in the domestic market, Kyodo noted.
   ``The strong growth expectation reflects Toyota's efforts to
recover its shrinking share in the domestic market in recent
years,'' Kyodo quoted Toyoda as saying.
   Toyota officials did not answer telephone calls Wednesday
evening.
   While Toyota's 8 percent domestic sales growth outpaces Nissan's
estimate of 4 percent growth in domestic sales to 1.37 million
vehicles next year, Nissan officials announced Tuesday they expect
overseas production to grow a hefty 7 percent in 1990 to 683,000.
   The Kyodo report did not quote Toyoda as mentioning Toyota's
overseas production.
   Toyota's exports are expected to remain flat at some 1.68
million units next year, Toyoda was quoted as saying.
   Nissan officials said their exports next year would increase
slightly by 0.2 percent to 1.07 vehicles.
   Toyota, which currently accounts for 41.8 percent of total
domestic sales, plans to boost its share to around 42.8 percent,
Kyodo quoted him as saying.
   Nissan says its share of Japan's is 23.8 percent but that it is
aiming for 30 percent, with growth of about 1 percent a year.

   Hospital Corp. of America has stopped a
plan to sell its psychiatric hospital division to the unit's
employees because financing could not be obtained, the company said.
   The sale of HCA Psychiatric Co. and its 53 hospitals was to have
been completed by the end of the year. No other offers are before
the company, said Victor L. Campbell, vice president of corporate
relations.
   The $1.23 billion sale was to have been financed through an
employee stock ownership plan, with HCA retaining a 10 percent to
30 percent stake in the new company.
   ``We've been working on this since the summer and there have
been a multitude of things that have taken place, primarily in the
financial markets,'' Campbell said Tuesday.
   ``The bond markets have weakened somewhat and a lot of
legislation related to ESOPs and original discount securities has
been passed,'' he said.
   James K. Don, president of HCA Psychiatric, has resigned and the
psychiatric units will become part of HCA's network of 78
medical-surgical hospitals in the United States, Campbell said.
   HCA is paying back a $1.3 billion loan used to finance a $3.6
billion management-led buyout of the company earlier this year. HCA
has already paid $260 million through the sales of various units.

   Property developer and airline owner Donald
Trump is among about half a dozen bidders who are considering a
purchase of Campeau Corp.'s Bloomingdale's department store chain,
according to a report published today.
   Susan Heilbron, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization,
declined to comment today on the report in The Wall Street Journal.
   The newspaper said Trump and the other bidders have advanced to
the second stage of the bidding process and will be given access to
detailed financial information about the 17-store chain.
   In addition to Trump, the bidders include shopping center owner
JMB Realty Corp. based in Chicago, Japan's Tokyu Department Store
Co. and a group led by Joseph E. Brooks, chairman of the Ann Taylor
stores, the Journal said, citing unidentified sources.
   An investment group headed by Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin
Traub also is among the bidders although the group doesn't have a
financial partner yet, the newspaper said. Ira Millstein, an
adviser to Traub and a senior partner with the law firm Weil,
Gotshal &amp; Manges, told the Journal the group is engaged in serious
discussions with potential partners.
   A sixth bidder, possibly Japanese, also is believed to be
involved in the bidding, the Journal said.
   Campeau put Bloomingdale's up for sale in September as part of
plan to cope with a cash squeeze.
   The company announced on Dec. 8 that the initial stage of the
sale process had been concluded and that no more than five or six
bidders would advance to the second round. A definitive
announcement on the sale of New York-based Bloomingdale's is
sometime in February, Campeau said.
   Campeau, a Canadian company based in Toronto, has said detailed
information about the bidders would not be disclosed and that all
negotiations would be kept confidential. Spokeswoman Carol Sanger
couldn't be reached early today.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American businesses operating in Panama
scrambled today to assess the impact of the U.S. military invasion,
closing some offices and checking whether the fighting endangered
their employees.
   The government estimates 35,000 Americans live in Panama, many
of whom work for U.S. corporations.
   Texaco Inc. said only that all the company's employees are safe.
``That's all we're prepared to say ... it's just too preliminary to
make any other comment,'' he said.
   Texaco owns a large refinery in the Colon area, near the Panama
Canal. The refinery has a capacity to handle 100,000 barrels of
crude each day.
   Citicorp closed the six branches it operates in Panama City
today. ``We're still trying to find out whether anybody's
affected,'' said spokesman Ken Campbell.
   Merrrill Lynch &amp; Co., one of a number of firms to leave Panama
following U.S. sanctions against the country announced in 1988,
moved its operations to the Cayman Islands last year.
   The Panama Canal, where about 30 ships cross the isthmus daily,
was closed at 1 a.m. because of the fighting, according to Panama
Canal Commission spokesman Franklin Castrellon.
   Shipping analysts would not speculate on how long the canal
could be closed and noted that alternate routes and other forms of
transportation could help diminish the impact if the canal were
closed for an extended period of time.
   ``The amount of traffic going through the canal is probably not
going to cause the economy to collapse,'' said Mark Degenhart, an
analyst with Argus Research Inc.
   ``Goods shipped in containers can be transshipped by railroads''
from the west coast to their east coast destinations, he said.
   Companies with ships en route to the canal are proceeding as
usual in hopes that the canal will be opened by the time their
ships arrive.

   In trying to evaluate a mutual fund as a
prospective investment for the 1990s, anyone might naturally start
by asking, ``how has it done in the '80s?''
   Steeped as they may be in the old doctrine that past performance
is no guarantee of future results, experienced investors
nevertheless want to see what a fund's managers have demonstrated
they can accomplish.
   Ten-year periods, furthermore, provide a convenient reference
point for people who are pursuing long-term financial goals. Any
fund that can turn in good results over such a protracted span
presumably has something going for it beyond luck or a fleeting hot
streak.
   Conversely, experts on the subject say, a fund that couldn't
flourish in the lush financial climate of the 1980s ought to have
some explaining to do before you entrust your money to it for the
years ahead.
   But with all that, some advisers say, you can go astray by
putting too much reliance on long-term past performance in the
process of picking a fund.
   For one thing, notes Sheldon Jacobs, publisher of the advisory
letter The No-Load Fund Investor in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y., if
you insist on a 10-year record these days you are going to
eliminate a great many possibilities right off the bat.
   Among the 241 diversified stock funds he follows, Jacobs says,
more than half didn't start operating until 1980 or later, and
nearly a third have gone into the business since 1985. ``That's a
lot of potentially outstanding funds to ignore,'' he observes.
   In the mutual fund game, many analysts say, young up-and-comers
often enjoy a special edge on their older competition.
   While they are still small to medium-sized, they tend to be lean
operations that can enhance the results they achieve with a
relatively small number of well-timed investments.
Long-established, popular funds can become encumbered by their own
sheer size.
   In recognition of this problem, several of the industry's stars
closed their doors to new investors for lengthy intervals in the
'80s, striving to keep their growth at a manageable pace.
   Some big funds that have kept on scoring top marks, such as the
eminently successful Fidelity Magellan Fund, have been widely
publicized. But industry commentators often cite them as the
exception that proves the rule.
   On top of that, Jacobs suggests, the outstanding years in a
fund's past may have been the work of a manager or managers who
have since moved on to other endeavors. ``It's not uncommon for old
funds to have new managers,'' he says. ``The manager is the key,
not the fund.''
   In the universe of the funds he follows, only one in five has
been operating with the same people at the helm for 10 years or
more.
   For a final test of his argument, Jacobs checked actual
performance records of new vs. older funds for various periods in
more recent times through the third quarter of this year.
   On the list of the top 25 performers since the beginning of
1986, 56 percent were funds organized in 1980 or later. For the
period since the lows after the 1987 market crash, the newcomers'
share swelled to 80 percent. Over the most recent 12 months, it
stood at 60 percent.
   Jacobs's conclusion: Age discrimination is unwarranted when
shopping for a mutual fund. ``Young funds are no problem,'' he
says, ``as long as they are performing well.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Gain On Export News</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat futures prices were slightly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board, reflecting new export
developments, but other grain and soybean futures were narrowly
mixed in listless trading.
   The wheat market got a boost from the Agriculture Department's
announcement late Tuesday that it had targeted the Soviet Union for
sales of another 2 million metric tons of wheat at subsidized
prices in addition to the 14,200 tons remaining under a previous
allocation.
   A new wheat allocation to the Soviets has been expected since
President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met earlier this
month.
   ``We knew it was coming; we didn't know when,'' said Susan
Leighty, grain market analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
in New York.
   In other export news, the USDA announced sales of wheat to
China, Turkey and Egypt, and Japan was rumored to have bought U.S.
wheat overnight.
   Further support stemmed from Tuesday's USDA announcement that an
additional 3.3 million acres of land had been taken out of
agricultural production and put into a soil conservation program.
Ms. Leighty said about 2 million of those acres were in wheat
country.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $4.15{ a bushel; corn
futures were \ cent lower to } cent higher with March at $2.38{ a
bushel; oats were \ cent lower to \ cent higher with March at $1.53
a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 1\ cents higher with
January at $5.78 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were lower in early
trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Pork belly futures were
down sharply amid speculation that Thursday's weekly USDA cold
storage report would show a higher-than-normal net increase last
month in supplies of frozen bellies.
   Live cattle futures were .02 cent to .15 cent lower with
December at 78.90 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .20 cent higher with January at 84.52 cents a pound; live hogs
were .10 cent to .50 cent lower with December at 53.35 cents a
pound; frozen pork bellies were .80 cent to 1.25 cent lower with
February at 50.35 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

<HEAD>American Jumps Into Latin America Through Eastern Purchase</HEAD>

   In one stroke, American Airlines has become a
significant international carrier through the $471 million purchase
of Latin American and European routes and other assets from
struggling Eastern Airlines and its parent, Texas Air Corp.
   The long-anticipated deal, announced Tuesday, increases
American's Central and South American destinations from one city in
Venezuela to 20 in 15 countries. It also gives American its second
London route in two days and Eastern's unused route authority from
Miami to Madrid, Spain.
   American Chairman Robert L. Crandall said today the deal will
allow American to ``fully realize our aspirations'' in Latin
America and Eastern to gain badly needed cash as it tries to emerge
from Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   In a news conference in Miami today, noted that the deal must be
approved by the U.S. Department of Transportation, but added, ``We
certainly think it should be (approved) ... This is a very good
transaction.''
   American, besides being the No. 1 domestic airline, serves seven
Mexican destinations and about 20 in the Caribbean, plus has a
growing presence in Europe, where it has 5 percent of the market,
and the Pacific.
   The agreement followed by one day American's $195 million
purchase from Trans World Airlines Inc. of a Chicago-London route,
plus facilities at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. In
addition, American paid $400,000 Monday for Braniff's landing
rights at Chicago and New York.
   All the purchases require approval by various government
agencies. In addition, the Eastern transactions must be approved by
a U.S. Bankruptcy Court judge in New York.
   ``American has been pursuing the expansion of its international
operations from some time,'' Crandall said Tuesday. ``This
transaction will allow our company to continue building its
international network, and it will make the United States a
stronger competitor in Central and South America by linking that
region to American's extensive domestic route system.''
   The purchase includes gates at several U.S. airports currently
held by Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines, plus
Eastern facilities at U.S., Puerto Rican and South American
airports.
   As part of the agreement, Continental will drop a $1 billion
antitrust lawsuit against Sabre, the computer reservation system
owned by American's parent, AMR Corp. of Fort Worth.
   Texas Air, based in Houston, said the deal would pump $349
million into Eastern, which is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy
court protection next year.
   Continental, which is selling is Miami-London route, will
realize $102.5 million; System One, Texas Air's computer
reservations system, will net $19.5 million through the sale of
telecommunication and data processing systems needed to service the
Latin American routes.
   ``The sale of these assets will enable Eastern Airlines to
continue on its course of successfully rebuilding as a smaller and
stronger airline for the future, with its operations centered at
its Atlanta hub,'' Texas Air said in a statement.
   Eastern also said it would sell the 14 Lockheed-1011s it uses on
the Latin American routes. The planes, which are an older, smaller
version of the widebody jet, could bring in about $200 million,
according to analysts' estimates.
   American, which has spent billions this year buying new aircraft
to serve its expansion plans, says it is not interested in the jets.
   Analysts generally applauded American's purchases of the routes.
They say the carrier's expansion beyond U.S. borders is necessary
if it is to become a ``player'' internationally.
   The deals also could have the pleasant side effect of making AMR
less attractive to a corporate raider by decreasing cash and
depressing earnings.
   ``These are good long-term moves, and if they affect earnings in
the short term, they can deal with that,'' said analyst Mark
Daugherty at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   Analyst Helane Becker of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. sounded a
warning note, however.
   ``I really think that you don't necessarily want to take $500
million or $200 million cash and give it to a competitor that would
be out of business in a year,'' she said, referring to Eastern and
TWA. ``You sort of have to wonder if they could buy these assets
out of bankruptcy at a cheaper price than they're doing today.''
   AMR shares closed Tuesday at $60, up $2.75, in New York Stock
Exchange trading.
   American has been expanding vigorously this year, buying
airplanes to fly its newly acquired, or sought-after routes;
beginning work on a $400 million maintenance facility; expanding
domestic operations; and fighting off a takeover from billionaire
Donald Trump.
   American has broadened its European service significantly this
year, and already has approval for more routes next year, when it
will reach about 165 flights weekly to 18 European cities.
   Six years ago, it flew to none.
   Expansion also is under way in the Pacific, where American next
year will begin flying to Sydney, Australia and Auckland, New
Zealand. The airline also is trying to add a second Tokyo flight.
   The growth has been financed through record profits, although
Crandall has warned the performance won't continue this quarter or
next year.

<HEAD>Southeastern Asset Increases Saatchi Stake to 11.2 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Saatchi &amp; Saatchi Co. PLC, the world's largest
advertising holding company, said Wednesday that the investment
company Southeastern Asset Management has increased its stake in
the troubled company to 11.2 percent.
   Southeastern, based in Memphis, Tenn., had previously declared
on Sept. 18 that it owned a 10.2 percent stake in Saatchi.
   Its president O. Mason Hawkins was quoted Wednesday in the
Saatchi news release as saying the stake-building indicated his
company's support for Saatchi's management.
   ``We are long-term investors who seek to find undervalued
companies, which have management determined to achieve substantial
profit improvement and to enhance shareholder value,'' Hawkins said.
   Southeastern has increased its shareholding to 17.788 million
ordinary shares, Saatchi said.
   A Saatchi official, who didn't want to be identified, said
company officials ``welcome long-term holders in the company and
Hawkins is obviously in that category.''
   Some analysts have speculated that Southeastern is taking its
stake in the hope that Saatchi eventually will become the subject
of a bid.
   Earlier this month, Saatchi reported a net loss of 58.5 million
pounds, or $94 million, for the year ended Sept. 30, reflecting
troubles in its consulting business which the company has placed up
for sale.
   It recently appointed a new chief executive, French businessman
Robert Louis-Dreyfus.

   The surprise attack by U.S. forces in Panama helped push the
dollar higher today, but other financial markets reacted only
mildly to the military intervention.
   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up about 4
points to the 2,700 level by noon EST. But in the broader market,
declining stocks slightly outnumbered advances on the New York
Stock Exchange.
   U.S. Treasury bond prices were unchanged to slightly higher in
midday trading in New York.
   President Bush ordered troops into action following several days
of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a U.S.
military officer in Panama by defense forces controlled by Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Currency dealers said the dollar rose sharply against other
major currencies just after the military action became known early
today.
   In Japan, the dollar closed at 144.23 yen, up 0.43 yen from
Tuesday. It started the trading day at 143.92 yen and ranged
between 143.90-144.25 yen. By midday in Europe, the dollar was up
against all currencies except the yen while gold prices moved
higher.
   The dollar remained firm in early New York dealings.
   In times of international tension, investors often look for safe
havens and usually turn to the dollar and precious metals.
   Gabriele Schmitt, a trader with the Bank of New York, said she
expected the dollar to be stable in the near term because of the
uncertainty in Panama.
   ``There are still a lot of question marks,'' she said. ``Noriega
still has a lot of support in his country ... I wouldn't rule him
out entirely.''
   But stock analysts said most investors did not view the unrest
in Panama as a reason for making big changes in their strategies.
   ``The initial reaction is one of a non-event. It might have an
impact if it becomes a prolonged situation,'' said Dennis E.
Jarrett, a technical analyst with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   Larry Wachtel, a vice president for Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc., agreed: ``We've been involved in limited (military)
engagements before. This looks like a military engagement that will
be over shortly.''
   Wachtel said oil and defense stocks were getting a boost from
the Panama invastion, however.
   The oil futures market initially rallied on the news amid
concern that the closure of the Panama Canal might disrupt oil
shipments, but prices fell back later in the trading session.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was
down around 5 cents at $21.21 per 42-gallon barrel by midday today.
   The January home heating oil contract, strengthened in recent
days from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation, was up 0.54
cent to 76.85 cents a gallon, after rising nearly 2 cents earlier
in the trading session.
   ``I think the reaction to the Panama closure was totally
irrational,'' said Bob Baker, an energy analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. ``Our crude oil supplies simply
won't be disrupted.''
   Baker said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to the
United States passes through the Panama Canal and the tankers that
travel through the canal could be re-routed around South America.

   State Comptroller Gerald Lewis today
began legal action to remove David L. Paul as chairman of CenTrust
Bank of Miami, claiming Paul has used Florida's largest savings and
loan to support his ``opulent lifestyle.''
   Lewis filed an administrative complaint that seeks removal of
Paul as chairman of the thrift. Paul has 21 days to either contest
the complaint through a state hearing or comply with it.
   CenTrust said it would oppose efforts to oust Paul and called
Lewis' action was self-serving.
   ``This campaign is clearly aimed at generating favorable
publicity for the comptroller and supporting his own re-election
campaign whatever the cost to CenTrust, its shareholders and its
customers,'' the company said in a statement.
   The complaint charged that Paul used CenTrust employees to
perform personal services, charged the savings and loan for
thousands of dollars in personal bills and engaged in other
questionable financial transactions.
   ``Paul maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of
the association, and generally treated a federally insured
financial institution and public company as it if were his own
public piggy bank,'' Lewis said in the complaint.
   Paul's actions were unsound and unsafe business practices that
violated his duty as an officer of a financial institution, the
complaint charged.
   The complaint was filed 11 days after federal regulators, also
citing CenTrust's lavish spending practices, ordered the
institution to stop squandering its assets on fine art, sailboats,
excessive executive salaries and other personal expenses.
   Terence McElroy, spokesman for the comptroller's office, said
the action today was highly unusual.
   ``But it's a fairly unusual institution,'' McElroy said.
   The complaint questioned Paul's $4.8 million in salary between
January 1988 and September of this year during a time when the
thrift suffered operating losses of $76 million before taxes.
   CenTrust also bought some $30 million in art in 1988 without
Lewis' approval, spent thousands of dollars on executives' hotels
bills and used high-prices limousines to ferry the thrift's
officers around Miami, the complaint charged.
   The complaint also noted that $150,000 in CenTrust assets,
including security equipment, video cameras, office supplies,
telephones and air conditioners, were kept at Paul's home on La
Gorce Island in Miami.
   When federal regulators made their charges earlier this month,
Paul issued a statement saying he had turned around a previously
insolvent thrift and reduced its losses.
   ``We have achieved that without one penny of federal assistance
while investing millions of dollars in developing a first-rate
institution with the financial strength in place to meet the need
of our customers,'' Paul said at the time.

<HEAD>Economy Grew At an Annual Rate of 3 Percent July Through September</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 11 grafs new to include Fed actions; picks up at pvs 10th

<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3
percent from July through September, the government said today, but
analysts say it has slowed dramatically during the fourth quarter.
   The economic deterioration has led many anlaysts to urge the
Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy.
The central bank did add money to the banking system late Tuesday,
leading to the belief that it might permit interest rates to fall
again.
   In its final report on third-quarter economic activity, the
Commerce Department said the gross national product was revised
upward 0.3 percentage point from the 2.7 percent rate reported last
month.
   Many economists had predicted no change from November in the
figure released today.
   The change was attributed to another upward revision in net
exports and a downward revision in personal consumption.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic health.
   The report bore good news for the Fed's goal of restraining
inflation. A price index tied to the GNP rose at an annual rate of
2.9 percent during the July-September period, unchanged from last
month's report.
   It is the Fed's high-interest policy that is blamed, in part,
for the fourth-quarter sluggishness, particularly in the automobile
and other manufacturing industries.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank's
policymaking arm, met privately Monday and Tuesday to consider
monetary policy but, as usual, did not announce whether it would
permit rates to continue to fall.
   However, the key federal funds rate, the interest banks charge
each other for overnight loans, dropped to 8 7-16 percent from
about 8{ percent late Tueday. Analysts said they expected a target
of 8\ percent for the rate.
   Besides manufacturing sluggishness, other disruptions in
fourth-quarter growth are expected from the Boeing aircraft strike,
the lingering effects of Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco
Bay-area earthquake.
   In a companion report, the Commerce Department said after-tax
profits of U.S. corporations fell 5.4 percent in the third quarter.
That was a revision from the 7.2 percent decline reported last
month.
   Corporate profits have dropped for three consecutive quarters.
They were down 0.3 percent in the first quarter and 1.1 percent in
the second.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, was revised to show a 5.6 percent growth rate compared to
the 6.2 percent gain reported last month.
   The various changes left the GNP expanding in the third quarter
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.16 trillion.
   Today's report was the third on the July-September GNP. In its
initial estimate in October, the Commerce Department said the
third-quarter economy would grow at a 2.5 percent annual rate.
   Last month's initial revision was due mainly to
better-than-expected trade performance. The September trade
deficit, which hit a five-year low, was not available when the
advance estimate was made in October.
   Today's revision reflects additional data that has become
available.
   While the economy surprised many analysts with its 3 percent
growth durin the first nine months of the year, it has declined
significantly this quarter and some economists fear it will drop
below 1 percent and perhaps even trip into a recession.
   The administration is forecasting a 2.7 percent growth rate for
all of 1989. The fourth-quarter GNP would have to advance 1.6
percent to meet that goal.
   Much of the growth in the third quarter was attributed to robust
automobile sales that were driven by sales incentives. Automakers
dropped the incentives with the introduction of 1990 models in
October and sales plummeted.
   But David Berson, chief economist for the Federal National
Mortgage Association, noted that incentives are being restored and
predicted a pickup in sales starting in January.
   The Fed's high-interest policy is intended to curb inflation. As
inflation appeared to moderate, the central bank has gradually
eased interest rates since last June.
   But many economists say rates still are too high and are
stifling growth, even threatening an end to an unprecedented seven
years of peacetime growth.
   ``Fourth-quarter growth is about 0.8 percent,'' said Donald
Ratajczak, economic forecasting director at Georgia State
University. He said growth in the first three months of 1990 will
be about 1 percent.
   ``But I'm expecting a couple of prime rate cuts, and if we don't
see them we might turn our forecast to the negative,'' he said.
   Robert Brusca, chief financial economist for Nikko Securities
Co. International Inc., also suggested the Fed should consider
further easing interest rates.
   ``I think the Fed will have to move to reduce interest rates in
order to keep the economy going next year, but I think they're
going to have to do it slowly,'' he said.

<HEAD>Parent Of Jim Walter Corp. Faces Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hillsborough Holdings Corp., the parent
company of Jim Walter Corp., said today it was prepared to file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if its bondholders did not agree
to financial restructuring.
   Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co. of New York acquired
Hillsborough Holdings as part of its $2.4 billion acquisition of
Jim Walter last year. The Tampa-based building materials company is
currently fighting a $3 billion asbestos-related lawsuit.
   The proposed bankruptcy move would be the first involving a
large company acquired by Kohlberg Kravis, the leader among
leveraged buyout firms, and could have an effect on the junk bond
market that has financed many takeovers.
   Hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected
to be made Dec. 27 if an exchange offer for $624 million worth of
the company's bonds were not accepted by at least 80 percent of the
company's bondholders.
   Kohlberg Kravis has apparently failed to persuade a group of
Hillsborough's senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial
restructuring of the company.
   ``If the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their
current terms and conditions, Hillsborough and certain of its
subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary
petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11,'' said David
Townsend, Hillsborough Holdings spokesman.
   If the offer is not accepted, Hillsborough faces the prospect of
having to repay its notes in full, which it told bondholders at a
meeting Tuesday that it could not do.
   Hillsborough's financial problems began last summer when it was
named in the class-action lawsuit.
   Because of the suit, Kohlberg Kravis has been unable to sell off
Jim Walter's assets. And without the proceeds from the sales, the
company cannot meet its upcoming debt payments.

   The dollar was mixed against major foreign
currencies Wednesday in hectic but thin European trading after the
U.S. military intervention in Panama.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Traders said the dollar was boosted early in the trading day by
the U.S. military action and by an unexpected upward revision in
the third-quarter U.S. economic growth rate.
   The dollar stabilized later in the day, traders said, and then
slipped back in mild profit-taking.
   ``We think (the Panama situation) is very much a smoke screen
and an excuse to buy dollars,'' said one London dealer. ``If the
market was genuinely frightened from the news, why didn't gold also
gain?''
   Investors traditionally turn to the dollar and gold as safe
havens in times of turmoil.
   Traders cautioned against drawing too many conclusions from
dollar movements in the market, thinned by the holiday season.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 144.23 Japanese yen from
143.80 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it fell to 143.90
yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6052 from $1.6005 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.7355 West German marks, down from 1.7365;
1.5585 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 5.9165 French francs, down
from 5.9300; 1.9720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9575; 1,288.00
Italian lire, down from 1,291.25; and 1.1625 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1613.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid price of $413.50 a troy ounce,
down from $413.75 bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $413 dollars, down
from $414 dollars bid late Tuesday.
   In Hong Kong, gold fell 76 cents to close at a bid $412.04.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $5.56 a
troy ounce, down from $5.57 bid late Tuesday.

   Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading
Wednesday, as the market reacted with enthusiasm to Wall Street's
recovery from its Tuesday lows.
   Selective buying, the re-emergence of takeover speculation in
the composite insurance sector, and the continuation of a stock
shortage also helped the market, dealers said.
   Still, the market was lethargic despite good volume, dealers
said.
   ``People are conscious of the strengths of the market, but many
are still happy to sit on the sidelines,'' said one dealer, adding
that business was winding down ahead of the approaching holidays.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed 18.6
points, or 0.8 percent, higher at 2,360.7.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 13.5 points at 1,866.0
at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 7.53 points
to close at 1,280.69.
   Volume amounted to a healthy 552.9 million shares compared with
589.2 million shares Tuesday.

   Political instability and a staggering economy
are threatening to bust Beijing's booming market for foreign-office
space.
   Dozens of highrise office buildings are opening in the capital
this year and next, at a time when many overseas companies are
reducing operations in China or putting off new investment.
   ``It's going to be survival of the fittest,'' said James R.
Pitchon of Richard Ellis, property consultant for the World Trade
Center, Beijing's biggest building project. ``We have a baby market
here, and things have been made worse by the current economic
situation.''
   Pitchon estimated that by the end of 1990 there will be nearly
double the amount of office space currently required by the 1,100
foreign companies with offices in Beijing.
   It will be a drastic turnaround from even a year ago, when more
than half of all foreigners were working out of Chinese hotel rooms
with peeling paint, antiquated telephones and stalled elevators.
   Foreign companies began moving representatives into Beijing
around 1980 with the advent of Deng Xiaoping's economic reforms and
open door policy. But it was not until 1985, with the opening of
the 29-story China International Trust and Investment Corp. (CITIC)
building, that a select few companies had their first access to
modern office space.
   In 1986 the Holiday Inn Lido complex of hotel, apartments and
offices opened for businessmen and the next year the 23-story Noble
Tower, a project marked by bitter disputes between its Chinese and
Canadian partners, began taking in tenants.
   But that still provided only about 57,000 square yards of office
space. By next year, the figure will be five times as great.
   Heading the newcomers is the World Trade Center, a joint venture
with Hong Kong-based Kerry Industrial Co. That features a 38-story
tower with 61,000 square yards of office space, two 30-story luxury
apartment buildings and two hotels with more than 1,000 rooms.
   Among the competition is the Jing Guang Center, a 51-story
office-apartment-hotel built with Hong Kong and Japanese
participation; the 20-story Fortune Building financed by Japan's
Nomura Securities Group; the Hua Wei Center, a Norwegian-Chinese
apartment-business project with 23,000 square yards of office
space; and Capital Mansion, a CITIC undertaking with a 52-story
office-apartment building.
   Their openings, however, are clouded by the June military
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement and an austerity policy
that has stalled the economy and left in doubt the future direction
of China's market-oriented reforms. Few companies have left China,
but many have trimmed expatriate staff or canceled plans for
further investment.
   Many foreign businesses likely will wait one or two years before
deciding the extent of their commitment to China, some real estate
experts say, and investing in costly new office quarters will not
be a top priority.
   Most of the projects are months behind schedule because of
typical construction delays in China compounded by work stoppages
during the political turmoil of this spring. The World Trade,
originally slated to cost $380 million, now will require $450
million due to expense overruns.
   Many projects, such as the two-tower Asia-Pacific Building
financed partly by Singaporean and Japanese funds, have asked for
rescheduling of loans and extensions of joint venture contracts
because of expected slow returns on investment.
   The Chinese partner in the World Trade Center, the Ministry of
Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, has already agreed to extend
the life of the joint venture from 20 to 30 years.
   At least one major project, a planned 17-story hotel and office
building involving the Japanese builder Takenaka Komuten,
Mitsubishi Bank and Japan Air Lines, halted construction after June.
   ``We haven't abandoned the project,'' Takenaka spokesman Fujio
Takeuchi said in Tokyo. But he said the project team is waiting for
the domestic situation in China to return to normal.
   Another project, CITIC's Capital Mansion, has been hit by
construction delays and financing problems and, according to some
foreign real estate experts, is a ``white elephant.''
   Capital Mansion Deputy General Manager Yang Long said the
building will not open until the end of 1990. He expressed
confidence the project would succeed, but said it isn't signing
contracts yet and ``we face serious competition.''
   ``It's a race against time,'' said George P. Maier, chief
operations officer of the Jing Guang Center. Those already taking
in tenants have a big advantage, he said.
   The Jing Guang began filling its offices and apartments in
December and the World Trade Center will have 115 tenants, about 60
percent occupancy, by the end of January.
   The Fortune Building, promoted by its Japanese managers as a
high-technology office complex with a satellite transmission
network, has about 40 mostly Japanese tenants and foresees
occupancy of about 65 percent next year.
   The Norwegian Hua Wei Center, which won't open until next
summer, has leased only 20 percent of its office space and like
many others is offering ``flexible terms'' to attract customers.
   The center is asking $35 per square yard a month, but Sales
Manager Dorophy Leung said ``this price is negotiable and we will
offer discounts.''
   The World Trade Center has also cut its rates from near $40 to
about $35 a square yard.
   Office buildings also may face competition from newly built
hotels, which face an even greater glut in the near future because
of the post-June collapse of the tourist market. The State
Council-owned Capital Hotel, with an occupancy rate of 30 percent,
recently began advertising guest suites for use as offices.
   According to one survey, there will be about 24,000 rooms in
Western-style hotels in Beijing by 1991, double that of 1988 and
seven times the figure in 1983.
   Developers said the oversupply problem should eventually work
itself out, but much depends on China's political stability and
economic health. ``It could be a boom town,'' said the World Trade
Center's Pitchon. ``And it could be a ghost town.''

   Upjohn Co. said Wednesday it would phase
out production of industrial chemicals at a North Haven, Conn.
plant and take a $200 million charge against fourth-quarter
earnings to reflect that and other restructuring steps.
   Upjohn would scale back production at the plant and planned to
sell its industrial chemical product lines and technologies next
year, Chairman Theodore Cooper said in a statement.
   ``The industrial chemical business no longer fits our corporate
strategy,'' Cooper said, adding that the North Haven plant had
become unprofitable because of a number of factors, including
obsolescence, competition and shrinking markets.
   Most of the 178 jobs at the plant would be phased out by the end
of 1992, some through normal attrition and early retirement
incentives, the company said.
   Upjohn said 65 percent of the $200 million charge was
attributable to the phaseout of the North Haven plant, while the
other 35 percent was due to a previously-announced special
retirement plan and other one-time expenses.
   Industrial chemicals include benzephonone, used in soaps and
perfumes, DCNA, used in dyes and as an agricultural fungicide, and
dichlorobenzidine, used in making yellow ink and dye pigments,
Upjohn spokesman J.P. Lambrechts said.

<HEAD>Next For Nintendo: Keeping Fan Loyalty</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On a conference room wall at Nintendo of
America Inc.'s headquarters hangs a 20-foot-long picture frame,
crammed with hundreds of snapshots and school photos of children.
   They're pictures kids just sent on their own, says Nintendo
spokesman Bill White, usually with a note about how they did on a
Nintendo video game.
   For a company that gets thousands of photos, tens of thousands
of letters and millions of phone calls from customers, 1990 may
pose a problem: How to keep that loyalty.
   With a Nintendo Entertainment System in one out of nearly four
American households, toy industry watchers wonder whether the
market is getting saturated.
   ``I look at Nintendo as a fad that is moving into its fourth
year,'' says Paul Valentine, an analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.
in New York. If for no other reason, he said, that makes Nintendo
vulnerable to a slump.
   ``We've certainly seen the predictions of the doomsayers that
we've reached saturation,'' says White. ``That certainly hasn't
been the case.''
   Nevertheless, gamesters and marketeers at Nintendo are hustling
to keep their top-selling toy fresh among customers. Beyond
scouting new and more detailed games, ideas range from ``store
within a store'' retail displays to marketing tie-ins with Pepsi to
a feature-length movie.
   This Christmas, Nintendo introduced its hand-held game, ``Game
Boy,'' which it hopes will sell 1 million units. It forecasts
selling 9 million of the entertainment system consoles this year.
   By late 1990, Nintendo plans to have its ``NES Network''
running, which will allow the machines to be used to trade
securities and mutual funds through Fidelity Investments and for
game players to compete in nationwide tournaments.
   At Nintendo's U.S. headquarters in this Seattle suburb, the
bustling hallways, jingling phones and jammed shipping docks during
the Christmas selling season testified to the prosperity of a
company that's had the nation's No.1 toy the past three years.
   The subsidiary of Nintendo Co. Ltd. of Japan projects more than
$2.7 billion in retail sales for 1989, $1 billion more than last
year and nearly nine times as much as in 1986.
   This year, NEC Home Electronics (U.S.A.) Inc. and Sega of
America Inc., also subsidiaries of Japanese companies, brought out
competing machines offering more computing power than Nintendo's.
Atari Corp. also has introduced a competitor to Game Boy, called
Lynx.
   Still, Nintendo claims a 79 percent share of a video game market
it estimates at $3.4 billion. Its Japanese parent may introduce a
more high-powered system in Japan next summer, White said.
   Nintendo expects to have sold 20 million video game systems by
the end of this year, with the devices in 22 percent of all U.S.
households.
   But Valentine said he thinks sales will drop sharply in 1990.
Toy crazes, he says, just don't last over three or four years.
   ``I think when the fad goes we'll see a sharp contraction of
sales, anywhere from 40 to 70 percent over two years,'' he said.
Still, he said, that would leave video games as the largest
category within the toy industry.
   Many toy makers are hoping Nintendo crashes, says Larry Carlat,
editor of Toy and Hobby World magazine. ``It probably will be down,
but a lot of it is wishful thinking,'' he said.
   ``No company has been really able to hold onto a smash and be
able to manage it in the past. It's always been a boom and bust
cycle,'' Carlat said. ``It doesn't look like that is going to
happen with Nintendo. People in the toy business use the term `soft
landing.'''
   Nintendo introduced its game system in 1983 in Japan and has
sold it to 37 percent of households there. The goal, Nintendo says,
is similar market penetration in North America and Europe.
   Nintendo has been credited with reviving the video game
industry, which had all but vanished by the early 1980s because of
poor quality software. It did so by carefully contolling licensing
and manufacture of the games that can be played on its system.
   White says there are encouraging signs of market longevity in
the United States. Two years ago, he said, 75 percent to 80 percent
of the primary users of Nintendo games were boys aged 6 to 14. The
interest has broadened, he said, so that segment only represents 46
percent of the main users today.
   Men 18 and older now make up 30 percent of the primary users,
while women and girls comprise a 24 percent share, White said.
   ``The biggest change has been the widespread adoption of the
Nintendo Entertainment System as a true entertainment option'' to
television, video cassettes or stereos, he said.
   Nintendo does its best to cultivate fan loyalty, White says. It
has 400 game counselors at its U.S. headquarters, who handle
140,000 calls a week from stumped players.
   Its magazine, Nintendo Power, has 1.8 million subscribers. The
company gets 15,000 letters a week, and a roomful of writers
responds to each personally.
   ``You've got to bond with them,'' White says.
   So far, Nintendo has lent its name to 200 licensed products,
from sweatshirts to dolls, bedsheets to breakfast cereal. It's also
set up about 5,000 ``World of Nintendo'' store displays to sell the
merchandise.
   In addition, there are two television series. Earlier this month
a Nintendo-themed movie, ``The Wizard,'' opened nationally.
   While the licensing earns money, it also is a powerful marketing
tool for Nintendo, White said. Likewise, he said, a Christmas-time
promotion with Pepsi broadens Nintendo's advertising.
   White, however, said the tie-ins and licensing deals still are
secondary to the core of the industry, the games.
   Nintendo has sold 101 million individual games, and hopes for a
new hit when it brings out Super Mario Bros. 3 next year, a far
more intricate version of this year's best-selling game, he said.

<HEAD>Soybeans Lead Crop Futures Lower In Thin Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by moderate
losses in the soybean market linked in part to the closing of the
Panama Canal.
   But Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the decline in soybean prices mostly
represented a continuation of a seasonal trend.
   Trading activity was very light, with many traders getting an
early start on the holiday weekend.
   The Panama Canal was closed to traffic Wednesday as U.S. armed
forces launched a surprise assault in Panama in an attempt to
capture Panamian leader Manuel Noriega.
   Shipments of U.S. soybeans to Japan pass through the Panama
Canal. But Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the closing of the canal was ``a pretty minor
factor'' in the market's decline.
   ``It certainly is premature to think any serious or permanent
export disruption would be caused by it,'' she said.
   Soybean prices had slipped lower in the two previous trading
sessions.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.13\ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at $2.38{ a bushel; oats
were { cent to } cent lower with March at $1.52 a bushel; soybeans
were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with January at $5.74\ a bushel.

   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. said Wednesday that
Michael A. Miles had been elected as a vice chairman and a director
of the food, tobacco and brewing giant and chairman of its biggest
division, Kraft General Foods.
   Miles' election to the posts had been expected in the wake of
the announcement Sept. 27 that John M. Richman planned to retire
from those posts at the end of the year.
   Miles, 50, has been president and chief executive of Kraft
General Foods, the maker of products such as Miracle Whip salad
dressing, Velveeta cheese, Maxwell House coffee, Jell-O desserts
and Oscar Mayer meats.
   The company expects the foods business will account for more
than half the corporation's revenues of about $45 million this year.
   Philip Morris' other divisions are the Philip Morris USA tobacco
company and Miller Brewing Co.
   With Miles' election to the board, the board expands to 22
directors from 21. The company has two vice chairmen _ the other is
R. William Murray.
   Philip Morris' chairman and chief executive is Hamish Maxwell
and its president is John A. Murphy.
   Miles joined Kraft Inc. as president and chief operating officer
in 1982 and stayed on in those posts after Philip Morris acquired
Kraft in late 1988.
   He has previously been senior vice president of foods at
Heublein Inc. and was chairman of what was then Heublein's Kentucky
Fried Chicken Corp.
   Before joining Heublein in 1971, Miles worked for 10 years with
the advertising agency Leo Burnett Co. in Chicago.

Wednesday to confirm Trump's interest.
   Campeau spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the company intends to
maintain silence for the duration of the sale process. The identity
of the bidders will not be disclosed and all negotiations are
confidential.
   The only thing the company has been willing to say in the past
is that no more than five or six parties would advance to the
second stage of the bidding. No word on who will acquire the
17-store upscale chain is expected until sometime in February,
Campeau said on Dec. 8, the day the initial stage of the sale
process was concluded.
   Susan Heilbron, a spokeswoman for the Trump Organization, also
declined to comment on a report Wednesday in The Wall Street
Journal that said Trump is one of the bidders who will advance to
round 2.
   Trump is known primarily as a property developer. Included in
his vast holdings are an airline and a stake in a New York
department store chain, Alexander's.
   Alexander's announced on Wednesday that, at the urging of Trump
and another stockholder, the retailer had hired the investment
banking firm Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. to ``consider strategic
alternatives to maximize stockholder value, including the possible
sale of the company.''
   The retailer said there was no assurance that any transaction
would occur.
   Ms. Heilbron dismissed speculation that Trump might favor a sale
of Alexander's to raise money to help pay for Bloomingdale's. She
said Trump and Steven Roth, who each own 27.2 percent of
Alexander's, have been advocating changes for years in the way
Alexander's has been run.
   She said she wouldn't rule out the possibility that Trump might
pursue a takeover of the share of Alexander's he doesn't already
control. Alexander's operates 11 stores in the New York
metropolitan area.
   Besides Trump, the bidders for Bloomingdale's include shopping
center owner JMB Realty Corp. based in Chicago, Japan's Tokyu
Department Store Co. and a group led by Joseph E. Brooks, chairman
of the Ann Taylor stores, the Journal said, citing unidentified
sources.
   An investment group headed by Bloomingdale's Chairman Marvin
Traub also is among the contenders, a spokeswoman for the chain,
Katie Locke, said.
   Ira Millstein, an adviser to Traub and a senior partner with the
law firm Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, told the Journal that the Traub
group is trying to arrange financing for a possible bid. He said
the group is engaged in serious discussions with potential
financial partners.
   A sixth bidder, possibly Japanese, also is believed to be
involved in the bidding, the Journal said.
   Campeau, a Canadian real estate company with extensive retail
holdings in the United States, was forced to put Bloomingdale's up
for sale in September as part of a plan to cope with a severe cash
squeeze and an enormous debt load.
   Among the stores besides New York-based Bloomingdale's under
Campeau's corporate umbrella are: Abraham &amp; Straus, Burdines,
Lazarus, Rich's, The Bon Marche, Jordan Marsh and Stern's.

<HEAD>State: Thrift Chairman Used Deposits as `His Own Public Piggy Bank'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CURT ANDERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State officials took action Wednesday
to oust the head of Florida's largest savings and loan, claiming he
used $45 million in depositors' money to bankroll an art collection
and extravagant lifestyle.
   David L. Paul, chairman and chief executive officer of CenTrust
Bank of Miami, has 21 days to resign or contest a complaint filed
by Comptroller Gerald Lewis. A statement released by CenTrust said
Paul would ``vigorously oppose'' removal.
   ``Paul maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of
the association and generally treated a federally insured financial
institution and public company as it if were his own public piggy
bank,'' Lewis said in the complaint.
   The complaint claimed Paul violated his duty as officer of a
financial institution by using CenTrust employees to perform
personal services, charging the company for personal bills and
buying luxuries.
   It cited $30 million in art bought with CenTrust funds,
including $12 million paid for Peter Paul Rudens' ``Portrait of a
Man as Mars.'' Some of the paintings were kept at Paul's Miami
Beach home before state regulators ordered them sold.
   The complaint also questioned Paul's $4.8 million salary from
January 1988 to September 1989, when the thrift suffered pre-tax
operating losses of $76 million.
   CenTrust said in a statement the charges were not justified and
the thrift had improved net worth signficantly during Paul's six
years in charge, and accused the comptroller of a ``campaign of
harassment and disinformation.''
   CenTrust, with $9 billion in assets, is Florida's largest thrift
and the 22nd largest in the country. It has 70 branches, most in
south Florida.
   But the thrift has steadily lost money for more than a year,
including $9.1 million in the quarter ended Sept. 30.
   The comptroller's complaint was filed 12 days after federal
regulators, also citing CenTrust's lavish spending practices,
ordered the institution to stop squandering assets.
   The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision barred CenTrust from
increasing executives' salaries, ordered it to sell a $233,000
sailboat and prohibited CenTrust from spending any more money on
Paul's yacht, the Grand Cru.
   Other expenses questioned by Lewis include:
   _A $6.1 million CenTrust loan to Paul to buy and improve his
house and property, as well as payment by CenTrust of telephone,
garbage and lawn bills in 1986-87.
   _A $5 million executive retirement system begun in 1986 with
deposits in an English bank. Lewis contends the system has
insufficient documentation.
   _$1.4 million a year to lease a corporate jet and hangar at
Miami International Airport as well as $26,000 a year for a
Mercedes-Benz limousine, $40,000 to purchase a Lincoln limousine
kept in New York and $33,000 in other car expenses.
   _$363,000 for security guard service at Paul's home the past two
years.
   _$150,000 in bank assets kept at Paul's home, including security
equipment, video cameras, office supplies, telephones and air
conditioners.
   _$47,000 spent by Paul in 1988 during a 35-night stay at a New
York hotel. The average daily expense was $1,186.
   CenTrust has sought federal approval to sell 63 branches and
their accounts to Great Western Financial of Beverly Hills, Calif.
CenTrust also is planning to convert from a state charter to a
federal charter.

   The energy futures market ended mixed in
volatile trading Wednesday, erasing much of its earlier gains that
stemmed from news of a sudden U.S. military strike in Panama.
   Prices for crude and refined petroleum products had been up
sharply earlier in the trading day Wednesday on fears that the
closure of the Panama Canal, following the surprise attack by
American forces, might disrupt oil shipments.
   But analysts said the market had over-reacted.
   ``I think the reaction to the Panama closure was totally
irrational,'' Bob Baker, an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache,
said. ``Our crude oil supplies simply won't be disrupted.''
   Analysts said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to
the United States passes through the Panama Canal because the
waterway is too small to handle large tankers.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the February contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the leading grade of U.S. crude oil, was
down 7 cents to settle at $21.21 per 42-gallon barrel. The contract
was up 11 cents on Tuesday.
   Among refined petroleum products, the January wholesale home
heating oil contract, supported in recent days from a cold spell
that hit parts of the nation, rose 0.75 cent to settle at 75.76
cents a gallon. On Tuesday, the contract gained 0.35 cent.
   January wholesale unleaded gasoline, which lost 0.58 cent in the
previous session, ended 0.71 cent lower to 53.22 cents a gallon.

   The stock market drifted through a trendless
session Wednesday, registering no strong reaction to the U.S.
military action in Panama.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 7.68 to
2,687.93, extending its loss over the last five trading days to
73.16 points.
   But advancing issues nosed out declines in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 759 up, 749 down and
492 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 176.52 million
shares, down from 186.06 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 216.34 million shares.
   Analysts said investors were cautiously watching the situation
in Panama, but apparently not viewing it as any cause to make big
changes in their strategies.
   They noted that the prospective economic effects of the
confrontation, if any, remained unclear.
   At the same time, brokers said, stock traders appeared to draw
only brief encouragement from an upward revision in the latest
government figures on economic growth.
   The Commerce Department said the gross national product grew at
a 3.0 percent annual rate, after adjustment for inflation, in the
third quarter of the year, up from a previous estimate of 2.7
percent.
   Economists' projections remained gloomy, however, for the
results to be posted in the fourth quarter and the early stages of
1990.
   Citytrust Bancorp, which became the latest northeastern regional
banking company to increase its reserves against bad loans because
of a weak real estate market, fell 3 to 11. Citytrust also said it
was eliminating its quarterly dividend.
   Walt Disney tumbled 11] to 112 in selling attributed to
recession worries and a warier appraisal by some analysts of the
company's earnings outlook.
   Stride Rite dropped 3} to 23{ on word from the company said its
earnings for this year and next were likely to come in on the low
side of estimates.
   Late in the day, however, an investor group said it proposed to
buy Stride Rite for $32 a share.
   Helene Curtis Industries fell 3| to 25}. The company reported
earnings of 28 cents a share for the fiscal quarter ended Nov. 30,
down from 40 cents in the like period a year earlier.
   Among actively traded blue chips, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph
dropped 1\ to 44\; Philip Morris \ to 40[; McDonald's | to 32~;
International Business Machines [ to 94|, and General Electric ] to
62].
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.55 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .14 to 189.54.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index slipped .60 to 391.86, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up .38 at 342.84.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
rallied 2.59 to 436.94. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 368.18, up .23.

   The dollar finished mostly lower Wednesday in
foreign exchange trading in the United States after ending mixed
overseas in what dealers called a muted response to the U.S.
military intervention in Panama.
   Gold investors appeared to discard news of the military action,
as prices edged higher in New York after falling in Europe and
Asia. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for a troy
ounce of gold at $413.05 as of 4 p.m. EST, up $1.30 from Tuesday's
late bid.
   The dollar wound up lower against every major currency except
the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar in New York. In Europe, it
rose against the yen, Canadian dollar and Dutch guilder, but fell
against other major currencies.
   Dealers in Europe said the dollar rose early in the trading day
in reaction to news of the U.S. military action in Panama.
   But the dollar reversed course midway through the U.S. trading
day when the Federal Reserve took steps to inject reserves into the
financial system, a move that was viewed as a sign that it may be
encouraging lower interest rates.
   Falling interest rates reduce demand for dollars because the
decline cuts the yields available to foreigners on their
dollar-denominated investments.
   Richard Levine, vice president for foreign exchange and precious
metals at Elders Futures Inc. in New York, said trading was
relatively light all day.
   ``You could tell there was no real conviction,'' he said,
referring to the market's assessment of the impact of both the
military action and the Fed's move to make more money available
within the financial system.
   He said the market viewed the U.S. military action as ``a sign
of strength'' but recognized the move was a ``limited regional
action'' which was not likely to have global ramifications.
   The subsequent decline in the dollar also came on low volume,
Levine said, because traders remember that they misinterpreted a
similar move by the central bank a few weeks ago as an indication
it was easing its credit policy.
   He also noted that as the end of the year approaches, banks that
otherwise would be active in the currency markets are not trading.
``Most of the major banks have squared their banks for the year,''
he said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 144.23 Japanese yen from 143.80 yen
at Tuesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted at 143.90 yen.
In New York, the dollar edged up to 143.93 yen from 143.65 yen late
Tuesday.
   The dollar fell against the British pound. In London, the pound
rose to $1.6052 from $1.6005 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound
rose to $1.6060 from $1.6010 late Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Tuesday, included: 1.7320 West German marks, down from 1.7365;
5.9125 French francs, down from 5.9275; 1.5555 Swiss francs, down
from 1.5565; 1,288.50 Italian lire, down from 1,289.25; and 1.16095
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16085.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Tuesday's prices, included: 1.7355 West German marks, down from
1.7365; 1.5585 Swiss francs, down from 1.5615; 5.9165 French
francs, down from 5.9300; 1.9720 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9575;
1,288.00 Italian lire, down from 1,291.25; and 1.1625 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.1613.
   On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery
rose $1.70 a troy ounce to $413.60.
   But earlier in the day, gold prices fell. Gold dropped to a late
bid of $413.50 a troy ounce in London from $413.75 bid late
Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid of $413 an
ounce, down from $414 late Tuesday. In Hong Kong, gold fell 76
cents to close at a bid $412.04.
   On the Comex, silver for current delivery rose 2.1 cents an
ounce to $5.548. Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid of
$5.56 an ounce, down from $5.57 late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Stock Offering Withdrawal Shows Market Weakness</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   European food concern TLC Beatrice International
Inc.'s decision to scrap a public stock offering to raise up to
$194 million reflects a general weakness in the market for new
issues, analysts said Wednesday.
   The move also postponed what would have been two firsts: the
first former Beatrice Cos. holding to go public since a $6 billion
takeover in 1986 and the first black-owned company to be listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
   TLC Beatrice on Tuesday canceled the offering of 18.5 million
shares of stock priced from $9 to $10.50 a share. A successful
offering would have raised between $167 million and $194 million.
   The company, controlled by investor Reginald F. Lewis, cited
weak market conditions and a lack of interest from institutional
investors in canceling the plan to offer a 35 percent interest to
the public.
   ``It's not what I would call a hot new issues market,'' said
Norman Fosback, president of the Institute for Econometric Research
in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., which analyzes new stock issues.
``Offerings tend to be overpriced.''
   ``My sense is that there is very little demand for offerings
from individual investors, and institutions are dominating the
market,'' said Fosback, who did not recommend the TLC Beatrice
issue.
   Robert Baumbach, a new issues analyst for Standard &amp; Poor's
Corp., said in a report that the TLC Beatrice shares were priced at
about 20 times what he estimated the company's 1989 earnings would
be if it already were public.
   There have been 194 initial public offerings by companies this
year through Tuesday, down from 222 in the same 1988 period and 516
in the same 1987 period, according to Securities Data Co.
   The value of IPOs rose 4.3 percent from 1988 to $5.5 billion,
but dropped 56.6 percent from $12.8 billion in the 1987 period, the
figures showed.
   A group of investors led by Lewis bought Beatrice's
international foods operations for $985 million in December 1987.
The entire company was taken private the previous year by Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts Co., the leader in debt-financed takeovers known as
leveraged buyouts.
   TLC Beatrice raised $875 million through asset sales to help pay
off debt, company officials said. They said the remaining $34
million in acquisition debt was retired this week, but the company
still has close to $170 million in long-term debt.
   As of Sept. 30, the company had assets of $624 million,
including about $154 million in cash. It expects 1989 operating
profits of $75 million on sales of $1.1 billion.
   ``The market for initial public equity offerings has tightened
up in general,'' TLC Beatrice senior vice president Everett Grant
said.
   ``We thought it was an attractive window to access the public
equity markets,'' he said. ``However, the window did not appear as
attractive as it might have been.''
   Grant said the company has not ruled out issuing the stock at a
later time.
   TLC Beatrice owns 15 companies, including Franprix, a food
wholesaler in the Paris area; Tayto, Ireland's largest snack food
company; and seven ice cream distributors in Europe.

<HEAD>Orange Juice Futures Climb Higher On Freeze Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Orange juice futures prices climbed higher Wednesday on the New
York Cotton Exchange as fears of a weekend freeze in the Florida
citrus belt intensified.
   On other commodity markets, sugar futures fell sharply; coffee
futures gained in reaction to the U.S. military action in Panama;
precious metals advanced; energy futures were mixed; grains and
soybeans fell; and livestock and meat futures retreated.
   Futures prices for frozen concentrated orange juice settled 1.9
cents to 3.05 cents higher with the contract for delivery in
January up 2 cents at $1.3445 a pound.
   Freezing temperatures are almost certain to reach Florida's
citrus region this weekend as one of the most powerful cold-air
masses of the decade lumbers down from Canada, said Jon Davis, a
meteorologist who tracks the impact of the weather on commodities
for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
   ``This air mass is so strong that even the fringe of it has
potential to cause some damage across the citrus belt,'' Davis
said. ``Now it's just a matter of how much damage.''
   The coldest temperatures, ranging from the lower 20s in the
northern reaches of the fruit region to the lower 30s in the south,
are expected on Friday night and Saturday night, Davis said.
   With temperatures that cold for an extended period, he said,
trees could be damaged as well as fruit, which could cut into
production for years to come.
   Sugar futures prices plunged on the New York Coffee, Sugar &amp;
Cocoa Exchange in reaction to a Brazilian court ruling that could
result in a rapid movement of supplies out of Brazil.
   A Superior Court on Tuesday overturned the Brazilian
government's decision to withhold sugar export licenses from three
trade houses in a bid to divert sugar to the nation's fuel alcohol
program.
   Sugar futures finished .32 cent to 1.14 cents lower with January
at 12.76 cents a pound.
   Coffee futures prices made strong gains in New York on supply
concerns prompted in part by the U.S. military action in Panama.
   The Panama Canal was closed to traffic Wednesday as U.S. armed
forces launched a surprise assault in Panama in an attempt to
capture Panamian leader Manuel Noriega.
   The incident created uncertainty about coffee shipments from
Central America.
   Coffee futures settled 1.12 cents to 2.13 cents higher with
March at 78.14 cents a pound.
   The military action in Panama also helped boost precious metals
futures on New York's Commodity Exchange.
   Gold futures settled $1.40 to $1.70 higher with December at
$413.60 a troy ounce; silver was 1.8 cents to 2.6 cents higher with
December at $5.448 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures finished mixed after initially surging on the
Panama news. But heating oil for near-term delivery continued its
dramatic rally, rising for the 15th of the last 16 sessions on
weather-driven worries about tightening supplies.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 10 cents
lower with February at $21.21 a barrel; heating oil was .59 cent
lower to .75 cent higher with January at 75.76 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .71 cent lower with January at
53.22 cents a gallon.
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by moderate losses in the
soybean market linked partly to the closing of the Panama Canal.
   Wheat futures settled unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at
$4.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1\ cents lower with March at
$2.38{ a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with March at
$1.52\ a bushel; soybeans were 3} cents to 6 cents lower with
January at $5.73} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures finished lower, led by limit losses
in the pork belly market amid disappointment over the government's
slow pace in buying pork bellies to ship to Poland and expectations
that monthly USDA report due out on Thursday will show a net
increase in supplies of frozen bellies.
   Live cattle settled .10 cent to .55 cent lower with December at
78.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .15 cent lower
with January at 84.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 cent to .85
cent lower with December at 52.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.90 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 49.60
cents a pound.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines chairman Robert L. Crandall said
Wednesday his deal to buy foreign routes and other assets of
Eastern Airlines should be approved by government regulators ``in
the national interest.''
   Failure to allow the deal would invite greater control of
international air travel by foreign carriers, Crandall said a press
conference called to discuss details of the $471 million purchase
announced Tuesday.
   The complex deal with Eastern parent Texas Air Corp. gives
American control of Eastern's prized Latin American routes and
would greatly enhance American's presence in foreign markets.
   The purchase is subject to review by the Justice and
Transportation departments and the U.S. Bankruptcy Court overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization.
   ``We think it benefits consumers, the citizens of Miami,
American's shareholders and employees ... (and) benefits every U.S.
citizen,'' Crandall said.
   Some U.S. officials, including Transportation Secretary Samuel
Skinner, have expressed qualms about whether international route
authorities, granted by governments, should be sold.
   Crandall said the deal gives Eastern needed cash as it
reorganizes into a carrier that is focusing on Atlanta and would
give the international routes to a carrier that can ``use them more
effectively.''
   Since foreign governments restrict the number of U.S. carriers
allowed to fly to their countries, Eastern's financial difficulties
presented American with ``a major opportunity'' to realize its
ambitions to become a major international carrier. American wants
to expand in the Pacific, he added, but Japan remains very
restrictive.
   ``American is a fast-growing company and we plan to continue
that expansion through the 1990s,'' Crandall said.
   The price of shares in American's parent AMR Corp. lost $1.25 to
$58.75 on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday.
   The leader of Eastern's Machinists union, which began the
crippling March 4 strike that led to Eastern's filing for Chapter
11 bankruptcy five days later, said the proposed deal should be
rejected.
   ``Quite honestly, I don't look for this thing to get any quick
approval,'' Charles E. Bryan said. ``If there's any credibility
with Skinner and the Department of Justice people, I would highly
doubt that thing would be approved.''
   But, Bryan said, ``It seems that (Texas Air chairman) Frank
Lorenzo gets what he wants in Washington. He seems to have
Washington completely wired.''
   If government review results in approval of the deal, American
officials said, American's daily departures out of Miami will rise
from the current 41 to about 80 in the second half of 1990. The
increase would include 25 more daily domestic departures.
   Eastern, which says it is ``de-hubbing'' its home city, is
Miami's No. 1 carrier with 76 daily departures.
   Crandall said American's expansion in Miami will add about 2,000
jobs there. American plans to absorb some 2,600 to 2,700 employees
in the Latin American countries American will begin serving,
American officials said.
   American spokesman Ed Martelle said the total includes all
Eastern employees in those countries, employees of four South
American ground handling companies in which Eastern had interest,
and employees of the Texas Air computer reservations system, System
One.
   Peter Dolara, an American senior vice president, said American
would consider hiring some of the more than 2,000 Eastern pilots
who were told the carrier had no jobs for them when they ended
their strike last month. Dolara said, though, there was no
commitment to hiring any Eastern employees other than the ground
personnel already working for Eastern in the Latin countries.
   The deal increases American's Central and South American
destinations from one city in Venezuela to 20 in 15 countries. The
package also includes a London route and Eastern's unused authority
to fly from Miami to Madrid, Spain.
   Besides being the No. 1 domestic airline, American serves seven
Mexican destinations and about 20 in the Caribbean. It also has a
growing presence in Europe, where it has 5 percent of the market,
and the Pacific.
   The purchase includes gates at several U.S. airports currently
held by Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines, plus
Eastern facilities at U.S., Puerto Rican and South American
airports.
   As part of the agreement, Continental will drop a $1 billion
antitrust lawsuit against SABRE, the computer reservation system
owned by AMR. Crandall said American paid full value for the Texas
Air and Eastern assets, not extra money to settle the litigation.
   Texas Air said the deal would pump $349 million into Eastern.
Continental, which is selling the Miami-London route, will realize
$102.5 million. System One will net $19.5 million through the sale
of telecommunication and data-processing systems needed to service
the Latin American routes.

   Two former executives of the Enron Oil Corp.
were charged Wednesday with conspiring to defraud the company
through a series of phony oil trading transactions.
   The defendants were charged in federal court in White Plains,
N.Y., a New York suburb. They agreed to plead guilty at a later
date, said U.S. Attorney Otto Obermaier.
   The former Enron executives are Louis Borget, who was the
president and chief executive officer, and Thomas Mastroeni, the
vice president and secretary-treasurer.
   The alleged phony transactions took place in 1985 and 1986
before both men left Enron Oil, a subsidiary of the Houston-based
Enron Corp., in 1987. Enron Oil Corp. is located in the Westchester
County community of Valhalla.

<HEAD>Completes Corporate Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ramada Inc. Wednesday announced completion of a
corporate restructuring that includes the sale of its worldwide
hotel business and formation of a new company to operate its New
Jersey and Nevada casinos.
   Ramada shareholders approved the revised restructuring plan
earlier this month, agreeing to accept $1 and one share of stock in
the new company, Aztar Corp., for each share of Ramada stock.
   Gaming regulators in Nevada and New Jersey approved the plan a
short time later.
   Hong Kong-based New World Hotel (Holdings) Ltd. acquired
Ramada's more than 800 hotels and the Ramada name for $540 million.
   The company said it will operate 108 international hotels,
including 14 Ramada Renaissance hotels in the United States, under
the name Ramada International Hotels, and Prime Motor Inns Inc., of
Fiarfield, N.J., will operate or franchise Ramada Inns in the
United States and Rodeway Inns worldwide.
   Wilfried Grau, president and chief executive officer of the new
Ramada International Hotels, said New World acquired the Ramada
hotel business to quickly increase its share of the worldwide
market.
   ``In Hong Kong, New World is a highly regarded hotelier known
for its ownership stake in the Landmark Regent Hotel, rated one of
the top 10 in the world,'' Grau said. ``Once they decided to
develop their hotel interests on a global basis, rather than start
from scratch, they opted to buy an existing international name with
strong management.''
   Ramada International Hotels will be based in Hong Kong, but its
regional office for North America will be in Phoenix, Grau said.
   Aztar, the new company created by the restructuring, will
operate the Tropworld Casino and Entertainment Resort in Atlantic
City, N.J.; Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Nev.; and
Ramada Express Hotel and Casino in Laughlin, Nev.

<HEAD>Parent of Jim Walter Corp. Faces Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jim Walter Corp.'s parent company said
Wednesday it was prepared to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection in what would be a first among large firms taken private
by buyout specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co.
   Kohlberg Kravis formed Hillsborough Holdings Corp. as part of
its $2.4 billion takeover of the building materials company last
year. A bankruptcy court filing by the company could inject fresh
jitters into the junk-bond market that has financed such takeovers.
   Hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected
to be made Dec. 27 if an exchange offer for $624 million worth of
the company's bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of the
company's bondholders.
   Kohlberg Kravis has apparently failed to persuade a group of
Hillsborough's senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial
restructuring of the company.
   ``If the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their
current terms and conditions, Hillsborough and certain of its
subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary
petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11,'' said
Hillsborough's spokesman David Townsend.
   If the offer is not accepted, Hillsborough faces the prospect of
having to repay its notes in full, which it told bondholders at a
meeting Tuesday that it could not do.
   A Chapter 11 filing would blemish the record of Kohlberg Kravis,
considered the dean of the leveraged buyout artists with the $25
billion RJR Nabisco deal to its credit. But the Hillsborough firm
has some peculiar problems, which are not necessarily symptomatic
of widespread weakness among LBOs, experts said.
   ``It's not going to be that devastating,'' said James Grant,
publisher of a New York interest rate newsletter and a critic of
leveraged buyouts. ``Hillsborough Holdings had problems of its own
that had nothing to do with the takeover.''
   The biggest problem, Grant said, came last summer when Jim
Walter was hit with a $3 billion asbestos-related lawsuit. Because
of the class-action suit, Kohlberg Kravis has been unable to sell
off Jim Walter's assets. And without the proceeds from the sales,
the company cannot meet its upcoming debt payments.
   Hillsborough is the third company owned by Kohlberg Kravis to
encounter financial difficulties in recent months.
   In August, Kohlberg Kravis confirmed that Seaman Furniture Co.,
a leading furniture retailer, could not meet its debt payments and
might not be able to continue operating. The company's debt
payments were later rescheduled successfully.
   SCI Television Inc., of which Kohlberg Kravis owns 45 percent,
is also involved in an exchange offer that is facing resistance
from bondholders.
   But neither of those Kohlberg Kravis holdings is as large as
Hillsborough.

   A judge on Wednesday refused to dismiss charges
that the president of Rite Aid Inc. tried to bribe an Ohio State
Pharmacy Board member to resign.
   Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Judge Lillian J. Greene set a
tentative trial date of Jan. 15 for Martin L. Grass, who heads the
nation's largest drugstore chain.
   Grass, 35, and his attorneys appeared in court Friday to ask
Greene to drop the charges.
   Grass has denied government charges that he and Rite Aid, based
in Shiresmantown, Pa., were trying to get members onto the pharmacy
board who would ensure the company's interests.
   A secret Cuyahoga County grand jury indictment was unsealed Aug.
1, accusing Grass and Rite Aid of offering a $33,000 bribe to
Melvin Wilczynski, a member of the State Board of Pharmacy.
Prosecutors contend the money was to be in exchange for
Wilczynski's stepping down from the board.
   Rite Aid has maintained that it paid Wilczynski $33,249 for a
legal buyout of his consulting contract with Lane Drug Co., a
division of Peoples Drug Stores Inc. Rite Aid acquired Peoples Drug
in April.

<HEAD>Clothing Makers Join Companies Suspending Business With Campeau</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two clothing makers have joined merchandise
credit firms in suspending business with Campeau Corp.'s Federated
and Allied department stores as a result of Campeau's financial
situation.
   Finity Sportswear Ltd. president Stanley Stern said that if the
retailers seek protection from creditors in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,
his company would have to demand prepayment on its next shipment,
which is Jan. 20.
   ``A delay in our payment would be very devastating,'' he said.
   Federated and Allied, based in Cincinnati, warned in documents
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission that they could
run out of operating cash as early as January if lenders do not
restructure their $7 billion debt.
   Herman Gordon, senior vice president of Leslie Fay Cos., said
the company wants to continue business with Federated and Allied,
but cannot risk having the retailers seek protection in bankruptcy
court.
   ``We'd have to settle claims with something less than a full
amount. That is a risk we cannot afford to run,'' Gordon said.
   Solo Credit Service Corp. on Tuesday began advising clients,
including clothing manufacturers and companies that lend money to
finance merchandise shipments, not to ship goods to Campeau stores.
   ``Campeau's intention to do business is very sincere, but their
liquidity problem has turned into a very dangerous situation that
needs to be addressed immediately,'' said Richard Hastings, a Solo
credit analyst.
   Solo's advice came after CIT Group-Factoring and Heller
Financial, merchandise lenders, cut off credit to such
Campeau-owned stores as Lazarus, Bloomingdale's and Jordan Marsh.
   Carol Sanger, Campeau's vice president for corporate
communications in Cincinnati, said the company was withholding
comment on the companies' decisions.
   Liz Claiborne Inc., Bernard Chaus and Heckler Manufacturing &amp;
Investing Inc. are continuing shipments.
   ``We strongly believe management there will resolve this
situation and any questions will be answered,'' said Heckler
executive vice president Marcy Allen. The firm makes Calvin Klein
underwear and girl's sportswear under the Adrienne Vittadini label.

<HEAD>Lang Plans to Make Ms. an Ad-Free Bimonthly Magazine, Names New Editor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new owner of Ms. said Wednesday he plans to
resume publication of the magazine every other month starting next
spring, and named feminist activist and author Robin Morgan as its
editor in chief.
   Dale W. Lang, whose Lang Communications Inc. assumed control of
Ms. in mid-October, had previously disclosed that when the magazine
resumed publication, it would no longer accept advertising and he
reaffirmed that on Wednesday.
   The magazine, founded in 1972, had been a monthly but was not
profitable and had often been at odds with advertisers over its
editorial content.
   Lang had said publishing the magazine without ads would relieve
it from ``external pressures'' and enable its editorial staff to
concentrate on pursuing issues important to women without concerns
about advertiser backlash.
   The last issue of Ms. magazine was dated November. No specific
date was set for resumption of publication as a bimonthly.
   Lang was unavailable for comment on the latest decisions, but a
spokeswoman said that subscribers would soon be getting a letter of
explanation from Gloria Steinem, a co-founder of the magazine who
remains a consultant to the publication.
   Spokeswoman Andrea Kaplan said Ms. Steinem would outline the
plans for Ms. and offer readers a chance to get issues of Working
Woman, Working Mother or similar magazines in the months remaining
before Ms. resumes publication.
   Lang Communications owns Working Woman and Working Mother as
well as the teen magazine Sassy and Success, a magazine for
entrepreneurs.
   Ms. Morgan, the new editor, replaces Anne Summers, who had held
that post since November 1987 and remains as editor-at-large of the
magazine.
   Ms. Summers had been part of a group including management that
bought Ms. and Sassy in July 1988 from the Australia-based media
company John Fairfax Ltd.
   Terms of Lang's acquisition of a controlling interest in that
company have not been disclosed.
   Ms. Morgan has written 12 books, including ``The Demon Lover: On
the Sexuality of Terrorism,'' ``Sisterhood is Powerful'' and
``Sisterhood is Global.'' She was a contributing editor to Ms. from
1974 to 1987.
   She also was described as a founder and leader of the feminist
movement in the United States and was a creator of the Sisterhood
is Global Institute, a feminist research organization.
   She was said to be unavailable for comment on her new job.
   Asked why Lang felt a new editor was needed for the magazine,
Ms. Kaplan said he felt ``a new editor will have a fresh
perspective on the magazine.''
   The last issue of Ms. had actress Glenn Close on the cover, but
Ms. Kaplan said the new Ms. would no longer rely on celebrity
interviews or profiles.
   ``It's going to be a hard-hitting, journalistic magazine,'' she
said.
   Industry observers have said they expect Ms. will scale back its
circulation base of 550,000 when it resumes publication.

<HEAD>Ford Announces New Incentive Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday announced a
new incentive program that doubles some cash rebates and adds two
full-size cars to the list of affected vehicles.
   The news reflected the increasing problems automakers face
because of slow sales and a sluggish economy, which has forced them
to sharply curtail production plans.
   Ford's announcement came the day after Vice Chairman Harold
Poling said he hoped the industry would return to the days when
vehicles were sold on their merits instead of on cash-back offers
and cut-rate financing. Ford officials said there was no conflict
between Poling's comments and the incentive program.
   Like other automakers, Ford provides incentives to dealers in
addition to the advertised customer incentives. Dealer incentives
may be used at the discretion of the dealer for advertising,
marketing or passing along to consumers.
   Ford's new incentive program includes rebates ranging from $500
to $4,000, depending on vehicle, and interest rates ranging from
4.8 percent to 10.9 percent, depending on model and length of loan.
   The program is in effect until Feb. 5.
   Last Friday, Chrysler Corp. announced a new incentive program
significantly boosting cash rebates. That program expires Jan. 31,
but the company guaranteed that if rebates are increased later,
Chrysler would make up the difference in the rebate for anyone
buying a vehicle between now and the end of next month.
   For the first time, Chrysler put incentives on its popular
minivans.
   Ford's announcement Wednesday included incentives for the first
time on its full-size Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis
cars. Interest rates on Ford's minivan, the Aerostar, were lowered
to a range between 4.8 percent and 10.9 percent, depending on the
length of the loan.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday put off a hearing
on Mobil Oil Corp.'s request to keep under seal environmental
documents filed in a lawsuit brought by a former executive, who
says he was fired for refusing to ``sanitize'' pollution reports.
   U.S. District Judge Harold A. Ackerman said he wanted to give
Mobil's attorneys a chance to prepare arguments for their
opposition to a request by The Associated Press to enter the case.
   Ackerman was to hear arguments Wednesday on whether or not to
make the documents public. Stephen Wiley, an attorney for the
former employee, said he favors unsealing the documents because
they are ``directly relevant'' to a public proceeding.
   An attorney for the AP, Richard Eittreim, said his arguments
were similar to Wiley's. But Mobil attorney Ron Green said he
wanted to respond to the AP's legal papers, which he received
shortly before the hearing.
   Ackerman set a new date for Friday and told the parties to
submit more papers.
   The former employee, Valcar Bowman Jr., claims he was fired as
Mobil Chemical Co.'s environmental affairs manager for refusing to
``sanitize'' assessments of environmental problems at company
plants nationwide. He claims the company's legal office made
changes to downplay pollution problems.
   Bowman, 47, of Riverdale, Ga., worked at the Princeton offices
of Mobil.
   Mobil denies the charge, saying it had a right to fire Bowman
and did so as part of a legitimate economic cutback. The company
also denies altering the reports other than to make a few minor
editing and typographical changes.
   The parties dispute whether Ackerman should unseal a series of
environmental assessment reports submitted in support of arguments
made in the pre-trial stages.
   Wiley says the whole documents are central to his case. Mobil
says it is willing to release only portions it feels are relevant,
and to release the entire reports _ which are self-critical
evaluations _ would stifle attempts by companies to be candid about
conditions at their plants.

<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian company has agreed to buy the
heating and air conditioning division of the Coleman Co., Coleman
said Wednesday.
   A Coleman spokesman said the financial terms of the deal with
Beacon International Ltd. of Toronto wouldn't be announced. The
transaction is scheduled to be completed in early 1990.
   Beacon International is a subsidiary of Beacon Capital Corp., a
small holding company.
   Coleman officials said the 650 workers in the division likely
won't notice much change under the new owner.
   There had been fears a Coleman competitor would buy the division
and move it or close it.
   In addition to a Wichita plant with more than 1 million square
feet of manufacturing and office space, the division has a smaller
factory employing 96 workers in Nacodoches, Texas, and a
distribution center in Tornoto.
   Gross division sales in 1988 were $124.8 million.
   Coleman has been trying to sell the division and several other
units since Wall Street investor Ronald O. Perelman acquired the
company from the Coleman family earlier this year.
   In November, Coleman's Crosman Products unit was sold for $41
million to an investor group that included senior managers from the
division.
   A tentative deal for the sale of the Coleman Camping Trailers
division is awaiting finalization.

<TEXT>
   TLC Beatrice International Inc., a food company
controlled by investor Reginald F. Lewis, said Tuesday it had
scrapped plans to sell a 35 percent stake to the public.
   The company cited unfavorable stock market conditions for
abandoning the plan, which was intended to raise as much as $194
million.
   Lewis said the offer might have been poorly timed.
   ``The time of the year and the market conditions right now were
both factors,'' he told The New York Times. ``Also, my sense is
that there is now not much awareness in the institutional investor
community about what is going on in Europe, or our company and how
it fit into the picture in Europe.''
   The underwriters of the proposed offering, Merrill Lynch Capital
Markets, also advised TLC Beatrice to withdraw the offer, the
company said.
   The offering would have made TLC Beatrice the first
black-controlled company on the New York Stock Exchange. It also
would have left Lewis with 58 percent of the shares. He now has 55
percent.
   Lewis created the company by acquiring the international
operations of the former Beatrice Cos. for $985 million in 1987.
