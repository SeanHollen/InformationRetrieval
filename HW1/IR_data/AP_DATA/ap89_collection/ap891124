   A former East German policeman was sentenced
to 14 months in prison Friday for injuring a protester detained
during a pro-democracy mass demonstration last month, the state
news agency ADN said.
   An East Berlin court also ordered the man, identified by ADN
only as Horst L., to pay damages to be set later.
   Police attending the sentencing shouted their complaints,
calling out ``Corrupt!'' and ``Now you have your show trial!,'' ADN
said.
   The policeman was found guilty of causing bodily harm when he
pushed the man down stairs at a police station after taking him
into custody during a demonstration Oct. 7. The ruling said the act
was not deliberate, ADN said.
   Demonstrations in East Berlin and other cities led to the ouster
of hard-line Communist Party leader Erich Honecker.
   The agency said the defendant was 41 and referred to him as a
``former policeman,'' indicating he was dismissed from the force.

<TEXT>
   The hard-line Communist Party
chief and ruling Politburo resigned Friday, forced from power by a
week of massive pro-democracy protests that surpassed even the
``Prague Spring'' of 1968.
   Milos Jakes became the third Soviet bloc leader to be swept out
of office in a stunning five-week wave of political upheaval that
has washed over the Communist world in Eastern Europe.
   The party Central Committee elected little-known Karel Urbanek,
member of the party's Politburo only since October 1988, to replace
Jakes who resigned along with the rest of the 13-man Politburo and
Secretariat.
   At the end of a 16-hour closed-door session that lasted until
early Saturday the Central Committee reshuffled the Politburo,
shrinking it to nine members. It elected Urbanek and five holdovers
along with three new men, Josef Cizek, Miroslav Huscava and
Miroslav Zajic.
   Premier Ladislav Adamec, who broke with years of policy this
week by meeting opposition activists, was among those Politburo
members who lost their seats, meaning a new premier will likely be
named soon.
   Thousands of people poured into Wenceslas Square Friday night,
dancing, singing and popping champagne corks at the news of the
resignations. The celebration _ one week after police clubbed
peaceful protesters _ capped a day in which 300,000 people jammed
the square for the triumphant return of Alexander Dubcek, the bold
reformer ousted in 1968.
   ``An old wise man said, `If there once was light, why should
there be darkness again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the
light back again,'' Dubcek had told the jubilant crowd.
   Later, when he heard the news of the resignations, Dubcek and
top dissidents at a news conference jumped to their feet, shouted
``Hooray!'' and hugged each other joyously.
   After the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in
August 1968 Dubcek was ousted from the Communist Party in disgrace.
   Zdenek Horeni, editor in chief of the party newspaper Rude
Pravo, held a news conference early Saturday after the Central
Committee meeting ended and he was asked about Dubcek's future.
   He said Dubcek ``was expelled because he completely failed as
party and state representative. I personally doubt that Alexander
Dubcek could possibly be readmitted to the Czechslovak party.''
   There was no immediate response to the resignations from student
and intellectual leaders who had called for a general strike on
Monday to force Jakes to step down.
   Urbanek, 48, is the former party leader of the Czech republic.
He was a surprise choice to replace Jakes and represented a break
with the rigid policies in place since the invasion. His selection,
on a vote of 136-7, seemed designed to boost the party's flagging
standing after a week of nationwide calls for its reform-resistant
leaders to resign.
   Jakes said the party had not instituted reforms quickly enough
and had underestimated the effect of the pro-democracy movement
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   In Washington, the State Department said it hoped Urbanek ``will
act swiftly to address the long-awaited desires of the
Czechoslovakian people for civil liberties, political freedom and
basic human rights.'' British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
also in Washington, said: ``We have great hopes that Czechoslovakia
will also become a democracy.''
   In a terse dispatch, the official news agency CTK announced:
   ``The general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,
Milos Jakes, and all other members of the Politburo and Secretariat
submitted their resignations so that a new leadership of the party
could be elected. Jakes said he hoped the newly elected organs of
the party will contribute to a more resolute implementation of the
process of restructuring and democratization.''
   Restructuring and democratization have been key terms used by
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has inspired the reforms
that have swept through his own nation, Poland, Hungary, East
Germany and Bulgaria.
   Czechoslovakia's leaders, who were installed after the Warsaw
Pact invasion, had resisted most of the reforms adopted by their
formerly hard-line Communist allies. Earlier this year, however,
they allowed thousands of East German refugees to pass through
Czechoslovakia on their way to West Germany.
   Since Nov. 17, hundreds of thousands of people have filled the
streets of Prague and other cities demanding democratic reforms and
the end of the Communists' monopoly on power. They have been the
largest demonstrations in the nation's history.
   ``For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere
accompanied by large demonstrations,'' CTK quoted Jakes as saying.
``The tension is gradually spreading to other places in the
republic. We must openly say that our country is at a fateful
crossroads.''
   ``We have underestimated completely the processes taking place
in Poland, Hungary and especially recently in East Germany and
their effect and influence on our society,'' said Jakes, who was
responsible for the expulsion from the party of half a million
Communists, including Dubcek.
   In December 1987, Jakes was named Communist Party chief to
succeed Gustav Husak, who came to power in April 1969, eight months
after the invasion. Jakes, 67, was seen as a bureaucrat and party
functionary whose speeches and personality have made little or no
public impact despite his long years in high office.
   Dubcek, 67, made his first public appearance in Prague since the
party purge in June 1970. Since his ouster, he has worked as a
low-level employee of the state forestry services and has lived in
virtual seclusion.
   ``Dubcek, Dubcek!'' and ``Long live Dubcek!'' the flag-waving
crowd yelled as he appeared in Wenceslas Square, the site of
repeated pro-democracy demonstrations. He urged them to unite to
improve the country.
   ``The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the
conditions of a new generation,'' Dubcek said. ``We must unify to
raise our country to a higher level.''
   Pro-democracy demonstrations also were held in the cities of
Bratislava, Brno, Kosice, Ostrava and Usti nad Labem, according to
state-run media.
   Dubcek threw his support behind the Civil Forum, an opposition
group formed Sunday to guide Czechoslovakia's pro-democracy
movement.
   He appealed to police, militia and the army ``to stand by the
people's side,'' and not to destroy the search for democracy.
   ``Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the
people,'' Dubcek said. He also told demonstrators to ``avoid
extremist trends.''
   Riot police beat hundreds of peaceful demonstrators in the
square on Nov. 17, sparking a week of growing protests. Police have
kept a generally low profile since then.
   Playwright Vaclav Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent
dissident, then spoke to the crowd and told them that Civic Forum
``is ready to negotiate with the authorities elsewhere than on the
streets.''
   ``But it's not up to us, but to them, whether democracy will
arise from the excited atmosphere on the square. It is their turn
to move, not ours,'' Havel said.

   A growing drug trade has led to
concern that the Philippines is in danger of becoming the Colombia
of the Far East. Calls are going out for tougher laws and the death
penalty for drug dealers.
   Police say the illegal drug trade has become a $41
million-a-year business in recent years. The three largest drug
syndicates employ about 15,000 people fulltime, according to police
estimates.
   The trade comes nowhere near that of Colombia's
multibillion-dollar drug cartels, but experts here say most of the
narcotics produced in the Philippines are used locally.
   But Filipino and foreign experts fear the country could become a
major regional drug center because of a favorable climate for
growing marijuana, corruption and inefficiency within the police
and established trade and communications links to the United States
and other markets.
   In October, U.S. agents in Los Angeles seized two tons of
Philippine-grown marijuana worth $14 million in what was believed
to be an attempt to establish a pipeline between Manila and
California.
   Two Americans of Filipino ancestry were arrested recently in
Honolulu for allegedly trying to smuggle in two pounds of the drug
crystal methamphetamine, a widely abused drug known in Southeast
Asia as ``shabu'' and said by officials and drug experts to be more
addictive than crack.
   Philippine-grown marijuana and other drugs also have turned up,
albeit in modest amounts, in Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan,
Pakistan, Turkey and some European countries, police say.
   Foreign and Filipino narcotics officials say syndicates have
been bringing in foreigners, mostly Europeans, to teach growers
here how to grow better quality marijuana.
   Last year, police uprooted 15 million marijuana plants and
seized 7.5 tons of marijuana packed for shipment abroad.
   ``If we do not do something about this, there might come a time
when we will see the spectacle of the Philippines becoming like
Colombia, where drug lords even have armies, helicopters, planes
and even tanks,'' Sen. Alberto Romulo said at a recent Philippine
Senate hearing.
   Public concern over the problem began to grow in October after
Sen. Ernesto Herrera charged that at least 17 police and military
members, including a brigadier general, were protecting drug lords.
   According to the police, the drug trade is flourishing because
of the potential for huge profits in a country where the annual per
capita income is only about $600.
   Marijuana can be bought in remote mountain plantations for 200
pesos ($9) a kilo (2.2 pounds) and sold in Manila for 10 times as
much.
   Shabu, the crystaline drug, can be purchased in Hong Kong for
about $2,270 a kilo and sold in Manila for the equivalent of
$45,450. Sources say some shabu also is being made locally.
   Corruption among police and customs officials is said to
compound the enforcement problem.
   Col. Virgilio David, chief of the national police Narcotics
Command, said his unit is riddled with corruption because poorly
paid policemen find it difficult to turn down bribes from drug
syndicates. He said at least 40 of his officers and men had been
removed in an attempt to combat corruption.
   David and others say stronger laws and greater police powers are
needed in the Philippines.
   ``In Hong Kong, if you go there and the police doubt your
papers, they can just detain you,'' David said. ``That is the same
case in Singapore and Malaysia. They have stronger laws that
empower the police to arrest anybody based only on strong suspicion
that they are a violators of the law. We must have the same kind of
laws here.''
   David said the military has urged Congress to revive the death
penalty for drug dealers. The Constitution, ratified in 1987,
abolished capital punishment but allows Congress to revive it for
``heinous'' crimes.
   He also said the government should establish special courts to
handle only drug offenses to speed up trials, which often drag on
here for years.
   Because of legal obstacles in enforcing the laws, critics say,
police often simply execute big-time dealers and then report that
they were killed in a ``shootout.''
   In the Manila area alone, at least 22 drug pushers have been
killed in ``shootouts'' with police since Herrera made his charges
about the police and military in October.
   Sen. Neptali Gonzalez, a former justice secretary, said the
killings should persuade drug dealers to turn themselves in and
seek government protection.
   ``Otherwise, they may soon find themselves targets of
elimination,'' he said.

   General Motors is trying to stuff a bigger air
conditioner into its cars, while American Telephone &amp; Telegraph is
revising decades-old assembly line practices.
   The changes come as industry, under pressure from government and
environmentalists, seeks to eliminate the use of
chlorofluorocarbons, the one-time wonder chemical that has been
destroying the Earth's ozone layer.
   But the task is more complicated than simply replacing an old
chemical with a new one, government and industry experts say.
   ``The transition is going to take time ... We're talking about
retrofitting not one industry, but several industries,'' says F.A.
``Tony'' Vogelsberg, environmental manager for the Freon Division
at Du Pont, a major producers of CFCs.
   CFCs, discovered in 1928, help cool houses in the summer and
keep them warm in the winter. They are used to make the foam
cushions on couches, in pillows _ even in stuffed toys.
   Without them, refrigerators would not cool as well; radios,
televisions, stereos or home computers might not work as well, and
items from coaxial cables to mailed Christmas gifts might not have
as much packaging protection.
   But CFCs also have a dark side: When they float 10 to 30 miles
above the Earth to the stratosphere, their chlorine component eats
away at the ozone shield that protects against the sun's
cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.
   Industrial nations want to ban all CFC production within the
next decade. But while a half-dozen or more replacements are under
study, they all have some drawbacks and no single substitute is
expected to be found.
   ``I don't think there's going to be a substitute that is going
to be given an A-plus on all (areas of concern),'' said Eileen
Claussen, director of atmospheric and indoor air programs at the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``We're going to have to make some
tradeoffs.''
   The EPA is examining the array of substitutes, mainly a family
of chemicals called HCFCs, to determine whether they are toxic or
pose other health concerns and how significantly they harm the
environment. The HCFCs also deplete ozone but much less severely.
   ``We clearly do not want to blunder along and create a new
health or environmental problem while solving the ones that we
targeted,'' said Charles Elkins, whose EPA office is reviewing the
potential toxicity of some CFC substitutes.
   Every year more than 2 billion pounds of CFCs are produced
worldwide, a third of them in the United States.
   The United States banned use of the chemical in aerosol cans in
1978, four years after the first concerns about the ozone layer
were raised. Still, the operation of more than $135 billion worth
of equipment nationwide is dependent on CFCs.
   Industry turned to CFCs because they do not burn or corrode
metal, pose no direct health hazards to workers and hold heat and
cold, making them ideal insulators.
   That was before their threat to the ozone layer was understood.
   Half of the ozone over Antarctica was destroyed during September
and October 1987, causing a hole in the Earth's protective shield
that closes and reappears with the seasons. Severe destruction of
the ozone layer is believed to be occurring over the South Pole
again this year, according to scientists. They say the conditions
for ozone destruction are present over the Arctic, although no
massive loss of ozone has been observed there.
   Several large corporations have announced plans to end their
reliance on CFCs, some by the early 1990s. These include such
giants as AT&amp;T, IBM, Boeing and General Electric.
   ``We have used CFC solvents and cleaners for so long they're
almost ingrained in the manufacturing process,'' says David
Chittick, vice president for environment and safety at AT&amp;T.
Nevertheless, AT&amp;T hopes to end all uses of CFCs by 1994.
   The major automakers are developing substitutes and are
designing new air conditioning units to accommodate the changeover,
probably in the mid-1990s.
   But the new air conditioners will be less energy efficient and
require larger compressors, experts say. ``We feel we can do it
without any dramatic effects on the look or design of the car. It's
going to be difficult though,'' says Toni Simonetti, a GM
spokeswoman.
   Congress is considering legislation calling for the elimination
of CFCs by the year 2000 and at least 20 states are reviewing
proposals aimed at curbing CFC pollution. Vermont has banned the
use of CFCs in auto air conditioners after 1994.
   Du Pont has spent more than $100 million on research for CFC
substitutes and estimates it will spend as much as $1 billion to
build production plants and to cover other costs during a 10-year
transition period. ICI Americas, another major manufacturer, also
has spent $100 million in CFC replacement research and recently
announced plans to begin production of a substitute cooling agent
by 1992 at a new Louisiana plant.
   But developing substitute chemicals will not be enough.
   As much as 30 percent of today's CFC demand will have to be
eliminated by conservation and recycling, government and industry
experts say. Major appliance manufacturers as well as automakers
recently have supplied their repair shops with equipment to capture
CFCs rather than let the old coolant vent into the air.
   But EPA and industry officials acknowledge that routine venting
of old CFCs is still widespread.
   Shifts to new manufacturing procedures or altogether new
technology could account for a 30 percent reduction in CFC demand,
especially in the electronics industry, the experts say.
   But some critics say that industry is slow to accept new
technology. ``What we're facing is inertia,'' says Marc Goldberg of
Crynodynamics, a New Jersey-based company that is producing a
refrigeration system using helium as a cooling agent. The system is
being marketed primarily for commercial uses. The major automakers
have expressed little interest.
   Companies such as AT&amp;T and Northern Telecom are turning to new
manufacturing procedures such as using low-solid fluxes to reduce
leftover residues and eliminate the need for CFCs as a solvent for
cleaning circuit boards after soldering.
   ``This (CFC problem) has caused a whole new review of the way we
do business,'' says A.D. Fitzgerald, director of environmental
affairs at Northern Telecom, a Canadian-based manufacturer of
telephone equipment.
   The thorniest problems have emerged in the area of refrigeration
and air conditioning because all substitutes under consideration
pose energy and environmental tradeoffs, particularly in the area
of global warming.
   A bill putting a time limit on use of HCFCs as substitutes for
chlorofluorocarbons has been approved by a Senate environmental
subcommittee, but its prospects in Congress are uncertain.
   Environmentalists say, meanwhile, that even the less potent
HCFCs would be a dangerous threat to ozone depletion if the amount
used worldwide is dramatically increased over the next century.
   The HCFC family of substitutes should be looked at only as a
``bridge'' solution and industry should not be allowed to ``sit
back and be happy once they made the one-step transition,'' says
David Doniger, an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council.

<TEXT>
   Arriving at work one recent
morning, Adolfo Perez Esquivel, winner of the 1980 Nobel Peace
Prize, found his office had been vandalized.
   An interior door was smashed open, and thieves took a computer,
files and typewriters from his workplace in a dilapidated building
in a run-down neighborhood.
   ``They weren't common criminals, but ... the forces of national
insecurity,'' the human rights advocate said in an interview.
``They stole everything and the police did absolutely nothing.''
   Perez Esquivel, 59, recounted the incident matter-of-factly,
convinced the break-in stemmed from his vocal opposition to an Oct.
7 presidential pardon of soldiers accused of human rights abuses,
and his efforts to call attention to society's downtrodden.
   ``The Nobel Prize opened a lot of doors and possibilities,
except in my own country, where ... an effort continues to
permanently silence our work,'' he said.
   The mild mannered, slightly built son of a Spanish fisherman
taught architecture at the University of La Plata until he became
enmeshed in human rights causes during Argentina's turbulent 1970s.
   While leftists with guns and bombs tried to bring down the
elected government of President Isabel Peron and the military
regime that succeeded it, Perez Esquivel preached social change
through non-violence.
   In 1973, he founded the Peace and Justice Service, which has
branches in 11 Latin American countries. Two years later, he helped
set up the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights.
   Both organizations protested the arrests and presumed killings
of thousands of alleged leftists who ``disappeared'' during the
1976-83 dictatorship.
   Despite the work of his organizations and his detention without
charges for 15 months in 1977 and 1978, Perez Esquivel was little
known even in Argentina when the Nobel Committee announced his name
in October 1980.
   Since then, Perez Esquivel has achieved a certain international
stature, although nothing like that of other Nobel laureates such
as Mother Teresa, Andrei Sakharov, Lech Walesa or Archbishop
Desmond Tutu.
   These days, Perez Esquivel puts together proposals to raise
funds from churches and agencies in the United States and Europe,
travels and writes.
   He and a small staff, mostly volunteers, help poor people get
legal title to land on which they work or live, set up shelters for
abandoned children, organize soup kitchens and clothing drives for
the needy.
   Most any rally in support of democracy, civil rights or social
welfare can count on his presence, his signature on petitions, his
voice.
   ``He genuinely feels his ideals,'' said the director of the
human rights group Legal and Social Studies Center, Emilio Mignone,
a friend for 15 years. ``He is a very simple man ... ethical,
generous.''
   Perez Esquivel also can be disorganized and quixotic, however,
and that, colleagues say, has hampered his effectiveness.
   His Peace and Justice Service is neither the biggest nor most
prestigious human rights group in Argentina.
   Leaders of other groups _ who also protested, at personal risk,
the atrocities of the ``dirty war'' against leftist subversion _
hoped Perez Esquivel's distinction would make it easier to
influence popular opinion and public policy.
   That has not happened. The government treats Perez Esquivel as a
gadfly, and his Peace and Justice Service lacks the staff and the
clout to deliver people to rallies or push an idea in the public
consciousness.
   ``He's more important internationally'' than in Argentina, said
Hebe de Bonafini, a founder another human rights group, the Mothers
of the Plaza de Mayo. ``I think he could have done more things. ...
Before, he had more impact than now.''
   Perez Esquivel's politics are openly left of center. Companies
and natural resources should be kept in state hands even if they
lose money or the government has no ability to exploit them, he
says, criticizing plans to privatize them.
   The foreign debt is unpayable, he says, workers should receive
higher salaries, businesses should be compelled to be more
productive, the government should insist that capital flight cease,
weapons manufacturers should be convinced to make non-lethal
products.
   And the servicemen who committed human rights abuses should be
tried by elected President Carlos Menem's government, he says,
despite open resistence from sectors of the armed forces.
   Despite the seriousness of his causes, his maintains a cheerful
disposition and says he bears no hatred to those who imprisoned him
or threatened him, his wife or his three children.
   ``I'm optimistic by nature,'' he said. ``I try to contribute, to
make things a little better. ... I hope my life has been useful.''

<DATELINE>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An assistant principal who got fed up
with his students' sloppy habits tried to teach them a lesson in
table manners by taking away the cafeteria tables.
   Teens in two of the three lunch periods at Erwin High School ate
on the floor Wednesday after Assistant Principal Robin Thomas
ordered the tables taken down.
   ``What we did today we did to get their attention,'' Thomas
said. ``I hope we got it.''
   Thomas said school administrators had warned students for two
weeks to clean up after themselves or risk losing their tables.
   ``The problem has been that we've had some pigs eating in the
cafeteria _ at least you might call them that from the look of the
place after they finish,'' Thomas said.
   But some students and their parents found the tactic severe.
   ``The floor is something people walk on, not eat on. It's
nasty,'' said Mandy DeWitt, a junior who left school rather than
dine on the linoleum. ``They are punishing all of us for the
actions of a few and that's not right.''
   Her mother, Brenda DeWitt, said Thomas punished a ``lot of kids
who did nothing wrong and I think, they forgot they were dealing
with children, not prisoners in a war camp.''
   Thomas responded: ``The students were not kept from eating. What
we were trying to teach them is that there are consequences for
their actions.''
   Tracey Christopher, another junior who left school at lunchtime,
said the action was ill-timed as well as unfair, because she and
other students had donated blood that day.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is conducting one of
the largest aid programs in its history to support the government
in Kabul, transporting billions of dollars in weapons, food and
fuel to the war-torn nation.
   Beginning at least one year before the Red Army withdrew in
February 1989, the operation has brought hundreds of thousands of
tons of commodities to Afghanistan, the state-run press has
reported.
   Another $3 billion in military aid, including advanced weapons,
is supplied annually, Eastern European diplomats said.
   The United States gives the anti-government guerrillas an
estimated $500 million worth of arms a year.
   ``If we didn't have food from the Soviet Union, we would
starve,'' says Massuma Esmaty Wardak, president of the Afghanistan
Women's Council. ``We have no one else to turn to.''
   The massive operation indicates the commitment Moscow has made
to the Kabul government, which came to power in a bloody Communist
coup in 1978. Soviet troops arrived the following year to prop up
the faltering Marxist regime.
   After the Red Army ended its decade-long military intervention
in February, Western diplomats predicted a quick victory for the
guerrillas. But Kabul didn't fall.
   The rebels failed to unite, and Soviet aid gave the government
the firepower and food it needed.
   ``The West underestimated the Soviet commitment. Everyone
thought the Red Army was retreating and had lost the war,'' said
one diplomat, who has been counting transport planes and trucks for
the past nine months. ``Only now do we know how serious the
Russians really were.''
   For their aid, the Soviets get a pliant government on its
southern border that helps offset neighboring Iran's Islamic
fundamentalism and Pakistan's pro-Americanism.
   In late October, the Daily Payam, official organ of the ruling
People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, published an unusually
detailed account of Soviet aid.
   From February to August, it said, 266,543 metric tons of Soviet
goods crossed through the border town of Hayratan.
   Among the goods, more than 40,000 tons of fuel, 82,000 tons of
wheat, 1,000 tons of cooking oil, 900 tons of sugar and 540 tons of
flour rolled into Afghanistan on more than 21,000 Soviet trucks,
the newspaper said.
   The United Nations says another 220,000 tons of Soviet-supplied
flour, some of it purchased from the United States and Australia,
is in the pipeline.
   Also since February, 168,750 tons of goods have arrived in Kabul
aboard 6,750 Soviet transport planes, diplomats said.
   Diplomats estimated that until recently the airlift contained 75
percent weapons and 25 percent food. But Afghan officials
reportedly have asked that the food portion be raised to 40 percent
in view of the coming winter and the country's serious
transportation problems, caused by war, bad roads and harsh weather.
   To help with this problem, the Soviets recently gave Kabul 2,200
heavy duty trucks, the state-run Bakhtar news agency reported last
month. Tens of thousands of vehicles had already been left behind
by the Red Army when it pulled out.
   Diplomats said the duration and size of the operation make it
one of the biggest aid programs in Soviet history, rivaled only by
Soviet aid to Cuba and Vietnam.
   ``The costs are tremendous and we believe that not even Moscow
knows how much it is paying,'' said one high-ranking Asian diplomat
whose country is friendly with both Moscow and Kabul.
   In the military sphere, diplomats in Kabul and Islamabad say
that since 1988, about $200 million to $300 million in weapons have
been crossing the Soviet border each month.
   Diplomats from two Eastern European countries who provided the
$3 billion annual estimate said Moscow has promised to provide
Afghanistan with two advanced weapons: the Scud-500, an updated
version of the medium-range missiles already supplied to Kabul, and
the MiG-29, an advanced combat jet. The Soviets already have given
Afghanistan more than 150 planes for its air force, mostly MiG-21
fighters.
   Afghanistan also has received air defense rockets, according to
the April 29 edition of the state-run Kabul Times, which carried a
photograph of the weapons on its front page.
   Some diplomats challenged attempts to estimate the value of
Soviet military aid because accounting methods vary from country to
country.
   Diplomats in Kabul and Pakistan say Afghanistan has fired 1,000
Scud missiles in the past year at the rebels. Each rocket costs
about $1 million on the arms market, bringing the Scuds' total cost
to $1 billion.
   But they contend the missiles are valueless because Moscow
probably would have destroyed the weapons, which were orginally
built to carry nuclear warheads and use 1960s technology.
   In addition to aid, the Soviet Union occupies a commanding
position in Afghanistan's economy.
   Soviet economic ties account for 60 percent of Afghanistan's
state budget and 75 percent of its industrial output, the Daily
Payam said in November.
   Soviet assistance is used in the production of 100 percent of
Afghanistan's natural gas, 100 percent of its chemical fertilizer
and 60 percent of its electricity, the Payam said.
   Since the 1954 signing of the first Afghan-Soviet long term
credit agreement, Moscow has had close economic ties with Kabul.
Soviet aid built housing, roads and bridges, and generated power.
In 1956, the two nations signed an agreement for the training and
modernization of Afghanistan's armed forces. The military led the
Communist revolution in 1978.
   Since the Soviet intervention, Afghanistan has become
increasingly isolated economically.
   The U.S.-backed rebels have cut the road to Pakistan, which
carried flour and cooking oil. Trade with Iran is minimal. Among
the industrialized nations only Japan, which exports about $100
million a year, has substantial economic ties.

   ``I am numb from all those years of waiting, waiting
in vain,'' says Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky. But the wait is
nearly over.
   Few perhaps have more riding on Pope John Paul II's meeting Dec.
1 with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev than Lubachivsky, head of
the Ukrainian Catholic Church.
   The historic encounter holds out the prospect that the Ukrainian
church will be legalized after 43 years of suppression, and
Lubachivsky will be able to return to his homeland for the first
time in 51 years.
   ``We're optimistic about it, yes,'' the 75-year-old former
metropolitan-archbishop of Philadelphia said in an interview. ``But
to have too much hope, too much trust is not good. There is a
Polish proverb: `Hope is mother of the stupid people.' So it's
better just to be practical and wait to see what happens.''
   Still, Lubachivsky sees concrete signs the pope's talks with
Gorbachev will pave the way for legalization of the Ukrainian
church in the next two months.
   He said information coming from the Soviet Union indicates the
government has already approved the basis of a new law on religion,
which would give all churches the same legal status under the
Constitution.
   ``We expect this will become law around the middle or end of
January,'' Lubachivsky said.
   He says Soviet authorities have adopted a much more tolerant
attitude toward the Ukrainian Catholics in the past few months,
allowing them to celebrate Mass in public, import Bibles and
communicate by fax with church groups in the West.
   It is in Gorbachev's interests to legalize the church of more
than 4 million followers in the Soviet Union's second largest
republic, the cardinal said.
   ``If Mr. Gorbachev would like to have the moral support of the
Holy Father, this is the condition that he could get it,''
Lubachivsky said. ``He needs this. He'll also have the support from
the Western countries. He needs the money from the West.''
   Legalizing the Ukrainian church could also lead to the first
papal visit to the Soviet Union. John Paul frequently has expressed
the wish to travel to the Ukraine and Lithuania.
   ``We would invite him as soon as we are free,'' Lubachivsky
said. ``I think he would not refuse.''
   Lubachivsky credits the Polish-born pope, a fellow Slav, for
helping bring the Ukrainian church out of the catacombs and to the
brink of legalization.
   ``He is the greatest friend of ours and he has always assured me
he would be staying fast for the legalization of our church,'' he
said.
   Ukrainian Catholics practice the Byzantine, or Eastern, rite but
look to Rome for guidance and recognize the authority of the pope.
   The Ukrainian church, which traces its history to the
introduction of Christianity in the region 1,000 years ago, was
suppressed in 1946 by Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. It was forcibly
merged with the Russian Orthodox Church and its clergy were
arrested, deported or shot.
   The church continued to flourish underground, however, with
priests and bishops ordained and consecrated in secret. Encouraged
by Gorbachev's glasnost policies, church officials and faithful
have come out in the open in the past two years to demand official
recognition.
   Church officials in the West estimate there are 12 Catholic
bishops, 1,000 priests and 1,200 monks and nuns in the Ukraine.
   Lubachivsky was born in Dolyna, Western Ukraine, in 1914. He
left in 1937 when the Ukraine was under Polish occupation to study
in Austria, Switzerland and Italy. He moved to the United States in
1947 and became an American citizen.
   The pope appointed Lubachivsky as metropolitan-archbishop of
Philadelphia in 1979 and made him cardinal six years later. He
replaced Cardinal Josyf Slipyj, who died in 1984, as leader of
Ukrainian Catholics.
   If the church is legalized, Lubachivsky said, he would return to
the Ukraine if permitted by Soviet authorities and organize the
hierarchy.
   ``I would like to see how the country looks because for 50 years
I haven't seen anything,'' he said. ``I would like to see for
myself how the people are living. Most of my family has died, but I
would like to see if there are any relatives left.''
   A major stumbling block to legalization has been the opposition
of the Russian Orthodox Church, which stands to lose some 450
churches it took over from the Catholics after 1946.
   ``Up until now the people were worshiping in forests, in the
streets, in private houses,'' Lubachivsky said. ``That's not the
way to worship God.''
   Vatican officials have held periodic negotiations with the
Russian Orthodox Church, but Lubachivsky contends only the Soviet
government can resolve the dispute by giving the churches back.

   The assassination of President Rene
Mouawad leaves Lebanon staring into the abyss, as it has so often
since a seemingly endless civil war began 14 years ago.
   Mouawad was trying to assemble a government that could end the
war. His death Wednesday, after only 17 days as president, raised
the possibility of more fighting between the 40,000 Syrian soldiers
in Lebanon and Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian army commander.
   The assassination underlined the dangers of trying to achieve
peace in a deeply divided land that has become a proxy battleground
for rival powers in the Middle East.
   One clear motive for killing Mouawad was to undermine the peace
agreement reached by Lebanese legislators Oct. 24 in Taif, Saudi
Arabia, after weeks of negotiations mediated by the Arab League.
   Many earlier attempts to end the war, which has cost more than
150,000 lives since 1975, have been wrecked by one or more of the
many factions involved.
   Amin Gemayel, who was Lebanon's last president and left office
last fall, scuttled a Syrian-arranged peace treaty signed in
December 1985 by leaders of the main Moslem and Christian militias.
He contended it stripped Maronite Catholics of the power they have
held since independence from France in 1943.
   Mouawad also was a Maronite, the main Christian sect in Lebanon,
as Lebanese presidents traditionally have been.
   If supporters of the Taif accord hope to save it, they must move
swiftly to elect another president acceptable both to Syria, the
main power broker in Lebanon, and the Moslem and Christian factions.
   More than a score of people were killed with Mouawad, an
advocate of reconciliation, when a remote-controlled bomb
containing an estimated 550 pounds of explosives went off in a
crowded street as his motorcade passed.
   There was no claim of responsibility, but the murky world of
Lebanese and Middle East politics contains no shortage of suspects.
   Syria, which supports the Taif accord, quickly pointed the
finger at Aoun, the main Christian opponent of the plan.
   President Hafez Assad of Syria clearly referred to the general
when he called the assassination ``a new impulse to double the
support for Lebanon so that it can destroy the evil in its nest and
in order for the Lebanese to avenge themselves against those ...
who wanted with their crime to hit Lebanon's unity and prolong the
suffering of the Lebanese.''
   Assad did not elaborate, but his remarks indicated Syria might
use the slaying to justify a move against Aoun.
   Israel's chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said in Tel Aviv
the Syrians probably would attack Aoun, who commands about 20,000
men in Christian units of the Lebanese army.
   Yossi Olmert, an Israeli government official, said: ``The losers
are the Syrians, and those who gained are all those who think that
an elected president in Lebanon would be bad for their interests.''
   An Arab analyst said privately the gainers include Syria and
Israel.
   ``A unified Lebanese government would be able to ask the Syrians
to leave, which the Syrians don't want to do,'' he said. ``If the
Syrians went, then the Israelis would have to get out of the border
enclave they occupy in south Lebanon.''
   Aoun has said the Taif agreement is a betrayal because it does
not provide for speedy withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian soldiers,
who are in Lebanon under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate issued
in 1976.
   He fought an artillery ``war of liberation'' against the Syrians
that lasted six months until the Arab League arranged a truce Sept.
22. More than 900 people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded, most
of them civilians.
   The fundamentalist Shiite Moslem militia Hezbollah, and its
Iranian sponsors, also oppose the peace accord. Hezbollah says it
ignores the demands of the 1.2 million Shiites, the largest sect in
Lebanon, for more political power.
   Druse Moslem chief Walid Jumblatt has gone along with the
agreement, albeit grudgingly, to please his Syrian allies, but has
made clear he does not feel it goes far enough in curbing Maronite
privilege.
   Some Lebanese see the hand of Iraq, Syria's archrival in the
Arab world and Aoun's main supporter, in the assassination of
Mouawad. President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, a sworn enemy of Assad,
went along with the Taif accord only after Saudi Arabia threatened
to cut off aid.

   Japan's judicial set-up may appear similar to
systems in the West, but in Japan strip searches are routine,
lengthy delays occur in setting bail, and the odds of being found
innocent are 1-in-15,000, an expert says.
   ``There are many peculiar traditions,'' said Hiroshi Itakura,
professor of criminal law at Nippon University.
   The traditions and customs, which play a strong role at all
levels of Japanese society, may pose other hurdles for the 12
politicians, bureaucrats or business executives charged with
bribery in the influence-peddling scandal known as the Recruit
affair. The first of five separate trials begins Friday.
   ``The Japanese judiciary system may look similar to that of
ordinary Western democratic countries on the surface, but it
differs a great deal in substance,'' Itakura said.
   In a typical criminal case, suspects are required to undergo a
physical examination completely naked at the beginning of police
investigation following arrest.
   Police can question suspects for up to 48 hours before sending
them to prosecutors, who have 20 days to interrogate them before
filing formal charges with the court. The suspect is permitted to
have a lawyer present during interrogation.
   An arrested person has no chance of being released on bail until
prosecutors complete their investigation.
   Hiromasa Ezoe, the central figure in the Recruit bribery case,
was arrested Feb. 13 and held until June 6, when he was released on
$1.4 million bail. He was charged with seven counts of bribery of
politicians and public officials.
   Defendants do not enter a formal plea until their trials start,
and there is no plea bargaining beforehand. There is no chance to
sway a jury _ trials are decided by a single judge at the district
court level _ and judges hardly ever give innocent verdicts.
   ``The chance that the court will find a suspect innocent is only
one out of 15,000,'' said Itakura. ``I think it reflects a
homogeneous society where judges, prosecutors and defense attorneys
all share a similar sense of justice and fairness.''
   If Ezoe's trial goes by the usual pattern in Japan, his 18
defense lawyers will try to draw the case out and reduce the
penalty after the virtually inevitable guilty verdict.
   Since there is no plea bargaining, a defendant may want to plead
innocent, but a judge may take that as a sign of a lack of
repentance and impose a stiffer sentence.
   ``Once you are arrested for wrongdoing, it is hard to expect
fairness of the Western standard in this country,'' said Itakura.
``I guess it depends on how you define fairness, but in general,
the Japanese judiciary system is made in such a way that tends to
be quite cruel to criminals.''

   A retiree who borrowed $20 from his ex-wife to
play a slot machine in the city's newest resort won a $4.6 million
jackpot.
   Elmer Sherwin, 76, of Las Vegas, hedged when a reporter asked
him during a Thanksgiving Day news conference if his newfound
fortune would reunite the couple.
   ``She won't have me,'' Sherwin said.
   ``He said that, not me,'' piped up his ex-wife, Florence, who
said the two are ``still buddies'' 13 years after divorce ended
their 25-year marriage.
   Sherwin spent 90 minutes playing $80 of his own money Wednesday
night at the new Mirage hotel-casino on the Las Vegas strip. Then,
nine hours after the casino opened and shortly after borrowing the
money, he hit the winner.
   The jackpot _ on the Megabucks system linking slot machins in
dozens of casinos _ was the largest payoff in Las Vegas history but
didn't surpass the Nevada record of $6.8 million won in Reno.
   ``Then I started taking Tums and I've been taking them ever
since,'' he said.
   Florence Sherwin said she wasn't surprised when her ex-husband
put the touch on her for $20.
   ``He has a habit of not carrying enough money,'' she said.
   Sherwin, a former engineer from Cleveland who moved to Las Vegas
two years ago after touring the country in a mobile home, said he
planned to give some of the winnings to a son and others.
   And the former Mrs. Sherwin?
   ``Of course,'' he responded. ``I told her I would fix her up.''

   For former Secretary of State William Rogers,
the reunification of West and East Germany will be a reality when
the long-divided German nation fields a single Olympic athletic
team.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger thinks
reunification will come much sooner, perhaps within five years.
   Former Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who marvels at the changes
being wrought in Eastern Europe, believes it is far too early to
even discuss reunification and that doing so before events sort
themselves out is ``folly.''
   All three men had long experience sitting across the table from
tough Soviet leaders in grimmer times when the Cold War was truly
cold and the Iron Curtain truly iron.
   All three have varying ideas about the events transforming
Eastern Europe now.
   Rusk, who was secretary of state in the Kennedy administration
when the Berlin Wall was built, said in an interview that any
discussion of reunification is decidedly premature.
   ``I never thought I would live to see the day these things would
happen in Eastern Europe,'' Rusk said, speaking of the reform
program of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the rise of
democratic movements in Poland and Hungary, the opening of the
Berlin Wall, and unprecedented protest demonstrations in
Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria.
   ``These are dramatic and important changes,'' Rusk said. ``It's
too soon to tell if they are permanent. But I'm inclined to think
Gorbachev and the other leaders have set in motion forces that are
irresistible.''
   Rusk noted that 20 Soviet divisions remain in East Germany with
others in Poland.
   ``If Gorbachev were to be replaced we could return to the Cold
War rather quickly,'' Rusk said.
   In light of the uncertainties, he said, ``I deplore the
premature discussion of German reunification. In a situation moving
so fast, it's folly to do that.''
   Kissinger believes German reunification is ``unavoidable.''
   ``I don't believe that unification is decades away,'' Kissinger
told ABC News on Sunday. ``I really believe it will happen within
the next decade, and maybe even within the next five years.''
   But Rogers disagrees, saying, ``whatever develops will develop
more slowly than people think.''
   ``I'd like to make a wager on when Germany will have just one
team in the Olympic Games,'' he said in an interview, noting the
rivalry that has existed between the two Germanys in the past.
   During the 40 years in which the two Germanys have existed side
by side, united by a common tongue and culture, divided by ideology
and walls, ``a lot of nationalism has developed,'' Rogers said.
   The East Germans, he said, are relatively well and inexpensively
housed, and have a reasonable chance at a good education.
   ``I think there will be cooperative ventures between East and
West Germany,'' Rogers said. ``But as to reunification, I'd be
surprised if there was a single German team before two (four-year)
Olympic cycles are gone through. That would be an indication that
reunification had been completed.''
   Rusk and Rogers reject complaints by congressional Democrats
that when it comes to exploiting the opportunities presented by the
rush of events in Eastern Europe, President Bush is ``overly
timid.''
   ``My view is that we are doing the right thing,'' Rogers said,
``Because events and developments are changing so rapidly it makes
no sense to announce a hard and firm policy until we see the
results and know where things are going.
   ``I think it's unwise for the government to make strong
statements of policy now,'' he said. ``Being very aggressive in
foreign policy is often just a formula for spending more money.''
   Rusk appeared to agree with that.
   ``I'm inclined to think this is a pretty good time for the
Congress to remain silent,'' he said. ``I realize they find that
difficult. But they also find it difficult to be subtle and
sophisticated and tend to see things in black and white.''
   Rogers was asked if he had any advice for Bush as his December
summit with Gorbachev approaches.
   ``Keep on doing what he's doing,'' Rogers replied. ``I think
he's doing great.''

   Jean Robocker has some real turkeys for
neighbors, but things could be worse.
   They occasionally drop by for snacks and sit in her trees, but
they go to bed early and don't make much noise. In fact, they've
been so nice that she's decided she won't eat them.
   These turkeys are a flock of wild ones _ a flock that's grown to
about 1,000 birds foraging along the banks of the Flathead River
near Bigfork.
   The birds troop through her yard, pausing to peck at grain she
throws to them.
   But they're still wild turkeys. They don't respond to calls, and
if they aren't hungry, they won't show up for dinner, she says.
   ``They are not dumb like people think, and that's the reason
they have survived well,'' she says.
   Robocker is familiar with the birds' likes and dislikes, but
visitors seem to scare the birds away. Robocker says she maintains
the neighborly relationship with the turkeys by using a point of
animal etiquette she learned from the deer that also frequent her
yard.
   She never looks the animals in the eye.

<HEAD>U.S. May Put Anti-Drug Flotilla Off Colombia's Coast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon says Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney is considering a Navy proposal to aid the anti-drug war by
posting a flotilla off Colombia's coast.
   The proposal is among a range of ideas outlined by the heads of
the various military branches, but Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams
said Thursday no decisions have been made on whether to accept any
of them.
   In September, Cheney had asked the military leaders for ideas on
how to take a more active role in the international drug battle.
   The Los Angeles Times, citing anonymous sources, reported
Thursday that Cheney was ``pretty positive'' toward a Navy proposal
to put an aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task
force off the Colombian coast. ``It's a done deal,'' according to
one administration official quoted by the newspaper.
   But Williams, when asked about the report, said, ``It's not a
done deal.''
   Cheney this fall asked the military leaders to keep working on
their proposals because of legal questions and issues of
coordination among the different service branches, Williams said.
   An administration official, who was asked about the scope of the
flotilla proposal as outlined by the Times, said the report was
``not out of the realm of the things the Navy has proposed.''
   This official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Cheney
has been busy preparing the Pentagon's five-year budget plan and
has not concentrated in recent weeks on the various services'
anti-drug proposals.
   Williams said it is not clear yet when the administration will
formally announce the specific steps the Pentagon plans to take in
support of a broad, government-wide anti-drug effort.
   Under the plan reported in the Times, the Navy would operate an
aircraft carrier battle group or a marine amphibious task force off
Colombia. Each group would be in position for one or two months,
similar to training deployments.
   It was unclear whether the aircraft, their carriers or assigned
amphibious assault ships would be allowed to chase suspected drug
traffickers into Colombian territory.
   It also was unclear whether one or both Colombian coasts would
be involved. The country has two coasts, one on the Pacific Ocean
and one on the Caribbean Sea, with the Isthmus of Panama between
them.

   President Bush's Thanksgiving at the Camp
David retreat included a traditional dinner as well as several
games of horseshoes, the White House says.
   Bush won two matches pitching horseshoes, defeating one of his
guests, Willard Heminway, two games out of three, and then
defeating two of his staff by the same score, said spokesman Jay
Allison.
   Dinner, served early Thursday afternoon, included roast turkey
with stuffing and cranberry sauce, sweet potatoes topped with
marshmallows, green beans, salad and pumpkin and pecan pies.

   This week's accident that left two Marines
presumed killed in the western Mediterranean was the latest in a
string that prompted the Navy to order an unprecedented two-day
stand-down to review safety procedures earlier this month.
   The two Marines believed killed during exercises from the
helicopter carrier USS Iwo Jima were the 12th and 13th fatalities
in the series.
   This fall's string of accidents began with another on board the
Iwo Jima six weeks ago.
   Here is a rundown of the Navy's known accidents since then:
   _Oct. 11, an officer aboard the Iwo Jima was killed and a
crewman injured when struck by shrapnel from a shell fired by the
neighboring cargo ship El Paso during an exercise in the Atlantic.
   _Oct. 11, a sailor was lost overboard from the frigate USS
Downes 300 miles off Tokyo.
   _Oct. 29, a jet fighter pilot making his first carrier landing
crashed on the deck of the training aircraft carrier USS Lexington
in the Gulf of Mexico, killing himself and four others.
   _Oct. 30, the pilot of an F-A-18 attack jet accidentally dropped
a 500-pound bomb on the cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean,
slightly injuring five sailors.
   _Oct. 30, a sailor from the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson was
lost overboard in the Pacific 620 miles north of Wake Island.
   _Nov. 1, three sailors and $4 million worth of aircraft missiles
were swept overboard from the carrier USS Eisenhower off North
Carolina; two were rescued and one sailor was declared dead.
   _Nov. 1, nine sailors were injured in a boiler fire aboard the
USS Monongahela 500 miles west of Gibraltar.
   _Nov. 9, a Navy Reserve pilot flying an A-7E attack jet crashed
into an apartment complex in Smyrna, Ga., killing two civilians and
wounding two other people, including himself.
   _Nov. 11, one man was killed when the destroyer USS Kinkaid
collided with a freighter off the coast of Malaysia.
   _Nov. 14, an F-14 crashed into the Gulf of Mexico 60 miles
northwest of Key West. The two-man crew was not seriously injured.
   _Nov. 14, fire aboard the amphibious assault ship USS Inchon at
Norfolk, VA., injured 31 people, eight of them civilians.
   _Nov. 14, a technician at the Naval Surface Weapons Testing
Center in White Oak, Md., was slightly injured in a small lab
explosion.

   Kids give up Santa Claus more easily than their
parents, says one Santa who ought to know.
   For seven years, Carl Anderson has taken a break from his
counseling practice to play Santa. And this Kriss Kringle earned a
Ph.D. studying how children decide to stop believing in him.
   Wide-eyed children this week watched as Anderson, 36, inspected
the elaborate North Pole set at Dallas' NorthPark Center, where he
will spend the next month.
   Santa, he said, teaches children an early lesson about giving,
even though they are the recipients.
   But when it's time to give up the belief in a jolly old elf who
travels to every house in the world on one magic night, children
usually are ready, Anderson said.
   Children ``told us that more often they felt proud and happy and
good, basically because they felt more adultlike,'' said Anderson,
who in his research at the University of Texas three years ago
interviewed 75 9- to 12-year-olds and their parents.
   The parents react differently.
   ``They feel like their baby is growing up and it's all going by
too fast,'' he said.
   Children reported that, as early as age 5, they begin doubting
Santa Claus, Anderson said. By age 9, most have decided they don't
believe in him.
   ``Most kids reported at least going through two or three
Christmases of increasing doubt before they decided for themselves
to no longer believe,'' he said. ``So the first time they heard on
the schoolyard somebody say `Santa's not real,' it didn't
necessarily crush them at all.''
   The biggest surprise of his research, Anderson said, was that
children understood Santa as ``something that linked generations,
something that you go through initially as a child and participate
in one way and then later on you go through it again as a parent
from the other side.''
   Older children often adopt a parental role by professing to
believe in Santa to younger siblings, he said.
   Anderson said there is no single way for children to learn Santa
is a myth. He tells parents to try to find out what the child
believes.
   To children who declare Anderson is Santa, he gives a Santa
Claus business card, a response that keeps him from having to tell
a lie.
   ``Often they'll give you an indication of what they're looking
for,'' Anderson said. ``They may be looking for permission to
continue to believe. They may be wanting to say `Look, I'm old
enough now. Let's put the cards on the table and get straight with
this.'''

   Marine investigators are seeking the cause of
a helicopter crash that killed the craft's pilot and co-pilot this
week during carrier-based exercises in the Mediterranean Sea.
   The two crew members were declared dead Thursday following a
20-hour search by the Navy and Marine Corps, officials said.
   The AH-IT Cobra helicopter crashed and sank in the Mediterranean
during a night exercise. The search for the helicopter and its
pilot and co-pilot was called off at 10 a.m. EST Thursday, said
Capt. Elizabeth Kerstens, a Marine Corps spokeswoman.
   ``They had been searching for almost a day at that point and
decided there was no hope of finding them,'' Capt. Kerstens said.
``The pilots have been declared dead and their remains are
unrecovered.''
   The aircraft was operating from the helicopter carrier USS Iwo
Jima in the western Mediterranean off the coast of Spain when the
crash occurred at 2:21 p.m. EST Wednesday, according to the Marine
Corps.
   Capt. Kerstens said the cause of the crash was not immediately
known but that an investigation has been started.
   The pilot was identified as Capt. Todd O. Travis, 29, of
Glasgow, Ky.; and the co-pilot-gunner as Capt. Michael W. Vidusek,
28, of Naperville, Ill. Travis had been in the Marine Corps five
years and 10 months and Vidusek and been in the service six and
one-half years.
   The two officers were participating in a night carrier
qualification and instrument refresher training exercise when the
helicopter went down within sight of the ship, Capt. Kerstens said.
   She said Travis and Vidusek were not using night vision goggles
as a part of the exercise. Alleged defects in night vision goggles
and a high rate of military helicopter accidents involving their
use have prompted several recent congressional inquiries and
hearings.
   Capt. Kerstens said both pilots and the Iwo Jima had
participated in a 48-hour Navy ``safety stand-down'' two weeks ago,
during which almost all routine training was suspended for reviews
of safety procedures.
   The unprecedented stand-down was ordered following a string of
10 accidents in less than a month.
   The pilots were assigned to Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron
365, which is based at the Marine Corps Air Station at New River,
N.C., and is part of the 24th Marine Expedition Unit currently
deployed with the U.S. Sixth Fleet. The Iwo Jima is based at
Norfolk, Va.

   Discovery's astronauts set their
sights on a Sunday landing for a secret military space shuttle
mission that sources said included deployment of a spy satellite.
   Silence has surrounded most of the classified flight, but NASA
did interrupt the quiet briefly on Thanksgiving Day to announce
that the shuttle was scheduled to land at 7:02 p.m. PST Sunday at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform
satisfactorily,'' Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said in
the brief status report Thursday evening.
   According to sources close to the project, a 2{-ton, $300
million payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay early
Thursday morning about 10 hours into the flight.
   It was a satellite capable of monitoring Soviet missile tests
and eavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications in the
Soviet Union and other countries, said the sources, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The satellite was to be maneuvered into a stationary orbit
22,300 miles above the equator, on a line of sight to the Soviet
Union, China, the Middle East, Africa and all of Europe.
   The sources were unable to provide information on how the
satellite was operating. A similar satellite was launched by a
shuttle crew in 1985.
   They were expected to tend experiments for the ``Star Wars''
missile defense system and other military projects.
   The Defense Department has said the news blackout is necessary
to try to keep the Soviets from finding out about what the
astronauts are doing.
   Discovery is commanded by Air Force Col. Frederick D. Gregory.
His four-person crew: Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and the
three mission specialists, Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.
   The flight, the fifth dedicated to the military, began Wednesday
night with a spectacular nighttime liftoff that brightened the sky
over the central Florida coast. The launch time was dictated by the
secret cargo and its mission.
   On Thanksgiving Day, the astronauts dined on irradiated turkey,
freeze-dried vegetables and cranberry sauce.

<HEAD>Censorship During Rebel Offensive Was Dangerous, Journalists Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Salvador, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The government's crackdown on
the news media has kept Salvadorans in the dark about the most
dramatic fighting of the civil war and may even have cost some
lives, journalists and others say.
   On Nov. 12, the day after leftist rebels launched their biggest
offensive of the 10-year-old struggle, the rightist government of
President Alfredo Cristiani imposed a state of siege.
   The measure suspended rights guaranteed by the constitution,
including freedom of expression. Cristiani said Thursday the
suspension will last a month.
   Since it began, the population has been able to cull only vague
or mistaken perceptions of the battles.
   In the days after the offensive was launched, all radio and
television stations were forced to join the ``cadena nacional'' _
the national network. The programming of Radio Cuscatlan, the
military station, became the only source of broadcast information
and opinion.
   Early in the first week of fighting, the cadena dedicated
periodic segments to telephone callers, but it screened out
leftists.
   Several callers denounced the Jesuit priests who ran the Central
American University outside San Salvador. They called the priests
subversive ideologues and suggested they be expelled or otherwise
punished.
   On Nov. 16, they were indeed punished.
   A group of men broke into the campus residence where six of them
were sleeping. They roused the priests, their housekeeper and her
15-year-old daughter and killed them all.
   Jesuit authorities say two witnesses saw men in army uniforms
enter the house before the killings.
   In his homily at the priests' funeral, Arturo Rivera Damas,
archbishop of San Salvador, cited ``the climate of hate fostered by
the national network'' as a factor in the slayings.
   The government has installed censors at all television and radio
stations. They make sure viewers and listeners find out only what
the government believes strengthens its hand in the fighting.
   Predictably, the guerrillas are portrayed as murderous demons,
while the armed forces are presented as the epitome of virtue.
   In order to downplay the magnitude of the rebel offensive, the
simple facts _ even where the fighting was taking place _ were
often withheld.
   ``The radio says everything is getting back to normal, and
everything is under control of the armed forces and the government.
But look for yourself,'' said one passer-by in the Soyapango
district of the capital late last week.
   He pointed down the road.
   Fire from assault rifles and machine guns resounded less than a
hundred yards away, where several barricaded guerrillas defended an
intersection from army troops trying to advance.
   Some journalists have publicly made known their objections to
the government interference.
   On Nov. 22, editors and reporters of the country's principal
evening news program _ Channel 12's El Dia _ stood together before
the camera at the show's opening as the anchor read an
anti-censorship message. They then signed off indefinitely.
   ``For ethical reasons, it is impossible for us to continue our
broadcasts,'' said a solemn Antonio Mineros. ``We cannot be what we
are not.''
   Others are willing only to speak privately.
   ``Because people didn't know what was going on beyond what they
could see or hear in their own neighborhood, they didn't know what
places were dangerous and what places were safe. The lack of
information undoubtedly killed people,'' said a prominent local
radio and print newsman who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``A real fear exists that they could kill you for what you say.
Even if what you say is not against the government _ just for
describing objectively what's going on,'' he said.
   Some opposition groups have also raised their voices.
   ``Freedom of expression has been reduced to zero, making it
tremendously difficult for the democratic opposition to fulfill its
function,'' said the Popular Christian Social Movement in a
statement Thursday.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AIDS may be more widespread than previously
thought, according to a study that found the disease grossly
underreported in South Carolina.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta estimate
that 10 percent to 30 percent of AIDS cases have not been properly
reported to authorities. But a study published in today's Journal
of the American Medical Association says that of 153 AIDS cases
that should have been reported to South Carolina authorities from
January 1986 through June 1987, 62 _ or 40 percent _ went
unmentioned.
   ``If underreporting to the degree observed in this study is
widespread in the United States, current estimates regarding the
extent of the epidemic should be viewed with caution,'' the
researchers wrote in the study.
   Since the early 1980s, 112,241 AIDS cases have been reported
nationwide.
   Dr. James Buehler, a surveillance specialist on acquired immune
deficiency syndrome at the CDC, wrote in an editorial also
published in today's journal: ``Underreporting minimizes the
importance of the epidemic and threatens the public health
response.''
   Researchers led by a physician with South Carolina's Bureau of
Preventive Health Services discovered omissions in reporting the
disease by examining records of nearly 600,000 discharges from
non-government hospitals in the state, the study said.
   ``It is unclear if the present findings apply to other states,
although it seems reasonable to assume that similar underreporting
may exist elsewhere,'' the researchers said.
   They identified AIDS cases by matching symptoms reported on the
discharge records with a classification code developed by the CDC.
   Cases the researchers identified as AIDS were then compared with
those reported to the state's AIDS case registry, said Dr. George
Conway, an epidemiologist who led the study and now works for the
CDC's AIDS division.
   AIDS is one of several infectious diseases that doctors are
required under state and federal regulations to report to state
authorities, who then are to pass on the information to the CDC,
Conway said.
   ``Penalties are not very stiff for non-reporting,'' he said.
``Doctors don't get thrown in jail for not reporting diseases. The
worst they get is a letter.''
   Ninety-one of the 153 cases, or 59.5 percent, were properly
reported, the study found.
   ``Patients were significantly more likely to be reported as
AIDS-case persons if they were white than black,'' and males
patients were more frequently reported than females, the
researchers wrote.
   Conway said researchers could not explain why.
   He speculated that some might find reporting the cases too
time-consuming, or in states like South Carolina where AIDS is not
widespread, doctors may fail to recognize the disease's symptons.
   Some doctors also might be reluctant to reveal their patients'
conditions, researchers said in the study.
   In September 1987, after the period examined in the study, South
Carolina implemented an ``active surveillance program'' modeled
after those in several other states, said Dr. Jeff Jones, South
Carolina's director of disease control and epidemiology.
   Under the new program, state officials contact physicians for
information on AIDS cases, instead of waiting for them to report,
Jones said.
   AIDS cripples the body's defenses against disease, leaving a
person prey to life-threatening infections and certain cancers.

<TEXT>
   President Alfredo Cristiani
said the assault by leftist rebels was a failure and he rejected
their conditions for peace. His comments were punctuated by rebel
bombs that exploded near his news conference.
   The series of bombs exploded about five blocks from where
Cristiani was speaking to reporters Thursday evening. Cristiani
jumped, but kept talking, telling everyone ``not to worry.'' No
injuries were reported.
   Cristiani termed ``nonsense'' the guerrillas' call for political
negotiations leading to a cease-fire. The rightist government is
demanding a truce first, then talks.
   ``Without a cease-fire the guerrillas will use the peace process
for propaganda,'' said Cristiani.
   Rebel leaders traveled to Caracas, Venezuela, on Thursday to
meet with President Carlos Andres Perez. But Salvadoran government
officials didn't plan to attend the meeting, dashing any hopes of
talks.
   Perez, however, said he was in touch with Cristiani's government.
   ``I will say the same things to the representatives of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front that I said to the
ministers of the Cristiani government: We need to look for sincere
solutions,'' Perez said.
   Meanwhile, traffic moved normally in San Salvador for the first
time since Nov. 11, when the offensive that killed more than 1,000
people was launched in the capital and several provinces. Many of
the capital's 1 million residents tried to stock up on food, gas
and other necessities.
   ``We've been cooking with wood,'' said truck driver Israel
Herrera, standing in line for a fourth day at a natural gas
distributorship with 50 other people.
   ``Since I don't have any fuel for the truck I'm spending my days
in line.''
   At the Soyapango cemetery east of the city, gravediggers buried
five bodies that had been left at the cemetery gates and said they
expected more work.
   Much of the city was blacked out after darkness, and an electric
company spokesman said damage during the battles left a 70 percent
power outage.
   Cristiani said the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front had
used the negotiating process as a propaganda tool while it prepared
the largest offensive of the rebels' 10-year-old war against
U.S.-backed governments.
   The guerrilla group has said it launched its offensive to prove
that it cannot be defeated and that the country cannot have peace
without accepting the rebels as a political factor.
   The guerrillas tried to steal Cristiani's show by setting off at
least five small bombs in a ravine about five blocks away. His news
conference was interrupted shortly after he claimed the army
controlled the city, but he said ``anybody with a small group of
people'' could ``launch terrorism.''
   Cristiani was surprised, but maintained his composure. The news
conference was interrupted for 1 minute and 34 seconds, but then
resumed even as helicopters roared overhead, dropping bombs and
rocketing the slopes of a volcano where rebels were believed to be
hiding.
   Explosions continued to be heard just north of the city into the
late evening.
   The news conference was held in an open-air pavillion at
military headquarters, which has been attacked numerous times
during the war that has cost an estimated 71,000 lives.
   There was little fighting elsewhere as the country experienced a
second day of relative calm.
   ``They tried it and lost,'' said Cristiani of the rebel
offensive. He said the guerrilla group must ``come to its senses
and stop its aggression against the people. Then we can sit down to
look at the few things we can do to facilitate their incorporation
into the democratic process.''
   Fighting in the city ended Wednesday morning after 12 U.S. Army
Green Berets evacuated a luxury hotel that had been seized by
rebels.
   The guerrillas renewed a cease-fire proposal made earlier,
calling for a negotiations preceeding a truce. The government
maintains that a cease-fire should take place before substantive
political and territorial discussions take place.
   The guerrilla proposal included another clause rejected in the
past that called for the armed forces to be represented at the
talks; the guerrillas say that the army holds the real power.

<HEAD>Trials in Japan's No. 1 Scandal Get Underway With Denials</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first trial in the scandal that felled a
government and reshaped Japan's political landscape opened today
with two defendants denying bribery charges.
   The scandal is the most widespread ever in Japan, and the trials
are expected to delve deeply into issues involving the structure of
Japanese society.
   Five separate trials are starting between today and Dec. 15 on
charges against two leading politicians, six bureaucrats and four
executives of the Recruit Co., an information services conglomerate.
   The company is accused of trying to win favors and exert
influence by showering huge donations and stock bargains on the
elite of Japanese government and business.
   At today's opening session, 59-year-old Takashi Kato, a former
vice minister of labor, denied doing favors for Recruit in exchange
for shares in a subsidiary of the conglomerate. But he acknowledged
netting a $49,000 profit on shares bought cheaply from Recruit.
   ``I have considerably damaged the credibility of the labor
administration and ... I deeply regret it,'' Kato said in Tokyo
District Court, where Judge Taketaka Nakagawa presided at the
two-hour, 20-minute session.
   His co-defendant, 47-year-old Masao Tatsumi, a former Recruit
executive, denied playing any role as an intermediary between Kato
and Recruit's founder and former chairman, Hiromasa Ezoe.
   Ezoe is to be tried starting Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery.
The scandal centers on Ezoe, an ambitious entrepreneur who
bombarded senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donations
and discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary.
   Neither of today's defendants lodged a formal plea, which is not
the procedure in Japanese courts.
   The prosecution alleges that Kato influenced Labor Ministry
regulations in a way that benefited Recruit's booming business of
publishing employment magazines.
   As the trials started, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu renewed his
pledge of political reform.
   ``This is an incident that should never be repeated,'' Kaifu was
quoting as saying by the Kyodo News Service and Japan Broadcasting
Corp.
   Kaifu said his governing Liberal Democratic Party is following
new guidelines curbing political donations from corporations.
   ``I think we have to work hard on political reform,'' he was
quoted as saying.
   In August, Kaifu became the third prime minister in less than a
year after the scandal forced Noboru Takeshita to step down in
June. Takeshita's successor, Sousuke Uno, resigned after the
Liberal Democrats suffered a crushing setback in July elections for
the upper house of Parliament.
   Takeshita himself was found to have accepted $1.4 million in
legal donations.
   Now, before elections for the more powerful lower house expected
early next year, the new trials risk bringing out more damaging
disclosures.
   In trying the defendants, prosecutors must show when a gift
becomes a bribe. The determination by the court could become a
severe test of the close links between business and government in
Japan.
   The answers won't be known in full for years, given the slow
pace of justice in Japan.
   ``The Recruit case is not just another political corruption
trial, but it is a challenge to the way Japan Inc. is set up
today,'' said Hiroshi Itakura, professor of criminal law at Nippon
University. Japan Inc. is a term that refers to the relationship
between government and business.
   ``For those implicated in the case, it is almost as if they were
doing what everyone else was doing, and one day they woke up and
found themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largest
bribery cases in history,'' he said.
   Bribery carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.
   Defendants whose trials start later include Takao Fujinami, a
former chief Cabinet secretary; and Hisashi Shinto, ex-chairman of
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's largest company. The
scandals drove dozens of powerful men from their positions.

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For ordinary East Germans, sweet revenge was
a televised look inside the secrecy-shrouded compound housing Erich
Honecker and other ousted members of his reviled old guard.
   East German television aired the highly critical report
Thursday, including a talk with an indignant Honecker crony who
snapped at the ``inflammatory campaign'' waged against the
privileges of the past.
   For decades, the Wandlitz compound just north of East Berlin
represented the ultimate in perks for the country's mightiest
Communists.
   Imported wood paneling lined the walls of the 23 houses, some of
them elegant villas. Bathroom fixtures rivaled those in luxurious
houses in the West.
   The compound's own grocery store featured bananas, oranges and
other fruits that were only a picturebook dream for most East
Germans.
   Rumors abounded of all-night parties held in Honecker's Wandlitz
home, attended by the ruling elite and young women recruited from
the Communist youth organization.
   A high wall, dozens of guards and a locked gate kept away
would-be curiosity-seekers from the compound scornfully called
``Volvograd'' and ``Honecker City.'' Only a few smuggled pictures
existed of the inner area.
   Thursday night's special on state-run TV showed the insides of
one of the houses _ and hinted that the furnishings may have been
recently changed to make them look less attractive. There were also
shots of the grocery store and boutique, as well as the outside of
one fairly plain looking, stucco-covered home.
   It was the first such television report on the Communists' inner
sanctum.
   Kurt Hager, ousted from the 21-member Politburo last month,
indignantly spoke to the camera team on the Wandlitz grounds and
denounced what he called a ``inflammatory campaign'' against the
ousted Honecker inner circle.
   ``This is a necessity!'' he snapped, in defending the luxurious
lifestyle cut off from the woes of the rest of the nation. He
bitterly told a reporter all the attention gave him the feeling he
was living in an ``internment camp.''
   East Germany's new leaders, including some Honecker holdovers,
have been increasingly focusing on their predecessors' alleged
abuse of powers. That includes a disciplinary probe against
Honecker, announced Thursday night.
   Communist Party chief Egon Krenz, once Honecker's protege,
recently moved out of Wandlitz and showed a television crew around
his new more modest home on the outskirts of Berlin last weekend.
   Krenz told a television interviewer Thursday that ``retirees who
once belonged to the Politburo'' are Wandlitz's current residents
although he did not specify how many are still there.
   Fourteen Politburo members went into ``retirement'' when they
were ousted in the reshuffle that brought Krenz to power on Oct. 18.
   However, complicating matters somewhat is the fact that Guenter
Schabowski and two other Wandlitz residents are Honecker-era
holdovers in the new Politburo.
   Wandlitz was built in 1958 after the Hungarian uprising two
years earlier made East Germany's top Communists fear for their
safety. The government says that the top-ranking party members pay
rent to live there.
   Compound admnistrator Gerd Schmidt invited reporters from the
nation's state-run newspapers for a tour along with the television
crew on Thursday.
   ``There were even rumors that in the last few nights, there were
lines of trucks driving out with special goods,'' the television
report said.
   Schmidt said he couldn't confirm that, but like other East
German officials claimed that the amount of Western goods has been
drastically reduced under the Krenz leadership.
   How long Honecker and his ousted inner circle can still live
there is uncertain.
   Suggestions for Waldlitz's future use range from an old people's
home to a museum memorializing the abuses of the past.
   ``There have been thoughts about setting it up as a medical
facility or as a rehabilitation center to justly serve the
people,'' Schmidt told reporters.
   As Krenz and his colleagues scramble to gain the trust of the
people, they also have cut out other privileges, including opening
up once-restricted hunting areas to the general public.
   Many of the nation's star athletes have come under criticism for
the perks they have long enjoyed.

<HEAD>Multivitamin Use in Early Pregnancy Linked to Fewer Spinal Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing
folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear
babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new
study concludes.
   The birth defects were about one-fourth as common among babies
whose mothers took the over-the-counter vitamins than among babies
whose mothers didn't take vitamins, according to a report in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the
vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the
researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid
when they first start trying to conceive.
   The defects include spina bifida, in which incomplete closing of
the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or
severe paralysis. Another spinal column defect is anencephaly, in
which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs
within hours.
   Such defects occur in about 4,000 babies a year, or 1 to 2 in
1,000.
   The Boston University report was based on a three-year study of
22,776 women, about half of whom took multivitamins containing
folic acid.
   The occurrence of spinal column defects was 0.9 per 1,000, among
babies whose mothers took the vitamins, compared to 3.3 per 1,000
among infants born to women who didn't use supplements.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Aubrey Milunsky of the Center for
Human Genetics at the Boston University School of Medicine and
colleagues.
   ``We believe that the combined data from this and other studies
provide good evidence that folic acid-containing multivitamins
taken during the first six weeks of pregnancy will prevent'' spinal
column defects, the authors wrote.
   The study doesn't prove folic acid prevents birth defects, said
one expert, Dr. Lewis B. Holmes, a professor of pediatrics at
Harvard Medical School.
   ``Is it the vitamin itself. ... or are these women doing other
things?'' Holmes asked.
   Discussing the implications, Milunsky noted most pregnant women
see their doctors for the first time 8 to 10 weeks after conception.
   ``Almost all the fetal organs have been formed at that time,''
he said. ``An opportunity for useful intervention would have been
lost.''
   The function of folic acid _ found naturally in liver, leafy
green vegetables, mushrooms, and lima and kidney beans _ isn't
really known, Milunsky said.
   Studies haven't ruled out the possibility that vitamins A, C, D
or E _ alone or with folic acid _ protect against the defects,
since all were contained in most of the multivitamins, the
researchers noted.
   The researchers also cautioned that excessive doses of
multivitamins could be harmful.
   Researchers noted a ``strikingly higher'' prevalence of the
defects _ 13 per 1,000 _ among infants of women with a family
history of spinal conditions who didn't take supplements, compared
to women with such histories who did _ 3.5 per 1,000.
   The study group _ mostly white and well-educated _ wasn't
statistically representative of the population.
   The frequency of spinal column defects is higher among poor
whites and lower among blacks, Mulinsky said.

   The government has charged 21 students
with arson in connection with a series of fires set during
nationwide student protests in May.
   The students had been detained without charge since the
protests, which left 43 people dead.
   The 21 defendants, who were charged Thursday, pleaded innocent
and were granted bail. They each could face seven years in prison
if convicted.
   The government alleges they were caught setting fire to private
homes and government property in a Lagos suburb during the protests.
   The unrest began with student demonstrations opposing austerity
measures imposed by the military government to revive the nation's
economy.
   Most of the country's universities were closed, some for several
months, after the protests.

<TEXT>
   Nova Scotia's highest court has upheld the
largest fine ever imposed by a Canadian court on an American for
illegally fishing in Canadian waters.
   Manuel Augusto Vieira, 24, of New Bedford, Mass., was fined
$200,000 earlier this year after pleading guilty to illegally
fishing for scallops on the Canadian side of Georges Bank on June
21. He also admitted ignoring orders to stop his vessel and
forfeited $16,000 worth of scallops.
   Vieira appealed the fine, saying it was harsh and excessive.
   In its decision released Thursday, the appeals division of the
province's Supreme Court ruled that while the fines ``appear
somewhat high given the circumstances,'' it was unable to conclude
the original judge made any error rendering the sentence unfit.

   Education authorities moving to stem three
days of student unrest have ordered all students at the capital's
only university to leave campus today.
   During protests beginning Tuesday, hundreds of students
demanding larger food allowances smashed their way into storerooms
to steal meat, fruit and vegetables. More than 3,000 students
boycotted classes Tuesday.
   An official circular distributed Thursday ordered all 6,000
students to leave the campus in suburban Lusaka today.
   The circular said student protests had disrupted studies, and
authorities decided to close down the campus two weeks ahead of
Christmas vacation. Normal studies will resume Jan. 2, it said.

<TEXT>
   A jury that took five days to find a
32-year-old electrician guilty of the torture-killings of two women
on Delaware highways will have the weekend off before deciding
Monday whether he should be executed.
   The 12-member jury, which returned guilty verdicts on two of
three murder charges against Steven Pennell on Thursday, was
allowed to go home after reaching its verdict. The panel must
decide whether he should be sentenced to death or life in prison
without parole.
   Pennell was accused of killing three women in New Castle County
between November 1987 and September 1988. The jury convicted
Pennell of first-degree murder in the deaths of Shirley Ellis and
Catherine DiMauro but could not come to a verdict in the case of
Michelle Gordon.
   Jurors initially told Superior Court Judge Richard Gebelein they
had been able to reach a verdict on only one count, but after
deliberating for another 10 minutes came back with verdicts on two
counts.
   Pennell, who lived with his wife, stepdaughter, son and daughter
in a trailer park, displayed no emotion when the verdicts were read.
   Gebelein said he will declare a mistrial on the Gordon charge
and order a new trial. If the jury imposes the death penalty, the
case will be automatically appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court.
   During the eight-week trial, the jurors heard from 126 witnesses
and were shown 283 exhibits. Prosecutors said the similarities of
the wounds suffered by all three women proved they were committed
by the same person.

<HEAD>Stocks Close at Record High, Dollar Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
higher today with the market's key index setting a new high, while
the dollar edged down.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 197.55
points, or 0.54 percent, finishing the week at a record closing of
36,484.47. It followed the previous record closing at 36,286.92
with a 227.05 point gain Wednesday.
   The dollar closed the week at 143.80 yen, down 0.08 yen from
Wednesday's close of 143.88 yen. After opening at 143.89 yen, the
currency ranged between 143.80 and 143.98 yen.
   Currency dealers said the market was active in cross-trading
between the West German mark and the dollar, or the yen-mark
trading, rather than the yen-dollar trading.
   ``The yen-dollar rate remained in a tight range because of a
lack of new incentives,'' said Osamu Seto, a dealer with Mitsui
Bank.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index continued to post a record
closing over investor expectatons for higher prices, securities
dealers said. They said a recent decline in U.S. interest rates
also contributed to encouraging many investors.
   An estimated 900 million shares changed hands, an identical
amount traded Wednesday.
   ``For today, the declining U.S. interest rate helped a lot,''
said Masaya Hashizume of Nikko Securities Co., a major Japanese
brokerage.
   The Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. central bank, lowered its
federal funds rate, a short-term lending rate between commercial
banks, from 8.50 percent to 8.25 percent on Wednesday.
   Low U.S. interest rates would make dollar-denominated securities
less attractive to investors from other countries. Also lower
interest rates tend to push down the dollar's value.
   Currency and stock markets were closed in Japan Thursday, a
national holiday.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, whose brand of
``socialism with a human face'' was crushed in the 1968 Soviet-led
invasion of Czechoslovakia, is back in the limelight drawing cheers
from hundreds of thousands of countrymen.
   His public endorsement of the pro-democracy tide sweeping the
nation follows months of increasingly outspoken criticism of the
leadership that ousted him from the Communist Party 19 years ago.
   Working as a low-level employee of the state forestry services,
he remained for a long time in virtual seclusion, living with his
family in a hillside house overlooking the Slovak capital of
Bratislava.
   Permanent police surveillance of his house was lifted after a
1987 visit to Czechoslovakia by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
whose perestroika, or restructuring program largely follows the
lines of Dubcek's ill-fated ``Prague Spring.''
   Slowly and cautiously, Dubcek has prepared a return to public
life and perhaps even to a leading role, although he has kept
silent as to his plans. He celebrates his 68th birthday on Monday.
   His name has been chanted by hundreds of thousands of
demonstrators in the pro-democracy rallies that began Nov. 17 and
seem to have become a fixture in Czechoslovakia.
   The European Parliament has awarded him its 1989 Sakharov Peace
Prize, saying he ``symbolizes for all Europeans our best hopes for
peaceful reform in Eastern Europe.'' He is expected to collect the
prize in Strasbourg, France in December.
   A trip to Italy to receive an honorary doctorate a year ago was
Dubcek's first voyage abroad since he returned from a brief spell
as ambassador to Turkey in 1970, shortly before his expulsion from
the party along with half a million others.
   Milos Jakes, the current Communist Party leader, oversaw those
purges.
   Dubcek was barred from traveling again to Italy earlier this
year to attend the Italian Communist Party congress, where he could
have met one of the leading Soviet reformers, Alexander N. Yakovlev.
   Hungary made the startling move of broadcasting a lengthy
interview with Dubcek in April on state-run TV. The broadcast
prompted a formal protest from Prague to its Warsaw Pact ally.
   ``Society is trembling in the clutches of hopelessness,'' he
told the party's Politburo in a nine-page letter leaked to the
media in August, telling the leadership it would lose power unless
it changed course.
   ``Do not leave the removal of deformations of the past to either
justified pressure or chance,'' he said, anticipating growing
demands for reforms.
   In September, he sided for the first time publicly with human
rights activists in demanding the release of two dissidents accused
of anti-state activities. One has since been released and the other
was acquitted of charges against him but remains jailed pending a
prosecution appeal.
   And early this month, Dubcek's role in the ``Prague Spring'' was
given favorable footage on Soviet TV. Included was an interview in
which he spoke of ``very sad recollections'' about the crushing of
the reforms.
   To date, Moscow has not publicly disassociated itself from the
1968 invasion, saying it ``respects'' the Prague leadership's view
that the invasion was necessary. However, the parliaments of
reformist Hungary and Poland have condemned their country's
participation in the invasion.
   In an open letter published in this week's Moscow News,
prominent Soviet writer Daniil Granin apologized for the invasion,
calling it ``illegal, ruinous intervention'' that brought to power
``dogmatic Stalinists.''
   Czechoslovakia's leading opposition group, Civic Forum, has
asked Gorbachev to explicitly brand the invasion as illegal, which
would amount to a disavowal of Prague's present leaders.
   A senior non-Communist Czechoslovak politician said Dubcek
continues to have broad grass-roots support in the party and could
have a vital role in keeping it in power.
   Communists polled more than 50 percent in the last free
elections before they seized power in a 1948 coup. ``I would not
bet on them losing in a new free election if Dubcek was back in
charge,'' the politician said on condition of anonymity.

   Residents have been allowed to return to the
second of three apartment buildings evacuated Aug. 19 after a steam
pipe explosion that killed two people and showered the neighborhood
with asbestos.
   Tenants of the condominium in Gramercy Park were allowed to move
back into their apartments Thanksgiving Day, after Consolidated
Edison Co., owner of the pipe, cleaned the building of the
cancer-causing asbestos.
   Con Ed, which paid for those displaced by the blast to stay in
hotels or other apartments, will cease paying for temporary
accommodations after Dec. 4.
   In the well-to-do neighborhood on Manhattan's East Side, the
street where the blast occurred is still blocked to traffic while
asbestos decontamination continues.
   Residents of one of the three affected buildings returned home
last month. The third is expected to be habitable by January.
   The pipe that exploded is part of an underground network
carrying steam _ produced as a by-product of electrical generation
_ to customers who use it for heating and other purposes.

<TEXT>
   In a break with its guerrilla allies,
Thailand has called for a gradual, step-by-step settlement of
Cambodia's war.
   The Cambodian resistance and most governments involved in
efforts to end the war say it must be resolved with a single
package tackling all the major issues.
   However, Thailand's Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan,
impatient with slow progress toward an agreement, has said the
combatants first could agree to a truce and international
verification of a Vietnamese troop pullout.
   He said they could then take on more vexing issues, such as
power-sharing.
   Along with China, Thailand is the main backer of a guerrilla
coalition fighting the government Vietnam installed in Cambodia
with an invasion 11 years ago.
   ``The Cambodian issue must be solved, and in order to advance
toward a comprehensive solution ... we could and we should move
step by step to settle the problem,'' Radio Hanoi today quoted
Deputy Premier Bhichai Rattakul as saying.
   Bhichai spoke Thursday at a news conference at the end of a
three-day official visit to Hanoi, Vietnam's capital, with other
senior government officials and businessmen.
   According to Radio Hanoi, monitored in Bangkok, Bhichai said
informal peace talks being organized by Indonesia should be held as
soon as possible. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said
Thursday that could happen by February.
   Indonesia is among the nations that have called for a
comprehensive solution. The new talks, co-chaired by France,
represent an attempt to resume the dialogue after a month of failed
international talks in Paris in August.
   Those talks collapsed over the Cambodian government's refusal to
share power with the communist Khmer Rouge, which killed hundreds
of thousands of people in the 1970s before it was ousted by
Vietnam's invading forces. The Khmer Rouge now has the strongest
army of a three-faction resistance coalition.

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Using Lasers to Measure Atmospheric Winds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FUSSA, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Japanese scientists are flying over
the Pacific Ocean in a DC-8 jet and firing laser beams through the
atmosphere, part of a project that may double the accuracy of
weather forecasts, officials said today.
   Scientists are using the laser to measure atmospheric wind
patterns. They hope to use the measurements to design a satellite
equipped with a similar laser that will be able to measure wind
flows throughout the world, said John Theon of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration.
   ``We believe that if we can measure winds all over the globe, we
can double the accuracy of weather forecasts,'' he said. ``This
will be a breakthrough in our ability to understand weather and how
it works.''
   The NASA plane uses lasers to shoot out pulses of light that are
reflected back by dust, pollen and water particles carried by the
atmospheric winds. The delay and frequency change of the
reflections are used to calculate the wind flows in a 9-mile
cross-section of the atmosphere.
   Information from the plane's measurements will be combined with
data from nine Japanese land-based stations also using lasers to
measure atmosphere winds, Toshikazu Itabe of the Japanese Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications told reporters here at the U.S.
Yokota Air Base.
   Improved knowledge of air flows also is expected to give
scientists a better understanding of how heat and moisture are
transmitted through the atmosphere, Theon said. That should improve
the accuracy of predictions of rising global temperatures linked to
pollutants in the atmosphere that trap the earth's heat, called the
``greenhouse effect.''
   Scientists have predicted that the earth's average temperature
may rise from 3 degrees to 6 degrees F) over the next 40 years if
the amount of such pollutants in the atmosphere continue to rise at
current rates.
   Such changes could cause major climatic changes, including a
partial melting of the polar ice caps that might flood coastal
areas and entire island nations.
   ``The big remaining question regarding climate is the effect of
clouds,'' said James Spinhirne, a NASA scientist on board the
plane. ``In current climatic models temperatures could fluctuate as
much as (3.5-5.5 degrees) depending on the effect of clouds on
temperature flows.''
   The laser technique, he said, allows much more accurate mapping
of cloud patterns and movements than previous measurement methods.
   Itabe said negotiations are underway between Japan's Science and
Technology Agency and NASA on cooperation in building the satellite
system.
   NASA hopes to launch the satellite by the late 1990s, Theon said.

<HEAD>Researchers: Drug Causes Remission of Colon Cancer in Mice</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH RENDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new drug derived from a Chinese tree has
triggered remissions of colon cancer in laboratory mice, doctors
said in a preliminary report.
   ``In 20 years in this lab, we've never seen anything like this.
We have animals that are tumor-free,'' said Dr. John Stehlin,
scientific director at the Stehlin Foundation for Cancer Research
at Houston's St. Joseph Hospital.
   During two years of experiments, researchers said they treated
about 100 mice with three kinds of human colon cancer: slow-,
medium- and fast-growing. Once the mice began developing tumors,
they were divided into two groups: those receiving the new drug,
9-amino Camptothecin, or 9-AC; and those receiving no treatment.
   Most mice showed no trace of residual cancer after being treated
with 9-AC for several months, doctors said. The untreated mice died.
   Some mice treated with 9-AC are still alive after surviving the
equivalent, in human terms, of 20 years, Stehlin said at a briefing
this week.
   The findings were published today in the journal Science.
   ``This is a preliminary report,'' he said. ``Obviously, more
work needs to be done with additional colon cancers and other forms
of cancer that are not responsive to the standard anti-cancer
agents.''
   Colon cancer is the third most common cancer in the United
States with 147,000 new cases reported each year. The disease, most
commonly treated by surgery, takes about 60,000 lives annually.
   Beppino Giovanella, director of the St. Joseph Hospital
Laboratory for Cancer Research, said all three tumors used in the
experiments had not responded to major known anti-cancer drugs
administered at maximum tolerable doses.
   Giovanella also said two mice injected with lung cancer have
shown a regression of their cancer after being treated with 9-AC.
   Very little progress has been made in colon cancer treatment in
the past 40 years, Stehlin said. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy
have had little effect and the use of the drug levamisole with
5-fluorouracil improves the survival rate in about 15 percent of
patients, he said.
   Researchers said mice with the slow-growing cancer responded to
9-AC within 10 days and by 20 days were tumor-free.
   The mice with the medium-growing cancer took about 10 days to
start reacting and in about 25 days were in remission, according to
researchers. Mice treated with the fast-growing cancer took 21 days
before responding to 9-AC.
   The 9-AC drug is a derivative of camptothecin, an alkaloid
extracted from a Chinese tree. Dr. Monroe Wall of the Research
Triangle Institute in North Carolina isolated camptothecin in the
1960s.
   It was tested on humans but was soon discarded because of its
excessive toxicity. Researchers are hoping to find out whether 9-AC
is as toxic as its parent. If approved by the Food and Drug
Administration, the researchers could start tests on humans as
early as next year.
   Doctors at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore have
identified camptothecin as a potent inhibitor of topoisomerase I,
an enzyme present in animal cells which controls cell division.
Studies at New York University say cancerous colons usually have
more topoisomerase I than normal colons.

   The end of Thanksgiving can herald only
one thing at a shopping plaza: Christmas is right around the corner.
   An estimated 150,000 people watched as the Country Club Plaza
came aglow with Christmas lights Thursday night.
   Actress Dee Wallace Stone, who played in ``E.T. _ The
Extraterrestrial,'' picked a child from the crowd to throw the
switch.
   ``I'd say I've been doing it for 15 years off and on,'' said Ed
Reimman, a Chicago accountant back in Kansas City to see his
parents for the holiday. ``Now I'm bringing my own kids, just like
my folks brought me.''
   The lighting of the plaza began in 1925 when J.C. Nichols Co.
employee Charles S. Pitrat installed a few strings of colored
lights.
   Today, 47 miles of electrical wire and some 156,000 bulbs light
the shopping district featuring Spanish architecture and trendy
shops.

   A statewide campaign to send 500,000
Christmas cards to servicemen and women stationed overseas begins
today in Georgia.
   ``Project Uplift'' is being sponsored by the Georgia chapter of
the Non-Commissioned Officers Association, a non-profit fraternal
organization.
   ``Holiday time can be lonely when you are far away from home and
out of touch,'' said Joe Holden, the project's coordinator.
   Residents are asked to drop the cards without postage at
participating businesses in the state. The cards will be airlifted
by the USO Holiday Stocking Project to military bases in Europe,
the Persian Gulf, the Far East and U.S. Marine Corps attachments at
every U.S. embassy.

   High up the 220-foot Harkness Tower
overlooking the Yale campus, workmen are hoping to put the ring
back in one of the country's largest carillons in time for
Christmas.
   The Yale Memorial Carillon has been quiet since July, when
dozens of bronze clappers _ some weighing as much as 300 pounds _
were removed and taken away for refurbishing.
   The repairs will give the 54 bells that make up the carillon a
crisper, clearer tone.
   Two intrepid workers from the Verdin Co. of Cincinnati returned
to the tower this month to begin replacing the restored clappers
and reconnect them to a clavier two levels below. They hope to be
finished by mid-December.
   The Guild of University Carillonneurs, a student organization,
is responsible for playing the bells daily at noon and 5:30 p.m.
   Harkness Tower, a medieval-looking stone building topped by
turrets and pinnacles, was dedicated in 1922 with a chime
consisting of 10 bells _ part of the gift honoring the memory of
Charles William Harkness, a member of the Yale class of 1883. The
bells were cast by a firm of bellfounders in Loughborough, England,
which traces its history back to the 14th century.

<HEAD>Thanksgiving Dinner Awaited Scientist Who Emerged from Test Module</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORACLE, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientist emerged after spending three
weeks alone in a sealed, self-contained world, hungry for
companionship and Thanksgiving turkey.
   Biologist Linda Leigh ended the 21-day test Thursday, emerging
after her record-breaking stay inside a sealed, greenhouselike
module that generates its own food, air and water. The device is
part of a program to explore technologies for replicating Earth's
environment in space.
   Ms. Leigh, 39, emerged from the airtight, glass-and-steel module
just in time for Thanksgiving dinner, and was hugged by Abigail
Alling, director of the project's marine ecological system.
   ``She was quite struck by the beauty of the system,'' Ms. Alling
said in a telephone interiew.
   Wearing a bright red jumpsuit, Ms. Leigh was greeted by
co-workers, friends and reporters, but wasn't allowed to speak,
before being whisked away for a medical exam like an astronaut back
from space.
   Ms. Leigh entered the module Nov. 2 for the longest-ever stay
inside an ecosystem entirely independent of Earth's, breaking Ms.
Alling's mark of five days.
   The structure is a test for Biosphere II, a $30 million module
under construction on a ranch about 30 miles north of Tucson. Next
September, four men and four women will enter the much larger
module for two years to determine whether humans can duplicate
Earth's life systems for use in space.
   Inside the sealed system, everything is recycled _ air, water
and waste material _ and the occupants also produce all their own
food.
   Extensive medical monitoring while she was inside found the
confinement didn't seem to harm Ms. Leigh's health, doctors said.
   ``The one thing that I really do miss is just companionship,''
Ms. Leigh said Wednesday by telephone. ``Other than that, I'm quite
content on the inside. I feel like I could stay in here
indefinitely.
   Ms. Leigh's meals, averaging about 2,000 calories a day,
included such module-grown foods as sweet potatoes, kohlrabi,
jalapeno peppers and tangerines. She also had a tank of tilapia
fish.
   Water for drinking, cooking and showering was removed from the
air. All waste water was fed into a marsh recycling system.
   The botanist had to repair the loose belt of a large fan that
heats and cools the module, and had to fine-tune the irrigation
system.
   The project is being undertaken by Space Biospheres Ventures, a
company funded largely by Texas oilman Edward P. Bass.

   An unmanned barge carrying 5 million
gallons of jet fuel was snared and towed to a harbor after it
drifted for more than a day near the site of the Exxon Valdez oil
spill, the Coast Guard said.
   ``It had about 12 hours remaining until it would have hit one of
the reefs or islands at the entrance to Prince William Sound,''
said Coast Guard Lt. Daniel Bobalek in Juneau.
   The 400-foot barge was towed to Port Etches on Hinchenbrook
Island Thursday night, said Coast Guard Lt. Brian Flory.
   Workers there made hook-up adjustments necessary for the barge
to be towed 360 miles to Anchorage.
   Prince William Sound, about 20 miles north of the area where the
barge went adrift, was where the tanker Exxon Valdez hit a reef
March 24 and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil in the
worst spill in U.S. history.
   The barge, owned by Crowley Maritime Corp. of Seattle, broke
loose from a tug in storm-tossed seas Tuesday afternoon 20 miles
south of Cape St. Elias in the Gulf of Alaska. A tug skipper
reported the incident to the Coast Guard in Valdez, Guard spokesman
Ed Moreth said.
   The crew of a Coast Guard plane spotted the barge Wednesday, and
a radio buoy with a strobe light was dropped to the vessel by
helicopter, spokesman Ted French said. By early Thursday, the tug
that reported the incident had the barge on a towline, French said.
   Coast Guard officials had yet to determine why the barge broke
loose.
   Officials had considered summoning an Army ordnance team to blow
up the barge and burn off the fuel before the vessel could run
aground and spill its cargo.
   ``This episode was too close for comfort, but we are relieved
that it had a happy ending,'' said Bill Lamoreaux, an
Anchorage-based supervisor for the Alaska Department of
Environmental Conservation.
   Bobalek said it was hard to determine how much damage the fuel
would have caused if the barge's 20 cargo tanks had ruptured.

   Free food for the needy was the ransom
agreed to by the Southern California Grocers Association to reclaim
hundreds of abandoned shopping carts held hostage by the city.
   The City Council passed an ordinance about a year ago allowing
its crews to impound shopping carts left on streets and sidewalks
in Glendale, just north of Los Angeles. The city would return the
carts, worth up to $100 each, only after stores paid a $15 fee.
   The city had collected about 800 abandoned shopping carts. The
two biggest supermarket chains affected, Ralphs and Vons, would
have had to come up with about $4,000 each to get theirs back.
   With the city running out of storage space, Councilman Larry
Zarian suggested the stores donate food to Glendale's charitable
organizations in exchange for an exemption from the impound fees.
   ``As long as we are giving them back their carts, they need to
do something for this community,'' Zarian said. ``It's appropriate
during this holiday season to give to the poor and needy.''
   Association President Steven Koff said details of the food
donation plan have not been worked out.

<HEAD>After Snowy Thanksgiving, Clear and Cold in South and East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Clear skies returned to much of the East and South after a snowy
Thanksgiving, but it stayed cold today as far south as Texas and
northern Florida.
   Meanwhile, snow was expected today in the Cascade Mountains of
Oregon and parts of the Great Lakes region.
   Thursday's storm complicated holiday travel and prompted
cancellation of some high school Thanksgiving Day football games in
the Northeast. Coastal areas were hardest hit; Yarmouth, Mass., on
Cape Cod received 14 inches of snow.
   ``We are certainly starting our winter season off with a bang,''
said Jim Poirier, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
   New York City had its first white Thanksgiving in 51 years. The
4.7 inches of snow that fell there was a record for Nov. 23 and for
Thanksgiving Day.
   Light snow and snow showers were in the Great Lakes region, with
snow advisories in effect this morning in parts of Wisconsin,
Michigan and western New York state.
   Rain showers extended across the Pacific Northwest and showers
and thunderstorms were over southern Florida. But dry weather
prevailed across the rest of the nation Thursday and was continuing
today.
   Temperatures stayed below freezing all day Thursday and into
this morning across much of the area from the Dakotas through the
Great Lakes region to New England, with highs in the teens and
single digits in eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota.
   It was only 38 degrees in San Antonio, Texas, and 40 in
Jacksonville, Fla., this morning, and freeze warnings were posted
during the night for south central and southeastern Texas.
   But several southern Florida cities had record high temperatures
in the mid- to high 80s Thursday.
   Afternoon highs Thursday were in the 40s and 50s across much of
the western United States, with 70s and lower 80s in southern
California and southern Arizona.

<TEXT>
   An editorial on state-run
radio today indicated the government may soon lift some of the
emergency press restrictions in effect for more than three years.
   On Thursday, President F.W. de Klerk said officials in Boksburg
must allow people of all races to own businesses. Right-wing whites
have tried to maintain strict segregation in the city.
   The editorial broadcast on government-run Radio South Africa
said: ``The lifting of media restrictions that are no longer
relevant in today's relaxed political climate will promote a more
open public debate on crucial national issues.''
   It said the move would also help promote ``more comprehensive
and fruitful negotiations'' on the country's political and
constitutional makeup.
   The restrictions have been in place since June 12, 1986. They
cover photographing, reporting or broadcasting political unrest,
police action, statements the government considers subversive,
details about people detained without trial, and information about
boycotts.
   Under the rules, dozens of journalists have been arrested for
being at the scene of news events. Several newspapers have been
closed temporarily, and one, the New Nation, is currently under
threat of immediate closure.
   Today's editorial gave no date for when the rules would be
removed.
   Reacting to the president's decision on Boksburg, the
Conservative Party called his proclamation an attempt to ``destroy
white community life.''
   Boksburg, 12 miles east of Johannesburg, has attracted worldwide
attention since members of the far-right Conservative Party won
control of the City Council last year.
   Local lawmakers in the past year have reimposed rigid apartheid
policies, aside from the ownership ban, that were lifted when the
National Party controlled the city. These include resegregating
public toilets, the park, the library and a sports complex.
   Blacks, who outnumber the city's 50,000 whites, responded with a
boycott of white-owned businesses and have been using public
facilities in defiance of the council.
   Blacks called off the year-old business boycott last week after
de Klerk called for repeal of the Separate Amenities Act, a
national law that allows segregation of many public facilities.
Housing, schools and hospitals are not covered by the act and will
remain segregated nationwide.
   ``We've succeeded in bringing Boksburg to the attention of
people everywhere,'' said Henry Jeffreys, secretary of the
anti-apartheid Save Boksburg Committee, after de Klerk's
proclamation. ``The government had no choice but to act.''
   The national government has the authority to overrule
municipalities on some issues, including the question of whether
blacks can own businesses in downtown areas.
   De Klerk's proclamation, which allows a person of any race to
operate a business in Boksburg, is partly symbolic, Jeffreys said.
   Black businessmen probably will keep their shops in the black
townships, he said. However, there are Indian shopkeepers in
Boksburg's downtown business district who no longer face eviction
because of race, he said.
   The Indians have generally used whites to serve as front men to
obtain necessary licenses.
   The National Party, to which de Klerk belongs, was responsible
for the Boksburg law restricting business ownership to whites. The
Conservatives kept the policy when they took over last year.
   ``The government sincerely hopes that the negative image
attributed to Boksburg, both locally and abroad ... is now
something of the past,'' the minister of planning and provincial
affairs, Hernus Kriel, said in announcing de Klerk's proclamation.
   De Klerk's proclamation is the latest in a series of gestures to
the disenfranchised black majority, which still has no vote in
national affairs. The government has been allowing peaceful
anti-apatheid gatherings and last month freed several jailed
activists from prison.

<HEAD>New Program In Atlanta: Teacher Of Year Goes To Bat For Colleagues</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Teacher of the Year in this city's public
schools got a plaque, a handshake and a new job as ``teachers'
ombudsman,'' a liaison between the administration and her
colleagues in the classroom.
   In what school officials say is believed to be the first program
of its kind in the nation, the city's most honored teacher is being
asked to spend the following year representing teachers' concerns
before the superintendent.
   ``You could call me the morale officer for the school system,''
said Deborah Battle, a vocational education teacher from Carver
High School, the first ombudsman. She was Atlanta's Teacher of the
Year for 1988-89.
   Superintendent Jerome Harris said the ombudsman is a ``win-win
situation.''
   ``It provides me with an additional communication vehicle to the
teachers,'' Harris said. ``It gives some type of reward to the
teacher of the year by allowing her to interact with the system,
and she's been able to help us maneuver more with the grass-roots
people.''
   Ms. Battle's duties have ranged from helping mediate disputes
between teachers to solving payroll problems and answering
questions about retirement and sick leave.
   ``I even had a parent who came in last week,'' she said. ``She
was having a problem with her child and a teacher, and she didn't
know where to turn.''
   Ms. Battle is also working on organizing the Teacher of the Year
nominees from each school to work on developing ideas to improve
classroom performance.
   ``These people were chosen by their faculties as their most
outstanding teacher,'' she said. ``What better way to have them
provide professional leadership?''
   Ms. Battle, 38, said that she was ready to try something
different after 11 years of teaching, and likes her new post so
much that she would consider staying on the administrative side.
   ``I'm weighing my options,'' she said. ``I really am enjoying
it. ... It's a very important job, because the longer I do this,
the more I've found that on so many boards and groups of people
making decisions concerning education about education, I'm the only
teacher. I'm the only person there who can speak for teachers, as
to how something's going to be received by the children.
   ``It just amazed me that all these decisions are made _ what we
do and how we do it _ and teachers are never there.''

<TEXT>
   With batting eyelashes and smudged mascara, a
north Georgia woman is a traffic-stopping look-alike of Tammy Faye
Bakker, and is cashing in on it on the party circuit.
   Teresa Martens of Rome said she jokingly told her daughter's
modeling agent about the time she dressed up and was mistaken for
the televangelist.
   Now, ``She's the hottest thing I've got,'' said Shirley Lowry,
owner of Party People in Atlanta. Party People books celebrity
look-alikes for special events in the Atlanta area.
   ``When I tell people my list of celebrity look-alikes, people
laugh when I say Tammy Faye's name,'' Ms. Lowry said. ``Tammy Faye
Bakker is the most wanted look-alike.''
   Last month, a federal judge sentenced televangelist Jim Bakker,
Mrs. Bakker's husband, to a 45-year prison term for fraud and
conspiracy.
   At one recent appearance at a business meeting, Mrs. Martens
burst crying into the room.
   ``Look out or you'll be in jail yourself,'' she warned one
executive.
   ``I've seen you down at the Cheetah,'' she said to another,
referring to an Atlanta nude-dancing club.
   Rates are $100 an hour or $500 a day.
   Ms. Lowry said she sees potential to reach bigger markets.
   ``Teresa impresses me because she has not been in the theater,''
Ms. Lowry said. ``She is a natural comedian. She sings, she acts,
and she can portray Tammy Faye Bakker so well.''
   Mrs. Martens, 42, said she had been mistaken for Mrs. Bakker
before.
   Once when her daughter was a baby, Mrs. Martens said two women
kept looking at her during a layover in a Detroit airport.
   ``I thought, `Oh no, baby burpie, blouse undone, zipper
check,''' she said. ``I mean, these women were staring.''
   The two have never met.
   Because of the religious implications involved with her
impersonation, Mrs. Martens said she tries to be sensitive to the
fact that many people were victims in the downfall of the Bakker
empire.
   ``I want to be very careful not to offend anyone,'' Mrs. Martens
said. ``I am having fun, and people come up to me and thank me for
making them laugh.
   ``Tammy Faye Bakker does not seem to intimidate men or women,''
she added. ``People want to talk to her. They feed me questions,
and I answer them. A lot of people want to know how Jim is doing,
so I answer how I think he is doing.''

   The bodies of an elderly couple were found
floating amid the wreckage of a boat off Santa Catalina Island, and
the Coast Guard searched for a third person believed to have been
aboard the craft.
   Investigators were not able to determine what destroyed the
boat, Petty Officer Dennis Ramirez said Thursday.
   ``There were thousands of little pieces of wreckage out there,''
said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Paul McIlroy.
   The bodies recovered Thanksgiving day were identified as those
of Robert Reid, 84, and his wife, Thelma, 75, both from Hemet, said
Debrah Kitchings, an investigator with the Los Angeles County
Coroner's Office.
   The Coast Guard was searching for a third person believed by
relatives to have been aboard the boat, Ramirez said.
   There was no distress call from the boat, the Lucky R., and the
victims were found without life jackets, suggesting they had little
warning of the accident, Ramirez said.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls as Mark Strengthens, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell in quiet European trading this
morning as the West German mark continued to strengthen.
   Gold prices rallied strongly, partly on the dollar's decline.
   Foreign exchange dealers said investors turned to the mark with
expectations of higher West German interest rates and a bullish
view of developments in East Germany.
   In Frankfurt, many traders said the dollar could fall below the
psychologically important 1.80 mark level if bearish sentiment
toward the currency is supported by any important economic news.
   Such news could come next week with the release of preliminary
third-quarter U.S. gross national product data, some traders said.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.08 yen to a closing 143.80 yen. Later, in

<HEAD>Red Square Pilot Mathias Rust Accused in Stabbing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mathias Rust, the young West German
who landed his single-engine plane in Moscow's Red Square, has been
accused of stabbing a nurse who resisted when he tried to kiss her,
authorities said.
   Rust, who spent more than a year imprisoned in the Soviet Union
after he flew his plane past Soviet air defenses, turned himself in
Thursday two hours after fleeing a Hamburg-area hospital, police
said.
   The 21-year-old was working there as an orderly under the
federal Civilian Service, a pacifist alternative to compulsory
military service in West Germany, police said.
   According to police, Rust pulled an 18-year-old student nurse
into a hospital changing room, locked the door, and tried to kiss
her. When she resisted, she was stabbed twice in the stomach,
police said.
   Rust fled the hospital after the incident shortly after 2 p.m.,
but called police at 4:30 p.m. and was then taken into custody. He
was not immediately charged.
   Newspapers reported today that the teen-ager underwent surgery
and described her condition as serious.
   Authorities declined to provide other details.
   Rust captured international headlines after his dramatic feat on
May 28, 1987, when he piloted a borrowed Cessna across more than
500 miles of heavily defended Soviet territory.
   His stunt triggered a shakeup in the Soviet Defense Ministry. He
was sentenced in September 1987 to serve four years in prison after
a conviction for violating international air safety regulations,
illegal entry into the Soviet Union and malicious hooliganism.
   However, Soviet authorities pardoned him in August 1988 and
expelled him to his home in West Germany.
   He said in an interview this year that he chose the Civilian
Service because he was opposed to violence.

<HEAD>Bomb Placed By Home of Doctor Who Transplanted Soldier's Heart Into
Arab</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARIEH O'SULLIVAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities found a bomb today outside the home
of a doctor who transplanted the heart of a slain Israeli soldier
into a Palestinian, police said. An underground Jewish group said
it placed the device.
   Police found a similar crude bomb at the home of a professor who
invited a Palestinian activist to speak at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem, police spokesman Uzi Sandori said.
   An anonymous caller telephoned the Israeli dailies Yediot
Ahronot and Maariv early today and claimed a group called the
Sicarites placed the bombs at the two homes.
   ``If they do not leave the country within a week, we will wait
for them in a dark corner with a machine gun,'' Maariv quoted the
caller as saying.
   The Sicarites, named after first century Jewish zealots who
battled the Romans, have claimed responsibility for at least nine
attacks on Arabs and liberal Jews, including the machine gun
slaying of an Arab outside Jerusalem's Old City on April 10.
   No arrests were ever made in that slaying, and Sandori said no
suspects have been detained in connection with the bombs found
today.
   Sandori descibed the device found outside the West Jerusalem
home of Dr. Dov Shimon as a glass seltzer bottle rigged with
gunpowder and a candle. He said the candle was apparently meant to
set off an explosion, but both devices were found before exploding.
   The other bomb was found outside the home of Yoram Ben Porat,
who invited Palestinian activist Feisal Husseni to speak at Hebrew
University last week.
   Shimon, one of two surgeons who performed the heart transplant
on the soldier slain by Palestinian attackers, said it was not the
first time he has been threatened since the Nov. 15 operation.
   ``There have been anonymous phone calls to my wife that I was
hurt, for example, and was hospitalized. But I was at home at the
time,'' he told Army radio.
   ``I am astonished there are people in Israel who cannot separate
medicine from politics,'' he said.
   The heart was removed from Sgt. Zeev Traum, 40, who died of head
wounds suffered in an ambush by Arab guerrillas in the occupied
Gaza Strip. It was transplanted into Hanna Khader, 54, a former
hotel manager from Arab east Jerusalem.
   Hadassah Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said today that Khader
was in good condition.
   His wife, Mary, said her husband could speak and also walk with
some help but cannot yet eat solid food.
   She said she could not understand why some Jews were angry about
the transplant.
   ``They previously received organs from Arabs, so why are they
making this a problem?'' she said in a telephone interview.
   Doctors said Khader was chosen for the operation over dozens of
other Jews and Arabs on a transplant waiting list because Traum's
tissue most closely matched his.
   News of the transplant was leaked to the press, sparking angry
reactions from right-wing Israeli groups. Some Palestinians have
accused authorities of leaking the news to gain favorable publicity
for Israel.

<HEAD>Chinese Protests U.S. Congress' Action on Student Visas</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China today protested U.S. legislation that would
make it easier for Chinese students to extend their visits to the
United States if they are worried about persecution at home.
   Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu lodged the protest in a meeting
with Lynn Pascoe, acting charge d'affaires of the U.S. Embassy, the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   On Thursday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Jin Guihua said the
bill, passed by both houses of Congress, broke existing agreements
on student exchanges and contributed to the deterioration of
Chinese-U.S. relations.
   Jin said the bill was ``unacceptable'' and that China would
``make some due response.'' He did not elaborate.
   The bill would allow the more than 30,000 Chinese students in
the United States who hold exchange visitor visas visas to apply
for a change in visa status within four years.
   Currently, holders of such visas must return home for at least
two years before applying for a different visa.
   The legislation is meant to protect the thousands of Chinese
students in the United States who participated in demonstrations or
voiced support for the repressed pro-democracy movement in China
last spring.
   The bill must now go to President Bush, who has not said if he
will sign it.
   The Chinese government has vowed there will be no reprisals
against the students. However, many of the students say they are
worried they will face punishment or even imprisonment upon their
return.
   The Foreign Ministry on Sunday also protested congressional
moves to extend economic sanctions against China.
   The crackdown has strained Chinese-U.S. ties more than at any
time since diplomatic relations were established in 1979.

   A passenger bus plunged 50 feet into a
river from a bridge east of the capital, killing 78 people and
injuring 26 in the nation's worst bus crash, police said today.
   The bus apparently had a blowout on a front tire late Thursday
and hurtled into the Chivake river near the town of Murehwa, 45
miles east of Harare, authorities said. It overturned in the water,
crushing the roof.
   Police said most of the passengers were crushed to death. There
was no immediate word on how many passengers were riding in the
bus, but officials said it was overcrowded. The bus was owned by
the private Nhamburo Bus Service.
   President Robert Mugabe declared the accident a national
disaster.
   Mugabe, who visited the crash site, said the wreckage indicated
the overcrowded bus was speeding when it plunged into the river
bed. Home Affairs Minister Moven Mahachi, who also visited the
scene, said 78 people were killed and 26 seriously injured, ``and
the death toll will probably increase.''
   Several passengers died on their way to hospital after being
freed from the wreckage by firefighters with cutting torches, said
the spokesman. Rescuers were working at the scene through the night.
   First to the crash were local villagers, who used farm tools to
free some people.
   The country has suffered a record number of bus crashes this
year.
   In August, 34 people died when their bus overturned and burst
into flames about 10 miles north of Harare.
   Since September, 17 bus accidents have been reported. Bus owners
have said they cannot get hard currency to buy new tires or spares.
   In 1982, 61 farmers and their wives and children died when their
bus crashed into the Dande river near the town of Guruve, north of
Harare.

<TEXT>
   Tearful and silent, the mothers of
two Soviet soldiers captured by anti-Communist guerrillas in
Afghanistan arrived today to claim sons they haven't seen for more
than two years.
   Pvts. Andrei Lopukh and Valery Prokapchuk, both 20, will be the
first Soviet prisoners of war released since the Red Army ended
nine years of involvement in Afghanistan's civil war in February,
officials said.
   Soviet diplomats said both were captured in 1987, but Afghan
rebels earlier claimed Lopukh had deserted to their side.
   They will be released within days under arrangements nearly
completed among Afghan rebels, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry and the
International Committee of the Red Cross, the diplomats said.
   Maria Lopukh of Byelorussia and Valentina Prokapchuk of the
Ukraine wept as they arrived by chartered Aeroflot jet with a
five-member delegation including parents of other soldiers missing
in Afghanistan.
   They declined to speak with reporters.
   ``These are two very simple, plain Russian women _ suffering
women who thought they had lost their sons,'' said Iona Andronov,
spokesman of Nadezhka (Hope), a private group that works for the
release of Soviet POWs. ``But they soon will become the happiest
women in the world.''
   Soviet diplomats called the release a ``goodwill gesture'' by
the rebels, called mujahedeen or Islamic ``holy warriors, who for
11 years have fought to topple successive, Soviet-backed
governments in Kabul.
   The diplomats refused to describe it as a prisoner exchange, but
hinted that Moscow was prepared to help lobby for the release of
some rebel prisoners held by Afghan Communists.
   ``This is completely a humanitarian issue but if you are doing
something good for the Russian people, something will happen,''
Andronov said.
   Moscow claims about 310 of its men are unaccounted for in
Afghanistan. The rebels say they are holding no more than 75.
   The insurgents, backed primarily by Pakistan and the United
States, claim the Kabul government is holding as many as 35,000
rebel prisoners, many in the notorious Pul-i-Charki prison complex
outside the Afghan capital.
   The insurgents offered to release Lopukh when Andronov brought a
delegation to the Pakistani frontier city of Peshawar in June.
   However, the former soldier told a news conference he wouldn't
go home until Kabul freed all rebel prisoners. He said he had
become a Moslem, and was unsure if he wanted to go home.
   Soviet forces fought to prop up Afghanistan's Marxists, who
seized power in a 1978 coup, between December 1979 and February
1989. Moscow continues massive military aid to Kabul.
   Government forces still control the country's major cities, but
the rebels have virtual free run of the countryside. The insurgents
refuse to talk peace with Kabul officials, whom they blame for
inviting the Soviet intervention.

   A malfunctioning television set apparently
started a fire that swept through a row house on the city's west
side today, killing three people and injuring five others, a fire
official said.
   Killed in the blaze were Michelle Travers, 27, Angela Travers,
10, and Christopher Travers, 11. The children were brother and
sister but their relationship with the woman was not clear, police
said.
   A 13-year-old sister was in critical condition at St. Agnes
Hospital, as was the children's grandmother, who owned the home. A
9-year-old sister was in stable condition. The children's mother
and her fifth child, a 7-year-old boy, were treated and released.
   The fire was believed to have been ignited by a malfunctioning
television set in a second floor bedroom, said fire Captain Pat
Flynn. The home had no smoke detector.
   Gladys John, a neighbor, said she and others tried to rescue
some of the children from a second-floor bedroom.
   ``Everybody got around, telling them (the adults) to throw the
children, but the children wouldn't let go, they wanted to stay
with the mother,'' she said.

   The Coast Guard gave up hope of
finding a woman and her two young children alive in the Gulf of
Mexico after their single-engine plane crashed in turbulent
weather, officials said.
   ``We are presuming all three have drowned,'' U.S. Coast Guard
Lt. Mark Kasper said Thursday.
   Sophia Mifsud, 26, her daughter, Ariel, 3, and 2-month-old son,
Martin, were lost after the Cessna 210 piloted by Mrs. Mifsud's
husband, Thomas, crashed in stormy weather about 8:30 p.m.
Wednesday, officials said.
   The husband was treated for shock, hypothermia and minor cuts at
Memorial Medical Hospital in Corpus Christi and released.
   Mifsud, 32, a U.S. citizen who lives in Guatemala, grabbed
Martin and swam about 100 feet to an oil rig after the crash. After
climbing onto the rig's ladder, a large swell washed his son from
his hands. Mifsud never saw his son again, said Coast Guard Lt.
Robin Starrett.
   Once atop the platform, Mifsud saw his wife and daughter
floating face down in heavy seas, he told officials.
   Mifsud tried to throw them a life preserver, but apparently
missed, Starrett said.
   ``I'm sure he was exhausted at that point, in addition to being
in shock,'' said Petty Officer Ron Atteberry said. ``It looks like
he did the best he could.''
   Mifsud called the Coast Guard from a telephone he found on the
unmanned oil platform.
   He reported that the planes engine failed on a flight from
Brownsville to Houston and he ditched about 30 miles off Palacios,
a town about halfway between Galveston and Corpus Christi.

<HEAD>Moslem Leader From Britain Going to Iran to Plead for Rushdie's Safety</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Moslem leader in Britain said today he plans a
lecture tour of the Middle East, including Iran, in a campaign to
persuade that nation's leaders to revoke their death threat against
author Salman Rushdie.
   ``A price on his head is below the dignity of the Iranian
government _ it belongs to gangster movies and westerns,'' said Dr.
Hesham El-Essawy, chairman of the Islamic Society for the Promotion
of Religious Tolerance.
   He said he plans to speak at universities and to the media in
Egypt and the Persian Gulf states in February. If the Iranian
government guarantees his safety, he said he will visit there as
well.
   Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' has offended many Moslems
worldwide who say it blasphemes Islam.
   On Feb. 14, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Iranian leader who
died in June, told Moslems to kill the author. Khomeini's threat
was backed by the offer of a $5.2 million bounty by two Iranian
Moslem clergymen.
   The 42-year-old writer, an Indian-born Briton, remains in hiding.
   El-Essawy, a London dentist, said he would cite the Koran,
Islam's holy book, to support his arguments that the death threat
should be lifted.
   ``The Koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly:
If unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of God, do not
sit with them until they talk about something else,'' he said.
   ``The Koran's position is very tolerant but Khomeini said `Kill
him,''' El-Essawy said. ``I am just as incensed by Mr. Rushdie's
book as anybody else, but my reaction has to come within the
confines and teachings of the Koran. I am hoping that people will
come to their senses and the pressure will ease.''
   The London newspaper The Independent today quoted El-Essawy as
saying the Rushdie affair had harmed Britain's 2 million Moslems by
encouraging a backlash against them. On March 17, Iran broke
diplomatic ties with Britain over the Rushdie affair.

<HEAD>Ethiopian Famine May Threaten 4 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Severe drought in war-wracked northern
Ethiopia may threaten as many as 4 million people with starvation,
more than twice the number originally feared to be in danger, a
United Nations official said today.
   The new estimate was based on satellite pictures that revealed
widespread crop failures in the northernmost provinces of Eritrea,
Tigre and Wollo, said David Morton, the U.N. World Food Program
representative in Ethiopia.
   Up to 600,000 metric tons of relief food could be needed next
year to avert widespread famine deaths like those suffered in the
1984-85 famine when up to 1 million people died, he said.
   The new figures are substantially higher than those released in
October, when the United Nations appealed for 240,000 tons of food
to feed 1.8 million people based on satellite photographs that
indicated only Eritrea's crops had been severely affected by failed
rains. Only about 40 inches of rain fell this year _ half the
normal amount.
   Morton said the response to the October appeal was ``good and
fast'' and that 130,000 tons of food already had been pledged, but
that now would satisfy only about one-fifth of northern Ethiopia's
needs.
   About half the people threatened by starvation live behind rebel
lines, and Morton would not comment on how relief agencies would
get the emergency food aid to them. It also was unknown whether
Ethiopia's Marxist government would allow shipments of
international aid from its seaports into rebel-held areas.
   On Thursday, Ethiopian and Eritrean rebel peace negotiators sat
down to a traditional American Thanksgiving dinner with former
President Jimmy Carter and his wife in Nairobi, Kenya. The
negotiators settled procedural issues leading to further talks
aimed at ending their 28-year-old civil war.

<TEXT>
   East German leader Egon Krenz said in an
interview published today that he favors abolishing the Communist
Party's constitutional claim to total power, making yet another
concession to the pro-democracy movement.
   But while explicitly advocating the removal of the
constitutional provision guaranteeing the party a monopoly on
power, he made it clear he expects the party to remain a leading
force.
   In other developments today, West German officials reported a
sharp rise in East German requests for permanent resettlement
there. In the past 24 hours, 2,000 such requests were received,
compared to 865 in the 24-hour period before that, they said.
   Leaders of the government-run labor union requested an
investigation of Harry Tisch, an ousted Politburo member and the
former government labor chief, whom they accused of abuse of power.
   On Thursday, the Communist Party announced it had opened a probe
of ousted leader Erich Honecker.
   Krenz, a former Honecker disciple now trying to distance himself
from his old mentor, said in a television interview Thursday that
he would step down if the party asked to leave during a party
congress next month.
   The party Thursday also revoked the membership of Honecker's
former economic czar, who was thrown out of the ruling Politburo in
the purge last month that launched a wave of reform and opened up
the Berlin Wall.
   The moves reflected the party's desperate attempts to restore
its sinking credibility and authority.
   Meanwhile, pro-democracy demonstrations continued with about
10,000 protesters rallying in the city of Erfurt on Thursday night,
said East Germany's ADN news agency.
   In an interview published today by the Communist party daily
Neues Deutschland, Krenz called for major constitutional changes to
separate the party, state and economy.
   Asked by the interviewer about the country's deep political
crisis, Krenz mentioned the constitutional provision guaranteeing
Communist authority and said, ``We are in favor of abolishing it.''
That is one of protesters' main demands.
   But when asked about demands by pro-democracy demonstrators for
curbing party ``interference'' in all aspects of life, Krenz
replied: ``One has to say very clearly that we will interfere with
all our energy. Not least because we represent a considerable part
of the population, particularly the working class.''
   He added, ``We are not a corrupt party.''
   Krenz said hard-line policies of the past decades caused ``many
basic mistakes, ultimately the crisis of our society.''
   The disciplinary investigation against the ailing Honecker;
former economy czar Guenter Mittag; and two other former officials
was based on ``grave abuses'' of the party statute and
``responsibility for the current situation in the party and the
country,'' ADN said without elaborating Thursday.
   ADN also said that Mittag was expelled from the party.
   The party's probe of Honecker and other former senior officials
could result in various sanctions ranging from an official rebuke
to expulsion from the party.
   Krenz replaced Honecker on Oct. 18. Honecker led the country for
18 years, staunchly resisting the kind of reforms launched by
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev nearly five years ago.
   Krenz has embraced a program of reforms and concessions to
opposition demands, including the long-denied freedom to travel,
the promise of free elections, and sweeping changes in the economy.
   But the dramatic changes have failed to shore up the party's
standing and Krenz's own credibility among the citizenry, which has
staged massive demonstrations to press demands for more democracy.
   Krenz, 52, long viewed as a hard-liner, said in an interview
with West Germany's ARD television network Thursday that he had
been ``inspired by the new thinking of Gorbachev.'' He said 1985,
when Gorbachev came to power, was ``decisive'' for him.
   Krenz also said he had talked several times to Honecker by
telephone and that the former leader ``accepts that he is largely
responsible for this situation.''
   That was a reference to the political and economic crisis that
led nearly 300,000 East Germans to leave the country this year and
sparked massive pro-democracy demonstrations nationwide.
   East German officials already have said a parliamentary
commission was looking into charges of misuse of power and
corruption against Honecker and his inner circle.
   ADN said doctors had decided that Honecker was too ill to make
any statements in the proceedings. The 77-year-old former leader
has had severe medical problems since a gall bladder operation
earlier this year.
   Krenz said he hadn't taken over as leader for a short-term
period but emphasized that a decision on his fate was up to next
month's special party congress, and that he would step down if
asked.
   Earlier, East Germany announced a package of measures aimed at
stopping the massive smuggling of currency and consumer goods out
of the troubled nation.
   Since East Germany lifted travel restrictions on Nov. 9, the
Communist government has been wrestling with a growing black market
and smuggling on a scale not seen since before the Berlin Wall was
built in 1961.

   Three shots were fired today at a
polling booth where opposition leader Vishwanath Pratap Singh had
gone to investigate reports of election fraud, Singh and witnesses
said.
   No one was hurt, and it was not known who fired the shots.
   Singh refused to say if he thought the shots were aimed at him,
but one witness said: ``It was very close. It was obvious that the
target of the gunmen was Raja Sahib.''
   Singh is often called ``Raja Sahib,'' which means ``King Sir.''
   Shots rang out as Singh got out of his car in the village of
Dubrai, in Uttar Pradesh state, where he had gone to investigate
reports that workers from Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's Congress
Party were rigging polls.
   The witness, who is not affiliated with Singh's opposition
coalition, said the gunfire began as Singh was surrounded by a
crowd of people who had alleged the ballot-fixing. The witness
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Another person at the scene also reported the shooting but said
he could not tell if the shots were aimed at Singh.
   Anand Sharma, chief spokesman for the Congress Party, was asked
in New Delhi about the shooting. He replied that opposition
supporters were ``responsible for all the violence'' in the area.
   Today was the second of three days of voting in a parliamentary
election, in which Gandhi faces the most determined challenge ever
mounted by the country's usually splintered opposition.
   Singh's Janata Dal Party and the Congress Party have traded
charges of widespread fraud and intimidation, and election-related
violence has killed at least 106 people.
   The Election Commission said today it has ordered a revote at
930 of the country's 590,000 voting booths following fraud reports.
   In comments earlier today, 58-year-old Singh said, ``The
Congress is bent upon creating trouble here, but I am not going to
allow that.'' In his wake, villagers armed with batons and spears
screamed ``Death to the Congress!'' and vowed to protect voters
from troublemakers.
   Gandhi headed to Punjab state, which votes Sunday, for a last
campaign swing.
   At a rally in Bhatinda, he accused neighboring Pakistan of
arming and training Sikh separatists, who have killed about 1,640
people this year in their fight for a separate nation in Punjab.
Pakistan has denied such allegations.
   In the first hours of voting today, clashes between Congress
Party and Janata Dal supporters were reported in Calcutta and
eastern Orissa state, but there were no immediate reports of deaths.
   A total of 106 people have been killed in campaign-related
violence since Oct. 17, when elections were announced. Since voting
began Wednesday, 62 people have died.
   At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the Lok
Sabha, or House of the People, Parliament's policy-making lower
house. No results will be announced until after the last polls
close Sunday.
   Few real issues were at stake in the campaign, apart from Gandhi
himself, who has been dogged for half of his five-year term by
allegations of corruption in high government circles.
   The National Front, an opposition coalition spearheaded by
Singh's Janata Dal party, has promised to provide clean government.
   But Gandhi told voters the only party capable of governing is
his Congress Party, whose most famous leaders were his grandfather
and mother, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and Prime Minister
Indira Gandhi.
   Gandhi was swept into office on a wave of sympathy after his
mother's assassination in 1984, winning 415 of Parliament's 543
seats. However, recent polls indicated he could lose the election
or be forced into an unwieldy coalition with smaller parties this
time.
   The Congress Party has governed India for all but 29 months
since the country became independent 42 years ago.
   Voting today was spread across 10 states and two federally
governed territories, where a total of 264 million people were
eligible to vote.
   The total number of eligible voters is 498 million. Most of the
rest of India's 25 states and seven territories voted Wednesday. On
Sunday, voting will take place in three states.
   Elections for the 14 seats in northeastern Assam state have been
postponed indefinitely because of incomplete voter rolls, and a few
other contests were delayed because of candidates' deaths.

   Salvadoran guerrilla leaders flew to
Venezuela, met secretly with President Carlos Andres Perez, and
flew out again at dawn today, a government source said.
   The leaders of the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, or FMLN, flew on a commercial flight from Panama, and met
with Perez at the presidential palace, said a government source
close to the conversations.
   The two men and a woman who represented guerrillas battling the
U.S.-backed Salvadoran government were Leonel Gonzelez, Miguel del
Carmen and Maria Marta Valladares, said the source, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Perez said Thursday he would meet with the guerrillas in an
effort to renew stalled talks between the FMLN and the rightist
government of Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Perez met with Cristiani's envoys on Tuesday.
   There was no official word of the talks or on what was discussed.
   Venezuela is seeking to be a mediator in settling the
decade-long conflict that has cost some 70,000 lives.
   Talks had been scheduled between the government and the rebels
on Monday in Caracas, but a guerrilla offensive that began Nov. 11
and took the war into downtown San Salvador for the first time put
the contacts on hold.
   Meanwhile, the Cristiani government on Thursday dismissed a
cease-fire proposed by the FMLN, calling it a propaganda maneuver
and urging the rebels to lay down their weapons.

   Police and army units raided a drug
traffickers' fortress and apparently came close to capturing the
head of the notorious Medellin cocaine cartel, police said today.
   The newspaper El Tiempo reported that the cartel leader, Pablo
Escobar, fled into the jungle wearing only his pants. Officials did
not confirm this.
   El Tiempo said two of Escobar's bodyguards were killed and 55
people were arrested in the raid, which took place early Thursday.
   Hundreds of troops from government security forces blocked roads
throughout the area, 70 miles west of Medellin, in an attempt to
catch Escobar, El Tiempo said, and helicopters patrolled the area
to prevent him from fleeing by air.
   Army troops and members of a special police anti-drug unit, not
told where they were going, headed out in helicopters and raided
the ranch in central Colombia, El Tiempo and two other Bogota
dailies, El Espectador and La Prensa, said.
   El Tiempo, quoting officers commanding units of the troops
involved, said Escobar, who is wanted in the United States, ran
into the jungle wearing only pants.
   It quoted police as saying they are sure it was Escobar who fled
because he left behind a shirt with documents in it belonging to
him.
   National Police spokesman Octavio Vargas said today that it is
believed Escobar and another Medellin member fled during the raid.
He spoke during an interview with the Colombian radio network
Caracol.
   La Prensa, quoting police sources, said Escobar and another
member of the Medellin cartel were at a meeting at the ranch when
the police moved in.
   The office of President Virgilio Barco said in a communique
today the raid was on an operations center of the Medellin cartel
but it did not mention Escobar.
   The police seized automobiles, boats, weapons, ammunition and
communications equipment, El Tiempo said.
   Escobar, 39, tops the U.S. Justice Department's list of the 12
most wanted drug traffickers in Colombia.
   The Justice Department says he traffics in cocaine, marijuana,
and possibly heroin and has been indicted five times in the United
States on drug- trafficking, conspiracy, racketeering and
obstruction of justice charges. He is named in indictments in
Florida, Louisiana and Colorado.
   A former alternate senator from Medellin, he faces a 1986
indictment in Colombia for the murder of a newspaper owner.
   None of the 12 suspects on the Justice Department list has been
captured.

<HEAD>Japanese Apple Poses Economic Threat to Michigan Growers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's latest economic threat to
Michigan doesn't roll off a production line _ it drops from a tree.
   The Fuji apple is described as sweeter, larger and
longer-lasting than varieties grown in Michigan, the nation's
second-largest apple producer after Washington.
   It's also more expensive and takes longer to grow, but apple
growers say the Fuji may be the apple of tomorrow.
   ``In the future, flavor and crispness will be more important
than red, shiny apples,'' said Roger Kroph, a major grower-packer
in the Grand Rapids area. ``We're in a world market now, and the
Europeans have always chosen taste over looks.''
   The Japanese variety is beginning to appear on supermarket
shelves, and analysts predict a healthy market for the Fuji.
   ``It stays crisp and juicy in storage long after other apples
have turned mushy,'' said Jerome Hull, a pomologist, or orchard
scientist, at Michigan State University. ``That means big
supermarket orders.''
   Growing the Fuji in Michigan would mean developing a new strain,
Hull said. Its six- to seven-month growing season is two months
longer than the state's season.
   California growers are entering the apple market for the first
time simply to grow the Fuji. Their counterparts in Washington,
plan a major shift toward the Fuji after overproduction of Red
Delicious depressed the value of the crop there.
   The new breed of apple doesn't exactly spell disaster, Michigan
growers said.
   ``Chrysler survived. Honda just took a piece of the market,''
said Kroph. ``The Fuji will be just another variety, and it will be
a long time coming. It takes 10 years to put a tree into
production.''
   Michigan grows eight varieties of apples and produces more than
1 billion pounds a year. The Fuji sells for about 99 cents a pound
in the Detroit area, compared with 59 cents a pound for Michigan
and Washington Red Delicious apples.

   The Thanksgiving Eve opening of
Michael J. Fox's ``Back to the Future Part II'' took in $7 million
in what Universal Pictures called the biggest-ever midweek box
office gross.
   The sequel to 1985's mega-millions hit opened Wednesday on 1,866
screens nationwide and the first-day take was $7 million, said Alan
Sutton, a Universal spokesman.
   ``That was the biggest Wednesday box office gross ever in the
motion picture business,'' he said.
   The previous box office champ on an opening Wednesday was
``Rocky 4'' in 1985 with a $5.7 million turnstile take. ``Batman,''
which opened on a Friday this year, holds the non-opening Wednesday
record with $6.6 million.
   ``Back to the Future'' also opened over a five-day holiday
period _ the extended Fourth of July weekend in 1985 _ and its
five-day opening gross was $14.9 million. The film ended up doing
$350 million worldwide.
   Universal will continue to capitalize on the popularity of Fox,
whose role as conservative Alex Keaton on ``Family Ties'' endeared
him to millions of television viewers.
   A third ``Back to the Future'' movie is scheduled for release
this summer.

   Guards angered over the firing of a union leader
have occupied all 24 provincial prisons and detention centers in
Quebec and locked prisoners in their cells, a spokesman for the
guards' union said today.
   City and provincial police surrounded some of the facilities and
have threatened to go in and remove the guards, spokesman Pierre
Valiquette said.
   Forty-five guards occupied the command center of Parthenais on
Thursday after officials fired Pierre Gaummound, head of the union
at Montreal's Parthenais detention center, Valiquette said.
   Essential services, including food and medical services, will be
provided, but until Gaummound is rehired, management staff will be
kept out and prisoners will remain in their cells, Valiquette said.
   ``They tried to kill the union by cutting off its head,'' he
said.
   Contract negoiations with the province's 1,500 guards broke down
two months ago, Valiquette said, adding that the guards have been
without a contract since January 1988.
   Eleven prisoners have been locked out of Parthenais and may have
to be sent home, said one who identified himself only as a
``criminal.'' The prisoners left the prison on a work detail the
previous night.
   ``We haven't had breakfast yet; tell the director they haven't
fed us,'' one prisoner shouted from his second-floor window in the
gray stone building, which was surrounded by police.
   The provincial jails range in size from a couple of dozen
prisoners to several hundred at centers such as Parthenais and
Bordeaux in Montreal. The prisoners are serving terms of two years
or less. The provincial jails also hold prisoners awaiting court
appearances.
   The main issues in negotiations are revised job descriptions,
work hours and wages.
   The guards want changes to shift schedules.
   They now work seven days followed by three days off, and then
seven days followed by four days off.
   Guards with five years' experience earn $31,836 a year. The
government's latest offer would increase their salary to $37,900 in
1991.

<TEXT>
   Communist Party chief Nicolae
Ceausescu, who has staunchly opposed the democratic reforms
sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe, was re-elected to another
five-year term today.
   The party's 467-member Central Committee unanimously chose
Ceausescu _ the only candidate. Delegates to the 14th Communist
Party Congress greeted the selection with cries of ``Ceausescu,
CPR!'' the abbreviation for the party.
   Delegates also approved an economic and social program ``for the
next five years and beyond'' that would further strengthen the
party's near-total control over the daily lives of Romanians. No
details of the plan were given.
   Ceausescu, 71, also called for the annulment of the 1939
Soviet-Nazi Germany treaty that agreed to the partition of much of
Eastern Europe among the powers, the official news agency Agerpres
reported today.
   In talks with Communist delegations, he said the treaty should
``be considered wrong and officially annuled with all its
provisions, including its secret provisions.'' One provision ceded
the Romanian province of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union and gave
Moscow control over the three Baltic states.
   The talks elaborated on comments he made Monday, when he
indirectly appeared to urge the return of Bessarabia, which is now
Soviet Moldavia. But he has made no specific demand to Moscow for
the return of the territory.
   Ceausescu also proposed an international conference of Communist
and socialist parties to discuss the ``many problems ... of
socialist construction,'' Agerpres reported.
   As he spoke in the downtown Palace Hall, thousands of workers
and youths gathered outside, shouting pro-Ceausescu slogans. State
radio said 125,000 people turned out. It was not possible to
confirm the figure independently.
   Ceausescu, the longest-serving party leader in Eastern Europe,
has so far rejected reforms similar to those that have gripped
other Soviet bloc countries and have most recently shaken
Czechoslovakia.
   His intolerance of any opposition had led to the most repressive
atmosphere within the Soviet bloc even before the onset of changes
elsewhere.
   His insistence on prompt repayment of a $23 billion foreign debt
brought on a harsh austerity movement that caused shortages of food
and many consumer goods. His government's program of razing ethnic
Hungarian villages has led to his condemnation by human rights
groups.
   However, the five-day party congress, which ends today, has been
filled with speeches lauding his efforts and calling him ``a hero
of the nation.''
   Officials said earlier that the re-election of the man who has
led Rmania since 1965 would be a formality because ``there is
nobody foolish enough to oppose him.''
   Ceausescu indicated that at his international conference, he
would like to form an alliance of orthodox Communists to
counterbalance the reform wave gripping all six other Warsaw Pact
nations.
   ``We must not necessarily wait until every party is ready to
attend,'' Ceausescu was quoted as saying. ``The parties that wish
to meet and discuss the problems of strengthening their solidarity
and collaboration in the fight against imperialism ... must meet.''
   Ceausescu said the annulment of the 1939 Nazi-Soviet pact
``should be done for the past and present and for the future
alike.'' He said it was ``important as a lesson for the present and
the future.''
   ``The world issues, including the nuclear issues, cannot be
settled by the two powers alone,'' he said.
   He also warned the world to ``beware today, too, of a possible
new accord between the U.S. and the Soviet Union to the detriment
of other peoples.''

<TEXT>
   The government rejected an American reporter's
application to work in this island-republic and denied permission
to a second journalist seeking to extend his employment pass.
   No reason was given for the decisions, and officials refused to
elaborate today. Both reporters work for the AP-Dow Jones News
Service.
   The employment pass, required by foreigners employed in
Singapore, was denied Matthew K. Geiger, a U.S. citizen who was to
have been assigned from New York.
   A letter signed on behalf of the Controller of Information,
dated Nov. 18 and received Thursday by AP-Dow Jones in Singapore
said, ``I regret that the application is not approved.''
   Geiger applied for the pass on Sept. 28 to replace Simon Elegant
as regional correspondent for the financial news service.
   Elegant's request for a two-month extension of his employment
pass was denied in October, and he left Singapore after being based
here three years.
   ``We are puzzled by this action and will be seeking further
information about why it was taken,'' AP-Dow Jones Managing Editor
James Furlong said in New York.
   AP-Dow Jones is jointly owned by The Associated Press and Dow
Jones and Co. Dow Jones also is majority owner of The Asian Wall
Street Journal and sole owner of the Far Eastern Economic Review.
   Singapore has refused to let the Asian Journal base a reporter
in the country since mid-1988 and has refused to let the Review
base a reporter here since mid-1987.
   Since February 1987, Singapore has restricted circulation of the
Asian Journal to 400 copies a day from about 5,000 previously.
   The Review's circulation was restricted to 500 copies a week in
December 1987, down from about 9,000.
   Both Hong Kong-based organizations had their circulations
slashed under a 1986 amendment to the Newspapers and Printing
Presses Act that enables the government to restrict the sale and
distribution of a publication that is deemed to be engaging in
domestic politics.
   Both denied that any articles appearing in their pages
constituted such interference.

   Motorists who thought they were unlucky
when they locked their keys in their cars just saw their luck take
a turn for the worse.
   Beginning the first of the year, police in this south Chicago
suburb will be telling drivers: don't call us, call a towing
service.
   ``It's nonproductive as far as police time,'' said Park Forest
Police Chief James Rice, whose office responds to some 900 calls
for help from locked-out drivers each year.
   Handling each call takes about 25 minutes on average, adding up
to about 56 police-officer days each year, he said. And those
high-tech electronic locks on newer model cars make them even
harder to break into.
   ``Even manual locks have changed and aren't easy to unlock,''
said Rice. With the newer, trickier locks, cars are sometimes
damaged in the process, he said.
   ``We don't like to deal with the liability and the damage,'' he
said.
   Drivers on the outside looking in at their keys will be referred
to locksmiths and towing companies.

<TEXT>
   Dissident Vaclav Havel today
accepted the Olof Palme human rights award and said his Communist
country was the last in central Europe to rise up to demand
democratic changes.
   The 53-year-old playwright, whose works have been banned by
Communist authorities at home but produced to acclaim
internationally, received the $15,500 award from Swedish Foreign
Minister Sten Andersson in a ceremony at the Swedish Embassy.
   The award follows a week of unprecedented protest in
Czechoslovakia as hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the
streets to demand the resignation of the nation's hard-line
Communist leadership.
   In a brief speech, Havel said his nation was ``the last country
to wake up'' in central Europe.
   ``We are de facto an occupied country,'' Havel said, apparently
referring to the Soviet troops who stayed in Czechoslovakia after
leading a 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement. He appealed for international support for
the current burgeoning pro-democracy movement.
   Havel, a member of the Charter 77 human rights group who has
served three years in jail since 1979 for his criticism of the
nation's Communist leaders, canceled earlier plans to travel to
Sweden to receive the award because of the upheaval in
Czechoslovakia.
   The award is named after Olof Palme, the Swedish prime minister
slain in 1986. Cyril Ramaphosa, a black South African union leader,
won the first award in 1987, and last year it went to U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar.

   Frances Bavier, who played the devoted
and doting Aunt Bee on televison's ``The Andy Griffith Show,''
remained hospitalized in a coronary care unit, a spokeswoman said
today.
   Ms. Bavier's condition was not released at her request, said
officials at Chatham Hospital, where she was admitted Wednesday.
   Ms. Bavier, 86, has lived in Siler City for many years and has
refused requests for interviews for some time. ``She's a very
private person,'' said Roger Harrell, hospital administrator.
   Before her role in the long-running 1960s series starring Andy
Griffith as a Southern sheriff, Ms. Bavier appeared on Broadway in
such productions as ``Kiss and Tell,'' ``Point of No Return,'' and
``The Lady Says No.''
   She also reprised the Aunt Bee character on a short-lived sequel
to the Griffith show, ``Mayberry R.F.D.''

   A former security policemen
said a police major in the anti-terrorist unit was involved in
killing anti-apartheid activists, a newspaper reported today. He
was the second former officer to make the allegation.
   Also today, a newspaper said the police major, Eugene de Kock,
has been called to testify at two inquests involving the deaths of
eight activists.
   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok suggested today that the
allegation of the death squad is part of a plot by black militants
to discredit the police.
   Butana Nofomela and David Tshikalange, who have said they were
members of a police death squad, alleged that de Kock commanded the
squad from 1983 and was linked to the killings of activists.
   ``The name of Maj. Eugene de Kock has increasingly emerged as
the new leader of the police's alleged murder gang,'' said Free
Weekly, an anti-apartheid Afrikaans-language newspaper.
   Free Weekly today quoted Tshikalange as saying de Kock was the
field commander of the death squad. Tshikalange said that in 1983
he saw the body of a slain man, wrapped in plastic and with blood
on the head, in the trunk of de Kock's car.
   Nofomela, who is on Death Row for a killing unrelated to the
alleged death squad activities, said in an affidavit made public
earlier that he saw de Kock shoot security guard Japie Moponye in
the head in 1985. Moponye was the brother of a suspected African
National Congress guerrilla.
   Nofomela, Tshikalange, and a third ex-policeman, former Capt.
Dirk Coetzee, have admitted taking part in numerous killings of
anti-apartheid activists in South Africa and in neighboring
countries.
   Coetzee said he headed an anti-terrorist unit that he said acted
as a death squad until 1982. De Kock took over the same
anti-terrorist unit in 1983, Free Weekly and Weekly Mail reported
today.
   Tshikalange and Coetzee have fled South Africa. Nofomela has
been granted a stay of execution while the allegations are
investigated.
   Police have denied the existence of an authorized death squad
but say it is possible that renegade officers killed government
opponents on their own.
   President F.W. de Klerk has not commented on the case and is not
expected to do so until he reviews a report by Vlok.
   Vlok said the African National Congress and the South African
Communist Party, both outlawed, are attempting to ``break down the
morale of the police'' with the allegations.
   ``They have lost (their military campaigns) but their goal has
not changed,'' Vlok said. ``They must get the police and the
security forces out of their way to make it easier to bring about
their aim of creating a communist state.''
   The Weekly Mail said de Kock has been called to testify in two
inquests involving eight deaths.
   In one incident, four black men were killed near Durban in 1986.
Nofomela has said he was present and that de Kock was the officer
in charge.
   In the second incident, four blacks were killed in a shooting
near the South Africa-Swaziland border last year.

   Police today found a time bomb in
luggage taken from a Saudi Airlines jumbo jet, and only a loose
wire stopped it from exploding over the Arabian Sea with 248 people
aboard, officials said.
   ``We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged,'' said
an officer of the paramilitary Karachi Airport Security Force, who
identified himself only as Ashraf.
   A security force commander who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the bomb would have destroyed the terminal of Karachi's
airport in addition to the plane had it gone off after the jet
landed.
   Only a loose battery wire prevented it from blowing up Thursday
night as the plane flew from Islamabad to the Saudi city of Riyadh,
said the commander.
   The officials said they questioned all passengers and crew
members but had not made any arrests. They refused to say if they
had any suspects or whether any group claimed responsibility.
   A taxi driver delivered an envelope to an Islamabad Airport
security officer soon after Saudi flight 367 departed for Riyadh at
about 6 p.m. Thursday, security force officials said.
   It contained a note threatening to destroy the plane unless
authorities paid $1.5 million, they said. The jet was over the sea
when the Karachi control tower relayed the threat and called it
back to land.
   After the airliner was emptied of passengers and luggage,
officers found an unclaimed school bag containing the explosive
device. It was set to go off at 7:20 p.m., when the aircraft was
over the water.
   Asked how someone could have smuggled the bomb past Islamabad
airport security, Col. Noor Khan of the Islamabad Airport Security
Force said:
   ``It's not understood how they did it. Everything is there and
working,'' in a reference to airport security devices.
   Travelers embarking on international flights from Islamabad
normally have their baggage inspected manually by customs agents
and then screened by X-ray. Passengers with boarding cards then
pass through a metal detector, receive a body search, and their
carry-on luggage is X-rayed a second time.
   Law enforcement specialists were examining the aircraft today,
and a joint investigation was under way in Islamabad and Karachi,
sources said.
   A terrorist bomb exploded in December aboard a Pan Am Boeing 747
over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Investigators later
said the bomb was hidden in a cassette-recorder.

   After a day at home to ponder their blessings, Americans piled
into shopping malls today as the traditional kickoff of the
Christmas shopping season got under way.
   ``We're off to a good start,'' said Mary Lynne LaRochelle,
manager of Levinsky's discount clothing store in Freeport, Maine,
which opened to waiting customers at 7 a.m. ``Our sales are up from
last year.''
   Strong sales were reported elsewhere as well. At the Acadiana
Mall in Lafayette, La., spokeswoman Sherry Bouttee said the parking
lot was filling up rapidly by midmorning and some shoppers probably
would have to park in nearby fields.
   Animal rights activists planned nationwide protests against fur
sales. In Miami, workers at Grove Cleaners and Furriers arrived
today to find red and blue paint covering the front windows and
graffiti on a van parked out front.
   A spokeswoman for the Animals Rights Foundation of Florida
denied responsibility for the vandalism.
   Today's shopping spree followed a white Thanksgiving for many
people in the East and South. The holiday was an occasion for the
needy to count life's few blessings in homeless shelters and soup
kitchens around the nation.
   Giving thanks was on the minds of thousands of victims of
Hurricane Hugo, northern California's earthquake and other natural
disasters that jolted the nation this year.
   ``We are alive. We have more reasons to give thanks than we do
to be sorry,'' said Mabel Martin, owner of a trailer park in
Alorton in southern Illinois that was devastated by a Nov. 15 storm
that caused an estimated $5.3 million in damage.
   The snow that fell from Virginia to New England canceled high
school football games in the Northeast, but neither a wascally
wabbit who wouldn't waft nor a fallen Humpty Dumpty dampened the
spirits of millions of parade watchers.
   ``This is the snowiest Thanksgiving. Period,'' said
meteorologist Harry Woodworth at the National Weather Service in
Newark, N.J., where more than 5 inches of snow fell.
   Up to 8 inches of snow fell in Massachusetts, and 5 inches was
reported at Snowshoe ski resort near Marlinton, W.Va. Baltimore
residents woke up to their first white Thanksgiving since 1971.
   The first Thanksgiving snow in New York since 1938 grounded the
Snoopy and Bugs Bunny balloons from the 63rd Annual Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade, but an estimated 1.8 million people still
lined the parade route.
   ``I would have come out here even if it was 20 degrees below
freezing. It's a million times better live,'' said 32-year-olt Mike
Koleba, wrapped in an army jacket, two hats and a scarf.
   The 70th annual Thanksgiving Day parade in Philadelphia survived
a record snowfall, but the 55-foot Humpty Dumpty balloon had a
great fall when it was punctured by a light standard.
   Some 900,000 people braved temperatures in the 20s Thursday in
Detroit to watch the 63rd Annual Michigan Thanksgiving Day Parade.
   In an out-of-this-world meal, Discovery's astronauts celebrated
in space with thermo-stabilized turkey, freeze-dried vegetables and
cranberry sauce. Jyso????O??
@? wife enjoyed a traditional Thanksgiving
dinner that included roast turkey with stuffing and cranberry
sauce, sweet potatoes topped with marshmallows, green beans, salad
and pumpkin and pecan pies at the retreat in Camp David, Md.
   Meanwhile, at a holiday feast at the Los Angeles Rescue Mission,
actor Ben Vereen asked the president to do more for the homeless.
   ``I will not pray for you,'' he told the mission diners. ``I
will pray for the administration to do something for you.''
   A laid-off bank president was among those served at a Salvation
Army center in Massachusetts, but it was the children who were
among the victims of the state's slumping economy that most touched
the hearts of volunteers.
   ``They often wonder why they are going to this strange place,
but when they're eating good food there is a real warm feeling for
the whole family to see,'' said Salvation Army spokesman Stephen
Copaccio.
   A man in Woonsocket, R.I., helped the needy revel in the
kindness of others after his ministry received 458 donated turkeys.
Last week Paul Dempster, director of Because He Lives Ministries,
had only three turkeys and a guest list of about 70 people.
   He called friends, newspapers and radio stations looking for
more.
   ``I told them I needed help getting the word out,'' said
Dempster. By Thursday morning he was inundated with 458 turkeys, he
said.
   In the San Francisco Bay area, many survivors of the Oct. 17
quake gave thanks by serving holdiay meals to their less fortunate
neighbors.
   ``Here we can really give thanks and be grateful that we are
still here despite the destruction and death; this is a time when
we can come together.'' said the Rev. Cecil Williams of Glide
Memorial United Methodist Church, where 6,000 people were treated
to dinner.
   A killer tornado did not stop an Alabama couple from having
their planned Thanksgiving wedding. Wayne Stinson of Huntsville
said his wedding vows to Wanda Clark from a hospital bed, where he
was recovering from storm injuries.
   ``y?hd be an e}date to remember,'' he said.
   Three people rescued from a raft on 18-foot seas near
Charleston, S.C., were thankful to be alive as they ate
Thanksgiving Day dinner at the Coast Guard Air Station in Savannah,
Ga.
   The trio were tired but in good health after abandoning their
floundering 43-foot boat and drifting in a raft for four hours
Thursday about 35 miles southeast of Charleston, officials said.
   Elsewhere, the chiefs of Virginia's eight Indian tribes were the
guests of Gov. and Mrs. Gerald L. Baliles at a Thanksgiving feast
in Richmond.
   ``A lot of Indians in Virginia have probably wanted to do
something like this. I'd like to think that this is going to be
continued,'' said Chief Raymond Adams of the Upper Mattaponi tribe.

   A drug suspect and a sheriff's deputy
grappled with a knife during a harrowing two-mile ride in the
suspect's car, authorities said.
   Neither the suspect nor the deputy was seriously injured in the
fracas, which occurred about 65 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
However, the suspect was hurt later when he lost control of his car
and crashed, according to a Riverside County sheriff's spokesman,
Sgt. Jim Domino.
   Domino said the incident began Thursday afternoon when the
deputy, who was not identified, stopped a 1990 Ford Mustang and
discovered an undisclosed amount of methamphetamines inside.
   A struggle ensued and the driver, Ruben Danny Correa, 22, of
Whittier, allegedly started the car and drove off with the deputy
inside.
   Domino said Correa tried to stab the deputy, but the officer
wrested control of the knife. After two miles, the deputy got out
of the car and Correa drove off. The officer was only slightly
injured in the struggle.
   Correa lost control of his car about two hours later in the
Rancho California area, about 20 miles from the spot where he had
been pulled over by the deputy, Domino said.
   He was airlifted to Riverside General Hospital for treatment of
serious leg injuries. Domino said Correa would be booked for
investigation of drug possession and assault on a peace officer.

   A federal judge today threw out the
Iran-Contra prosecutor's criminal case against a former CIA station
chief who assisted Oliver North's secret Contra resupply operation.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton dismissed the case
against Joseph Fernandez, saying that Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh's affidavit barring disclosure of certain classified
information made it impossible to give Fernandez a fair trial.
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh said it would
appeal.
   The judge said that the information Thornburgh is blocking
concerning CIA facilities and programs in Central America is
essential for Fernandez ``to receive a fair trial.''
   Because of this, said the judge, ``the case will be dismissed.''
   Fernandez, the former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, was
charged with obstructing inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by
the CIA inspector general and the presidentially appointed Tower
Commission.
   Fernandez also was charged with two counts of making false
statements in connection with his activities on behalf of North's
network to arm the Nicaraguan rebels at a time when Congress had
banned military aid to the Contras.
   ``We are troubled by the actions of the intelligence agencies
and the attorney general, who have made bringing this case to trial
extremely difficult,'' associate independent counsel Laurence
Shtasel said.
   Hilton ruled last July that Fernandez must be able to disclose
at trial details about the locations of CIA stations in El Salvador
and Honduras, as well as details about CIA programs in Costa Rica.
   ``This is a significant Iran-Contra prosecution,'' Shtasel said.
``We will now appeal Judge Hilton's rulings ... making every effort
to bring the Fernandez case to trial.''
   Outside the courthouse, Fernandez said he was relieved that the
``freight train (prosecution) of the independent counsel'' is now
blocked.
   ``What troubles me'' about the independent counsel's case is
that ``the performance of legitimate duties'' by CIA officers
``could subject them to criminal prosecution,'' said Fernandez.
   He was asked whether he and his attorney, Thomas Wilson, had
engaged in graymail, the practice of trying to inject as much
classified information as possible into a prosecution in order to
torpedo the case.
   ``That is an onerous and unnecessary comment,'' replied
Fernandez. The former CIA station chief said he needed to present
such information in order to mount ``an adequate defense.''
   Wilson told the judge that the information Thornburgh was
barring from disclosure ``is the guts of the defense's case.''
   In court, Shtasel asked the judge to give the government until
next week to propose narrowing the charges against Fernandez so
that the classified information at stake in the case would not have
to be presented.
   The attorney general filed an affidavit on Wednesday barring
disclosure of the secrets and Shtasel said discussions have been
underway with the CIA since then in an attempt to balance the
national security concerns while preserving some of the criminal
charges.
   But Hilton refused to give the government more time, noting that
his rulings on what information Fernandez needs to use were issued
four months ago.
   This is the first time that an attorney general has filed an
affidavit barring disclosure of classified information in a
criminal case and that a judge has dismissed the charges because of
it.
   Walsh said that Thornburgh should have filed his affidavit last
July following Hilton's rulings. If that had been, said Walsh, ``a
proper appeal would have already been decided and the trial would
have been concluded.
   The independent counsel's office has called much of the
classified information that the government is protecting in the
Fernandez case ``fictional secrets'' that are already widely known
to the public.

   Discovery's crew worked through the
second full day of the shuttle's secret military space mission
Friday as officials on the ground kept a tight lid on what the five
astronauts were doing.
   They reportedly were conducting experiments for the ``Star
Wars'' missile defense system and other military projects. But
there was no official word from NASA or the Pentagon.
   The media was blocked from listening to space-to-ground
conversations, and communications between the astronauts and ground
controllers were encrypted in case someone figured out how to
eavesdrop.
   Mission Control in Houston broke the silence Thursday night to
report that Discovery would return to Earth on Sunday, landing at
7:02 p.m. PST at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. It will be the
third after-dark landing in 32 shuttle flights.
   The statement also reported, ``The crew is doing well and the
orbiter continues to perform satisfactorily.''
   Earlier, sources close to the project said the astronauts had
achieved the main goal of their mission by deploying a 2{-ton, $300
million satellite capable of monitoring military and diplomatic
communications in the Soviet Union, the Middle East, Africa and
Europe.
   There was no confirmation from the space agency or the Defense
Department on the release of the satellite.
   This is the fifth shuttle mission dedicated solely to military
research. The silence contrasts sharply with a non-military shuttle
flight during which the public can listen around-the-clock to
communications between the spacecraft and Mission Control, and NASA
broadcasts a running commentary on activities.
   Commanding Discovery's crew is Air Force Col. Frederick D.
Gregory. The others are Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot, and
three mission specialists: Navy Capt. Manley Carter Jr., F. Story
Musgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.

   The United Nations' refugee agency Friday
called on Hong Kong to investigate allegations that undue force was
used when moving Vietnamese boat people between detention centers.
   The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees has
protested the circumstances surrounding the Oct. 31 move of 48
Vietnamese, who are among the tens of thousands of boat people
seeking asylum in the British colony.
   Some of the moved Vietnamese reportedly claimed that security
forces used martial arts to immobilize them during the move from a
detention center to Phoenix House, a holding center for Vietnamese
who may be forcibly returned to their Communist homeland.
   The government denies that undue force was used.
   More than 50,000 Vietnamese who fled to Hong Kong by boat are
languishing in squalid camps throughout the territory. Most must
prove they fled political persecution to qualify for refugee status
or face mandatory repatriation.
   Tens of thousands of Vietnamese are expected to be denied
refugee status. Tension in the camps has increased recently with
the possibility of a program of forced repatriation.

<TEXT>
   In the past week, tens of
thousands of dedicated students have written a new chapter in the
650-year-old history of Wenceslas Square.
   The vast expanse in the center of Prague has been the scene of
medieval markets, colorful pageantry under Austrian imperial rule,
and religious ceremonies honoring Bohemia's patron saint, Prince
Wenceslas, murdered by heathen rebels more than a millennium ago.
   Wehrmacht soldiers lined it after the 1939 Nazi takeover,
workers rallied on it in support of the Communist putsch in 1948,
and in 1968 Soviet T-34 tanks parked on it following the Moscow-led
invasion that put a bitter end to the ``Prague Spring'' reform
movement of Alexander Dubcek, who was then ousted.
   Hundreds of students then used their knowledge of Russian for
nightly discussions with the tank crews, leaving them so
demoralized that some units had to be replaced.
   Official tourist guides make no mention of those days on the
square, nor do they include any reference to young Jan Palach, who
burned himself on the square to protest the end of ``socialism with
a human face.''
   After his death, hundreds of candles were set in front of the
statue of St. Wenceslas in the upper half of the 2,500-foot-long,
200-foot wide square. Palach has become a symbol of freedom and
Czechoslovak independence.
   On Friday, the square was the scene of Dubcek's triumphant
return to Prague, where he told 250,000 anti-government protesters
that ``the ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the
conditions of a new generation.''
   The square _ the social, cultural and shopping center of the
city _ is lined by shops, hotels, office and newspaper buildings,
most of them built in the late 19th century. It was known as the
Horse Market until 1848 because of its early importance as a site
for horse-trading.
   The upper end of the square is dominated by the National Museum.
   In addition to the statue of St. Wenceslas on horseback, the
square has statues of four other patron saints of Bohemia:
Ludmilla, Procopius, Agnes and Adalbert.
   Hundreds of candles also have reappeared in the square since
Nov. 17, when a peaceful rally in memory of a young student killed
by the Nazis 50 years ago was dispersed by baton-wielding police.
   It was that brutal repression that triggered the nationwide
pro-democracy demonstrations. ``It was the drop that made the keg
filled to the brim with discontent spill over,'' a non-Communist
Prague politician said.
   The rally gave life to a protest movement that took less than 72
hours to spread through the nation.

   Two brothers were executed and a third was
sentenced to life in prison for kidnapping and selling 51 women, it
was reported Friday.
   Wang Zhong and Wang Hong were executed Nov. 10 after being
convicted in the northern province of Shanxi of abducting women in
other provinces, the newspaper Legal Daily said.
   Two men in southwest China's Sichuan province were put to death
in September for heading a ring that kidnapped and sold 24 women,
including 22 who suffered mental disorders.
   The government, in its latest anti-crime campaign, has listed
the kidnapping of women and children as one of the ``six evils'' to
be combatted. The others are prostitution, pornography, drugs,
gambling and swindling people through superstition.
   The Legal Daily said kidnap gangs of up to 100 members are
operating in every Chinese province, with 90 percent of their
victims being peasant girls.
   The measures used to entice women include offers of jobs,
marriage and free travel. ``They use sweet words and talk of love
to seduce young women, and then kidnap and sell them. They kidnap
women who are dull-witted and suffer from nervous disorders. They
use violence to kidnap and sell women,'' the newspaper said.
   Many women are resold several times and raped, it said. In some
places, mostly remote rural regions, where women are bought, ``the
evil phenomenon of the taking of concubines and polygamy occurs.''
   An earlier report said that in coastal Shandong, China's
third-most populous province, more than 3,000 people have been
imprisoned in recent years for abducting and selling 30,000 women
and 1,000 children.

   A remote-controlled bomb exploded in
this frontier city Friday, killing three Palestinians returning
from an afternoon prayer service.
   Sheik Abdullah Al Assam and his two sons, Ebrahim, 23, and
Adnan, 15, reportedly were embroiled in Afghanistan's brutal
decade-old war, fighting on the side of anti-communist guerrillas,
police said. They had lived in Pakistan for 15 months.
   Al Assam recruited nationals from Arab countries to fight with
U.S.-backed guerrillas to protect their Moslem faith, police
sources said.
   The bomb, planted in a roadside ditch, was detonated when Al
Assam's car passed by, police said. No one has claimed
responsibility.
   In recent years, hundreds of bombs have exploded in Pakistan's
Northwest Frontier Province, where the majority of an estimated 3.5
million Afghan war refugees in Pakistan live. Another 2 million
refugees live in Iran.

   For Maros, a teacher in this
southern city, breaking the habits of 24 years of fear does not
come easily.
   He is thrilled with Czechoslovakia's democracy movement. But
like many people who have endured decades of hard-line Communist
rule, he knows he has a lot to lose.
   ``I want to be open and say what I feel. But it's not easy.
There's still something in me that says, `Maybe he'll give some
information to the secret police,''' says the young teacher,
jerking his chin at an imaginary informer.
   Sitting in a cafe sipping coffee, he explained in halting
English that he risks losing not only his job but the precious,
limited freedom he has carved out as a Roman Catholic. He asked his
surname not be used for fear of reprisal.
   Maros was at a friend's mountain cottage last weekend when
students in Prague launched Czechoslovakia's first big
anti-government protests in years. They heard about it on the Voice
of America, a U.S. government-funded radio station that broadcasts
into Eastern Europe.
   ``I haven't had such a feeling in my life,'' said the
short-haired teacher, clad in a blue plaid shirt, a gray sweatshirt
and carefully pressed blue jeans. ``In 1968, when such
demonstrations were allowed, I was 3 years old. It's something
new.''
   When he returned Monday to school in Bratislava,
Czechoslovakia's second-largest city, ``the situation was in
motion, also here.'' And he faced a difficult choice: should he
join?
   A key dilemma was whether to risk exposing himself as an
opponent of the Communist government, thereby jeopardizing the
secret meetings he had been organizing for years to teach children
about Catholicism.
   ``For 40 years children have grown up only in atheism. I think
it's a basic right of mothers and fathers to raise children as they
want,'' he said, describing with enthusiasm his lessons and field
trips with the children.
   ``On the one hand, the (political) situation is not good, but I
can do something secretly,'' he said. ``Or I could express my
opinion in work and risk that they have written my name down
somewhere and I will not be able to do this.''
   A similar dilemma arose for Maros in March 1988, when 2,000
Catholics demonstrated for religious freedom in Bratislava. Riot
police using water cannon broke up the protest and arrested 125
people.
   ``When there was this candlelight demonstration, there was a
great fight in the family, especially with Father. He didn't want
us to go because young people are willing to do such risky actions.
He said, `Do we keep our church alive for 40 years then risk it,
just to hold a candle?'''
   ``I was in my last year of university studies. They (officials)
said if students went they would be thrown out of school. If I
would be sent out, my parents would suffer and so would my work.''
   Maros decided not to go, but his two younger brothers did.
   ``I felt terrible. I went to an alternative place ... to pray,
to be in contact through prayer. When we heard the sirens _ `whee,
whee, whee' _ I knew my brothers were there for what we want _
freedom, our rights _ and I wasn't.
   ``I felt I had to run there and be beat up too.''
   New protests broke out in Bratislava on Monday, inspired by the
mass rallies in Prague calling for democracy and a new government.
   The next day, religious activists called for a demonstration
Wednesday outside a court in Bratislava where a Catholic dissident
was being tried on political charges.
   ``I wasn't initially sure about going. I have a job,'' Maros
said. But on Tuesday, Czechoslovakia's primate, Cardinal Frantisek
Tomasek, added his voice to the chorus demanding democracy, saying:
``At this decisive moment, no one must stand aside.''
   Maros left a note on his door at school Wednesday morning,
saying he would be back shortly. He didn't return.
   Sitting in the cafe Wednesday before attending Bratislava's
second protest rally of the day, he talked of the years he had
steeled himself to accepting only a little freedom in his life: the
secret meetings in which he taught children about God.
   ``Can you imagine you cannot phone a friend and say we will meet
tonight or tomorrow in the church? I am very afraid to phone
somebody that we will have a religious meeting and give an address
_ that is unthinkable.
   ``This is what is deep in us: such fear. ... We want this
freedom but we must learn it. It's deep in us, but we aren't yet
used to such a situation.''

   President Bush says the changes in Eastern
Europe raise the possibility of U.S. troop reductions abroad but
said no such cuts were imminent and none would be made unilaterally.
   ``There's a rapidity of change around the world, it's self
evident,'' Bush said in an interview with foreign journalists
Tuesday, a transcript of which was released by the White House
today.
   ``And I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same
levels of troops anywhere _ standing army, Europe, Korea, anywhere
else,'' Bush said. ``But we're certainly not going to take any
unilateral action.''
   The president responded ``No, not a bit'' when asked whether he
feared the changes in Europe and the Soviet Union would strip the
United States of its NATO leadership role.
   ``If tensions got so reduced that you didn't always worry about
U.S.-superpower confrontation or something, that would be a
marvelous world,'' he said. ``We ought to work toward that kind of
world. But it's got to be on our values. It's got to be on what we
in the United States think is best _ know is best.''
   Also today, the White House announced that Bush would meet with
President Francois Mitterrand of France on Dec. 16 in the
Caribbean, to discuss his meeting next week with Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev and a number of other issues. French officials
said the two leaders would meet on the island of St. Martin.
   In the interview with the foreign journalists, Bush tried anew
to dampen expectations for the meeting with Gorbachev, and
attributed his being labeled ``timid'' by some in Congress to
``pure gut American politics.''
   As for possible troop cuts, Bush said the administration was
``perfectly prepared to think anew, because we're living in
fascinating, changing times.''
   But he said he wanted first to await the outcome of ongoing
talks with the Soviets on conventional forces in Europe and also
would consult with NATO allies before considering any reductions in
U.S. troop levels.
   Bush, who will meet with Gorbachev two days next week aboard
U.S. and Soviet naval vessels off the coast of Malta, said he
looked forward to discussing the changes in Eastern Europe and a
wide-range of other topics with the Soviet leader.
   But to those who expect a major agreement on arms control or
other superpower differences to occur the president cautioned: ``It
isn't going to happen.''
   ``We're not looking forward to crossing `t's and and dotting
`i's at this meeting,'' Bush said. ``But, look, there is so much
rapid change going on in Eastern Europe that I am very anxious for
him, to hear from him what his thoughts are about the future of
Europe.''

<HEAD>Firms Vie For Removing Red Star From Parliament</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than a dozen firms have offered to
remove the Red Star from atop Hungary's sprawling neo-gothic
Parliament building, with many offering to do it for free, the
state MTI news agency said Friday.
   The government this year decided to gradually remove the red
star _ the symbol of Communist dominance _ from all public
buildings as part of Hungary's move toward democracy.
   The parliamentary office asked those interested companies to
submit bids by Nov. 20. Experts had estimated the cost of removing
the 3{-ton steel star at $66,000.
   Tibor Soos, the head of the parliamentary office in charge of
the project, was quoted by MTI as saying that 18 firms have
submitted bids for the contract. However, most of the bidders have
offered to remove the star from its 288-foot-high perch free of
charge, MTI said.
   MTI, in a dispatched titled, ``Red Star Wars,'' said the French
company Stal had offered to pay $63,000 to do the job in return for
owning the star. Hungarian officials have said, however, that they
want to display it at home.

   She is accused of supplying Saudi sheiks and
millionaire executives with call girls, some who later appeared in
the pages of Penthouse magazine or married into prominent families.
   Prosecutors contend even celebrities paid up to $2,000 a day for
the sex services. In exchange, the high-priced prostitutes lived a
jet-set life, following elite customers to Paris, London, Geneva,
New York and Las Vegas.
   When vice officers crashed her West Coast prostitution ring last
year, Elizabeth Adams at first denied she was a police informant.
Later, she recanted, saying she manned an inside pipeline for 16
years.
   ``Four of my girls married into very prominent families,'' Ms.
Adams once said, refusing to name names. ``They're so polished.
These people improved their lives thanks to me.''
   Detective Alan Vanderpool described her service as the best.
Vice Capt. James Docherty portrayed Ms. Adams as ``a multibuck,
big-time madam.''
   Ms. Adams began working with police in 1972 and relayed to them
information her call girls gleaned from their clients, she said in
court papers. Her lawyer said she should be shielded from
prosecution, or at least kept from incarceration, in exchange for
her work as an informant.
   Ms. Adams, 56, allegedly told police about people who were
involved in prostitution rings, along with firearms and narcotics
trade.
   Police allege a Saudi prince once ordered a ski companion for
his son through Ms. Adams. Most clients, however, were known only
by code name.
   A motion to dismiss the case of the Beverly Hills Madam is to be
heard Dec. 1 in Superior Court. Deputy District Attorney Alan
Carter said he is prepared to prosecute Ms. Adams on two felony
counts of pimping and pandering.
   The charges carry a maximum of seven years in prison.
   She became known as the Beverly Hills Madam because many people
alleged to be clients booked their trysts in posh Beverly Hills
hotel suites.
   Defense attorney Anthony P. Brooklier claims the case should be
dismissed because police encouraged Ms. Adams to continue her work
and provide the department with inside information garnered in her
``pillow talk network.''
   ``For some reason, when it's sack time, (men) make
revelations,'' she was quoted as saying last year by the Los
Angeles Times. The women ``hear things that the State Department
would give its eye teeth for.''
   Carter said in a recent interview he couldn't discuss the case.
   Ms. Adams, also known as Alex Fleming, was a police agent and
``officers should be bound by their promises that she would not be
prosecuted, or at a minimum, that the defendant not be
incarcerated,'' Brooklier argued.
   Ms. Adams, freed on $210,000 bail after being charged last year,
declined through Brooklier to be interviewed. And he refused to
disclose where she was living.
   In a declaration submitted to the court, Ms. Adams said she
started working with police in 1972 following her arrest on
pandering charges. For her cooperation, those charges were dropped.
   Deputy District Attorney Pamela Ferrero said last year that Ms.
Adams' police record included one felony conviction, one
misdemeanor guilty plea, fines and probation from four
prostitution-related arrests since 1972.
   Officials ``were well aware of my activities,'' Ms. Adams wrote
in court documents. She also said that because of her police
connections, she was severely beaten twice and required
hospitalization for her injuries.
   ``The information I provided led to the arrest and conviction of
numerous offenders over a 16-year period. In return, the law
enforcement officials have agreed to protect me against any
prosecution which would lead to incarceration for my activities,''
Ms. Adams told the court.
   Retired police Sgt. Glenn R. Souza stated in an affidavit that
Ms. Adams was identified in the 1970s as an agent for the
department by a U.S. Senate subcommittee.
   He corroborated Ms. Adams' statement about the beatings and said
she ``assisted detectives with information regarding numerous
felony cases in the areas of prostitution, firearms, narcotics and
other larcenous violations.''
   Souza said Ms. Adams assisted police from 1972 to 1982, but
Brooklier maintains the help continued until her arrest in 1988.
   Her enterprise unraveled when a former cook, Russell Lucas, went
to police, who sent in a young undercover policewoman to an
interview with Ms. Adams.
   ``It's just like going on a date but you get paid for it. You
never made money like this in your life,'' Ms. Adams told the
officer in a tape-recorded interview on Feb. 29, 1988. ``Get a
passport. Paris, Geneva, you get to see the world.''
   For fees of $150 an hour, Ms. Adams' employees would dine at
fine restaurants and take cruises to the Bahamas. She would keep
$400 of each $1,000 made, allegedly taking in about $100,000 a
month.
   Ms. Adams came from Manila 20 years ago. She worked as a florist
and antique shop owner. She said she was a mother and a widow when
she was approached by an ``English madam'' who offered her a client
book.

<HEAD>China Claims Most Joint Ventures Still Profitable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most foreign-invested joint ventures are
reporting profits despite skepticism and a cloudy business climate
after the bloody crackdown on political dissent in June, a
government news report said Friday.
   About 85 percent of the 8,000 Sino-foreign joint ventures that
have started operations have been profitable, Xinhua News Agency
said.
   ``If nobody makes a profit in China, how can we explain the fact
that the number of businesses with foreign capital is increasing
year by year, and many of them are expanding?'' Xinhua quoted Jing
Shuping, president of China International Economic Consultants, as
saying.
   In the first three quarters of this year, 4,281 joint ventures
were launched with a total contracted value of $4 billion, Xinhua
said.
   Since market-oriented economic reforms were begun 10 years ago,
China has approved 20,278 foreign-funded businesses, including
11,286 equity joint ventures, 7,712 contractual joint ventures and
1,230 firms wholly owned by foreign investors, the report said.
   They accounted for pledges of $32.2 billion by foreign investors
and paid-in foreign investment of $14.1 billion.
   The report quoted unnamed analysts as noting that low monthly
wages of $27, low taxes and a potential market of 1.1 billion
people are the main incentive for foreign investment in China.
   It cited the example of Yili-Nabisco Biscuit and Food Co., a
Sino-U.S. joint venture that makes Ritz crackers, which has
captured 70 percent of the biscuit market in Beijing and reached
this year's profit target in only six months.
   But uncertainties following the army's crackdown on the
student-led democracy movement led to an exodus of foreigners in
June, and sanctions imposed by Western governments have frozen
loans, equipment and technical exports, and certain kinds of
insurance for firms doing business in China.
   The government has launched a vigorous propaganda and financial
aid campaign to reassure investors and lure new business.
   ``After the May-June unrest in Beijing, many foreign investors
and business people became skeptical about Chinese political and
economic stability,'' Xinhua said. ``While some have gradually
overcome their concern after learning the true situation, others
are not sure how things really stand.''
   Many of the joint ventures, morever, are strapped for funds
under China's year-old austerity program, which cuts government
spending and credits to industry, and scrapped thousands of
construction projects and implementation of new economic reforms.
   ``Some enterprises are now facing problems, such as shortages of
ready cash, energy and raw materials,'' Xinhua said. ``Government
departments are helping to tide them over by granting new loans and
ensuring the supply of materials.''
   The Bank of China, the nation's foreign exchange bank, announced
this week that it will extend $108 million in loans to foreign
joint ventures because of the financial crunch.
   The bank had already supplied $946 million in Chinese currency
and an additional $800 million to foreign-invested firms this year.
The Bank of China is supporting 3,000 such enterprises with 10
different forms of loans to help them develop high-technology and
export-oriented goods.
   The People's Bank of China, the central bank, and the Industrial
and Commercial Bank also disclosed this week that they were
providing large-scale loans to the government to purchase cars from
faltering foreign-funded automakers, whose stocks are piling up
without buyers.
   They include Chrysler's Beijing Jeep and the French Peugeot
joint venture in Canton.
   Xinhua quoted Jing as claiming that stability of leadership and
support for the government are the basis for China's renewed
business stability.
   ``Despite the turmoil of a few months ago, life is back to
normal everywhere,'' Jing said. ``People are walking about as
relaxed as at any time before.''
   Anti-government and anti-Communist Party sentiment runs high,
however, and Beijing residents say privately they fear the
continuing investigations into the uprising and calls by
authorities to inform on fellow citizens who took part in the
protests.

   Men firing sawed-off shotguns riddled a

brothers linked to the Mafia, police said Friday.
   The women were killed Thursday night as they sat parked in a
Palermo neighborhood known as a Mafia stronghold.
   Investigators said the killings were clearly a part of a
continuing war between rival gangland factions.
   Police identified the victims as the mother, sister and aunt of

   Agostino Mannoia disappeared in April and is believed to have

   President Bush says he is ``prepared to think
anew'' about reducing U.S. troop levels abroad because of changes
in Eastern Europe but won't take action without the European allies.
   ``I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same levels
of troops anywhere _ standing army, Europe, Korea, anywhere else,''
Bush said in an interview with foreign journalists. ``But we're
certainly not going to take any unilateral action.
   ``We do what we do in conjunction with our allies,'' Bush said
in the Tuesday interview, a transcript of which was released Friday
by the White House. ``We'll be perfectly prepared to think anew,
always, because we're living in fascinating, changing times.''
   First, however, Bush said he wanted to await the outcome of
talks with the Soviets on conventional force levels in Europe, and
also Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's review of Pentagon budget
priorities.
   Bush, who is to meet for two days next week with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said he was ``not a bit'' worried
that the United States would lose its leadership role in the
Western alliance if the changes in Eastern Europe brought a
significant drop in superpower tensions.
   ``If tensions got so reduced that you didn't always worry about
U.S.-superpower confrontation or something, that would be a
marvelous world,'' he said. ``We ought to work toward that kind of
world. But it's got to be on our values. It's got to be on what we
in the United States think is best _ know is best.''
   Also Friday, the White House announced that Bush would meet with
President Francois Mitterrand of France on Dec. 16 in the
Caribbean, to discuss his meeting Gorbachev and a number of other
issues. French officials said the two leaders would meet on the
island of St. Martin.
   In the interview with the foreign journalists, Bush repeatedly
sought to dampen expectations for the meeting with Gorbachev, to be
held aboard U.S. and Soviet naval vessels off the coast of Malta.
   ``If you just get together and discuss change, that is my
definition of success,'' Bush said.
   ``We're not looking forward to crossing `t's' and dotting `i's'
at this meeting,'' Bush said.
   He said he believed the future of Europe, and the question of
possible German reunification, should be decided by the citizens of
each nation facing change.
   ``The role of the United States is to say: Here's what we think
is best _ democracy. Freedom. Free elections. Freedom of the press.
Freedom of worship. This is what we believe.''
   Some congressional Democrats have labeled Bush ``timid'' for not
taking a more active approach to the changes in Eastern Europe,
with some critics suggesting he visit the Berlin Wall, recently
opened by East Germany.
   ``Some have wanted me to go jump on top of the Berlin wall,'' he
said. ``Well, I never heard such a stupid idea. I mean, what good
would it do for an American president to be posturing while Germans
were flowing back and forth by the millions? It makes no sense at
all.''
   ``And that's one of the reasons we as the United States are
trying not to listen to those out there encouraging flamboyant
action, but to rather respond prudently, as a great power must, to
the change,'' he said.

<HEAD>Spotted Turtle Stopping Conrail Project In Its Tracks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The yellow-spotted turtle could fit in
the palm of your hand, and that's right where the creature has
Conrail and its plans to put a terminal at the turtle's wetlands
sanctuary.
   The 4-inch spotted turtle was once the most common turtle in
Massachusetts. Now the swamp-dweller is officially listed in
Massachusetts as a species of ``special concern.''
   Philadelphia-based Consolidated Rail Corp. has been stalled in
its tracks by concerns that seasonal vernal pools favored by the
spotted turtle could be damaged if Conrail goes ahead with plans to
expand its 1,000-car terminal facility off Route 495 to 2,600
spaces.
   The case is similar to the tussle in the 1970s over the snail
darter, a tiny fish that held up construction of a Tennessee dam
for a decade.
   In an attempt to soothe concerns of residents in this Boston
suburb and state environmentalists _ as well as addressing the
needs of the turtle _ Conrail has hired a pair of zoologists to
study the spotted turtle and its habits.
   The scientists will ultimately draft a plan for moving the
reptile to new accommodations nearby that would replicate their old
home.
   ``There is a legitimate concern about the environment in this
country,'' said Bruce Wilson, a senior vice president for legal
affairs at Conrail.
   ``I believe in the need to balance our concerns with preserving
the environment with the commercial demands that result from man
himself being a domesticated animal,'' Wilson said this week.
   The spotted turtle is far better off than the snail darter,
which was threatened with extinction by the dam.
   As a species of ``special concern'' in Massachusetts, it sits
two notches down from the ranks of those considered ``endangered.''
Wildlife of special concern are documented as being in decline and
facing a threat of disappearing from the state, said Tom French,
assistant director of the state Natural Heritage and Endangered
Species Program.
   The Conrail plan for the turtles must pass muster with French's
office, its first hurdle in the turtle case.
   Conrail began in 1987 to plan a proposed 27-acre project that
would include paving 21 acres adjacent to the Great Cedar Swamp, a
region designated by the state as one of critical environmental
concern.
   But it wasn't until April that environmental officials
discovered the turtles there.
   The terminal construction is expected to cost more than $20
million. The new expense of accommodating the turtles isn't known,
Wilson said.
   The turtles came as a surprise, said Wilson. But he insists the
railroad does not regard them as an obstacle.
   ``We went into this project with the attitude that we were going
to comply with whatever environmental laws were applicable to this
project,'' Wilson said. ``We have bent over backwards and assumed
that wherever we ran into a problem we would take the measures
appropriate. We're not going to run roughshod over the
environmental laws.''
   If the research and plan are satisfactory, the next steps are an
environmental impact report, and obtaining permits from the state
Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of
Engineers.
   But it is unlikely to be as easy as that. The fight has already
begun.
   The Westboro Conservation Commission approved the project. But
that was before the turtle problem turned up.
   Community activist Michael Hachey, an engineer, has joined in a
lawsuit seeking reconsideration of the commission's action.
   ``It's an ill-advised project with little benefit to the general
public,'' Hachey said.
   To build the facility, Conrail also needs a zoning variance, as
well as permission to pave portions of wetlands and replicate them
elsewhere on the property.
   It could be a long haul.
   ``A lot of people say, `Oh, its just a silly little turtle',''
said Hachey. ``But we don't regard it as a silly little turtle. And
if they (Conrail) are able to lawyer their way around this, it'll
be open season on state-listed rare species.''

   The U.S. Supreme Court could still make
significant changes in abortion law, despite the out-of-court
settlement of one of three key abortion-rights cases on its docket
this session.
   The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in cases
from Ohio and Minnesota, both of which focus on state laws
requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets
an abortion.
   Those cases _ and an Illinois dispute settled out of court
earlier this week _ were seen by those on both sides of the issue
as likely vehicles for the Supreme Court to expand or modify its
July ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion.
   The Illinois case, over state regulation of abortion clinics,
was the most likely of the three to result in changes to the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, said Jack Tunheim, chief deputy
attorney general for Minnesota. The Illinois case affected all
women, rather than just minors.
   ``I don't think the Illinois settlement will have any impact on
our case,'' Tunheim said Thursday. ``The Minnesota case and the
Ohio case both involve what we view as a very, very different
proposition _ the issue of minors' abortions.''
   The settlement announced by Illinois Attorney General Neil
Hartigan and officials of the Illinois American Civil Liberties
Union would resolve a legal challenge to regulations requiring
abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like hospital operating
rooms.
   In the case, Ragsdale vs. Turnock, Dr. Richard Ragsdale of
Rockford contended that the state regulations would make it much
more difficult and costly for women to obtain abortions.
   Despite federal court rulings that the law unconstitutionally
limited women's access to abortion, Illinois argued that the rules
were necessary to protect women's health.
   Although regulations would be eased substantially for early
abortions, tougher regulations would apply to clinics performing
the procedure after 18 weeks, when there is a greater likelihood of
a need for general anesthesia or the occurrence of complications,
Jay Miller, executive director of the ACLU of Illinois, said today.
   However, a requirement that has been stricken for all abortion
clinics, is a rule mandating that patients receive counseling from
someone about birth control and adoption, he said. The old rules
also required that the counselor must derive no profit from
abortion procedures.
   A pro-choice group, Fund for the Feminist Majority, says 91
percent of abortions on American women are performed before the
12th week, 8 percent in the second trimester and 1 percent in the
third.
   Anti-abortion activists wanted the Ragsdale case to go before
the Supreme Court because a favorable ruling would have made it
difficult for abortion clinics to operate, said Joseph Schiedler,
director of the national Pro-Life Action League.
   But either the Ohio or Minnesota case ``could still serve as a
catalyst for eroding Roe vs. Wade,'' he said.
   ``The court seems to be moving toward restricting abortions and
they can do it with the cases they have left,'' Schiedler said
Thursday.
   The Ragsdale settlement still must be approved by a U.S.
District Court judge in Chicago.
   Attorneys for anti-abortion groups will try to scuttle the
settlement in district court in hopes it could still go before the
Supreme Court, Schiedler said.
   Jay Miller, executive director of the ACLU in Illinois, said he
thought the Ragsdale settlement indicated the tide was turning
against efforts to undermine Roe vs. Wade.
   ``It's still a crap shoot, but I'm more optimistic,'' said
Miller, referring to the two abortion cases pending before the
Supreme Court.
   The key vote in the upcoming cases is expected to be cast by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Miller said.
   In July, hers was the fifth and decisive vote in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services, in which the court allowed states
greater leeway in regulating abortion. The ruling came on a
challenge to a Missouri law that, among other things, banned
abortions in public hospitals and clinics.
   The Bush administration is pressing the high court to use the
Ohio and Minnesota cases to go beyond the Missouri decision and
overturn Roe vs. Wade, which legalized abortion.
   Neither Minnesota nor Ohio are asking the Supreme Court to
overturn the pivotal ruling.
   The Ohio case stems from a 1985 state law that requires that at
least one parent be notified at least 24 hours before an unmarried
teen has an abortion.
   A challenge by an Akron abortion clinic on behalf of a teen-age
mother has been upheld by a federal appeals court.
   In the Minnesota case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th
Circuit upheld the state's law requiring notification of both
parents.
   The ACLU has filed a brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn
the Minnesota law on the grounds that the measure makes it more
difficult for teen-agers to obtain abortions.
   Both the Ohio and Minnesota laws permit teen-agers to bypass
this requirement by obtaining a confidential court ruling
authorizing the abortion without parental involvement.

<TEXT>
   Maurice Tempelsman, a wealthy New York diamond
merchant often seen at social events on the arm of Jacqueline
Kennedy-Onassis, is a major player behind the scenes of
African-American relations.
   Little known to the public at large _ his name doesn't even
appear in Who's Who _ Tempelsman has contacts across the continent
from when he started doing business more than three decades ago.
   The 60-year-old businessman is on a first-name basis with
Archbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa's anti-apartheid activist; is
called ``grand-pere'' by Gabon's President El Hadj Omar Bongo; and
entertains Zaire President Sese Seko Mobutu.
   Until recently, the balding, portly teddy bear of a man,
preferred to remain behind the scenes.
   In 1989, Tempelsman became the board chairman of the prestigious
African-American Institute, the country's oldest nonprofit
organization dedicated to improving relations between the
continents.
   In that capacity, he's delivered lectures and continued to
travel to Africa as often as every two months.
   As an astute businessman, Tempelsman has cultivated Africans on
all sides of the political spectrum. He recently set up an office
in mineral-rich Namibia in advance of November's elections, a
precursor to independence in the South Africa-run territory.
   Over the years, he's been criticized from the left because of
his ties to DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which mines diamonds
from South Africa, among other places, and for once hiring the
CIA's top Africa official when the man retired from the agency.
   The right recently questioned Tempelsman's dealings with
Soviet-backed Angola. Tempelsman said he has a ``commercial
relationship'' with that country's National Diamond Co. The Angolan
government is embroiled in civil war with U.S.-backed rebels led by
Jonas Savimbi.
   Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, a lobbying group,
also has suggested that Tempelsman may have had something to do
with Angola's contract to sell oil to Citizens Corp., a
Boston-based energy company started by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass.,
Mrs. Onassis' nephew.
   Tempelsman pooh-poohs these attacks as coming from a ``group of
zealots who look at things from a conspiratorial point of view.''
   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Africa
subcommittee, said Tempelsman frequently has attended the panel's
hearings.
   Tempelsman, who generally favors economic sanctions against
white-ruled South Africa, recently fought efforts to include uncut
diamonds in the sanctions bill, Wolpe said.
   With the help of his lawyer, Theodore Sorenson, former
speechwriter for the late President Kennedy, Tempelsman helped
persuade Wolpe and others that diamond sanctions would hurt
countries like Botswana more than South Africa because uncut
diamonds are not identified by their country of origin.
   A staunch Democrat, Tempelsman gives freely to the party as well
as to its political candidates.
   Nevertheless, he praised Reagan administration officials for
brokering a plan that led to elections in Namibia and an agreement
to withdraw Cuban troops from Angola.
   Tempelsman is the chief executive officer of Lazare Kaplan
International, a diamond-cutting concern, as well as a general
partner in Leon Tempelsman and Son Inc., an investment company with
interest in minerals, agriculture and industry.
   In a wide-ranging interview at his penthouse office overlooking
New York's Fifth Avenue, the Belgium-born Tempelsman reflected on
how his business interests merged with his appreciation for Africa,
and how he sees the future of the world's least-developed continent.
   His office, guarded by a tight security system, is tastefully
furnished with African art. All around are books and magazines
dealing with art, from Africa and the Greek and Roman periods.
   ``One is fortunate when career interests and philosophical
interests coincide,'' he said. ``It's always nicer to work at
something you like doing.''
   The Tempelsman family came to the United States around World War
II. But Tempelsman didn't get involved in Africa until business
took him to Ghana, the former Gold Coast, in the mid-1950s.
   Decolonization, which has taken place over the last three
decades, has been one of the ``more historical events in mankind's
history,'' Tempelsman said. ``I think Namibia is the last chapter.''
   While Tempelsman has prospered in part because of Africa's
minerals, some countries have seen their standards of living
decline and their people embroiled in endless civil wars.
   Describing nation-building as a ``risky adventure,'' Tempelsman
said, ``That continent is going through an agonizing period, mostly
economic, some self-inflicted, some subject to other factors.''
   To alleviate some countries' problems, Tempelsman favors action
from Washington to wipe out some of their debt as well as more aid.
   Generally, though, Tempelsman said foreigners can't dictate to
Africans how they should run their countries.
   ``It has to come from their own internal processes,'' he said.
``We can hector and condemn, but in the end both the benefits and
the fruit of political independence mean you have the right to make
your own mistakes.''

<HEAD>Plain English Campaign Cites `Practical Haplography'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Words ``fine'' and ``pendicularity'' in 3rd graf are cq.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fear of ``practical haplography'' earned a soccer
coach a Golden Bull award Friday from the Plain English Campaign.
   ``We've had some superb Bull entries this year,'' said Chrissie
Maher, director of the 10-year-old Plain English Campaign.
   ``The instructions for a toy plane said: `Check if tail fine is
complete pendicularity. Be in same length A to A.' And that was not
bad enough to win.''
   Colin Murphy, coach of the Lincoln City soccer team, was cited
for the impenetrability of ``Murph's Message'' in game programs.
   ``We cannot fall into the trap of committing practical
haplography,'' Murphy wrote. ``It is also a dangerous feeling to
consider that where we are in the league is of acceptable standard
because standard is relevant to the standards we have set, which
thereby may well indicate that we have not aspired to the standard
which we set ourselves.''
   Webster's New World Dictionary, Third College Edition, does not
define haplography, but Ms. Maher said it means accidentally
dropping a letter or syllable when writing a word.
   Murphy was also cited for this one: ``We must be the harbingers
and nothing less than this can be acceptable.''
   The other winners came from the usual ranks of bureaucrats and
offices, and only three showed up to collect. Murphy was among the
missing.
   Halifax Building Society won a Golden Bull for a letter which
explained: ``In answer to paragraph two of your letter, the
regulation 2(b) states that the provisions contained in the
Mortgage Conditions concerning insurance on the property will only
be enforced if the borrower contravenes or does not comply with the
Property Insurance Regulations.''
   The tax office in Aberdeen, Scotland, scored with this letter:
``I am sending you a copy of your new entry, your previous entry as
amended or notification of the deletion of your previous entry, as
the case may be, together with this notice in terms of section
15(5) of the Abolition of Domestic Rates Etc. (Scotland) Act 1987
(`the Act'), as amended by paragraph 24(4) of Schedule 12 to the
Local Government Finance Act 1988 (`the 1988 Act'). In order to
show what the amendment is, I am also sending (except in the case
of a new entry) a copy of your previous entry.''
   The campaign also presented awards for good English to two
government departments and the London borough of Hammersmith, all
past winners of Golden Bulls.
   There's nothing complicated about writing plain English, Ms.
Maher said, and she quoted Colin Murphy: ``If we continue to
perform certain acts correctly then the correctness will manifest
itself with correctability and we'll know then that correctitude
will result.''

   The Coast Guard searched Friday near Santa
Catalina Island for a third person who may have been with a couple
found floating dead amid the mysteriously demolished remains of
their boat.
   Two bodies were found Thursday afternoon and the search for a
third person began after relatives of the victims were contacted,
said Petty Officer Dennis Ramirez.
   Investigators could not say whether the cabin cruiser Lucky R
was destroyed in a collision or by explosion. However, there was no
sign of fire and the bodies were not burned, Ramirez said.
   ``There were thousands of little pieces of wreckage out there,''
said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Lt. Paul McIlroy. ``It looked
like someone had picked it up, chewed it up and spit it out.''
   The victims were not wearing life jackets and there was no
distress call.
   A person aboard a charter boat saw the bodies and issued a
distress call.
   The couple was identified as Robert Reid, 84, and his wife,
Thelma, 75, of Hemet, said coroner's investigator Debrah Kitchings.

<HEAD>Communists Shift Blame for Current Crisis on Past Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Egon Krenz conceded Friday
his Communist Party's hard-line policies had plunged the nation
into crisis.
   Labor leaders, meanwhile, called for an investigation of another
disgraced Communist.
   Also on Friday, a third weekend of frenzied shopping and
sightseeing began for East Germans, as tens of thousands started
streaming into West Germany and West Berlin.
   In its public statements, the Communist Party appeared to be
trying to show that past leaders _ and not Krenz and his new
government _ are responsible for repression and economic stagnation
in East Germany.
   Krenz told the Communist Party daily Neues Deutschland that he
agrees with reformists' calls for an end to his party's guaranteed
``leading role.''
   Demands for abolition of the constitutional mandate for
Communist Party rule have spread from pro-reform citizens groups to
the ruling circle, as the current leaders struggle to divorce
themselves from the policies of the past.
   But Krenz and other senior party and government officials were
closely associated with ousted leader Erich Honecker. The
association has robbed them of public gratitude for the popular
reforms such as relaxed censorship and freedom to travel.
   In the battle to boost living standards and the leaders'
credibility, party officials have launched investigations into
alleged misuse of office by Honecker and his top lieutenants. They
have also joined the chorus of calls for sharing power.
   Krenz was asked during the Neues Deutschland interview about
pro-democracy activists's attacks on Article 1, the constitutional
mandate for Communist control.
   ``We are in favor of abolishing it,'' he replied.
   He said a party's success ``is not put forth through laws or
declarations, but can only result from work, performance and its
attitude.''
   Krenz responded to widespread accusations of Communists' abuse
of office by saying, ``We are not a corrupt party.''
   But he conceded the Communists were responsible for ``many basic
mistakes, ultimately the crisis of our society.''
   Leaders of the government-run labor union Friday asked for an
investigation of Harry Tisch, an ousted Politburo member and the
former government labor chief, for alleged abuse of power.
   On Thursday, the embattled party announced it had opened an
investigation into alleged wrongdoing by Honecker and expelled the
former economy chief from the party.
   Krenz's close association with Honecker's rule has fueled
speculation that he may lose the party leadership at a special
congress to be held Dec. 15-17.
   Since Nov. 9, when East Germany's travel rules were rescinded,
more than 6 million have visited West Germany, mostly on the
weekends.
   The vast majority have returned to their homes and jobs in East
Germany, but West German officials reported a trend toward more
resettlers.
   Nearly 2,000 East Germans asked to stay in the 24 hours prior to
Friday morning, compared with 865 during the previous day.
   In an interview with the newspaper Tribuene, East Germany's new
minister for finance and prices conceded that the long-demanded
one-to-one exchange rate for East German marks with West German
marks is unrealistic.
   The minister, Uta Nickel, said a true rate of exchange could be
4.4 East German marks to each West German mark, which is still less
than half the unofficial rate set by traders in the West.
   East Germany has rejected immediate setting of a conversion rate
in fear that the subsequent price rises would be too harsh for
those with fixed incomes to bear.
   But the lack of legal means to convert East marks for Western
shopping trips has unleashed rampant black-market trading.
   Guenter Hartmann, head of the National Democratic Party allied
with the ruling Communists, was quoted by the West German newspaper
Bild as saying East Germany plans to devote at least $1.62 billion
in hard currency to a travel fund for East Germans.
   Bild also quoted Hartmann as proposing a council to handle
affairs of concern to both nations, but said he called on Bonn to
guarantee the existence of a separate East German state.
   West Germany has been hesitant to enter into treaties and
contractual agreements that are tantamount to full recognition of
East German statehood. The West German constitution embraces a goal
of eventual reunification.
   Hartmann was quoted by Bild as saying that a single German state
was not excluded from possibility in the ``distant future,'' but
that it is not open for discussion at present.
   Also Friday, Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky visited East
Berlin and signed a wide-ranging agreement on economic cooperation.
East Germany says it will encourage greater business cooperation as
part of the effort to stabilize the economy.

   Communist Party chief Nicolae
Ceausescu, the East bloc's longest-reigning leader, was reappointed
Friday in a lavish show of support for his rejection of reforms
washing over his Communist neighbors.
   Delegates to the 14th Communist Party Congress cheered and
clapped rhythmically in a repetition of the staged displays of
adulation for their hard-line leader that have marked the congress
since it opened Monday.
   Ceausescu, 71, told delegates he has no plans to step down from
the post he has held for 24 years. His new term is for five years.
   ``I would like to assure the congress, the people and the nation
that in the future I will continue to be a soldier fighting for
socialism and Romania,'' he declared, his voice rising to a near
scream.
   ``Romania has achieved a number of victories in its 1,000-year
history, but none so great as the building of a new socialist
society,'' said Ceausescu, who is called the ``conducator,'' or
supreme leader.
   As he spoke inside downtown Palace Hall, parade marshals and
police positioned phalanxes of workers, youth group members and the
paramilitary people's guard in preparation for his appearance.
   State radio later said about 125,000 people turned out. The
square before the Central Committee building was full, with the
crowds spilling into side streets.
   In his keynote speech Monday, Ceausescu condemned the whirlwind
of democratization changing the systems of the formerly rigid
Warsaw pact nations. But he refrained from that theme in his
one-hour speech Friday.
   He lauded the role of ``the working class ... in doing away with
the outmoded system of bourgeois democracy.''
   His wife, Elena, sat on Ceausescu's right on a stage reserved
for ranking officials and foreign dignitaries. She gazed stolidly
at the crowd below, in a scene reminiscent of Soviet bloc party
congresses of the Stalinist era.
   Even before the onset of liberalization in the rest of the
Soviet bloc, Ceausescu had been considered among the most hard-line
Communist leaders, with his country's human rights record a
frequent target of criticism abroad.
   An opening-day boycott of most of the 16-member NATO alliance
was later expanded, with Switzerland, Austria and most Latin
American democracies breaking with past practice and keeping their
heads of diplomatic missions away from the congress in protest.
   Strong suppression of any opposition to Ceausescu's rule has
generated a general climate of oppression, contributing to the
problems of a population that has suffered through years of food
and energy shortages, idling cars and keeping homes unheated during
the winter.
   His government's program of razing ethnic Hungarian villages in
Romania has led to his condemnation by human rights groups.
   Ceausescu's steel grip on the party and on society has resulted
in the development of a personality cult unequalled since the
1950s, when the Soviet Union feard and feted Stalin, and its
satellites their own leaders.
   Slogans of love and admiration sounded for Ceausescu within the
congress hall were repeated by the masses later, as Ceausescu
addressed them from the main balcony of the party headquarters,
draped with a red-and-white slogan proclaiming ``Ceausescu,
Romania, Freedom.''
   ``The whole activity of our party will be dedicated to building
communism ... and safeguarding the independence and sovereignty of
Romania,'' he declared.
   The congress theoretically had the power to reject Ceausescu,
but his continued role as leader had been a foregone conclusion,
with officials rolling their eyes when asked if he would be
opposed. He was the only official candidate.
   Ceausescu was elected by the newly chosen 467-member Central
Committee of old and new Ceausescu stalwarts, who in turn had been
chosen by the delgates. The Central Committee also picked a
47-member Executive Political Committee, or politburo.
   Delegates also gave rubber-stamp approval to an economic program
``for the next five years and beyond'' foreseeing a strengthened
role for the Communist Party in daily affairs.
   Ceausescu called for the annulment of the 1939 Soviet-Nazi
Germany treaty that agreed to the partition of much of Eastern
Europe among the powers. One secret provision of the treaty ceded
the Romanian province of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union and gave
Moscow control over the Baltic states.

   Communist Party chief Milos Jakes
and the rest of the Communist leadership resigned today after more
than a week of huge protests of their hard-line policies, state-run
media said.
   The resignations were offered at a closed-door, emergency
session of the party Central Committee, which was expected to
approve them.
   They came after Jakes, 67, admitted that the party had not
instituted reforms quickly enough and had seriously underestimated
the effect of the pro-democracy movement sweeping Eastern Europe.
   He was the third East bloc leader to fall from power in a little
more than a month as support for the reforms instituted by Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev gains momentum.
   As the party met, hundreds of thousands of people in downtown
Prague cheered Alexander Dubcek, the former party chief whose
attempts to institute reforms in 1968 were brutally crushed by a
Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Jakes was responsible for the purge of Dubcek and a half-million
other reformers from the Communist Party after the invasion. He
took over as Communist Party chief in December 1987.
   In its terse dispatch, the state-run new agency CTK, announced:
   ``The general secretary of the Czechoslovak Communist Party,
Milos Jakes, and all other members of the (ruling) Politburo and
Secretariat submitted their resignations so that a new leadership
of the party could be elected. Jakes said he hoped the newly
elected organs of the party will contribute to a more resolute
implementation of the process of restructuring and democratization.
   ``During the evening session, proposals for personnel changes
will be considered and a new leadership will be elected by secret
ballot,'' CTK said.
   The dispatch said 30 more people were still due to speak at the
meeting so it was not clear when the new leadership might be named.
   Shortly before the announcement, Dubcek made a triumphant return
to Prague, speaking in public in the capital for the first time
since his ouster.
   ``Dubcek, Dubcek!'' and ``Long Live Dubcek!'' a crowd of 250,000
yelled as the former leader appeared at Prague's central Wenceslas
Square, the site of repeated pro-democracy demonstrations.
   ``The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the
conditions of a new generation,'' Dubcek told the crowd.
   ``We must unify to raise our country to a higher level,'' he
declared in a five-minute speech.
   ``An old wise man said, `If there once was light, why should
there be darkness again?' Let us act in such a way to bring the
light back again,'' he said.
   Dubcek appealed to police, militia and the army ``to stand by
the people's side,'' and not to destroy the search for democracy.
   ``Do not act against the people. Remember, you are from the
people,'' Dubcek said. He also warned demonstrators to ``avoid
extremist trends.''
   Every day for a week, thousands of people have turned out for
pro-democracy protests in Czechoslovakia.
   They had demanded the resignation of Jakes, President Gustav
Husak and other leaders associated with the hard-line policies
pursued since Warsaw Pact tanks snuffed out Dubcek's reform.
   The protests began after police on Nov. 17 brutally crushed a
peaceful demonstration in Prague. For the past week, Jakes had
denounced the protesters as anti-socialists, but today, as he
opened his last Communist Party meeting, he admitted his Politburo
had made serious mistakes.
   ``For a week, our capital lives in a feverish atmosphere
accompanied by large demonstrations,'' the official CTK quoted
Jakes as saying. ``The tension is gradually spreading to other
places in the republic. We must openly say that our country is at a
fatal crossroads.''
   ``We have underestimated completely the processes taking place
in Poland, Hungary and especially recently in East Germany and
their effect and influence on our society,'' said Jakes.
   East Germany has instituted reforms, including opening its
borders and carving holes in the Berlin Wall, since long-time
leader Erich Honecker was ousted amid nationwide unrest on Oct. 18.
   This month, another Communist hard-liner, Todor Zhivkov of
Bulgaria, also lost his position. And Poland led the way by
installing the first non-Communist-led government in the East bloc.
   The lone holdout among Warsaw Pact leaders now appears to be
Nicolae Ceausescu of Romania, who has staunchly opposed democratic
reforms. He was re-elected to another five-year term today.

   Hundreds of people lined up early
to buy a 5-cent copy of Prague's Svobodne Slovo newspaper, but even
the 50,000 extra copies printed failed to satisfy demand for the
new champion of press freedom.
   Since Monday, the 45-year-old newspaper has lived up to its name
_ Free Word _ and has become a key voice for democratic change in
the reform movement sweeping the country.
   That's when its front page condemned a brutal police attack on
thousands of students assembled for a peaceful rally on Wenceslas
Square not far from its editorial offices.
   The newspaper brought a roar of applause from nearly 200,000
pro-democracy marchers who chanted the newspaper's name when they
marched past its building. Circulation shot up 20 percent and it
has been selling out by midday.
   ``It was a heart-warming experience,'' said deputy foreign
editor Adam Cerny.
   ``I am very proud,'' Karel Volesky, head of the newspaper's book
department, told a reporter. ``We were the first to supply free
information.''
   Editors have been busy over battered typewriters, the offices
have not seen a painter for decades, and metal tubes containing
copy rattle down to the printshop through the pneumatic dispatch
system, causing a noise as if the walls were caving in.
   ``It's a museum,'' Cerny said with a smile. ``The printing
presses date to 1936.''
   Since Tuesday, Svobodne Slovo also has made available a
third-floor balcony of its building as a rostrum for the speakers
addressing the giant rallies pressing for changes in the nation's
leadership every afternoon.
   Officially, Svobodne Slovo is the newspaper of the Socialist
Party, an ally of the ruling Communist Party.
   But it departed months ago from the staid fellow-traveler line
that has made Czechoslovak readers buy newspapers chiefly to read
the sports page, crossword puzzles or ads.
   Monday's issue, however, made the paper a real thorn in the
flesh of hard-line Communists.
   ``We have information that conservatives are sabotaging the
distribution to places outside Prague,'' Volesky said. ``Packages
with newspapers were removed from trains. But now students help us.
They drive out in their cars with the newspapers.''
   ``I am very proud,'' he repeated.

   Two Pitkin County commissioners can't tear
down the increasing numbers of large, expensive buildings that
annoy them. But they can poke fun, so they're holding the ``First
Annual Really Bad Architectual Award.''
   The winner won't be the architect but the person who most
accurately describes why the building in question is offensive.
   ``We reserve the right to impose our standards of taste,'' said
Wayne Ethridge, a land planner, who is sponsoring the contest with
Herschell Ross.
   The contest rules allow for anonymous entries in order to
encourage architects and designers to take shots at their
colleagues. The deadline for postmarking entries is Dec. 15.
   ``The decision of the judges is final, but not as permanent as
bad architecture,'' the rules state, ``There is no need to be
present to win, since you probably can't afford to live here.''
   One turkey apiece will be awarded to winners in the residential
and commercial categories. Two turkeys will be donated to feeding
the hungry on behalf of the best anonymous entries.

   Dan Hecht says he doesn't mind puckering
up to a pig for charity as long as the porker is pretty and female.
   Hecht gave the pig a peck on the snout at a discount store as
shoppers looked on, claiming his prize in a contest organized by
the American Diabetes Association chapter in Effingham.
   A veteran pig busser, Hecht said he kissed his first hog several
years ago at a fund-raiser for another charity.
   ``The farmer that raises the pig asked me how I liked it and I
told him I didn't really care for it,'' said Hecht, who owns a car
dealership.
   ``He said, `Well, you picked the ugliest one in the bunch,''' he
recalled, laughing. ``This year, I picked out a good-looking one.''
   Residents of this south-central Illinois community of 11,000
picked Hecht over six area notables for Wednesday's honor. Voters
dropped money in canisters marked with contestants' names, said
organizer Jane Zuber.
   Contestant Kathryn Kelly, city editor of the Effingham Daily
News, said she was glad Hecht won.
   Kelly said she didn't indulge in any vote-rigging, though there
were rumors that some contestants had put money in competitors'
canisters.
   ``I had also heard that employees from Dan Hecht's were going
down there and putting money in his canister,'' she said.
   The contest raised $260 for diabetes education for the estimated
1,500 diabetes sufferers in Effingham County. Some of the money
also will go to the national association for research on a cure for
diabetes, Zuber said.

<DATELINE>CHTOURA, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today elected Elias Hrawi, a
Maronite Catholic legislator, to be the new president to replace
Rene Mouawad, who was assassinated after only 17 days in office.
   The election of Hrawi, 59, a wealthy agricultural engineer, was
expected to advance efforts to form a national unity government
that would introduce political reforms aimed at ending Lebanon's
brutal 14-year-old civil war.
   But that effort will be opposed by the Christian army commander,
Gen. Michel Aoun, who condemns the peace plan brokered by the Arab
League because it fails to say when Syria's 40,000 troops will be
withdrawn from Lebanon.
   After being elected by lawmakers meeting under tight security in
a hotel at this market town east of Beirut and sworn in by Speaker
Hussein Husseini as Lebanon's 10th president, Hrawi made an
acceptance speech. In it, he pledged to ``adhere to the Taif accord
and work for peace'' in Lebanon.
   He referred to the peace plan worked out by Lebanese legislators
last month in the Saudi Arabia resort of Taif with the aim of
ending the civil war.
   ``I promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred
President Mouawad had planned for national unity,'' Hrawi said. The
lawmakers applauded.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad sent a telegram to Hrawi saying,
``I see in your election an honor to the soul of the late President
Mouawad, who was determined to end Lebanon's torment.''
   There was no immediate response from Aoun, who has denounced the
Taif accord and the earlier election of Mouawad as unconstitutional.
   Husseini, announcing the election to reporters, said Hrawi was
elected by 47 votes in the second round of balloting. Five blank
ballots were found and one deputy abstained. In the first round of
balloting, Hrawi got 46 votes, two less than the two-thirds
majority of 48 votes required by the Constitution.
   Earlier today, state television reported erroneously that Hrawi
was elected by a unanimous vote of 53 of his fellow
parliamentarians.
   Hrawi, who has represented the Zahleh region in Parliament since
1972, maintains good contacts with the nation's Moslems as well as
neighboring Syria.
   His election was announced just 20 minutes after the
parliamentary session started at the Park Hotel in Chtoura, 23
miles east of Beirut.
   The legislators mustered the needed quorum for a session after
14 deputies traveling from various parts of Lebanon as well as
Paris and Geneva arrived at the hotel, raising the number present
to 53, five more than required.
   ``Lebanon again elected a head of state. The nation is
determined to survive in defiance of President Mouawad's
assassins,'' the announcer on state-run Channel 7 said.
   Voice of the Nation, a Moslem radio station, said the new
president would ``announce the formation of a national
reconciliation government and appoint a new commander of the
army.'' The report could not be officially confirmed.
   Mouawad was elected in Syrian-policed northern Lebanon on Nov.
5, after Aoun threatened to shell the Parliament building in Beirut
if legislators convened there.
   Aoun opposed the election of the Syrian-backed Mouawad and
called him a puppet of the Syrian government, which has 40,000
troops in Lebanon.
   The body of Mouawad was flown to his hometown of Zhorta in north
Lebanon today. He was to be buried Saturday.
   Mouawad, 64, a Maronite Catholic, and 23 other people were
killed in a remote-controlled roadside bomb explosion in Moslem
west Beirut on Wednesday.
   All Lebanese presidents have been Maronite Christians since the
country became independent from France in 1943. Under terms of an
unwritten covenant, the president is Maronite, the prime minister
Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.
   The bodies of Mouawad and six bodyguards killed with him were
driven in four ambulances from the morgue of the American
University Hospital today to a seaside apartment that he had turned
into a temporary residence in west Beirut.
   The coffins were draped with the Lebanese flag. Mouawad's widow,
Nayla, and his children, Rima and Michel, wept as they joined the
convoy outside the apartment building in Ramlet al-Baida and headed
for the airport for the flight north.
   A Middle East Airlines Boeing 707 carried the bodies and
Mouawad's family to the Kleiat air base in north Lebanon.
   Mouawad's election had ended 14 months of political vacuum after
former president Amin Gemayel's term expired with Parliment unable
to gather the necessary quorum for an election session.
   The political turmoil triggered one of the country's bloodiest
rounds of violence, pitting the Christian army troops of Aoun
against Syrian and Lebanese Moslem forces. Arab League intervention
halted the fighting Sept. 22.
   The Arab League later brokered a Christian-Moslem peace pact
which Mouawad was supposed to implement to end 14 years of civil
war. He was trying to form a government of national reconciliation
when he was killed.

   Polish Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki assured
the Soviet Union on Friday it could count on the solid partnership
of the East bloc's only non-communist-led government, but said
Poland wants to close deep historic wounds.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev warmly greeted the former
Solidarity editor and said that relations with Poland were
improving.
   The election of Mazowiecki on Aug. 24 ended more than 40 years
of Communist rule in Poland. He saluted Gorbachev's policy of
perestroika, and ``our and your freedom and solidarity.''
   ``The changes which are taking place in our country do not alter
the international obligations of Poland and nobody should see in
them a threat. On the contrary, they contribute to the stability of
Europe and strengthen us as a reliable and solid partner,'' he said.
   But speaking at a Kremlin dinner after his first day of talks
with the Soviet leadership, Mazowiecki raised the painful issue of
the massacre of Polish officers in the Katyn forest during World
War II, which still hinders real reconciliation between Poles and
Soviet.
   ``For Poles, the Katyn crime remains a wound which has not
healed,'' Mazowiecki said. ``We want to close all difficult
chapters of history. This is not only a matter for our alliance,
but for a real reconciliation of our peoples which is necessary for
us and for you.''
   More than 4,300 Polish officers were slain in the Katyn forest
near Smolensk in the Soviet Union. Moscow maintains the men were
murdered by the Nazis in 1941, while most Poles and Western
historicans believe the Soviet secret police murdered them in 1940.
   Katyn was one of the issues that Mazowiecki discussed when he
met Gorbachev for the first time Friday, his spokeswoman said.
   Gorbachev said greater contact would further improve relations
with his government.
   ``Maybe somebody would be surprised that I want to wish you
success,'' Gorbachev told Mazowiecki. ``We are no less interested
that your government and your nation _ has success.''
   ``We, too, are very interested in the success of perestroika,''
replied Mazowiecki through a translator, referring to Gorbachev's
program of political and economic restructuring.
   Gorbachev spoke to a group of reporters in his Kremlin office
before receiving Mazowiecki.
   ``If you look back on our history, what is going on between our
two countries is that there are new relations. I am sure this is
for our mutual benefit,'' Gorbachev said. ``Relations between our
peoples have changed for the better.''
   Mazowiecki, who spent over a year in jail after the 1981
martial-law crackdown, appeared relaxed despite the tight security
and strict protocol.
   Poles held the Soviets responsible for the installation of a
Communist regime after World War II but have welcomed perestroika
and Gorbachev's policy of not interfering with democratic reforms
under way in Eastern Europe.
   Polish government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska said
later the meeting lasted nearly two hours. ``The prime minister is
very, very satisfied with these talks,'' she said. ``They were
very, very open, wide and friendly.''
   She quoted Mazowiecki as saying that Gorbachev is ``very
interested in and knows a lot about Poland and approaches the
country with understanding.''
   Niezabitowska said both sides also discussed economic issues,
the dramatic changes in East Germany, and the U.S.-Soviet summit.
She gave no details.
   Tass said Gorbachev had expressed concern about a revanchist
mood in connection with the events in East Germany. Both Poland and
the Soviet Union have suffered from German aggression and appear
concerned about the re-emergence of a unified Germany.
   Gorbachev's upcoming meeting with Pope John Paul II, an old
friend of Mazowiecki's from his days as editor-in-chief of a
Catholic weekly, also was discussed, she said. Mazowiecki, a Roman
Catholic, chose to make his first foreign trip to Rome to meet the
pope rather than to Moscow as was required of his Communist
predecessors.
   He also discussed Poland's debt to the Soviet Union and the
issue of Soviet oil and natural gas deliveries with Soviet Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Niezabitowska said. The Polish side asked for
an increase in gas deliveries and Ryzhkov pledged to honor its
agreements with Poland, she said.
   Poland would like the Soviet Union to ease repayment terms of
its $1.5 billion hard-currency debt to the Soviet Union and is
seeking to have future trade calculated on the basis of world
prices.
   The Soviet Union accounts for one-third of Poland's foreign
trade and working groups have been set up to work out ways to
restructure economic relations.
   The new government has developed a market-oriented economic
reform program and starting next year, Niezabitowska said that up
to 15 percent of all exchanges would be on an experimental basis.

<HEAD>Kaifu Pledges Reforms as Recruit Trial Begins</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu promised to ``work
harder'' for political reforms Friday, the same day the first trial
opened in a bribery scandal that toppled a predecessor and still
shakes Japanese politics.
   Two defendants denied bribery charges related to an alleged
influence-peddling scandal involving officials and the Recruit Co.,
an information and publishing conglomerate.
   Kaifu told reporters the Recruit affair was ``an incident that
should never be repeated. I think we have to work even harder on
political reforms.''
   Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor, and Masao
Tatsumi, a former Recruit executive, pleaded innocent as their
trials opened in Tokyo District Court.
   Kato, 59, who was in a position to supervise Recruit's lucrative
publishing business, was charged with receiving a bribe in the form
of discounted shares in a Recruit subsidiary.
   The prosecution alleges Kato influenced Labor Ministry
regulations to benefit Recruit's booming business.
   But Kato, while acknowledging the purchase of shares, said he
was not aware of a bribery intent behind the stock deal and denied
doing any favors for the company.
   ``Because of a lack of discretion, I have considerably damaged
the credibility of the labor administration and caused trouble for
the government and the court, and I deeply regret it,'' Kato told
the court.
   ``But all the measures I have taken in the labor administration
were, I believed, most suitable and I have never treated a specific
company with a special favor,'' he said.
   Tatsumi, 47, who allegedly played an intermediary role between
Kato and Recruit's founder, Hiromasa Ezoe, said he has no part in
the bargain stock deal.
   ``I have never discussed the stock deal with Mr. Kato and Mr.
Ezoe, and I have no knowledge about the details of the stock deal
with Mr. Kato,'' Tatsumi said.
   Ezoe will be tried Dec. 15 on seven counts of bribery. Four
other trials are starting before Dec. 15 for two leading
politicians, six bureaucrats and four executives of the Recruit
Co., which is accused of trying to win favors and influence by
showering huge donations and stock deals.
   In charging Kato, Tatsumi and others involved in the stock deal,
prosecutors referred to a 1988 Supreme Court decision suggesting
that trading stocks certain to rise in value and difficult for the
general public to obtain could amount to bribery.
   Kato said in his defense he had no knowledge that the shares
were certain to rise in value or that the public would not be able
to obtain them. He also said he was not aware the stock prices were
set at artificially low levels, as alleged.
   The trial is to resume Dec. 26.
   Defendants in later trials include Ezoe and Takao Fujinami, a
former chief Cabinet secretary.
   The Recruit scandal has shaken the foundation of Japanese
politics since it erupted last summer. It forced Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita from office and has been blamed for the governing
Liberal Democrats' setback in July elections for the upper house of
Parliament.
   In a desperate attempt to leave the scandal behind, the Liberal
Democrats selected the relatively young Kaifu as premier in August.
   Kaifu reiterated Friday that his party is following new
guidelines curbing political donations from corporations.
   The party is considering whether to call elections for the more
powerful lower house early next year.

<HEAD>Attorney: Death Brought Killer's Split Personalities Together</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors tried for five years to fuse the 10
personalities of Ross Carlson so he could stand trial for the
murder of his parents. His attorney believes death succeeded where
the doctors failed.
   ``I think death was the final solution that caused the fusion of
the personalities, which the state hospital refused to do,'' said
Walter Gerash, who represented Carlson throughout the case.
   Carlson died Thursday at University Hospital of complications
from leukemia. He was 19 when the crimes were committed, and 25
when he died.
   He was charged with the Aug. 18, 1983, killings of his parents,
Rod and Marilyn Carlson, whose bodies were found beside an isolated
road in Douglas County, just south of Denver. They were found face
down, shot to death.
   He was arrested and charged with the deaths. He pleaded innocent
by reason of insanity and a psychiatrist said he thought the
teen-ager was suffering from multiple-personality disorder.
   Therapists eventually said they identified as many as 10
personalities and Carlson spent five years in the Colorado State
Hospital in Pueblo.
   But Gerash said, ``They hired debunkers instead people who know
how to treat the disorder.''
   Gerash said he had hoped therapy would ``fuse'' Carlson's
personalities, making him well enough to stand trial.
   Carolyn Herzberger, a spokesman for Colorado State Hospital,
refused to comment Friday on the case. ``Anything we did in an
attempt to fuse his personalities is privileged information about a
patient, and no hospital in the country is going to discuss that,''
she said.
   Only last month, Douglas County Senior Judge Robert Kingsley
ruled that Carlson was competent to stand trial, and one was
scheduled next month.
   Kingsley said he thought Carlson's personalities were simply a
good acting job.
   Just days after the competency ruling, Carlson was rushed to the
hospital after a vomiting spell. On Nov. 7, doctors confirmed a
diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
   Carlson initially refused chemotherapy because his wrists were
shackled. Gerash said some of his personalities felt threatened by
the restraints. The shackles were removed and chemotherapy began.
   On Sunday, Carlson tried to wrestle a gun from a deputy sheriff
guarding him. His attorney said it was an attempt to commit suicide.
   On Thursday, he died. The controversy continues.
   Gerash said he talked to almost all of the personalities, and
said no one really understood Carlson or his illness.
   ``Most of the time I talked to Justin. He varied a lot between
Justin, and another personality Steve, a 40-year-old person who was
very articulate. In 1985, he developed another personality, Holden,
a hospital personality. I also saw a weeping child, Blue, handling
the leukemia. There was a child of 11, Gray, and I saw Black. I was
threatened once by Black.
   ``I saw another guy, Norman, who was prehomicidal, a
tough-talking New Yorker who smokes. Carlson was allergic to smoke,
but I saw him smoke,'' he said.
   However, the judge was not the only one who doubted Carlson's
diagnosis. A columnist in the Denver Post on Sunday criticized the
$1,180 a day spent on caring for Carlson's leukemia, which also
will be billed to taxpayers because his trust fund ran out.
   The columnist, Woody Paige, wrote: ``Doctors have talked to a
myriad of Carlson-produced personalities _ Steve, Justin, Black,
Blue, Gray, Stacey, Michael, Norman and the Anti-christ. Where's
Dopey and Sneezy? Is this one person, or a touch football team?
   ``I'm certainly not making light of mental illness. Trust me. It
is a serious matter. But the Mighty Carlson Art Players and their
act is beginning to wear thin.''
   Gerash said he understands the anger from the community.
   ``When you kill your father and mother, that's a wholesale
violation of the Ten Commandments,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A skinny and smelly 8-year-old beagle
is back home with his owners after being trapped for 19 days in a
city sewer.
   Diablo appeared healthy except for an infected ear and weight
loss, Marilyn Jackson said. The dog weighed 43 pounds when he
disappeared, and only 19 pounds wen he was recovered this week.
   ``It's amazing. He looks wonderful. There isn't a broken bone in
his body,'' she said.
   Jackson said Diablo and the family's other pet beagle had been
digging out of the yard and running away regularly since the Oct.
17 earthquake, but had always been found in the neighborhood until
one day early this month when only the other dog returned.
   Repeated searches, visits to animal shelters and newspaper ads
turned up no sign of Diablo until another Roseville resident, Patty
Miller, heard something that ``sounded like an echo'' of her two
dogs as they ran in a field.
   After some investigation, Miller said, her dogs led her to a
concrete sewer hole in the field with the manhole cover removed.
   ``I looked down and saw a little dog face looking up at me,''
said Miller, who called the Fire Department, which rescued Diablo
and called the Jacksons.

   Toxicology tests showed no
abnormalities that could be the cause of an Aug. 13 plane crash
that killed Rep. Larkin Smith and his pilot, the cornoner said.
   The tests turned up no drugs or alcohol in either man's blood,
Perry County Coroner Randall Carnahan said Wednesday night. He also
said carbon monoxide levels were within normal limits.
   The results were ``more or less a clean bill of health,''
Carnahan said.
   The final report on the crash could be ready before the first of
the year, said Jorge Prellezo, regional director of the Miami
office of the National Transportation Safety Board.
   ``I can't anticipate when the report will be ready, maybe in a
month or so,'' he said Friday. ``We're still working on that.''
   Prellezo said the NTSB is waiting on a radar report from
Washington, D.C. The report is not expected to contain new
information, he said.
   The single-engine Cessna, flown by Chuck Vierhling, crashed into
the DeSoto National Forest about 13 miles south of New Augusta the
night of Aug. 13. Smith was returning to the Gulf Coast after
participating in opening ceremonies of the Dixie Youth Baseball
World Series in Hattiesburg.
   Smith was elected to Congress in 1988. Gene Taylor, whom Smith
defeated in 1988, won the special election to fill Smith's
unexpired term.
   In the days immediately after the crash, the NTSB ruled out
weather and possibile aircraft malfunctions as the cause of the
crash.

   Police opened fire and hurled tear gas
Friday to halt battling over ballot boxes, and at least 36 people
died in the second day of voting in India's bloody parliamentary
elections.
   At least 88 people have been killed since voting began Wednesday
to elect a new Parliament and to decide the fate of Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi.
   An assailant fired three shots at a polling booth in northern
India moments after opposition leader Vishwanath Pratap Singh
arrived to investigate reports of ballot fraud by Gandhi supporters.
   No one was hurt in the attack, which occurred as Singh was
surrounded by voters complaining that Gandhi's Congress Party was
rigging the vote, witnesses said.
   The national Election Commission, flooded with complaints from
both sides of voter intimidation and fraud, again threw out
thousands of ballots and said those voters must go back to the
polls Saturday. Voting is scheduled to end Sunday.
   At stake in the elections are 524 of the 543 seats in the
policy-making lower house of Parliament, which will choose the next
prime minister.
   Turnout was moderate to heavy in the 10 states and two federally
governed territories that voted Friday. Analysts have said a heavy
turnout could hurt Gandhi, dogged for half of his five-year term by
allegations of high-level corruption in his government.
   Indian elections are traditionally violent. At least 132 people
have been killed in campaign-related violence since Gandhi
announced elections on Oct. 17.
   In southern Karnataka and the northern states of Uttar Pradesh
and Bihar, campaign activists battled Friday while trying to storm
polling booths, tear up ballots and voter lists and stuff or steal
ballot boxes, officials said. At least 33 people were killed.
   Police fired into the air and hurled tear gas to disperse the
stone-throwing mobs there and in Calcutta, the capital of West
Bengal state.
   Mobs in Calcutta attacked an office of the Communist Party of
India-Marxist, the governing party in the state. Police clashed
with supporters of various parties who were attempting to seize
ballot boxes. Three people were killed. Several polling booths also
were bombed, although no one was hurt, officials said.
   In western Gujarat state, authorities imposed an indefinite
curfew in some towns after police fired tear gas to break up
clashes between rival groups.
   The Election Commission in New Delhi has invalidated ballots in
more than 930 of the country's 590,000 voting booths following
reports of fraud.
   The number of repolls ordered by the commission more than
doubles the 480 ordered during the December 1984 elections that
propelled Gandhi to power two months after the assassination of his
mother and predecessor, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.
   Gandhi, whose Congress Party has governed India for all but 29
months since independence from Britain in 1947, is facing the most
cohesive and determined challenge ever mounted by the country's
usually splintered opposition parties.
   The National Front, a five-party coalition with wide-ranging
regional, religious and ideological differences, has promised clean
government.
   Gandhi has told voters that the only party that can provide
stablity is his Congress Party, whose most famous leaders were his
mother and his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru.
   Singh went to the village of Dubrai, 14 miles west of Fatephur
in Uttar Pradesh state, after receiving reports that Congress Party
workers were rigging the ballots.
   The shots apparently were fired from a nearby rooftop after
Singh stepped out of his car and was surrounded by a crowd of
people, said a witness, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Singh refused to say whether he thought the shots were aimed at
him specifically.
   ``The aim was obviously the crowd of people, and I was one of
them,'' said the 58-year-old politican.
   Singh spent all day touring the Fatehpur constituency, saying he
wanted to prevent a recurrence of the allegedly widespread fraud
and voter intimidation that took place in Gandhi's Amethi
constituency during Wednesday's balloting.
   Villagers armed with batons and spears screamed ``Death to the
Congress!'' and promised to protect voters from troublemakers.

   Bad weather Friday night once again
forced British businessman Richard Branson to delay the ``greatest
adventure'' of his life, a hot-air balloon crossing of the Pacific
Ocean.
   As hundreds of townspeople gathered in the cold late Friday and
city officials prepared a fireworks display, Branson held a news
conference to announce the launch was being postponed.
   ``My own feeling was to just tell the guys to get on with it,''
said Branson, dressed in his gray, fireproof flight suit. ``But
there's just nothing you can do about the weather.''
   He said a wind flowing down the side of a hill and onto the
launch area had forced the liftoff, scheduled for 3 a.m. Saturday
(1 p.m. Friday EST) to be called off. He said he did not know when
they would try again.
   A team of at least 60 technicians and staff has been on standby
at the site for more than a week.
   Branson and his co-pilot, Per Lindstrand, want to become the
first people to cross the Pacific in a hot-air balloon. The
6,200-mile flight to San Francisco is expected to take three to
four days, but the two are equipped to spent five days in the
balloon.
   ``I'm about to embark on the greatest adventure of my life, and
I'm determined to enjoy it,'' Branson, founder of Virgin Atlantic
Airways and the Virgin Music Group, said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   He and Lindstrand already hold the hot-air balloon distance
record for a flight across the Atlantic in 1987. That trip ended
when the balloon flew out of control into the Irish Sea off
Scotland.
   Final preparations for this flight, including the 6-hour-long
process of filling up the balloon, began Friday evening on a
baseball diamond in a local park that was turned into a launch pad.
   At the planned cruising altitude of 40,000 feet, winds can reach
200 mph.
   Organizers said the flight would set three records _ duration,
distance and altitude.
   They also said the balloon, dubbed the Virgin Otsuka Pacific
Flyer, is the largest ever built. It has a diameter of 172 feet and
weighs one ton.
   Miyakonojo is a small town surrounded by rice paddies and
volcanic hills on the southern Japanese island of Kyushu. It is
about 560 miles south of Tokyo, far enough away from the city's
busy air space to allow the balloon safe entry into the jet stream.
   City officials had arranged to have a fireworks demonstration at
liftoff and chartered buses to take people to the site.
   No one has successfully crossed the Pacific in a hot-air
balloon, though three Americans and a Japanese adventurer piloted a
helium-filled craft across it, from Japan to California, in 1981.

   President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher agreed today on the need for European stability
as the NATO alliance faces changes in Eastern Europe, the White
House said.
   The two leaders, meeting for 4{ hours at the president's country
retreat, discussed a number of issues to be taken up at Bush's
summit next week with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as
other issues, said presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The president and prime minister discussed reforms under way
in the Soviet Union and agreed on support for glasnost and
perestroika. They both emphasized the pursuit of democracy as the
first step in the reform process,'' said Fitzwater.
   Mrs. Thatcher arrived by helicopter at the snowy hillside
complex where Bush and his family are spending the Thanksgiving
holiday.
   She stepped onto a red carpet rolled out in the snow and was
greeted by Bush, clad in a sports jacket. First lady Barbara Bush,
wearing a down jacket, and daughter Dorothy LeBlond, also greeted
the prime minister.
   Bush, escorting Mrs. Thatcher to a golf cart, said, ``Let's go
before we freeze.'' He said, ``I'm so glad you're here. This is so
timely,'' an apparent reference to the fact that Mrs. Thatcher's
visit comes a week before Bush will hold a shipboard summit with
Gorbachev.
   Asked by reporters what they would discuss, Bush said before
driving off in the golf cart, ``I'm just interested in getting the
views of the prime minister on the rapid changes in eastern Europe
and the strength of the alliance and everything else. So we've got
a good full agenda.''
   Asked if the two leaders had any disagreements on the strength
of NATO, Mrs. Thatcher replied emphatically, ``No. None.'' Mrs.
Thatcher has been firm in her statements that the strength of NATO
should not be lessened, despite overtures from the Soviet Union and
moves toward political and economic reform in several eastern
European countries.
   In an NBC-TV ``Today'' interview earlier, she said that merely
expressing a willingness for political reform is a lot different
than actually achieving it.
   She told CBS-TV's ``This Morning'' that she did not expect
Gorbachev to have any ``major surprises'' at the summit.
   ``After all, look at the events which have happened. ... I think
that he'll want to work towards much greater security and to try to
bring about the economic reform,'' she said.
   Bush in recent days has emphasized that he intends to consult
fully with U.S. allies before meeting with Gorbachev and that he
would spring ``no surprises'' on the NATO allies.
   Mrs. Thatcher was to remain at Camp David for four hours before
returning to Washington in the afternoon.
   Mrs. Thatcher said on ABC's ``Good Morning America'' program
today that she was ``delighted'' with Bush's speech in which he
praised Gorbachev's reforms, and praised Bush's ``measured
response'' to changes in Eastern Europe.
   ``It takes a long time to build democracy,'' she said. ``It's
not so long to have demonstrations and to try to say that you want
to tear down that system. It takes a much longer time to build up
the new one.''
   Mrs. Thatcher is effusive in her praise of Gorbachev _ with whom
she has met several times _ lauding him as a reformer of courage
and vision. But she is also cautious about his chances of
completing the revolution he has unleashed.
   Therefore, she continues to advocate a strong NATO and opposes
any changes in the present lineup of NATO and Warsaw Pact forces,
lest they become ammunition for Gorbachev's hard-line foes.
   Her legislative program for 1990 pledges Britain to uphold its
NATO obligations and ``sustain the United Kingdom's contribution to
Western defense by maintaining adequate and effective nuclear and
conventional forces.''
   The 64-year-old prime minister is facing political troubles at
home. Resurgent inflation and criticism of her combative leadership
style have helped push her behind the opposition Labor Party in
opinion polls.
   On Wednesday, rank-and-file lawmaker Sir Anthony Meyer announced
plans to challenge Mrs. Thatcher for the leadership of the
Conservative Party _ a position that has gone to her as a matter of
formality during her 10 years in office.
   Meyer conceded he has no chance of success, but said he hoped to
send the prime minister a message of disenchantment and possibly
lure a major contender into the race if it should go to a second
round of voting.
   Mrs. Thatcher, in an interview published today, rebuffed the
unprecedented challenge to her leadership, saying she is ready to
fight two more general elections.
   The Times of London quoted her as saying this week, ``By popular
acclaim (in the party) I am happy to carry on.''

<HEAD>Parade Readers Want `America the Beautiful' As Anthem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 80 percent of the readers who responded to
a questionnaire would like to see the country's national anthem
changed to ``America the Beautiful,'' Parade magazine says.
   Of the nearly 400,000 Americans who responded, 315,000 want to
change the anthem, while only 74,000 voted to keep ``The
Star-Spangled Banner.''
   Parade asked readers their opinion in a questionnaire printed in
the magazine in August 1988.
   The results of the responses mailed in by readers are printed in
Sunday's issue, along with an article by Rep. Andrew Jacobs,
D-Ind., who has reintroduced a bill in Congress to change the
anthem.
   ``America the Beautiful,'' Jacobs writes, ``celebrates our power
and our ability to live and work in peace, the beauty that is in
our land and the possibilities inherent in our people.''
   Jacobs says he objects to ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' because
it celebrates war and because its music ``was written in
18th-century England by John Stafford Smith as a sex and drinking
song.''
   Despite its stirring lyrics and melody, ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' is also hard to sing. Referring to the words, ``O'er the
land of the free and the home of the brave,'' Jacobs said: ``I love
that line even if I can't sing it.''
   He suggests keeping ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' for military
ceremonies.

<HEAD>Drinking of Hard Liquor At Lowest Level In Three Decades</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans' consumption of hard liquor has fallen
to its lowest level in three decades, federal health researchers
reported Friday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported that
per-capita consumption of distilled spirits in 1986, the last year
for which complete statistics are available, was the lowest since
1959.
   The average American drank 0.85 gallons of spirits in 1986, the
lowest since 1959's 0.84 gallons, according to researcher Darryl
Bertolucci of the Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health
Administration.
   Preliminary statistics indicate that the decline continued in
1987, to 0.83 gallons, Bertolucci said.
   Distilled spirits are hard liquors such as whiskey, rum, vodka
or gin. Beer and wine, which are fermented but not distilled, are
considered separately. However, CDC statistics show that
consumption of alcoholic beverages as a whole is on the decline.
   In its weekly report, the CDC said the drop in consumption of
distilled spirits between 1985 and 1986 was the sharpest since
1956, in terms of both actual cases sold and the percentage of the
decrease. Exact statistics behind those findings were not available
Friday because of the holiday weekend.
   ``The decline in spirits consumption may represent changes in
the drinking patterns and preferences in the drinking-aged
population,'' the CDC said. ``These changes were reflected by
greater interest in beverages with reduced alcohol content (light
beers and wine coolers), as well as increased public awareness
regarding physical fitness, nutrition and alcohol abuse.''
   Per-capita consumption of ethanol _ the actual alcohol in
alcoholic beverages _ was 2.58 gallons from all beverages in 1986,
the lowest since 2.64 gallons in 1977, the CDC said.
   Two out of three American adults drink, but a relatively small
number of them account for most of the consumption of alcoholic
beverages, the CDC said: 10 percent of drinkers, or 6.5 percent of
the U.S. adult population, account for half of all the alcohol
consumed in the nation.
   Public health officials say average daily consumption of one
ounce or more of ethanol _ about two beers, cocktails or glasses of
wine _ is ``heavy drinking,'' and heavy drinkers run a seven-times
greater risk of liver cirrhosis than non-heavy drinkers.
   At least 46 percent of the cirrhosis deaths among U.S. men, and
at least 15 percent of cirrhosis deaths among women, is
attributable to heavy drinking, the CDC said.
   The CDC reported Friday that 26,151 Americans died of chronic
liver disease and cirrhosis in 1986; 42 percent of those deaths
were associated with alcohol.
   In another 13,475 deaths, chronic liver disease was a
``contributing cause,'' among other causes, the CDC said.
   High rates of death from chronic liver disease were scattered
across the country, topped by 31 such deaths per 100,000 residents
in Washington, D.C. Lowest was Arkansas, with six deaths per
100,000 people.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Quietly Issue U.S. Military Attache Visa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sandinista government has issued a
visa for a new U.S. Embassy military attache in another quiet
attempt to warm diplomatic relations between the two countries.
   According to one source, Nicaragua recently offered to exchange
ambassadors, but the report could not be immediately confirmed.
   Both countries expelled each other's ambassadors in July 1988,
along with seven other diplomatic officers apiece.
   Earlier this year, both countries exchanged some junior
diplomats, only to engage shortly afterward in more expulsions.
   On both occasions, Nicaragua accused U.S. diplomats of plotting
to destabilize the government.
   U.S. Army Lt. Col. Dennis Quinn, the new military attache,
arrived in Nicaragua two weeks ago, as soon as his visa was issued
by the Nicaragua government, said a U.S. Embassy spokesman who
spoke on condition his name not be used.
   ``The Nicaraguans didn't indicate the reason why they allowed
him in,'' the spokesman said.
   Quinn had been ready to take up his post in Managua for more
than eight months, the spokesman said. Quinn's predecessor, U.S.
Army Lt. Col. Ray Fernandez, left in April.
   ``This hasn't led to any fundamental change in the visa
situation or restaffing of the embassy,'' the spokesman said.
   Mercedes Borge, spokeswoman at the Nicaragua Foreign Ministry,
said the Nicaraguan government has not sent a military attache to
its mission in Washington.
   A diplomatic source who demanded anonymity said Victor Hugo
Tinoco, the Nicaraguan deputy foreign minister, met with U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson in Washington on Nov.
18 and offered to exchange ambassadors.
   Tinoco had been in Washington heading a delegation in peace
talks with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels. The talks collapsed
Tuesday.
   No one at the Foreign Ministry was available to comment on the
purported offer by Tinoco.
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other U.S. Embassy
officers were expelled July 11, 1988, after an opposition march in
the town of Nandaime ended in violent clashes between government
forces and the marchers. The Sandinista government accused the
United States of instigating the demonstration.
   The U.S. government retaliated, expelling Nicaraguan Ambassador
Carlos Tunnermann and seven other Nicaraguan Embassy officials from
Washington.
   The expulsions kicked off a ``visa war,'' with Nicaragua
establishing a rule requiring a 15-day waiting period for visas for
U.S. diplomats. Washington stopped issuing visas to Nicaraguans,
saying the decision was because of the reduction in its consular
personnel in Managua.
   Since then, both embassies have been understaffed and run by
junior officers.
   In January, in what the Nicaragua government said was a sign of
its good will, Nicaragua offered to stop the visa war. Within
weeks, Managua and Washington had issued each other visas to
replace the junior diplomats expelled in July 1988.
   But with the expulsion in May of the two U.S diplomats, the visa
war was on again.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will meet with
NATO defense ministers in Brussels Nov. 28-29 where fast-moving
events in Eastern Europe are expected to ``overwhelm the agenda,''
an official said Friday.
   Cheney leaves Washington Saturday for The Netherlands. He'll
meet with the prime minister of that country and visit an American
military unit before proceeding to Belgium for the annual NATO
Defense Planning Committee meeting.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition he not
be identified, said the NATO agenda includes discussion of issues
such as cost-sharing, the relationship between arms control and
defense planning and the negotiations under way to reduce
conventional forces in Europe.
   But the official added: ``Overwhelming the agenda is what's
going on in Eastern Europe. ... Our European friends feel the same
excitement we do.''
   Despite the rapidly unfolding changes, the official said
Cheney's overall message is to ``reaffirm the need for NATO.''
   He added that the United States has pledged maintain its
financial commitment to NATO through 1990. This comes at a time the
Pentagon is planning to slash spending by $180 billion in the
1992-1994 budget years.
   President Bush said in an interview with foreign journalists
earlier this week that the NATO allies would be consulted on any
further cuts in U.S. deployments in Europe. But he said he could
not rule out such cuts.

<TEXT>
   County officials have a gift for Alejandro
Espinoza, a check for $6,388.81, his share of the reward for
helping capture convicted ``Night Stalker'' killer Richard Ramirez.
   The problem is that Espinoza helped capture Ramirez and then
quietly slipped away.
   ``Nobody seems to know his whereabouts,'' Larry Monteilh,
executive officer to the county Board of Supervisors, said recently.
   Monteilh said Espinoza filed a claim for his share of the
$36,777 reward, but failed to include his address. Others who
helped capture Ramirez received their reward money earlier this
week.
   Ramirez is in San Quentin State Prison. He was sentenced Nov. 7
to die in the gas chamber. His sentence carried an automatic appeal.
   The 29-year-old self-described devil worshiper was convicted of
13 murders and 30 other felonies, including rape, burglary and
sodomy.
   Authorities said Espinoza helped police recover property taken
from the homes of some of the Night Stalker victims.
   ``My recollection was that this was one of the people who led us
to the person to whom Ramirez was selling stolen property,'' said
Deputy District Attorney P. Philip Halpin. ``That was a big break
in the case.''
   ``We'll continue to hold his money in trust until he shows up,''
Monteilh said.

   A No. 7 train made its run with an extra car on
Friday morning, its doors opening at elevated stops where the last
car did not reach the platform, the Transit Authority said.
   ``I dread to think what could have happened. We were lucky, most
definitely,'' said TA spokesman Termaine Garden after the mistake
was discovered at 7:40 a.m. There were no injuries reported.
   The train's operator and conductor, who were responsible for
inspecting the subway before it went into service Friday, will both
be tested for drugs and alcohol, said Garden.
   According to the spokesman, the platforms on the No. 7 line can
accommodate 11-car subway trains, but the train left the yard in
the borough of Queens on Friday with 12 cars.
   Each time the train stopped at an elevated station in Queens,
the doors on the last car opened beyond the platform, Garden said.
Although the TA believes some passengers were in the car, no one
walked out of the train and off the platform, he said.
   The train yard supervisor will also be questioned, Garden said.
The train made 19 stops in Queens and Manhattan before a supervisor
noticed the extra car, he said.

   It was a strange type of anniversary,
but it was an anniversary of sorts for socialite Mollie Wilmot:
five years since a freighter crashed her seawall, damaged her
swimming pool and stuck around for 105 days.
   ``I'm afraid the Mercedes is with me for life,'' the department
store heiress and race horse breeder said this week.
   Even in New York, ``I'll be walking alone on some obscure
street, and someone will ask me, `Any more ships in your back
yard?''' Wilmot said as she cuddled her white Pekingese, Fluff,
underneath the gazebo next to her renovated pool.
   Five years ago Thursday, when a maid jostled Wilmot awake and
summoned her to a window to see it, she thought the rusting, aging
Mercedes I ``an apparition,'' then realized otherwise.
   ``It was the most unusual thing, and that's putting it mildly,''
she said.
   The Mercedes remained grounded for the next 105 days due to
mechanical problems and uncooperative weather.
   Wilmot acted as the unflagging gracious hostess to its frazzled
crew, police, the Coast Guard, state environmental officials and a
throng of media types who barged into Wilmot's home, next to the
Kennedy estate on North Ocean Boulevard.
   There were Mercedes' T-shirts that proclaimed, ``I know Mollie
very well,'' freighter-shaped chocolates, a Mercedes song that got
air time and even a postcard, a photo taken from a helicopter by
some entrepreneur. As many as 145,000 of the postcards reportedly
were sold in Germany, Wilmot said.
   The state Department of Natural Resources got stuck for the
$220,000 removal fee _ the money came out of Florida's oil spill
contingency fund _ and Wilmot's insurance picked up the tab for her
damaged seawall and pool.

Smathers says he's gratified because the dance style has attracted
about 5,000 people to this weekend's convention.
   The cloggers represent more than 40 states. Five hundred came
from Canada and one troupe arrived from Australia.
   ``I came here 31 years ago and when I came here, the word
`clogger' or `clog dancer' wasn't even in the dictionary,''
Smathers said. ``They defined `clog' as a dance performed with a
wooden-sole shoe.''
   ``I think it's great it's grown to this proportion,'' he said.
``They sort of recognize me as the guru of the whole thing.''
   Clogging, a hallmark of mountain culture, is a style of dance in
which the feet keep the beat of the music.

   Joffrey Ballet star Tina LeBlanc is now the
Sugar Plum Fairy, but time was at age 6 when she danced the role of
the Littlest Angel in the Christmas classic ``The Nutcracker.''
   Miss LeBlanc, 23, who was dancing the Plum role Friday and
Saturday night at City Center, recalled how as a child in Dover,
Del., she began her career as the Fairy's pet the Littlest Angel in
the beginning of the second act.
   The Sugar Plum Fairy is a ``gut buster of a role,'' the dancer
said. ``In addition to being very pure and classical, it has a very
hard pas de deux. ... You have to keep your body very pulled up.
It's hard to find spots where you can breathe. ... But by the end
of the season last year, I had it down so that I could go off stage
and just puff a little and not collapse.''

<HEAD>EC Says Poland Needs More Food Aid To Get Through Winter</HEAD>

   The West must increase food aid to
Poland to help Poles make it through winter shortages, the European
Community Commission said Friday.
   Officials from two dozen Western nations met to discuss economic
and food aid they have given to Poland and Hungary. More than $370
million in food aid has been pledged to Poland, and more than
one-third of that has been delivered. The remainder will be sent by
year's end.
   More is needed, the EC Commission said in a statement.
   The Commission put no price tag on the second food aid package
under study. But EC External Relations Commissioner Frans
Andriessen suggested recently it should total at least $220 million.
   The Commission is coordinating an international aid effort for
Poland and Hungary involving the 12 EC nations and a dozen other
countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and Australia.
   Most donor nations have lifted restrictions on Polish and
Hungarian imports, it said.
   Officials said that in all, donor nations have pledged about
$6.5 billion in food and economic aid, including $2.8 billion from
the European Community and $1 billion from the United States.
   They offered this rough outline:
   _ $443.8 million in food aid for Poland.
   _ About $1 billion in development aid _ including funds for
management training and environmental protection programs _ for
both Poland and Hungary.
   _ $470 million toward a currency stabilization fund for Poland.
   _ $4.3 billion in investment credits for both Hungary and Poland.
   _ $211 million in other credits for Poland, including $144
million for joint ventures.
   About 340 joint ventures have already been set up in Hungary and
320 in Poland with Western aid, officials said. Efforts are under
way in such areas as agriculture, management training, environment
and investments.
   These include training schemes for administrators, banking
personnel and language teachers; joint action to fight pollution
and improve waste management.
   Specific commitments to the two funds are expected to be made
during a ministerial meeting of the 24 donor nations, to be held
here Dec. 13. Polish and Hungarian government officials have been
invited to attend that meeting.
   Western aid, notably long-term development loans and investment
credits, is conditional on Poland and Hungary continuing the
process of democratization and reaching accords with the
International Monetary Fund on restructuring their economic and
financial operations.

   A City Council session called Friday to mark the
second anniversary of Mayor Harold Washington's death was scratched
when only about a dozen of the city's 50 aldermen showed up.
   While some attributed the low turnout to continued divisions on
the council, most called it a question of scheduling and said the
city's first black mayor would be honored Monday instead.
   Mayor Richard Daley's press secretary, Avis LaVelle, said notice
was too short _ the gathering was announced by Alderman Robert Shaw
on Wednesday afternoon.
   Daley has scheduled another memorial during Monday's council
meeting, she said.
   ``This is not some sinister plot,'' LaVelle said. ``It's a
reality of the holiday season. Many people had long-standing
vacation plans or arranged to take today off.''
   Although Shaw acknowledged that he didn't call for the gathering
until 1:42 p.m. Wednesday, he blamed the lack of attendance on the
city clerk's office, which is required by law to notify aldermen of
meetings.
   ``It's ridiculous, it's ludicrous,'' Shaw huffed. ``It smells
like Daley got his hand in the whole thing.''
   Other aldermen, milling around the council chambers after the
meeting was canceled, said the small turnout was unfortunate but
not sinister.
   ``I don't ascribe any racial motives to the failure of people to
attend today,'' said Alderman Timothy Evans, who was Washington's
council floor leader and later ran against Daley for mayor. ``I
suspect it has more to do with the timing.''
   Washington died two years ago Saturday after suffering a heart
attack while working at his City Hall desk.
   His first term was marked by a split in the council between
old-line machine Democrats and a coalition of Washington
supporters. The division stalled most of Washington's appointments
and programs.
   He forged a council coalition shortly before winning re-election
in April 1987.
   Most on Friday agreed council relations have progressed
considerably since the acrimonious ``Council Wars'' that plagued
much of Washington's administration.
   ``The bridges that he built are still in place,'' said Evans.
   Washington left behind a legacy of ``respect for all segments of
our society _ the clock on those activities can never be turned
back,'' he said.
   ``Certainly city government will not and can not operate as it
had operated before Mayor Harold Washington,'' said Alderman Bobby
Rush. ``The council has really become a legislative body.''
   But racial divisions continue to plague the council, Rush said.
   ``Race relations are still a very, very serious problem ... we
still have a long way to go.''
   Members of Washington's family planned a private memorial
service Saturday at his gravesite.

   Paul McCartney spent Thanksgiving here
as part of a five-night gig that marked the first time he has
played in North America in 13 years.
   A lot of fans gave special thanks and a lot of money for the
privilege of seeing him since some tickets sold for more than $600.
   ``A man like this, you have to think of him as an old master,''
said fan Teddy Chavez, 37. ``He's like Rembrandt, Van Gogh. That's
what Paul McCartney is to modern music.''
   ``I'm 42 years old and I have been waiting 25 years for this
moment,'' added fan Donna Contreras. ``This is the epitome of my
life. Unfortunately, everything is downhill from here.''
   For the 15,000 fans who celebrated Thanksgiving with McCartney
at the arena, the one-time Beatle and his unnamed band provided a
mix of now and then.
   He opened with ``Figure of Eight'' from his newest album. He
followed that with ``Flowers in the Dirt,'' ``Jet'' and ``Band on
the Run.'' After that, Beatle music took center stage.

   Eleven journalists and one scientist were
flown to Chile on Friday after being stranded for about two weeks
in Antarctica, a spokeswoman for a South Pole expedition announced.
   The group had been been dropped off at a camp of the
International Trans-Antarctic Expedition on Nov. 8, and was
supposed to be picked up about four days later. But the
expedition's plane was grounded when it ran low on fuel and it was
forced to land on remote King George Island, off the west coast of
Antarctica.
   With the plane finally refueled this week, the dozen people were
picked up and taken to the expedition's base in Punta Arenas,
Chile, spokeswoman Cathy de Moll said in St. Paul. All were
reported to be in good health.
   The group had been flown to the camp in the Patriot Hills, about
830 miles from the South Pole, to meet with members of the
expedition, who had arrived on Nov. 7 en route to the pole. The
trekkers resumed their trip two days later, and were reported to be
453 miles from the South Pole on Friday.
   However, the plane's repeated delays, blamed on weather and
technical problems, have prompted concerns about the expedition's
chances for finishing its 4,000-mile journey by early March, before
weather makes travel out of the area impossible.
   The plane is needed to lay four more food caches in the 1,000
miles between the South Pole and the Soviet base of Vostok.
   The expedition, led by Will Steger, is making its seven-month
journey to bring world attention to Antarctica and to demonstrate
the power of international cooperation. The expedition's other
members are from the Soviet Union, France, Great Britain, Japan and
China.
   Despite high waves of ice, the team has averaged 24 miles a day
during the past week, and may take a day off when it reaches its
next food cache, expected Sunday, de Moll said.
   All food caches beyond Vostok are already in place. But for the
team to finish its trip, de Moll said it must arrive at Vostok
before temperatures drop below minus-50 degrees, and from there
complete the remaining 860 miles before winds hit 150 mph and all
transportation off the continent becomes impossible in early March.
   ``As weather conditions and maintenance of the airplane make
this schedule extremely tight, expedition managers are
investigating all other possible options including recalculating
what essentials must be transported, hiring additional planes and a
parachute drop of 50 barrels of fuel at the South Pole by Soviet
aircraft,'' de Moll said.
   ``We're working on combining every possible solution and we are
confident that with everybody's help we can pull it off,'' she
said. ``This should be interpreted by no one as a sign of giving
up.''
   The group that had been stranded at the Patriot Hills camp
included three French film crew members, one Australian television
journalist, one French still photographer, one French television
journalist, two German magazine journalists, two members of an ABC
Sports crew, one U.S. print reporter and one Saudi Arabian
oceanographer.

<HEAD>Labor Leader Threatens to Leave Cabinet; 17 Palestinians Wounded</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice Premier Shimon Peres was quoted Friday as
saying his left-leaning Labor Party will resign from Israel's
governing coalition unless more progress is made in Middle East
peace efforts.
   Peres' remarks contrasted with upbeat comments from Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who returned from a visit to the United
States, France and Italy and said he had succeeded in relieving
pressure on Israel to speak to the PLO.
   In Jerusalem, a homemade bomb was found outside the home of a
surgeon who transplanted the heart of an Israeli soldier killed by
Arab guerrillas into a Palestinian. A person called two newspapers
and claimed responsibility on behalf of right-wing Jewish
extremists.
   In other unrest, troops shot and wounded 17 Palestinians,
including a 9-year-old and two 12-year-old boys, during clashes in
the occupied Gaza Strip, Arab reports said. The army confirmed one
wounding and said it was checking the other reports.
   In his latest threat to topple the government, Peres said
Shamir's talks in Washington, Paris and Rome ``did not change
anything'' in the negotiations process, army radio said.
   ``If the Likud continues to be obstinate, there is a doubt Labor
will sit with it in one government,'' Peres reportedly said,
referring to the right-wing party Shamir heads.
   The uneasy Likud-Labor alliance was forged after inconclusive
parliamentary elections last year. Peres has repeatedly said he
would dissolve the partnership unless Shamir succeeded in starting
peace talks with Palestinians.
   The parties are divided over what concessions to make for peace.
Labor advocates withdrawing from some occupied lands, while Likud
objects to that.
   Neither party has a majority in Parliament, with Likud and Labor
holding 40 and 39 seats respectively in the 120-member legislature.
   If Labor resigns, it would likely mean early national elections,
which are currently scheduled for 1992.
   Shamir, who spoke to reporters after his plane landed at Ben
Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv, claimed he had advanced
his proposal to hold elections in the occupied territories as part
of an interim plan for self-rule for Palestinians.
   He said President Bush and Baker assured him during meetings in
Washington ``in a clear and unambiguous way that the U.S. would not
ask Israel to negotiate with the PLO.''
   Regarding his talks in Europe, Shamir said he hoped to overcome
continued French and Italian demands that Israel negotiate with the
PLO. ``If we do not succeed in convincing them, we can at least
weaken their opposition,'' Shamir said.
   Palestinians have balked at agreeing to elections because the
Israeli plan omits a role for the PLO and fails to guarantee
eventual statehood in the occupied lands.
   In Jerusalem, police spokesman Uzi Sandori said a makeshift bomb
rigged inside a seltzer bottle was found outside the home of Dr.
Dov Simon, who transplanted the heart of soldier Zeev Traum into
Palestinian Hanna Khader on Nov. 15. Traum had died of a gunshot
wound suffered in the Gaza Strip two days earlier.
   An anonymous caller to the Yediot and Haariv dailies Friday
claimed a right-wing group called the Sicarites planted the bomb
and another left outside the home of a Jerusalem professor who
invited a Palestinian activists to speak at Hebrew University.
   ``If they do not leave the country within a week, we will wait
for them in a dark corner with a machine gun,'' Maariv quoted the
caller as saying.

   The government Friday declared
four neighborhoods in the country open to all races, easing a
39-year-old policy of strict residential segregation.
   ``I hope this will be proof of the government's serious attempt
to normalize a lot of situations in our country,'' said Planning
Minister Hernus Kriel.
   It was the latest in a series of acts by President F.W. de Klerk
aimed at reducing racial friction in South Africa.
   The far-right Conservative Party, which favors rigid
segregation, condemned the decision.
   ``Mr. de Klerk ignores the existence of ... white community life
and draws a line through the traditional way of life and ideals by
which whites have lived for centuries in this country,'' said J.H.
van der Merwe, a member of Parliament for the Conservatives.
   ``The Conservative Party warns Mr. de Klerk once again urgently
not to try to suppress the ability of whites to resist.''
   De Klerk, who assumed office in August, said he favors selected
multiracial neighborhoods but will maintain segregated schools and
residential districts for whites who want them.
   The four newly integrated neighborhoods are District Six in Cape
Town; a downtown section in the Indian Ocean city of Durban; a
thinly populated suburban area between Johannesburg and Pretoria;
and a small part of Boksburg, an industrial city east of
Johannesburg.
   De Klerk on Thursday proclaimed that people of any race may own
businesses in Boksburg, overruling the council's effort to restrict
ownership to whites.
   Anti-apartheid activists said opening only small ``free
settlement areas'' will lead to overcrowding due to the acute
housing shortage in black townships nationwide.
   ``While welcoming any move away from racially zoned areas, we
cannot admit to being ecstatic,'' said Cas Coovadia of Actstop, a
group that has fought residential segregation.
   Coovadia said the move was an attempt to amend, rather than
repeal, the Group Areas Act, which has formally segregated all
neighborhoods by race since 1950.
   District Six, within walking distance of downtown Cape Town, was
a ragged but lively multiracial neighborhood until the government
declared it a ``whites-only'' area in 1966 and renamed it
Zonnebloem. About 40,000 non-whites were forced out and all the
buildings were razed except for churches and mosques.
   So deep is the bitterness created by the evictions that few Cape
Town whites or businesses have sought any part of the area, and it
remains an empty field.
   The multiracial Durban neighborhood is made up mostly of aging,
downtown apartment buildings where some blacks already live.
   The area between Johannesburg and Durban has few residents but
is expected to become a middle-class development.
   Boksburg has drawn international attention since the far-right
Conservative Party won control of the town council last year and
began reimposing strict apartheid.
   The neighborhood that will be open to all races has fewer than
50 houses and many already are owned by Indian families.
   In another development Friday, a whites-only public school for
girls that faced closure because it had too few students will
become a multiracial private school, officials said.
   Education officials this year said they planned to close the
102-year-old Johannesburg Girls High School because enrollment
dropped to 200 students, or one-third of capacity.
   Teachers, parents and students launched a campaign to keep the
school open and said they would welcome black and Indian students
to help increase enrollment.

   There's only one thing worse than
spending hours shopping in a crowded, noisy department store on one
of the busiest days of the holiday shopping season. Working there.
   I found out the hard way.
   I knew it was going to be busy in my day at the Younkers
Department Store when I saw the parking lot at Merle Hay Mall
filling up and the shoppers crowding into the lobby just outside
the sales floor more than a quarter-hour before the store's early 8
a.m. opening.
   Back in my hometown of Philadelphia, merchants and commissioned
sales clerks have a real love-hate relationship with the official
kick-off of the Christmas shopping countdown. They call it ``Black
Friday'' for the sea of heads and the ungodly congestion in the
malls and parking lots.
   I've always avoided even shopping then because journalists
usually work on holidays. This year I avoided the shopping but not
the crowds.
   One sore back, two aching feet, four long hours and about a
hundred customers later, I thankfully went back to my real job.
   I was plunked behind the costume jewelry-watch counter in
accessories and given a few tips about where the gift boxes were
and what was on sale. By the time my five-minute orientation was
over, customers were peering into display cases all around me and
asking me questions. Within a few more minutes the rush was so
constant there wasn't even time to visit the restroom.
   Most of the shoppers were nice, particularly the ones excited
about finding just the right gift. But there were those who made me
finally understand why it's hard to be the always-polite, smiling
sales clerk. There will always be people who make you want to be
anything but that.
   Such as the lady who ignored her 8-year-old, leaving me to chase
the girl out from behind our cash register and glare at her as she
went around a display of earrings, gleefully snapping shut all the
hinged jewelry boxes my fellow clerks had so carefully arranged.
   Or the woman whose son wanted a PopSwatch _ a watch with a face
that pops out of the case, something I didn't know existed until
Friday. He picked out the first one he tried and said he was sure
it was what he wanted. Mom didn't like it, made me pull out every
other style and then said they'd have to think it over and steered
her disappointed son away, leaving me to put away all those
PopSwatches.
   Or the dozens buying gifts who didn't really know what the
receiver would like, leaving me to use my ESP to find just the
right item. I ended up encouraging everybody to buy exactly what I
liked, mainly so I wouldn't be tempted to spend a lot of money when
I finally knocked off for the afternoon.
   And of course, there were the people who chose Black Friday to
return items they'd bought a week before. And the lady who bought a
watch and returned it in five minutes because she'd already seen
something else she liked better.
   Then there were all the people leaving Cracker Jacks _ in boxes
and loose _ all over our once-spotless counters. They had been
given the boxes at the door as part of a special sale; each box
held a coupon for an extra discount of 10 to 20 percent off one
item, or for a free shopping spree. The gimmick drew lots of
shoppers, but it didn't do much for the condition of the floors.
   I think Younkers, a 37-store chain based in Des Moines, got one
of the best deals of the day.
   I sold about 50 watches and the jewelry section was so busy all
morning I kept wondering how they would have gotten by without me.
And the area manager said she was hoping I would stay the whole day.
   My back and feet said otherwise.

   A barge that was adrift south of Prince
William Sound with more than 5 million gallons of jet fuel on board
resumed its tow to Anchorage on Friday after an inspection revealed
no damage to the vessel.
   The 400-foot barge was towed out of Port Etches on Hinchinbrook
Island by the same tug which lost it in rough weather Tuesday in
the Gulf of Alaska.
   The tow cable, which was new and had been installed just a week
earlier, should have held despite the weather, said Dick Simpson, a
spokesman for the barge and tug owner, Crowley Maritime Corp. of
San Francisco.
   ``It had a breaking strength of 500,000 pounds, which is twice
what you normally need,'' Simpson said.
   Commissioner Dennis Kelso of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation praised the Coast Guard for avoiding ``a
potentially major spill.'' Had the barge drifted 12 more hours, it
likely would have hit a reef or island at the entrance to Prince
William Sound, the Coast Guard said.
   The barge broke loose about 90 miles southeast of the sound,
where the tanker Exxon Valdez spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
oil March 24 in the worst oil spill in U.S. history.
   The weather in the area Tuesday included winds up to 92 mph and
20-30 foot swells, which had not been forecast, Simpson said.
   ``It's normally the kind of weather we would have skirted. But
the skipper found himself in the middle of it and tried to make the
best of it,'' he said. The crew of a Coast Guard plane found the
barge Wednesday and a helicopter dropped a radio buoy onto the
vessel to help the tug find it. The tug reconnected to the barge by
early Thursday and it was towed to Port Etches.
   An Army ordnance team had been placed on standby to blow up the
barge and burn the fuel before the vessel could run aground.
   ``Anytime you have a separation you have a potential danger,''
Simpson said. ``But we had a contingency plan and it was under
control.''
   The barge, which originated at Cherry Point, Wash., resumed the
final 360 miles of its trip and was scheduled to arrive Sunday
morning with the fuel destined for Anchorage International Airport.

   Soviet TV on Friday gave its viewers a look at
student strike organizers and Prague's Wenceslas Square packed with
protesters in its continuing open coverage of the reform movement
rattling Eastern Europe.
   But the news that Czechoslovak Communist Party chief Milos Jakes
and other Communist leaders had resigned came too late for it to be
included in the nightly ``Vremya'' news program watched by tens of
millions.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has encouraged reforms in Eastern
Europe that began taking hold in Poland and Hungary as a way of
modernizing the East Bloc, which has fallen behind the West in
technological development.
   On Friday, the Soviet leader warmly welcomed former Solidarity
activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, Poland's new non-communist prime
minister, to the Kremlin for talks.
   The Tass news agency reported it a two-sentence dispatch quoting
the offical Czechoslovak news agency CTK that Jakes and the rest of
the Communist leadershiop had resigned.
   Earlier, ``Vremya'' showed film of student activists organizing,
and large crowds of people on Prague's Wenceslas Square.
   It continued ``Vremya's'' open airing of problems in the East
Bloc allies. Soviet media gave extensive coverage to the huge
demonstrations that led to the resignation of Erich Honecker in
East Germany, and have aired criticism of former Bulgarian leader
Todor Zhivkov.
   ``Vremya'' made no mention of the appearance in Prague of former
party leader Alexander Dubcek, who spoke publicly in the capital
for the first time since he was ousted in 1968. Dubcek led the
``Prague Spring'' reforms that ended with a Warsaw Pact invasion.
   The government newspaper Izvestia told its millions of readers,
however, that Dubcek had appeared at a previous demonstration in
Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia.

   Burley tobacco farmers will be allowed to sell
additional 1989-crop leaf without incurring marketing penalties for
exceeding their basic quotas, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter
said Friday.
   The additional marketings is an amount equal to 5 percent of a
burley farm's basic quota. For example, if a farm's basic quota is
1,000 pounds the action would allow an additional 50 pounds to be
marketed.

<TEXT>
   Sidney Janis, the art gallery owner whose
ability to spot trends helped popularize such movements as Abstract
Expressionism and Pop Art, has died. He was 93.
   Janis died Thursday of pneumonia.
   A onetime vaudeville dancer, Janis began going to art galleries
for fun while working for his brother's chain of shoe stores. He
later became a successful shirt manufacturer and did not open his
own gallery until 1948 at age 52.
   Janis mounted major shows of European masters and had the knack
of promoting already established artists so well his gallery was
known for setting the tone in the art world in the 1950s and '60s.
   His early shows were the first American presentations of Jean
Arp, Robert Delaunay and Joaquin Torres-Garcia. In 1951, he had the
first comprehensive show of Henri Rousseau, and two years later,
Marcel Duchamp mounted a Dada show at his gallery.
   In 1950, he put together works of the Abstract Expressionism
artists Arshile Gorky, Willem de Kooning, Franz Kline, Jackson
Pollock and Mark Rothko.
   In 1961, he mounted ``The New Realists,'' ushering in Pop Art.
Artists who showed with Janis included Claes Oldenburg, George
Segal, Jim Dine and Tom Wesselmann.
   Janis began buying art from School of Paris artists during his
visits to Europe in the late 1920s and early 1930s. He also
traveled throughout the United States during the Depression in
search of primitive artists. Among those he found were a West
Virginia steelworker, Patrick J. Sullivan, and a retired Brooklyn
slipper manufacturer, Morris Hirshfield.
   In 1967, he gave his private collection of 103 works to the
Museum of Modern Art. Valued at $2 million at the time, the
collection of paintings by Picasso, Piet Mondrian, Paul Klee,
Umberto Boccioni and others would now be worth more than $100
million.
   Janis also wrote two books with his wife on Surrealism and
Picasso.
   He was active in the Sidney Janis Gallery until his 90th
birthday. His sons Carroll and Conrad and a grandson run the
gallery today.
   Janis' wife, Harriet, died in 1963. In addition to his sons, he
is survived by a daughter, Robin, all of New York City. A sister,
Carolyn Raport, lives in Los Angeles.
   A funeral was scheduled Sunday at Riverside Memorial Chapel.

<HEAD>Prosecutors Try 15 Ethnic Albanians; Former Vice President Charged</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SLOBODAN LEKIC</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TITOVA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors on Friday
indicted a former provincial Communist Party chief and 14 other
ethnic Albanians on charges of instigating unrest that left 25
people dead in southern Yugoslavia.
   Police ringed the courthouse in this Kosovo mining town 120
miles south of the capital Belgrade while Azem Vlasi and the others
were formally indicted. There were fears of new unrest by ethnic
Albanians, many of whom consider 42-year-old Vlasi their leader.
   Also Friday, the government Tanjug news agency said former
Yugoslav vice president Fadil Hoxha also has been charged with
fanning ethnic Albanian nationalism in Kosovo province by publicly
making ``insulting comments'' about non-Albanians in the province.
   It said Hoxha, a close associate of the late President Josip
Broz Tito who served as the country's No. 2 leader in the late
1970s, will be tried in the Kosovo town of Prizren for comments he
allegedly made in November 1986. If convicted, he faces a maximum
10-year prison sentence.
   In the court in Titova Mitrovica, authorities read a 99-page
indictment of Vlasi and the 14 others that charged them with
``counterrevolutionary'' activities in connection with rioting by
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo in February and March.
   Prosecutor Spasoje Zamfirovic, reading the indictment, said they
destroyed ``the brotherhood and unity'' of Yugoslavia's ethnically
disparate peoples. Authorities later adjourned the proceedings for
a week.
   Ethnic Albanians make up about 85 percent of the 1.9 million
people in Kosovo, an adminstrative part of the republic of Serbia.
The riots were sparked by constitutional changes _ opposed by Vlasi
_ that gave Serbia tighter judicial and police control over the
province.
   At least three ethnic Albanians, who protested the trial when it
opened Oct. 30, died in violent clashes with police last month.
   Officials and the media in the western Yugoslav republics of
Slovenia and Croatia, and international human rights organizations,
have denounced the proceedings as a ``show trial'' staged by the
Serbian leadership to intimidate ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
   Authorities in Serbia and Kosovo have consistently denied the
trial is political.
   Louise Christian, a lawyer representing the Paris-based
International Federation for Human Rights, was barred by security
officials from monitoring the trial.
   Vlasi, who was ousted as provincial party chief last year, is
accused of ``secretly visiting'' ethnic Albanian miners who staged
an eight-day sit-in at a nearby mine in February to protest the
adoption of the constitutional changes.

   President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher discussed the NATO alliance amid rapid East bloc
changes Friday _ and were described as ``in very close accord'' _
as he prepared for his talks next week with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev.
   On an issue of crucial concern to Western allies in Europe,
``the two leaders agreed on the need for European stability as NATO
faces the changes in Eastern Europe,'' presidential press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater said after the 4{-hour meeting.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters after the talks that ``NATO is
absolutely vital'' for continued defense of Europe. She said the
allies have agreed on a strategy of, ``Don't disarm too fast ... so
that neither their security nor our security is in jeopardy. That's
absolutely vital.''
   Like Bush, she sought to play down the importance of results
from the summit next weekend. ``I don't think there will be a great
deal of difficulty or sudden surprises,'' she said at a press
conference in Washington.
   Fitzwater said that among other topics, ``The president and
prime minister discussed reforms under way in the Soviet Union and
agreed on support for glasnost and perestroika,'' new Soviet
openness and economic restructuring. ``They both emphasized the
pursuit of democracy as the first step in the reform process,'' in
talking of East-West relations and European stability, he said.
   The two leaders, joined by advisers, talked on a snowswept day
at Bush's country retreat, where the president and his family are
spending a long Thanksgiving holiday weekend.
   ``I'm just interested in getting the views of the prime minister
on the rapid changes in Eastern Europe and the strength of the
alliance and everything else. So we've got a good full agenda,''
Bush told reporters after Mrs. Thatcher arrived by helicopter.
   Mrs. Thatcher in her news conference later described their talks
as ``very relaxed, very valuable.''
   Bush, lightly clad in a sports jacket against the frigid
temperatures, and Mrs. Bush, in a down jacket, along with their
daughter Dorothy LeBlond, greeted Mrs. Thatcher and her entourage
and then drove in golf carts to their house.
   Bush told Mrs. Thatcher, ``I'm so glad you're here. This is so
timely,'' an apparent reference to summit talks with Gorbachev next
weekend on ships in the Mediterranean off the coast of Malta.
   Mrs. Thatcher had been expected to emphasize her view that the
thaw in Western relations with the Soviet Union and the moves
toward democratic reform in Eastern Europe should not lead to a
weakening of the NATO defensive posture.
   Bush said earlier this week that he, too, was committed to
allied strength and would seek consultation with allied leaders.
   He plans to go to Brussels to report to those leaders on the way
back from the summit off the coast of Malta.
   Fitzwater said that during the meeting with Mrs. Thatcher, Bush
summarized plans for the Malta meeting.
   In addition, he said, they discussed regional issues, including
the Mideast peace process, Lebanon, China, Cambodia, Central
America, Afghanistan and others.
   ``The two leaders were in very close accord in their examination
of all the issues discussed today,'' said Fitzwater.
   Also, the White House announced Friday that Bush will meet with
President Francois Mitterrand of France on Dec. 16 in the
Caribbean, to discuss his meeting with Gorbachev and other issues.
French officials said the two leaders would meet on the island of
St. Martin.
   While extending an offer to Gorbachev to work together to end
the Cold War, Bush said Wednesday night that he would not make any
moves during the talks that would surprise the allies.
   The prospect of U.S.-Soviet talks against a backdrop of
encouraging signs across East Europe has produced jitters from some
quarters in Europe that the superpowers might work out a deal to
cut back on NATO and Warsaw Pact forces.
   Bush has repeatedly sought to allay those fears in recent days.
He said in an interview with foreign journalists this week that he
is ``prepared to think anew'' about reducing U.S. troop levels
abroad in light of Eastern Europe's changes but won't act without
the allies.
   ``I'm not suggesting that forevermore we'll have the same levels
of troops anywhere _ standing army, Europe, Korea, anywhere else.
But we're certainly not going to take any unilateral action,'' he
said, pledging to act ``in conjunction with our allies.''
   Asked by reporters at Camp David if she and Bush had different
views on NATO strength, Mrs. Thatcher replied emphatically, ``No.
None.''
   In the latest development in Eastern Europe, one-time reform
leader Alexander Dubcek returned triumphantly to Prague, and
Czechoslovakia's Communist Party, the Politburo and the rest of the
Communist leadership resigned Friday after a week of massive
pro-democracy protests, according to the state-run media.
   Mrs. Thatcher told reporters she hoped to see Czechoslovakia
become a democracy, ``But the wish is not the deed and it does take
quite a long time to get all the democratic structures into place.
And they must be genuine structures, not just a facade.''
   Her U.S. visit comes against a backdrop of political troubles at
home, with inflation and criticism of her combative leadership
style taking a toll.

<TEXT>
   After nearly 20 years in virtual
seclusion, Alexander Dubcek triumphantly returned Friday to the
cheers of 300,000 anti-government protesters urging the rebirth of
changes crushed by Warsaw Pact tanks in 1968.
   The din of hundreds of thousands of voices chanting ``Dubcek!
Dubcek!'' and ``Long live Dubcek!'' reverberated like a deafening
ocean wave throughout Wenceslas Square as the ousted reformist
leader took to the microphone.
   The noise subsided into a hushed, almost ghostly silence as the
crowd waited for Dubcek to utter his first words in public in
Prague since 1969.
   ``I'm glad to be among you,' Dubcek, 67, told the flag-waving
crowd. ``I love you and you know it.''
   ``The ideal of `socialism with a human face' is living in the
minds of a new generation,'' Dubcek declared, using a catch phrase
of his doomed Prague Spring attempts to reform communism 21 years
ago.
   Candles in the windows of the historic, 19th-century gabled
buildings along the square glittered in the cold dusk, lighted to
show solidarity with the burgeoning pro-democracy movement that has
surged triumphantly through Czechoslovakia in the past week.
   Home-made banners mocking the Communist leadership _ one bearing
a cartoon with the caption ``Dinsosaurs: They also had small
brains'' _ flapped in the cold wind as protesters pressed to get a
glimpse of Dubcek at a balcony window.
   For more than an hour, the throng cheered, whistled, shook small
bells furiously and rattled keys in approval as speaker after
speaker called for democratic reform and an end to Comunist Party
monopoly rule.
   After the rally ended, Czechoslovakia's official news agency
reported that party chief Milos Jakes and the rest of the hard-line
leadership had resigned. Karel Urbanek, a Politburo member and
former party leader of the Czech republic, was elected to replace
Jakes.
   For many like Dubcek, the return to Prague was a triumphant and
emotional journey after two decades of forced political exile and
disgrace at the hands of the Communist Party leaders.
   Until the dramatic developments of the past week, Dubcek has
lived in relative obscurity in the Slovak capital of Bratislava. He
worked as a low-level employee of the state forestry services.
   After his expulsion from the Communist Party in June 1970, he
was watched round-the-clock until Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev visited Czechoslovakia in spring 1987.
   Still under surveillance, but freer to act and move, Dubcek
carefully redeveloped contacts with former comrades and with
prominent dissidents.
   He gave cautious interviews to Western media as well as Soviet
and Hungarian TV _ moves that prompted sharp comment to Moscow and
Budapest from hard-line leaders in Prague.
   Last year, in Italy to receive an honorary doctorate, Dubcek
delivered a ringing defense of the Prague Spring.
   But it was not until Thursday, in Bratislava, that Dubcek was
able to return to the public political stage in his own country. On
Friday, his return was complete.
   ``Again, after a longer time, I appear before you and thus
before all our people who once again raised their voices for a
renewal of society, a renewal of our unbreakable community, of our
nations, which are so close and related by blood,'' he said.
   ``This mutual bond is also today a pillar of the present
democratic renewal, our inseparable and indivisible Fatherland of
our two nations, Czechoslovakia.''

   Following, as translated from
Slovak by The Associated Press, are excerpts of Alexander Dubcek's
speech to 300,000 people on Wenceslas Square Friday. He refers to
the two nations of Czechoslovakia, a country formed by Czech lands
and Slovakia:
   Dear popular meeting. My dear residents of Prague, I love you,
you know that, but I will tell you just the same. I am happy to be
with you.
   Again, after a longer time, I appear before you and thus before
all our people who once again raised their voices for a renewal of
society, a renewal of our unbreakable community, of our nations,
which are so close and related by blood. This mutual bond is also
today a pillar of the present democratic renewal, our inseparable
and indivisible Fatherland of our two nations, Czechoslovakia.
   Yesterday, at the square in Bratislava, a crowd of more than
100,000 people met in the spirit of solidarity, of popular civic
initiative which unites us in this historic elation. We all know
that the present state of crisis in the country was caused by
violent military intervention in the affairs and life which have
belonged to the people of this country only. For this reason,
departure from this unhappy legacy and from the whole so-called
policy of normalization and its birth, is unconditional and brooks
no delay.
   This is clearly expressed by the attitudes of all civic
movements, of former Communist Party members who have been
expelled, of youth, artists' and cultural movements, yesterday in
Bratislava and today again here.
   I see this movement has found support in the working class,
among peasants, in all strata of the working people.
   The broad and complex stream of today's great movement should
converge into a joint stream which will once again elevate the
initiative of the people, our country to a place it rightly has in
Europe.
   Today, the new Civic Forum is being formed, with the platform of
a new socialist renewal. I declare that I stand by this platform
and give it my voice before the citizens of Prague and all working
people.
   People of Prague, in unity with all the people, played an
important part in the renewal of socialism 21 years ago.
   I say this because the working class, People's Militias ... with
the sympathies of our army and police stood side-by-side. I say
this, that today, too, these forces should stand on the side of the
people. Do not act against the people, you are a part of it,
remember you are from the people.
   The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the minds
of a new generation.
   Don't give way to extremist trends, so that the people's
movement can be crowned with success and reflect the cultural level
of this nation.
   An old, wise man said, `If once there was light, why should
there be darkness again?' We had lived in darkness for too long.
Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again.

<HEAD>Mubarak Blames Foreign Hand for Egyptian Workers' Problems in Iraq</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAURICE GUINDI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak, in remarks
published Friday, blamed foreign forces for the plight of Egyptian
laborers working in Iraq and accused the Cairo news media of
exaggerating reports about the workers' problems.
   Mubarak did not specify what foreign elements might be involved
nor did he mention the deaths of scores of Egyptians in Iraq.
   Cairo airport officials have said the bodies of about 100
Egyptian laborers arrived from Iraq in October and 50 more in the
first half of this month. They said those figures compared to a
previous montly average of 10-15.
   In many cases Iraqi certificiates listed violence as the cause
of death.
   Thousands of Egyptians have returned from Iraq in recent months.
Some said many of the Egyptian workers were killed in fights with
Iraqis over jobs after tens of thousands of Iraqi soldiers were
demobilized following last year's cease-fire ending the
eight-year-old war with Iran.
   Egypt's government-run Middle East News Agency quoted Mubarak as
saying Thursday that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ``is among the
most sympathetic people toward Egyptians.
   ``I reproach our own media for unduly widening the gap,''
Mubarak said. ``The truth is there have been mistakes made by Iraq
as well as Egyptian individuals.
   ``There are many who do not want our relations with Iraq to be
strong and sustained,'' he said. ``Before formation of the Arab
Cooperation Council, we expected there would be many external
forces that did not want that kind of agreement.''
   Egypt, Iraq, Jordan and North Yemen formed the council last
Februay. Its main purpose is coordination of economic policies.
   The agency said Mubarak praised Iraq for being responsive to
Egyptian questions about the Egyptian workers and expressed
understanding of Iraq's financial difficulties after the war.
   It is estimated that up to 2 million Egyptian workers are in
Iraq, but officials at Cairo airport said more than 30,000 have
returned home since Nov. 1. They complained to the Cairo news media
of insulting treatment by Iraqi employers, arbitrary dismissals and
steep cuts in the amounts of money they could send back to their
families.
   Makram Mohamed Ahmed, editor of the government-owned weekly
Al-Mussawar and a Mubarak confidant, said in an article that 975
bodies of Egyptian workers were brought back from Iraq since the
beginning of this year. Other reports placed the number at more
than 1,000.
   Ahmed said the number of dead ``may be normal in relation to the
number of Egyptians in Iraq.''
   Iraq said shortages of hard currency forced the dismissals of
some workers and delays of remittances by Egyptian employees of
their families. Reports estimate that the backlog of remittances
amounts to about $370 million.
   ``Remittances have been delayed and we know the reasons behind
this,'' Mubarak said. ``We are solving the problem with our Iraqi
brothers.''
   Last week Iraq announced it planned to free $50 million to
finance Egyptian remittances until the end of the year.

<HEAD>Switzerland Votes on Proposal To Scrap Its Army</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLARE NULLIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Neutral Switzerland decides in a referendum on
Sunday whether to disband the country's army.
   Even supporters admit the proposal is headed for certain defeat.
But if it gains close to 30 percent of the national vote, as some
pollsters predict, it is bound to send shock waves throughout the
military establishment.
   The government says Swiss neutrality and independence can be
guaranteed only if this mountain nation of 6.4 million people
retains a credible defense force. It urges voters to reject the
proposed constitutional amendment, which simply proclaims that
``Switzerland has no army.''
   The 625,000-member reserve force, which can be mobilized in less
than 48 hours, is rooted in centuries-old tradition.
   Although Switzerland has not fought a foreign war since 1515, it
can field more soldiers per square acre than any other country in
Europe. It has more artillery pieces than West Germany and half the
number of tanks France has.
   Every fit man must do military service, starting with 17 weeks
of basic training at age 20, followed by 13 call-ups of two or
three weeks until age 50.
   The proposal to abolish the army by the year 2000 was launched
three years ago when pacifists and left-wingers collected the
100,000 signatures required to force a popular vote under
Switzerland's form of direct democracy.
   The ``Switzerland Without an Army'' movement says this small
country would stand no chance in a war and abolishing the army
would set an example for global peace.
   Movement spokesman Andreas Gross, a 37-year-old political
scientist, concedes that traditionally conservative Swiss voters
will not accept the initiative, but he says the proposal has
injected a new dynamism into Swiss politics.
   Fierce debate on the issue filled newspaper letters' pages for
weeks. A sports magazine canvassed leading athletes on their views.
   ``Abolition of the army ... abolition of the police ...
abolition of the state. Anarchy and mob-law would take over,''
predicted Walter Krebs.
   ``Our existence is threatened by environmental catastrophy,
drugs and climate change. We cannot meet these threats with weapons
on the battlefield. ... We must realize that we do not face a real
enemy any more, we are our own enemy,'' countered Therese Dubach on
the same page of the Zurich daily, Tagesanzeiger.
   Reaction from abroad has also been varied, according to a survey
last Sunday by the newspaper SonntagsBlick.
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told the paper,
``Despite improved East-West relations, every country needs a sound
defense policy.''
   But Juri Soldatenko, a disarmament specialist in the Soviet
army, was quoted as saying, ``Switzerland has no enemies.
Therefore, abolition of the Swiss army would not have a
destabilizing influence on Europe.''
   ``No comment,'' was the official reaction from President Bush,
said the newspaper.
   Three of the four parties in the Swiss coalition government
oppose the proposal. The fourth, the Social Democrats, is taking no
stance on the issue.
   A second vote on Sunday will determine if speed limits should be
raised on major Swiss highways from 120 to 130 kilometers per hour
(75 to 81 mph) and on main roads from 80 to 100 kph (50 to 62 mph).
   The government urged voters to keep the present limits, citing
environmental and safety factors.

   The Fisher Park Golf Course is a bogy for
Linda Rodvold.
   Lousy golfers on the city-owned, par-3 course are endangering
the lives of Ms. Rodvold and her family, she contends. So she is
trying to shut the course down, using 1,087 golf balls collected on
their property over the past five years to buttress her case.
   ``We live in a war zone and we can't even defend ourselves,''
she said Friday.
   Although fairway property may be attractive to some people, Ms.
Rodvold said ducking duffers' slices and hooks is a big handicap.
Backyard barbecues and badminton are out of the question, she said.
   The problem is third hole at Fisher Park, a 9-hole course
nestled in a middle-class neighborhood of this central Washington
city.
   The Rodvolds' property sits across the street, less than 50
yards to the left of the green. Golfers teeing off on the 144-yard
hole routinely send balls careening into the family's yard, Ms.
Rodvold contends.
   Her scorecard so far includes 22 dents in family vehicles, seven
windows shattered on the house and garage, and three car
windshields destroyed.
   ``We've asked the prosecutor to close the course,'' she said.
``That is no place for a golf course to be, in a residential area.''
   There was no answer at the golf course or at the county
prosecutor's office Friday as many government agencies remained
closed for Thanksgiving.
   But Dave Flaherty, manager of the city park and recreation
department, said recently he does not believe the problem is as
serious as the Rodvolds maintain.
   ``We have tried to be accommodating,'' he said, adding that the
tee has been adjusted three times to try to solve the problem.
   Last spring, a city employee charted activity on the third hole
and found that of 2,356 tee shots, only six landed beyond the
6-foot fence ringing the course.
   ``One is too many if it kills one of us,'' Ms. Rodvold said. So
far, neither she, her husband or their 10-year-old son has been hit
by a ball.
   Last month, the family won a civil lawsuit against the golf
course, receiving $2,500 for property damage and $3,700 for the
disruption of ``their quietude of domicile.''
   Superior Court Judge Bruce P. Hanson did not rule the course a
public nuisance, though. So the 27-year-old course is still open
and golf balls keep landing in the Rodvolds' yard _ 128 times so
far this year, they say.
   Neighbors don't appear to be bothered. Kurt Weingarten, who
lives a block away from the Rodvolds on the edge of course, said he
finds about one ball a week on his property but hasn't suffered any
damage.
   ``I don't know anybody upset about it,'' he said. ``A lot of
people would rather have the park than something else come in.''
   Not the Rodvolds. They have asked county prosecutors to file
criminal charges against the city for 1,087 counts of reckless
endangerment and 1,087 counts of criminal trespass by people and
golf balls, she said. That's one count for every ball the family
has confiscated since 1985, often in the face of threats from their
irate owners, she said.
   The family bought the house in 1984 from Ms. Rodvold's
grandparents, unaware of the problem.
   ``They were here before the golf course and this house was here
before the golf course,'' she said.

   New Jersey Symphony musicians accepted a
last-minute management contract offer on Friday, the first day of a
strike, avoiding concert cancellations this weekend.
   The players' 12:01 a.m. strike deadline passed after an offer
was rejected Sunday. But intervention Wednesday by Gov. Thomas H.
Kean, who promised $200,000 in extra state aid, paved the way for
the offer Friday, said management spokeswoman Helen Paxton.
   She said board directors also promised to raise an extra
$200,000.
   In September, the musicians rejected an offer to reduce the
season from 29 to 22 weeks, reducing their income. But they agreed
to keep playing during negotiations.
   On Sunday, they spurned a one-year contract that would have
restored the 29 weeks but abolished two weeks' paid vacation and
frozen salaries at $690 a week.
   The players had asked for seasons of 32, 34 and 37 weeks over
three years, said Larry Clemmons, a member of the players'
negotiating team.
   The agreement calls for a guaranteed 28 weeks of work at $725 a
week, plus one week of recording, and restores the two weeks of
vacation under a one-year contract.
   New Jersey's premier symphonic ensemble has lately enjoyed a
financial and artistic resurgence after years on the wane.
   ``The areas that we addressed as those of greatest concern were
met,'' said Karl Herman, principal clarinetist and chairman of the
players association.
   ``The musicians deserve the settlement we have reached and it is
encouraging that they recognize the financial pressures we face,''
said board chairman Richard W. KixMiller.
   I. Philip Sipser, counsel to the orchestra, said the number of
weeks in the contract still was not enough to guarantee the players
a decent living. He said the average number of weeks worked by
comparable orchestras nationwide is 40 to 45 weeks.

   The most formidable challenge to
Lebanon's new president, Elias Hrawi, is just to stay alive.
   His predecessor, President Rene Mouawad, was assassinated by a
bomb blast Wednesday after just 17 days in office. Bachir Gemayel
was elected President on Aug. 23, 1982, and about three weeks
later, on Sept. 14, he was killed.
   Many of Lebanon's political leaders, both Christians and
Moslems, live under death threats from the rival factions engaged
in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war.
   Hrawi, a 64-year-old member of Parliament who is a wealthy
agricultural engineer with a degree in commerce, on Friday became
the 10th president of Lebanon since it gained independence from
France in 1943.
   He was elected by fellow Christian and Moslem legislators at a
session of Parliament held with the protection of Syrian security
forces at a hotel in the market town of Chtoura in Eastern Lebanon.
   Hrawi is a Maronite Catholic, as were Mouawad and Gemayel. He
has maintained warm ties with Lebanese Moslems and Syria, the main
power broker in Lebanon's civil war.
   His first official duty will be to lead government and political
officials in mourning at Mouawad's funeral Saturday in the slain
president's hometown of Zgorta in northern Lebanon.
   Mouawad and 23 other people were killed by a remote-controlled
bomb that ripped through the president's motorcade after an
Independence Day ceremony in Moslem west Beirut.
   He had been elected earlier this month by Parliament, but the
Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, called the election
unconstititional. Aoun also denounced the agreement reached by
Lebanese Christian and Moslem parliamentarians at a meeting last
month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in an effort to end the war.
   Rival Moslem and Christian Cabinets were established after
Presiden Amin Gemayel, a Maronite Catholic and brother of
assassinated Bachir Gemayel, left office when his term expired in
September 1988.
   Aoun leads the factional Christian government and rejected the
Taif agreement because it did not specifically provide for the
widthdrawal of some 40,000 Syrian troops.
   Aoun barred Mouawad from moving into the presidential palace in
Baabda on the outskirts of Beirut and is expected to keep Hrawi out
also.
   Hrawi was among the 59 members of Parliament members who
approved the Taif accord on Oct. 24.
   Hrawi was elected to Parliament in 1972 representing the eastern
Bekaa Valley's provincial capital of Zahleh. He served as minister
of public works from 1980 to 1982. Friends and political associates
say Hrawi is a patient, jovial man.
   Hrawi was born in Zahleh Sept. 4, 1925. He graduated from La
Sagesse College in Ashrafiyeh, eastern Beirut.
   He was married twice and the three children from his first
marriage, Rima, George and Roy, are all married.
   Hrawi's second marriage was to Mona Jammal, a Palestinian from
Jerusalem, and they have two daughters, Zalfa and Roula.

<HEAD>Proposed Anti-Terrorist Law Debated; Key Witness In Massacre Flees
To Miami</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Legislators debated a proposed
law Friday that would restrict union, peasant and human rights
groups by imposing long prison terms for many of their customary
activities.
   The rightist government and the military consider most such
organizations to be fronts for leftist rebels who have fought a
decade-long civil war.
   Also Friday, officials said a key witness in last week's
massacre of six Jesuit priests and two other people has fled to
Miami after hiding in the Spanish Embassy.
   Under the proposed laws, prison sentences of up to 20 years
would be possible for those who participate in peaceful sit-ins or
takeovers of buildings. People blocking traffic with marches or
demonstrations could be jailed for five years.
   In a revision of another section of the penal code, the proposal
would provide prison terms of up to 30 years for murder,
kidnapping, armed assault or sabotage ``intended to provoke a state
of terror.''
   A provision that could affect the press, prescribes sentences of
up to four years for ``spreading ... propaganda that subverts the
public order.''
   A U.S. Embassy spokesman said a witness in the Nov. 16 massacre
has left the country.
   ``A departure was worked out in conjunction with the Salvadoran
government and French, Spanish, U.S. and British officials,'' said
embassy spokesman Jeff Brown.
   The head of the Jesuit order in Central America, Jose Maria
Tojeira, identified the witness as Lucia Barrera Cerna. Officials
said she had been staying in the Spanish Embassy since the incident.
   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado quoted the woman, who had
worked as a housekeeper at Central American University, as saying
she saw men ``dressed in military uniforms'' killing the Jesuits,
their housekeeper and her daughter.
   Jesuit officials said the woman left Thursday for Miami. The
judge in charge of the case would not let The Associated Press see
the statement she made before leaving.
   U.S. Ambassador William Walker had said the United States would
do everything possible to obtain the testimony of witnesses and
would offer them protection if necessary.
   The National Assembly, controlled by President Alfredo
Cristiani's rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance and its
allies, passed several key articles of the proposed law Thursday
and debate continued Friday.
   No reports of the legislative action appeared in Salvadoran
media, which have been heavily censored since the rebels brought
the war to the capital two weeks ago.
   Ricardo Alvarenga Valdivieso, president of the assembly, denied
that the law would cripple the opposition.
   ``I don't believe it could limit the actions of anyone,'' he
told reporters.
   Cristiani's government proposed the measure weeks after he took
office, then put it aside in the face of domestic and foreign
criticism.
   When he learned the proosals had been revived, Lutheran Bishop
Medardo Gomez, a member of a national committee seeking
negotiations to end the war, said democracy in El Salvador had been
``destroyed.''
   ``All we can do now is try to protect our people and our
church,'' he said.
   His church is one of those raided by security forces in the past
two weeks. More than a dozen Lutheran church workers have been
arrested.

   A bomb squad found a time bomb in a
school bag taken from a Saudi jumbo jet on Friday and said only a
loose battery wire kept it from blowing up the Boeing 747 over the
Arabian Sea with 248 people aboard.
   Airport security officers said authorities ordered the jet to
land in Karachi Thursday night following a $1.5 million extortion
threat.
   ``It was a high explosive and would have destroyed the terminal
building of Karachi Airport, in addition to the plane,'' said a
commander of the paramilitary Karachi Airport Security Force.
   He, like most other officials, spoke on the condition of
anonymity. They did not disclose the weight of the device or other
specifications.
   Security officers said they questioned all those aboard. They
made no arrests and declined to say if they had any suspects or
whether any group claimed responsibility.
   Saudi Arabian Airlines Flight 367 was bound from Islamabad,
capital of Pakistan, to Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
   Security officials said a cab driver delivered an envelope to an
Islamabad Airport security officer soon after the jet took off
around 6 p.m. Thursday.
   Inside was an unsigned note threatening to blow up the plane
unless a demand for $1.5 million was met, they said.
   The aircraft was over the sea when the Karachi control tower
relayed the threat and ordered it to land at Karachi, officers
said. It touched down shortly after 8 p.m., they said.
   After the airliner was emptied of passengers and luggage,
officers found the bomb early Friday in an untagged, unclaimed
school bag.
   ``We have recovered a bomb in a bag which was not tagged,'' said
a security force officer, who gave the single name Ashraf.
   ``We have handed it over to the bomb disposal squad to get
details on the type of explosive.''
   Authorities said the discovery initially was kept secret to help
their investigation.
   They said the bomb was set to go off at 7:20 p.m. when the
aircraft was over water, but that a battery apparently had jarred
loose, detaching a wire.
   Officials said they could not immediately reconcile the
extortion note with the bomb's apparently having been rigged to go
off automatically.
   Col. Noor Khan of the Islamabad Airport Security Force said it
was unclear how the bomb got past security there.
   ``It's not understood how they did it. Everything is there and
working,'' he said of security devices.
   Baggage for international flights from Islamabad normally is
inspected personally by customs agents and then screened by X-ray.
   Passengers with boarding cards pass through a metal detector and
undergo a body search. Carry-on luggage is X-rayed a second time.
   A terrorist bomb exploded last Dec. 21 aboard a Pan Am Boeing
747 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people. Investigators
said the bomb was hidden in a cassette-recorder.

<DATELINE>WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The South African military presence in
Namibia has ended, with the withdrawal of the last 1,500 troops
from the territory, the defense force said Friday.
   Also Friday, a U.N. official said Namibian guerrillas are to
close the rest of their bases in neighboring Angola over the
weekend.
   South Africa has ruled Namibia, also called South-West Africa,
since capturing it from Germany in 1915, and has agreed to a
U.N.-supervised transition to independence.
   More than 200 South African defense force personnel remain in
the country to perform civilian work as doctors, air traffic
controllers and administrators, the defense force said.
   But the combat troops, who fought their last battle in April
against guerrillas of the South-West Africa People's Organization,
or SWAPO, left the territory in two convoys Thursday night.
   SWAPO won the most seats in an election early this month for a
constituent assembly to write a constitution for the country,
expected to become independent early next year. Under the U.N.
plan, South Africa was allowed to keep 1,500 troops in the
territory until one week after the election results were certified.
It missed the deadline by two days.
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said SWAPO, which waged war against
South African rule for 23 years, was expected to close its
remaining bases in neighboring Angola and return to Namibia its
last group of 300 guerrilla fighters still in Angola.
   ``It is anticipated that those bases will be closed this
weekend,'' said Eckhard. He said the guerrillas' military equipment
would be turned over to the Angolan government.
   Eckhard said U.N. officials were visiting the SWAPO bases in
southern Angola.
   Most SWAPO guerrillas returned to Namibia as unarmed civilians
before the Nov. 7-11 elections.

<HEAD>Moslem to Urge Tolerance for Rushdie in Middle East</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent Moslem said Friday he will make a
Middle East lecture tour to campaign for lifting of Iran's death
threat against British author Salman Rushdie.
   ``A price on his head is below the dignity of the Iranian
government _ it belongs to gangster movies and westerns,'' said
Hesham El-Essawy, chairman of the Islamic Society for the Promotion
of Religious Tolerance.
   Essawy, a London dentist, helped found the society in 1982. He
said it has a membership of scholars and leading Moslems in Britain
as well as non-Moslems committed to tolerance.
   The London newspaper The Independent quoted Essawy as saying the
Rushdie affair harmed Britain's Moslem community by encouraging a
backlash that in turn stimulated extremism among Moslems.
   He intends to speak throughout Egypt and the Persian Gulf states
in February and hopes to visit Iran if its government guarantees
his safety.
   Essawy said he would quote from the Koran, Islam's holy book, to
support his argument that Moslems should ignore Rushdie's novel,
``The Satanic Verses,'' which some Moslem religious leaders
denounce as blasphemous.
   ``The Koran has verses that actually fit the situation exactly:
if unbelievers or hypocrites mock or insult the word of God, do not
sit with them until they talk about something else,'' Essawy said.
   He said he also was incensed by the novel, but that Iran's late
leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, should not have called for
Rushdie's death last Feb. 14.
   Khomeini's action drove the 42-year-old Indian-born writer into
hiding. Two Iranian clerics offered rewards totaling $5.2 million
for Rushdie's death.
   At least 19 people were killed in riots over the book in India
and Pakistan.

<HEAD>Inspections of Abortion Clinics to Resume Next Year in Illinois</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A settlement rolling back some Illinois
restrictions on abortion clinics bars the state from taking certain
steps to limit access to the procedure in the future, a party to
the agreement said Friday.
   Under the settlement, access to abortions could not be
restricted ``either by materially increasing the cost of the
procedure or materially reducing the number of facilities without
resulting in more than a marginal increase in safety,'' said Jay A.
Miller, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of
Illinois.
   Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan and the Illinois ACLU
agreed to the settlement Wednesday to resolve a lawsuit by Rockford
physician Dr. Richard Ragsdale, who objected to regulations
requiring abortion clinics to be equipped and staffed like small
hospitals.
   The U.S. Supreme Court had been prepared to hear arguments early
next month in the case, which some abortion opponents hoped might
be used to help overturn the landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion.
   Clinics that perform abortions on women more than 18 weeks
pregnant still will have to comply with the stringent state rules,
which are designed to offset the higher risk of ending a pregnancy
relatively late, Miller said.
   But clinics that perform abortions on women during the first 18
weeks of pregnancy _ upward of 95 percent of abortions _ will be
freed from ``stupid kinds'' of regulations that don't protect
patients' health under the settlement, he said.
   Jerry Bruce, a spokesman for a coalition of anti-abortion
groups, called the settlement ``unconscionable and
unconstitutional'' and said heading off a Supreme Court decision on
the case was ``a total sellout.''
   Ragsdale had maintained that the state regulations were a veiled
attempt to hinder women's access to abortion. Illinois had argued
that the rules were necessary to protect women's health.
   One requirement stricken under the settlement mandated that
patients receive counseling about birth control and adoption and
that counselors be people who derive no profit from abortions,
Miller said.
   Also changed was a requirement that all abortion clinics go
through a public hearing process and obtain a ``certificate of
need'' from the state verifying that they do not duplicate similar
services in their areas. Clinics performing abortions before the
18th week of pregnancy would be freed from that requirement under
the settlement, Miller said.
   Dr. Bernard J. Turnock, director of the Illinois Department of
Public Health, said Wednesday that state officials hope to resume
inspections of abortion clinics next year to make sure they adhere
to the proposed new state regulations.
   ``We'll ... be in these facilities four times a year at a
minimum to assure their continued compliance,'' said Turnock, who
noted that officials had been barred from inspecting abortion
clinics since 1985, when Ragsdale won a preliminary injunction.

   Federal health officials said Friday they have
found ``statistically significant'' evidence that the nutritional
supplement L-tryptophan causes a painful blood disorder now
reported in 427 cases and at least one death.
   ``The studies appear to have very strongly linked the actual
taking of these tablets and capsules with the disease,'' Centers
for Disease Control researcher Dr. Henry Falk said. It now ``seems
extraordinarily likely'' that taking L-tryptophan causes the blood
disorder, he said.
   The disorder, known as eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome, brings an
abnormally high number of white blood cells called eosinophils, and
causes severe muscle pain, or myalgia.
   L-tryptophan is a building block of protein, which is found
naturally in a number of foods. Pills and capsules containing doses
of the substance are taken by some people for insomnia, depression,
premenstrual syndrome or weight control.
   Since reports of L-tryptophan and the blood disorder surfaced in
New Mexico several weeks ago, hundreds of case reports have come
into the CDC, with most cases occurring after July of this year,
Falk said.
   A 58-year-old New York woman who died from the disorder in
September is the first confirmed fatality in the outbreak, and
several other deaths are still under investigation in other states,
Falk said.
   The CDC report said the New York woman had been taking 5 to 6
grams of L-tryptophan daily.
   The Atlanta-based CDC, in its weekly report, cited studies in
New Mexico and Minnesota which ``establish a statistically
significant association'' between the product and the disease.
   In New Mexico, each of 12 blood-disorder patients studied from
May 1-Nov. 11 had used L-tryptophan. In Minnesota, another 12 cases
were investigated, and again, all had used L-tryptophan.
   The studies show a ``causal relationship,'' said Falk, director
of the CDC's Environmental Hazards and Health Effects Division.
``We don't yet know what exactly about those tablets and capsules
has caused the disease.''
   The disease has now been reported in 43 states and the District
of Columbia. The number of L-tryptophan users nationwide remains
unknown, but it appears to be large, Falk said.
   Some of the first potential cases of L-tryptophan-related EMS
could not be confirmed. But all state health departments now have a
detailed definition of the disease, and states are reporting new
cases daily, Falk said.
   Minnesota researchers, in a recent follow-up study, found that
20 of 30 EMS cases were among patients using brands of L-tryptophan
from one particular manufacturer. Such details can be ``a strong
lead'' in the investigation, Falk said _ but he noted that there
are numerous brands of L-tryptophan, and many can come from a
single source, so any number of brands could be involved.
   It appears that most of the L-tryptophan sold in the United
States comes from four or five sources in Japan, Falk said.
   The Food and Drug Administration last week announced its
intention to seek a nationwide recall of all L-tryptophan products
in which the substance is the sole or major component. The FDA
previously warned consumers to stop taking it.

   A woman trying to stop a confrontation
between her son and four men over an alleged drug deal was shot and
killed Friday in the house where she cared for 10 foster children.
   The children were not injured; most were sleeping during the 2
a.m. shooting. The woman's son and a man with whom he was arguing
were wounded, authorities said.
   Moses Williams, 36, will be charged in the death of Elsie
Jackson, 59, who was shot in the chest, police said.
   Her son, Darryl Ross, 25, was in guarded condition at Aultman
Hospital.
   Mrs. Jackson was shot when she tried to persuade Williams to
leave her house, according to Stark County sheriff's deputies.
   The hospital referred questions about Williams' condition to the
sheriff's department, which said only that Williams had undergone
surgery.
   Three men were charged with complicity to aggravated burglary
and face court hearings Monday, said Bruce Umpleby, sheriff's chief
deputy.
   One witness said that several people were firing at once, but
police would not confirm that.
   Williams and three companions allegedly went to the home to find
Ross because they were seeking vengeance for a soured drug deal,
deputies said.
   Ross and Williams shot each other, sheriff's Deputy Capt. James
Shannon said. Ross also was stabbed several times. Police did not
say whether any charges were being considered against Ross.
   Williams fled with his companions after the shootings and soon
showed up at the hospital, police said.
   The 10 foster children, whose ages ranged from 9 months to 16
years, were placed in other foster homes by the county Department
of Human Services, the agency said.

<TEXT>
   Dissident playwright Vaclav Havel
and ex-Communist leader Alexander Dubcek hugged and drank Bohemia
rose champagne Friday night to greet the end of the nation's two
decades of gloom and despair.
   In a crackling day of political drama, Havel and Dubcek walked
hand-in-hand into the jammed Magic Lantern theater.
   The two symbols of Czechoslovak freedom met on a stage of
history, as the news of mass resignation of the entire Politburo
hit the downtown Prague theater, where an opposition news
conference was in progress.
   ``Long live free Czechoslovakia!'' Havel toasted to the jubilant
crowd which jumped to its feet in joy.
   Earlier, before sheer happiness and an overwhelming sense of
unity flooded the entire hall, some differences between the two
father figures of Czechoslovak independence still remained.
   ``I do not share the opinion that socialism is unreformable,''
Dubcek said when asked about the political future of his country on
the eve of imminent change in the Communist leadership.
   ``The party must be more open,'' he insisted.
   Dubcek led the ``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed by Soviet-led
armies of five Warsaw Pact countries in August 1968, after the
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev claimed counterrevolution threatened
socialism in Czechoslovakia.
   ``I used to pass myself for a socialist, but I have stopped
using this word 15 years ago,'' Havel countered.
   ``This word completely lost its meaning in the Czech language,''
he said. ``It became a magic spell with which the bureaucratic
power would protect itself.''
   For 13 years Havel was persecuted as a leader of underground
dissent. He spent four years in prison and the rest of his time
under police surveillance.
   ``This can be different in other countries. But I do not use the
word (socialism) anymore. What I want is social justice, there are
many examples to learn from,'' Havel explained.
   Crowds outside the theater hugged and kissed each other,
emotions choking the throats of youngsters who stood up at the
beginning of this peaceful revolution.
   ``We are all tired and exhausted and we hope the society will
take away this heavy load as soon as possible,'' said Igor Chaun, a
pony-tailed representative of the students' strike committee,
speaking in the theater.
   Students went on nationwide strike Nov. 18, the day after police
beat peaceful demonstrators in downtown Prague, sparkling off a
wave of massive protests finally leading to the Politburo's
resignation.
   In spite of 40 years of almost continuous oppression,
Czechoslovaks seemed to have reached a spontaneous political
consensus overnight.
   ``We thank the students for returning time and history to this
country,'' Havel said, his words drowning in cheers and tears on
stage.
   ``Nobody gave this to us as a Christmas present, we have have
taken that one ourselves,'' Michal Horacek, a lyricist, added from
the wings.
   ``Finally, we can respect ourselves.''

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Iran-Contra Trial of Former CIA Man Fernandez</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: INSERTS 13th graf: ``Thornburgh said,'' with comment from attorney
general</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETE YOST</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge threw out the Iran-Contra case
against a former CIA station chief Friday, two days after Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh barred courtroom use of classified
information on CIA facilities and programs in Central America.
   U.S. District Court Judge Claude Hilton said criminal charges
against Joseph Fernandez focusing on his help to Oliver North's
secret Contra resupply network must be dropped.
   Classified material the government refuses to divulge ``is
essential to this defendant,'' said the judge.
   Associate independent counsel Laurence Shtasel asked Hilton for
more time to work out a compromise with the CIA to preserve part of
the case, but the judge refused, saying his rulings about
classified information in the Fernandez matter ``have been known''
for ``quite some time.'' They were issued in July.
   Iran-Contra prosecutors will try to revive the case in the U.S.
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., where they filed a notice of
appeal following the session before Hilton in Alexandria, Va.
   Shtasel complained that Thornburgh and U.S. intelligence
agencies ``have made bringing this case to trial extremely
difficult.''
   The office of independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has called the
data the government is protecting ``fictional secrets'' that are
widely known to the public.
   The information protected by an affidavit Thornburgh filed
Wednesday concerns the locations of three CIA facilities, including
stations in El Salvador and Honduras. The government also is
refusing to allow details to surface in court about three CIA
programs in Costa Rica, the country where Fernandez was CIA station
chief.
   Fernandez's defense in part is that some of his activities on
behalf of North were intertwined with initiatives by Costa Rica to
protect itself from possible invasion by Nicaragua. Fernandez
asserts, for example, that he did not lie when he told the CIA
inspector general that an airstrip built by the North network was
an initiative of the Costa Rican government.
   North, the former White House aide, is appealing his conviction
on three charges: destroying government documents, aiding and
abetting in the obstruction of Congress and accepting an illegal
gratuity.
   Last July 24, the day Fernandez's trial was to begin, Hilton
rejected a last-minute proposal by the Justice Department and
independent counsel to substitute numbers for the CIA facilities
and to drop part of one charge dealing with an airstrip to avoid
delving into the programs.
   The Justice Department delayed the Fernandez case for four
months by seeking to appeal Hilton's rulings, but was turned away
by the appeals court in Richmond. Relations between the Justice
Department and Walsh's office worsened during the delay, and the
independent counsel's office wasn't shown the attorney general's
affidavit until it was filed in court.
   Thornburgh said in a statement Friday, ``I continue to believe
that this case can be tried without compromising the defendant's
right to a fair trial or the national security of this country.''
He said ``the independent counsel and I agree that the district
court's earlier rejection of substitutions and alternatives to the
release of classified material constituted reversible error.''
   Fernandez was indicted on four charges, including obstructing
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by the CIA inspector general
and the presidentially appointed Tower Commission and making false
statements.
   The retired CIA officer called Hilton's decision ``wonderful''
but said he was troubled that CIA operatives performing what he
said were legitimate duties could be subjected to a ``politically
motivated prosecution.''
   ``That is a chilling message to people who put their lives on
the line every day,'' Fernandez said.
   He said national security ``absolutely'' would have been
endangered by disclosure at a trial of the classified information
the government is keeping secret, which he said involves
intelligence sources.
   Fernandez characterized as ``onerous and unnecessary'' a
question by a reporter who asked whether he had engaged in
graymail, the practice of trying to force as much classified
information as possible into a case in an attempt to scuttle the
prosecution.
   The secret material at issue ``is the guts of the defense's
case,'' said Fernandez's lawyer, Thomas Wilson.
   Shtasel told the judge that a possible compromise with the CIA
might involve ``narrowing charges as well as'' drafting ``findings
against the government'' which would summarize some of the evidence
Fernandez wants to use in his defense.
   But anything ``short of using the information would essentially
be a trial that is scripted beforehand ... by the independent
counsel,'' said Fernandez's lawyer, Wilson. ``That is not what the
Constitution contemplates. The defense would not be able to
cross-examine the government's witnesses effectively.''

<HEAD>Cold Grips Northeast; Snow in the West</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Record cold followed in the wake of a record snowstorm across
the Northeast Friday, while storms in the West dumped up to a foot
of snow from the Cascades to the northern Rockies.
   A Thanksgiving Day storm left snow piled 10 to 14 inches deep
from South Weymouth to Cape Cod, Mass., and blanketed Providence,
R.I., with 8 inches of snow, a record for any day in November.
Earlier Thursday, the storm left 4 to 8 inches of snow from
Virginia to Connecticut.
   Temperatures then plunged into the teens and single digits
across much of the middle and northern Atlantic Coast, with subzero
readings reported in Maine.
   Friday morning lows of 1 degree at Hartford, Conn., 3 degrees at
Portland, Maine, and 6 at Providence, R.I., were records for the
month of November. The low of minus 5 degrees at Concord, N.H., was
their coldest reading of record for so early in the season.
   Record lows were set or tied in 12 Northeast cities Friday
morning. The early morning low for the Lower 48 was 14 degrees
below zero at Houlton, Maine.
   In the West, a cold front produced snow from the Sierra of
California and Nevada to the mountains of Idaho and Wyoming. Eight
inches fell Thursday night at Nevada's Sugar Bowl ski area near
Donner Summit, and Yellowstone Park in Wyoming got up to 13 inches
overnight.
   A winter storm watch was in effect in the Sierra.
   ``In any good storm, it's not unusual to get a couple of feet of
snow and this one looks pretty good,'' said Dick Fuller of the
National Weather Service.
   Snow advisories were in effect for the mountains of southeast
Idaho, the northern and western mountains of Wyoming, and
elevations above 7,000 feet in northern Utah, with up to 8 inches
expected.
   An advisory for snow and blowing snow was in effect for the
northern and central mountains of Colorado, where 4 to 8 inches
were expected.
   Westerly winds off the Pacific Ocean carried rain over the
northern and central Pacific Coast, which turned to snow over the
coastal mountains of Washington and Oregon.
   Up to 8 inches blanketed the Cascade Mountains of Oregon
Thursday night and another 4 to 8 inches could fall.
   Strong and gusty winds blew across the southern and central
Plains and the mountains of southwest Texas. Gusts of 46 mph were
reported at Guadelupe Pass, Texas, and gusts around Casper, Wyo.,
reached 50 mph.
   Strong northerly winds ushering cold air into the Great Lakes
produced snow squalls along the shores of Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario Thursday night and Friday. Up to 6 inches fell in Ashtabula
County in northeast Ohio and more than 5 inches blanketed
Watertown, N.Y.
   Temperatures were still below freezing at midday Friday across
much of the area from Minnesota through the Great Lakes to New
England, with teens in northern Minnesota and Upper Michigan.
   Temperatures were warming into the 50s and 60s in the
south-central states, with readings in the 70s in the lower Rio
Grande Valley of Texas, and in the 60s and 70s across the Florida
Peninsula and in Southern California and southern Arizona.

   A death mask of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, founder of
the Soviet Union, is being offered for sale on Monday and is
expected to fetch up to $12,500, Phillips auction house said.
   The company announced Friday that the gray plaster relic will be
included during a sale of Russian 20th-century and avant-garde art.
   Lenin was 53 when he died at Gorki on Jan. 21, 1924, after
suffering two strokes. His remains are preserved and on display in
his tomb in Moscow's Red Square.
   Several plaster casts were taken of his face the night he died,
apparently by sculptor Sergei Merkurov, who is credited for the
mask in the sale catalog.
   The auctioneers will not disclose who sent the mask for sale.

<HEAD>Red Square Pilot Under Investigation For Attempted Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mathias Rust, who served time in a
Soviet jail for landing a plane on Red Square, is under
investigation for attempted murder after allegedly stabbing a nurse
who resisted his advances, law officials said Friday.
   Officials heading the investigation are ``convinced that Rust
committed the deed with malicious intent,'' said a spokesman for
Hamburg's Justice Ministry.
   Rust, 21, is in a Hamburg jail, said the spokesman, who refused
to give his name. If convicted, Rust could be sentenced to up to 15
years in prison.
   On Thursday, Rust turned himself in to police hours after
fleeing the Hamburg-area hospital where he was working as an
orderly under the federal Civilian Service, a pacifist alternative
to compulsory military service.
   Police said Rust pulled an 18-year-old student nurse into a
changing room, locked the door and tried to kiss her. When she
resisted, she was stabbed twice in the stomach, police said. They
identified her only as Stefanie.
   They said she underwent surgery right after the stabbing, but it
was unclear Friday night how severe the injuries were. West German
newspapers, without citing sources, said her condition was serious.
   Rust made world headlines when he piloted a borrowed Cessna
across more than 500 miles of heavily defended Soviet territory on
May 28, 1987, and landed in downtown Moscow.
   His stunt led to a shakeup in the Soviet Defense Ministry. He
was sentenced to a four-year prison term in September 1987 for
violating international air safety regulations, illegal entry into
the Soviet Union and ``malicious hooliganism.''
   Soviet authorities pardoned him in August 1988 and expelled him
to West Germany.
   He said in an interview at his home in suburban Wedel, west of
Hamburg, he chose the Civilian Service because he opposed violence.

<HEAD>Vincent Sardi Gets His Famous Restaurant Back</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vincent Sardi can take back the legendary
theater district restaurant he sold to a Broadway producer in 1986,
a judge ruled Friday.
   The new owner, Sardi's Inc., and its president, Ivan Bloch,
failed to make the monthly purchase payments and Sardi can
foreclose on the note he holds, said trial-level State Supreme
Court Justice Burton Sherman.
   Sardi sold his West 44th Street restaurant to Bloch and his
group for $6.2 million with $1 million cash down. Monthly payments
were to include the remaining principal plus interest, a consulting
fee for Sardi and a fee to keep him from opening another restaurant
within five years.
   After one default in April, the debt was restructured. In July,
Bloch's group failed to make a required monthly payment of
$136,262.38 and Sardi sued.
   Bloch's group opposed the foreclosure, saying Sardi should have
renegotiated with them again since he was aware of financial
setbacks stemming from a decline in the Broadway theater industry,
according to Sherman.
   The judge said Bloch accused Sardi of trying to grab the
restaurant back because this theater season has the potential to be
Broadway's best in years.
   Sardi is ``not under any legal obligation to renegotiate the
terms of the note with the defendant,'' Sherman said.
   Bloch's lawyer, Howard Rubin, said he hadn't discussed the
ruling with his client.
   Open since 1922, Sardi's is a favorite hangout for Broadway
stars and star-gazers. Located in the heart of the theater
district, the restaurant's walls are adorned with caricatures of
stage greats.

<HEAD>Say Two Ringleaders of Medellin Drug Cartel Elude Police</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two kingpins of the notorious Medellin
cocaine cartel managed to escape during a police raid on their
operations center in a northern jungle and have eluded air and
ground searches, officials said Friday.
   President Virgilio Barco's office said police killed two cartel
gunmen and wounded 10 others in shootouts during the sweep
Thursday. Fifty-five people, including five women, were arrested at
the jungle site and three nearby ranches, said the office
communique. It reported no police casualties.
   Police seized 10 automobiles, two boats, weapons, ammunition and
communications equipment during the raid about 110 miles north of
Bogota, the communique said.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo said the police operation was
such a surprise that one of the cartel's kingpins, Pablo Escobar,
fled wearing only his pants.
   National police Gen. Octavio Vargas said it was believed that
Jorge Luis Ochoa, another major leader of the Medellin cartel, also
was at the operations center when police attacked.
   He said helicopter gunships and warplanes crisscrossed the area
in case the fugitives tried to escape by air, and ground patrols
were making a methodical search of the jungle district some 70
miles east of Medellin.
   Vargas, in a broadcast interview, said the raid was the result
of a tip from a Colombian citizen and indicated the information was
in response to a reward of nearly $300,000 offered for clues
leading to Escobar's arrest.
   He said the raid was carried out by a special anti-drug strike
force created after drug traffickers received advance warnings
about planned actions by regular police units.
   The strike force, backed by warplanes and army troops, was not
told where it was headed or who might be captured, according to
Vargas.
   He said a fierce gunbattle developed as helicopters carrying the
strike force landed and the police charged. Escobar, and perhaps
Ochoa, were able to escape as policemen fought with dozens of
gunmen, Vargas said.
   He did not say how police knew that either Escobar or Ochoa were
at the center, but El Tiempo quoted strike force commanders as
saying clothing was found with documents belonging to Escobar.
   It said a shirtless Escobar was seen running into the jungle. A
reporter and photographer from El Tiempo went with the police on
the raid.
   The presidential communiqhe said cartel's operation center was
in the state of Antioquia, at the junction of the Cocorna and
Magadalena rivers.
   If Escobar and Ochoa were at the center or main ranch, it would
have been the closest security forces came to capturing them since
the government declared war on traffickers more than three months
ago.
   Barco made a war declaration hours after traffickers
assassinated a presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Galan, at a Bogota
election rally Aug. 18.

   A baby found wrapped in a garbage bag on a snowy
sidewalk began recovering from hypothermia Friday and the family
who found him said they would give ``many thanks'' during their
postponed Thanksgiving celebration.
   ``It was a beautiful Thanksgiving after all because we saved a
baby's life,'' said Floscelia Saunders, whose nephew Robert
Saunders, 31, tore through several bags of garbage to find the
infant.
   The baby, estimated at about 2 hours old, was dumped in a
plastic bag in the stack of garbage on a snowy curb outside the
apartment building where Mrs. Saunders lives.
   Another abandoned infant was discovered Thursday in a cold
apartment in New Haven, Conn. The girl, about 3 weeks old, was in
fair condition Friday at the Hospital of St. Raphael.
   A third abandoned infant died from exposure in West Virginia,
authorities there said Friday. The 11-pound, full-term baby was
less than five hours old when it was found dead in a plastic bag
outside an apartment complex Wednesday. Authorities were searching
for the mother, said Ravenswood police Lt. W.G. Sinnett.
   Police were also trying to find the mother of the child found in
New York.
   The infant, called Baby Bob in honor of Saunders, suffered from
exposure to the cold, but was in stable condition Friday at Lincoln
Hospital, said Jasmine Collazo, a hospital spokeswoman.
   The newborn's temperature dropped well below normal and did not
register on a thermometer, said Dr. Jonathan Golden. A few more
hours on the freezing sidewalk would have been fatal, he said.
   New York City had its first white Thanksgiving in 51 years. The
4.7 inches of snow was a record for Nov. 23 and for Thanksgiving
Day. The day's high was 31 degrees.
   The boy was born after a full-term pregnancy and weighed 5
pounds, 5 ounces, when he got to the hospital, Golden said.
   The baby was discovered after two children, Parod Mallory, 13,
and his sister Felicia, 4, heard wailing and traced the cries to
the garbage pile, said police Sgt. Raymond O'Donnell.
   The children alerted Saunders, who was walking up the block to
join his aunt for Thanksgiving dinner.
   ``I ripped through all the bags and at the bottom of one bag
there was another bag with the baby,'' said Saunders. ``I yelled up
to the women to get the cops and an ambulance.''
   ``We were all so excited _ you would have thought we all gave
birth to the baby ourselves,'' Mrs. Saunders said.
   ``This all happened just before we were going to sit down before
dinner,'' she said. ``We coudn't eat then because it was a terrible
thing to see the baby that way. But we'll give many thanks today.''
   Police found the Connecticut baby in a vacant apartment after
receiving an anonymous telephone tip. A police spokesman, Detective
Robert Coffey, said he didn't know how long the child had been
alone, or how cold it was.
   Coffey said police determined the call came from an acquaintance
of the baby's mother. He said police were trying to find the
mother, whom he declined to identify.

   Here is the legal status of key figures in the
Iran-Contra affair:
   _Oliver North, former National Security Council aide, found
guilty at a jury trial May 4 of three felonies _ aiding and
abetting the obstruction of Congress, destroying official documents
and accepting an illegal gratuity _ and sentenced to two years
probation, fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service. He is appealing the conviction, the fine and
probation while serving the community service in an anti-drug
program.
   _Robert McFarlane, former national security adviser, pleaded
guilty March 11, 1988, to four misdemeanors of withholding
information from Congress by denying that the NSC staff was
soliciting support for the Contras' military activities and helping
move supplies to the rebels and denying that he knew anything about
third-country financing of the Contras. He was placed on two years'
probation and fined $20,000. He also was ordered to complete 200
hours of community service during his probation.
   _Richard Secord, a retired Air Force major general, pleaded
guilty Nov. 8 to lying to congressional investigators when he said
he wasn't aware of any money that went to the benefit of North from
the maze of companies known as ``the Enterprise'' which Secord had
used in the Iran-Contra affair.
   _Carl ``Spitz'' Channell, pleaded guilty April 29, 1987 to using
his non-profit National Endowment for the Preservation of Liberty
to raise more than $2 million to buy weapons for the Nicaraguan
rebels. Sentenced to two years probation for conspiring to deraud
the Treasury of taxes due on the money raised with North's
assistance.
   _Richard Miller, head of a Washington public relations firm who
pleaded guilty May 6, 1987 to conspiring to defraud the Internal
Revenue Service of taxes on contributions used to supply military
aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Sentenced to two years probation.
   _John Poindexter, facing trial Jan. 22, accused of conspiracy,
two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts of making false
statements in connection with Reagan administration assistance to
the Contras and a November 1985 shipment of Hawk missiles to Iran.
Has issued subpoena for records and testimony of former President
Reagan.
   _Albert Hakim, Iranian-born businessman who with Secord ran
``the Enterprise,'' pleaded guilty Tuesday to a misdemeanor of
aiding and abetting in supplementing North's income by paying for a
security fence at North's home. Hakim will be sentenced Feb. 1 and
could face up to a year in prison. Also, a company he set up, Lake
Resources, pleaded guilty to theft of government property in
connection with Iran arms sale money diverted from the U.S.
government, a felony that could carry a fine of up to $500,000.
   _Joseph Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica,
charged in June 1988 with obstruction and making false statements
in connection with his assistance to North's Contra resupply
network. The judge in the case said the charges must be dismissed
due to the attorney general's ban on the use of classified material
Fernandez needs for his defense. Iran-Contra prosecutors are
appealing.

   Shoppers began their holiday buying wave on Friday, flocking to
stores across the country to start retailers' biggest selling
season of the year by bargain-hunting, browsing or seeking Santa
Claus.
   Suburban malls and downtown shopping districts in many cities
and towns were jammed with shoppers eager for hard-to-find Nintendo
video games, electronic gear, costume jewelry, accessories,
perfumes and novelty gifts.
   Many merchants expanded their hours, anticipating a crush of
business on a day that traditionally is their busiest of the year.
   Despite earlier openings, managers in many areas arrived to find
customers lined up waiting for stores to open, a hopeful sign in
what has been a so-so year for retailers.
   ``It's wall-to-wall people,'' said Dianne Haynes, customer
service representative at the Oxmoor Center in Louisville, Ky.
``They're definitely shopping and buying; everybody's got packages.
We can't move in here.''
   Evon Wright, 35, waited in a crowd for stores to open at Valley
Fair Shopping Center in San Jose, Calif. ``My husband is staying
home with the kids today,'' she said. ``It's freedom at any price.
All the women worked hard yesterday and now it's a day for us.''
   In nearby Santa Cruz, residents flocked to the opening of a tent
pavilion at the site of a downtown mall devastated by the Oct. 17
earthquake. ``We just felt we must support Santa Cruz and see it
come out of the rubble and live again,'' shopper Louise Bagnall
said.
   Bob Gilley, manager of the Sears, Roebuck and Co. store at Merle
Hay Mall in Des Moines, Iowa, said: ``Nintendo is selling awful
good and camcorders are blowing out. Anything in the electric
(department) is selling very well.''
   The Santa Claus at Raleigh, N.C.'s Crabtree Valley Mall said
most of the several dozen children who had confided their requests
to him Friday morning asked for Nintendo items.
   A few crowd-stoppers fell into the gag gift category. Pots of
Rock 'n Flowers _ colorful, plastic flowers that ``dance'' to music
_ entertained customers at the entrances to a number of stores.
   Rita Eisenberg, spokeswoman for John Wanamaker's department
store in downtown Philadelphia, said Yuppy Puppy products appeared
popular. For $2 to $65, the pet products include Haute Canine
gourmet popcorn and bagels, chewable sneakers and french fries,
faux pet pearls and gold chains.
   Heavy markdowns at some troubled stores triggered waves of
bargain hunters. The six B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores in New
York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania drew hordes of people to
liquidation sales. Altman is virtually going out of business _
leaving only its Cincinnati store open _ because its financially
ailing parent Hooker Corp. couldn't find a buyer for the chain.
   The morning crowd clamoring to get into B. Altman's main store
in Manhattan was so heavy that shoppers were admitted in shifts. By
mid-afternoon police surrounding the exterior of the enormous store
were turning people away, saying the building was dangerously
overcrowded.
   Special prices and services for shoppers who showed up early
boosted traffic at many places.
   The Wal-Mart discount store in Terre Haute, Ind., offered extra
low prices on selected items from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m., Assistant
Manager Kris Gates said. During a 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. sale at Fred
Meyer's, a discount store about 20 miles south of downtown Seattle,
shoppers drank free coffee, sipped apple cider and munched on
doughnuts.
   Shoppers at Grossmont Center outside San Diego could leave their
youngsters at a free child care center and take beepers in case of
an emergency. Emporium-Capwell's outside Oakland lured Bay Area
buyers with free valet parking for three hours.
   The early starting times weren't a resounding success
everywhere. In West Virginia, only a few shoppers had turned up
when Charleston Town Center's anchor stores opened at 8 a.m., two
hours earlier than usual.
   ``It hasn't exactly been a door-busting event,'' said Bonnie
Godfrey, senior merchandising manager for the J.C. Penney Co. Inc.
store there.
   The wintry weather that blasted the Northeast may have been a
blessing for retailers that had been having poor sales of
cold-weather goods.
   New York's first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years, combined
with freezing temperatures, apparently put people in the mood to
buy warm clothing, said Ann Stock, spokeswoman at the
Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.
   Almost half of retailers' annual business is done in the weeks
between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Most retailers and industry analysts are expecting cautious
spending this year on expensive, long-lasting goods, such as home
appliances. Overall retail sales are predicted to rise only 5.5
percent over last year, compared with 1988's surprisingly strong 9
percent gain.
   Typically there is a crush of shopping done in the days
immediately after Thanksgiving and then a long lull until the
final, frantic days just before Christmas.
   For the most part, shoppers seemed happy to jostle their way
through the crowds if it meant finding good deals.
   Shopping at an Atlanta mall, Mattie Wyatt said she didn't mind
looking for presents amid the post-Thanksgiving throng. ``It's
convenient, there's enough parking, and there are sales,'' Mrs.
Wyatt said. ``What could be better?''
   But there were indications shoppers would be choosy this year.
``I'll probably wait until after Christmas to see if I can get
anything cheaper,'' said Alice Guerra, in Austin, Texas.

<TEXT>
   Parliament Friday chose lawmaker Elias
Hrawi as Lebanon's 10th president and he pledged to carry on the
national unity programs of his predecessor, Rene Mouawad, who was
assassinated after 17 days in office.
   Eight hours later, Hrawi early Saturday dismissed the military
interim Cabinet of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun and formed a 14-man
government under Moslem Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
   Hrawi, a wealthy Maronite Catholic agricultural engineer,
promised Friday to abide by the peace plan worked out by Lebanese
legislators last month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, aimed at ending the
14-year-old civil war. The Arab League-brokered plan shifts
political power to the Moslem majority.
   ``The peace march has started and it will not stumble,'' said
the new 62-year-old president. ``We shall not allow anyone to stand
in the way.''
   Aoun, named head of an interim Cabinet in September last year by
outgoing President Amin Gemayel, opposes the Taif plan because it
fails to say when Syria's 40,000 troops will be withdrawn from
Lebanon.
   There was no immediate comment from the general early Saturday
on Hrawi's order to dissolve his interim Cabinet.
   Hoss' government included George Saadeh, a Maronite who heads
the right-wing Phalange Party, as minister of post and
telecommunications. Shiite Moslem Militia chieftain Nabih Berri was
named minister of electrical and hydrolic resources as well as
minister of housing and cooperatives. Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt
was given the public works portfolio.
   Hrawi was elected by lawmakers who were guarded by hundreds of
Syrian troops, and he was sworn in by Speaker Hussein Husseini.
   In Hrawi's hometown of Zahleh, people danced in the streets,
fired into the air and drank arak, the national drink, in
celebration.
   In his acceptance speech, Hrawi pledged to ``adhere to the Taif
accord and work for peace'' in Lebanon.
   ``I promise the nation to follow the same path that martyred
President Mouawad had planned for national unity,'' said Hrawi, who
has been in Parliament since 1972 and maintains good contacts with
Lebanon's Moslems as well as neighboring Syria.
   The vote came on the eve of Mouawad's burial in his northern
Lebanese hometown of Zgorta. Thousands of mourners met the 300-car
funeral procession and women kissed his casket.
   Mouawad, 64, was assassinated by a remote-controlled bomb
Wednesday that exploded amid his motorcade in Moslem west Beirut.
The blast killed 23 others.
   State-run Channel 7 interrupted its programs to announce Hwari's
selection. ``The nation is determined to survive in defiance of
President Mouawad's assassins,'' the announcer said.
   Reacting to Hrawi's election, Aoun said Friday: ``May he live
long. I ask God to shield him against his protectors,'' an apparent
reference to Syria.
   He also announced a nationwide day of mourning for Mouawad on
Saturday. The general, however, has denounced the Taif accord and
the earlier election of Mouawad as unconstitutional.
   Syria and its leftist Moslem and Christian allies have blamed
Mouwad's assassination on Aoun, but the general has denied
involvement.
   Syrian President Hafez Assad sent a telegram to Hrawi saying,
``I see in your election an honor to the soul of the late President
Mouawad, who was determined to end Lebanon's torment.''
   The White House said President Bush ``commends the Lebanese
Parliament for its swift decision'' and called for all Lebanese
``to stand with President Hrawi in his efforts to work for unity
and peace.''
   ``Those who do not will only isolate themselves further from
Lebanon's people and the international community,'' the statement
said.
   The Arab League envoy to the United Nations, Clovis Maksoud,
said the election ``is a tribute to the courage of the members of
Parliament. And the new president deserves all the support that the
international community can provide.''
   Husseini said Hrawi was elected by 47 votes in the second round
of balloting. Five blank ballots were found and one deputy
abstained. In the first round, Hrawi got 46 votes, two less than
the two-thirds' majority of 48 votes required by the Constitution.
Only a majority was needed on the second ballot.
   His election was announced 20 minutes after the parliamentary
session started at the Park Hotel in Chtoura, 25 miles east of
Beirut.
   Shortly after Hrawi was sworn in, Husseini convened another
10-minute session of the house which unanimously voted to extend
its mandate for another four-year term ending in December 1994.
Parliament's current mandate expires Dec. 31, 1990.
   Voice of the Nation, a Moslem radio station, also said the new
president would appoint a new army commander. The report could not
be officially confirmed.
   Mouawad's election Nov. 5 had ended 14 months of political
vacuum after Gemayel's term expired with Parliment unable to gather
the necessary quorum for an election session.
   The political turmoil triggered one of the country's bloodiest
rounds of violence, pitting Aoun's troops against Syrian and
Lebanese Moslem forces. Arab League intervention halted the
fighting Sept. 22.
   With 53 legislators, the Parliament had achieved its needed
quorum to convene.
   The 99-seat Parliament was elected in 1972 for a four-year term.
The civil war, which broke out in 1975, has prevented elections.
Twenty-six deputies have died and Gemayel lost his seat when
elected head of state.
   In line with an unwritten national covenant dating to
independence from France in 1943, Lebanon's president is a Maronite
Catholic, its premier a Sunni Moslem and the Parliament speaker a
Shiite Moslem.

   Anchorman Dan Rather flies to Prague on Saturday
to help report on events there for CBS' Sunday newscast and
Monday's ``CBS Evening News,'' a spokeswoman said Friday.
   It will be Rather's second trip there since Nov. 13. There was
no word from NBC and ABC on whether their anchors, Tom Brokaw and
Peter Jennings, respectively, also would go to Czechoslovakia to
help cover developments occurring in the wake of massive
pro-democracy demonstrations there. Cable News Network isn't
dispatching an anchor, a spokeswoman said.
   All four networks have correspondents at the scene.
   CNN anchor Bernard Shaw, and Jennings, Rather and Brokaw all are
scheduled to anchor or co-anchor newscasts from Malta during the
upcoming Soviet-American summit conference.

   A 9-year-old boy hunting with his grandfather
in Ocala National Forest was killed Friday when he was shot by
another hunter who mistook him for a deer, authorities said.
   Benjamin Murray of Fort McCoy was squirrel hunting with his
grandfather, Terry Heily, when he was shot in the back of the head
while sitting in his grandfather's lap, said Marion County
sheriff's Lt. Fred LaTorre.
   Ronald Edge was charged with manslaughter in the boy's death,
LaTorre said.
   Edge, 44, told investigators that he saw movement and what he
thought was a deer before firing a rifle near the Ocklawaha River,
LaTorre said.
   Edge told deputies he checked his gunsight several times before
firing.

<TEXT>
   Several hundred stone-throwing Vietnamese
refugees fought a pitched battle inside a detention center Saturday
and police fired more than 20 rounds of tear gas grenades to regain
control, officials reported.
   Police said the fighting at the Shek Kong center involved rival
groups from different provinces in Vietnam and began after one man
was attacked.
   They reported three Vietnamese were hospitalized for injuries
and one police officer was wounded slightly.
   There have been frequent fights in recent months among
Vietnamese boat people held in detention camps in this small
British colony.
   More than 55,000 Vietnamese refugees are languishing in the Hong
Kong camps, hoping for resettlement and fearing repatriation to
their communist-ruled homeland.
   It is expected that tens of thousands of boat people will be
denied refugee status by Hong Kong, and tension has increased in
the camps with the possibility that they will be sent back to
Vietnam.
   The United Nations Refugee Agency asked the Hong Kong government
Friday to investigate allegations that undue force was used when
moving Vietnamese refugees from one camp to another.
   The Hong Kong office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
had earlier protested the circumstances of an early morning
transfer on Oct. 31 of 48 Vietnamese.
   Some of the Vietnamese told the U.N. agency that security forces
used martial-arts tactics to immobilize them during the move from a
detention center to a holding center for refugees who may be
forcibly sent back to Vietnam.
   The government denied earlier this week that unreasonable force
was used during the transfer.

   East German officials Friday displayed what
they said was a sophisticated U.S. military spying device they
found and dismantled this fall.
   It registered vehicle movements at an army installation near
Frankfurt an der Oder, East Germany, military intelligence
officials told a news conference.
   They said the bug also could have been used for electronic
guidance of a Western missile attack.
   The officials said the device was disguised as an outdoor
electrical control box, that it transmitted data to a U.S. military
spy satellite and is believed to have been operated by U.S. army
intelligence.
   A U.S. Mission spokesman in West Berlin, Anthony Sariti,
referred a query on the allegations to the U.S. Embassy in Bonn. A
spokesman there, Cornelius Walsh, told The Associated Press he
could not confirm or deny the accusations.
   The official news agency ADN said the damage to East German
military secrets could not yet be calculated.
   A Defense Ministry official at the news conference, Maj.
Karl-Heinz Krawczyk, said Western spy agencies were ``sowing
mistrust'' that threatens the success of East-West disarmament
negotiations.

<HEAD>Krenz Says Dismantling of Berlin Wall Depends on West Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz, in
an interview published Saturday, declared his country's allegiance
to socialism and said dismantling of more of the Berlin Wall
depends on West Germany.
   Krenz told London's Financial Times that a decision whether to
open the Brandenburg Gate will be based on cooperation from West
Germany and West Berlin.
   The newspaper quoted Krenz as saying, ``At the moment, we are
not planning to open it (the Brandenburg Gate). Whether we open it,
and when we open it, depends not on us but on the other side.''
There have been rumors that the crossing at the gate would soon be
open.
   The Financial Times reported Krenz said that although East
Germany opened its western border to virtually unrestricted travel
two weeks ago, the main Berlin Wall will remain in place to prevent
unification of East and West Germany.
   ``The falling away of the border would have significant
consequences for carrying out certain plans for reunification,''
Krenz said, and at the present ``the existence of two German states
is a question of stability and peace in Europe.''
   He also was quoted as saying it was unlikely that planned free
elections in East Germany could be held befsdore the end of 1990.
   Krenz became party chief Oct. 18 when hard-line leader Erich
Honecker was forced to resign.
   The Financial Times said the interview was conducted Friday in
Krenz's office at his party headquarters in East Berlin.
   It reported he criticized what he called West German efforts to
force East Germany into market-oriented reform in exchange for aid
and said, ``I cannot imagine East Germany as a capitalist country.''
   The newspaper said Krenz had these replies to questions on other
issues:
   East Germany's interest in joining the European Economic
Community is ``a difficult question to judge today.'' It is ``a
question ... to do with the common European house which we all want
to build.''
   East and West Germany could move toward a form of confederation
if the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Warsaw Pact alliance
dissolve.
   ``The question of reunification at the moment is not on the
agenda because it would totally change the power relationships in
Europe.''
   One reason for East Germany's economic difficulties is adherence
to an administrative system inherited from the Stalinist past.
   ``We are ready to take advice about making our state more
effective and attractive. But we are not ready to be dictated to
with conditions from any other country _ especially the Federal
Republic (West Germany).''

   A television set started a fire that swept
through a row house early Friday, killing two children, their aunt
and grandmother, fire officials said.
   Three other siblings and the mother of the five children also
were injured in the blaze, including one child hospitalized in
critical condition, officials said.
   Sheila Travers said she was with her five children in a back
bedroom when the fire started.
   ``The smoke was so thick it pushed us back and trapped us all.
We couldn't get out,'' she said.
   Travers' 10-year-old daughter, Angela, 11-year-old son
Christopher, and their aunt, Michelle Travers, 27, died in the
blaze, fire Capt. Pat Flynn said. Dorothy Travers, 56, the
children's grandmother, died later of smoke inhalation and burns,
Flynn said. She had invited the family to spend Thanksgiving night
at her home, he said.
   Teresa Travers, 13, was in critical condition at St. Agnes
Hospital, and her 9-year-old sister, April Travers, was in stable
condition.
   Sheila Travers and her 7-year-old son, James Lee, were treated
for injuries but not hospitalized.
   The fire apparently was ignited by a malfunctioning television
set in a second-floor bedroom, Flynn said.
   Gladys John, a neighbor, said she and others tried to rescue
some of the children from a second-floor bedroom.
   ``Everybody got around, telling them to throw the children, but
the children wouldn't let go, they wanted to stay with the
mother,'' she said.

   Four people died when their twin-engine
plane crashed near the Arlington Municipal Airport after they made
a Thanksgiving Day visit to a hospital, police said Friday.
   The wreckage of the Beechcraft was spotted in a field near the
end of the runway Friday morning. Arlington police spokesman Dee
Anderson said the plane apparently crashed shortly after take-off
Thursday night.
   There was no fire and the plane's emergency locator device did
not operate, authorities said. The plane had been bound for
Midland, they said.
   Investigator Rodney Crow with the Tarrant County Medical
Examiner's office identified the victims Friday night as Dennis
Hughes, 49; his wife, Brenda Hughes, 39; Jean Insley, 48; and
Michael Insley, 44. Authorities did not say who they had visited at
the Arlington hospital.
   Their deaths raised the number killed in aircraft accidents
since the holiday weekend began to nine, officials in Texas said.
   Myron Anderson, 42, and his co-pilot, Vernon Charles Rawls, 55,
died Thursday when their stunt plane stalled in a dive and crashed
in the Fort Worth suburb of Azle.
   Also Thursday, the Coast Guard called off a search for three
people missing since their plane ditched in the Gulf of Mexico
Wednesday night.
   Sophia Mifsud, 26, her 3-year-old daughter, Ariel, and
2-month-old son, Martin, were presumed drowned. Thomas Mifsud, 32,
who piloted the plane, swam to an unmanned oil rig. He was treated
for shock, hypothermia and minor cuts at a Corpus Christi hospital
and released.
   In Tyler, meanwhile, two servicemen were in stable condition
Friday, one day after their Army helicopter crashed near Crockett.
Pilot Tim Stachewich and Brian Mahoney were returning to Fort Polk,
La., from a training mission in California, a statement from the
base said.

   Mothers who take multiple vitamins containing
folic acid early in pregnancy are significantly less likely to bear
babies with spina bifida and other spinal column defects, a new
study concludes.
   The birth defects were about one-fourth as common among babies
whose mothers took the over-the-counter vitamins than among babies
whose mothers didn't take vitamins, according to a report in
today's Journal of the American Medical Association.
   The apparent beneficial effect was limited to women who took the
vitamins in the first six weeks of pregnancy, leading the
researchers to suggest women begin taking vitamins with folic acid
when they first start trying to conceive.
   The defects include spina bifida, in which incomplete closing of
the bony casing around the spinal cord typically results in mild or
severe paralysis. Another spinal column defect is anencephaly, in
which major parts of the brain are lacking and death usually occurs
within hours.

   Those dreaming of a white Thanksgiving got their wish in the
East and South, while the needy were remembered in shelters and
soup kitchens as Americans paused to ponder their blessings.
   Giving thanks was on the minds of thousands of victims of
Hurricane Hugo, northern California's earthquake and other natural
disasters that jolted the nation this year.
   ``We are alive. We have more reasons to give thanks than we do
to be sorry,'' said Mabel Martin, owner of a trailer park in
Alorton in southern Illinois that was devastated by a Nov. 15 storm
that caused an estimated $5.3 million in damage.
   The snow that fell from Virginia to New England canceled high
school football games in the Northeast, but neither a wascally
wabbit who wouldn't waft nor a fallen Humpty Dumpty dampened the
spirits of millions of parade watchers.

   President Alfredo Cristiani
said the assault by leftist rebels was a failure and he rejected
their conditions for peace. His comments were punctuated by rebel
bombs that exploded near his news conference.
   The series of bombs exploded about five blocks from where
Cristiani was speaking to reporters Thursday evening. Cristiani
jumped, but kept talking, telling everyone ``not to worry.'' No
injuries were reported.
   Cristiani termed ``nonsense'' the guerrillas' call for political
negotiations leading to a cease-fire. The rightist government is
demanding a truce first, then talks.
   ``Without a cease-fire the guerrillas will use the peace process
for propaganda,'' said Cristiani.

   The U.S. Supreme Court could still make
significant changes in abortion law, despite the out-of-court
settlement of one of three key abortion-rights cases on its docket
this session.
   The high court is scheduled to hear arguments Wednesday in cases
from Ohio and Minnesota, both of which focus on state laws
requiring that one or both parents be notified before a minor gets
an abortion.
   Those cases _ and an Illinois dispute settled out of court
earlier this week _ were seen by those on both sides of the issue
as likely vehicles for the Supreme Court to expand or modify its
July ruling allowing states greater leeway to restrict abortion.
   The Illinois case, over state regulation of abortion clinics,
was the most likely of the three to result in changes to the
court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, said Jack Tunheim, chief deputy
attorney general for Minnesota. The Illinois case affected all
women, rather than just minors.
   ``I don't think the Illinois settlement will have any impact on
our case,'' Tunheim said Thursday. ``The Minnesota case and the
Ohio case both involve what we view as a very, very different
proposition _ the issue of minors' abortions.''

   Discovery's astronauts set their
sights on a Sunday landing for a secret military space shuttle
mission that sources said included deployment of a spy satellite.
   Silence has surrounded most of the classified flight, but NASA
did interrupt the quiet briefly on Thanksgiving Day to announce
that the shuttle was scheduled to land at 7:02 p.m. PST Sunday at
Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``The crew is doing well and the orbiter continues to perform
satisfactorily,'' Mission Control commentator Billie Deason said in
the brief status report Thursday evening.
   According to sources close to the project, a 2{-ton, $300
million payload was released from the shuttle's cargo bay early
Thursday morning about 10 hours into the flight.

<HEAD>Network Anchors Go Down To The Sea For Summit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This weekend, network anchors and correspondents
will go down to the sea in ships _ Soviet and American guided
missile cruisers _ for the summit meeting of President Bush and
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The warship setting in Malta may be reminiscent of August 1941,
when President Franklin Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston
Churchill met aboard warships in Newfoundland for a meeting that
produced the Atlantic Charter.
   But now, as then, the Fourth Estate won't need sea legs. As in
1941, the ships involved in a historic meeting aren't far from
land, this time about 1,000 yards offshore in the harbor at
Marsaxloc, on the south coast of Malta.
   This being the age of TV and satellites, those covering and
participating in the shipboard summits on Saturday and Sunday may
be able to see themselves on TV on the ships, the USS Belknap and
the Soviet navy's Slava.
   CNN, whose Washington-based anchor, Bernard Shaw, is among 60
Cable News Network staffers heading to Malta, is hoping to install
on each ship portable facilities to receive CNN's worldwide
newscasts, a spokesman here says.
   ``They're trying hard to set it up,'' he says. ``Obviously that
takes a little more effort, but that's what they're trying to do.''
   Peter Jennings, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw, the anchors of ABC,
CBS and NBC, respectively, also are making the voyage to Malta, the
point men of a three-network army totalling nearly 200 staffers
from Europe and the United States.
   Each anchor first will report from Rome on the meeting Friday
between Gorbachev and Pope John Paul II before moving on to Malta
and coverage of a summit in which the upheaval in Eastern Europe
may produce major news.
   The White House press center, the networks' command stations and
portable satellite transmission centers on Malta will be in its
capital city, Valletta, a few miles from the harbor in which the
shipboard meetings will occur.
   But Jeff Gralnick, Lane Venardos and Joe Angotti, the executives
in charge of the ABC, CBS and NBC expeditions, respectively, say
they don't expect any problems with getting live video signals from
the ships.
   Although anchoring newscasts from the ships is an unlikely
possibility, they say, they anticipate being able to send live
reports from the ships on their own, separate circuits via
microwave.
   Those transmissions and those of CNN then would be relayed to
Valletta _ where the network evening newscasts will be anchored _
for satellite feeds to the United States.
   ``I don't anticipate any difficulties,'' says Angotti. ``They
are making available to us pretty complete access to getting
pictures microwaved off of each of the ships.
   ``I expect that we'll have as much coverage of this summit as we
would on a land-based summit.''
   Saturday's opening day of talks is to be held aboard the Slava,
with Sunday's session aboard the Belknap. Developments from each
are to be reported live and on videotape as warranted.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to close their summit with a
joint statement, and then hold separate news conferences. The
networks expect to air all three events live, starting at 8 a.m.
EST on Sunday.
   The only big problem that CBS' Venardos says he worries about is
trying to get information when Bush, Gorbachev and their spokesmen
``are isolated on these ships.''
   At such times, he says, ``there's no way to pick up the phone''
and ask for the spokesmen. ``We have to wait until they come off
the ships to find out what happened. And so, the clamor for
information is going to be pretty loud down there, I think.''
   But each side seems eager to have this one of the most
accessible-to-television summits in recent history, he says.
   The networks' shipboard microwave transmission links can be shut
down at any time, Venardos says, but ``both sides have been
extraordinarily interested in having live television available on
this event ... the Russians no less than the Americans.''

   Margaret O'Brien thought it was just part of
everyday life to make movies, work with major stars, meet the
British prime minister and sit in Parliament.
   ``These people were a part of my life when I was a child,'' she
recalled. ``They all seemed like part of the family.''
   O'Brien, who made her film debut in 1942 in ``Journey For
Margaret,'' is featured with many other child stars in ``When We
Were Young ... Growing Up On the Silver Screen.'' The 90-minute
special from WTTW in Chicago will be telecast on PBS on Monday,
Dec. 4.
   The show has scenes from many old movies and interviews with
such child stars as O'Brien, Jackie Cooper, Mickey Rooney, Spanky
McFarland, Jane Withers, Dick Moore, Roddy McDowall, Dean
Stockwell, Darryl Hickman, Tommy Rettig, Angela Cartwright, Hayley
Mills and Diana Serra Carey, who was Baby Peggy.
   Former bit player Darryl Hickman became a star at the age of 8
when he did ``The Star Maker'' in 1939 with Bing Crosby. Crosby
played a vaudeville impresario who worked with children.
   ``Bing took me under his wing and got his brother, Everett, who
was one of the big Hollywood agents, to become my agent,'' Hickman
said in an interview. ``I went right into more movies and kept
working most of my childhood. I got a lot of feedback from
moviegoers who grew up with me, identified with me and, I think,
envied me because I was in pictures.''
   ``When We Were Young'' shows how the movies and child stars of
the 1930s and 1940s reflected the social conditions of the times.
Shirley Temple became such a national booster during the Depression
that President Franklin D. Roosevelt commented that an American
could pay 15 cents ``to go to a movie, look at the smiling face of
a baby and forget his troubles.''
   The children expressed optimism and a hope for the future, as
well as serving as alter egos for young moviegoers.
   Jackie Coogan became the first child star when he played
opposite Charlie Chaplin in ``The Kid'' in 1920. He became better
known later as Uncle Fester on ``The Addams Family.'' Diana Serra
was Baby Peggy in shorts during the silent film era. Spanky
McFarland, Alfalfa, Stymie, Buckwheat, Darla and dozens of other
characters made up the ``Our Gang'' shorts.
   The last child star developed under the old studio system was
Hayley Mills. She was in ``The Parent Trap'' in 1961. Later, as an
adult, she starred in a sequel for Disney.
   ``I was one who really liked making movies,'' O'Brien said. ``I
had a normal life outside of the studio, although I took it very
seriously as a job. I wanted to do my best.''
   Jane Withers became a star when the studio needed a brat to star
opposite Shirley Temple in ``Bright Eyes'' in 1934.
   ``I was the meanest, creepiest kid you ever saw,'' said Withers.
``You wanted to choke her. I was 5 at the time and went on to do
another hundred pictures. They were mostly B films. The biggest
movie I was ever in was `Giant.'''
   Withers is probably best known to later generations as Josephine
the Plumber, who appeared for 17 years in commercials for Comet
cleanser. Withers has an enormous collection of movie memorabilia
that she hopes to put into a museum.
   O'Brien continues to act occasionally, although she devotes most
of her time now to promoting a new Margaret O'Brien Doll and to
lecturing.
   Hickman, whose brother Dwayne starred in ``The Many Loves of
Dobie Gillis,'' now earns his living as an acting teacher. His last
film was ``Sharky's Machine'' in 1981.
   Many former child stars are still working in films. Elizabeth
Taylor, Mickey Rooney, Roddy McDowall and Hayley Mills are still
acting. Jackie Cooper works mostly as a director now. Dean
Stockwell stars in the NBC series ``Quantum Leap'' and was
nominated for an Oscar for ``Married To the Mob.''

<HEAD>Michigan State Wrapped up in Packaging Problems</HEAD>

   Good things used to come in small
packages. Now they come in a box inside a box, packed in foam and
wrapped in plastic.
   All that packaging has some consumers fuming about hard-to-open
containers and environmentalists warning that landfills are nearly
full.
   Harold Hughes says the packaging industry is getting a bad rap.
   Hughes, director of the School of Packaging at Michigan State
University, sings the praises of modern synthetic packagings for
their efficiency at protecting and helping promote the products
they wrap.
   But even Hughes finds some packaging frustrating.
   ``I bought a spark plug the other day and I was convinced I
would break the thing before I got that plastic open. I couldn't
cut it, I couldn't do anything to it. I was ready to take it down
and table saw it. It happens,'' he said.
   Michigan State, which annually graduates two-thirds of the
world's packaging students, is regarded as a leader in the $70
billion packaging field because of its research into packaging
technology.
   The packaging business mainly was a plain brown-wrapper business
when the Michigan State school was started in 1952 at the urging of
industry groups wanting improved wooden shipping crates.
   The school opened with five students and a half-time instructor
holding class in an old log cabin on campus.
   Now the school, one of a handful of comprehensive packaging
programs in the United States, has 600 students, 27 full-time
professors and 30 part-time graduate assistants who can use
sophisticated equipment to wrap items in plastic or smash
student-made cardboard boxes to test their strength.
   Packaging majors study a mix of math, chemistry, physics,
accounting, communications and business courses, as well as
packaging courses. Few come to Michigan State planning to major in
packaging, Hughes said. Most transfer into the school from
engineering or other majors.
   Packaging school research is aimed at easing consumer
frustration and landfill concerns, Hughes said. Recently, the
school attacked a classic consumer packaging complaint: childproof
medicine containers.
   Many elderly people find the containers too hard to open, so the
school joined with the Geriatric Research Center at Western
Michigan University to design alternatives. The project was funded
by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   Students submitted a dozen designs, including some likely to be
adopted by industry, Hughes said.
   ``What they found was that a 74-year-old has basically the same
hand strength as a 4-year-old. Something that kept a 4-year-old out
also kept a 74-year-old out,'' he said.
   The favored designs substituted intelligence for strength. One
uses a key or coin to unlock the cap. Another suggestion was to
print the instructions on the container in contrasting colors,
rather than hard-to-read white-on-white lettering.
   A bigger headache is what to do with used packaging.
   An estimated 30 percent to 35 percent of the 12 million tons of
solid waste annually generated in Michigan is packaging, said Fred
Clinton, chief of the resource recovery section of the state
Department of Natural Resources.
   ``The packaging does what it is supposed to do, protect the
product for a specified period of time. The industry is doing a
great job of designing packages to do that, but at the same time,
they are moving toward a less recyclable package,'' he said.
   For example, plastic bottles sometimes are made of several
layers of different materials, making them difficult to recycle, he
said.
   Research by the packaging school might help ease some of the
environmental problems.
   Associate Professor Sue Selke showed that high density
polyethylene from recycled milk jugs is very similar to virgin
plastic, helping erase the stigma that recycled material is
inferior to new.
   Her finding confirmed what environmentalists had been saying but
lacked any proof to support.
   Selke also mixed wood fibers with plastic to create a composite
material strong enough to be used as synthetic lumber for such
things as pallets and packing crates. The material potentially
could expand the market for recycled plastic and encourage more
recycling.
   ``What we need is an entrepreneur to take our idea and start
working on it. We don't have that capability,'' she said.

<HEAD>Ramses Colossus: Another King Retouched?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With LaserPhoto ^By MIMI MANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAIRO, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans marveled at the towering statue of
Ramses II in an exhibit of artifacts from the mighty pharaoh's
reign, but now it appears the colossus is a retouched image of
someone else.
   New research indicates the statue was of a lesser-known pharaoh
who ruled 600 years before Ramses the Great was born. Experts say
it became Ramses because he had his artisans retouch the face and
inscribe his name.
   They also say the ancients would have been worshipping both
god-kings when they made offerings to the 24-foot statue of red
granite, which weighs 47 tons.
   No one doubted the statue was of Ramses when, in 1987, it was
pulled from its grave of mud and weeds in Memphis, the ancient
Egyptian capital.
   So positive were promoters that it was given a royal sendoff
from the Mediterranean port of Alexandria. A band played the
national anthem and boat sirens blared a 20-minute farewell salute.
   With American help, the statue was restored at Memphis State
University in Tennessee. Then it joined other Ramses artifacts
already being exhibited to complete a hugely successful nationwide
tour of U.S. museums.
   First at Memphis, then in Denver, Boston, Charlotte, N.C., and
Dallas, the colossus stole the show.
   But it isn't Ramses, says art historian Hourig Sourouzian, who
has spent years studying Ramses statues.
   ``It's Sesostris I,'' she said. ``Ramses touched it up, made it
more his style and put his name on it.
   ``Of course, when Ramses did this, the statue became Ramses. No
problem. But when the ancients were giving gifts to the colossus,
they were remembering not only Ramses, but Sesostris.''
   Sesostris I also was called ``the Great'' and died in 1926 B.C.
He was a pharaoh of the Middle Kingdom, while Ramses was of the New
Kingdom, ruling for 67 years in the 13th century B.C.
   Ms. Sourouzian said a major problem in identifying large
Egyptian statues is that ``Ramses had so many of them, and his name
was so famous, that any oversized statue naturally was assumed to
have been his.''
   Nevertheless, she said, ``something disturbed me even then''
when she first saw the colossus in the mud of Egypt.
   ``The next time I saw it was on exhibit'' in Memphis, Tenn., she
said. ``It was beautifully restored, beautifully lighted, but when
I took a deep look, I said, `It's not Ramses.'''
   Rita Freed, who led the restoration team for the Institute of
Egyptian Art and Archaeology at Memphis State, said she first heard
of the Sourouzian research a year ago.
   ``It's excellent. I think she's right,'' Ms. Freed said by
telephone from the Boston Museum, where she now works.
   ``I didn't think anything about it until we brought the statue
to Tennessee,'' she said. ``Once we had it standing, I said, `Gee,
that looks Middle Kingdom,' but I must emphasize it's Ramses. His
name is on it and we've done a wonderful job of saving a
magnificent statue.''
   It is no secret that Ramses had a fondness for gigantic statues
of himself. He erected them throughout Egypt.
   Some depict him standing, some sitting. The largest, estimated
to have stood 57 feet and weighed 1,000 tons, lies headless in his
ruined mortuary temple, the Ramesseum.
   Perhaps the most famous are the four seated statues at Abu
Simbel, southern Egypt.
   Ms. Sourouzian said she discovered Ramses the Great borrowed
colossal statues in his customary grand style. She reported finding
nine Sesostris I retreads.
   Both pharaohs had connections with Memphis, now Mit Rahina
village, 17 miles south of Cairo. Memphis contained several
colossi, including one of Ramses now in Cairo's Ramses Square.
   Another of him remains at Mit Rahina, on display where it fell.
A twin of the colossus that toured America, also a made-over
Sesostris, is in pieces at the Mit Rahina outdoor museum, Ms.
Sourouzian said.
   Discovering what is or is not the Ramses look hasn't been easy
for the Armenian-born scholar, who is a doctoral candidate at the
Sorbonne in Paris and co-author of the official catalogue of
Cairo's Egyptian Museum.
   Relics of Ramses and his family are everywhere in Egypt. He had
at least three queens and scores of lesser wives and is said to
have fathered 167 children.
   About 300 statues of Ramses have survived, and Ms. Sourouzian
has used her artist's eye to examine them: clothing, expression,
muscles, size of the legs, items in each hand, the crown.
   Statues of Sesostris' era had one look, those of Ramses' another.
   ``In earlier times, statues showed fierceness because the
pharaohs were trying to show they could smite their enemies,'' Ms.
Sourouzian said. ``Ramses, who truly was great, could have
portrayed himself on statues this way, but he preferred a faint
smile, a gentleness.
   ``A Ramses statue has a sweet expression. He has massive legs
and wears a longer kilt. He has a triangular or round face with
almost almond-shaped eyes, looking down. He wears a uraeus on his
crown,'' an ornamental cobra favored by New Kingdom pharaohs.
   The nine colossi that Ramses recycled are backed by stone slabs
and have straight mouths, rectangular faces, thick cheeks and eyes
staring straight ahead. The kilts are short.
   Despite Ms. Sourouzian's research, the identity of the colossus
scheduled to arrive home from America on Dec. 6 is not in question,
said Egyptian antiquities official Zahi Hawass.
   ``When the statue is perched on its waiting pedestal in ancient
Memphis, the name we'll put under it is Ramses II,'' he said.

   Kieko Hara has attended a ``cram school'' for
months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams. She's
5, and her parents hope Kieko will make it into a top-ranked
private elementary school.
   She attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten
and on weekends.
   Some days, Kieko makes rice balls or crafts, or is drilled in
the Japanese alphabet. Once a week, she takes a practice test like
those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they
accept.
   ``We wish she didn't have to go to cram school, but if she gets
into a good private ... system now, then she'll be able to enter
the school's junior high automatically,'' said Yuko, her mother.
   Japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the
high scores of students on achievement tests, but as public schools
have become more equal, parents have sought an edge elsewhere.
   Children are being sent at ever-younger ages to cram schools,
called jukus, or are going to private rather than public schools in
hopes of gaining ground in the merciless college-entrance
competition.
   The Education Ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior
high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons, in
effect creating an entire second school system. It is a booming
business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen, or $7 billion,
a year.
   Some Japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in
education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the
public school system. Others feel public schools have concentrated
on educating the mass of students, neglecting the bright and
creative.
   Getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering
amount of money, as well as work.
   Kieko's parents pay about 65,000 yen ($460) a month for her juku
classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten. Some
classmates began attending a juku at age 3, to prepare for the
kindergarten entrance exam, and now have daily cram sessions before
kindergarten and again in the afternoon.
   Such devotion to schooling has a long history in Japan and some
other Asian nations, but the intense competition is largely a
postwar development that grew with economic prosperity.
   Japan spends less on public education than the United States,
both in total amount and percentage of gross national product.
   In the last fiscal year, the government allocated 16 trillion
yen ($112 billion) to public education, compared with $353 billion
this year in the United States.
   An Education Minstry study in 1987 said 4.2 percent of Japan's
GNP went to public education, compared with 4.8 percent in the
United States, 4.4 percent in Britain and 4.2 percent in West
Germany.
   Spending on education in the United States varies greatly by
school district and region, but Japan has followed a policy of
equal distribution of resources. It also does not ``track''
students, separating them according to ability.
   In the United States, the federal government provides about 6
percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school.
Japan's central government pays 43 percent, much of it in subsidies
to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20
percent, according to government figures.
   The Education Ministry approves textbooks and curricula, so all
students study essentially the same material at the same time.
   In high school, Japanese students cram for college entrance
exams that determine not only what schools they will attend, but
their chances for a good job afterward.
   Companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only
the top universities.
   College entrance exams have become more difficult as competition
has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the
public school curriculum, according to Education Ministry studies.
   With craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten, ``by
junior high school many students feel their life has already been
ordained,'' said Naomi Kikuchi, who has two children in school.
   In the past, a leading public high school was considered the
best preparation for college entrance. That changed as the high
schools became more equal.
   Many parents and students now see jukus, with their
single-minded emphasis on preparing for exams, as more helpful than
public schools in gaining admission to good universities.
   About 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they
disapproved of jukus, but most said they enrolled their children as
``a necessary evil.''
   Other families try to get their children into top private
kindergartens or elementary schools, especially those of respected
private universities that automatically admit graduates of their
own lower schools.
   The first year of Aoyama University's kindergarten, one of the
most sought-after schools, costs about 1.4 million yen ($9,500),
more than the 980,000-yen ($6,800) for the first year of university.
   A survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses
account for 13.4 percent of after-tax earnings for an average
Japanese family in a metropolitan area.
   That did not include salary forgone by the ``kyoiku mama,''
mothers who devote themselves to their children's education until
the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before
entrance exams.
   ``For people without money and mothers who have to work, it's
hard to get children into a good school,'' Mrs. Kikuchi said.

<HEAD>Who Was the Man Who Spoke Russian and Sold the Gun?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer=
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A man who spoke Russian entered a
store in the bazaar, opened a black briefcase and produced an
automatic weapon.
   After several minutes of negotiation, the shopkeeper paid him
200,000 afghanis, or $500, for the gun. When a reporter approached
him in the street seconds later and addressed him in English, the
man got into a green jeep without license plates and drove away.
   Who was this man?
   Merchants said he and dozens like him identify themselves as
Soviet soldiers. Since the Soviet withdrawal was completed Feb. 15,
they say, those ``soldiers'' have sold them at least 20 automatic
weapons.
   Where the men are stationed, or what they are doing here, the
shopkeepers can only guess.
   Diplomats from countries with close ties to the Soviet Union say
the only Red Army soldier in Afghanistan is the embassy military
attache. They say all the others left in February.
   The Afghan government's position on the issue has not been
clear. On Oct. 14, the official news agency Bakhtar reported the
presence of Soviet military advisers in Kabul.
   It added that they ``only handle deliveries of arms and provide
information on the specifications of arms and ammunition to the
Afghan side, and do not take part in military operations at all.''
   A day later, government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said the
Bakhtar report was ``an error,'' that there were no Soviet soldiers
in Afghanistan.
   Another government official quoted an Afghan military officer as
saying Soviet soldiers operated a missile base on the outskirts of
Kabul. He said the Soviets were unwilling to train Afghan soldiers
to use the Scud rockets they provide, which require advanced
tracking methods and use of computers.
   More than 1,000 Scuds have been fired and the government has
credited them with important victories over Moslem guerrillas,
according to diplomats in Kabul and neighboring Pakistan.
   A U.S. intelligence report has alleged that Soviets in Afghan
uniforms operate the Scud base.
   Many diplomats discount the report and say Soviet soldiers no
longer are engaged in combat in Afghanistan. Some add, however,
that Soviet officers direct the civil war and the operations of
KHAD, the Afghan intelligence and secret police agency, at the
Defense and Interior ministries.
   A communist bloc journalist who visited the Defense Ministry
frequently said he discovered Soviet advisers in several
departments.
   ``Any country that is supplying billions of dollars a year to
another country is not going to sit by and let that country direct
its war effort,'' one diplomat said.
   Such influence by the Soviets over Afghanistan's security,
politics and economy has created problems between the two
governments.
   Afghan officials say privately that Soviet officials tend to
treat them like colonial subjects, and a recent incident
illustrates the point.
   Journalists were taken to a battlefield to see captured weapons.
A Soviet bodyguard armed with grenades, an assault rifle and seven
clips of ammunition accompanied a Soviet television crew.
   During the helicopter flight to Lalandar, 12 miles south of
Kabul, the bodyguard, dressed in blue jeans and a combat jacket,
ordered an Afghan officer to give up his seat and barked commands
to the pilot.
   When a Swiss journalist snapped his photograph, the guard
grabbed the camera and exposed the film.
   The journalist appealed to officials from the Foreign Ministry,
who said they could do nothing. The ministry later protested to the
Soviet Embassy.
   And the question still remains: Who was the man in the bazaar?

<HEAD>Political Survival Rides on former Prime Minister's Campaign</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TETSUO JIMBO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NAKANOJO, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He used to be prime minister, but
Yasuhiro Nakasone campaigns as hard as a rookie these days, trying
to overcome the effects of scandal and save his political influence
with an impressive election victory.
   Only two years ago, he was completing five years in the highest
office of an economic superpower. He and Ronald Reagan, then
president of the United States, were Yasu and Ron to each other.
   Then, after he left office, the Recruit influence-buying scandal
came to light. He was forced to resign from the Liberal Democratic
Party, which has governed Japan since its formation in 1955, and is
trying a political comeback at age 71.
   ``Please give me another chance to make my way back to the
center of politics,'' he entreated a crowd of about 1,000 people,
bowing deeply. ``Japan still needs my experience and my worldwide
network.''
   He made the appeal in the municipal auditorium in the farming
country of Gunma prefecture, 100 miles north of Tokyo.
   It is not the custom for Japanese prime ministers to retire and
build libraries as monuments to their administrations.
   Instead, they become elders of the Liberal Democrats, overseeing
their successors and wielding great influence through the loyalty
of legislators they support with fund-raising.
   That process now is being questioned in Japan, and Nakasone, who
has been in politics 43 years, was hurt personally by his link to
the bribery scandal.
   Analysts and aides say his campaign for Parliament, in elections
expected early next year, is crucial to his political survival.
   ``He faces an uphill battle because he needs not only to be
re-elected ... but must win overwhelmingly if he is ever to come
back into the political limelight,'' said Toshio Yamaguchi, a
member of Parliament and Nakasone aide.
   Under Japan's multiple-seat constituency system, Nakasone is not
only running against opposition candidates, but against prominent
people in his own former party.
   His constituency has four seats, but each voter chooses only one
candidate and the top four are declared winners.
   Those four seats are held by Nakasone; former Prime Minister
Takeo Fukuda; Keizo Obuchi, former chief Cabinet secretary; and
Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary-general of the opposition Socialist
Party.
   Fukuda is retiring at age 84 and plans to hand his mandate to
his son Yasuo.
   All the incumbents are powerful vote-getters in the
constituency, and the Socialists, in a break with their past
practice, plan to run a second candidate.
   A party official said privately that the Socialists want to
``force Nakasone out of Parliament and they are working to take a
bite out of Nakasone's votes little by little.''
   Failure to score at or near the top could end Nakasone's
political influence.
   Among the many other Liberal Democratic leaders sidelined by the
Recruit scandal, which began in mid-1988, are former Prime Minister
Noboru Takeshita, former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and
former Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe. Takeshita was prime minister
when the scandal was revealed.
   Nakasone was especially affected because the activities that
caused the scandal began while he was prime minister. Two aides
face trial on charges of accepting bribes from Recruit Co., an
information conglomerate accused of trying to buy influence with
huge donations and insider stock deals.
   A dozen politicians, bureaucrats and Recruit executives were
indicted for bribery.
   Recruit made large donations to Nakasone, but prosecutors
declared them legal and Nakasone to be innocent of wrongdoing.
   ``I had no link to Recruit and it was proven by prosecutors,''
he told his constituents. ``I was victimized badly by mass media
and the public because I was an unusually strong leader for a
Japanese prime minister. During my term in office, I stepped into
many areas most past leaders dared not touch.''
   In May, Nakasone was embarrassed publicly when the government
and Liberal Democratic Party bowed to the opposition and summoned
him to Parliament to testify about the Recruit affair.
   He subsequently resigned from the party and, as a consequence,
lost the leadership of his party faction.
   Analysts say Nakasone probably never will regain the influence
he had, even if he rejoins the party, because his power base within
it is crumbling. It is considered only a matter of time until
Michio Watanabe, an ambitious disciple of Nakasone, takes over his
old faction.
   The former prime minister had hoped to remain prominent in
foreign affairs through a government-supported think tank he
established. That plan foundered when the Recruit scandal dried up
corporate contributions to his World Peace Research Institute.
   Although Nakasone believes he has a chance to start over,
political analyst Soichiro Tawara said an election victory would
only delay his retirement and ``save a little piece of his pride.''
   ``I don't think the Japanese general public is as generous as
Nakasone and his aides wish,'' he said. ``It is certain that most
Japanese share the view that Nakasone's time is over, and one
election can't change the flow.''

<HEAD>Wall Streeters Tout `Yearend Rally'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also on financial wires.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wall Street is hoping for some help from the
calendar soon to pull the stock market out of its doldrums of the
past couple of months.
   This year, perhaps more vehemently than most, the slumping
securities industry is starting to talk up the ``yearend rally,'' a
phenomenon whose regularity and reliability depends on whose
arithmetic you use.
   Experienced investors naturally tend to be leery of any
mechanical, formulaic approach to forecasting the ups and downs of
the stock market.
   So if you try to tell them stocks have a tendency to do well in
some specified period, your odds of making much of an impression
are pretty long.
   Nevertheless, advocates of the yearend-rally doctrine say there
are some sound logical reasons in favor of owning stocks over the
next couple of months.
   As December passes, they maintain, downward pressure begins to
ease on any issues that are being dumped for yearend tax purposes,
or by investing institutions such as pension-fund managers readying
their portfolios for annual reports to their bosses and customers.
   Once January arrives, those same institutions presumably must
map out their plans for the year ahead and put new cash they have
received to work.
   These forces often are offered as partial explanations for the
so-called January effect, defined by investment advisor Yale Hirsch
as ``the unmistakeable tendency for certain stocks to have much
larger gains in January than in the other months of the year.''
   Though it is still the subject of much contention among
analysts, the January effect has gained a significant following
among investors in recent years.
   Indeed, there has been evidence that traders trying to buy
stocks ahead of the January wave over the past few years have
started to move it at least part way into December.
   ``The mid-November to early-January period has been the
best-performing segment of the year for the market over the last
few decades,'' asserts Norman Fosback, editor of the advisory
publication Market Logic.
   For those who subscribe to this view, one popular strategy for
exploiting it starts with the list of stocks at new 12-month lows
around mid-December.
   The issues, the reasoning goes, are artificially depressed in
the waning weeks of the year by tax selling and other seasonal
pressures. So it's not unreasonable to hope that they will rebound
early in the new year once that weight is lifted.
   Statistical studies by Hirsch show this presumption has been
borne out most of the time since the mid-1960s _ but not always.
   In the market rallies of early 1975 and early 1976, for example,
stocks from the Dec. 15 new-low list rose more than twice as much
as the overall market by Feb. 15.
   Even in the few years when the Dec. 15 lows showed further
losses two months later, their declines were generally smaller than
that of the market as a whole.
   The spell was broken in early 1986. The Dec. 15 lows from 1985,
which numbered only four, were further battered by plunging world
oil prices.
   The magic seemed to be back last winter, however. By Hirsch's
reckoning, the 23 New York Stock Exchange issues at new lows on
Dec. 15 sported an average gain of 13.2 percent two months later,
outstripping a 6.8 percent rise for the NYSE's composite index over
the same period.
   The odds of success in such speculative trading endeavors are
stacked against the small investor. But for those with an interest
in such things, whether such a scavenger strategy has any rewards
left looks to be in for a pretty fair test this time around.
   The recent new-low list of NYSE stocks, just a few weeks ahead
of Dec. 15, has included several dozen names, ranging from blue
chips to companies in bankruptcy proceedings.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev broke the mold of dour,
intransigent Soviet leaders during his first foray onto the world
stage, and he's been surprising now-wary Western counterparts ever
since his 1985 summit with Ronald Reagan.
   Based on his past performance, there's every reason to believe
that the 58-year-old Gorbachev might spring a surprise on President
Bush when the two meet off Malta on Dec. 2 and 3 _ so much so that
White House officials say extensive preparations are under way to
prepare the American president for anything that might be thrown at
him.
   Gorbachev's reform policies in the Soviet Union and Eastern
Europe have been surprising enough to Americans. His style leans to
the unexpected, as well.
   When Gorbachev and Reagan posed for pictures at the start of
their meeting in Geneva four years ago, the American president kept
mum, heeding his advisers' counsel not to take a chance on spoiling
the atmosphere of his first U.S.-Soviet summit with an offhand
remark.
   The Russian showed no such caution.
   When a reporter told Gorbachev he had been described by a fellow
Soviet official as a man with a nice smile but iron teeth,
Gorbachev replied: ``I'm still using my own teeth, but as to the
substance of your question, both the president and I have good
grounds to believe we can have a good talk.''
   Later the same day, after his tete-a-tete with Reagan stretched
well beyond the carefully choreographed schedule, the Soviet leader
broke a comment blackout imposed by both sides. ``I think we will
have a good relationship,'' he said.
   At the last snap summit, in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, the
United States went prepared to negotiate the framework for a treaty
reducing intermediate-range nuclear missiles. Gorbachev instead
proposed eliminating all nuclear weapons in all categories.
   Reagan took him up on the challenge, and the two men engaged in
what was later described as history's highest-stakes poker game,
seeing and raising each other one weapons category after another
until they stumbled over the last chip: Reagan's beloved Star Wars
plan.
   The American refused to concede; the Soviet insisted it was all
or nothing. And nothing it was.
   Bush's advisers have let it be known the new U.S. president will
not let himself be drawn into a game like that at the summit off
Malta.
   But as recently as last May, when Secretary of State James A.
Baker III went to Moscow expecting to set a date for the next
U.S.-Soviet summit, Gorbachev caught the new foreign policy chief
off guard with a bold new offer of substantial cuts in conventional
forces in Europe.
   The initiative broke a years-old logjam over how to count and
reduce the two sides' non-nuclear ground and air forces in Europe.
But it embarrassed Baker, who was unprepared for such a move, and
gave Gorbachev a public relations coup.
   Bush, facing criticism that he was slow and indecisive in
developing a policy toward the Soviet Union, recovered at the end
of the month with his own conventional arms proposal announced at a
NATO summit in Brussels.
   But six weeks later, Gorbachev pulled another trick out of his
hat.
   As the leaders of the seven great industrial democracies
gathered in Paris for their annual economic summit, they received a
letter from Gorbachev appealing for entry to the world economic
community.
   After decades of cold war and economic rivalry, the Soviet chief
wrote that his effort to restructure the Soviet economic and
society ``is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and
entire participation in the world economy.''
   His letter instantly became the central focus of the summit
talks.

<TEXT>
   It was New Year's Day 1949, and soprano Lily
Pons was nearing the end of the mad scene from ``Lucia di
Lammermoor'' on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House.
   Reaching for one of the fiendishly difficult high F's that were
her trademark in the role, the diminutive French diva fell short,
emitting what a New York Times reviewer later called ``a blemished
final tone.''
   But radio listeners who heard a tape-delayed broadcast of the
Donizetti opera the next day never detected a false note. In its
place, engineers had spliced in another high F from the same aria _
one that Miss Pons had hit squarely on the mark.
   The disparity between the reviews and the radio caused an uproar
in the music world.
   Texaco, sponsor of the Saturday matinee broadcasts, had known
that many stations would delay ``Lucia'' because it conflicted with
the Rose Bowl football game. But the incident helped bring such
tape-delays into disrepute, and eventually a special network was
set up just for the opera series. One requirement for membership:
Stations had to agree to carry all performances live.
   On Dec. 2, more than 300 stations in the United States and
Canada will be doing just that, as Texaco inaugurates its 50th
season sponsoring Met broadcasts _ the longest continuous national
sponsorship of a program in radio history.
   By the end of the season, Texaco will have aired 990
performances of 124 different operas, without commercial
interruption. The company now spends $3.5 million a year on the
broadcasts, which the Met estimates are heard by 2 million to 6
million people.
   For Texaco, the close identification with one of the nation's
most cherished cultural institutions has proved a public relations
dream worth every dollar.
   ``There is nothing new about the principle on which we acted in
merging oil and opera,'' company President W.S.S. Rodgers said at
the time of its initial broadcast _ Mozart's ``Le Nozze di Figaro''
on Dec. 7, 1940. ``American business has long acted on the policy
of success through service to the greatest number.''
   In the years since then, Texaco radio audiences have thrilled to
virtually all of the world's leading opera singers in their prime _
from Kirsten Flagstad and Lauritz Melchior to Birgit Nilsson and
Jon Vickers, from Licia Albanese and Eleanor Steber to Maria Callas
and Joan Sutherland, from Richard Tucker and Jussi Bjoerling to
Luciano Pavarotti and Placido Domingo.
   They have occasionally heard history in the making, as when the
great comic basso Salvatore Baccaloni made his debut on the very
first broadcast. Or on the broadcast of Feb. 9, 1974, when a New
Zealand soprano named Kiri Te Kanawa made an unscheduled debut as a
last-minute substitute for Teresa Stratas in Verdi's ``Otello.''
   And they have been witness to tragedy, as on the broadcast of
Jan. 23, 1988, when an 82-year-old vocal coach jumped to his death
from a balcony during intermission after Act 2 of Verdi's
``Macbeth.''
   The announcer who conveyed that grim news to the radio audience
was Peter Allen, who is launching his 15th season in the broadcast
booth behind the Grand Tier. That stint might normally qualify him
as an institution, were it not for the astonishing record of his
predecessor, the legendary Milton Cross, who presided over the
broadcasts from their pre-Texaco days in the 1930s until his death
in 1975.
   ``I had auditioned because they thought Mr. Cross might want to
retire,'' recalled Allen, who at the time was a staff announcer for
classical radio station WQXR. ``I used to be a subscriber to the
opera myself. To take over his job was more than anything I had
dreamed of.''
   Allen said he prepares for each week's broadcast by doing
research on the operas and composers, attending dress rehearsals
and even prowling around the stage to inspect the scenery.
   ``I wander all over the place looking for details, so I can try
to give the listeners a picture of what they're missing,'' Allen
said. ``Sometime I even notice things that most people in the
auditorium don't. Like the cafe scene of `La Boheme,' where Franco
Zeffirelli has used real street posters from 19th century Paris,
advertisements for laxatives and lingerie.''
   Allen also tries to anticipate things the radio audience might
hear that wouldn't make sense to them without some explanation.
   ``I tell them that Florestan's chains will rattle in the prison
scene in `Fidelio' and that the audience will laugh when the
inventor's workshop comes to life in `Tales of Hoffmann,''' he said.
   At broadcast time, he has one constant companion in the booth _
his wife, Sylvia.
   ``Thank goodness she always sits next to me,'' Allen said.
``During the centennial gala I was introducing a conductor, and I
either said Leonard Bernstein when I meant James Levine or vice
versa. She kicked me and I was able to recover before the baton
came down.''
   Allen said his most exciting challenge came during a 1987
performance of Wagner's ``Parsifal.''
   ``It was the middle of the first act, and suddenly I heard:
`Curtain coming down.' I barely had time to shut the door and put
on my earphones when the music stopped and I had to go on.''
   Part of the stage that was supposed to move forward mechanically
for a scene change had snagged, and it took technicians 23 minutes
to move it into place by hand.
   ``Luckily, I had lots of written material ready,'' Allen said.
``Since you never know what the intermission guests will say, I
don't want to anticipate or contradict them. So I look for
something relevant, interesting, but out of the way.''
   On that occasion, Allen learnedly discussed how much Puccini
loved ``Parsifal'' and the Met's role in breaking the Wagner
family's ban on having the opera performed outside Bayreuth,
Germany.
   The first broadcast this year will be the Met Marathon, a
four-hour program featuring recorded excerpts from the 1940-41
season, and a Singers Roundtable with performers who were at the
Met at that time, including Rose Bampton, Eleanor Steber and Rise
Stevens.
   Regular broadcasts begin Dec. 9 with Richard Strauss' ``Die Frau
Ohne Schatten,'' and continue through April 21. At intermission
each week, Edward Downes will again preside over the Texaco Opera
Quiz as he has for 32 years. Other intermission features will
include analyses of the day's operas, presented by such favorites
as impresario Boris Goldovsky, who is celebrating his 45th season
on the broadcasts.

<HEAD>Malta Hopes To Push Own Prosperity While Aiding Cause of Peace</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   This young nation hewn from a rocky
Mediterranean archipelago hopes to use its fleeting moment at
superpower center stage to boost its own prosperity as well as play
a part in the cause of peace.
   ``We, as the Americans would say, are about to play the biggest
and most important ball game of our times,'' says government
tourism official Michael Refalo, anticipating next weekend's summit
talks between President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev aboard ships in Maltese waters.
   ``I will go so far as to say that much of our future prospects .
.. depend on the image which we portray of ourselves and project
during these momentous days,'' Refalo said.
   The potential for a public relations bonanza is obvious. Most of
the 2,000 reporters expected to cover the summit will not get to
the U.S. and Soviet warships where Bush and Gorbachev will hold
their talks. They will be left behind on land, with time to
discover Malta.
   Along with the opportunity for Malta, comes a potential for
difficulties.
   The opposition Socialist Party, whose relations with the
governing Nationalist Party are always strained and sometimes
violent, has scheduled an anti-nuclear demonstration during the
summit and invited a delegation from Moammar Gadhafi's Libya to
take part. Gadhafi, a foe of the United States, has said he opposes
the summit meeting on foreign warships in the Mediterranean.
   Malta, which lies in the Mediterranean Sea between Italy and
Libya, is off the beaten path for superpower diplomacy, and both
visiting presidents plan visits with Prime Minister Edward Fenech
Adami.
   Bush will be the first U.S. president to visit since Franklin D.
Roosevelt stopped here 44 years ago en route to a World War II
summit in Yalta in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev's visit will be the
first by a Soviet leader.
   Malta's location has made it desirable to a long list of
conquerors stretching back 2,000 years and including the
Phoenicians, Carthaginians and Romans. Its other foreign rulers
have included the Spanish, the crusading Knights of Malta, Napoleon
and finally the British.
   The summit comes as Malta, which became independent from Britain
25 years ago, is beginning a new push for industry and tourism by
promoting itself as an international conference center.
   The summit comes, too, at a time when the island is beginning a
drive to become ``the Switzerland of the Mediterranean'' as a
financial and trading center, said Joseph Fenech, the government
minister responsible for offshore banking and maritime affairs.
   ``We feel that if Malta is good both for Bush and Gorbachev, it
is good for any prospective investor with whom together we shall
build the success of our future as a maritime state and a financial
and trading center,'' he said.
   The guided missile cruiser USS Belknap and the Soviet missile
cruiser Slava are expected to anchor in Marsaxlokk Bay, within
sight of fishing villages on the eastern end of the island and
about 220 miles north of Tripoli, Libya.
   There are some worries among local officials about Malta's own
volatile brand of politics and about the reaction of Libya.
   Opposition leader Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici traveled to Libya in
mid-November for meetings with Gadhafi, and when he returned he
called for Gorbachev and Bush to include Mediterranean tensions on
their agenda.
   Enmity between the United States and Libya reached a peak with
the April 1986 U.S. bombing raids on Tripoli and Benghazi, attacks
the United States declared were reprisals for Libyan acts of
terrorism. Published reports said Maltese air traffic controllers
passed on a warning to Libya shortly before the American planes
made their strike.
   Still, U.S. officials in Malta say they see no special security
problem from Libyans, who travel freely in Malta.
   Malta's conservative Nationalist government has downgraded
political and military relations with Libya since taking power in
1987 and has sought to strengthen its economic ties with the West.
While remaining officially nonaligned, it has sought to take a
place among the family of Western European nations.
   Fenech Adami flew to Bonn on Nov. 19 for six days of talks with
West German leaders, including Chancellor Helmut Kohl, on the
superpower summit and on Malta's plan to apply for full membership
in the European Economic Community. Malta currently has an
association agreement with the Common Market and conducts most of
its trade with EC countries, particularly West Germany, Italy and
Britain.
   The Maltese hope their contributions to the summit can help
foster their image as an island of peace.
   ``The holding of the summit here is not only an honor to all
Maltese, but presents above all the greatest challenge our country
and people have had to meet in peacetime,'' said the government's
Refalo.

<HEAD>Flight Attendants, Pilots Quit Strike; Job Prospects Uncertain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines machinists were left alone on the
picket lines after pilots and flight attendants abandoned their
8{-month strike, but even for the unions that surrendered, labor
peace remained elusive.
   Eastern warned members of the Air Line Pilots Association and
the attendants' Transport Workers Union they won't necessarily get
their old jobs back.
   ``It is regrettable that they didn't come to this conclusion
earlier,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Thursday. ``They
didn't, so we had to go out and hire permanent replacements.''
   The 2,200 striking pilots ended their strike Wednesday, after
President Bush vetoed a bill to create a congressional advisory
committee on Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization five days after the strike began March 4.
   The 6,000-member flight attendants' union followed suit later
that day. That left just the 8,500-member Machinists union, which
began the bitter strike.
   Union leaders contend that Eastern's bankruptcy, ordered by
parent Texas Air Corp., was a tactic to break the unions.
   On the picket lines in Atlanta, machinists said they felt
abandoned, but were determined to continue what has at times taken
on the look of a personal battle between unionists and Texas Air
Chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   ``Everybody out here is pretty much in shock,'' said Steve D.
Mack, a striking ramp worker.
   Tony Chapman, vice president of the Machinists' Atlanta branch,
said his union wouldn't follow the pilots.
   ``We will continue,'' Chapman said. ``We started this strike.
The pilots acted on their own.''
   Members at the union local across the street from Eastern
headquarters in Miami chanted, ``Strike! Strike! Strike!'' after
receiving word of the settlements late Wednesday.
   Eastern said it will fight to keep replacement workers hired
during the strike. Pilots and flight attendants ready to return to
work were asked to sign a recall list at Eastern, which said it
would take them back as openings occurred.
   Eastern doesn't have jobs for the 2,200 striking pilots, said
Ms. Ceremsak. She said Eastern has 1,850 pilots, including 850
union members who crossed picket lines, and there are already 100
union pilots on a recall list.
   The number of openings for flight attendants wasn't immediately
available, but Nancy Currier, vice president of Transport Workers
Local 553 in Miami, said 1,500 union attendants had crossed picket
lines.
   The pilots and attendants are prepared to take Eastern to court
to win back jobs, Ms. Currier said.
   ``We don't agree with (Eastern's) position and our lawyers don't
agree with their position,'' Ms. Currier said.
   The strike began after 1{ years of federally mediated talks
between Eastern and the Machinists union stalemated over demands
for $150 million in wage cuts and work-rule changes.
   The other unions joined the strike, in part out of the suspicion
that Texas Air, which bought Eastern in 1986, wanted only to bust
the unions and milk cash from Eastern.
   Texas Air, which broke strikes and unions at Continental
Airlines in 1983, infuriated the Eastern unions by spinning
Eastern's computer reservations system off into a subsidiary and
selling its prized Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump.
   Lorenzo and other Eastern executives said they had taken over a
company with severe financial problems and unreasonable labor costs
and had to make cuts with or without the unions.
   Eastern, which operated nearly 1,100 daily flights before the
strike, has said it is rebuilding into an efficient carrier that
will be up to 90 percent of its pre-strike size when it emerges
from Chapter 11 next year.

<HEAD>Pacific Region Governments Sign Convention on Driftnet Fishing</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Representatives from 20 South
Pacific nations today endorsed a pact aimed at banning the huge,
60-mile-long drift nets that environmentalists say are robbing the
ocean of marine life.
   The Japanese government and the Taiwanese fishing industry, main
users of the fishing technique, will be asked on Monday to accept
the convention, which bans driftnet fishing across large areas of
the Pacific.
   Delegates attending a week-long meeting in Wellington pledged to
work to eliminate drift net fishing from the region.
   Most governments in the area already have barred drift net boats
from their waters.
   The area covered by the convention stretches from the Marshall
Islands in the north, French Polynesia in the east, New Zealand in
the south and Australia in the west.
   But the regional governments do not have the power to force the
driftnetters from international waters, where they string their
nets across the tuna migration paths.
   Philipp Muller, chairman of the Pacific Forum Fisheries Agency,
told reporters there had been ``signs of co-operation'' from Japan
and Taiwan but added: ``They will want to take the protocols back
home and there will be long discussions.''
   Japanese diplomats are attending the conference and a delegation
from the Taiwan Deepsea Tuna Fishing Boat Owners and Exporters
Association is due to arrive on Monday.
   Countries represented at the conference are to sign the
convention at government level within the next few weeks, binding
themselves to taking action if they have not already done so.
   The regional governments fear the driftnetters will seriously
deplete albacore tuna stocks within two years, endangering the
fragile economies of island states which depend on fishing.
   A U.S. Senate move Wednesday and a Taiwanese pledge to cut its
South Pacific fleet have raised hopes the technique could be
outlawed or discouraged.
   Senior Taiwanese officials have said the country would send 24
drift net boats into South Pacific this season, compared with 60
last year.
   The Senate has voted to bar imports of tuna caught by the drift
net fishing, which is known as ``wall of death'' fishing because
the 60-mile nets entrap and suffocate virtually everything in their
path.
   The bill is aimed mainly at tuna imported from Japan and Taiwan,
worth about $250 million last year.
   South Pacific countries represented at the conference include
American Samoa, Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, French Polynesia, Kiribati, Marshall Islands,
Nauru, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea,
Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Near $40 Billion Mark</HEAD>

   The nation's exports of farm products in the
fiscal year that ended on Sept. 30 came close to the $40 billion
forecast by Agriculture Department experts three months ago.
   According to a detailed report by the department's Economic
Research Service, the value of shipments in the 1989 fiscal year
was almost $39.7 billion, up 12 percent from $35.3 billion in 1988.
   That was the biggest export value since the record $43.8 billion
in 1981. It also marked the third consecutive year-to-year increase
since exports plunged to $26.3 billion in 1986.
   Officials said the 1989 export surge came despite a sharp
cutback in the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP,
which subsidizes selected exports to designated overseas markets.
   Agricultural imports, meanwhile, were valued at a record $21.5
billion, up from about $21 billion in 1988, the previous high.
Vegetables, grain and grain products, sugar and rubber showed the
largest increases, the report said.
   As expected, the actual volume of 1989 exports of key
commodities was down from the previous year. But higher ``unit''
prices for many items offset the decline in shipment tonnages.
   For example, total U.S. wheat exports dropped to 37.7 million
metric tons from 40.5 million tons in 1988, despite huge shipments
to the Soviet Union and China. The value, boosted by higher market
prices, rose to more than $6 billion from $4.5 billion in 1988.
   Corn exports in 1989 jumped 15 percent from 1988 to 50.7 million
tons, the most in a year since 1981. That included a record 15.6
million tons shipped to the Soviets. Total shipments were worth
$6.1 billion, up from $4.32 billion in 1988.
   Soybean exports in 1989 were reported at 14.1 million tons, down
from 21.1 million tons in 1988, the lowest since 1975. The export
value, at $4.08 billion, was down from $5.07 billion.
   Exports of cotton totaled 1.4 million tons, or 6.6 million
bales, the highest level in five years, the report said. Value,
reflecting lower prices, dropped to $2.04 billion from $2.14
billion in 1988.
   The analysis also showed that spending for export subsidies
under EEP dropped 15 percent in 1989 to less than $2.8 billion from
nearly $3.3 billion in 1988.
   In terms of commodities, the EEP subsidies covered less than
15.9 million tons of wheat, down almost 40 percent from 26.3
million tons subsidized in 1988.
   All commodities authorized under the program were cut back,
according to the report. Others included:
   _Rice, 20,000 tons in 1989, down 83 percent from 120,000 in 1988.
   _Barley, 529,000 tons, down 69 percent from 1.7 million.
   _Grain sorghum, none in 1989 and 213,000 tons in 1988.
   _Vegetable oils, 105,000 tons, down 71 percent from 13,000.
   _Frozen poultry, 8,000 tons, down 39 percent from 13,000.
   _Eggs, 4.2 million dozen, down 61 percent from 10.75 million.
   _Cattle, none, compared with 12,000 head in 1988.

   An Agriculture Department scientist has
developed a sure-fire test to detect a costly virus in fruit tree
seedlings.
   Plant pathologist Ahmed F. Hadidi of the department's
Agricultural Research Service said the test detects the presence of
tomato ringspot 100 percent of the time, compared with current
diagnostic procedures that are only about 60 percent reliable.
   The virus causes stem pitting disease of stone fruits like
peaches, and union necrosis disease of apples. These are among the
most common diseases of commercial orchards on the East Coast, the
agency said.
   Each year the virus is responsible for millions of dollars in
losses of peach, nectarine, prune and apple trees, as well as heavy
damage to grapes and raspberries.
   ``In the past, it has been a difficult and sometimes impossible
virus to diagnose in fruit crops,'' said Hadidi, who works at the
agency's National Plant Germplasm Quarantine Laboratory in
Beltsville, Md. ``Fruit trees can be infected with the virus for a
few years before they exhibit symptoms of the disease, which are
then followed by the tree's decline and death.''
   Hadidi said he expects that by the time it is marketed as a
commercial kit it will be cheap enough to use for screening trees
for the virus. A patent application is being filed, a step toward
commercial development.

<TEXT>
   The Detroit News and the Detroit Free Press, set
to partially merge Monday, could be hit by strikes unless progress
is made in contract talks over the weekend, union leaders warned.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Nov. 13 approved a merger of the daily
newspapers' business, production and advertising staffs. The
reporting and editing staffs are to remain separate.
   More than 2,000 Free Press and News employees are to start
working Monday for the Detroit Newspaper Agency, which will oversee
the newspapers' joint operating agreement.
   The change means the papers' 11 unions must negotiate new
contracts with the agency and the papers. Those negotiations were
scheduled to resume today after a Thanksgiving recess.
   Leaders of six of the newspapers' 11 unions have agreed to
bargain jointly.
   ``If they intend to implement (the joint operating agreement) on
Monday, we'll have a contract or be on strike,'' said Tom Brennan,
president of Local 13N of the Graphic Communications International
Union. The local represents press operators and paper handlers at
both newspapers.
   Free Press Publisher Robert Hall expressed optimism the talks
would succeed.
   ``I'm still confident that we can get a contract by Sunday,''
Hall said.
   At least five of the unions scheduled weekend membership
meetings, and members of three of those unions planned to take
strike-authorization votes.
   Under the joint operating agreement, the papers were expected to
cut their joint payroll by about 450 employees. Most of the cuts
were being made through buyouts or early retirement, but newspaper
officials said as many as 30 employees could be involuntarily laid
off.

   At noon local time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was down 0.2 point at 2,220.3.
   Continued weakness in sterling against the West German mark
fueled concerns about a possible hike in British interest rates.
That hampered share prices, dealers said.

   Baltica said the deal, being discussed with the French insurance

   Trading in Baltica Holding and Baltica Insurance shares on the
Copenhagen and London stock exchanges was suspended Friday.

negotiations in respect of participation in a major European
cooperation with ... Groupe Victoire and Suez.''
   The deal will be discussed in a Baltic board meeting on Tuesday.
   Baltica denied there was any connection between recent rumors
that a hostile investor was buying up its shares and the talks with
the French concern.

<HEAD>Fair Trade Commission Issues Warning Over One-Yen Bids</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Fair Trade Commission on Friday issued
stern warnings to two Japanese computer manufacturers that may have
engaged in unfair trade practices by bidding one yen on local
government projects.
   After several weeks' investigation, the commission decided the
bids of one yen, the equivalent of 0.7 cent, made by Fujitsu Ltd.
and NEC Corp. required ``stern warnings,'' said Takashi Yamamoto of
the FTC's Trade Practices Division.
   The commission said the low bids, made on contracts to design
computer software for several city governments, were judged likely
to be ``unjust low-price sales'' and ``customer inducement by
unjust benefits,'' under the Unfair Trade Practices chapter of the
Anti-Monopoly Law.
   The FTC's decision stopped short of saying the bids had violated
the law but warned if the two companies make excessively low bids
again, there was a strong possibility the ``Anti-Monopoly Law would
be applicable.''
   NEC said in a statement that it had ``reflected deeply on the
social outcry over careless bidding'' and had taken measures to
ensure it would not occur again.
   Fujitsu also issued a statement saying it taken steps to prevent
such problems and repeated a request to Hiroshima and Nagano
officials to cancel the contracts won with low bids.
   Shortly after Fujitsu won a contract to design computer software
for the Hiroshima City water supply system with a one-yen bid,
several other such cases surfaced.
   Fujitsu and NEC were found to have submitted bids of one yen to
design software for libraries in Nagano City in central Japan and
for planning an information system for Wakayama prefecture in
western Japan. Fujitsu won both contracts.
   The commission said Fujitsu also won a contract to develop a
culture and educational information system for Hiroshima City with
a $700 bid and with a $70 bid won another contract to conduct a
feasibility study on a library computer system for Saitama
prefecture near Tokyo.
   ``These cases are not common, but recently there has been a
sudden increase that seems to indicate a trend,'' the commission's
statement said.
   Yamamoto said it was uncertain whether the FTC ruling would
affect the contracts. ``We cannot legally say whether the contracts
should be carried out or not. The local government officials and
Fujitsu will have to discuss that issue,'' he said.
   The deals provoked criticism over what U.S. officials charged
was weak enforcement of Japan's antitrust laws. FTC officials say
warnings are strict enough to enforce compliance with fair trade
rules.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission said
Friday it plans to propose new measures early next year to make
corporate takeovers in the 12-nation trade bloc easier.
   The Commission said in a statement that takeover bids faced
formidable legal obstacles in many member countries, but such
roadblocks could be overcome by new measures and the application of
current EC legislation.
   The executive Commission said new measures were needed to
``facilitate the restructuring of European industry'' as the 12
member states attempt to integrate their economies before the end
of 1992.
   The commission said it wants, among other things, to strengthen
the voting rights of shareholders and force bidders to outline
their plans to target companies and their employees.
   The commission wants to propose the regulations by March.
   The move followed a British demand for measures to counter an EC
proposal that would give the Commission power to block large
mergers on antitrust grounds.
   Takeover bids are becoming increasingly numerous and are
expected to continue as Europe prepares to meld into one market in
1992.
   Among the EC nations, West Germany and the Netherlands have the
highest barriers to takeover bids while takeovers are more simple
in Britain and in France.

<TEXT>
   Financial giant Primerica Corp. has agreed to
buy the loan portfolio of the U.S. consumer-lending unit of
Britain's Barclays Bank PLC in a cash deal valued at $1.35 billion,
both companies announced Friday.
   Under the agreement, Primerica's lending subsidiary, Commercial
Credit Co., will buy assets worth $1.30 billion of
BarclaysAmerican-Financial, a unit of BarclaysAmericanCorporation,
which is the U.S. subsidiary of Barclay's.
   The sale price, therefore, represents a $50 million premium over
the total value of the loan portfolio.
   Barclays said it will retain the equity in the company, which
has a book value of around $100 million.
   The acquisition, which is expected to be completed early next
year, is subject to regulatory approval.
   BarclaysAmerican-Financial, based in Charlotte, N.C.,
specializes in consumer lending with an emphasis on direct
installment and home equity loans. It employs more than 1,000 and
maintains about 220 offices in 29 states.
   Commercial Credit provides personal and home equity loans to
about 700,000 consumers through 490 lending offices in 29 states.
Its receivables totaled $3.4 billion as of Sept. 30.
   Primerica, based in New York, is a diversified financial
services company, providing, among other things, insurance,
investment banking, securities brokerage and consumer lending.

   The lite brigade is swelling. Thanksgiving
gluttony aside, American food companies are jumping on the trend of
giving shoppers the same great taste, but no fat, or cholesterol,
or sugar, or salt ....
   ``Next to foods that can be microwaved, light foods continue to
be the fastest-growing segment in the store,'' said Judy Ball,
manager of customer relations for Kroger Co., the nation's largest
supermarket chain.
   ``If two comparable products are on the shelf next to each
other, the one that says `Light' will probably sell better,'' she
said in a telephone interview from her Cincinnati office.
   One of the newest entries is the venerable Hostess Cupcake, with
the seven-loop squiggle signature on top and sugary white cream in
the middle.
   The new version, called Hostess Lights, is 97 percent fat-free,
contains no cholesterol and has fewer calories than its regular
Hostess counterpart.
   ``This allows people who are watching their diet to have a sweet
snack every once in a while without feeling guilty,'' said Pamela
Marsh, a snack nutritionist at Hostess.
   ``This allows them to have their cake and eat it too.''
   Hostess cupcakes were invented 70 years ago and helped build
Hostess' parent company, St. Louis-based Continental Baking Co.,
into the nation's largest wholesale bakery.
   Hostess Lights, the cupcake for the 1990s, will be available
around the nation in a few months. They've been on sale since
October in New York, Philadelphia, Boston and Washington, and have
fared fairly well, Marsh said.
   Rolling out more and more products that tout healthful qualities
has probably increased overall sales in the food industry, but only
slightly, said Roger Spencer, a stock analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds in Chicago.
   ``Any growth in a slow-growth industry is always welcome, but
it's certainly not anything that would bowl you over,'' Spencer
said.
   He said that overall the healthy products seem to be drawing
consumers away from their less healthy counterparts, rather than
increasing consumption of products.
   ``The skinny guys will keep buying what they've always bought
and the fat guys will use this new stuff,'' Spencer said. ``And
we'll all live to be about the same age.''
   The only problem with the food industry's urge to be healthy is
that no one has agreed on what is healthy.
   ``It's kind of confusing for consumers,'' Ball said. ``When they
pick up something that says `Light' it may not be at all what they
expect.''
   The Food and Drug Adminstration, which oversees the majority of
food products sold in supermarkets, set standards in 1980 for
low-calorie and reduced-calorie foods, but so far has no
requirements for foods labeled ``light'' or ``lite,'' said Emil
Corwin, an FDA spokesman.
   However, Corwin said, the FDA is studying possible definitions
for the ``light'' category.
   He said low-calorie foods must have no more than 40 calories per
serving, and reduced-calorie foods must be at least one-third lower
in calories.
   In 1986 the FDA proposed requirements for cholesterol-free,
low-cholesterol and reduced-cholesterol foods, Corwin said.
   Under the proposal, foods labeled ``cholesterol-free'' should
have less than 2 milligrams of cholesterol per serving;
``low-cholesterol'' should have less than 20 milligrams of
cholesterol per serving; and ``reduced-cholesterol'' should have at
least 75 percent less cholesterol than the normal serving.
   Meanwhile, other regulatory agencies like the U.S. Department of
Agriculture and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms also
are involved with their own set of guidelines for ``Lite'' beef and
``Lite'' whiskey.
   The lack of definitions is part of a broader controversy being
debated in Washington about the use of improper health claims on
products and concerns that food labels are becoming meaningless.
   ``What I always say is that the grocery aisles are becoming the
mine fields of misleading information for consumers,'' said Bruce
Silverglade, legal director of the Center for Science in the Public
Interest.
   Silverglade said the explosion of health boasts and bravado may
mean a boost in profits now, but food companies will pay for that
by alienating consumers in the long run.
   ``If unabated, consumers will disregard everything on the
label,'' he said. ``We'll be in a position of throwing out the baby
with the bathwater because people simply won't know what to
believe.''
   Hostess Lights are a good example of products that may be
walking the line between what is slick marketing and what is a
genuinely healthful alternative.
   The cupcakes come in three flavors: plain, filled with vanilla
pudding, and with a raspberry filling. They're made with a new
angel food cake recipe that doesn't use egg yolks or animal fat.
   According to the FDA's proposed guideline for ``Light'' or ``Low
Fat'' products, the reduced-calorie product should have at least
one-third fewer calories than the regular version.
   Two of the three Hostess Light cupcakes miss that mark and the
other Light cupcake, the one with plain cake, passes only because
it's a half-ounce lighter than cupcakes made with the original
recipe.
   ``Our use of the word `Light' does not fall into the
reduced-calorie category. Some people may use the term to relate to
calories, but we're not positioning this as a diet food,'' said
Marsh, a Hostess spokeswoman.
   She said the brand name Light was selected because the cupcakes
are 97 percent fat-free and they contain no cholesterol.

   The stock market gained ground today, resuming
the rally it began just before the Thanksgiving holiday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 17.49 on Wednesday,
rose 16.85 points to 2,673.63 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
735 up, 367 down and 494 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 33.35 million shares at
midmorning.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets today. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose modestly, putting their yields in the
7.86 percent-7.96 percent range.
   The drop in rates came in the wake of signs Wednesday that the
Federal Reserve had taken another step to relax its credit policy.
   Analysts said it appeared that the Fed had become a little more
aggressive lately in its efforts to cushion the impact of slowing
economic growth.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced
by modest gains in the corn market.
   Corn's strength appeared to stem in part from an Agriculture
Department report that export sales of corn rose by nearly 1.2
million metric tons last week.
   Indications that Mexico bought some U.S. corn overnight also
prompted buying, as did a USDA decisision to extend for 12 months
the 1985 corn and sorghum loans due to expire Dec. 31. The move may
keep some grain in storage that would otherwise have come onto the
market.
   Gains in the wheat market were limited by expectations for rain
in U.S. winter wheat areas early next week.
   Recent weakness in European soybean oil and meal markets kept a
lid on the soybean market.
   Trading conditions were thin this morning, with some traders
taking a long Thanksgiving weekend.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent to 1 cent higher
with the contract for delivery in December at $4.08\ a bushel; corn
was { cent to } cent higher with December at $2.39\ a bushel; oats
were \ cent to 1 higher with December at $1.47 a bushel; soybeans
were { cent to 2 cents higher with January at $5.91} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were higher in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent to .25 cent higher with December at
76.12 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent to .35 cent higher
with November at 83.70 cents a pound; hog futures were .18 cent to
.42 cent higher with December at 50.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were .03 cent to .53 cent higher with February at 63.65

   Livestock and meat futures advanced on Wednesday.

<HEAD>East European Liberalization Could Be Boon to U.S. Credit Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some economists say the changes sweeping Eastern
Europe could be a boon to U.S. credit markets, with interest rates
plunging and bond prices leaping as leaner defense budgets pare the
federal deficit.
   Others point out a potential pitfall inthe liberalization of the
East Bloc: The foreign investors who help fund the U.S. deficit by
buying Treasury bonds may be tempted to invest their money in
Eastern Europe instead, causing a U.S. credit crunch.
   Roger E. Brinner, chief economist for the consulting firm
DRI-McGraw Hill Inc., is one of the optimists.
   ``As the Treasury's needs for funds drops, so will the yields
that they're forced to pay,'' he said last week. ``If we cut back
on defense and didn't spend it elsewhere we could have up to a 2
percentage point drop in interest rates over the next five years.
That would be a 25 percent gain in the price of bonds.''
   Brinner said his calculation is based on a rule of thumb that
every $50 billion reduction in the federal deficit brings a 1
percentage point drop in interest rates.
   Already there are signs that U.S. defense spending will be cut
to help ease the deficit and pay for expensive domestic programs
President Bush has promised, such as fighting drug abuse, improving
education and reducing pollution.
   Reports that Defense Secretary Dick Cheney wants to trim defense
spending by $180 billion over the next six years sent defense
company stock prices plunging last week.
   Robert A. Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities Co.
International Inc., said the opening of the East Bloc holds many
pluses for the United States, such as a vast new outlet for U.S.
products that could ease the nation's trade deficit. But he also
points out potential trouble.
   ``Europe will tend to keep its own capital,'' he wrote in a
commentary last week. ``Capital from other parts of the world will
flow there more freely, too. The U.S., the world's major
foreign-capital-addicted country, could find itself starved for the
capital it craves. Financial flows from Japan will become ever more
important to the U.S.
   ``The potential for a disruption in flows is not a small
matter,'' he added. ``The cold war is over, but a deep chill of
another sort may lie ahead.''
   Steven Hess, an economist for First Interstate Bancorp in Los
Angeles, disputes Brusca's contention.
   ``I don't think the U.S. government will have too much
difficulty funding itself anymore than it already has because it's
going to clearly still be the benchmark for Western markets,'' he
said.
   ``I really think that investment in Eastern Europe in the near
term is not going to be so great that it would have any effect on
credit markets,'' he added.
   Doug Handler, an economist at Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp., said an
investment in Treasury bonds is not comparable to an investment in
rebuilding Eastern Europe, and so they probably are not be
competing for the same funds.
   Treasury bonds often are used for short-term investments, such
as currency hedging strategies, he said. Those putting money in
Eastern Europe most likely view it as a long-term investment.
   Handler also said a defense scaleback could have a negative
effect on the U.S. economy over the short term since it could
result in layoffs in the defense industry.
   These layoffs could depress the economy, which in turn could
reduce government revenue, possibly canceling out any
deficit-reducing effect from the defense cuts.
   However, while a weaker economy wouldn't be good for the nation
as a whole, it would most likely benefit the bond market. Bond
prices generally rise when the economy slackens on the assumption
that the Federal Reserve Board will ease interest rates. It also
benefits bonds by lessening fears of inflation.
   There's another potential impact on Western credit markets from
the liberalization in the East: the prospect that billions of
dollars in bonds might be sold in the West by the Soviet Union and
Eastern European nations to finance their reconstruction.
   In the past two years the Soviet Union has sold about $850
million in bonds in Europe. Hungary also has tapped Western bond
markets.
   But the Soviet Union is barred from borrowing in this country
until it clears up the matter of Czarist Russian debt obligations
in the United States that the Communist government reneged on after
the Russian Revolution.

<TEXT>
   The United States will allow a 13.5 percent
increase in the amount of raw sugar that can be imported from 39
countries in 1990, the Agriculture Department announced today.
   ``This change in the level of the quota is necessary to
alleviate a tightness in our sugar market caused by unexpectedly
low ending stocks and a production shortfall,'' said Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   The new import quota takes effect Monday for the period that
runs from Jan. 1, 1989, through Sept. 30, 1990. The quota was set
at 2.26 million metric tons raw value, up from 1.99 million metric
tons for 1989.
   Quotas are used to restrict the amount of foreign sugar that can
enter the United States, thus protecting domestic producers from
lower-priced foreign sugar being dumped on the U.S. market.
   The quota for Panama, 30,798 metric tons, was suspended, as was
its previous allocation, because of an export financing bill passed
by Congress earlier this year. Panama's 1989 quota was reallocated
to other countries on Sept. 12.
   Metric tons, which equal about 2,205 pounds each, became the
standard for measuring sugar quotas under terms of a new U.S.
tariff system that took effect Jan. 1.
   Yeutter also announced shipping patterns for eight countries _
Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, Guatemala and the Philippines _ which require them to
ship one-third of their sugar allocations before March 31, 1990.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills announced
country-by-country allocations for 1989. In metric tons, these
include:
   Argentina, 92,331.
   Australia, 178,221.
   Barbados, 15,031.
   Belize, 23,620.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan on Friday pledged a $150 million loan for
Poland and said it was considering other aid to Poland and Hungary
to help relieve their economic crises and promote democratic reform.
   The low-interest loan would be used for Poland's currency
stabilization program, said Mayumi Moriyama, the chief Cabinet
secretary.
   Japan is also considering loans through the Export-Import Bank
to cover trade and investment insurance for Hungary and is studying
plans to provide emergency food aid to Poland and technical
assistance to both countries, said Kenzo Oshima, director of the
Aid Policy Division at the Foreign Ministry.
   Asked why Japan was giving a loan rather than a grant, Oshima
conceded Poland probably would have been happier with a grant.
   ``It is up to each country to decide what fits,'' he said. ``The
U.S. apparently felt a grant would be more preferable. ... As far
as Japan is concerned, we felt a concessional loan would meet if
not 100 percent of their requirements, at least an important part.''
   Japan has said its relatively slow development of an aid package
for Eastern Europe by saying the region is remote from Japan and
relations had not been important while those countries had little
independence as members of the Soviet bloc.
   ``It can't be denied that part of the world is remote,'' Oshima
said. ``It is not something like China or Korea to Japan.''
   Oshima said the $150 million loan would carry at most a 3
percent interest rate and be repayable over 25 years with a
seven-year grace period. The loan would be made if agreement is
reached between Poland and the International Monetary Fund on a
plan to restructure the Polish economy.
   Poland, the only East bloc country led by a non-Communist, has
asked Western countries to support its efforts to control 800
percent inflation and to stabilize its currency.
   Western officials say Poland faces a severe food shortage this
winter without more assistance.

<TEXT>
   More than 40,000 models of a classic American
toy have been recalled because paint used on them may contain too
much lead, according to the Consumer Product Safety Commission.
   The agency also says hundreds of thousands of clown dolls are
being recalled because they pose a choking hazard.
   The makers of ``Slinky'' animal pull toys, a variation on the
standard accordion-like wired toy, are voluntarily recalling them
because the red paint used on the eyes, tongue and cheeks may
contain a higher percentage of lead paint than the agency allows.
   CPSC standards limit to .06 percent the lead content of paint
used on children's items.
   The 43,000 Slinky toys sold since 1986, have red and white pull
cords and come in the form of a train, worm, seal, frog,
caterpillar, dalmation and kitten. They are made by James
Industries Inc. of Hollidaysburg, Pa.
   The CPSC also said 234,000 dolls manufactured by the Omaha-based
Oriental Trading Co. and sold through mail order catalogues as the
``Dress Up Clown'' or ``Funny Clown'' were recalled because they
have small parts that present a choking risk to young children.
   The agency said the 13-inch dolls, used to teach children to
dress themselves, have zipper clasps, buttons and buckles that came
off during standard tests.
   ``These small parts make the dolls banned hazardous substances
because they present a choking, ingestion and aspiration hazard to
children,'' the agency said in a written statement.
   There have been no reported injuries associated with either toy.
   Consumers may return the toys to the place of purchase for a
full refund.

<HEAD>Annual Rite Begins: Shoppers Stream Into Stores</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Customers clutching credit cards and wish lists joined by
children eager for a glimpse of Santa Claus crammed into stores
around the country today in the traditional start of the
post-Thanksgiving buying spree.
   Old-fashioned holiday spirit mixed with a hunger for bargains
sent shoppers and browsers out in force, promising to produce a day
worthy of its billing as the busiest one of the year for merchants.
   Managers in many areas reported customers lined up outside
waiting for stores to open, a hopeful sign in the most crucial
season of a year that so far has been slow for retailers.
   At Bloomingdale's department store in Manhattan, customers lined
up early in numbingly cold weather to get a jump on their holiday
shopping and surged inside when the doors opened at 9 a.m.
   ``We're filling up with people rapidly,'' Bloomingdale's
spokeswoman Ann Stock said. ``As always, we expect this to be the
busiest day of the year.''
   Early shoppers at Bloomingdale's grabbed for mittens, gloves,
scarves and hats. Others made a beeline for the coat department.
New York's first Thanksgiving snowfall in 51 years combined with
sub-freezing temperatures apparently put people in the mood to buy
warm clothing.
   Shoppers streamed into suburban malls and downtowns nationwide
hoping to get as much gift buying done as possible at the start of
the peak shopping season. Big markdowns on merchandise at some
troubled stores lured bargain-hunters while shoppers elsewhere
scanned the aisles for hard-to-find items, such as the popular
Nintendo video games.
   The Santa Claus at Raleigh, N.C.'s Crabtree Valley Mall said
most of the several dozen children that had confided their requests
to him this morning asked for Nintendo items.
   The six B. Altman &amp; Co. department stores in New York, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania that are closing down _ financially
struggling parent company Hooker Corp. couldn't find a buyer for
the chain _ drew hordes of people to their liquidation sales.
   The crowd clamoring to get inside B. Altman's main store in
Manhattan was so heavy that shoppers had to be admitted in shifts.
   ``We're having an unbelievable day,'' said Brenda Smith,
secretary for the manager at Altman's at The Mall at Short Hills in
New Jersey. At the Paramus, N.J., mall, an Altman's employee said
the store was so busy none of the managers were available to talk.
   Almost half of a retailer's annual business is done in the weeks
between Thanksgiving and Christmas.
   Most retailers and industry analysts are expecting this year to
be a time of cautious spending on expensive, long-lasting goods,
such as home appliances. Overall retail sales are predicted to rise
only about 5.5 percent over last year, compared with 1988's
surprisingly strong 9 percent gain.
   Typically there is a crush of shopping done in the days just
after Thanksgiving and then a long lull until the final, frantic
days just before Christmas.
   Merchants in many places were providing incentives to people
that showed up early.
   In New Orleans, early arrivers to St. Charles Street were
offered coffee and donuts. One large department store in Sioux
Falls, S.D., offered special prizes inside Cracker Jack boxes for
early arrivals.
   Shirley Larsen, a clerk at a Sioux Falls clothing store, said:
``We always have merchandise on sale, but today in order to get
people to come in, there are coupons we're handing out at the
door,'' she said.
   The Acadiana Mall in Lafayette, La., brimmed with shoppers by
midmorning and marketing director Sherry Bouttee fretted that the
parking lot might not be able to handle the holiday traffic.

   International and domestic flights to
and from Copenhagen's Kastrup airport were disrupted Friday due to
a strike by Scandinavian Airlines workers.
   ``The situation is chaotic,'' said the duty officer at Kastrup
International Airport, the hub of air traffic in Scandinavia.
   All Scandinavian Airlines System flights to and from Kastrup
were suspended, and flights by other international carriers were
delayed or canceled, the duty officer said.
   Airport employees stopped work in a sympathy with SAS Danish
cabin personnel who have been locked in a dispute with the airline
over promotions.
   SAS is the joint flag carrier of Denmark, Sweden and Norway.
   Flight attendants refuse to accept a new procedure SAS devised
for appointing pursers in which candidates for the jobs are placed
on separate national lists instead of the joint-Scandinavian lists
used until now.
   SAS management has refused to reconsider its decision on hiring
of pursers.
   The striking Danish cabin personnel say the new procedure is
part of a strategy by SAS to ``thin out'' its personnel in
Copenhagen and Oslo. The airline's headquarters is in Stockholm.

<HEAD>China's Panda Motor Says Production Will Begin By Yearend 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRIL JONES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $1 billion infusion is putting Panda Motor
Corp., China's largest foreign-funded investment project, on track
to begin auto production by the end of next year, an official news
report said Friday.
   American Panda Motor Co., which is affiliated with South Korea's
Unification Church, is investing $1 billion in the project, which
will produce 300,000 cars a year _ all for export _ by 1995, the
People's Daily said.
   Chinese government reports said previously that U.S. investors
were contributing $250 million to the project.
   The People's Daily said investors from 20 countries and
``regions'' were involved in the project, but gave no further
details.
   The Panda Motor factory is being built in Huizhou, a small city
east of Canton, the capital of southern Guangdong province.
   American Panda Motor has its head office in Arlington, Va. One
of its main backers is Charles Kim, a Korean-American who formerly
was with the U.S. Small Business Administration, according to
officials in Beijing and Canton.
   Little else is known about American Panda, the officials say.
   ``They're tied in with the Tong-il (Unification) Group,'' said a
foreign commercial official in Beijing. The Tong-il Group is headed
by Rev. Sun-Myung Moon, leader of the wealthy Unification Church of
South Korea.
   But American Panda has yet ``to tie up with anyone to provide
equipment to make cars,'' said the official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity. ``Nobody has signed on with them to provide marketing
rights or stamping equipment and so on.''
   Foreigners with some familiarity with the project question the
venture's ability to obtain parts in China as well as demand on the
world market for Chinese-made cars.
   Almost no Chinese can afford private automobiles and few can be
exported because cars made in China rely heavily on imported parts
and are not cost-competitive on the international market.
   The People's Daily said workers were busy with the first stage
of construction, an assembly factory, paint shop, administrative
building and parking lot.
   But ``no one's aware of any developments in Huizhou,'' said the
commercial official, noting that the company's plans largely are a
mystery. ``Any firm which pulls out a billion dollars and says
they're going to make 300,000 cars a year should at least come up
with some basic facts, but no one has been able to provide those
facts.''
   No foreign carmaker, including any from South Korea, has come
forward as any form of partner, the official said, though in
infrequent conversations with Panda representatives in Canton,
``they've mentioned just about every auto manufacturer.''
   Official Chinese reports in September said Huizhou planned to
borrow roughly $54 million to build power generating plants, docks
and other facilities needed for the factory.
   The project contradicts the Chinese government's attempts to
consolidate the slumping auto industry under central planners in
Beijing.
   Last year the State Council, China's Cabinet, announced it no
longer would approve auto manufacturing joint ventures and
cooperation and that passenger car production would be confined to
six major manufacturers.
   Those six are the First Automotive Works in the northern city of
Jilin, which makes Audis in cooperation with Volkswagen; the Second
Automotive Works in central Hubei province; the Japan-backed
Tianjin Automotive Industry Corp.; the Shanghai Volkswagen Auto
Co.; the Beijing Jeep Corp., a subsidiary of Chrysler Corp.; and
the Guangzhou (Canton) Peugeot Automobile Co.
   Chinese officials have said they hope to produce up to 600,000
passenger cars this year. China produced 33,000 passenger cars last
year and 39,000 in the first half of this year.
   The government's current austerity plan, which includes
forbidding most state-run institutions from purchasing cars, has
led to plunging sales and soaring inventories.

<HEAD>Inconclusive Oil Talks Could Mean Softer Gasoline Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices could dip slightly in
coming months if OPEC fails to cap its surging oil production,
analysts said Friday.
   U.S. pump prices could tumble 5 cents to 6 cents a gallon over
the next three months without restraint by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, said Allen Sinai, chief economist at
the New York investment firm of Boston Co.
   Mari Buglass, an oil analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in
London, predicted that retail gasoline prices would be ``likely to
stay static or (become) slightly softer for consumers.''
   Whether they go up or down hinges in part on the outcome of
negotiations among members of the 13-nation oil cartel, which
begins its winter conference on Saturday.
   The ministers started preliminary meetings on Thursday of the
committee that monitors world oil prices, then talked privately
Friday in their hotel rooms.
   ``We are trying to find a solution,'' said Saudia Arabia's
Hisham Nazer in early evening. ``We are making progress...There are
various options being considered.''
   OPEC Secretary-General Subroto described the ministers' work as
an ``information-seeking and solution-seeking exercise.''
   ``There are many things that are being explored right now,'' he
said.
   During their talks, the ministers must work out a new pricing
and production accord in line with world demand for OPEC oil,
forecasted to slow in the 1990 first quarter.
   They also must try to find a way to halt persistent quota
cheating by Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, each producing
about double their OPEC allotments of 1.1 million barrels a day to
press demands for higher shares.
   The extra production has raised the cartel's output above 23
million barrels a day _ sharply higher than OPEC's ceiling of 20.5
million barrels and well above the 21.7 million barrel average 1990
world demand forecast by the cartel's own economic experts.
   Despite the excess, prices have remained fairly steady due to
strong demand, particularly by developing countries.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was
$17.16 a barrel from January through the third week of October when
it reached $17.76.
   OPEC's target price is $18 a barrel. A year ago, the OPEC basket
registered $12.34.
   Futures prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
American crude which usually averages about $2 more than the OPEC
basket, have been in the $20-a-barrel range.
   Nevertheless, some cartel members see a need to curtail OPEC's
burgeoning production soon.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said late
Thursday that the cartel's production ceiling could increase but
``definitely not by more than one million'' barrels a day to 21.5
million barrels.
   Many analysts believe the ministers will bump up the official
production ceiling to that level in the first half of 1990,
divvying it up proportionately among all members, even though it
likely would not satisfy Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.
   Analysts said there was not enough pressure from weak prices to
force the ministers to come up with a novel solution or make tough
compromises in the quota dispute.
   ``What does it do to oil prices?'' asked Fergus MacLeod, oil
analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London. ``Not a lot. They
might fall some (but) very slightly.''
   Ginandjar said he wasn't worried about prices. ``I don't see any
reason why prices should collapse.''
   Ms. Buglass said, ``If they can be seen to reduce actual
production, the market will take heart.''
   But an inconclusive meeting, she said, could mean price erosion.
   A confusing outcome _ along with a sagging U.S. economy _ could
send oil prices down by about a dollar or two a barrel, Sinai said.
   But he added that he doubted the meeting would end on a false
note.
   ``OPEC has managed since November 1988 to control supply and the
perception of supply enough to keep prices up,'' he said.
   Every dollar change in the price of a barrel of oil amounts to
about a five-cent change in gasoline prices.
   U.S. gasoline prices shot up a seasonally adjusted 0.9 percent
in October, the biggest gain since a 3.9 percent upward jolt in May.
   Gasoline prices have been on a seesaw this year, going up by
21.2 percent in the first five months of the year and then falling
by 9.3 percent from June through September.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, resuming
the rally it began before the Thanksgiving holiday.
   Trading was light.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 17.49 on Wednesday,
climbed 20.91 points to 2,677.69 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.

long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose modestly, putting their yields in the
7.87 percent-7.97 percent range.
   The drop in rates came in the wake of signs Wednesday that the

aggressive lately in its efforts to cushion the impact of slowing
economic growth.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell Friday to its lowest level
against the West German mark since early January, and lost ground
against most other major currencies in trading in Europe. Gold
prices continued to climb.
   Foreign exchange dealers said investors expect an increase in
West German interest rates that would further strengthen the mark.
   Dealers expect the rally in the mark could last for some time.
It gained Friday against the strong Swiss franc and Japanese yen,
as well as the British pound and all the European Monetary System
currencies except the Belgian franc, which was steady.
   The dollar fell to 1.8040 West German marks in Europe, down from
1.8157 late Thursday and its lowest since it stood at 1.7955 marks
on Jan. 5.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 143.80 Japanese yen, down
from Wednesday's 143.88 yen. The market in Japan was closed
Thursday for a holiday. In London late Friday, the dollar traded at
143.57 yen.
   The dollar also fell against the British pound. In London, the
pound cost $1.5635 late Friday, up from $1.5610 late Thursday.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late
rates Thursday, included: 1.6145 Swiss francs, down from 1.6155;
6.1600 French francs, down from 6.1850; 2.0340 Dutch guilders, down
from 2.0405; 1,333.75 Italian lire, down from 1,336.50, and 1.1665
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1685.
   Gold prices rose to their highest level since late December in
what dealers said was lively activity.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $416.25 a troy ounce, up from
$411.50 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $416.10 an ounce
from $411.50 late Thursday.
   Earlier Friday, gold closed in Hong Kong at $414.05 an ounce, up
from $410.05.
   The late bid for silver bullion in London was $5.86 a troy
ounce, up from $5.82 late Thursday.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, depressed by weakness
in the soybean and soybean oil markets.
   Soybean oil prices have been slipping since the Malaysian
government announced on Nov. 14 that stocks of Malaysian palm oil
exceeded 1 million metric tons, an unexpectedly large amount.
   Palm oil and soybean oil are interchangeable in many processed
foods.
   The soybean market's decline defied the historical pattern of
higher prices on the day after Thanksgiving.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said the market's runup on Wednesday had been
based partly on expectations for a post-Thanksgiving rally, and
that few buyers were left on Friday.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 2{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in December at $4.07\ a bushel; corn was
{ cent to 2{ cents lower with December at $2.38 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to 1 cent higher with December at $1.46} a bushel;
soybeans were 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with January at $5.86} a

<TEXT>
   Thousands of bargain-starved shoppers stormed
staid B. Altman's on Friday, the first official day of the
venerable department store's going-out-of-business sale.
   ``It's like a war zone,'' said Audrey Lavine of Manhattan, who
battled the bedlam to purchase a designer suit on the second floor.
   ``It's a real mess downstairs _ a disaster,'' said Al Bellow of
Bayside, Queens, who plunked down next to a mannequin to await his
daughter.
   Drawn by the well-publicized clearance sale, officially
beginning on the traditional biggest shopping day of the year,
about 2,000 customers massed outside the flagship store on Fifth
Avenue and 34th Street before the doors opened at 10 a.m.
   Shoulder-to-shoulder crowds reminiscent of subway rush-hour
flooded the main floor. New waves were allowed in periodically.
   ``Perfume! I need Chanel!'' yelped one frenzied shopper, unfazed
by the cacophony.
   ``I'm flabbergasted at the number of people,'' said Charlie
Miller, director of housekeeping and maintenance, who provided
crowd-control and directed the onslaught on the second floor.
   The escalators were turned off from the main floor to the second
floor, but the line to walk up them was still about a quarter block
long.
   ``Look at this. No one is moving. The elevators are packed _
hundreds of people are lined up for them,'' said a Manhattan
resident who would not give her name.
   She was determined to walk to the eighth floor if necessary in
search of a baby blanket. ``I wouldn't think of buying a baby gift
anywhere else,'' she said.
   Throughout the store, cheery Christmas decorations were
interspersed with red and white signs that read: ``Everything Must
Go Regardless of Cost.''
   ``It's very sad for us _ especially when it's decorated for
Christmas,'' said Miller, a Jersey City, N.J., resident who has
worked at B. Altman's for 30 years. ``I think the store has never
looked better. We worked our hearts out _ we thought it would stay
open.''
   The 124-year-old chain is closing because its parent, the Hooker
Corp., could not find a buyer.
   ``Boy, am I going to miss this store,'' said Miller.
   ``I'm very, very sorry to see it closing _ it's one of the last
traditions in New York City,'' agreed Wendy Goidell of Manhattan,
who has shopped there about 20 years.
   ``It's kind of sad,'' said Ms. Lavine, who described Altman's as
``an institution _ a traditional, old-lady and wedding present kind
of store.''
   Others had no use for sentiment.
   ``Only 20 percent off regular prices. Not worth it!'' a fur-clad
woman loudly advised the crowd outside as she marched away.
   More shoppers _ many of them also disgruntled that prices
weren't lower _ packed B. Altman's in White Plains, which was
opened May 5, 1930, as the first suburban branch of a New York City
store anywhere in the nation.
   ``I think I can do better elsewhere,'' said Linda Putori of
Valhalla, who was there for the opening but left empty-handed.
``This is not what I consider a sale.''
   Gridlock gripped streets around the White Plains store. Some
motorists waited up to an hour to get into the parking lot; others
parked blocks away and braved icy sidewalks. Employees at
neighboring Neiman-Marcus struggled to get to work and find parking.
   One shopper, Vincent Buonanno of Tarrytown, stood in a long line
because his fiance wanted an omelette maker.
   ``This is a honey-do day,'' said Buonanno. ``Honey, do this;
honey, do that.''

<HEAD>Oil Futures End Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil futures prices ended mixed Friday in
relatively sparse trading, with most of the activity concentrated
in heating oil contracts.
   The December contract for No. 2 heating oil rose 0.32 cent to
61.41 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
January contract gained 0.35 cent to 60.87 cents a gallon, while
contracts through next June ended mixed.
   Wholesale unleaded gasoline for December delivery lost 0.10 cent
to finish at 51.63 cents a gallon, while the January contract lost
0.3 cent to 52.44 cents and the February through June contracts
gained between 0.77 cent and 0.30 cent a gallon.
   Trading in crude oil futures was light, with prices unchanged to
slightly higher.
   The January contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, remained at $19.82 a 42-gallon barrel, the
same as Wednesday. The market was closed Thursday for the
Thanksgiving holiday. Contracts for delivery between February and
June gained between 2 cents and 6 cents.
   Analysts said cold weather across much of the country helped
lift heating oil futures.
   Although market participants have turned their attention to the
weekend OPEC meeting, there was little advance news to move crude
prices in either direction, traders said.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is scheduled
to convene its winter conference Saturday in Vienna, Austria. The
13 ministers are expected to consider strategy for 1990, including
how much oil to produce to meet world demand without hurting prices.
   ``There is a lack of activity in crude oil because of no news
from OPEC,'' said Brendan Dolan, energy broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.

<DATELINE>FULLERTON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hughes Aircraft Co. has won a $325
million contract to remake Canada's air-traffic control system.
   Hughes was selected over International Business Machines Corp.
which won a similar but far bigger contest in the United States
last year.
   Company officials said they hope the contract, announced
Thursday, will open the doors to other foreign markets, including
Europe, which also is looking to modernize its air-traffic control
system.
   IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., won the modernization contract with
the Federal Aviation Administration by bidding $3.6 billion, $700
million less than Hughes' Fullerton-based Ground Systems Group.
   The worldwide market for air-traffic control equipment could be
as much as $20 billion over the next few years, Hughes officials
said.
   ``It's a whole new marketplace for us,'' said Dan Reeder, a
spokesman for the Ground Systems Group. ``It's reasonable to think
that we'll get a significant share of it.''
   Hughes Aircraft is a unit of General Motors Corp.

   Most bond prices finished slightly higher Friday
in thin trading in an abbreviated session, although corporate bonds
and some short-term government securities declined.
   The Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond edged up 1-16 point,
or about 62 cents for every $1,000 in face value. Its yield was
unchanged from late Wednesday at 7.87 percent.
   The market was closed Thursday for the Thanksgiving Day holiday,
and many traders also took Friday off. Friday's trading wound down
in the early afternoon, ending several hours before the usual close
of bond dealings.
   Analysts said bond prices initially were supported by positive
follow-through from Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve signaled it
was lowering interest rates.
   The central bank injected reserves into the financial system
Wednesday by making short-term purchases of securities from
dealers. Making funds available to the financial system takes
pressure off interest rates. Falling interest rates, in turn, boost
bond prices.
   But after the initial advance Friday, analysts said bond prices
lost some strength when the Fed unexpectedly reversed course and
drained some reserves from the system.
   That action was reflected in a rise in the federal funds rate,
the interest on overnight loans between banks, to 8\ percent from
8[ percent late Wednesday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury securities, prices of
short-term government issues were unchanged to 1-32 point lower,
intermediate maturities rose 1-32 point to [ point and long-term
issues were unchanged to 1-16 point higher, according to figures
provided by Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, edged up 0.26 to 1,197.87.
   In corporate trading, industrials declined. Moody's Investment
Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a
portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, fell 0.60 to 338.61.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 1-16 point to 937-16. The average yield
to maturity edged down to 7.26 percent from 7.27 percent late
Wednesday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 7.75
percent as the discount remained stable at 7.51 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 7.67 percent as the discount edged up 1
basis point to 7.30 percent. Yields on one-year bills increased to
7.58 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 7.08 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   The stock market pushed ahead in light trading
Friday, resuming the rally it began before the Thanksgiving holiday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.77 to
2,675.55, bringing its gain for the week to 22.89 points.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
931 up, 447 down and 522 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 86.29 million
shares, down from 145.73 million Wednesday and the lightest total
since 68.87 million were traded on July 3 _ another session
squeezed in between a weekend and a holiday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 103.11 million shares.
   Interest rates declined in the credit markets. Prices of
long-term government bonds, which move in the opposite direction
from interest rates, rose modestly, putting their yields in the
7.87 percent-7.97 percent range.
   The drop in rates came in the wake of signs Wednesday that the
Federal Reserve had taken another step to relax its credit policy.
   Analysts said it appeared that the Fed had become a little more
aggressive lately in its efforts to cushion the impact of slowing
economic growth.
   After two moves this month by the central bank toward easier
credit, expectations are running high on Wall Street that major
banks will soon reduce their prime lending rates.
   There is also conjecture that the Fed might underscore its
intentions by lowering the discount rate, the charge it sets on
loans to private financial institutions.
   Texas Instruments rose 1] to 37~ in active trading. The stock
rallied sharply this week after news surfaced that the company has
been awarded a patent in Japan for integrated circuits.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, up [
at 41{; Bristol-Myers Squibb, up \ at 56]; American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph, up \ at 43}, and McDonald's, up \ at 32~.
   Texas Air, traded on the American Stock Exchange, jumped 1[ to
13. Pilots and flight attendants ended their strikes against the
company's Eastern Airlines.
   Precious-metals stocks were mostly higher as the price of gold
extended its recent rally and hit its highest levels in nearly a
year at around $419 an ounce. Homestake Mining added 1[ to 19] and
ASA Ltd. 1 to 57[.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $17.53 billion, or
0.53 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 1.08 to 190.29.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 2.40 to 392.98, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.06 at 343.97.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
picked up 1.49 to 456.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the
market value index closed at 373.14, up 1.42.

<HEAD>Gold Hits New 1989 High Amid European Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices hit new highs for the year Friday as the resignation
of Czechoslovokia's communist rulers raised tension levels among
European investors over where Eastern Europe's political turmoil
will lead.
   On other commodity markets Friday, cattle and pork futures rose
sharply, grains and soybeans mostly were lower, and energy futures
were mixed.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold settled $7.60 to $8
higher with the contract for delivery in December at $419.30 a troy
ounce and the spot November contract at $418.90, the market's
highest close since last Dec. 13.
   Silver settled 7.2 cents to 7.7 cents higher with December at
$5.88 a troy ounce.
   Gold's advance, its fifth consecutive daily rise, largely was a
response to higher prices overnight in Europe, where investors are
growing increasingly uneasy over the rapid pace of political
changes in Eastern Europe.
   As one communist government after another bends to public
demands for reform, ``investors there feel they're on a political
bog and they're getting panicky,'' said Bruce Kaplan, president of
Kaplan &amp; Co., a precious-metals dealer in Santa Monica, Calif.
   European investors have become big buyers of gold, analysts
said, because they perceive the metal as a safe haven for assets
during troubled economic times.
   For most of the session, the New York gold market mirrored the
$4 to $6.50 gains made earlier in London. But prices spurted higher
late in the session following news that Communist Part chief Milos
Jakes and the rest of Czechoslovakia's communist leadership had
resigned following more than a week of huge protests.
   In the United States, the upheaval in Eastern Europe is widely
seen as sign of easing tensions between the East and West.
   But from a European standpoint, ``you don't know if you're going
to have a civil war or a revolution _ it's quite unstable,'' said
Craig Sloane, a metals analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp;
Co. ``You don't know from one day to the next which government is
going to resign.''
   Changes in Eastern Europe continued to support pork futures
prices Friday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   The U.S. government bought 280,000 pounds of pork bellies
Wednesday to ship to Poland as part of a food-aid package and a
recent Yugoslavian purchase 150,000 metric tons of bellies has
stirred hopes for more sales of U.S. pork to Eastern Europe.
   Stronger cash markets also boosted the pork markets and the
cattle futures markets.
   Live cattle settled .07 cent to .50 cent higher with the
contract for delivery in December at 76.07 cents a pound; feeder
cattle were .05 cent to .42 cent higher with November at 83.70
cents a pound; live hogs were .33 cent to .87 cent higher with
December at 51.12 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent
to 1.52 cents higher with February at 64.77 cents a pound.
   Grain and soybean futures ended mostly lower on the Chicago
Board of Trade, depressed by weakness in the soybean and soybean
oil markets.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 2{ cents lower with December at
$4.07\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents lower with December at
$2.38 a bushel; oats were unchanged to 1 cent higher with December
at $1.46} a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 4{ cents lower with
January at $5.86} a bushel.
   Energy futures prices finished mixed in relatively sparse
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with most of the
activity concentrated in heating oil contracts.
   Analysts said cold weather across much of the country helped
lift heating oil futures. Although market participants have turned
their attention to the weekend OPEC meeting in Vienna, there was
little advance news to move crude prices in either direction.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled unchanged to 11 cents
higher with January at $19.82 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent
lower to .35 cent higher with December at 61.41 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was .10 cent lower to .30 cent higher with
December at 51.63 cents a gallon.

   The dollar weakened against most major
currencies in quiet trading Friday, hitting a nearly 11-month low
against the West German mark here and abroad.
   Meanwhile, gold prices soared, continuing the momentum that
began before the Thanksgiving Day holiday on strong demand.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery closed at $418.90 a troy ounce, up $7.90 from Wednesday.
Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid for gold at
$412.90 an ounce, up $2.90.
   U.S. financial markets were closed Thursday in observance of
Thanksgiving.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's decline was largely due to
the mark's continuing strength.
   The dollar slipped to 1.8040 marks in Europe, down from 1.8157
late Thursday, and the lowest level since it stood at 1.7955 marks
on Jan. 5.
   In New York, the dollar traded at 1.8010 marks, down from
1.81275 marks late Wednesday. Louis Quilici, a dealer with Harris
Trust &amp; Co. in Chicago, said that was the lowest since early
January.
   The mark has risen on anticipation that West Germany might have
to raise interest rates to keep its economy from overheating. It is
widely believed that West German growth will accelerate as East
Germans continue to pour into the country following the recent
reforms in that country.
   Higher West German interest rates would raise returns on
mark-denominated investments and spur demand for marks.
   Meanwhile, concerns that U.S. interest rates would fall due to
weakness in the economy also helped depress the dollar, dealers
said.
   Trading was described as very quiet, with many dealers taking
the day off or leaving early to extend their Thanksgiving Day
holiday.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar closed at 143.80 Japanese yen, down from
Wednesday's 143.88 yen. The market in Japan was closed Thursday for
a holiday. The dollar traded at 143.57 yen in London, but rose to
143.60 yen in New York, up from 143.10 Wednesday.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound. Sterling bought
$1.5635, up from $1.5610 late Thursday. But in New York, the pound
traded at $1.5625, down from $1.5655 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
quotes, included: 1.6095 Swiss francs, down from 1.6110; 6.1415
French francs, down from 6.1835; 1,326.75 Italian lire, down from
1,337.00; and 1.16725 Canadian dollars, down from 1.16875.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday: 1.6145
Swiss francs, down from 1.6155; 6.1600 French francs, down from
6.1850; 2.0340 Dutch guilders, down from 2.0405; 1,333.75 Italian
lire, down from 1,336.50, and 1.1665 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1685.
   Gold prices rose in Europe to their highest level since late
December in what dealers described as lively activity.
   Gold closed in London at a bid of $416.25 an ounce, up from
$411.50 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to $416.10 an ounce
from $411.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold settled at $414.05 an ounce, up from
$410.05.
   Silver prices also rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery increased to $5.880 a troy ounce from $5.800
Wednesday. Silver settled at $5.86 an ounce in London, up from
$5.82 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Broadest Money Measures Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Nov. 13, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Friday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,193.4 billion from $3,190.1 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,045.9 billion from $4,038.7 billion.
   Meanwhile, the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell
to a seasonally adjusted $785.0 billion from $788.5 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.2 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.9 percent, within the Fed's
target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a
target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,165.1 billion, an 8.1
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,021.1 billion, up 3.5 percent, while M1
rose 4.8 percent to an average of $783.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported commercial and
industrial loans at the nation's major banks rose $2.09 billion,
compared with a decline of $2.45 billion a week earlier.
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $181 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$321 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $292.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Nov. 15, down from $293.1 billion two weeks earlier.

   Gold's move up and over $400 an ounce this past week was good
fortune for gold producers Down Under.
   The gold surge coincided with the Australian government's
heavily hyped U.S. launch of its redesigned 1-ounce gold and
platinum bullion coins.
   So perfectly did the events mesh that ``it's almost as if
someone is looking out for the Australians,'' said Bruce Kaplan,
president of Kaplan &amp; Co., a precious-metals dealer in Santa
Monica, Calif.
   Analysts consistently have cited investment demand as the main
factor behind gold's dramatic runup from less than $360 an ounce
since mid-September.
   The rally gained speed after the stock market's 190-point tumble
on Oct. 13 and shifted into high gear this past week, cracking the
psychologically important $400 level on Tuesday with surprising
ease.
   ``It kind of broke through $400 and never looked back,'' said
Fred Demler, metals economist with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in
New York.
   Gold for December delivery on New York's Commodity Exchange
settled at $419.30 a troy ounce Friday compared with $395.80 a week
earlier. Friday's price established a new high for the year.
   December silver rose to $5.88 a troy ounce from $5.685 on the
Commodity Exchange during the week while platinum for January
delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange climbed to $544.70 a
troy ounce from $526.60.
   Dealers say the rise in precious metal values has sparked a
substantial increase in sales of gold bullion coins such as the
U.S. Eagle, the Canadian Maple Leaf and the Australian Nugget.
   Representatives of GoldCorp Australia, a company formed by the
Australian government to market the Kangaroo Nugget and its
platinum counterpart, the Koala, were in the United States
promoting the newly redesigned coins when gold passed the $400
milestone.
   GoldCorp Chairman Donald Mackay-Coghill said that while he had
no sales figures, ``we have made very significant sales into the
market. I'm delighted with the sales we've made.''
   Market analysts say the increased investment demand for gold
indicates uneasiness among investors worldwide about the U.S.
economy and the political changes sweeping Eastern Europe. Gold
often is perceived as a safe investment haven during troubled
economic times.
   The news on Friday that Czechoslovakia's Communist leaders had
resigned appeared to lend new strength to the gold market.
   Gold prices have risen so sharply in the past six weeks that an
increasing number of analysts are predicting a sell-off in the near
future. But others say the market has potential to climb
considerably higher.
   Craig Sloane of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. said European
markets have been leading the rally and that when gold prices
falter overseas, the U.S. market will stall as well.
   William O'Neill, research director for Elders Futures Inc., said
he was keeping an eye on gold producers, who largely have been
absent from the market.
   ``One key factor that could halt the rally is if producers
decided the market has reached a level where they want to be
aggressive sellers,'' he said.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Offers to Buy Reff Inc. for About $98 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An affiliate of Westinghouse Electric Corp.
offered on Friday to buy all outstanding common shares of Reff
Inc., an office furniture manufacturer based in Toronto, Ontario.,
for about $98 million.
   Westinghouse, which is making the bid through Westinghouse
Canada Acquisition Corp., is offering 12.75 Canadian dollars for
each of Reff's 9.13 million shares. The Canadian dollar has been
trading at about about 85 cents in U.S. currency.
   The offer was scheduled to expire at midnight Dec. 21,
Westinghouse Electric officials said.
   If the offer is successful, Reff will operate as a unit of
Westinghouse Furniture Systems of Grand Rapids, Mich., Westinghouse
said.
   The acquisition would follow Westinghouse's recent purchase of
the Shaw-Walker Co., a manufacturer of metal desks and other
furniture.
   The four founders of Reff, who also are the firm's controlling
shareholders, have agreed to deposit and, except under certain
circumstances, not to withdraw an aggregate of 6 million shares
under the offer, representing about 66 percent of the outstanding
shares.
   The offer is conditional upon regulatory approvals and deposit
of no less than 83 percent of Reff's shares. It also is conditional
upon completion of Reff's sale of its 51-percent stake in
Hollanding Inc. to Hollanding's remaining shareholders.
   Reff has manufacturing plants in the Toronto area and sales
offices in Canada and the United States. It employs about 600
people.
   Westinghouse Canada Acquisition is a wholly owned subsidiary of
Westinghouse Canada Inc., an affiliate of Westinghouse Electric. It
was created to assist in the Reff transaction, said Reff spokesman
Mark Ingham.

   Animal rights activists held demonstrations around the nation on
Friday to protest fur sales on the opening day of the holiday
shopping season, hoping to shame shoppers into abandoning their
quest for fur garments.
   Game show host Bob Barker, the host of ``The Price is Right,''
led 2,500 activists down New York City's Fifth Avenue to tell
shoppers the price is always wrong when it comes to buying fur.
   It was Barker's second year leading the ``Fur-Free Friday''
protest, now in its fourth year.
   Demonstrators also marched in San Francisco, Miami, Harrisburg,
Pa., Corpus Christi, Texas, Durham, N.C., Syracuse, N.Y., New
Orleans and Seattle, and protests were scheduled in dozens of other
cities, according to Trans Species Unlimited, an animal rights
group. Four fur shops were vandalized in Miami and Fort Lauderdale,
Fla.
   In Harrisburg, where about 75 people marched, protesters filled
a black coffin with about $10,000 worth of mink, fox, and rabbit
furs. The furs were splashed with red paint to signify blood and a
nearby sign said, ``Fur is murder.''
   An organizer of the protest, the Rev. Marc Wessels of
Philadelphia, said the furs were donated by people who had
abandoned their fur-wearing ways and joined the animal rights
movement.
   About 50 people dressed in mourning black marched in San
Francisco's Union Square, in the heart of the downtown shopping
district.
   ``Fur is torture, don't buy fur,'' they chanted as a refrain,
picking their way through crowds of shoppers and gingerly trying to
keep from stepping on panhandlers sprawling on the sidewalks.
   In Durham, N.C., about 25 people picketed the South Square Mall,
toting signs that read ``Compassion is fashion. Don't buy fur.''
   In Miami, protesters wearing skin-colored leotards brought a
float to the downtown Bayside shopping mall. The message: ``I'd
rather be naked than wear fur.''
   It was hard to gauge the effect of the protests on business, but
most shop owners dismissed the protests as merely annoying.
   ``We have had very good sales at this time of year, as usual, so
I don't believe it has changed at all,'' said Christina Delgado,
manager of Rosina Malta Fashions in Miami, where the front door was
painted red by vandals.
   In Seattle, half a dozen fur store workers and mink farm owners
held a counterdemonstration with signs proclaiming the right to
wear fur next door to a shopping center protest by 35 animal rights
activists. Jeff Craggs, owner of Blue Granite Fur Farm, said
animals are used for food, medical research and circuses, so furs
shouldn't be singled out by protesters.
   In New York, standing behind Barker was Gary Kaskel of
Manhattan, who walked with his two pet fitch ferrets, which are
related to the mink and are often used for furs.
   ``It's a good image to let people see the animals alive,'' said
Kaskel, petting the animals. ``People don't see the animals in the
traps, so you have to let 'em see them alive, see how sweet they
are.''
   In front of Kaskel, five women dressed as skeletons marched
carrying a sign which said, ``Fur is Dead!'' Others in the crowd,
which stretched for four blocks, held signs reading ``Fake People
Wear Real Fur'' and ``Fur Belongs on Its Real Back.''
   Protester Nancy Winters, a Manhattan novelist, said she put away
all her furs _ including ``a sable you would die for'' _ after
rethinking the issue last year.
   There were few confrontations between the marchers and
fur-wearing shoppers. One woman in a fur coat was taunted with
chants of ``Shame!'' and ``Vanity!'' but she ignored the shouts.
There were no arrests.
   Barker, who resigned as host of the Miss USA pageant over its
award of a fur to the winner, criticized the nation's fur farms as
``animal concentration camps'' _ a charge which infuriated a
spokesman for the fur industry.
   ``That kind of spurious allegation is entirely without any basis
in fact,'' said Bob Buckler, executive director of the Fur Farm
Animal Welfare Coalition. ``The fact is animals raised on American
fur farms receive the highest standards of care of any farm animals
in the world.''
   Workers at Grove Cleaners and Furriers in Miami on Friday
arrived to find red and blue paint covering the front windows and
graffiti on a van parked out front in a fashionable section of
Coconut Grove.
   ``I don't think that's right. They have a right to express
themselves, but I don't think they should vandalize the store,''
said Alfonso Zequeira, who owns the shop.
   In addition to Ms. Delgado's nearby shop, two fur shops in Fort
Lauderdale also were vandalized.
   A spokeswoman for the Animals Rights Foundation of Florida,
Nanci Alexander, denied responsibility for the vandalism, blaming
it on furriers trying to make the protest groups look bad.

   Shoppers began their holiday buying wave, flocking to stores
across the country to start retailers' biggest selling season of
the year by bargain-hunting, browsing or seeking Santa Claus.
   Suburban malls and downtown shopping districts in many cities
and towns were jammed Friday with shoppers eager to locate video
games, electronic gear, costume jewelry, accessories, perfumes and
novelty gifts.
   Many merchants expanded their hours, anticipating a crush of
business on a day that traditionally is their busiest of the year.

   Eastern Airlines said there are no jobs for the
pilots and flight attendants who have ended their 8{-month-old
strikes, setting the stage for another legal battle for the
struggling carrier.
   With the holdout Machinists pledging Friday to continue their
strike, the main impact of the other unions' return to work
appeared to be more legal disputes between the company and unions.
   Meanwhile, a Machinists union leader said officials were working
out details of plans to step up their strike campaign to capitalize
on Eastern's precarious financial situation and what the union says
is a maintenance shortage.

   General Motors Corp. is reducing its share in
Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan by 2 percent to 38.2 percent in a stock
sale expected to net the U.S. automaker $82 million, GM said Friday.
   GM sold about 20 million shares of Isuzu to Japanese financial
institutions that already owned stock in Isuzu.
   GM spokesman John Pekarek said the decision to sell the shares
came because the company wanted ``to take advantage of our initial
investment.'' He said the sale was completed with a handful of
institutions at the same time it was announced.
   In 1971, GM acquired 34.2 percent of Isuzu and increased its
stake to 40.2 percent in 1982, the level of GM ownership prior to
the stock sale announced Friday.
   ``This sale does not detract from the strong commercial
relationship that has developed between the two organizations in
product manufacturing, development and marketing,'' said John F.
Smith Jr., a GM executive vice president.
   Isuzu now makes the Geo Storm subcompact car for GM. The car is
sold through the U.S. automaker's Chevrolet dealers.
   Isuzu and GM also are involved in about a half-dozen joint
ventures worldwide, Pekarek said. In the early 1970s, Isuzu made
the small Luv pickup truck and in the 80s made the Spectrum, the
Geo Storm's predecessor.
   Like the Storm, the Luv truck and the Spectrum were marketed
through Chevrolet dealers.

<HEAD>Cargill Tops 1989 Forbes List of Largest Private Companies</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Private Companies-List, 8 Takes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leveraged buyouts that have taken many companies
out of public hands slowed considerably in 1989, but the megabuyout
of RJR Nabisco Inc. catapulted the food and tobacco giant to the
No. 3 spot on Forbes magazine's list of 400 largest private
companies in America.
   Forbes said in its Dec. 11 issue that only 16 entries on the
list went private this year in leveraged buyouts, down from 49
companies last year.
   Forbes ranked the 400 largest private firms according to their
estimated or reported total sales during the most recent fiscal
year.
   Cargill, the international marketer of agricultural and bulk
commodities, topped the list for the fifth straight year.
   Minneapolis-based Cargill reported 1988 revenue of $43 billion,
up $5 billion from the previous year and more than double that of
the second largest company on the list, Koch Industries, the
Wichita, Kan.-based oil company with sales of $16 billion.
   Forbes estimated RJR Nabisco had sales of $14 billion last year,
ranking it third after the company was taken private by the New
York buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. The $30 billion
leveraged buyout was the biggest corporate takeover ever.
   A leveraged buyout is a corporate acquisition financed mainly
with borrowed funds that are repaid with cash from the target
company's cash flow or the sale of its assets. The technique has
raised concerns from some critics who believe such debt-burdened
companies are more likely to fail during an economic downturn,
leading to layoffs and other problems.
   Forbes defined a private company as one that has no publicly
traded stock. There are about 7 million private U.S. companies,
compared with roughly 10,000 firms that are public.
   There were 37 supermarket chains on the Forbes list, led by
fourth-ranked Safeway Stores of Oakland, Calif., which had revenue
of $13.6 billion. The list also had 14 real estate companies, 13
oil companies, 8 transportation companies and 7 restaurant and
fast-food companies.
   Among others on the list were retailers Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.,
ranked 16th with sales of $4.8 billion; Ralph Lauren's Polo Ralph
Lauren, which moved up 42 ranks to 105th place after increasing its
sales by $375 million to $1.3 billion, and L.L. Bean, the
Maine-based outdoor gear company, which ranked 298th with sales of
nearly $90 million.
   Other well-known companies included Donald Trump's Trump
Organization, the real estate, hotel and airline holding company,
which jumped from 217th place to the No. 99 spot after revenues
jumped from $700 million to $1.36 billion; Trans World Airlines,
No. 20 with sales of $4.4 billion; Estee Lauder Cos., 67th with
sales of $1.9 billion; Domino's Pizza, 79th with sales of $1.7
billion, and Perdue Farms, 130th with sales of $1.1 billion.
   There were 153 listed companies with actual or estimated sales
exceeding $1 billion, 14 more than the previous year.
   New York is the leading home town, claiming 45 of the largest
private companies, followed by Chicago with 24 and Dallas with 22
companies.

<HEAD>De Lorean Wins Court Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for former automaker John Z. De Lorean,
whose Belfast-based car company went bankrupt in 1982, won a High
Court order Friday setting aside an English court order against him
for more than $51 million.
   Judge Peter Gibson overturned a July 1987 court order that
allowed legal documents in the case to be served on De Lorean at
his home in New Jersey, outside the jurisdiction of the English
courts.
   ``It follows that all subsequent orders made against Mr. De
Lorean will fall away,'' Gibson said.
   The ruling was the latest stage in a dispute between the
liquidators of DSQ Property Co. Ltd., incorporated in Northern
Ireland and formerly called De Lorean Motor Cars Ltd., and De
Lorean.
   Unstated damages had been claimed against De Lorean for alleged
conspiracy, deceit and breach of fiduciary duty, Gibson said.
   In June 1988, the High Court entered judgment against De Lorean
ordering him to pay more than $51 million.
   Gibson said De Lorean took no part in the English proceedings
until this year, when DSQ sought to enforce the judgment in the
United States.
   On July 10, De Lorean issued a High Court summons seeking to set
aside the order allowing service in the United States, any service
of documents under that order and all subsequent orders made
against him.
   The application was opposed by DSQ, which went into receivership
in 1982 and had since been put into liquidation.
   Gibson ruled that in DSQ's application to serve documents on De
Lorean outside English jurisdiction there had been ``serious
non-disclosures'' of matters, including the existence of
proceedings against De Lorean in the United States unrelated to DSQ
and his likely defense.
   DSQ, which was ordered to pay De Lorean's legal costs, was
allowed to appeal Gibson's ruling, which was suspended pending the
appeal.
   De Lorean, a former General Motors Co. executive, set up his
plant in Belfast in 1978, employing more than 2,600 workers at its
peak.
   The British government, hoping to ease high unemployment in the
city, lost $140 million in the venture when the gull-wing sports
cars found few buyers.
   In 1982, De Lorean was arrested in Los Angeles on charges of
drug running but acquitted two years later of conspiring to
distribute $24 million worth of cocaine in the United States in a
bid to raise money for saving the failing car company.
