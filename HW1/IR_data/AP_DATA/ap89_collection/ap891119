   Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path movement
shot to death an army officer as he arrived at his home early
Sunday, police reported.
   They said Lt. Col. Simon Dulanto Navidad, 37, had driven to his
house in a Lima suburb when three gunmen approached, ordered him to
leave his car and then opened fire, hitting him five times in the
head, chest and arms.
   Police found Dulanto's revolver beside the body and said he
apparently had tried to defend himself.
   Dulanto was assigned to the army airtransport division in Lima.
   The Shining Path began its guerrilla campaign against the
government in 1980 and officials say since then more than 15,000
people been killed in violence related to the revolt.

   Lech Walesa drew cheers in this cradle of
American liberty on Sunday when he held aloft the city's Freedom
Award, which martial law had prevented him from getting in 1981,
and declared, ``We are free now.''
   In the morning, the Solidarity leader paused from his goodwill
tour of the United States to pray at the National Shrine of our
Lady of Czestochowa in suburban Doylestown, where he was joined by
an estimated crowd of 10,000 who shouted ``Welcome!'' in Polish.
   During the Mass said in Polish by Cardinal John Krol, retired
Archbishop of Philadelphia, Walesa was hailed as ``a great son of
Poland ... a man of unshakable faith and enduring courage.''
   Walesa spent the afternoon urging union members to support their
counterparts throughout the world. He also picked up the Freedom
Award and another honor, touched the Liberty Bell and ended his
Philadelphia visit with a private reception in Independence Hall.
   Walesa's stop in Philadelphia was the next to the last in this
country. He arrived in Washington a week ago and, after a stop in
New Jersey, was headed for Venezuela on Monday.
   Walesa flew in from Chicago on Saturday night. Chicago, said to
have the largest number of people of Polish descent of any city
except Warsaw, gave Walesa a rousing welcome including a rally that
attracted 20,000 people despite freezing temperatures.
   During his U.S. visit, he has also met with the president,
addressed a joint session of Congress and had numerous meetings
with business and industry leaders in his quest to find more
investors in the troubled Polish economy.
   The Nobel Peace Prize laureate ended his whirlwind tour Sunday
night with a visit to St. Hedwig's Roman Catholic Church in
Trenton, N.J., where he laid a wreath at a shrine for Father Jerzy
Popieluszko, the Polish activist priest who was murdered five years
ago.
   As Walesa entered the church, he was greeted by loud applause
and the singing of the Polish national anthem by about 1,500
Polish-Americans. Many of those gathered stood on pews and had
tears in their eyes.
   ``I am an example of the small person who can do great things,''
Walesa told the assembly. ``I am proof of the adage that faith can
move mountains. I believe in freedom and liberty and in democracy
and I didn't have an army.''
   Earlier Sunday in Philadelphia, Walesa said that he was putting
business aside for the day and instead urged listeners to ponder
the chain of events that brought a measure of democracy to his
country over the past year.
   ``Let us remember the road behind us,'' he said through an
interpreter at a ceremony after a breakfast in suburban Fort
Washington. ``Maybe we have to think over what we have done. Maybe
we have to remember.''
   He then rang a lifesize replica of the Liberty Bell, a symbol of
American freedom, three times to emphasize his words.
   The breakfast was sponsored by the Copernicus Society, a
Polish-American philanthropic group. One of the guests, Former U.S.
Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger, counseled Walesa on how
to build checks and balances into a new government.
   Burger told Walesa that he hoped Poles ``look to our experience
... that we divided the power'' among three equal branches of
government _ judicial, executive and legislative. ``That has been
what has preserved human liberty,'' he said.
   Also attending the gathering was author James Michener, who
lives in nearby New Hope. ``I cannot tell you how excited someone
like me is ... to see the collapse of a false idea that could rule
the people but not feed them,'' Michener said. ``That is a
revolution of a magnitude that staggers me.''
   A few miles away in Doylestown, the morning temperatures were in
the 20s. But thousands gathered on the sloping, sunlit meadow in
front of the shrine and cathedral hours before Walesa showed up for
the Mass.
   Walesa spoke after the service, starting from a prepared text
and then dropping his notes to ``speak from the heart.''
   ``We are building a proud Poland. We are building a faithful
Poland. We are building a Poland for all Poles,'' he said as the
crowd reacted with cheers to his unprepared remarks. Next to him
was folk singer Joan Baez, who sang a 1980 Solidarity strike song.
   After the Mass, Walesa traveled downtown to meet with about 100
area union leaders at the headquarters of the International Ladies
Garment Workers Union in Philadelphia. Walesa asked the audience to
join with him to protect the rights of working people everywhere.
   ``People in many regions of the world are in need of our common
support. Some people are even now jumping over the fence as I did
10 years ago,'' said Walesa, who first came to prominence when he
jumped over a fence to join striking Lenin shipyard workers in
Gdansk, Poland.
   From the union hall, he walked to the home of American
Revolution hero Thaddeus Kosciuszko, where he received the Freedom
Award, and then paraded with a string band to the Polish-American
Cultural Center.
   As he walked to the entry of the historic home, Walesa dove into
the crowd, shaking hands. To cheering and whistling, Walesa held
the medal aloft and spoke of his homeland in 1981, when he was
awarded the honor but unable to collect it because of martial law.
   ``It's clear that (eight years ago) I couldn't have carried this
medal of freedom to a country that isn't free,'' he said. ``We are
free now.''
   At the Liberty Bell, Walesa received a copy of the city's
Liberty Medal, a $100,000 award established this year to recognizes
leadership in the pursuit of liberty. The presentation was a
formality because Walesa's wife, Danuta, had accepted the medal
during a ceremony July 4th.
   As Hobart Cawood, director of the Independence National Historic
Park, explained how the bell rang to signal the Declaration of
Independence more than 200 years ago, Walesa studied the bell's
crack.
   ``Perhaps modern technology could stop this crack?'' he asked,
smiling. The crowd of invited dignitaries laughed.
   As hundreds of people outside chanted ``We want Lech!'' Walesa
turned and flashed two fingers in a ``V'' saying, ``This should be
the medal of Freedom and Liberty and Victory as well.''
   In New Jersey Sunday night, Walesa was a dinner guest at the
Princeton estate of Barbara Piasecka Johnson, the 52-year-old
Polish-born woman who inherited much of the Johnson &amp; Johnson
pharmaceutical fortune.
   Mrs. Johnson in June announced that she would spend up to $100
million for a 55 percent interest in the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk,
where the Solidarity movement was first kindled by Walesa in 1980.
The shipyard was scheduled to be shut down by Poland's Communist
government, who said it was unprofitable.

   Britain's tiny, hard-line Communist Party welcomed
the dramatic changes in Eastern Europe as delegates gathered
Saturday for the annual party congress.
   There are two communist parties here _ the hard-line Communist
Party of Britain and the Communist Party of Great Britain. The
Communist Party of Britain broke with the original party in 1987,
accusing it of revisionism.
   In 1987 the Communist Party of Great Britain gave up talk of
class war and declared it would follow a ``realist'' approach. It
claims 7,500 members.
   The Communist Party of Britain, which began its two-day session
congress Saturday, reports a membership of about 1,800.
   Delegates on Saturday praised Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's efforts to restructure the economy and East Germany's
Communist Party leadership for opening the Berlin Wall.
   Party chairman Derek Robinson told the 120 delegates, ``We are
living in a most exciting period of socialist developments in the
world.'' He said communism will provide the inspiration for further
changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   Robinson said that Britain, under 10 years of government by
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives, has seen rising
unemployment, an erosion of democracy and systematic attacks on the
union movement.
   Delegates arriving for the congress were greeted by a small
group of demonstrators whose spokesman said they believed in a
``reforged Communist Party,'' and neither the Communist Party of
Britain or the Communist Party of Great Britain was true to
communist ideals.

<HEAD>Elephant to Undergo Cesarian to Remove Dead Fetus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zoo veterinarians failed to remove a dead
300-pound fetus from an Asian elephant Saturday, and plan to
attempt a risky Caesarean section Monday to save the mother.
   Veterinarians fear Jean, the floppy-eared 19-year old mother,
could die a slow, painful death if the decomposing fetus is not
removed, said San Diego Wild Animal Park spokesman Tom Hanscom.
   But the Caesarean poses a high risk of infection, Hanscom said.
``We are extremely worried,'' he said.
   ``We wished to avoid a Caesarean because it is such a major
surgical operation,'' the spokesman said.
   Even if the operation is successful, the healing process could
take months, Hanscom said.
   Four veterinary surgeons will perform the three-hour procedure,
including Joe Forner, a veterinary surgeon from the Illinois Equine
Clinic. Jim Oosterhuis, the park's director of veterinary services,
will supervise the operation.
   Veterinarians confirmed Friday that Jean was carrying a dead
fetus. Hanscom said the baby died in September from fetal distress
after its legs were thrown forward and became wedged in the birth
canal during labor.
   Officials had believed the pachyderm's pregnancy to be a record
when it surpassed that of an Asian elephant that went 720 days
before giving birth at a German zoo. The average term of pregnancy
for such elephants is 618 to 668 days.
   Veterinarians attempted but failed Saturday to reposition the
fetus so they could pull and remove it, Hanscom said. At 300
pounds, the fetus was too large and too far into the birth canal
for veterinarians to move it successfully.
   Jean has responded to the procedures ``amazingly well,'' Hanscom
said.
   ``She has sat through four fairly stressful exams now,'' he
said. ``She came through it with flying colors and is up on her
feet. But she is showing signs of stress and has visibly lost
weight.''

<HEAD>Cheney Acknowledges Soviet Spending Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney now says there
is evidence the Soviet Union has cut military spending during 1989
in an assessment that comes after weeks of confusing and
conflicting statements on the issue by administration officials.
   ``It's clear that there are now signs in '89 that defense
spending may be turning down in connection with what was said
previously,'' Cheney said Saturday. ``But, again, you're talking
about intelligence reports, and you ahve to put together bits and
pieces of information before you draw final conclusions.''
   Having emphasized the inexact nature of assessing the Soviet
military budget, Cheney added on CNN's ``Evans &amp; Novak'' that
``it's fair to say that in fact there is evidence that the Soviets
are scaling down their conventional activities and their overall
level of defense spending.''
   On the same show, Cheney reiterated his long-held position that
the odds are against Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev being
able to transform the Soviet Union into a modern society.
   ``I remain of the opinion that the likelihood of that happening
is still remote, that the obstacles he has to deal with are, in
fact, enormous,'' said Cheney. ``I wish him the very best, but I
don't think we could base our policies on the assumption that he
will be successful.''
   Cheney's acknowledgement of Soviet military spending cuts came
through his spokesman late Friday, a day after House Armed Services
Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., accused the administration of
deliberately witholding intelligence information in order to
strengthen its case for Pentagon spending.
   ``We're not hiding anything,'' Cheney's spokesman Pete Williams
said when asked about Aspin's criticism.
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that Cheney had said in an
interview that the military threat from the Warsaw Pact has
diminished enough to begin planning to make ``significant''
reductions in U.S. military spending next year.
   ``While you need to be concerned about possible reversal of
trends in the Soviet Union, there's a real sense that you want to
take advantage of these developments,'' Cheney was quoted as saying.
   A senior Defense Department official Saturday night confirmed
that the Pentagon chief has ordered the armed services to draw up
plans for cutting $180 billion in projected spending during fiscal
years 1992-94. That would represent an average annual drop of about
5 percent in spending over the three-year period.
   It appears that the reason for the earlier confusion over Soviet
military spending was due to something that happens once in a while
in Washington _ reporters got information before senior
administration officials did.
   The brouhaha was touched off after The New York Times quoted
U.S. analysts as saying that they had indications the Soviets have
cut military spending this year, in line with promises made by
Gorbachev.
   Up until that time, administration officials _ including
President Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle, Secretary of State James
A. Baker III, Cheney and several of their aides _ pointed to
increases in Soviet spending of roughly 3 percent a year for the
past several years.
   ``The military spending, contrary to all these statements that
are going on, in the Soviet Union, over the last four years, has
increased. The United States has decreased its military spending,
not the Soviet Union,'' Quayle said in a television appearance on
Nov. 5.
   Bush, asked several days later if he agreed with Quayle, said,
``Yes. I'd like to see _ find a way to reverse that'' through
negotiations with Gorbachev.
   The publication ``Soviet Military Power: Prospects for Change,''
which was published by the administration in May, noted that
Gorbachev has announced he intends to reduce his defense budget by
14.2 percent over the next two years.
   However, it added that ``since 1985 Soviet defense expenditures
have increased by an average of 3 percent a year in real terms,
while U.S. defense spending has declined in real terms by over 11
percent during the same time period.''
   But after the Times report appeared this past week, confusion
grew.
   State Department spokesman Margaret Tutweiler was queried about
it, and she replied, ``It does appear that Soviet defense spending
this year is less than it was last year. We have seen evidence of
cuts in Soviet defense efforts.''
   Williams, asked the same question, declined on Tuesday to offer
an assessment, saying, ``I don't think we know precisely what '89
spending is going to be until 1989 is over.''
   Aspin, in a speech on Thursday, then accused the administration
of making statements that are ``outdated at best and absolutely
false at worst,'' and blocking the American people from getting
information that would allow them to make decisions about U.S.
defense spending priorities.
   President Bush ``should uncork the intelligence bottleneck'' and
``trust the American people to make the correct decision when given
correct information,'' Aspin said.
   Asked for Cheney's response to Aspin's remarks, Williams said
the secretary now says, ``There is some evidence the Soviets are
scaling down their conventional spending and their overall level of
defense spending.''
   Williams said confusion arose after information about Soviet
spending was given to some reporters by intelligence officials
before their organization relayed its updated information to senior
administration officials.
   The spokesman said that Cheney could offer no details about his
new assessment of Soviet military spending.
   ``It would be very useful if the Soviets would tell us what
their budget is, so we don't have to go through this exercise of
estimating it,'' Williams said. ``It's ironic that we're getting
beaten up about providing information that a closed society should
be providing to us.''
   Williams said he stands by his comments that a full picture of
the Soviet spending won't be available until U.S. analysts have a
chance to digest available information and the administration
releases its traditional estimate in the spring.
   ``This is still preliminary information. It's raw stuff. It just
popped out of the system before the system had a chance to analyze
it,'' the Pentagon spokesman said.

   District of Columbia police arrested 96 people
in front of the White House Saturday during a demonstration against
U.S. aid to the government of El Salvador, authorities said.
   Ninety-five of the demonstrators were carried away by police
when they sat in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the
White House, said police spokesman Sgt. Joseph Gentile. He said
they were charged with blocking a public space while one protester
was charged with assaulting a police officer.
   About 1,000 demonstrators took part in the rally, which was
sponsored by the Committee in Solidarity with the People of El
Salvador.
   A rally in Chicago resulted in the arrests of 36 people in front
of the Consulate of El Salvador, said police spokeswoman Patricia
Mooney. An estimated 20,000 people were attending a rally for
visiting Polish labor leader Lech Walesa when the arrests occurred.
The group was charged with mob action and resisting after police
carried the protesters to squad cars, Ms. Mooney said.
   The protesters marched from the State Department to the
Organization of American States and the White House. Most stood on
the street curb chanting ``The whole world is watching, the whole
world is watching,'' as some refused police orders to leave the
street and were hauled away in chartered buses.
   According to Gentile, the 95 who were charged with blocking the
street _ formally called ``incommoding'' _ were given the option of
paying a $50 fine or facing trial. Conviction at trial carried a
maximum penalty of 90 days in jail and the fine.
   The name of the person arrested on the assault charge was not
released and it could not be determined late Saturday if the person
was kept in jail.

   Buck Helm, the burly longshoreman who
survived 90 hours in the rubble of a freeway flattened in the Oct.
17 Bay area earthquake, died Saturday night, hospital officials
said.
   Perhaps the quake's most famous survivor, Helm, who turned 58 on
Nov. 10, died of respiratory failure at 7:30 p.m. PST at Kaiser
Permanente Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ronald Treleven.
He said attempts to resuscitate Helm were unsuccessful.
   Rescue workers were stunned to find Helm alive in his squashed
car in a 1\-mile collapsed section of Interstate 880, the
double-decked Nimitz Freeway, in Oakland four days after the
7.1-magnitude quake struck Northern California.
   His condition recently had improved slightly, Treleven said.
Helm had been taken off a kidney dialysis machine and doctors had
hoped they might soon be able to take him off a respirator that
enabled him to breathe.
   ``We were very surprised. We were very saddened,'' Treleven said.
   Helm's death brought the quake's overall death toll to 67 and
the Nimitz Freeway toll to 42. The quake injured more than 2,800
people, left more than 14,000 homeless and caused an estimated $7
billion in damage.
   The 5-foot-10, 220-pound Helm, whom local radio stations had
affectionately dubbed ``Lucky Buck,'' was pulled from the most
heavily damaged section of the collapsed freeway.
   Rescuers had given up hope of finding more survivors when an
engineer inspecting the structure's stability saw Helm wave from
inside his small car. A large beam that fell in front of Helm's
small car saved it from being flattened.
   Helm suffered a fractured skull, three broken ribs, nerve damage
to his leg and kidney problems due to dehydration.
   Helm was a longshoreman's clerk who worked the docks in Oakland
and commuted 250 miles on weekends to visit his family in
Weaverville. After his rescue, get-well messages were posted in
shop windows, outside the courthouse and on the marquee of a
theater in the tiny town.
   Helm's former wife, Lorrie Helm, said he seemed to understand
what had happened to him and was able to communicate with people
around him. She said he had acknowledged hearing the contents of
cards and letters from around the world that his family read to him.
   ``His love for us and our love for him is one of the major
things that kept him going,'' Mrs. Helm said at a news conference
three days after his rescue.
   Helm was unable to talk because of the respirator tube. ``We
talk with our eyes, with our hands, and the love we feel for each
other,'' Mrs. Helm said.
   Helm was transferred from Highland General Hospital to Kaiser
Permanente on Nov. 2 because he was a member of the Kaiser health
maintenance organization, his wife said at the time. Kaiser
initially said Helm was in serious but stable condition, but three
weeks ago his family told the hospital not to comment publicly on
his recovery.
   Telephone calls to Mrs. Helm's home and to the family's lawyer,
Bill Choulos, went unanswered Sunday morning.
   Helm's family has received dozens of movie offers for the story
of Helm's survival but Choulos said none was being seriously
considered. Choulos had hired a Beverly Hills public relations firm
to handle media and other inquiries.
   There was no immediate word of memorial services. Helm is
survived by his wife and at least four children.

   Boeing Co. and Machinists union leaders reached
tentative agreement early Sunday on a contract to end a 47-day-old
strike affecting more than 57,000 workers in nine states.
   Federal mediator Doug Hammond said he recommended terms that
eventually were accepted by both sides in a 14-hour bargaining
session that ended about 3:30 a.m. PST.
   Union leaders were divided on the offer, but the majority said
they would recommend approval.
   A ratification vote by members of the International Association
of Machinists and Aerospace Workers was set for Monday night.
   Terms of the three-year contract proposal were withheld pending
the vote.
   At Hammond's request, negotiators from the company and the union
returned to the bargaining table Saturday, the third such attempt
to find agreement since the strike began Oct. 4.
   The walkout is the longest for Seattle-based Boeing since 1948.
   Chief Boeing negotiator Larry McKean said strikers could be back
on the job as early as Wednesday morning, adding that he was
``certainly elated to have a tentative agreement here.''
   Tom Baker, president of Machinists District Lodge 751 in
Seattle, which represents nearly four-fifths of the workers covered
by the union, and Justin Ostro, an international vice president who
coordinates aerospace industry negotiations for the union, took
opposite positions on the contract.
   Ostro said it failed to increase wage rates beyond what Boeing
had proposed since Oct. 2, two days before the strike began,
although it did boost production bonuses. But Baker called the
settlement ``a substantial improvement'' over previous Boeing
offers.
   Ostro said the recommendation to accept came on a 3-2 vote of
the union bargaining team, on which he does not vote. Both sides
will argue their cases before members cast their ballots on
ratification, he added.
   Baker said ratification was favored by negotiating team members
representing 55,000 of those covered by the union.
   Hammond said his decision to submit his own recommendation to
the two sides for settlement was ``an unusual and for me a rare
step'' that he has used only once before in his 15 years with the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
   Boeing's previous offer included wage increases of 4 percent the
first year, then 3 percent each of the other two years; annual
bonuses of 10 percent of gross pay the first year, then 4 percent
the other two years; a reduction in mandatory overtime; and
across-the-board increases in retirement benefits.
   The strike caused airlines, in the midst of industrywide and
highly competitive expansion, to have trouble getting planes they
have ordered. Boeing has delivered 22 planes since the strike
began, though it had hoped to deliver 94 in the last three months
of 1989.
   At least six of Boeing's major customers last week reported
delays in receiving new planes, and some said they had to alter
plans for expanding or inaugurating service.
   Boeing spokesman Paul Binder would not comment last week on the
delays. He said only that production work was being done by
supervisors and any machinists who have crossed picket lines.
   Boeing estimated 5.5 percent of Seattle-area machinists and 40
percent of those at its Wichita, Kan., plant have gone back to
work. Union estimates were much lower.
   Machinists represent more than 57,000 Boeing workers, including
about 43,000 in the Seattle area, 12,000 in Wichita, 1,700 in
Portland, Ore., and a few hundred at sites in a half-dozen other
states.
   Boeing's longest strike was 140 days in 1948 by machinists. A
1977 machinists' strike lasted 45 days.

   One of the last ramparts of Communist
control fell over the weekend with the first broadcast of a
prime-time news program controlled by the Solidarity-led government.
   ``The news will be good and bad. Let's hope the latter will be
few, but it will always be true,'' news announcer Wojciech
Reszczynski declared during the Saturday broadcast of the evening
news.
   The lead story was a report on President Wojciech Jaruzelski's
meeting with relatives of officers killed at Katyn in the Soviet
Union during World War II.
   Two years ago, any discussion of the deaths of the 4,300
officers was taboo. Polish and Western historians blame the Soviets
for the killings, while Moscow says the Nazis were responsible.
   The evening news even visited the censor, who is less active
under the new government. But the censorship officials were not in
their office, and the porter refused to let the news crew into the
building.
   The Communist Party had dominated the mass media ever since
World War II, and the evening news had been one of its main
instruments of propaganda. The old news and its announcers were
despised by many Poles, especially since all male announcers wore
uniforms during martial law imposed in 1981.
   Solidarity was crushed at that time and not legalized again
until this year.
   Poles had expected change in the evening news ever since the
Solidarity-led government was elected two months ago, but the new
Cabinet approached reform of television with great caution.
   The first visible change Saturday was in the graphics
introducing the show. They included the ``V'' for victory sign
associated with the Solidarity labor movement since it was founded
nine years ago.
   The news presented a report on the financial situation of the
Gdansk shipyard, the birthplace of Solidarity, followed by a long
piece on Solidarity union leader Lech Walesa's trip through the
United States.
   The revamped evening news is the work of a group of people fired
during the martial law crackdown and reinstated by Andrzej Drawicz,
the new head of the powerful Radio and Television Committee.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the only non-Communist leader
in the East bloc who took office Aug. 24, appointed Drawicz to head
the committee in September.
   The veteran Solidarity activist immediately appealed to former
radio and television employees who had lost their jobs for
political reasons to resume work. Hundreds answered his call.
   Drawicz said employees of the old committee would not be
dismissed but that they would no longer appear on the air.
   Some viewers were delighted to see the face of Bohdan
Tomaszewski, a favorite sports commentator who refused to appear on
television after martial law. He later worked for underground Radio
Solidarity.
   A hotline was set up for viewers to phone in their impressions.
   The news later reported that the phones had been ringing
constantly and generally people liked the changes. It said there
were only two calls demanding a return to the old news.

<HEAD>Malaysia's Leader, Reversing Course, Says Nation's Birthrate Too
High</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KENNETH L. WHITING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five years after urging Malaysians
to have more babies, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad says the
country's high birthrate now endangers its standard of living.
   Malaysia, with a population of 17 million, must reduce its
birthrate or the government could be overwhelmed by economic
demands from a burgeoning population, Mahathir said.
   His remarks were made Friday at the opening of a United Malay
National Organization meeting. The group is the dominant political
party in the governing National Front coalition.
   Based on 1985 statistics, Mahathir said the population was
increasing by 340,000 a year, or more than a million every three
years.
   The current birthrate of 2 percent to 3 percent could require
heavy government spending, the creation of many more jobs and lead
to a decline in living standards in the not too distant future.
   Mahathir's comments indicated the official policy of encouraging
a baby boom would be reversed, but official sources could not
confirm this Sunday.
   He suggested in 1982 that Malaysia create its own market for
manufactured goods by increasing its population of 14 million at
that time by 400 percent, to 70 million people. Mahathir said he
would like to see his country emulate Japan _ a high-density nation
with a domestic market capable of sustaining its economy.
   His advocacy of rapid population growth, which became national
policy in 1984, have stirred controversy.
   The World Bank and other international agencies said Malaysia
should limit population growth to spur economic expansion and
improve living conditions.
   The government de-emphasized family planning programs and
enacted laws encouraging larger families. Maternity leave and other
benefits were extended for working mothers up to their fifth child.
   Mahathir, himself the father of five, said at the time: ``I'm
not saying we'll achieve (the target) overnight, but this is the
first step.''
   It proved to be a giant step. The original population goal was
70 million by the year 2100. Mahathir said Friday that, with the
present rate of growth, there could be that many in 2030, or 70
years earlier.
   Nevertheless, Malaysia is still one of the least densely
populated countries in southeast Asia. It is also one of the
world's biggest producers of rubber, tin, palm oil and pepper and
is rich with crude oil, natural gas, cocoa, coconuts and other
products.

<HEAD>Third Ex-Policeman Reportedly Admits Role in Death Squad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A third former policeman has
confessed to involvement in a police death squad that assassinated
government opponents, a newspaper reported Sunday.
   The Sunday Times, South Africa's largest-circulation newspaper,
identified the third man as David Tshikalange and said he has fled
the country after telling a journalist he was a member of a death
squad reportedly headed by former police Capt. Dirk Coetzee.
   Coetzee, who also has fled South Africa, said in a newspaper
interview published Friday that he commanded a death squad and
arranged political assassinations with the approval of senior
police commanders.
   Coetzee gave the interview after being implicated last month in
an affidavit by a former policeman, Butana Nofomela.
   Nofomela was spared from Death Row _ where he faced hanging for
a non-political murder _ after giving information about the
unsolved killings of several activists. He said he participated in
a death squad that was commanded by Coetzee, who is white, and
which included Tshikalange, a black.
   The allegations are under investigation, but police officials
have denied the existence of any death sqaud and described Coetzee
as an unstable, embittered man who had faced disciplinary action.
   This attempt to discredit Coetzee, even before his charges are
investigated, has been depicted by anti-apartheid groups as part of
a broader cover-up effort.
   Lawyers for Human Rights, the organization that obtained
Nofomela's affidavit, is now seeking assurances from the Justice
Ministry that the prisoner will not be executed until all the death
squad allegations are resolved.
   Coetzee reportedly has fled to London, but his wife, Karin
Coetzee, said in interviews published Sunday that he confided in
her before he left.
   ``Every word is true,'' she told the Sunday Star. ``My husband
told me he needed to clear his name and he wanted to tell the whole
world. He said he wanted to be able to live with himself and to
have a good conscience.''
   She said he decided a week ago to flee South Africa for fear he
would be killed or made a scapegoat for killings authorized by his
superiors.
   One of the activists allegedly killed by the death squad was
Griffiths Mxenge, a black human rights lawyer.
   Bhgeke Shezi, who was Mxenge's law partner, said the official
investigation of the allegations appeared inadequate.
   ``Although Coetzee was named by Nofomela as head of the hit
squad, the investigators did not interview him before his sudden
departure,'' Shezi said. ``There are many other relevant people who
have been ignored.''
   Opposition leaders said Coetzee's allegations substantiated
their longstanding suspicions that police were behind dozens of
unsolved killings of activists.
   Coetzee said death squads were formed in 1980 and based at a
farm near Pretoria, where former guerrillas were housed after their
capture and placed in a counterterrorist unit. He corroborated
Nofomela's story that a police unit killed Mxenge, mutilating his
body and trying to make it look like a robbery.

   Two men who may have escaped from
a prison in Austria shot and killed four men in a German bar,
kidnapped a woman, and led police on a chase that ended in a
shootout that left one of the gunmen dead.
   The crime spree began Saturday when the two gunmen killed four
men at a bar in the Bavarian town of Laaber and wounded two others
after demanding money from them, said police Sunday.
   Police said the gunmen, believed to be convicted robbers who
escaped from an Austrian prison, fled in a car that had been stolen
in Austria.
   In the 185-mile chase that followed, the gunmen escaped from a
garage where police had cornered them and kidnapped a 26-year-old
woman from her home near Neumarkt, Bavaria, escaping in her car,
police said.
   Hans Kuffer, spokesman for Hesse state police, said police
finally caught up with the assailants late Saturday south of
Frankfurt.
   One of the gunmen died in a resulting shootout with Bavarian and
Hesse state police, and the other was wounded, Kuffer said.
   He said the woman hostage was not hurt.

   Nigeria, which has not conducted a
nationwide census since 1960, will count its burgeoning population
in 1991, a report said Sunday.
   The census will determine whether Africa's most populous nation
has grown to 100 million people, as estimates say, and whether it
is likely to become the world's third most populous country by the
middle of the next century, as some predict.
   The census will be politically sensitive because regional and
ethnic groups reportedly inflate their numbers to gain power in the
national government.
   Shehu Musa, the chairman of the National Population Commission,
said the census will be conducted in October 1991, the News Agency
of Nigeria reported.
   Musa said a trial census will be conducted in November 1990 to
assess the commission's ability to make a fair count. The country
will be divided into 10,000 areas for the purposes of the counting.

   Thousands of flag-waving Spaniards
demonstrated in downtown Madrid on Sunday to commemorate the 14th
anniversary of the death of Gen. Francisco Franco.
   The rally, led by Franco's only daughter, Carmen Franco Polo,
was organized by veterans who fought with Franco during the 1936-39
Spanish Civil War.
   Organizers estimated the crowd at 25,000, but police said 5,000
attended. The peaceful demonstration lasted about 90 minutes.
   The demonstrators gave the fascist salute and shouted ``Franco,
Franco, Franco'' and ``Long live Franco.''
   After Franco's forces won the Civil War, he established an
authoritarian regime that ended with his death at age 83 on Nov.
20, 1975.
   Demonstrators placed bouquets of flowers on an equestrian statue
of Franco that stands in front of the Transportation Ministry.

<HEAD>China Expresses `Indignation' Over Congressional Sanctions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China on Sunday expressed its ``utmost
indignation'' over wide-ranging U.S. sanctions against China for
its crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators last spring.
   Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu lodged a strongly worded
protest with U.S. Ambassador James Lilley over the bill, which
Congress has sent to President Bush for signing, a U.S. diplomat
said.
   Liu, who is responsible for North American affairs, told Lilley
that China regards the bill as interference in its internal affairs
``and hopes the U.S. government will take action to stop it,'' said
the diplomat, who declined to be further identified.
   The bill was drafted to protest the Chinese army's violent
attack on the unarmed protesters June 3-4. It crushed a movement
that had demanded democratic, educational and other social reforms.
   The Chinese government called the demonstrations
``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' instigated with help from
overseas. It said they sought to overthrow China's Communist regime.
   ``Since the Chinese government put down the counterrevolutionary
rebellion ... in accordance with the Chinese constitution and laws,
the U.S. Congress has meddled in China's internal affairs and
stirred up an anti-China wave by adopting one resolution after
another on this matter which is purely the internal affairs of
China,'' Liu was quoted as saying by state-run television and the
Xinhua News Agency.
   ``The U.S. Congress still goes ahead with the adoption of a
resolution against China, basing itself on false reports and
rumors, and thus gravely damaging the Sino-U.S. relations and
hurting the national feelings of the Chinese people,'' Liu was
quoted as saying.
   The bill, which Bush could veto, imposes two years of trade
sanctions including suspension of trade assistance, halts risk
insurance for American firms doing business in China, and freezes
exports of satellites, controlled munitions such as helicopters and
certain nuclear material and components.
   The bill condemns what it calls the ``unprovoked, brutal and
indiscriminate assault'' on the protesters and unarmed civilians,
which it said left 700 dead.
   China has said some 300 people died, but western intelligence
estimates put the number as high as 3,000.
   In Dhaka, Bangladesh, Chinese Premier Li Peng said Sunday that
Western trade sanctions against China because of its crackdown on
dissent would backfire and hurt the countries imposing the
restrictions.
   ``These sanctions are causing considerable strains on the
development process,'' Li said. ``Western investment is not only
beneficial to China but also to those who have invested.''

   Mathias Rothe, a teacher, says he
is among progressive Communist academics who long called for the
reform forced on his discredited party by a popular revolt.
   But many non-Communists in this rundown southern industrial
city, the country's second-largest where some of the first massive
protests began in October, are skeptical the party is genuinely
willing to revamp the political system.
   Rothe, 42, a party member since 1965 who taught ``basic
Marxism-Leninism'' to music students at Leipzig Conservatory, says
that to him and his progressive colleagues, ``It's satisfying for
us that what we indicated should happen for years is now taking
place.''
   No musician, however great a virtuoso, could graduate without
the course that has now disappeared as a requirement since the
revolt prompted sweeping changes in every area of East German life.
Rothe now teaches general political economy.
   At the conservatory and in other Leipzig institutes, the
students have voted to disband the Communist youth movement, Free
German Youth, in favor of genuinely democratic student councils.
   New Forum, East Germany's largest opposition group, condemned by
the Communists just a month ago, ``is making the kind of demands
which should have come from us,'' Rothe said in an interview in his
office.
   ``And internally, they did come. But not from the party as a
whole.''
   During an hour-long conversation, a visibly nervous Rothe cited
several incidents when he spoke his mind only to find some comrades
supported him and people at the top did not.
   In other East European countries, such divided opinions within
the party became evident in the government-run media or in the
public speeches of various Communist leaders.
   In East Germany, home of Prussian order, ``a Stalinist
interpretation of party discipline'' kept differences behind closed
doors, Rothe said.
   The government's refusal for years to institute Soviet-style
reform ``was a disaster, a catastrophe,'' he said.
   Like many other Communists he has no thought of quitting the
party that has given him power and a creed, but he is bitter about
the past.
   ``I don't know if one should put Erich Honecker, a man who is
nearly 80, on trial, although his guilt is immeasurable,'' Rothe
said of the former party leader, who was ousted Oct. 18.
   ``But Guether Mittag belongs in court without question,'' he
said, referring to the former Politburo member who was responsible
for the economy.
   In the eyes of non-party members, any of the approximately 2
million Communists can be held to account for the woeful state of
the economy, the bureaucratic meddling and regimentation of every
aspect of daily life in the past.
   The new leadership under Egon Krenz, who replaced Honecker as
president and party chief, has promised reform, eased foreign
travel restrictions and punched holes in the Berlin Wall.
   But skeptical demonstrators chanting ``opportunist,
opportunist'' have prevented any Communist officials, however
reformist, from addressing the weekly pro-democracy demonstrations
in Leipzig, a city of 550,000.
   ``I turn around to a man who was booing behind me and try to
explain that there are also good people in the party,'' Rothe said.
``But the mood of the masses is against the party at the moment,
which makes it inevitable that the first reaction is a chorus of
whistles.''
   Rothe and other Communists see hope in the reforms and say they
are genuinely prepared to stand in free elections.
   Much of the population and even some Communists appear
unconvinced.
   According to Politburo member Guenther Schabowski, 66,000
comrades have handed in their party cards this year and
resignations continue.
   Kai Hannig, 23, a New Forum organizer at Leipzig brewery, says
workers are also quitting the official trade unions. As in the
institutes, factory branches of the Free German Youth are being
dissolved, while New Forum has built up groups in at least 25 city
factories in just four weeks.
   The Communist Party remains, of course, an immensely powerful
body with resources far beyond those of any group in East Germany.
   But, as Falk Hocquel, another New Forum activist, noted, ``None
of the minor party officials has a tape recorder or access to a
computer to organize at the grassroots level as we are beginning to
do.''
   Hocquel recently attended a conservatory discussion, sharing the
platform with Rothe and others.
   ``The devil lies in the details,'' he recalled of Rothe's
contribution. ``It all sounds fine in general, but when you get
down to precise questions like the Communist Party's claim to
power, there's no basic change.''

<HEAD>Former Justice Department Official Now Represents Colombian Drug
Lords</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors regularly leave government service
to defend the kind of people they once tried to put in jail, but
some say the case of Michael Abbell is special.
   Abbell left the Justice Department in 1984 after 17{ years _
during which he rose to head the Criminal Division office that
handled extraditions from foreign countries. Now, he represents
some of the very people the United States wants most to extradite:
alleged cocaine kingpins from Colombia.
   He also has urged Congress to amend mutual legal assistance
treaties with foreign nations to give defendants in international
cases the same rights as prosecutors in obtaining evidence from
overseas, and he helped craft a policy resolution on that issue
that was approved in August by the American Bar Association.
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chairman of the Senate narcotics and
terrorism subcommittee, criticizes Abbell's switch to the other
side.
   ``I personally find quite troubling the decision of a former
high-level Justice Department official like Mr. Abbell to provide
expertise to major cocaine traffickers that he gained while he was
working for the United States Justice Department and privy to the
innermost workings of our criminal justice system,'' Kerry wrote
recently to the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.
   But Abbell contends _ and legal ethics experts agree _ that
prosecutors switch sides all the time and there is nothing wrong
with it.
   ``I obtained written conflict-of-interest clearance from the
Department of Justice, even though it was not necessary, in an
excess of caution,'' he said. He obtained that clearance prior to
appearing in a Spanish court in 1985 as an expert witness on U.S.
grand jury practices in a case involving alleged Cali cocaine
cartel kingpin Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and alleged Medellin
cocaine cartel leader Jorge Ochoa.
   Department spokesman Dan Eramian confirmed that Abbell received
conflict-of-interest clearance.
   More recently, Abbell said, he has traveled several times to
Cali to meet with Rodriguez and his associates to advise them on
how to avoid U.S. extradition requests. Rodriguez and other alleged
Cali cartel leaders are on a Justice Department list of 12 ``most
wanted'' drug fugitives.
   Abbell, interviewed by telephone, acknowledged that the
extradition treaty with Colombia ``was negotiated when I headed the
(Justice Department) office,'' but he stressed he's not scrounging
for a loophole in his representation of Colombian clients. He said
he is arguing ``that treaty was held to be not enforceable by the
Colombian Supreme Court because it was not properly ratified in
Colombia.''
   The treaty was reinstated under emergency measures Aug. 18 by
President Virgilio Barco.
   Abbell said he left his law firm after a Washington Post story
last month about his new clientele, but added, ``These people are
by no means my only clients. A good part of the work I do is in the
white collar area.''
   Abbell said he left the Justice Department because of the
relatively low pay and because a political appointee was ``moved
down on my shoulders.''
   ``Very few prosecutors stay on for their whole lives and most of
them get involved in defending cases,'' he said. ``... You go to
any district in which there are drug defendants and you will find
former prosecutors defending them.''
   ABA officials scrutinized Abbell's work on the ABA resolution in
the wake of the publicity about his clients, said James R.
Silkenat, who chairs the association's International Law Section.
   Silkenat said he found Abbell ``did not initiate the action,''
the people involved knew of Abbell's clientele, and his work was
``well apart from any private work he might have been doing. ...
There didn't seem to be any particularly pernicious acts by him
that anybody could complain about.''
   Stephen Gillers, New York University legal ethics professor,
said he found no legal or ethical problems with Abbell's
side-switching. Since Abbell developed the extradition treaty with
Colombia, he cannot argue the treaty is unconstitutional under U.S.
law but arguing that the Colombian Supreme Court's action makes it
inoperable is ``absolutely valid,'' Gillers said.

   Samuel Skinner, transportation secretary by
trade, is getting a reputation as the Bush administration's
``master of disaster,'' the Mr. Fix-It for domestic crises.
   When San Francisco was jolted by a major earthquake Oct. 17,
President Bush immediately assigned his transportation secretary to
coordinate federal relief efforts.
   It was not the first time Bush turned to his transportation
secretary in a time of crisis. Skinner is Bush's point man for
dealing with the environmental devastation from the Exxon Valdez
oil spill off the coast of Alaska and the continuing strike by
Eastern Airlines pilots. He was the first high federal official to
survey the damage from Hurricane Hugo.
   While there is a transportation thread in each of these issues,
Bush has expanded Skinner's role to areas covered by other Cabinet
secretaries or agency heads.
   Skinner was in San Francisco again last week, walking the
damaged Bay Bridge. Before that, he surveyed Charleston, S.C.,
checking damage from Hurricane Hugo. He also is planning another
trip to the Alaska oil spill site.
   ``Sam has more or less assumed the role of a domestic crisis
management team, without portfolio,'' said GOP consultant Peter
Teeley, equating Skinner's role with one he said Bush played on
foreign policy matters in the Reagan administration.
   ``He's the one person Bush continues to look to when these
things arise,'' Teeley said.
   Skinner's staff has nicknamed him the ``master of disaster,''
erecting a small mock shrine with plants, candles and his
photograph while he was on his first trip to California after the
Loma Prieta quake.
   The raspy-voiced former Chicago prosecutor and mass transit
administrator has a less lofty definition of his role in such
crises as the earthquake.
   ``I'm available to cut through any paperwork, bureaucracy and
red tape if necessary,'' he said in an interview.
   Skinner, a 51-year-old certified pilot, has not escaped
criticism in his role as secretary of a department with 102,000
employees and a nearly $25 billion budget to oversee airways,
waterways, highways, railroads, and pipelines.
   He first stepped into controversy when he announced the
administration's refusal to intervene in the strike against Eastern
Airlines. Labor unions accused him and Bush of playing into the
hands of Texas Air Corp. owner Frank Lorenzo, whom they accuse of
trying to bust the union and sell off the airline.
   Skinner forced alterations in the stock buyout of Northwest
Airlines, a move that analysts say was partly to blame for the
collapse of plans by United Airlines employees and management to
take over parent company UAL Inc.
   The collapse of the UAL deal, in turn, is widely blamed for
triggering the Oct. 13 sharp drop in the stock market.
   ``He probably has primary responsibility for failure of the UAL
deal,'' said transportation expert James Gattuso of the Heritage
Foundation, a conservative think tank.
   Skinner disclaimed any role in the stock market decline, saying
the United deal failed ``for one reason and one reason only _ it
was not sound financially.''
   The March 24 Exxon Valdez spill of 10 million gallons of crude
oil into Alaska's Prince William Sound put Skinner at odds with
some environmentalists who claim the company's cleanup has been
inadequate.
   Skinner said he is satisfied with Exxon's effort, which has cost
the company hundreds of millions of dollars.
   His department also has been the focus of controversy and court
tests over mandatory random drug testing of employees in
safety-related jobs. The new rules go into effect next month.
   Skinner also has announced he is considering expanding the rules
to check for alcohol abuse in air, sea and rail transportation
industries.
   ``I don't want to mislead that I'm some kind of prude,'' Skinner
said. ``I occasionally have a drink ... but alcoholism is a major
problem in this country.''
   In dealing with air terrorism, Skinner has expanded his role to
that of a diplomat, traveling to Canada and Europe for meetings
with other transport officials after the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am
Flight 103 over Scotland that killed 270 people.
   The Air Transport Association, representing airlines, said
Skinner moved too quickly in ordering them to pay for and install
anti-terrorist devices that might not do the job.
   But association president Robert J. Aaronson praises Skinner for
his openness.
   ``I don't think there's ever been a secretary who was more
available for a meeting with a senior person from the industry,''
he said.
   With all the issues Skinner has handled in 10 months, he puts
one as his highest priority: plans to set a national transportation
policy after a series of nationwide public meetings.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., who ran Transportation in the Carter
administration, said this is not a new approach.
   ``Every transportation secretary has tried it, and it always
ends with the staff writing up huge volumes of material and you
always come out in the same place,'' Adams said.
   Skinner sees it differently.
   ``I don't think anybody has looked as strategically, as
encompassing and as intermodal as we have,'' he said. ``I think it
will make a difference.''

<HEAD>King of the Zulu Says ANC Has Shunned Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The king of South Africa's Zulus
complained to a crowd of 70,000 Sunday that he should have been
invited to a welcoming rally for freed leaders of the outlawed
African National Congress.
   King Goodwill Zwelithini spoke at a special convention of his
people, held at a Durban sports stadium three weeks after a crowd
of similar size welcomed the ANC leaders at a mass rally outside
Johannesburg.
   Both King Goodwill and Mangosuthu Buthelezi, chief minister of
the Zulu homeland, have been at odds with the ANC over the years,
opposing the movement's use of guerrilla violence against the
white-controlled national government.
   King Goodwill suggested the ANC might seek to exclude moderate
Zulu leaders from a role in negotiations to end white-minority
domination. ``I make the great plea that we are allowed to play our
Zulu role in everything that is being done,'' the king said. ``Let
us now put black divisiveness aside.''
   Seven senior ANC leaders were freed from prison Oct. 15 and
honored two weeks later at a mass rally.
   King Goodwill complained that the ANC leaders expressed no
appreciation for Buthelezi's past appeals for the release of
political prisoners.
   ``And I as king of the Zulus ... received not one single message
about the welcoming rally,'' King Goodwill said.
   Members of Buthelezi's Inkatha movement have been engaged in a
bloody power struggle over the three years in Natal Province with
supporters of anti-apartheid groups aligned with the ANC. More than
2,000 people have been killed.
   An estimated 7 million of South Africa's 28 million blacks are
Zulus, although many do not share the political views of King
Goodwill or Buthelezi.

   Even Scrooge, on his worst bah-humbug
days, might have shed a tear at the sight.
   What appears at first glance to be a jolly Santa's workshop in
this Washington suburb is actually a torture chamber for Christmas
toys that is worthy of the Spanish Inquisition.
   Working behind closed doors in a small room stacked high with
Yuletide goodies, Bob Hundemer, the Torquemada of the toy business,
is gleefully wrenching the nose off a cuddly teddy bear.
   Nearby, a bespectacled helper is calmly dismembering a stack of
dolls with blonde tresses, yanking off their arms without a trace
of emotion. At his elbow are the shattered remains of dump trucks,
airplanes and baby rattles, and bits of stuffing from disemboweled
toy animals.
   They are working in the toy testing laboratory of the U.S.
Consumer Product Safety Commission, and their tables are crowded
with diabolical devices specifically designed to fold, spindle and
mutilate _ or worse.
   Clamps and torque wrenches are applied to the eyes of lovable
toy monkeys. Teething rings are dropped in pots of boiling water.
Stuffed bears are battered with finger-like probes.
   Is this guy the Grinch who stole Christmas, or what?
   ``No, I feel more like the good witch of the North,'' says
Hundemer, chief of the two-man laboratory which is housed in the
drab former barracks of an abandoned Nike missile site about 15
miles northwest of Washington.
   With extra help to cope with the Christmas rush, Hundemer and
his assistant, Garfield Jenkins, work full time testing about 900
toys annually for potential safety hazards to children.
   Hundemer estimates that more than two-thirds _ many of them
mass-produced imports from Mexico or the Far East _ flunk the
commission's stringent standards. They are either recalled for
redesigning or banned from the market as unfit for putting under
the Christmas tree.
   Last year, 245 toys were voluntarily recalled by manufacturers
at the agency's urging. Some of the worst offenders will be
displayed at a Dec. 1 news conference, when the commission will
give its annual Christmas warning to toy-buying parents.
   By far, the biggest threat posed by hazardous toys, which
accounted for 142,000 injuries and a minimum of 22 deaths last
year, are small parts that children can easily detach with their
teeth or fingers and put in their mouths, causing choking or
asphyxiation.
   Most choking deaths involve balloons, marbles and other small
balls, says John E. Preston, a mechanical engineer who designed
many of the agency's toy-testing procedures. But balloons and
marbles are exempt from government safety regulations because of
their universal popularity as children's playthings.
   ``Can we tolerate the 10 deaths of children every year from
choking on balloons?'' Preston asked. ``On the other hand, we don't
believe the world is ready to accept a ban on balloons and marbles.
We're perplexed about what we can do.''
   Hundemer says he has ``compelling reasons'' for his personal
interest in toy safety as the parent of two small children.
   The government can't begin to test all the 150,000 different
toys on the market, he said, ``so don't depend on the government to
provide you with complete safety.'' Parents must play an active
role in monitoring toy safety.
   Look for durability and quality of construction, he says, and
select toys suitable for a child's age and skills. Avoid buying
toys with small parts or long cords for infants or toddlers.
   Be particularly cautious about small balls and toys that shoot
projectiles or contain electrical heating elements. Consult label
precautions and follow instructions. Supervise children at play,
and repair or discard damaged toys immediately.
   ``Don't be fooled when a clerk says `we couldn't sell it if it
weren't safe,''' Hundemer said. ``That's not true, and people who
believe that are misguided.''

<HEAD>Book Depicts UPI as Victim of Mismanagement, Industry Trends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two former staff members say in a book that
United Press International has ceased to exist as a competitive
news agency, a victim of a succession of misguided managements and
of changes in the industry.
   ``There was no single reason for UPI's plunge from robust
competitor to cowering dwarf,'' say authors Gregory Gordon and
Ronald E. Cohen in their account of the difficulties of the
82-year-old agency, once a feisty underdog competitor to the
bigger, older Associated Press.
   ``But if the wire service indeed had any chances against these
outside forces,'' the authors write, ``they were squandered
repeatedly by owners and managers either inept, ill-suited or
unwilling to rise to the challenge.''
   Gordon, a former investigative reporter for UPI, is now with the
Detroit News; Cohen, former UPI managing editor, is now executive
editor of the Gannett News Service.
   UPI, currently owned by Infotechnology, Inc., parent firm to a
number of high-tech ventures, continues to cover the news and sell
its report to media subscribers.
   But in ``Down to the Wire,'' Gordon and Cohen portray the
company as mortally wounded from internal battles and no longer a
major player in the news industry.
   They say UPI is ``staggering under the burdens of decades of
management stupidity and cupidity; of neglect, low pay, miserable
working conditions; of astonishing lapses in leadership and
foresight; of a succession of owners who had exploited Unipressers'
love of company and professional pride.''
   They estimate that the company lost $135 million in the last 25
years in attempts, under four ownerships, to regain solvency.
   UPI's current management disputes the authors' depiction of UPI
as reduced to a ``gaunt shadow of its heyday.''
   ``UPI is in the fullest sense a competitor in the industry,''
said spokesman Milt Capps. ``Unfortunately the authors essentially
stopped their learning and reporting'' when Infotechnology took
over, he said.
   ``They chose to mark their own departures from UPI as the point
at which UPI ceased to exist as a news agency,'' Capps said.
``Nothing could be further from the truth.''
   He said UPI has a staff of ``nearly 800 reporters and editors
and more than 4,000 other correspondents around the world,'' has
more than 3,000 clients, expects to make ``a modest profit'' in the
fourth quarter of 1989 and in 1990, draws 4 percent of its revenues
from government and corporate clients and projects that non-media
clients will contribute 20 to 25 percent of its business base
within five years. ``The turnaround has been dramatic,'' he said.
   Gordon and Cohen say a blow to the company's chances of ever
regaining its old stature as AP's chief rival occurred when UPI's
current top executives, chairman Earl Brian and president Paul
Steinle, opted to ``unbundle'' _ to offer to sell the wire
service's news, sports and photo reports separately instead of as a
package.
   That decision, a gamble rejected by previous owners, allowed the
relatively few big city newspapers which still paid thousands of
dollars a month to cut back in what they got from UPI and what they
paid to it.
   As a result, ``newspapers in places like Boston and Seattle so
curtailed their service that UPI stories became a rarity,'' the
book says.
   But well before Brian and Steinle took over, UPI had become
competitively weak, the authors say.
   In 1982, an E. W. Scripps Co. family trust sold UPI for $1 after
absorbing losses that amounted to $80 million over 20 years. At the
time, they say, the company had more than 4,000 broadcasting
subscribers and 800 newspaper clients.
   By last summer, they say, there were half as many broadcaster
subscribers and fewer than 200 daily papers, ``the great majority,
small, single-service clients paying low rates.''
   A worldwide staff that had numbered 1,737 in 1982 was diminished
to 650, they write, and ``at times AP had as many people in Topeka
covering the Kansas legislature as UPI had covering Congress.''
   The authors list five factors, aside from internal struggles and
shortages of capital, which ``wrought immeasurable damage.''
   Among them is the structural differences between UPI, a private
concern that sold its news report to newspapers and broadcasters,
and AP, a news cooperative owned by the newspapers and broadcasters
which receive its report.
   AP, they write, was part of ``the chummy establishment that kept
its scruffy competitor rapping in vain on the country club
window.'' As a result, from the start, UPI was an underdog and
``the game was unfair, perhaps unwinnable.''
   Another factor, they say, was the 1945 Supreme Court antitrust
decision which required AP to provide its services broadly instead
of to only one member per city. The consequence was to make UPI
``divert dwindling resources into expensive coverage of state and
regional news ... a losing proposition.''
   Other causes were the demise of most large-city afternoon
papers, eager to receive late-breaking news from whichever agency
could deliver it first, and the trend which saw national news media
organizations taking over the ownership of many family-owned
newspapers, with the new owners ``less interested in supporting a
second wire service than amassing enormous profits for
stockholders.''
   Finally, the book says, a number of newspapers and news
organizations began to offer ``first rate supplemental news
services at far cheaper rates'' than those charged by UPI. ``In
truth, the very clients UPI needed to stay alive were competitors
for shrinking industry dollars and stood to benefit from the wire
service's demise.''
   UPI was organized, as United Press, in 1907 by E. W. Scripps,
founder of the country's first big newspaper group, Scripps-Howard
Newspapers.
   The Scripps empire was strong in the Midwest and the Pacific
Coast and consisted chiefly of papers published in the afternoon.
Scripps felt The AP was Eastern-oriented and dominated by morning
newspapers.
   In 1958, UP merged with a weaker competitor, the Hearst Corp.'s
International News Service, to form UPI.
   In 1981, tired of absorbing losses, Scripps looked for a buyer
and finally arranged a sale in 1982 to two Tennesseans, Donald Ruhe
and William E. Geissler.
   They sold off some of its profitable operations _ including its
overseas photo operation _ and couldn't make a go of it with what
was left, filing for Chapter 11 protection under the bankruptcy
laws. The court approved the company's sale to Mario Vazquez-Rana,
a wealthy Mexican newspaper publisher.
   Gordon and Cohen estimate that Vazquez-Rana lost $70 million
before allowing the company to come under the control of
Infotechnology.
   Gordon, an 18-year UPI veteran, was fired by UPI in May when he
refused to submit his manuscript to his employer for review. UPI
said at the time that writing a book derogatory of UPI would
violate the company's contract with the Wire Service Guild. Cohen,
a 25-year veteran, was fired in 1986 during a reorganization under
Vazquez-Rana.
   Capps said of both: ``The circumstances under which they left
had to do with things quite apart from their intention to write
this book,'' although he said Gordon's refusal to submit the
manuscript for review was a ``material'' factor.

<HEAD>IRA Says Its Bombs Killed 3 Soldiers, Injured Sergeant and Wife</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Irish Republican Army
claimed responsibility Sunday for bombs that killed three British
soldiers on patrol in Northern Ireland and injured an army sergeant
and his wife in England.
   As concerns grew about a possible pre-Christmas bombing campaign
on the British mainland, the IRA also said in a statement that it
planted the bomb defused Nov. 13 outside the London home of a
senior army general.
   Following the bombings Saturday, Home Secretary David Waddington
renewed his warning to members of the public to be extra ``vigilant
and alert.''
   George Churchill-Coleman, head of Scotland Yard's anti-terrorist
squad, urged public figures last week to take extra security
measures.
   In its statement to the news media, the IRA said:
   ``Clearly the IRA cannot be beaten. The British public, instead
of fruitlessly condemning the IRA, should be taking to the streets
and demanding the end of martial rule in Northern Ireland.''
   The IRA has targeted army installations in England and
continental Europe as well as Northern Ireland in its bloody
campaign to drive the British out of the predominantly Protestant
province and unite it with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.
   The Ministry of Defense said staff Sgt. Andrew Mudd and his wife
were driving out of the married quarters at the British army
headquarters for eastern England in Colchester, 50 miles northeast
of London, when their car exploded Saturday. People reportedly
heard the bomb one mile away.
   Mudd, 33, was in serious condition after having both legs
amputated, said Mark Shackell, spokesman for Colchester General
Hospital. Mudd's wife, whose name was not released, suffered cuts
and bruises, he said.
   Deputy Chief Constable Peter Simpson of Essex Police said his
force was searching for men seen near the barracks shortly after
the explosion.
   The army identified the three paratroopers killed hours later in
a roadside blast near the border town of Newry, County Down, as
Lance Cpl. Stephen Wilson, 23; Pvt. Donald Macaulay, 20; and Pvt.
Matthew Marshall, 21.
   A fourth soldier who was in the armored Land-Rover hurled off
the road by the bomb was ``very seriously ill'' with multiple
injuries, an army spokesman said. The soldier's name was not
released.
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary said the bomb, hidden in a
roadside wall, was probably detonated by remote control. Bomb and
forensic experts using metal detectors and helicopters with
infrared equipment searched the area make sure there were no other
bombs.
   Men in a second Land-Rover following a short distance behind
escaped injury and were able to call for help.
   Scotland had said the bomb found last week outside the London
home of Lt. Gen. David Ramsbotham, commander of the British Field
Army and inspector general of the reserve army, bore all the
hallmarks of the IRA.
   Commander Churchill-Coleman said the bomb was placed under a
neighbor's parked car and when it fell off was spotted by someone
nearby. Police evacuated the area of fashionable Kensington while
the bomb was defused.
   The soldiers' deaths raised to 10 the number of regular army
soldiers killed in Northern Ireland this year.
   Since the province's sectarian fighting began in 1969, 266
police, 601 army personnel, and 1,902 civilians have been killed.

   Step by step, Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Donald Riegle is acknowledging more and more involvement
in the controversy swirling around the nation's costliest savings
and loan failure.
   Riegle, a third-term Democrat from Michigan, refuses to answer
reporters' questions about his meeting with federal regulators who
were examining Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
   But he is among five senators who received large contributions
from Charles H. Keating Jr., chairman of Lincoln's holding company,
at a time Keating was pushing for more lenient regulation.
   The five senators met with regulators who were examining the
S&amp;L's shaky investments in April 1987, but all deny any attempt to
sway the results of the investigation.
   Keating, who is scheduled to testify before a House panel
Tuesday, has said he certainly meant to be buying influence when he
made campaign contributions to the five senators.
   Lincoln's collapse is expected to cost taxpayers between $1.5
billion and $2 billion.
   Riegle's most complete public disclosure was an Oct. 18 written
response to a Senate ethics committee query in which he wrote:
   ``At no time did I ever initiate any contact with the regulators
concerning Lincoln,'' he said. ``It is my belief that my actions
with respect to this matter were entirely proper at all times.''
   Riegle asserted his only involvement was attending an April 9,
1987, meeting with the four other senators and the regulators.
   But in response to testimony before the House Banking Committee,
Riegle and his staff have added several details:
   _Although Riegle says he doesn't remember it, aide David Krawitz
says office records show the senator met Feb. 26, 1987, with Jack
D. Atchison, Lincoln's outside auditor.
   _Riegle acknowledges discussing the Lincoln situation March 6,
1987, with Edwin Gray, then chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board. In congressional testimony, Gray said those talks led to the
two meetings in April 1987 between senators and federal regulators
that are a focal point of the controversy.
   _And last week Riegle's staff confirmed a report first published
in the trade publication American Banker that in March 1987 he took
a helicopter tour of the Arizona real estate holdings of Lincoln's
parent company, American Continental Corp., including a lavish
resort.
   Gray met April 2, 1987, with Sens. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz;
John McCain, R-Ariz.; Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and John Glenn,
D-Ohio. Riegle didn't attend, but he joined the other senators at
an April 9 meeting with bank board examiners to discuss Lincoln.
   Some witnesses at House Banking Committee hearings have partly
blamed Riegle and the other four senators for delaying the federal
takeover of Lincoln until this past April and thus making it more
costly.
   ``Riegle decided to expend his political capital and time on
behalf of the savings and loan perpetrators instead of encouraging
the formation of victims' groups to get their money back and
helping to reform the system,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader said.
   Riegle last was re-elected in 1988. He received $76,100 in
campaign contributions from Keating and his associates.
   Most of the donations were given at a March 23, 1987,
fund-raiser at the Pontchartrain Hotel in downtown Detroit, which
Keating had purchased and renovated. Riegle returned the money a
year later.
   Whatever the outcome of probes by the ethics panel and the House
Banking Committee, the political jeopardy for Riegle is obvious.
   Former Rep. Jim Dunn, defeated by Riegle in a 1988 landslide,
raised the issue of the Lincoln S&amp;L during the campaign, although
it did him little apparent good.
   Riegle's term doesn't expire until 1994, and Republicans have
said little about the controversy this year. But Michigan GOP
Chairman Spencer Abraham said Friday that Riegle should step aside
as Banking Committee chairman until the probe is finished.
   ``If he does not make a full disclosure to the people of this
state, I think I would want to re-examine whether he is fit to
serve as our senator,'' Abraham said.

   Israeli soldiers in the Gaza Strip arrested a
Palestinian informer Sunday and accused him of being the ``Tel Aviv
strangler,'' who killed four Jews and three Israeli Arabs in one
the country's worst murder cases.
   ``It's certain! I killed them!'' Mohammed Halabi shouted at
reporters as police led him in handcuffs into Tel Aviv's police
station. ``Why? I am now religious. ... There were some among them
who were collaborators and others among them who were prostitutes.''
   More than 147 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs for
allegedly collaborating with Israel or engaging in prostitution
during the 23-month-old Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Israel radio said police
believe Halabi killed the five women and two men as the result of a
dispute.
   Newspapers have reported that the 32-year-old suspect began
informing for the Shin Bet secret service in 1985 after he was
released six years early from an 11-year jail sentence for drug
trafficking and prostitution.
   The independent Yediot Ahronot daily has said underground
Palestinian popular committees sentenced him to death for
collaboration after reports were published of his cooperation with
the Shin Bet, the agency responsible for internal security in
Israel.
   Tel Aviv Police Chief Avi Dotan said on Israel radio there was
an ``unambiguous link'' between Halabi and the seven victims, who
were strangled with nylon rope. Their bodies were found Oct. 20 in
two apartments in Tel Aviv and neighboring Jaffa.
   Halabi surrendered without a struggle after troops and security
agents kicked in the door of a shack where he was sleeping in the
Gaza Strip town of Khan Yunis, police officials said.
   ``I thank Hamas for making me a good and religious man who
believes in God,'' Halabi said at the police station. His remarks
were carried on Israel radio.
   Hamas, Arabic for ``zeal,'' is a Moslem fundamentalist group
that has been at the forefront of the Palestinian uprising.
   Tel Aviv Police spokeswoman Dalia Gilad, reached by telephone,
said police were checking whether Halabi was linked to Hamas or
``used the name for convenience.''
   She also confirmed that Halabi, of the Jebaliya refugee camp in
Gaza, worked in the past for Shin Bet.
   It was unclear from newspaper reports what information Halebi
provided Shin Bet and whether he had informed on Gaza Strip
uprising activists.
   There have been repeated allegations Shin Bet uses petty
criminals as informers in the occupied territories. The stranglings
sparked outrage in Israel and led several right-wing politicians to
demand tighter restrictions on the entry of Palestinians into
Israel.
   Gaza Arabs are banned from staying overnight in Israel and must
have a magnetic card issued by the military administration to pass
through army checkpoints and enter Israel. Those cards are only
granted to Arabs who pass security checks and have paid taxes.

   The military government has released from
prison former Prime Minister Sadek el-Mahdi and several political
leaders and placed them under house arrest, a state-run newspaper
said Sunday.
   The paper, Al-Ingaz al-Watani, said el-Mahdi and the other
political detainees left Kober prison Friday for their homes.
   But Col. Suleiman Mohamed Suleiman, a member of the 15-man
ruling military junta that ousted el-Mahdi and his elected civilian
government in a coup June 30, was quoted by the Egyptian Middle
East News Agency as denying the report.
   He was quoted as saying el-Mahdi and other leaders would not be
freed until they are cleared by a corruption investigation.
   Following the coup, Sudan's military ruler, Lt. Col. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir, disbanded all political parties and trade unions and put
their leaders in prison. He has repeatedly accused them of
political and economic corruption and vowed to put them on trial.
Only a handful of them have been tried.
   The government has said it was holding about 30 political
detainees, but informed sources said the figure was closer to 100.
   News reports have claimed the government tortured el-Mahdi and
the others. London-based Amnesty International, which monitors
human rights abuses, said el-Mahdi was abused and subjected to a
mock trial for failing to support the new government. The military
government denied the allegations.
   The newspaper said that besides el-Mahidi, the government
released from prison Mohamed Osman el-Mirghani, leader of Sudan's
second largest political party, the centrist Democratic Unionist;
and Hassan Turabi, the leader of the small but powerful Moslem
fundamentalist National Islamic Front.
   Noticeably absent from the list of those reportedly released was
Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary-general of the Communist Party.
   During the past month, the military government has been
releasing small numbers of political detainees including former
Cabinet ministers.
   The newspaper said the releases were ``due to the political
stability'' in the country since the coup.
   El-Bashir has vowed never to allow Sudan's 36 political parties
to be formed again. He accused them of being the main reason for
the continuation of the nation's 6{-year-old civil war with rebels
and the deteriorating economy.
   The rebels of this East African nation took up arms in 1983,
demanding greater autonomy for the southern region of the country.
   In Nairobi, Kenya on Sunday, former President Jimmy Carter
announced that the Sudanese government and the rebels will meet for
preliminary peace talks Dec. 1.
   Carter made the announcement upon arriving in Nairobi to mediate
a second round of talks between the Ethiopian government and rebels
there.
   Carter said el-Bashir, and Col. John Garang, head of the
Sudanese People's Liberation Army, agreed Saturday to meet without
preconditions and without a mediator.

   A statement published in a newspaper
Sunday claimed the Basque separatist organization ETA killed an
army officer in Madrid last week and seriously wounded his driver.
   The officer, Lt. Col. Jose Maria Martinez Moreno, was killed
Friday and his 20-year-old driver, Alfonso de los Reyes, was shot
in the neck by men who attacked their military vehicle at one of
Madrid's busiest intersections.
   The claim of responsibility, in the form of a note, was printed
in Egin, a newspaper in the northern city of San Sebastian.
   The note also claimed ETA responsibility for the slaying of a
man in Bilbao who died Wednesday when a bomb blew up his truck. The
statement claimed that Ignacio Banuelos Laso, 26, was slain because
he was a drug trafficker.
   ETA, whose initials stand for Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, has killed 17 people this year in its 11-year-old
campaign to gain self-determination for the three-province northern
Spanish Basque country.

   Nuns in a Roman convent were startled when a block
of green ice shattered one of their windows Sunday. Authorities
said it appeared the ice may have fallen from an airplane.
   After the green ice crashed through the window, the nuns called
the police, claiming they had been struck by meteorites, the
Rome-based daily Il Tempo said. They then put it in the freezer.
   Firefighters carrying Geiger counters rushed to the San Felice
da Cantalice convent in central Rome, followed by an expert from
the National Center for Research, who determined the ice was
emitting no radiation, the daily reported.
   After shattering the window the ice broke into three pieces,
each about the size of a fist. They weighed a total of about two
pounds, it said.
   It was not clear why the ice was green.

   Leaders of the 12 European Community nations have
begun to lay the basis for a new relationship with East European
nations in the midst of political and economic reforms.
   But in doing so, they have made clear this is no time for
Western Europe to forsake either the NATO military alliance or the
further integration of the EC economies.
   At a summit dinner Saturday given by President Francois
Mitterrand, the 12 Western leaders agreed to consider forming a
development bank for Eastern Europe and to help train managers in
the newly emerging democracies.
   ``(The EC) wants to increase its encouragement to the reform
movements everywhere in Europe, which will accelerate the decline
of totalitarianism,'' Mitterrand said.
   He called the summit so Europeans could assess the rapid events
in Eastern Europe before the Dec. 2-3 meeting off Malta between
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Both British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and West German
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher are to meet separately with
Bush this week. Mitterrand is expected to see Bush sometime next
month.
   ``We declare ourselves ready to cooperate in anything that will
help the reform of the Eastern countries, which are going through a
sometimes dramatic economic crisis,'' the French leader said
Saturday night.
   ``We are ready to ... contribute with all our means to this
restoration, to this installation of a healthy economy, at the
price, of course ... of a verified return to democracy.''
   The EC leaders pledged more aid to Poland and Hungary until the
two countries work out financial packages with the International
Monetary Fund.
   ``We feel we must give more aid,'' said Mrs. Thatcher. ``They
have to get through the winter.''
   Since September, the Soviet bloc's first non-Communist
government has come to power in Poland; Hungary has begun moves
toward a democracy; and East Germany's hard-line leader, Erich
Honecker, has been replaced by reform-minded Egon Krenz.
   The Krenz government opened the country's borders Nov. 9 and
began knocking holes in the Berlin Wall the following day, leading
to speculation of reunification of the two German republics.
   That has sparked fears that West Germany, the most powerful
economy in the EC, might lessen its commitment to the Community in
favor of closer ties with East Germany.
   At the summit, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl went out of
his way to allay those fears.
   ``I clearly told my colleagues that ... there is no alternative
(to EC membership),'' Kohl told reporters. ``He who says anything
different of German policy does not tell the truth.''
   Mrs. Thatcher, without referring directly to Germany, said,
``The question of borders is not on the agenda. They should stay as
they are.''
   She added it was imperative not to weaken the security role of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``At a time of great change, it's necessary to keep the
background of stability and security,'' she told a post-summit news
conference. ``We are all aware ... that the unification (of the EC)
now has priority more than ever.''
   Tying the economies of the 12 EC nations closer together centers
on a plan to forge a monetary union by the mid-1990s, including the
creation of a central banking system and, eventually, a single EC
currency. Mrs. Thatcher opposes the plan, fearing it would put too
much power in the hands of a central European Bank.
   Mitterrand is keen on settling the issue at a Dec. 8-9 EC summit
meeting in Strasbourg, France.
   The EC includes the European Economic Community, also known as
the Common Market, the European Atomic Energy Commission and the
European Coal and Steel Community. Its members are Belgium,
Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<HEAD>Dodd Predicts U.S. Aid Restriction Unless Cristiani Gets Grip by
January</HEAD>

   Congress is likely to impose conditions on
further U.S. aid to El Salvador if the embattled Central American
country's President Alfredo Cristiani fails to demonstrate by
January that he is firmly in control, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd said
Sunday.
   The Connecticut Democrat, who is chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Western hemisphere affairs, said on NBC's
``Meet the Press'' that he doesn't favor any immediate move to cut
back aid in the wake of last week's slayings of six Jesuit priests
in El Salvador.
   ``I see no action being taken over the next several days, prior
to adjournment,'' he said. ``So this period between the end of
November and January (when Congress reconvenes) will be a critical
period.''
   Dodd said that ``if President Cristiani demonstrates that he can
regain control, that he's not going to allow the death squads to
operate, then I think you minimize the possibility of reducing
aid.''
   However, he said, if Cristiani is not in ``political control''
by January, ``there will certainly be some conditionality placed on
that aid when Congress comes back.''
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., interviewed on the same program, said
about the killing of the priests that ``President Cristiani has
already come forward and said he thought that this was a barbaric
act, that there should be investigations. He asked for assistance.''
   The slayings came during the biggest offensive mounted by
leftist guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front
during the 10-year-old war. Fighting has raged in the capital of
San Salvador and throughout the country since it was launched a
week ago.
   Mack said that ``I think we ought to be concentrating on what in
fact the guerrillas have been up to. Their intentions, I think,
were clear _ to try to decapitate the Cristiani government. This is
an act of desperation, I believe.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney will visit the Netherlands next week, making him the first
U.S. official to meet this nation's new center-left government, the
Defense Ministry said Sunday.
   No agenda items have been disclosed for Cheney's two-day trip,
which begins Sunday, and it is not related to the Dec. 2-3
superpower summit off the Malta coast, according to a ministry
spokesman.
   Cheney was invited earlier this year by Frits Bolkesteijn,
defense minister in Premier Ruud Lubbers' center-right government,
said the spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line
with ministry policy.
   Bolkesteijn is a member of the right-wing Liberal party, a
staunchly pro-NATO group that is now in the opposition.
   Cheney will now meet Bolkesteijn's successor, Relus ter Beek, a
Labor Party member known for his pro-disarmament views and
commitment to slashing defense spending.
   The new Dutch government, the third headed by Lubbers, has
announced it will cut the growth in defense spending to about .6
percent of the Netherlands' net national income and aim for zero
growth after two years.
   The new government took office last week, following a national
election Sept. 6.
   In the early 1980s, the Labor Party was strongly opposed to
plans to put 48 nuclear-tipped U.S. cruise missiles on Dutch soil.
That stance effectively banished Ter Beek's group to the opposition
benches for the better part of the decade.
   Lubbers decided to accept the missiles in 1985, but they were
never brought in because of the superpower pact on
intermediate-range nuclear forces.

   The Prince and Princess of Wales said Sunday they
``deplore'' the publication of photos of their sons William and
Harry apparently taken in private gardens at their school.
   Two front-page photos in the Sunday tabloid People show
7-year-old Prince William in a pose captioned: ``Willie's sly pee
in park.''
   On inside pages are five photographs of Prince Harry, 5, headed:
``His Royal Cry-ness,'' showing what appears to be a tussle with
some schoolmates. The caption claims: ``Shyboy Harry hates his pals
ragging him.''
   In a statement issued on their behalf, Prince Charles and his
wife, Diana, called the pictures ``intrusive and irresponsible''
and expressed concern about the children's security.
   The statement, issued by the private secretary of Queen
Elizabeth II, said, ``The Prince and Princess of Wales have
regularly asked editors to respect the privacy of Prince William
and Prince Harry at school as they want the two young children to
have as normal a school life as possible.''
   ``In addition, the attentions of paparazzi photographers have
obvious security implications.
   ``We therefore deplore the publication of the seven photographs
of Prince William and Prince Harry in today's People newspaper as
intrusive and irresponsible.''
   The pictures were believed to have been taken in the private
square fronting Wetherby School.

   Jane Pauley's departure from the ``Today'' show
means she'll be home for breakfast _ and the family is worried.
   Her husband, ``Doonesbury'' cartoonist Garry Trudeau, has been
responsible for getting their three children, 5-year-old twins and
a 3-year-old son, up and ready for the day.
   In the December issue of Life, Trudeau recalled one recent
morning when Pauley stayed home and almost everything appalled her:
   ``You're not letting her wear her hair like that! ... Why are
they wearing their school clothes before breakfast? ... You let her
eat that for breakfast?''
   Trudeau said he and the children finally rebelled:
   ``Yo, Mom! We're doing fine for five years. Nobody's got scurvy,
and we're all wearing clean underwear. Where's the problem?''
   He said he thinks things will settle down once Pauley gets
``integrated into the morning.''

establishment of a special fund to support young Polish writers
during a Sunday breakfast attended by Polish leader Lech Walesa.
   Michener, whose novels include one called ``Poland,'' last year
received Poland's highest award in honor of ``his respect and

   Michener said the $400,000 fund will be used to support the
publication of books, magazines, newspaper articles and criticisms
rejected by commercial publishers.
   In 1980, Michener and the Copernicus Society established a
similar fund for young American writers at the University of Iowa.

spokeswoman said.
   ``We popped the question to Tom T. Hall because he's the kind of
person who has a great deal of respect for and experience in
creative writing,'' spokeswoman Dot Harrison said Friday. ``We knew
he would be the kind of person we could get to help us sponsor the
program.''
   Ms. Harrison said details of the Tom T. Hall Chair of Excellence
in Creative Writing were still being worked out. The position is
initially expected to be filled by MTSU English professor Robert
Herring, author of the novels ``Hub'' and ``McCampbell's War.''
   Herring will teach courses and serve as a ``resident expert'' to
advise writers in both the English department and School of
Communications.
   The university already has seven Chairs of Excellence, which are
part of a statewide program to attract outstanding scholars to
Tennessee universities. They are funded jointly by state money and
private donations.
   Hall, who lives in Franklin, wrote pop and country songs
including ``Harper Valley PTA,'' ``Old Dogs, Children and
Watermelon Wine'' and ``I Love.'' Hall also has written children's
books and short stories.

   U.S. Ambassador John McCarthy presented
his credentials and pledged the United States' support for new
President Rene Mouawad amid joyous parades Sunday in Syrian-policed
northern Lebanon.
   The latest U.S. pledge was contained in a message from President
Bush, which McCarthy handed to Mouawad along with his letter of
credence.
   The message also stressed support for an Arab League-brokered
peace pact approved by Parliament at a special session held last
month in Taif, Saudi Arabia, over the objections of Christian
leader Gen. Michel Aoun.
   McCarthy, who withdrew in September after reported threats from
Aoun, became the first foreign diplomat to present his credentials
to Mouawad since Parliament elected the Catholic lawmaker as
president Nov. 5.
   It also was the first time in Lebanon's modern history that a
foreign ambassador presented his credentials outside the
traditional seat of the head of state in Baabda east of Beirut.
Aoun occupies the presidential palace.
   About 5,000 Aoun loyalists staged what they called a ``freedom
rally'' in Christian east Beirut. They brandished Lebanese flags
and Aoun's pictures, chanting ``with blood, with souls, we support
the general'' during the hour-long display televised on Aoun's
television station.
   Bush, in the letter, assured Mouawad of ``the steadfast support
of the United States for your presidency and for Lebanon.''
   ``We intend to work hard in the days and weeks ahead to manifest
our support,'' Bush said. The text of the letter was made available
to reporters by the Mouawad's press office.
   ``I hope your election as president will finally bring an end to
the senseless violence that Lebanon has had to endure for far too
long.
   ``We believe that the implemenation of the Taif agreement will
be the first step toward the restoration of the unity, independence
and sovereignty of Lebanon over all its territory, free from all
foreign occupation,'' Bush added.
   Some 50,000 drum-beating supporters of Mouawad, a Maronite
Catholic, marched through the streets of Ehden in the foothills of
the Cedar Mountains as McCarthy presented his credentials at
Mouawad's ancestral palace.
   Dozens of ululating women tossed red and yellow roses at
McCarthy's bulletproof white Cadillac when it pulled to a stop at
the palace at 11 a.m.
   As the ambassador and his first secretary David Sutterfield
climbed out of the limousine, the women sprayed them with rose
water and rice in the traditional expression of welcome.
   Mouawad, 64, was flanked by senior Christian and Moslem
politicians during the ceremony. A band of honor played the
national anthems of the two countries in the courtyard.
   McCarthy said Mouawad's election ``is the end of the storm from
our point of view. ... The ship is nearly back in port.''
   McCarthy left for Damascus, Syria, after the ceremony and a
lunch with Mouawad to catch a flight back to the United States.
   The U.S. Embassy is in the east Beirut suburb of Aukar, which is
controlled by Aoun's troops. McCarthy and other U.S. diplomats
evacuated the embassy on Sept. 6 after Aoun loyalists besieged it
and left Lebanon.
   Aoun, who heads an interim Cabinet that he considers the sole
legitimate authorities in Lebanon, rejected as unconstitutional
Mouawad's election. He called the president ``a Syrian lackey
elected under the bayonets of Syrian occupation.'' He rejected the
Taif accord because it failed to set a timetable for a withdrawal
of the 40,000 Syrian troops who control 70 percent of Lebanon. Aoun
is backed by 20,000 mainly Christian troops.

<HEAD>Georgia Declares Right to Secede From Soviet Union</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Georgia's legislature declared Sunday that the
republic's incorporation into the Soviet Union nearly 70 years ago
resulted from a military intervention and said it retains the right
to secede.
   The lawmakers also said they reserve the right to cancel Soviet
laws that are not in the best interest of their southern republic.
   The strong statements by the Supreme Soviet of Georgia further
complicate the Kremlin's attempts to rein in the 15 Soviet
republics at a time when ethnic tensions and drives for
independence are mounting.
   Georgian nationalist activists, at the price of imprisonment,
have maintained for decades that the republic was taken by force
when the Soviet Red Army invaded in 1921, ending three years of
independence.
   The official Soviet view, shared by Georgian leaders, was that
the operation was necessary to rid Georgia of forces opposing the
Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. On Sunday, Georgian leaders made an
about-face.
   ``From a legal viewpoint, the entry of troops into Georgia and
the seizing of the entire territory was military interference, or
intervention, and occupation with the goal of changing the existing
political structure,'' Tass quoted a declaration as saying from the
legislative session in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi.
   The report said the Georgian legislature approved a commission's
report containing that declaration and also branding the
incorporation of the republic, ``for all intents and purposes, an
annexation.''
   An informal Georgian political group, the National Independence
Party of Georgia, has been calling on Georgia's 5.4 million people
to boycott forthcoming elections to the Supreme Soviet to press for
independence.
   In April, 19 people were killed during a pro-independence
demonstration in Tbilisi when troops charged a crowd. A 20th was
shot and killed by police later for violating a curfew.
   The lawmakers voted to ask the national parliament, the Congress
of People's Deputies, to review the report at its next session Dec.
12.
   In another challenge to the Kremlin, the Georgian Supreme Soviet
said the republic ``reserves for itself the right of freely leaving
the U.S.S.R.'' and reserves the right to cancel Soviet laws if they
are not in Georgia's interest.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has repeatedly ruled out
redrawing the country's borders, and on Nov. 10 the Presidium, or
executive council, of the nation's legislature criticized four
other republics for similar declarations.
   The Presidium said laws in Azerbaijan and the three Baltic
republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia have no force because
they contradict the Soviet Constitution. The officials did not
specify which laws they meant, but the four republics' parliaments
have passed measures declaring their ``sovereignty'' and reserving
the right to veto laws passed in Moscow.

   The death of a black burglary suspect who
was chased by residents and suffocated when he was pinned down in a
field has this small town dodging charges of racism.
   It has trapped some of its residents between a lost innocence
and what they fear is the hopeless task of convincing outsiders
they are not racists who chased James Oliver King Jr. merely
because he was black.
   ``This is never going to go away,'' said James Lucko, one of
King's pursuers and mayor of the town, 60 miles south of Dallas.
   A few have promised as much, including one former mayor who
plans to organize a protest march against the racism he contends
struck down King. About 70 of the town's 300 residents are black.
   But others say those charges are fueled by the former mayor's
grudge against the city and the loss of business at his store, and
they grieve at the suggestion of racism.
   ``It ain't right,'' said Martin Degner. ``Please, let us get
back to our little old country life.''
   Meanwhile, Pearlie Mae King of Waco is crying over the month-old
grave of her son. Thursday would have been his 25th birthday, and
he had promised her he was changing his life.
   But like other things in King's young life, plans went awry.
   He quit school in 1982 to become a construction worker. He also
became an inept criminal. Four times he was jailed for theft and
burglary charges, and in 1983 he was sentenced to serve three years
for burglary.
   ``I wanted to get some money to get him out of jail, but he told
me to let him stay,'' Mrs. King recalled. ``He said, `I did wrong
and I'm going to pay for it.' And he went and served his time.''
   He had been living with his mother and outwardly appeared to be
trying to make good on his life.
   But Oct. 9, he allegedly broke into a home in Malone, 25 miles
to the north. Emma Piel said she came home that afternoon and found
King standing in her bedroom.
   He ran from the home; she hurried to Lucko's grocery store.
   Soon, several men were chasing King. The chase wound around town
as the suspect jumped over gates, ran down alleyways and slid
through fences. Somewhere along the way, he picked up a brick, the
men said later.
   ``When we had him trapped for a time inside a goatpen, I told
him to put the brick down,'' Lucko recalled. ``I said, `Just talk
to me.'
   ``But he said, `No, touch me and you're going to get hurt.'''
   At one point, Ray Watson said he aimed a .22-caliber pistol as
King was being chased toward him down an alley. But he said he
couldn't bring himselt to fire because ``I could no more have shot
that man than I could fly.''
   Trying to flee across a freshly plowed field, King was quickly
surrounded and overcome by three men. Lucko sat across King's legs
while two others held his arms, trying to get him to let go of the
brick and hold him until officers arrived.
   ``After five or seven minutes, he let go of the brick and we
quit restraining him as hard,'' said Lucko.
   Lucko said they were stunned when a Hill County deputy told them
the man was dead. Attempts to revive him failed.
   ``All we wanted to do is retain him. Nobody wanted to kill
him,'' said Watson, who followed the chase in his truck.
   John Parker, a medical examiner in Dallas, ruled King's death a
homicide, saying it was caused by sustained pressure on his chest
and abdomen and strangulation. Tests for drugs and alcohol were
negative.
   ``It was not a classic accident. That's why we called it a
homicide. It was very unusual,'' Parker said.
   But a grand jury Tuesday declined to issue any indictments in
the case.
   ``I think all of these men were doing what they thought was
right and what they thought was their civic duty, and I don't think
that can be said of everybody these days,'' said Hill County
District Attorney Dan Dent.
   Mrs. King planted a small cedar tree on her son's grave Thursday.
   ``Although I know they killed my baby, I don't have hatred in my
heart for those peoples,'' she said. ``I'm going to pray for them.
   ``I want justice, but it's not going to bring him back. I just
want someone to talk to me and tell me what happened.''
   Watson, the town's mayor pro tem, says he plans to invite Mrs.
King to town to discuss her son's death.
   ``These big-city reporters came out here and tried to glorify
this. But it was not racial. It was not vigilante,'' he said.
   Tommy Westmoreland is among those complaining most vigorously,
saying King would still be alive if he were white. Westmoreland,
who is white, ia trying to organize a protest march next weekend
and hopes to invite King's parents.
   The owner of a grocery store, he acknowledges some have asked if
he has an ax to grind against Lucko, who owns the town's only other
grocery store. He is embroiled in a zoning dispute with the city
because officials contend he illegally built a store addition.
   ``I don't have to bring Lucko down this way,'' Westmoreland
said. ``But there's racism in this town. They see me as a
hell-raiser.''
   If there is racism, some of the town's blacks don't see if that
way.
   ``They treat me right,'' said Walter Thompson as he entered
Westmoreland's store. ``That's all I can say. They treat me all
right.''

<HEAD>Cut U.S. Forces in Europe, Say Former National Security Advisers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States should cut its forces in
Europe and the Western military alliance must adapt to reforms in
the Soviet Bloc, two former White House national security advisers
said Sunday.
   ``The pattern of postwar politics as it has developed for the
last 40 years is now at an end,'' Henry Kissinger, the former
national security adviser and secretary of state from the Nixon and
Ford administrations, said in a televised interview.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney also said that up to 40,000 U.S.
troops could be withdrawn from Europe through ongoing East-West
negotiations and that the Pentagon budget could be cut because of
the declining Soviet threat.
   And Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's security adviser,
urged that billions of dollars be shifted from defense to help the
nations of Eastern Europe move from communism to democracy and a
market economy.
   The ideas and proposals came as East Europeans, inspired by the
policies of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, instituted their
own reforms that have kept the West scrambling to keep pace.
   Kissinger, Cheney and Brzezinski, in separate television
interviews, agreed the Soviet military threat was subsiding.
Kissinger predicted that East and West Germany would be reunited
within five years, and said a unified Germany should be integrated
into existing Western security and economic arrangements.
   ``In the immediate future, I think that the use of military
force in Soviet foreign policy is sharply reduced, although I think
it is much too early to draw a final balance sheet since the
process hasn't worked itself out yet in the Soviet Union, and not
even in Eastern Europe,'' said Kissinger.
   ``I agree that NATO has to be recast. The present American
military establishment in Europe cannot be and should not be
maintained. But one has to make that part of a general European
security system,'' said Kissinger, appearing on the ABC-TV program,
``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Cheney, appearing later on the same program, said, ``It's clear
that the likelihood of all-out conflict between the US and the
Soviet Union, between NATO and the Warsaw Pact, is probably lower
now than it's been at just about any time since the end of World
War II.''
   While administration officials have said they see no need to
change the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Cheney said he hoped
that NATO and Warsaw Pact negotiations would finish work within a
year on President Bush's proposal to cut U.S. forces in Europe by
40,000.
   The conventional force negotiations would require both
superpowers to reduce their military presence in Central Europe,
with much sharper cuts in troops and tanks by the Soviet Union.
   Brzezinski, who recently returned from Moscow, proposed a
Central European recovery fund along the lines of the Marshall Plan
that promoted West European economic recovery after World War II.
   ``We spend about $150 billion on the defense of Europe, about
half of our defense budget,'' Brzezinski said on the NBC-TV
program, ``Meet the Press.''
   ``If we can reduce the level of the confrontation in Central
Europe, we will gain flexibility in dealing with Central Europe
economically, financially, that we haven't had until now,'' he said.
   Congress has authorized $938 million to bolster reform
governments in Poland and Hungary over the next three years, about
twice the level proposed by the Bush administration. However,
legislation to actually appropriate that and other foreign aid
money is bogged down over other matters, including whether to
withhold money from United Nations family planning programs that
might encourage abortion.
   Brzezinski said money saved on defense and used ``for the
creation of a Central European recovery fund ... would give the
United States the point of departure for restructuring existing
arrangements in Central Europe ... together with the West Europeans
and the Japanese.''
   On Germany unification, said Kissinger, ``I do not believe that
it is desirable for the West to let itself be maneuvered into the
position where we collude with the Soviet Union in keeping Germany
divided. It would be highly dangerous if we got in the way of what
the people of Germany want.''
   The security of Europe has been shattered repeatedly over the
past century because of expanding German economic and military
might, he noted.
   Faced with rapid change, he said, the West must ``negotiate the
pace, negotiate security arrangements in Central Europe, and
hopefully see that Germany remains part of the European Community
and the Western security system. And that is a tall order.''
   ``One of the tasks of American diplomacy and Western diplomacy
is to convince the Soviets that a Germany integrated into the West
in some manner together with a security system in Europe is safer
for the Soviet Union, and I would argue especially for the Soviet
Union, than a Germany of 80 million especially as a loose cannon in
the center of Europe trying to play both sides against the
middle,'' he said.

<HEAD>Governor's Wife Out Of Hospital For Weekend.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kitty Dukakis, hospitalized two weeks ago after
swallowing some rubbing alcohol, had a weekend away from the
hospital as she spent time with family and friends.
   Mrs. Dukakis left New England Deaconess Hospital on Friday night
``to be home with her family for parts of this weekend,'' said
Mindy Lubber, spokeswoman for Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
   ``She will be back and forth to the hospital for further
treatment,'' Lubber added. She declined to estimate how long the
treatment might last.
   Mrs. Dukakis, 52, was part of a group that had lunch Saturday at
a Boston eatery, a restaurateur said.
   The governor's wife ``looked great; she looked wonderful,'' said
Diane Puopolo, co-owner of the West End Grille. ``She looked like
she really had her act together, like she has less pressure on
her.''
   Mrs. Dukakis, a recovering alcoholic, was rushed to Brigham and
Women's Hospital on Nov. 6 after ingesting the toxic rubbing
alcohol.
   The hospitalization came almost exactly one year to the day when
Dukakis lost the election for president.
   She was transferred Wednesday to a unit of New England Deaconess
Hospital that specializes in treating mood disorders.
   Mrs. Dukakis disclosed several years ago she had overcome a
longtime addiction to diet pills.
   In February, she was treated for alcoholism at a private Rhode
Island clinic, Edgehill-Newport. At the time, her family said that
the stress of her husband's failed presidential campaign was a key
reason for her drinking problem.
   The governor, whose announced earlier this year that he was not
running for re-election in 1990, ruled out resigning after his
wife's latest illness.
   He issued in a statement saying he had ``great faith in her and
her ability to rebound'' and promising to ``stand by her, just as
she's always stood by me. We're in this thing together.''

<HEAD>Leftist Guerrrillas Threaten Colombian Oil Industry</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government will not yield to leftist
rebel demands for a freeze in gasoline prices, the state petroleum
chief said in a report Sunday after guerrilla threats of attacks on
petroleum facilities.
   The National Liberation Army, known as ELN, said Saturday in a
message to a national petroleum forum that it will renew its
attacks on the industry if the government carries out a planned
gasoline price rise at the end of this month.
   Andres Restrepo Londono, president of the government petroleum
company Ecopetrol, indicated at the forum in Bogota that the
unspecified price rise would go through as planned.
   ``My answer (to the ELN) is based on principles. ... For the
government, any type of extortion is unacceptable,'' Restrepo
Londono was quoted as saying in the Sunday edition of El Tiempo,
the country's leading newspaper.
   The ELN's threat to renew its attacks came days after the
government announced record oil production of 440,000 barrels for
the month of October.
   Industry experts predict petroleum will become Colombia's
principal foreign exchange earner next year, surpassing coffee,
which has fallen dramatically in price since the August breakup of
an international coffee agreement.
   Last year, petroleum exports earned Colombia $937 million in
foreign exchange, according to Ecopetrol. Colombia earned $1.6
billion in foreign exchange from coffee sales the same year.
   Ecopetrol estimates petroleum earnings will drop to $900 million
this year because of ELN attacks, which have cost the industry $485
million since they began in 1986.
   The guerrilla group, inspired by the teachings of Fidel Castro
and led by a defrocked priest, has perpetrated 112 firebomb and
dynamite attacks on the country's main oil pipeline and other
Ecopetrol facilities. The pipeline runs between the eastern Cano
Limon oil field and the Atlantic coast.
   
   The leftist guerrilla group is using the attacks to try to
pressure the government into nationalizing the country's petroleum
industry.

<HEAD>Cnadian Prime Minister Calls For Support Of Gorbachev Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
on Sunday praised the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev during a stop on his visit to the Soviet Union.
   The Soviet president is ``a genuine reformer ... and should be
supported,'' Mulroney told reporters after meeting with Sweden's
prime minister, Ingvar Carlsson. ``Clearly, this man has taken his
part of the world down a brand new path.''
   He referred to the changes toward a more open society that have
occurred in the Soviet Union and other East bloc countries since
Gorbachev launched his bid to restructure the Communist society in
1986.
   Mulroney, who begins a five-day visit to the Soviet Union on
Monday, is the highest ranking foreign statesman to meet with
Gorbachev since East Germany began knocking down sections of the
Berlin Wall on Nov. 10. He is also the first Canadian prime
minister to officially visit the Soviet Union since 1971.
   Mulroney was scheduled to have bilateral talks with Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov on Monday and will meet Gorbachev on Tuesday. He
was expected to sign trade agreements and may conclude a
cooperation agreement for the Arctic region, encompassing science
and technology.
   Before leaving for Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, on
Wednesday, Mulroney will attend the inauguration of the
Canada-U.S.S.R. Business Council. Officials say about 200 Canadian
businessmen were expected in Moscow the same time as Mulroney.

<HEAD>Navies To Keep Tabs On Merchant Ships Till Iran-Iraq Peace Agreement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A British warship commander said Sunday
that foreign navies will remain in the Persian Gulf to protect
merchant ships as long as Iran and Iraq technically remain at war,
15 months after a U.N.-brokered cease-fire.
   ``It's not as tense as last year, and it's all very routine,''
said Cmdr. Paul D. Stone. ``But the situation is still unstable as
there's no lasting peace.''
   Stone, commander of the guided missile destroyer HMS Manchester,
warned: ``It doesn't take much to start an incident.''
   He spoke to a group of reporters who visited the Manchester
while on a port call to Bahrain. The vessel is part of four-unit
Armilla Patrol _ three warships and a navy tanker _ that Britain
maintains in the gulf.
   Britain and other Western powers that beefed up their military
presence in the waterway at the height of the Iran-Iraq war reduced
the number of their vessels in the region after the cease-fire took
hold Aug. 20, 1988.
   But peace negotiations launched after the truce have made no
progress toward a permanent settlement of the conflict, which began
in 1980.
   The Soviet Union had seven to nine units in the waterway before
the cease-fire, and Stone said they were now down to ``about three
or four warships and a couple of support ships at any time.''
   The United States maintains some 10 units in the region,
including three minesweepers inside the Persian Gulf and a
battleship group of seven to eight units in the Arabian Sea, Navy
spokesman Joe Bartlett said last week.
   The navy units escorted marchant vessels flying their national
flags at the peak of the Iran-Iraq hostilities to protect them from
fallout of the war on the waterway. They now just a watch from a
distance.
   ``We keep tabs and we chat them up occasionally ... and they are
very happy to have us here as an insurance policy,'' Stone said.
   ``Occasionally we see an Iranian warship, we talk to them, they
speak jolly good English and they are friendly,'' he said.
   About 550 merchant vessels of different nationalities were
damaged or destroyed in the Persian Gulf during the war.

   Buck Helm, the longshoreman rescued from a
flattened freeway 3{ days after the Oct. 17 earthquake, was mourned
Sunday as a gutsy symbol of endurance. His death raised the toll
from the quake to 67.
   Helm, 58, died of respiratory failure Saturday night at
Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, said hospital
spokesman Ron Treleven. No other details on his death were
available.
   ``Buck's passing pretty much took everyone by surprise because
he was improving,'' Gary Frischer, a spokesman for Helm's family,
said in a statement.
   Helm had been taken off a kidney dialysis machine, and doctors
had hoped to wean him from the respirator that had enabled him to
breathe.
   His death raised the toll from the collapse of the double-deck
Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to 42. Overall, the 7.1-magnitude quake
killed 67 people, injured more than 2,800, left more than 14,000
homeless and caused an estimated $7 billion in damage.
   ``To many, Buck had become a symbol of survival and hope,''
Frischer said. ``For the Helmses, the thousands of cards and
letters from all corners of the world gave Buck and the family
strength and encouragement, and for that they are forever
grateful.''
   Others were rescued from the 1\-mile collapsed section of
Interstate 880 shortly after the quake hit, but Helm was the only
person to be pulled alive from the rubble after rescue crews began
searching the wrecked road.
   Rescuers had given up hope of finding more survivors when an
engineer testing the structure's stability saw Helm wave from
inside his small car Oct. 21. A large beam that fell in front of
Helm's Chevrolet Sprint saved it from being flattened.
   The 220-pound, 5-foot-10 Helm suffered a fractured skull,
fractured neck, three broken ribs, nerve damage to his leg and
kidney problems caused by dehydration. He already had diabetes and
high blood pressure.
   Helm, a longshoreman's clerk who worked the docks in Oakland,
commuted 250 miles each weekend to visit his family in the small
town of Weaverville.
   His former wife, Lorrie Helm, and the couple's children were
frequently at his side during his hospitalization. She said he
acknowledged hearing his family read the cards and letters sent to
him by well wishers but couldn't speak because of the respirator.
   Helm's rescue had buoyed frustrated rescue workers, who had been
finding only corpses in the rubble of I-880.
   ``I'm sure this will hit a lot of people hard,'' Steve Whipple,
the state Department of Transportation worker who found Helm, said
after learning of his death.
   ``I was under the impression that he was going to make it,''
Whipple said by telephone from his home in Pittsburg. ``It was just
going to take a long while.
   ``I'm still glad we found him and gave him a better fighting
chance than he would have had otherwise,'' Whipple said. ``It
picked our spirits up and made all our work worth it.''
   The news also stunned residents of Weaverville, where signs
saying ``Good Luck Buck, We're With You'' remained in merchants'
windows.
   ``It's really depressing,'' said Trinity County Supervisor Dee
Potter. ``An awful lot of people have been praying for him.''
   ``We were talking about what to do when he comes home,'' Potter
said.
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately released.
   Helm's death came amid other signs of hope in the San Francisco
Bay area. Traffic flowed across the Oakland-San Francisco Bay
Bridge on Saturday, the first time motorists were able to cross the
span since the quake knocked out a 50-foot section.
   In the Santa Cruz area near the quake epicenter, a highway
linking the coastal city with Silicon Valley was reopened Sunday
after being closed for more than a month by earthquake-triggered
landslides.

<TEXT>
   Residents watching the cutting of a 90-foot
spruce selected as the U.S. Capitol's Christmas tree went scurrying
for cover when the falling tree twisted out of control and crashed
across a road.
   The giant spruce toppled onto a crane mounted on a logging truck
waiting to haul it away. Ten feet broke off the top when volunteers
tried to move it at the Kootenai National Forest in northwestern
Montana.
   A crowd of about 300 was on hand for the tree-cutting Saturday.
   Afterward, the woodcutters felled another tree down the road
deemed acceptable by the Capitol's landscape architect when he
visited the forest in June.
   ``We'd like to say it went perfect the first time, but it
didn't,'' said Bill Crismore of Libby, who had been given the honor
of cutting the tree.
   Only about 61 feet of the tree can be shipped to Washington
because that is the length of the enclosed rail car that will carry
it, he said. The 41-year-old Englelmann spruce will be erected on
the west front lawn of the Capitol.
   U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Jeannie Spooner said guy wires
were attached to the first tree to lower it, but the tension on the
wires apparently wasn't even.
   Spooner said the Montana tree is not the ``the nation's
Christmas tree.'' That distinction goes to a tree planted near the
White House in 1972 that the president lights each year.
   Montana is providing the Capitol tree because the state is
celebrating its centennial this year.

<HEAD>For Michigan Abortion Bill, Key Vote is Veto Override</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Fixes paragraphing in 1st two grafs.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Abortion foes expect to chalk up another
victory with a restrictive law in Michigan, but abortion rights
forces are banking on the Legislature's inability to override a
promised veto from Gov. James Blanchard.
   Both sides say there's no doubt a bill restricting abortions
will pass in the House next month as it did in the Senate in
October by a 29-8 vote.
   ``With such wide public support for a parental rights measure,
we fully expect our representatives to reflect the will of the
citizens of Michigan,'' said Barbara Listing, president of the
anti-abortion group, Michigan Right to Life, after the Senate
approval.
   But both sides also acknowledge that the Democrat-controlled
House can't muster enough votes to override a veto by the
Democratic governor, who has pledged to strike down any bill
restricting access to abortion.
   The bill pending in a House committee would require unmarried
girls under the age of 18 to get one parent's consent before
getting an abortion. As an alternative, they could also seek
permission from a probate judge who would have to determine if she
was mature enough to make the choice and if it was in her best
interests.
   A similar bill already has cleared the Republican-controlled
Senate, which has enough votes to override a veto. But a two-thirds
majority of the House's 109 members is also needed to override a
veto.
   The action in Michigan comes on the heels of the Pennsylvania
Legislature's decision to place tough restrictions on abortion.
Pennsylvania's bill, signed into law Friday, is the first since the
U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in July, upholding certain abortion
restrictions in Missouri.
   The Pennsylvania bill requires married women to notify husbands
about abortion plans; abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy
would be banned; and women would have to wait 24 hours after
learning of their pregnancy before getting an abortion.
   ``The anti-choice people are going to run around looking for as
many victories as they can without people realizing they are not
victories at all,'' said Rep. Maxine Berman, one of the pro-choice
leaders in the Michigan House.
   In Michigan, a vote in the House committee is scheduled for Dec.
4, and Speaker Lewis Dodak plans to hold a full House vote and send
the bill to the Senate before legislators go home for the holidays.
   Since the governor has two weeks to veto the measure, that
probably will push the veto override vote into early next year.
   The Legislature has overridden only one veto in the past 38
years, that coming in 1977 on an obscure administrative rules bill.
   Berman said the anti-abortion victory in Pennsylvania actually
might have helped the pro-choice side.
   ``Pennsylvania is known as one of the most Neanderthal states on
this issue,'' Berman said. ``This might hurt anti-choice forces
because it was so out of line, so reactionary and so punishing that
it opened up a lot of eyes on what these people are really up to.
   Margy Long, a spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood Affiliates of
Michigan, said victories by pro-choice candidates in Virginia and
New Jersey gubernatorial elections this month have sent a warning
signal to politicians elsewhere.
   ``It's going to be part of the election, you can just bet on
it,'' agreed Rep. Michael Griffin, a sponsor of the bill. ``It's
possible this may end up as a ballot issue.''
   A year ago, Michigan voters decided to ban state-funded
abortions for poor women, taking action via a referendum after two
decades of failures in the Legislature. Lawmakers tried 17 times to
end the funding, but Blanchard vetoed seven and his Republican
predecessor, Gov. William Milliken, struck down 10.

   A government committee suggested renaming
Luling's Old Spanish Trail ``Catfish Street,'' but the new name
didn't smell quite right to folks around here.
   ``You should have seen the faces drop when I announced it would
be Catfish Street,'' said Pastor Robert Zehr of the Mennonite
church established 53 years ago in this town nearly 15 miles west
of New Orleans.
   Zehr said his congregation was appalled at the prospect, even if
their street would be named for one of Louisiana's most famous
exports. Old Spanish Trail has a solid, dignified ring to it, and
the church is proud to have that address, the minister said.
   The committee has been working to eliminate a multitude of St.
Charles Parish streets with identical or similar names.
   There are seven First Streets around the parish, and Luling
alone has Oak Lane, Oak Place and Oak Avenue. Old Spanish Trail,
one of many roads around the state recalling the days of Spanish
rule, runs about eight miles from Boutte to Des Allemands.
   The committee has had other problems doing its job.
   In Luling, a street named for conquistador Hernando Cortez in
the Coronado Park subdivision had to be renamed because Des
Allemands has a Cortez Lane. The committee suggested Magellan to go
along with Balboa, Coronado and DeSoto.
   No good.
   ``We wanted to stay with the Spanish names,'' said Ken Riggin of
the Coronado Civic Association. ``Magellan was not actually
Spanish. He was contracted by the Spanish, but he was Portuguese.''
   The committee settled on Pizarro.

   The nation's No. 2 brewer, behind Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., is
using its muscle to test the brand in Seattle and western
Massachusetts.
   The test started earlier this year comes at a flat time in the
domestic beer market, with companies trying more experiments to
gain a bigger share.
   ``Miller really knows how to introduce new products,'' said
Robert Weinberg, a beer analyst and a professor of marketing
management at Washington University in St. Louis.
   According to industry estimates, Leinenkugel sold nearly 100,000
barrels last year, compared with national brands that sell in the
millions.
   ``If the Leinenkugel brand tickles people, either because of the
name or the taste, Miller could take it national overnight,''
Weinberg said.
   Jake Leinenkugel, who remained an executive at the brewery after
the buyout, said Miller is trying to take a low-key approach in
promoting the beer.
   ``We want to go in a little mysterious, a little quiet,''
Leinenkugel said. ``We don't want to go in with a heavy media
campaign. We want it to be discovered.''

   Up to 2 feet of snow fell on western New York state Sunday as
temperatures climbed to record highs in three Midwestern cities and
dropped to record lows in Ohio and West Virginia.
   Snow showers also fell over northwest Pennsylvania, eastern
Upper Michigan and northern Maine.
   In New York state, lake-effect storms left up to 2 feet of snow
in Lewis County, 21 inches in Highmarket, a foot in Boonville, 9
inches in Barnes Corners, 8 inches in Sinclairville and 6 inches in
Salamanca.
   Scattered rain fell on west central Texas and the upper Texas
coast, and from northwest Montana to Washington state.
   Strong winds blew over the Great Lakes. Gale warnings were posed
for lakes Erie, Huron and Ontario.
   Winds gusted to almost 70 mph in Livingston, Mont. A high-wind
warning was posted for the upper Yellowstone Valley of Montana.
   But in Goodland, Kan., the temperature was a balmy 74 degrees,
snapping the record for the date of 73 set in 1949. It was 71
degrees in Scottsbluff, Neb., where the old record of 70 had stood
since 1932. Sioux City, Iowa, tied its 1936 record of 68.
   By contrast, the mercury dipped to 17 degrees in Youngstown,
Ohio, 1 degree below the old record for the date set in 1966.
Low-temperatures records were also set in Parkersburg (19 degrees,

   The archbishop of San Salvador,
speaking at the funeral Mass for six slain Jesuit priests, said,
``these brutal murders place our country in the first place of
barbarity in the world.''
   Roman Catholic Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas said of the
massacre, ``There exists the vehement presumption that the murders
were committed by members of the armed forces or people in intimate
connivance with them.''
   About 800 mourners, many of them weeping, crowded the chapel at
Simeon Canas Central American University or stood outside listening
to the service broadcast over loudspeakers.
   The bodies of the priests were placed in a crypt in the chapel
at the university where they worked and where they were killed
early Thursday. Also slain were their cook, Elba Ramos and her
15-year-old daughter Celina. They were buried in a family tomb.
   President Alfredo Cristiani, who attended the funeral service at
the university auditorium, has promised that those responsible for
the massacre will be punished.
   Rivera Damas told reporters, ``We hold him (Cristiani) to his
word.''
   Others attending the funeral included Foreign Minister Jose
Manuel Pacas, U.S. Ambassador William Walker and the ambassadors of
Mexico, Spain and Costa Rica.
   The Rev. Jose Maria Tojeira, head of the Jesuit order in Central
America, said in a homily at the service, ``Love is stronger than
death. The colleagues and disciples of our deceased brothers will
always be at the side of the poor.''
   ``With this murder they have not killed the Society of Jesus.
They have not killed the Central American University,'' said
Tojeira, tears streaming down his face.
   In a message read at the Mass, Pope John Paul II expressed his
hope that ``the sacrifice of these priests becomes the seed of
fraternal love and an inspiration that we become each day more
complete artisans of peace.''
   Other priests reported two witnesses, who they declined to
identify, said they saw about 30 men in military uniforms enter the
house where the victims were sleeping before dawn Thursday _
shortly before the shooting began.
   The eight were roused from bed, shot and their brains removed as
a macabre message to intellectuals who advocate changes in
Salvadoran society to aid the poor.
   The six priests had been accused by the government-controlled
news media of sympathizing with the rebels.
   Militant members of Cristiani's Republican Nationalist Alliance,
or Arena, have frequently said liberal Catholic priests and
Protestant missionary workers are supporting the rebels who have
been waging war against U.S.-backed governments for more than 10
years.
   Attorney General Mauricio Colorado said Sunday that Rivera Damas
and a Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop should leave El Salvador for
their own safety. In a letter to the pope released Saturday,
Colorado accused ``certain bishops'' of fomenting violence and
asked they be withdrawn.
   The six priests were slain as guerrillas and troops battled
through the outskirts of San Salvador in an offensive the rebels
launched Nov. 11.
   Two of the victims were the university rector, Ignacio
Ellacuria, and Ignacio Martin-Baro, one of the region's polling
specialists.
   Rivera Damas has been an oustpoken advocate of a cease-fire and
truce in the war that has claimed more than 70,000 lives. The pope
also has appealed for a resumption of peace talks broken off
earlier this month.

   Tens of thousands of protesters in
at least eight cities braved icy winds Sunday to keep the heat on
the Communist leadership, despite open borders and the election of
a reform-minded Cabinet one day earlier.
   Nearly 3 million East Germans crossed into West Berlin and West
Germany between Friday and Sunday, the second weekend since the
government opened borders to the West, border police said. Most
were just visiting for the day.
   Ferry service across the Elbe River, which forms part of the
border, resumed Sunday at Hitzacker, about 80 miles southeast of
Hamburg, for the first time since April 23, 1945.
   In other changes, the official ADN news agency reported that the
roles of the party and the government in East Germany's armed
forces will be separated.
   Also Sunday, an opposition leader said his pro-democracy group
would hold a convention next month to establish itself as a formal
political party.
   Wolfgang Schnur, in an interview with West Germany's ARD
television network, said his Democratic Awakening opposition group
will meet Dec. 16-17 _ the same time the Communist Party will be
holding a special session in East Berlin to look at further
leadership changes.
   Communist chief Egon Krenz assured East Germans in a televised
interview late Sunday that he will fight for political reform. ``If
the party is of another opinion, then they should find another
general secretary,'' he said at his East Berlin home.
   ADN said 50,000 people participated in Dresden's first
officially authorized protest rally. Other estimates of the crowd
size ranged up to 100,000.
   ``Lord don't forgive them because they knew what they did,''
said one banner in the southern city, making a biting play on words
from Jesus Christ's agony on the cross.
   In East Berlin, thousands participated in an unauthorized march
from the Alexanderplatz square to Parliament, calling for sweeping
reforms and abolition of the Communist Party's guaranteed monopoly
on power.
   Parliament on Saturday confirmed a reform-minded Cabinet of
Communist Premier Hans Modrow and created a committee to study
possible constitutional changes, including dropping a law
guaranteeing Communist rule.
   ``We won't let ourselves be blinded by the open borders,'' said
one protest banner. ``Swap DDR (East Germany) for Mickey Mouse,''
said another.
   One sign suggested, ``Honecker to court,'' and speakers called
for prosecution of the country's former leaders, including ousted
president and party chief Erich Honecker, who was replaced by Krenz
Oct. 18.
   Krenz was quoted by a West German newspaper as saying Honecker
is one of those under investigation by a parliamentary commission.
   Just outside the capital, about 30,000 Communist Party backers
demonstrated in Potsdam to show their support for the government's
announced reform program, ADN said.
   ADN reported other pro-democracy rallies Sunday in a half-dozen
cities and towns: 20,000 people in Erfurt, 10,000 in Meiningen,
also 10,000 in Frankfurt an der Oder, 3,000 in Schwedt and 2,000 in
Neustrelitz. The official agency said ``thousands'' protested in
Karl Marx Stadt but did not give a more precise crowd estimate for
the march there or in East Berlin.
   At least some demonstrators were cool to the idea of unifying
the two Germanys, a subject of much debate since East German
borders opened Nov. 9.
   ``Reunification now _ No Thanks,'' read one of the banners at
the Dresden march. ``We are not on the Reeperbahn where you can buy
a union for money,'' it added, referring to the famous red-light
district in Hamburg, West Germany.
   The demonstrators marched a two-mile route to a rally at
Dresden's Theater Square.
   Joining the marchers on the sidewalk was Andreas Leber, a
40-year-old Lutheran pastor at the cathedral in nearby Meissen.
   With one hand he held a pram carrying his baby son and with the
other a cardboard sign saying ``Our people need the Communist Party
like a fish needs a bicycle.'' He drew much laughter.
   ``Meissen was left intact in World War II,'' he told a reporter.
``But 40 years of socialism has left one third of the city
derelict.''
   In another reform measure, ADN said Sunday that the roles of the
Communist Party and the government in running the army ``will be
clearly separated from now on.''
   The Political Directorate of the 173,000-strong National
People's Army proposed that guidelines setting out the party's grip
on the army be suspended and that ``secretariats of the political
organs'' in the army command be dissolved, ADN said.
   The dispatch gave no further details, but it appeared clear East
Germany is following a Soviet lead in moves toward a
less-politicized army.

<UNK>Marxist Wins Final Spot in Brazil's Presidential Runoff ^By JORGE
MEDEROS ^Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marxist Luis Inacio Lula da Silva edged
out a leftist rival Sunday to run against a conservative candidate
in December's presidential election runoff.
   The Superior Electoral Court said with 97 percent of the ballots
counted da Silva, of the socialist Workers Party, was in second
place with 11.3 million votes, for 16.1 percent, while left-wing
populist Leonel Brizola had 11.1 million votes, for 15.7 percent.
   The two candidates had been very close in slow vote counting
from Wednesday's election. It was evident several days ago that
rightist Fernando Collor de Mello had finished first among the 21
candidates.
   The returns gave Collor de Mello 19.8 million votes _ 28 percent
of the ballots cast in the election, the country's first direct
presidential vote since 1960.
   As no candidate received a majority, da Silva and Collor de
Mello will face each other in a runoff scheduled for Dec. 17.
   The electoral court president, Jose Francisco Rezek, said final
ballots wold be counted Monday and an official announcement would
only be made Nov. 27. He said, however, it was ``mathmatically
impossible'' for Brizola to overtake da Silva.
   Brizola, of the Democratic Labor Party, refused to concede.
   Supporters of da Silva, popularly known as Lula, staged victory
rallies in several cities Sunday.
   Da Silva had no comment late Sunday but his party's president,
Luis Gushiken, promised to ``unmask Collor de Mello in the second
round and show the people what he is _ a member of the elite that
opposes needed social change.''
   Collor de Mello said ``the Worker's Party ideological rigidity,
will give us a huge victory in December.''
   Brizola said he would ask for votes in some regions to be
rechecked.
   Da Silva was in third throughout counting Saturday but surged
Sunday afternoon when votes from Minas Gerais and the impoverished
northeast rolled in.
   In Sao Paulo, 1,000 da Silva supporters jammed Avenida Paulista,
one of the city's major thoroughfares, and danced, embraced and
sang the Workers Party anthem.
   In Rio, da Silva's backers paraded through the wealthy South
Zone, honked horns, waved huge red party flags, and piled into bars
to make victory toasts.
   Brizola has almost fanatical support in Rio, where he received
over 50 percent of the vote, and Globo, Brazil's largest television
network, showed film footage of the candidate's backers weeping at
party headquarters as election returns confirmed da Silva's victory.

<HEAD>Gasoline in Heater May Have Sparked Fire That Killed Nine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAXTON, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline may have been poured inadvertently
into a kerosene heater just before it exploded inside a mobile
home, killing a woman, her five children and their three young
cousins, a rescue official said Sunday.
   ``They're really not sure yet,'' said Randy McArthur, commander
of the Maxton Rescue Squad. He said investigators were currently
focusing on that as a possible cause.
   Killed in the 3:30 a.m. blaze Saturday were Lois Ann Hunt, 32,
and her five children: Alisha, 12, Melissa, 11, Larry, 5, Bobby
Ray, 3, and Nikki, 2. Three other children staying in Mrs. Hunt's
trailer located about four miles north of Maxton in rural Robeson
County also died: Crystal Lynn Locklear, 5; Glenford Locklear, 4;
and Daniel Locklear, 2.
   Their mother, JoAnn Locklear, 25, of Maxton, is Mrs. Hunt's
niece. She and her companion, Richard Eugene Tyndall, 22, of
Laurinburg escaped the fire with minor injuries.
   The 11 people were sleeping in the 60-foot-long, three-bedroom
mobile home when neighbors reported being awakened by an explosion,
and saw the trailer engulfed in intense flames within three minutes.
   ``It sounded like a shotgun going off,'' said Anthony Locklear,
38, who lives across the street and is not related to JoAnn
Locklear. ``By the time I got out of the house, it was just
blazing.''
   Mrs. Locklear and Tyndall broke a bedroom window and climbed
out. A frantic Locklear tried to reenter the mobile home, screaming
``Save my babies! Somebody save my babies!'' said the neighbor.
   ``All the children. The children. I just can't take it,'' said
Doc Locklear Jr., 44, Mrs. Hunt's brother. ``I'm just lost. I don't
know what to say.''
   At about 3 a.m., Mrs. Hunt told her oldest daughter, Alisha, to
``make sure the kerosene heater doesn't go out,'' Tyndall told
Anthony Locklear. The child apparently got out of bed to refill the
heater with kerosene.
   Investigators said Alisha mistakenly might have put gasoline in
the heater. Another possibility is that a spark from the unit
touched off a propane tank Hunt used for cooking, officials said.
   Hunt supported her five children by working as a cook at a
nearby Hardee's. She had been estranged from her husband, Robert,
for more than a year, Evelyn Porter, a neighbor and friend, told
The Charlotte Observer.
   ``She lived for her children, they were her pride and joy,''
said Brenda Bullard, Hunt's friend and neighbor. ``She worked hard
for those kids.''
   Another brother of Mrs. Hunt, Kermit Locklear, drove up to the
trailer Saturday afternoon. He climbed atop the metal carcass and
reached into the charred bedroom dresser. With trembling hands, he
began pulling out singed pieces of children's clothing.
   Fighting back tears, he continued the search.
   ``Here they are,'' he said.
   Locklear had found pictures of his sister's five children, taken
last Christmas. He began handing them to his children.
   ``Don't you lose these now, you hear?'' he told them. ``That's
all we have left.''

   About 30,000 demonstrators Sunday
denounced police brutality and demanded that the government and top
Communist officials resign. Authorities arrested 10 dissidents but
left the marchers alone.
   The government denied reports that police killed a student in
bloody clashes Friday, when hundreds were beaten, tear-gassed and
attacked by dogs in the largest demonstration in 20 years.
   Sunday's rally began with a few thousand protesters gathering on
downtown Wenceslas Square, but the crowd grew to 30,000 as
demonstrators reached Narodini Street, where white-helmeted riot
police beat demonstrators Friday.
   ``We don't let you murder us!'' the crowd chanted. They also
chanted such slogans as ``Write Truthfully,'' ``Free Unions'' and
``Jakes to the dustbin.''
   Milos Jakes is the hard-line leader of the ruling Communist
Party and, unlike most East bloc leaders, has resisted reforms
orchestrated by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   About 2,000 demonstrators split away and crossed a bridge over
the Vltava river in an apparent attempt to reach the hillside
presidential residence.
   Police did not interfere in the march but did block access to
the hill.
   Those arrested included Petr Uhl, a leading human rights
activist, who was charged in connection with the spreading of news
about the alleged death of Martin Smid at police hands Friday. The
state news agency CTK said he was charged with ``the crimes of
harming the interests of the republic abroad and spreading alarming
news.''
   Uhl, a veteran member of the Charter 77 human rights group, is
associated with VIA, a dissident news service active in several
East European countries. If convicted, he could be sentenced to 3{
years in prison.
   Dissident sources in Prague and Vienna told The Associated Press
that police also arrested Drahomira Drazska, who said she was
Smid's girlfriend. She claimed he was killed by special police
Friday.
   Some prominent dissidents such as Hana Marvanova of the
Independent Peace Association, Emanuel Mandler of the Democratic
Initiative and Anna Sabatova, a senior member of Charter 77, also
were arrested, the sources said.
   On Sunday night, about 300 people from a dozen political groups
met, formed an organization called the Civil Forum and adopted a
resolution that demands the resignation of Communist Party
Politburo members ``responsible for the 1968 invasion,'' including
President Gustav Husak and Jakes. The Soviet-led invasion in August
1968 crushed a liberal Communist government.
   The resolution also calls for the removal of officials
responsible for suppressing Friday's demonstration, establishes a
commission to investigate police brutality and demands the release
of all ``prisoners of conscience.''
   It said if the demands are not met the Civil Forum will back a
two-hour general strike Nov. 27. A representative of a student
group told the meeting students would begin sit-in strikes at
several universities Monday.
   Among those attending the meeting were representatives of the
Socialist Party and People's Party, both allied with the Communists.
   Protests also took place in at least eight East German cities
Sunday and in the Bulgarian capital, Sofia. As in Prague, the
demonstrators demanded democratic reforms but also punishment of
recently ousted leaders _ Todor Zhivkov in Bulgaria and Erich
Honecker in East Germany.
   Plainclothes police in Prague prevented several reporters from
attending a scheduled news conference on the Smid case in the home
of Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova.
   According to dissident sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity, police picked up some of the arrested people as they
left or sought to enter Nemcova's apartment.
   The Washington Post reported Sunday that a 20-year-old man named
Martin Smid died after being beaten by two police near Wenceslas
Square Friday. Police notified his parents that he had died in an
accident, according to the newspaper, which quoted friends and
witnesses it did not name.
   ``The information we have so far indicates that it was an
unfounded rumor,'' government spokesman Miroslav Pavel said.
   Informed unofficial sources said there may be three people named
Martin Smid in Prague, so the identity of the alleged victim was
difficult to determine. Authorities spoke only of two Martin Smids.
   State television on Sunday showed the two, both identified as
students of mathematics at Prague's Charles University.
   The first one was said to be from the town of Beroun near
Prague. The other was identified as a Prague resident, who said ``I
was shaken'' when told of the report he was dead.
   The first Martin Smid said he did not take part in the protest,
while the other said he did. The broadcast said he would be allowed
to continue his studies.
   More than 30,000 students marched Friday for five hours to
commemorate student Jan Opletal, killed by the Nazis 50 years ago.
When demonstrators tried to reach Wenceslas Square, police attacked
them with tear gas and clubs.
   Hospital officials said more than 100 people required treatment.
Police said more than 140 people were taken to police stations.
   Charter 77 likened the police crackdown to Nazi reprisals during
World War II.
   It was the largest demonstration in Czechoslvakia since August
1969, when crowds gathered in downtown Prague a year after the
Soviet-led invasion.

   Romanian leaders turned back
reporters planning to cover the Communist Party Congress and
restricted tourist travel to and from the country, news reports and
journalists said Sunday.
   The political platform adopted ahead of the 14th Congress of the
Romanian Communist Party calls for an ``intensified ideological
struggle and the encouragement of all anti-imperialist and
revolutionary forces in the world,'' according to Yugoslavia's
official Tanjug news agency.
   However, Hungary's ruling Socialist Party on Sunday urged
Romania to join other East bloc countries and make democratic
reforms. The Hungarian party, which changed its name from the
Communist Party in one of a series of reforms earlier this year,
said it would not send a representative to the congress, the
official Hungarian news agency MTI said.
   The French news agency AFP's Vienna chief of bureau, Jean
Burner, was declared unwelcome by Romanian authorities and barred
from the country, AFP said.
   For Burner, who has headed AFP's Vienna bureau since August, it
would have been his first official trip to Romania. Another French
journalist was denied entry Thursday.
   A Yugoslav journalist critical of Romanian leader Nicolae
Ceausescu said he also was refused permission to enter that country
to report on the congress, which begins Monday.
   Dragoslav Markovic, a former correspondent of Yugoslavia's state
Tanjug news agency from Bucharest, was proclaimed persona non grata
by the Romanian foreign ministry, he told The Associated Press.
   The application for Markovic's accreditation was rejected with
the explanation that Markovic was unwelcome in Romania in any
capacity, even as a tourist, he said.
   Romania, under Ceausescu's hard-line rule since 1964, is the
East bloc country most opposed to any significant political reform.
Ceausescu even urged his Warsaw Pact allies to intervene to block
Solidarity's takeover in Poland.
   ``To renounce ideological opposition to capitalism means to
abandon class struggle in the name of peace, which is impossible as
long as there are two opposed systems, capitalism and socialism,''
Tanjug quoted the party's political platform as saying.
   The government Saturday severely restricted travel to and from
Romania and stepped up security measures inside the country,
Hungarian and Yugoslav media reported.
   In a report from Bucharest, the official East German news agency
ADN said official East German travelers who wanted to fly to
Bucharest with the Romanian TAROM airline were not allowed to.
   ADN also said Romanian border police for several hours held up

   Travel restrictions appeared to have slackened somewhat Sunday.
Between 6 a.m. and 11 a.m. Sunday, 870 people sought to cross from
Hungary into Romania; 88 were turned back, said a senior Hungarian

<HEAD>Hard Work Pushes Up Taxes For Owner of `First Thanksgiving' Plantation</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The elderly owner of a 17th-century
plantation said to be the site of the first Thanksgiving is trying
to save it from being sold off in parts because of onerous
inheritance taxes.
   ``I feel like we're caretakers of the place for the public,''
said Malcolm Jamieson, who has spent much of his life restoring
Berkeley Plantation's bare grounds and its manor to their original
splendor.
   The plantation, which sits along the James River between
Richmond and Williamsburg, has a rich history.
   The first Thanksgiving in the Colonies was celebrated at
Berkeley on Dec. 4, 1619, more than a year before the Pilgrims had
their better-known Thanksgiving dinner in what is now Plymouth,
Mass., according to ``The Great Plantation'' by Virginia historian
Clifford Dowdey.
   The mansion was built in 1726. William Henry Harrison, the ninth
president of the United States, was born there. George Washington
and the nine presidents who followed him dined at Berkeley.
   The first bourbon was distilled at the plantation, ``Taps'' was
composed there, and President Lincoln reviewed troops there during
the Civil War, according to ``The Great Plantation.''
   ``The tourists are saving it,'' Jamieson said. ``If it weren't
for the tourists, we couldn't keep these places on (our) outside
income.''
   Jamieson estimated that 50,000 people visit Berkeley annually.
Adults pay a $7 admission fee and children pay $3.50.
   Jamieson said the money from tourists may not be enough when he
dies. He estimated inheritance taxes on the house and a little more
than 1,000 acres at nearly $1 million.
   Jamieson, who gives his age as over 80, said that after years of
research he has not found a way around the tax problem.
   He already has prepared building sites in the woods should his
son need to sell part of the land. He said he has been offered
$100,000 for four acres along the James River.
   ``There's too much American history here to cut it up,'' said
Jamieson, who feels that inheritance taxes should be deferred for
properties like Berkeley that are open to the public and are on the
National Register of Historic Landmarks.
   The idea is an old one but a good one, said Carl Nelson,
spokesman for the National Trust for Historic Preservation in
Washington.
   ``It's an idea that really needs to be looked at closely,'' he
said.
   The six-month property tax bill, about $600 in 1926 when
Jamieson inherited part of the plantation and bought the rest from
his relatives, has grown to about $16,000, Jamieson said.
   Jamieson's father, John, bought the house and surrounding acres
in 1905. The Jamiesons opened the house to the public in 1938.
   Admissions money is used to maintain the house and grounds. The
Jamiesons live from revenue from the farm and nursery on the
property. Jamieson, his son, Jamie, and six others run the farm and
act as guides.
   Jamieson has planted trees and shrubbery, and restored the
original five terraces leading down to the river. He and his son
grow boxwoods, which they sell Busch Gardens amusement park, pricey
developments on the James River near Williamsburg and others.
   The hard work has pushed up the value of his property, which
today has an estimated worth of $2 million to $3 million, according
to Jamieson.
   Jamieson said he has asked U.S. Rep Herbert Bateman, R-Va., for
help with his proposal for deferred estate taxes.
   Bateman said he is drafting legislation to address Jamieson's
concerns.
   ``I think he has a very legitimate concern,'' Bateman said. ``I
am sympathetic. ... The tradeoff is better assurance that historic
properties at the death of the owner remain open and available to
the public as historic properties they can see and touch and
experience.''

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas withdrew
from most areas they had seized around San Salvador Sunday, winding
down their biggest offensive of the civil war and pulling back to
their mountain strongholds.
   Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas warned that ``a dreadful wave of
revenge, repression and witch hunting may follow'' may follow the
guerrilla withdrawal. The attorney general said Rivera Damas and a
Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop should leave El Salvador for their
own safety.
   About 800 mourners attended the burial of six Jesuit priests and
two others who were slain and mutilated early Thursday at their
residence at Jose Simeon Canas Central American University.
   The United States has pressed rightist President Alfredo
Cristiani for a full investigation of the killings. In Washington,
Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., warned Sunday that U.S. aid to El
Salvador could be curtailed if Cristiani cannot control right-wing
death squads from operating in the country.
   There was virtually no gunfire in the capital as troops regained
control of the working-class districts of Zacamil and Metropolis on
the north side and Mejicanos in the northeast.
   The guerrillas, however, retained their grip on parts of
Soyapango, a working class suburb to the east of the capital, and
soldiers said there had been fighting throughout the day. Four
helicopter gunships were rocketing the area at dusk.
   Around the capital, army patrols moved through the shattered
streets, strewn with the rubble of fighting. On some streets,
several burned bodies could be seen.
   Later Sunday, security troops raided a small church in the
capital haboring refugees from the fighting.
   A military news release gave a tentative count of nearly 1,000
soldiers and guerrillas killed since the rebels launched their
nationwide offensive Nov. 11.
   The military said 784 guerrillas were killed, 527 wounded and
129 captured and government forces lost 208 killed and 627 wounded.
   Radio Venceremos, the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front's clandestine radio station, claimed 827 soldiers were killed
or wounded but gave no breakdown.
   Neither side gave an estimate of casualties among civilians, who
suffered heavily in the block-by-block fighting. The Red Cross said
an estimate was difficult because many bodies are still in the
streets.
   About 800 mourners gathered for the burial of six Jesuit
priests, their cook and her teen-age daughter, who were slain
Thursday and their bodies mutilated. Cristiani and U.S. Ambassador
William Walker was among those who attended the funeral Mass.
   Rivera Damas said before the service that ``there exists the
vehement presumption that the murders were committed by members of
the armed forces or people in intimate connivance with them.''
   Later, in his regular Sunday homily, Rivera Damas called the
rebel offensive ``useless and unjustifiable'' and said the military
response was ``excessive.''
   He said with the guerrilla withdrawal ``a dreadful wave of
revenge, repression and witch hunting may follow.''
   Rivera Damas was asked about a letter sent by Attorney General
Mauricio Colorado to Pope John Paul II asking that some bishops be
removed from El Salvador for their own safety. Colorado claimed the
bishops were fomenting violence.
   The archbishop said he did not have the text of the letter,
which was published by Sunday newspapers, but added, ``Certainly, I
have received some terse threats.''
   Colorado said he sent the letter as a private citizen. He
mentioned no names in the letter but told reporters Sunday that he
was referring to Rivera Damas and auxiliary bishop Gregorio Rosa
Chavez. Colorado claimed he had information ``confirming there is a
plan to attempt against (the lives) of these church dignataries.''
   They could be assassinated by any ``resentful person,'' Colorado
said.
   ``Monsignor Rosa Chavez has participated, even his brothers are
part of the guerrillas, which is known by everyone and Monsignor
Rivera Damas have expressed some controversial and very
objectionable opinions ... and this places them at gave risk,'' he
added.
   Members of Cristiani's right-wing Republican Nationalist
Alliance have frequently criticized Jesuit priests as being
sympathetic to the rebels.
   At the Vatican, the pope told thousands of people in St. Peter's
Square that the world was viewing ``with profound apprehension the
tragic events'' in El Salvador.
   He said the Jesuit priests ``were barbarically assassinated''
and that many other innocent people were killed in the
``fratricidal fighting.'' He made no mention of Colorado's appeal.
   In San Salvador, many pharmacies and food stores were open for
the first time in a week. They were crowded by customers, many of
whom had been trapped in their homes and neighborhoods during the
fighting.
   An estimated 40,000 people in San Salvador's population of 1
million fled the battle zones during the offensive.
   Many occupied soccer stadiums, schools and Red Cross and church
shelters with little food or water.
   As they returned to damaged or destroyed homes they poked
through the ruins for possessions, trying to ignore bodies lying
nearby.
   In Mejicanos, a man searched through his damaged home, his
burned car parked nearby.
   ``This is over now,'' he said. ``The guerrillas came, and then
the army came and they shot from helicopters and look at what they
did!'' He declined to give his name, fearing reprisal.

<HEAD>Newspaper: U.S.-Saudi Arabia Will Fund CIA Covert Aid to Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Saudi Arabia have
agreed to provide $715 million to fund covert aid from the CIA to
rebels trying to topple Afghanistan's Soviet-backed regime, the Los
Angeles Times reported Sunday.
   The money will supply mujahedeen guerrillas battling the Kabul
government with military equipment and supplies during the next
three months, the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources.
   The assistance is intended to nearly match the Soviet Union's
aid to the government of Afghan President Najibullah, which U.S.
intelligence estimated at $250 million a month.
   The Bush administration has already received congressional
approval for $280 million in U.S. aid to the rebels through
February, and the sources said the rest of the funds will come from
Saudi Arabia.
   The aid is reportedly intended as a message to Moscow in advance
of the December summit in Malta. Administration sources have
indicated the civil war in Afghanistan and other regional conflicts
will have a high priority at Malta.
   The sources said that in addition to Soviet assistance to
Afghanistan, the Soviets and the Cubans have provided new aid to
Nicaragua's Sandinista government, both directly and indirectly.
The Sandinistas, in turn, have aided leftist rebels in El Salvador,
where civil war erupted again this month.
   ``Whatever is happening inside the Soviet Union or Eastern
Europe, they (the Soviets) are not lowering their profile in
regional conflicts,'' said a source described as close to the
issue. ``The administration feels it has to be in a position to
keep up the pressure.''

<HEAD>Opposition Holds Campaign Rally with Foreign Observers Present</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NANDAIME, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 3,000 people attended an
opposition campaign rally along with about two dozen foreign
observers who had been invited to help ensure the peace.
   It was the first anti-Sandinista demonstration in Nandaime, 40
miles southeast of Managua, since clashes with government
supporters in July 1988 left scores wounded and arrested.
   Last year's violence led to the expulsion of the U.S.
ambassador, who the Sandinistas accused of inciting violence to
destabilize the government.
   The 14-party National Opposition Union even asked diplomats to
attend Sunday's rally because it feared violence from
pro-Sandinista groups, one European diplomat told The Associated
Press.
   It was the largest number of foreign observers at an opposition
rally since the election campaign began three months ago. A U.N.
observer group had nine observers, the Organization of American
States sent seven and there were diplomats from the Swedish,
British, U.S. and French embassies along with representatives of
foreign non-partisan organizations.
   Some of the observers met Saturday with the Nandaime mayor. One
source, speaking with the condition of anonymity, said the U.N. and
OAS representatives persuaded the mayor to cancel ``cleaning
projects'' Sunday that would have blocked streets along the
opposition's march route.
   The Opposition Union's presidential candidate, Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro, told the crowd to ``have faith.''
   ``The entire world is paying attention to all that is happening
in Nicaragua,'' she said.
   Mrs. Chamorro, whose family owns the opposition newspaper La
Prensa, is challenging President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista
National Liberation Front in the Feb. 25 elections.
   Opposition Union leaders accused Sandinistas of harassment
during the past week in Nandaime.
   They said their pro-Sandinista mobs stoned the houses of
opposition supporters, workers were threatened with being fired if
they went to the rally and truck and bus drivers were told their
licenses could be taken away if they didn't attend a meeting also
set for Sunday.
   At the July 10, 1988, rally in Nandaime by an anti-Sandinista
coalition, 40 opposition leaders were arrested following street
clashes. They served from three months to six months in prison.
   The following day U.S. Ambassador Richard Melton and seven other
American diplomats were expelled. The United States retaliated by
expelling the Nicaraguan ambassador in Washington and seven
Nicaraguan diplomats.
   Neither country has allowed the other to replace the diplomats.

   East German Communist Party chief Egon Krenz
opened his new home to state television Sunday, giving an interview
after his family's breakfast.
   It was an unprecedented action by an East German leader to
improve his and the party's image.
   In the interview broadcast Sunday night, Krenz said it was
possible he would be removed as party leader at the special party
congress next month.
   ``It is a decision of my party and I've always respected the
decisions of my party,'' Krenz said. ``Naturally, I want to fight
for the changes we've managed so far. But if the party is of
another opinion, then they should find another general secretary.''
   The congress is to be held Dec. 15-17.
   Krenz said the party's main problem was that ``for 40 years it
had not been able to pull itself away from Stalinism.''
   ``There will be no going back to the old conditions,'' he added.
   Krenz, 52, said the Communist Party is moving away from an
exclusive housing complex that had been reserved for top
functionaries.
   The television showed Krenz's ground-floor, brown concrete home
with a small garden in the Pankow district.
   Krenz said he had moved into the ``quiet East Berlin street''
after assuming the party leadership from hard-liner Erich Honecker
on Oct. 18.
   He said other members of the party's ruling Politburo were
moving out of the exclusive Wandlitz complex.
   Abolition of privileges for party officials has been a frequent
demand of East German demonstrators.
   Krenz's wife was visible in one scene but her name was not given.
   During the half-hour interview Krenz said East Germany's border
would remain open. ``This is the best proof of our sincerity about
reforms.''
   Krenz repeated his willingness to expand relations with West
Germany, but said East Germany will not become a colony of the West
or the source of cheap labor.

   Former U.S. Sen. Margaret Chase Smith of Maine
remained in intensive care Sunday but was improving steadily, four
days after she was hospitalized for chest pains, hospital officials
said.
   Mrs. Smith, 91, was listed in fair condition at Resurrection
Hospital.
   Ruth Pease, a friend who was with Mrs. Smith at the hospital,
gave no indication when the former Republican legislator from
Skowhegan, Maine, might be released.
   Mrs. Smith fell ill Wednesday during a flight from Bangor,
Maine, to Chicago while on her way to a meeting Indianapolis, said
her attorney and spokesman, Merton G. Henry.
   Henry said Mrs. Smith appeared to be suffering indigestion, but
the hospital ran tests to determine whether she was suffering heart
problems.
   Mrs. Smith represented Maine in Congress from 1932 to 1948, when
she was elected to the Senate. She was a senator until 1972.
   She was the first woman to serve in both houses of Congress, and
the first woman to have her name placed in nomination for the
presidency by a major party.

   Fletcher, 64, was taken to St. Elizabeth Medical Center

   Fletcher, a diabetic who also suffered a heart attack in 1983,
underwent triple-bypass heart surgery last week.
   The spokeswoman, who refused to give her name, said she did not

   Fletcher has not been nominated to head the Civil Rights
Commission but has said he expects to be Bush's choice when a

   He was assistant secretary of labor under President Nixon,
deputy assistant for urban affairs under President Ford and an
adviser to President Reagan.

<TEXT>
   Shipyard workers have removed 1,600 tons of
steel from the ruptured Exxon Valdez and plan to install new plates
to the hull of the tanker responsible for the nation's worst oil
spill, officials said.
   ``I don't think anybody has ever seen any damage like this
before,'' said Mike Blouin, a worker at the National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co., where the Exxon Valdez has been undergoing
repairs for the past three months.
   The ship spewed more than 11 million gallons of crude oil into
Alaska's Prince William Sound when it ran aground March 24.
   In the past seven weeks, NASSCO workers stripped huge steel
plates from the bottom center section of the hull, creating a
650-foot tunnel in the 987-foot ship.
   Each of the 3-4-inch thick steel sheets are about 44 feet wide
and 16 feet long and weigh about 100 tons. Many were twisted and
contorted in the collision, and workers found at least three big
rocks embedded into ripped sections of the hull.
   Workers removed the damaged plates by cutting the steel sections
free, allowing them to drop onto flatbed transport trucks parked
under the ship.
   The repairs are being done as the tanker rests on blocks about
three feet above the dry dock floor.
   Workers will begin the tedious task of replacing the steel
plates on Tuesday, NASSCO officials said.
   After the center section has been repaired, workers will begin
removing and replacing another 900 tons of steel on the right side
of the ship's hull, said Dennis Krumweide, manager of NASSCO's
structural engineering department.
   Another 800 tons of steel from other parts of the ship also will
have to be removed and replaced, Krumweide added.
   About 300 NASSCO employees will be working on the $30 million
repair project and Krumweide said it would ``be a piece of cake''
rebuilding the Valdez by the beginning of July.
   NASSCO workers built the Valdez between 1985 and 1986. It weighs
30,000 tons and can hold 16 million gallons of oil.
   Critics of the crippled tanker have said that the oil spill
could have been prevented if it had a double hull, but NASSCO
officials said Exxon did not request a double hull in the original
design or repair orders.
   The Valdez was towed 2,500 miles from Alaska to San Diego for
repairs, arriving off the San Diego coast on July 10.

   Nearly 480,000 candidates are running.
   On the eve of the elections, the Vietnam News Agency said that
public criticism had led to a number of candidates being
disqualified from the elections.
   Although Vietnam has made some major attempts to reform and
liberalize its economy, Hanoi's leaders insist the Communist Party

   The electorate has been given more choice among candidates,
although no opposition parties are permitted.

   Boeing Co. and Machinists union negotiators,
spurred by an unusual move by a federal mediator, agreed to a
tentative contract Sunday that could end the 47-day-old strike by
thousands of workers in nine states.
   After 14 hours of talks that ended about 3:30 a.m., chief Boeing
negotiator Larry McKean said the production workers could be back
on the job as early as Wednesday at the world's No. 1 maker of
passenger jets.
   ``At this point we're looking forward to a favorable vote on
this contract and a return to normal operations,'' he said.
   ``This proposal is a substantial improvement'' over previous
offers, said Tom Baker, president of Seattle-area District Lodge
751, which represents nearly four-fifths of the Boeing workers
covered by the Machinists contract.
   ``I feel it will be ratified overwhelmingly,'' he said. Despite
repeated assertions by Boeing officials that there would be no
increase in the company's pre-strike financial offer, Baker said,
``There is more money on the table.''
   He would give few specifics of the new offer, but said it
improved pay, medical coverage, overtime requirements and the
promotional system.
   Negotiators for the union were divided, saying arguments for and
against ratification would be presented when members meet to vote
on the three-year pact Monday. But most negotiators are
recommending acceptance, Baker said.
   ``I'm pretty sure everybody will go for it. We're tired of
standing around in the rain,'' Elaine Campbell, one of those
picketing in a steady rain outside a Boeing jet plant in the
Seattle suburb of Renton, Wash.
   ``There's a lot of people out there hurting,'' said another
picket, Steve Bogdun said. ``I don't think any of us are looking to
get rich. We're just looking for the old fair share of the pie.''
   The strike, which began Oct. 4, brought production at Boeing to
a virtual halt, delaying deliveries to airlines worldwide amid
rising concern over aging passenger jets.
   Mediator Doug Hammond said he proposed the deal a few hours
after talks resumed Saturday for the first time in two weeks. He
said submitting his own recommendation, rather than helping the two
sides toward a settlement, was ``an unusual and for me a rare
step.''
   He said he had used that tactic only once before in his 15 years
with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
   Baker and McKean praised Hammond's action.
   ``The parties were far apart on the issues, and I guess what it
took was some bold steps on the part of the mediator to bring the
parties together,'' Baker said.
   ``I believe that because of the meetings that we've had _ we
were kind of at loggerheads, I would say _ it was good and
professional for him to step in and give both parties a hand,''
McKean said.
   Justin Ostro, an international union vice president who is in
charge of aerospace industry negotiations for the Machinists,
attacked both the agreement and the mediator's role.
   ``This was a 3-to-2 vote (by the union negotiating team) on the
proposal tonight, and I would have to share _ since I am not a
voting member _ the opinion of the two,'' Ostro said.
   ``The mediator, I think, breached his responsibility for
neutrality,'' he added. ``He proposed an offer at 4 p.m. today
(Saturday) without the opportunity of negotiating or changing or
amending that offer, and it failed to address the workers' major
issues, which were general wage increases.''
   In contracts in 1983 and 1986, the Machinists accepted annual
productivity bonuses instead of wage increases. This year, with
Boeing riding years of record profits and orders for jets
stretching into the late 1990s, wage gains were a top union
priority.
   The Machinists represent 43,300 workers in the Seattle area;
12,000 in Wichita, Kan.; 1,700 in Portland, Ore., and a few hundred
others at scattered sites in California, Hawaii, Utah, Wyoming,
Montana, North Dakota and other states. Kansas, however, is a
right-to-work state, and 3,500 to 4,000 of the Boeing workers there
do not belong to the union.
   Probably more than 50,000 workers were on strike, but the
precise number was not known because some union members crossed
picket lines and some non-members stayed out.
   Paul Nisbet, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities in New
York, said earlier that he thought both sides probably felt
increasing pressure to settle.
   The pressure could have come from government agencies worried
about the inflationary effects of high wage demands, the fallout
from the strike on military contractors around the country, and the
effects on the nation's trade balance from a halt in production at
such a major exporter, Nisbet said.

<HEAD>Minister: East Germany Wishing To Improve Ties With israel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's foreign minister was quoted as
saying in an interview published Sunday that his country wants to
improve ties with Israel and may discuss reparations to Nazi
victims.
   ``It is obvious that we want an improvement,'' the daily Haaretz
quoted the official, Oskar Fischer, as saying. He added that East
Germany intended ``to deal with the subject and advance it.'' He
did not elaborate.
   Israel has never had formal contacts with East Germany because
of its denial of responsibility for the Nazi Germany's crimes. Six
million Jews were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust during in World
War II.
   Israel signed a reparations accord with West Germany in 1956 and
established diplomatic relations with that country in 1965.
   Referring to the reparations issue, Fischer said: ``This is, of
course, one of the subjects that we would have to discuss. But this
is not an issue for newspaper statements.''
   Fischer's statements to Haaretz were also carried by the
official East German news agency, ADN.
   On the prospect of German reunification, which has raised fears
and bitter memories in Israel, Fischer was quoted as saying:
   ``The Israelis should not be worried. Reunification of Germany
will never happen.''
   ``The two German countries may come closer to each other, and we
are interested in that, of course,'' Fischer was quoted as saying.
``But relations between them will develop as between two sovereign
states. The German Democratic Republic remains a sovereign country,
and there can be no argument about it.''

   Congress made little headway in whittling down
a pile of troublesome budget, health and other bills in a rare
Sunday session, as members aimed their sights at adjourning for the
year before Thanksgiving.
   Like school children with bad work habits, lawmakers saved some
of their most intractable problems for the end of this year's
session. Predictably, they ran into difficulties.
   House-Senate negotiators, who on Saturday announced an agreement
repealing Medicare benefits for elderly people with lengthy
illnesses, met again Sunday to consider retaining parts of the
program.
   The House voted 349-57 Sunday evening to completely eliminate
the so-called catastrophic care benefits _ including the unpopular
tax on the elderly that finances the program _ but the Senate
rejected a total repeal on a voice vote.
   A separate deficit-reduction bill _ also agreed to Saturday by
bargainers from the two chambers _ ran into problems as well. Some
legislators complained it failed to achieve the $14 billion in
savings President Bush has demanded.
   ``It's not good enough to reach the $14 billion that everybody
says we ought to reach,'' complained Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
ranking Republican on the budget committee, emerging from a meeting
of GOP Senate leaders and White House officials.
   ``All of us recognize we have some concerns,'' said House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., after a session attended
by top congressional Democrats.
   Confusion reigned about the effect the measure would have on
this year's federal shortfall, which congressional budget experts
think will reach about $141 billion.
   What appeared certain was that the measure would raise $5.3
billion in new tax revenues and include billions of dollars in
savings gimmicks, such as not counting the money-losing Postal
Service's budget.
   All parties seemed to agree extra savings would be earned by
keeping the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law's cuts in federal
programs _ which started Oct. 1 _ in effect until January or later.
   Yet another hot issue was dumped into Congress' lap Sunday when
Bush vetoed the $14.6 billion foreign aid bill, citing funds for a
United Nations agency that conservatives say supports forced
abortions in China.
   The House planned to consider a new version of the bill on
Monday. Efforts were expected to add language dealing with aid to
El Salvador, which is reeling from renewed fighting in its ongoing
civil war.
   According to congressional records, the session was only the
13th time the Senate has met on a Sunday. The first occurred March
3, 1861, when 20 votes were taken on the issue of slavery.
Incomplete records showed the House had met on four other Sundays
since 1978.
   There appeared to be few lawmakers in the Capitol as the House
and Senate were gaveled to business at 1 p.m. Some of those who
appeared in either chamber appeared frustrated that there was
little floor work to do.
   ``Where's the Senate?'' Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., asked a nearly
empty chamber. ``Where's the action?''
   In the first burst of substantive business, the House by voice
vote sent the $286 billion defense bill for the new fiscal year to
Bush for his signature. The measure cuts $1.1 billion from Bush's
$4.9 billion fiscal 1990 proposal for the Star Wars anti-missile
program, the first reduction in the program's funds in six years.
   But closed-door strategy sessions and bargaining among
congressional leaders dominated the day's beginning.
   Some of those talks involved legislation enacted last year, with
bipartisan support, extending Medicare coverage to victims of
long-term illnesses to cover their doctor and hospital bills. The
measure provided coverage to 33 million Americans.
   Many senior citizens have complained about the way the program
was paid for _ annual surtaxes reaching $800 this year for the 40
percent of the elderly who are the most well-off.
   The House voted earlier this year to repeal the entire program.
The Senate chose to leave reimbursement of hospital costs and other
minor provisions in place. After weeks of bargaining, Senate
negotiators accepted the House position early Saturday.
   The chief sponsor of the Senate version, Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., threatened procedural delays to try to block enactment of
the repeal legislation.

<TEXT>
   Genetic tests on a 10-year-old girl who
has been at the center of a baby-swap controversy prove she is the
child of the couple who claim her and not the man who raised her,
attorneys for both sides said Sunday.
   John Blakely, attorney for Ernest and Regina Twigg, said the
tests give a 99.9 percent certainty that Kimberly Michelle Mays is
the daughter of the Twiggs and not of Robert Mays and his late wife.
   ``Today's the day that ends the guessing,'' Blakely said at a
meeting in his Clearwater office attended by the Twiggs and their
seven other children, age 6 to 21.
   The couple say Kimberly was switched with another child at a
Florida maternity hospital shortly after birth. The girl the Twiggs
named Arlena and raised as their own died last year.
   After learning the test results, Mays sat quietly for a few
moments, then asked for the location of Arlena's grave in
Pennsylvania, his attorney, Arthur Ginsburg, said at a news
conference in Sarasota.
   ``Certainly he was prepared for this,'' Ginsburg said. ``It was
pretty clear there was a heavy probability this was true. I think
he was hoping against hope. That wasn't the case.''
   Ginsburg said he had double-checked the test results.
   ``There's no question that this child is the child of Ernest and
Regina Twigg and there is no question that the child that died was
Bob Mays' child,'' the attorney said.
   Mays, who was in seclusion Sunday, plans to spend some days
alone with Kimberly, Ginsburg said.
   ``I think the tack he will take is, `Don't worry, I'm still
going to be your daddy,''' Ginsburg said.
   Mays agreed to genetic testing only after the Twiggs promised
not to seek custody of the hazel-eyed fifth-grader if she turned
out to be their biological daughter. Under the agreement, the
Twiggs retain the option to seek visitation rights.
   But Ginsburg said Sunday that Mays may seek to block the Twiggs'
visitation rights if psychologists determine it would be too
traumatic for the girl. Mrs. Twigg said she and her husband may
exchange letters and scrapbooks with Kimberly before meeting in
person.
   The Twiggs began their fight last year after learning through
genetic tests that the girl they raised as their own, Arlena Twigg,
was not their biological daughter. She died of a heart defect in
1988, never knowing about the questions raised. The Twiggs said a
blood test before her death revealed Arlena was not related to
either of them.
   A lab report from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore said
eight different genetic tests concur that Kimberly is not related
to Robert Mays or the parents of his deceased wife.
   Blakely said it is not known when the couple will have their
first meeting with the girl. Also, visitation schedules have not
been finalized and the pact must still be approved by a Sarasota
Circuit Court judge.
   ``We're very anxious to see her,'' said Mrs. Twigg on Sunday.
   Blakley said he learned the test results Friday, but did not go
public immediately to give Mays a chance to talk with Kimberly in
private.
   Ernest and Regina Twigg moved from Langhorne, Pa., to Sebring
this fall to be closer to the girl. They had moved from Florida to
Pennsylvania two years ago in part to seek medical treatment for
Arlena.
   Mays, a Sarasota roofing contractor, agreed for himself and
Kimberly to give blood samples after the Twiggs pledged not to seek
custody.
   Mays' first wife, Barbara, died in 1981.
   The Twiggs have sued Hardee Memorial Hospital in U.S. District
Court in Tampa, claiming employees at the Wauchula hospital
switched their baby shortly after birth for Arlena, who was sickly
even as a newborn. The only other white girl born at Hardee about
the same time in late 1978 was Kimberly.
   In the federal suit filed by Blakely, the Twiggs claimed the
switch occurred through negligence, medical malpractice or
deliberate acts. Blakely said it would be up to a jury to decide
how the mistake was made.

   The first memorial to Cardinal Jozsef
Mindszenty, who was convicted of treason in a Stalinist show trial
in the 1940s, was dedicated Sunday in a western village, the state
news agency MTI reported.
   The monument _ two crosses carved out of a block of stone _ was
placed in outside a church in the village of Nemesgulacs that
Mindszenty had founded.
   Following a memorial Mass, church and other representatives met
in the village cultural center to discuss Mindszenty's historical
role, MTI said.
   The Roman Catholic primate was arrested in 1948 and sentenced a
year later to life in prison for treason after confessing to most
of the charges against him. Earlier this month, prosecutors
determined that the confession was illegally coerced, presumably
under duress or drugs.
   He was freed during the 1956 popular uprising and took refuge in
the U.S. Embassy. The uprising was crushed by Soviet tanksn.
   In 1971, the Vatican arranged for his departure from Hungary. He
was removed as primate in 1974. He died a year later at age 83.

   About 3,000 people, including weeping
police officers and firefighters, jammed a memorial service Sunday
for seven children whose lives ended suddenly when a tornado tore
into their elementary school.
   ``We gather here because, despite the inadequacy of our words,
so great a grief cannot be borne without being shared,'' Gov. Mario
Cuomo told mourners at Valley Central High School.
   ``Death, like life, is a mystery ... a mystery that deepens when
the people taken from us are like Amy, Joanna, Larae, Peter,
Charles, Adam and Maria,'' said Cuomo, naming the youngsters
crushed under a wall Thursday. ``So young, so bright, so innocent,
so loved and so lovely.''
   Many residents greeted each other with silent hugs as they
arrived for the service.
   ``We have come together in response to an experience that has
shattered us and unified us,'' the Rev. John Rottenberg of the
First Reformed Church in Walden said.
   The school's auditorium, which seats 1,200, was packed with
1,500 people. About 1,500 more mourners crowded around loudspeakers
in cafeterias, classrooms and hallways of the school, straining to
hear the service.
   Some inside the auditorium wept, including police officers and
firefighters who were among the first to reach the disaster.
   ``Everybody hurts deeply and we need each other now,'' said
Elena Stahl, a sixth-grade teacher at Valley Central Elementary
School, before the service. ``By being together we will find some
solace.''
   Vera DiBitetto stroked the blond hair of her 5-year-old son
Michael. She said it will be a sad Thanksgiving Day for the
community.
   ``It will be a terrible memory for the families every year about
this time,'' she said. ``Maybe it will make us all a little more
thankful for what we have right now.''
   Several speakers urged mourners to be hopeful in the face of
tragedy.
   The Rev. Raymond McCracken of the Coldenham Reformed
Presbyterian Church said he'd been able to rejoice for the families
whose children had been saved as well as weep for the children who
died and their families.
   ``By God's grace, may be all be able to do that: Rejoice for
those who rejoice and weep for those who weep,'' McCracken said.
   The seven students, aged 7 or 8, were killed at the East
Coldenham Elementary School when the wall of the cafeteria room
where they were lunching gave way during a tornado. Eighteen others
were injured, two critically.
   On Saturday, hundreds of mourners, many of them young children
who wept uncontrollably, filled funeral chapels to hear services
for two young victims of the tornado, Peter Orsino Jr. and Larae
Marie Litchhult, both 8. Five of their classmates will be buried
Monday.
   More bad luck struck Newburgh on Sunday when a 5-year-old
student at the East Coldenham school was critically injured in an
automobile accident. A vehicle struck the car she was riding in a
few hundred yards from the school.
   A car driven by Rosalie Sbordone's mother was hit by a vehicle
driven by Roland Hoehn, 44, of Savannah, Ga. Hoehn was charged with
reckless driving and failure to keep right. Rosalie was in critical
condition at St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh.
   A steady stream of parents and children also flocked to the East
Coldenham Elementary School Sunday, many carrying flowers, candles
and letters to the victims.
   ``Our Hearts Go Out To Those Who Have Lost,'' read a
heart-shaped plaque that leaned against a wooden wall that now
serves as the cafeteria wall.
   ``Please Pray For The Children'' was painted in blue on three
panels of that wall.
   Flowers adorned the trodden ground outside the cafeteria.
Letters were also placed near the now-demolished cafeteria wall
encouraging families to be strong.
   ``Children _ The Greatest Gift God Can Give Us,'' read one note.
   ``God never promised us that we would not have these terrible
times in our lives ... that there would not be hurricanes and
tornados, earthquakes and floods,'' Bechtel said during the
services for Peter Orsino. ``But it is in our sorrow and grief, our
anger and our frustration that we need to find a way to help us
live our todays and our tomorrows.''

   New England Telephone Co. workers voted late
Sunday to accept a new contract and end a 15-week-old strike.
   Officials for the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers said the union's members will return to their jobs Monday
at New England Telephone Co.
   ``We are very pleased that our employees have ratified the
contract,'' company spkesman Peter Cronin said late Sunday. The
contract vote was held at union locals in New Hampshire, Vermont,
Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, with the results being
tallied in Maine.
   About 18,000 IBEW workers have been on strike since Aug. 6
against New England Telephone, a subsidiary of Nynex Corp.
   About 40,000 Nynex workers in New York also have been on strike,
but talks broke off this weekend between the phone company and the
Communications Workers of America, which represents the New York
employees.
   Nynex had resolved the larger, regional issues with the unions
last week, covering wages and benefits. But the unions then had to
negotiate local contract issues.
   At first official count, striking IBEW members voted 7-1 in
favor of both regional and local packages, said George Nadeau,
chairman of the T6 Council in Maine, the administrative branch of
the ten regional locals.
   ``Both have been accepted on a comfortable margin,'' said Nadeau
following the final tally Sunday night.
   On Saturday, negotiators for New England Telephone and the IBEW
announced they would send out for ratification a proposed contract
covering both the regional NYNEX and local agreements.
   But union officials in Boston opposed the move, saying they were
unhappy with the proposed settlement of local issues.
   Dennis Banks, a business agent for the IBEW in Boston, said he
had hoped the union membership would reject the plan.
   A key dispute with New England Telephone was the company's use
of outside contractors to perform certain jobs. As part of the
local negotiations, union officials wanted the company to end this
practice, ``or at least put a cap on it,'' Banks said.
   But he said the union could not get New England Telephone to
change its position.

<HEAD>Filipino Voters Consider Autonomy For Provinces</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with returns indicating plan rejected,
winning approval in only three provinces. No pickup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most voters in 13 southern
provinces and nine cities rejected the government's plan for a
regional autonomous administration, officials reported Monday.
   They said the proposal was winning approval in only three
provinces.
   Sunday's election was to determine what areas wanted to join an
autonomous government proposed by President Corazon Aquino's
administration to satisfy Moslem demands for self-rule and end
their rebellion.
   Some politicians said the overwhelming rejection by a majority
of the voters would strengthen the position of Moslem rebel Moro
National Liberation Front, which opposed the plan. Southern
Christian leaders also had rejected the proposal.
   Critics said the outcome was a severe blow to Mrs. Aquino, who
promoted the autonomy plan but then declined to say if she was for
or against it.
   Radio and television stations reported that up to 90 percent of
the electorate in some districts voted against the plan.
   They said the election generally was peaceful.
   Ballot counting was delayed by a power failure in Zamboanga, the
election commission's regional center for compiling results. Final
tallies were not expected for several days.
   A commission official said the proposal was ahead in the
predominantly Moslem provinces of Tawi-Tawi, Sulu and Lanao del Sur.
   Political observers have said if autonomy us accepted only in
scattered Moslem areas the new administration would not be
economically viable.
   The region's 4 million Moslems form a majority in only five
provinces, which are geographically separated and are among the
nation's poorest. Christians form the majority in the provinces of
Mindanao and other southern islands.
   The Supreme Court ruled any province or city where a majority of
the voters approve the plan will join the autonomous government,
even if only one jusidiction approves. The court said the issue was
not whether to approve the concept of an autonomous govermnent but
only to decide whether to join one.
   The Congress approved the autonomy act in July.
   The Moslem rebel leader vowed to keep fighting regardless of the
outcome.
   Moslem insurgents raided 10 villages in Maguindanao province and
scattered violence was reported elsewhere Sunday but military
authorities declared the balloting more peaceful than most
observers had predicted.
   ``The voting has gone through and there was no major disturbance
that we experienced,'' said Maj. Hermogenes Esperon, spokesman of
the Southern Command.
   He reported clashes with Communist guerrillas in three different
places on Mindanao island, but said ``that is normal here'' and
unrelated to balloting.
   In Zamboanga, a largely Christian city 560 miles south of
Manila, troops guarded polling stations and armed foot patrols were
seen throughout the city.
   Mrs. Aquino forged a cease-fire with the Moslem rebels in 1986.
Peace talks collapsed in May 1987, but the cease-fire generally has
held. Before the Moslem rebellion peaked in the mid-1970s, about
50,000 people were killed and thousands more fled to the nearby
Malaysian state of Sabah.

<HEAD>Miller Uses its Muscle To Transplant Midwestern Beer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The name Leinenkugel might cause some beer
drinkers to raise their eyebrows more than their mugs, but Miller
Brewing Co. hopes the brand that has a loyal following in the
Midwest can do the same elsewhere.
   The Jacob Leinenkugel Brewing Co., a small, family-run brewery
for more than a century in Chippewa Falls, Wis., was bought in 1988
by Miller. Leinenkugel had developed a cult of customers in the
Upper Midwest, but now Miller is using its muscle to test the brand
on both coasts.
   The strategy by Miller, the nation's No. 2 brewer behind
Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., comes amid a flat period in the overall
domestic beer market, as companies have grown more experimental in
trying to gain a bigger share.
   ``Miller really knows how to introduce new products,'' said
Robert Weinberg, a beer analyst and a professor of marketing
management at Washington University in St. Louis. ``If it works,
they jump on the bandwagon.''
   ``If the Leinenkugel brand tickles people, either because of the
name or the taste, Miller could take it national overnight,'' he
said.
   According to industry estimates, Leinenkugel sold nearly 100,000
barrels last year, compared with national brands that sell in the
millions.
   Miller, a division of Philip Morris Cos. Inc., started testing
the market for Leinenkugel earlier this year in Seattle and western
Massachusetts.
   Jake Leinenkugel, who remained an executive at the brewery after
the buyout, said Miller is trying to take a low-key approach in
promoting the beer.
   ``We want to go in a little mysterious, a little quiet,''
Leinenkugel said. ``We don't want to go in with a heavy media
campaign. We want it to be discovered.''
   The company is using this approach so the beer retains its
mystique, he said, and part of the promotion includes a description
of the beer's heritage in western Wisconsin.
   ``It does have that local, regional mystique to it,'' said Jeff
Mendel, assistant director of the Institute for Brewing Studies in
Boulder, Colo. ``I don't think they're trying to lift and
transplant it. I think they're trying to spread it.''
   Miller deliberately kept its name off the Leinenkugel label.
   ``I think there's a perception that a large mass producer
cheapens the product somewhat,'' Mendel said. ``It's possible
Miller's thinking they don't want that perception.''
   Said Leinenkugel: ``There was concern at the outset about the
company losing some of its identity after being bought by Miller.
We don't want to lose that, and neither do they.''
   Jerry Steinman, publisher of the industry newsletter Beer
Marketers Insights, said beer companies, including Miller, more
commonly have spent a lot of time and money starting a brand from
scratch. But in this case, Miller is taking a different approach.
   ``They have a base of something to work on,'' Steinman said.
``They know they have a brand with a reputation. Miller knows it
has the marketing power to take it to a new level.''
   Massachusetts, in particular, has been fertile ground for
regional brands, such as Samuel Adams and Harpoon, both based in
Boston.
   ``There's more and more local brands,'' Mendel said. ``It's
going to be a tough nut for Leinenkugel. They will have to rely on
their Upper Midwest roots because (in Massachusetts) there's
already a number of local brands.''

   Federal regulators closed a
minority-owned bank after they could not find a buyer for it.
   The 5,100 people with insured accounts at Security National Bank
were told they could withdraw their money Monday, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. said.
   ``The FDIC determined that a payoff of insured depositors was
required because no acceptable bids were received for the failed
bank,'' the agency said in a statement issued late Saturday.
   The FDIC closed the bank Friday but continued negotiations
Saturday with the only potential buyer. However, no deal was
reached.
   The bank had assets of $19.4 million and about $18.5 million in
deposits. Nearly all of that money was insured, the statement said.
   Unsafe lending practices, inability to hire and keep capable
management and inadequate oversight by the board of directors were
among the problems which led to Security National's demise, FDIC
official Robert Herrmann said.
   ``The depressed local economy, to some extent, aggravated the
bank's existing weaknesses,'' said Herrmann, senior deputy
comptroller for bank supervision.

   American Ship Building Co.'s Tampa Shipyards
division, which had feared layoffs because of lack of work, said it
has won a contract to finish construction on two U.S. Navy tankers.
   ``It's great news,'' George Steinbrenner, American Ship's

   The Navy announced Friday it will pay $49 million for labor
alone in the two-year contract, which is expected to employ 800
workers, said Steinbrenner, who also is the principal owner of the
New York Yankees baseball team.
   The tankers were being built at the Pennsylvania Shipbuilding
Co. in Chester, Pa., but are now in the Philadelphia Naval
Shipyard, where the Navy moved them in late October after
Pennsylvania Shipbuilding said it couldn't complete the job for the
promised price of $331.4 million. The tankers are already 70
percent complete.
   Employment at Tampa Shipyards has hovered at about 600, but with
no major contracts in sight, union officials during the summer
warned of major layoffs and perhaps closing of the yard.
   For the quarter ended June 30, American Ship lost $2 million on
revenues of $13.8 million, compared with a loss in the same period
last year of $1.7 million on revenues of $20.7 million. For the
first nine months of the latest fiscal year, the company lost $6.6
million on revenues of $50.4 million.

<HEAD>Westinghouse Seeks Bigger Fees For Managing Nuclear Plants</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. is proposing big
increases in the fees it receives from the U.S. Department of
Energy for managing nuclear weapons plants.
   Westinghouse officials said they want two to three times more
for managing three nuclear weapons facilities and three other DOE
nuclear units. The weapons facilities are Savannah River in South
Carolina, Fernald near Cincinnati and the Hanford nuclear
reservation near Richland, Wash.
   The Pittsburgh-based company earned about $39 million in award
fees this year, which are based on the company's performance in
operating the plants. It estimates it will earn up to $50 million
in fiscal 1990 under existing contracts.
   William M. Jacobi, vice president in charge of Westinghouse's
governmental business operations, said the company seeks the higher
fees because of ``risks we're seeing now that we didn't see
before.''
   Operating the plants, he said, is more of a high-profile
activity than it was when Westinghouse took over its first DOE
facility in 1982. Since then, the plants have become the target of
citizen and environmental groups, which have questioned the plants'
safety and disposal of nuclear waste.
   ``There is a much higher potential for some event happening that
could damage the corporate reputation,'' Jacboi said. ``We worry
about it quite a bit.''
   Westinghouse expects some members of Congress to oppose fee
hikes. But Energy Secretary James D. Watkins said last month that
contractors should receive greater incentives because of increasing
accountability and risk.

<HEAD>Iacocca No Longer Star of Union Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca, normally the
main attraction at an annual meeting of United Auto Workers
leaders, has bowed out this year amid union charges of breaking
promises.
   Iacocca told the union in a letter Friday that he wouldn't
attend this year's meeting of 200 company managers and local UAW
leaders in Louisville, Chrysler sources told The Detroit News on
condition of anonymity.
   UAW leaders have condemned Iacocca's decision to halt production
of Horizon and Omni subcompacts at the Jefferson Avenue Assembly
Plant in Detroit, a move expected to force the layoff of 1,700
workers.
   Chrysler has blamed poor sales of the aging models for the
plant's scheduled Feb. 2 closing. UAW leaders said the move means
the automaker is reneging on national and local contract guarantees
to operate the plant until construction is completed on nearby
replacement facility sometime in 1991.
   Iacocca said he has to miss the Nov. 29 meeting because of
previous commitments, not because of the Jefferson Assembly
dispute, the News reported. Union officials see it differently.
   ``We thought he'd wiggle out of it,'' said Bob Pearson, a UAW
committeeman at Jefferson Assembly. ``He doesn't want to face us.''
   Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald and Chrysler Motors
President Robert Lutz are expected to address the union leaders in
place of Iacocca, the company said.
   The UAW-Chrysler meetings have been held every year since 1986.
Iacocca has been consistently greeted by cheers from the union, but
UAW leaders considered boycotting this year's meeting.
   Some of those leaders met last week in Detroit to discuss ways
to pressure Chrysler to keep the Jefferson plant open. Possible
actions include a demonstration at company headquarters and local
strikes.
   Chrysler said it will begin recalling workers in the fall of
1991 for training at the new plant.

   Amdahl Corp. cited expenses increasing
faster than sales in announcing the layoff of 400 workers at the
mainframe computer company's manufacturing plant.
   Company spokesman Bill Stewart said the layoff of 5 percent of
Amdahl's work force took place immediately upon its announcement
Friday, affecting jobs across the board.
   Amdahl makes mainframe computers compatible with those of
International Business Machines Corp., which this year cut prices
on its large machines by as much as 50 percent. Amdahl followed
suit, but profits suffered.
   For the quarter ended Sept. 29, Amdahl earned $32.9 million,
down 37 percent from the same quarter last year, despite a 15
percent revenue increase.
   Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix, said
Amdahl remains essentially healthy and the layoffs _ Amdahl's first
since the early 1980s _ could mean a 2 to 3 percent increase in the
Sunnyvale-based company's pretax profits.
   John Girton, an analyst with Van Kasper &amp; Co. in San Francisco,
said mainframe computers are falling out of favor with some
corporations, which are turning to desktop systems. The trend could
hurt Amdahl and other mainframe computer makers, he said.

<HEAD>Government Comes To Rescue of Slumping Foreign Auto Firms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has moved to bail out foreign auto ventures
suffering from low production and large stockpiles resulting from a
government austerity program, the official China Daily said Sunday.
   The report said the People's Bank of China and the Industrial
and Commercial Bank have provided large loans to enable the
government to buy stockpiled Volkswagens, Chrysler Corp. Jeeps and
Peugeots produced in China.
   The loans to rescue the high-profile joint ventures are the
latest crack in the government's year-old austerity program, which
was designed to cool off the overheated economy by sharply reducing
credit and slashing public spending.
   With industrial output value falling in October in the first
decline in a decade and fears of a recession growing, the
government has begun to pour huge amounts of money into failing
state enterprises. It also has had to provide large loans to local
banks lacking funds to pay for this year's grain harvest.
   The daily, quoting Xu Bingjin, an official in charge of auto
ventures in the State Planning Commission, said so far the
government had bought 1,500 Santanas produced in Volkswagen's
Shanghai plant, 500 Jeep Cherokees from the Beijing Jeep Corp and
800 Peugeots from the French company's joint venture in Canton.
   The government said it will later sell the cars to domestic
buyers, mainly public offices, deemed to be in urgent need of
vehicles.
   The Santana, Jeep and Peugeot models, together with Volkswagen
Audis produced in the northeastern city of Changchun, are the only
passenger vehicles made in China.
   All have been hit by the austerity program that has imposed
stiff luxury taxes on vehicles, banned most public institutes from
buying new cars and made it more difficult to import parts needed
for assembly plants.
   Volkswagen, which will produce about 15,000 Santanas this year,
almost all for the domestic Chinese market, reportedly has a
stockpile of 3,000 vehicles and is operating at only 50 percent
capacity.
   The government apparently is helping the automakers out of
concern that their troubles would add to the negative image of
China's investment climate, which has suffered since the bloody
military suppression of pro-democracy dissent in June.
   Xu said the government loosened controls on car consumption last
month to ease the burden on the joint ventures.
   ``China's tight budget and control of luxury consumption does
not mean (China will) close its door to the outside world,'' he
said, adding that China wants ``to create a better environment for
foreign investors.''
   The government in 1986 came to the rescue of Beijing Jeep, then
a partnership that included the former American Motors Corp., after
the celebrated Sino-U.S. joint venture was forced to shut down
because it lacked the foreign currency to import needed parts.
   Xu also criticized the French government for withholding loans
for a new joint venture agreed upon in August between the No. 2
Automobile Factory in Hubei province and France's Citroen.
   France's failure to provide the loan has brought heavy losses to
China, Xu said.
   ``If the French government continues to delay the loan, we would
not rule out the possibility of looking for new foreign partners
for the joint venture,'' he said.
   The project, which calls for initial production of 150,000 cars
and 200,000 engines annually when the plant opens in 1993, was to
be financed with $1.1 billion and would be China's biggest project
ever in its mechanical industry.

   The Air Force had hoped to present President
Reagan with a new Air Force One in time to take him on his
Thanksgiving vacation last year, but the high-tech jet probably
won't be ready before mid-1990, various sources say.
   ``We had hoped it would be done by the end of President Reagan's
term, but of course, it's not even close,'' Air Force spokesman Lt.
Col. Darrell Hayes said in an interview last week.
   Design problems and cost overruns are delaying the new 747 and a
back-up twin being constructed by Boeing Military Airplanes Co., in
Wichita, Kan. Congress approved funds to replace the two vintage
Boeing 707s that now ferry the president, his staff and media.
   The oldest of the two 707s entered the presidential fleet Oct.
12, 1962. The second plane was delivered to the Air Force Aug. 4,
1972.
   Problems with wiring forced the initial delay in the
replacements, Hayes said.
   Besides being crammed with antennas, televisions, computers,
cryptography equipment and an antimissile system, the plane is
designed to serve the president's communications needs at any point
around the globe with ``hardened'' gear, which would not be
affected by the electronic waves generated by a nuclear blast.
   The increased requirements for the plane means it needs twice as
much wiring as a normal 747, Hayes said.
   ``The design for the wiring didn't work. They had to rip it out
and start all over again,'' said a congressional source familiar
with the plane's progress, but who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Additional delays came from a new Federal Aviation
Administration directive for a ``fire suppression system'' in
certain areas of the plane, said Boeing spokesman Pete Dakan.
   ``The work had to be done at some time, so we decided to make
the adjustment now, rather than bringing it back later'' to adjust
the system, Dakan said.
   Settling on a new delivery date also has been complicated by the
machinists' strike that has plagued Boeing, Hayes said.
   But Dakan said work is still going on and that the plane is
undergoing the first of its ground tests, such as turning on its
lights.
   ``It looks fine,'' he said.
   Although neither the Air Force spokesman nor Dakan said they
could predict a new delivery date, a White House official, speaking
privately, said the first plane is not expected before mid-1990.
   The second is supposed to be delivered six-to-eight months after
the first, said Hayes.
   As the delays have grown, so have the costs.
   Boeing was awarded a fixed-price contract of $249.8 million for
the twin 747s in the summer of 1986.
   Asked about a report that the costs have skyrocketed to $650
million from the original price, Dakan derided the figure as ``an
Air Force estimate.''
   At any rate, he said, Boeing must bear the brunt of cost
overruns and ``pay for anything outside the contract.''
   The Air Force has said the new plane will have a
state-of-the-art emergency medical facility, special work and rest
areas for the president and his staff, the Secret Service and the
media.
   The new planes, which have 4,000 square-foot interiors, will be
able to fly more than 7,000 miles non-stop and thus avoid refueling
stops that now force the president to land in spots like Guam or
Anchorage on long-distance trips.
   Instead of the 400 passengers that usually are carried aboard a
747, the new planes will be outfitted to carry about 70 passengers
and a crew of 23. The present planes carry 59 passengers and a crew
of 10.
   The term Air Force One is actually a radio call signal applied
to any airplane that is carrying a president. But the term has
become synonymous with the two Boeing 707s that are maintained at
Andrews Air Force Base, Md., by the 89th Military Airlift Wing.

<HEAD>Creditors Reject Marvin Warner's Bid To Modify Bankruptcy Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `U.S. Bankruptcy ...,' to UPDATE with hearing
dates.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Ohio financier Marvin Warner
agreed Sunday to drop a bid to modify a $16 million settlement of
his personal bankruptcy case after his proposed change was
immediately rejected by a creditors' committee.
   Warner had offered Sunday to increase the settlement to $17.5
million on the condition he be allowed to pursue lawsuits against
the accounting firms Grant Thornton and Arthur Anderson &amp; Co, which
had audited Warner's failed Home State Savings Bank in Cincinnati.
Under the original plan, all litigation would be settled.
   Warner's attorneys agreed to drop the modifications after
creditors refused to allow the case to be tied up in further
lawsuits.
   James Post, an attorney for the committee, said Warner's
proposed change amounted to him reneging on the settlement.
   By the end of the hearing, Warner agreed to deposit $10 million
with creditors before Dec. 4, and have the case be converted from
its current Chapter 11 status to a Chapter 7 liquidation if he
doesn't come up with the money, Post said.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge George Proctor said it would be impossible
Sunday to formally approve the plan and scheduled further hearings
for Dec. 3 in Jacksonville and Dec. 4 in Orlando.
   Earlier Sunday, Warner said he was justified in suing the
accounting firms that monitored Home State, which Warner owned,
before it collapsed in 1985.
   Another kink in the settlement developed Wednesday when a
three-judge panel of the 1st Ohio District Court of Appeals tossed
out Warner's criminal convictions stemming from the Home State
collapse.
   Warner filed for protection from creditors in October 1987 under
federal bankruptcy law to halt $4 billion worth of claims against
him.
   In September, Warner and his attorneys announced they had
reached a settlement of the claims under which Warner would pay $16
million.
   Warner, 70, who lives in Ocala, was supposed to sign and deliver
documents before Wednesday stating his agreement to put a total of
$16 million into his estate to pay off creditors. Under the
agreement, the state of Ohio would receive about $8 million.
   But Warner never delivered the documents and failed to deposit
the funds required in the agreement, according to a motion filed
Thursday in bankruptcy court.
   Meanwhile, in Ohio, prosecutors said they will ask the state
Supreme Court to reinstate Warner's conviction.
   A Hamilton County Common Pleas Court jury convicted Warner in
March 1987 on charges resulting from Home State's collapse. Warner
was sentenced to 3{ years in prison.
   Ohio has spent $5.6 million prosecuting the case against Warner
and has made provisions to recover about $135 million as
reimbursement for protecting Home State's depositors, according to
Ohio Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze Jr.
   Home State had about $1.4 billion in assets and served about
92,000 depositors. It was sold and reopened in June 1985.
   Home State's collapse caused a crisis for 69 other Ohio savings
and loans whose deposits were insured by the Ohio Deposit Guarantee
Fund.
