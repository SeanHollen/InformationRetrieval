   Relatives of those killed by the bomb that
destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 should direct their anger at the airline
and the U.S. government, not Britain, a legislator of the governing
party said Friday.
   Pan Am confirmed it had been warned by the West German government
Nov. 10 about the kind of radio-cassette player bomb involved.
   In Washington, Bush administration officials said investigators
believe they found bits of the suitcase that contained the plastic
explosive that destroyed the Pan Am jumbo jet in December, the New
York Times reported Saturday.
   The officials, who spoke anonymously, said experts are analyzing
the chemical makeup of the shards to determine the suitcase brand
and trace the owner, the Times reported.
   Politicians of the opposition Labor Party charged Transport
Secretary Paul Channon with bungling a warning dated two days before
the disaster but not mailed until several days later.
   John Prescott, the Labor transportation spokesman, accused the
government of planting stories in several London newspapers Friday
that said the bomber was identified or even arrested.
   Scottish and West German authorities denied the reports of an
arrest.
   Investigators have said a bomb in a radio-cassette player brought
the Boeing 747 down Dec. 21, killing all 259 people aboard and 11
residents of the market town of Lockerbie, Scotland.
   David Wilshire of the Conservative Party, who specializes in
transportation issues, said some relatives of victims have been
``blaming the British government, blaming Heathrow, blaming anybody
except the people I think they ought to be complaining about, namely
the American government and Pan Am.''
   West Germany had warned Pan Am, which also received a warning
from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration on Nov. 18, Wilshire
said, ``so what has it got to do with the British government? Are
Pan Am deaf or not?''
   In New York, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed Friday
that the West German government's warning was received Nov. 10.
   Responding to Wilshire's charge that the airline ``forgot to tell
anybody'' about earlier warnings, she said: ``Frankly, I don't think
it's for the company to disclose that.''
   Ms. Hanlon said Pan Am tightened security after receiving the
warning and those precautions remained in effect.
   The West German warning followed the arrest Oct. 26 of 13 alleged
members of a radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command. Authorities reported
seizing a radio-cassette player bomb with a detonator rigged to go
off at high altitude.
   West German officials briefed representatives of the United
States, Britain and other nations in November about the discovery,
Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for West Germany's chief prosecutor,
said Friday in Karlsruhe.
   ``There were pictures and an explanation of how the bomb
functioned,'' he said. ``This was about three weeks after it was
found because it took time to analyze the device.''
   Prechtel said the West Germans told their colleagues such a
device could blow up a jetliner, but did not name a specific threat.
   The FAA notified U.S. flag carriers, including Pan Am, on Nov.
18, and Britain notified its national carriers Nov. 22.
   Criticism of Channon arose this week with the disclosure that the
Transport Department prepared a warning dated Dec. 19, two days
before the disaster, that included photographs of a mock
radio-cassette bomb and sent it by mail.
   Channon told The Times of London the warning was not mailed until
after the disaster, but he insisted it contained no information not
already gven to Pan Am.
   At issue are two warnings: the November alert from West Germany
and an anonymous telephone call received Dec. 5 by the U.S. Embassy
in Helsinki, Finland, claiming a Palestinian group would attack a
U.S.-bound Pan Am flight originating in Frankfurt within two weeks.
   Elizabeth Delude-Dix, an American whose Irish husband was killed
on Flight 103, said Thursday she was ``bewildered and also very
angry.''
   ``Now we know that the government had information which told them
the carrier that would be affected _ Pan American; the origin of the
flight _ Frankfurt; that the threatened period was during the month
of December, and now we've learned that they also had information
about the exact kind of bomb that was used.''
   Lord Fraser, Scotland's senior law enforcement officer, said
Friday the Helsinki warning was bogus.
   ``Police officers went to Helsinki and made inquiries into that
particular warning _ which was made anonymously _ and the conclusion
reached now is that that phone call has not got any relevance to the
Lockerbie disaster or the subsequent inquiry,'' he said.
   Finnish authorities said in December they knew the man who made
the threat, and several previous ones, and the man who allegedly was
to plant the bomb. fe They concluded the caller was pursuing a
grudge and the man he accused was harmless.

<DATELINE>PANMUNJOM, Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With U.S. soldiers watching from guard
towers on the other side of the border, Maj. Kang Sung Nam of the
North Korean army launched a verbal assault on the Americans,
blaming them for dividing the Korean people.
   ``Panmunjom is just a military demarcation line which the
imperialist Americans drew to divide the Korean people,'' Kang told
tourists from Hong Kong during a visit to the snow-dusted truce
village on the border of North and South Korea.
   ``We hope you can go back and tell your people that we Koreans
are longing for reunification.''
   Kang then presented each tourist with a lapel pin depicting two
hands shaking across the Korean peninsula set on a background of the
North Korean flag.
   Although hundreds of thousands of troops from North and South man
the tense 155-mile-long demilitarized zone, Panmunjom is a tourist
attraction for both sides.
   The official North Korean tour of Panmunjom includes the use of a
large-scale model to explain the demilitarized zone that was set up
after the Korean War. It also includes as a visit to one of the
large huts that straddle the demarcation line, where the two sides
have negotiated since the armistice in 1953.
   The North Koreans offer a version of the 1950-53 Korean War
markedly different from that of the South Koreans and Americans, who
fought under the banner of the United Nations Command.
   Visitors are shown a 20-minute documentary accusing the United
States of invading the Communist North, using chemical weapons and
bearing sole responsibility for the peninsula's division. The film
features close-ups of wounded Korean civilians and surrendering U.S.
soldiers.
   The documentary does not mention, however, that it was North
Korea's invasion of the South on June 25, 1950 that set off the war,
nor does it refer to the Chinese who entered the conflict to help
North Korea recover from severe military setbacks.
   Kang repeatedly maintained that at the 1953 truce signing in
Panmunjom, the South Korean representative was unable to speak for
his people because, he said, the negotiations were dominated by the
United States.
   The North and South remain technically at war, with each
government claiming to be the legitimate ruler of all Korea.
   But in recent months, the two sides have been exchanging
proposals on ending the confrontation and Panmunjom, the site of the
latest round of political talks, once again has been the focus of
attention.
   Panmunjom became neutral after the war but has been a symbol of
the division and tension on the peninsula to both North and South.
   The heavily militarized Korean peninsula includes an estimated
850,000 military regulars in North Korean and 650,000 soldiers in
South Korea, supported by a 42,000-member U.S. military contingent.
   But North Korean officials talk as though any hostilities would
come from the South.
   ``The People's Army is here to protect you,'' tour guide Yoon Mu
Ho reassured the tourists as eight North Korean soldiers stood
stiffly at attention at the truce village huts.

<TEXT>
   In a town where a mortuary is a top tourist draw
and the curious pay to visit sites of celebrity suicides, a new
theme-park ride celebrating a catastrophic California earthquake
fits right in.
   Never mind that the earthquake simulated in ``The Big One,''
which opens Saturday at Universal Studios Hollywood, could kill
14,000 people, seriously injure up to 55,000 others and cause $17
billion in property damage.
   ``It's an entertainment attraction, not a sociology experiment,''
said Sidney Sheinberg, president and chief operating officer of MCA
Inc., the theme park's parent company. ``I think this is fun. ... We
don't think this is in bad taste, or we wouldn't have done it.''
   Like the popular tours at Forest Lawn Memorial Park and the
celebrity suicide and murder junket run by the local Grave Line
Tours, the Universal Studios earthquake attraction is inherently
married to the loss of life.
   The ride has been touted as ``the scariest thing to hit
California since 1906'' when a quake struck San Francisco and killed
2,000. ``Mother Nature's fiercest demonstration of her power,''
another promotional teaser read.
   Advertising for the disaster attraction includes a billboard in
Whittier, just a few blocks from several buildings leveled by a
5.9-magnitude quake and a 5.3-magnitude aftershock in October 1987.
Eight deaths were blamed on that quake, as were 200 injuries and
$358 million in damage.
   Named after the huge temblor seismologists say will hit
California within the next 30 years, Universal's ``Big One'' was
built in an enclosed set at a cost of $14 million. Its original
opening date in November was delayed because of design problems.
   Set in a San Francisco subway station, ``The Big One'' features a
violently shaking platform on which Universal Studios tram cars sit,
a runaway subway car littered with bodies, erupting sidewalks, a
burst propane tank, a 60,000-gallon wall of water, collapsing
ceilings, sparking transformers and several other disaster-related
effects.
   ``It is threatening. You're never sure what's going to happen,''
said show designer Larry Lester.
   ``There's a thing in our business called the safe scare, where
you go to the point where entertainment value is maximized without
having (tour guests) be afraid,'' said Barry Upson, MCA's executive
vice president for planning and development. Having bodies in the
attraction's runaway subway car, he said, ``is simply show
business.''
   The 145-second simulation, staged as many as 200 times a day, is
designed to mimic an earthquake measuring 8.3 on the open-ended
Richter scale, estimated by seismologists to be about the same
magnitude as the 1906 San Francisco shock that leveled 500 square
blocks.
   An 8.3 quake centered on California's San Andreas fault is
expected to be the worst calamity to strike the United States since
the Civil War. Dams may burst, huge landslides could be triggered
and entire cities might be devastated. The Federal Emergency
Management Agency estimates that such a quake would kill 14,000. An
equally strong quake on a fault closer to downtown Los Angeles could
kill many more.
   Despite the attraction's macabre implications, ``The Big One''
was designed to lure in-state visitors to Universal's theme park,
MCA executives said. ``Where else can a Southern Californian come
and enjoy an earthquake?'' Sheinberg asked.
   With 4.2 million visitors in 1988, the Universal Studios tour _
home of the ``King Kong'' and ``Jaws'' attractions _ was the
nation's fourth most popular theme park. Adult admission is $18.95.
   A similar Universal Studios tour is scheduled to open in Florida
later this year, making the California park's need for local
visitors more pressing.
   ``Along with entertainment, this is going to be a learning
experience,'' said show designer Lester. ``I'm well aware of
earthquakes and I've been shaken up quite a bit. But I'm far more
frightened by tornadoes.''
   Charlton Heston, who starred in Universal's 1974 box office hit
``Earthquake'' and has experienced Universal's ``Big One,'' said the
ride can serve as a dress rehearsal for the killer quake many people
acknowledge is coming.
   ``I've been through a couple of real ones, but not the big one,''
said Heston, a California native. ``This is good training.''

   A 12-year-old boy who was angry because
his mother refused to allow him to have an ear pierced called police
and told them where to find eight pounds of marijuana hidden in his
home.
   Police searched the home Tuesday night and found 11 packages
containing marijuana with an estimated street value of $15,000.
   Police on Thursday said a warrant for the father's arrest was
being drafted, charging possession and distribution of marijuana.
   ``There was a dispute over him (the boy) getting a pierced ear,''
said police Lt. Brad Wiesley. ``His mother was not happy about it.
They just had a mother-son argument.''
   After the dispute, the boy called police from a nearby shopping
center.
   ``He told us about what was in the house,'' Wiesley said. ``He
wasn't too happy that there was marijuana in the house.''
   The boy, one of four children in the home, was taken into
protective custody.

<TEXT>
   Scientists are digging up the century-old
remains of five prospectors caught in a snowstorm and eaten by one
of their companions, and residents hope to cash in on the notoriety
surrounding the case.
   Not everyone is pleased with the fuss being made over Alferd
Packer's cannibalism during the winter of 1874.
   ``I run into some people who wonder if we ought to give so much
attention to Alferd Packer,'' said Grant Houston, president of the
Hinsdale County Historical Society.
   ``There are a lot more worthy people who have passed through
here, but they didn't commit cannibalism. So they're boring,
compared with Packer and his hold on the popular imagination.''
   Packer was the sole survivor in a party of six prospectors who
got caught in snows near Slumgullion Pass, and he later admitted
eating the flesh of his five companions.
   He insisted he killed only one, in self-defense, and told
conflicting tales about the other deaths.
   While scientists this summer begin exhuming the victims' bones to
determine how they died, residents of the tourism-dependent county
plan a number of special events celebrating Packer's notoriety.
   The county museum, which will open in June, will display Packer
relics, including shackles that held him and a model gallows
intended to hang him. In April 1883 Packer was convicted of
manslaughter, served a brief sentence and was pardoned in 1901. He
died a free man.
   In July, a drama based on the Packer trial will be performed in
the second-floor courtroom where Packer was tried. Members of the
audience will site as jury at each performance.
   A full line of Packer souvenirs for tourists is expected as well.
   The lead researcher of the exhumation is not amused.
   ``If this all gets out of hand, we'll just pack up and leave,''
said James E. Starrs, professor of law and forensic science at
George Washington University in Washington, D.C.

   Former national security adviser Robert
McFarlane's ``equivocal and confusing'' testimony could help Oliver
North in defending himself against charges that he lied to Congress.
   The prosecution at North's Iran-Contra trial tried to pin
McFarlane down Thursday on the question of who wrote two misleading
letters to Congress.
   The letters in September 1985 carried McFarlane's signature, but
North is accused of helping to prepare them. Three of the 12
criminal charges against North are that he obstructed Congress and
made false statements in connection with the two letters.
   Last Monday, McFarlane testified that he assumed it was North who
prepared a draft of a letter to then-U.S. Rep. Michael Barnes
denying National Security Council staffers solicited funds for the
Contras or offered tactical advice. At the time of the letter, North
_ an NSC aide _ was helping raise contributions and overseeing a
secret military supply operation.
   But on Tuesday afternoon, responding to questions from North
lawyer Brendan Sullivan, McFarlane acknowledged he wasn't sure North
had prepared the draft.
   ``I assume the prosecutors wouldn't show me something that wasn't
true,'' he added.
   ``Is there anything to show that North had anything to do with
it?'' asked Sullivan.
   ``No,'' responded McFarlane.
   On Wednesday morning, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell
declared that McFarlane had given ``equivocal and confusing
testimony.'' The question, said Gesell, is whether McFarlane or
``his subordinate North was officially and knowingly responsible for
specific activities attributed to North in the indictment.''
   On Thursday afternoon, prosecutor John Keker pressed McFarlane,
who responded that North ``was the only person who could have''
written the draft of the letter to Barnes. McFarlane said that he
had gotten a draft back and that ``I started from something.''
   In connection with the other letter, to then-House Intelligence
Committee chairman Lee Hamilton, McFarlane didn't dispute the
suggestion by Sullivan that just two paragraphs written by North,
for which he was not charged with a crime, ended up in the final
version.
   However, Keker brought out that North had reviewed a draft
prepared by McFarlane, and made some changes but left untouched the
denials regarding soliciting funds and offering tactical advice.
   ``You both knew you were doing something wrong,'' Keker told
McFarlane in reference to the two letters.
   ``I knew I was withholding information,'' responded McFarlane.
``He (North) was clearly concerned'' about how to answer them.
   ``I made a judgment and I went ahead with it,'' said the former
national security adviser.
   It was the last in a string of comments over five days of
testimony by McFarlane, one of the prosecution's central witnesses,
that appeared to be an attempt to take the burden off North.
   McFarlane repeatedly testified that he as national security
adviser was responsible for the letters.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges of
withholding information from Congress in connection with the
letters, and to two additional misdemeanor counts. He was fined
$20,000. The charges North faces are felonies each carrying a
maximum five-year prison term on conviction.

<TEXT>
   Verdi's ``Rigoletto,'' when played and sung well,
can reach inside a listener and stir up the emotions.
   The Metropolitan Opera, in its first performance of ``Rigoletto''
this season, did just that.
   Leo Nucci, who's singing in four operas at the Met this season,
sang the title role beautifully. When Nucci was singing, before
entering his house in Act 1, we feared he was just walking through
the part. But when events became emotional for Rigoletto, Nucci
became emotional. He greeted his daughter with love. Later, after
she has been raped, he is moving in his distress and tenderness for
her feelings. Rigoletto has been a callous man before, but Nucci
melts a listener's heart when singing a father's anguish.
   Hei-Kyung Hong sang Gilda, the daughter. Her voice is honey sweet
and so clear that it conveys purity and even a spiritual quality.
She sang ``Caro nome'' slowly instead of making a dazzling display
of fast coloratura. That such a girl is in love, then harmed, then
decides to die to save the unworthy man she loves makes her story
more moving than usual.
   Taro Ichihara sang the Duke. In Act 1, his voice sounded grainy,
tense on top and too mellow for a tenor in the low register.
However, after he warmed up his voice sounded more unified and made
a strongly favorable impression.
   Timothy Noble was good as Monterone, who puts a curse on
Rigoletto. When he does that, the lighting is dramatic. Nucci takes
his jester's cap off, making Rigoletto look like a person, not a
clown. The only strong light is on his horrified face. Monterone is
dimly seen. Otherwise, only lighted candles, held by chorus members,
are seen.
   Bass Jan-Hendrik Rootering also was vocally strong as the
assassin, Sparafucile.
   The orchestra and chorus were secure under conducting by Nello
Santi. He has conducted the opera at the Met before. Only four
singers of the 13 principals had sung their roles in the house
before.
   This production, which has a revolving round center structure
looking like a big wedding cake, was new in 1977. We haven't liked
it but it does provide a round balcony one flight up where
characters can sing and observe. Next season, the Met will have a
new ``Rigoletto'' production, with Nucci again in the title role and
Luciano Pavarotti as the Duke.

   The pace is picking up. The analysts are
marshaling their arguments. The specialists are checking their
figures. The prognosticators are peering into their crystal balls.
   This is the chance for defense and foreign affairs experts to
make their mark in the nearly brand new Bush administration. It is
their chance to influence policy.
   Some of them have come out of the ``think tanks'' for just this
purpose. Others are grizzled veterans of the Pentagon, the State
Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   What they are busily working on is a four-part policy report, due
April 21, that is bound to have a heavy impact on how the United
States deals with the Soviet Union, not to mention other adversaries
and allies.
   For instance, President Bush will not set a date for a resumption
of strategic weapons reduction negotiations with the Soviets until
the report is in and digested.
   The four parts are: an overall review of existing U.S. defense
forces; policy needs for the 1990s; whether changes are needed in
conventional and nuclear forces; arms control policy.
   The four parts are to be completed in sequence. At this stage,
the first is going through revisions, the second is about to be put
down in draft form. The third and fourth parts depend on the results
of the first two studies.
   With the final deadline more than a month away, the Bush
administration is likely to feel continuing heat from critics who
complain of foot-dragging.
   U.S. policy is taking shape at a very slow pace.
   Congress is demanding an early answer to what kind of mobile
missile the United States will add to its nuclear arsenal. The
choices are a single-warhead Midgetman on trucks, or the huge,
10-warhead MX launched from railroad cars.
   Then there is the question of how hard the Bush administration
wants to pursue a space-based anti-missile program. Known popularly
as Star Wars, it was dear to the heart of President Reagan, but not
to most members of Congress. There is a suspicion Bush and national
security adviser Brent Scowcroft are skeptical about developing a
reliable scheme to shoot down Soviet ballistic missiles in space.
   The Soviets, meanwhile, with a touch of impatience, want to know
when strategic weapons reductions talks will be resumed. A treaty to
cut long-range bombers, missiles and nuclear submarines by 30
percent to 50 percent, depending on the system of counting, was
about 90 percent done when talks in Geneva were suspended last
December.
   There was a tentative agreement to resume in mid-February, but
Bush ordered an indefinite postponement for the policy review. The
10 percent of the treaty that isn`t finished is a very tough 10
percent. Among the unsettled problems are whether to try to limit
mobile missiles and how to verify compliance with negotiated
cutbacks.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze tried to get
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to set a date for a resumption
when they met in Vienna March 7. But Baker said the review had to be
completed first. However, they decided to meet in Moscow sometime in
the first half of May to begin preparations for a superpower summit
meeting.
   With winter just receding from Washington, the April 21 deadline
and the Baker-Shevardnadze meeting in May seem far away. But the
clock is ticking, and all those experts and analysts want to polish
their assessments in the most convincing way.

   Fred Astaire's widow has filed a $10 million
libel lawsuit against Globe International magazine for allegedly
describing her as a reclusive, greedy slob.
   The magazine's Jan. 31 editions featured an article titled ``Fred
Astaire's Widow Is Living In A Dump'' citing sources identified only
as an ``insider'' and a ``pal,'' according to the lawsuit filed in
Superior Court on Thursday.
   The article said Robyn Astaire is bitter about not inheriting
Astaire's full estate, that she has let the couple's home fall into
disrepair and that friend's have abandoned her, the lawsuit said.
   The story also said Mrs. Astaire's home isn't cleaned regularly
and that its cupboards are bare, the lawsuit said.
   ``Plaintiff is not a miserly eccentric who is stingy in the
upkeep of her house and who refused to buy food,'' the lawsuit said.
   Globe International officials couldn't immediately be reached for
comment.
   Astaire, the debonair dancing star of such films as ``Top Hat''
and ``The Gay Divorcee,'' died at age 88 in 1987.

   Matheson and his business partner, Daniel Grodnik, said Thursday
they bought the stake in National Lampoon held by its founder and

vandals.
   Charles Suissman, who is producing the upcoming Broadway musical
``Nick and Nora,'' heard of sculptor William Van Orden's efforts to
restore the statue after it was again damaged last month and offered
to pay for a security system.
   Miss Loy posed for the Venus statue outside Venice High School in
the 1920s when she was an art student named Myrna Williams. Since
then, it's been hit by vandals about a dozen times, including one
attack in 1978 in which the head was blown off by dynamite.
   Van Orden, 66, has made it a personal crusade to restore the
statue each time, but he fears he may not be able to fix it this
time because he is suffering from cancer.
   When Suissman learned of the statue's condition, he sent Van
Orden a donation.
   Miss Loy, 83, lives in New York.

   This Florida Panhandle town is having
trouble keeping public officials in office because of their run-ins
with the law.
   Three officials have been ousted in the last year, including
former Mayor John Ed French, who has been removed from two different
jobs.
   ``I've had this happen so many times I'm used to it,'' French
said this week. ``Why is it that I was qualified to seek public
office, but not hold it?''
   Gov. Bob Martinez suspended French as mayor last year following
his conviction on an aggravated battery charge. French then was
hired as city manager but the governor suspended him from that job,
too, saying his appointment was made illegally.
   Undeterred, French won re-election as mayor last November, but
Martinez removed him from both offices _ through an executive order
Tuesday _ after an appeals court upheld his conviction in January.
State law prohibits convicted felons from holding public office.
   Walter Anderson, who lost to French in the mayoral election last
year, was named temporary mayor, but a formal move to replace French
with Anderson failed on a 2-2 vote of the City Council on Tuesday.
   The fifth councilman, Jerry Lee Griffin, was unable to vote
because Martinez had suspended Griffin after he was charged with
possession of beer with intent to distribute without a license.
   City Clerk Cheryl Green was fired last month after being accused
of embezzling from the city.
   ``We don't lack many episodes for a soap opera,'' French said.

<HEAD>Senate Gives Green Light to Impeachment Trial of Judge Hastings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Round two in the impeachment trial of Judge
Alcee L. Hastings begins today following Senate refusal to dismiss
charges that he plotted to get a $150,000 bribe and lied about it at
his trial.
   Senate leaders named a 12-member committee Thursday to hear
evidence after the lawmakers firmly refused to drop 16 of the 17
impeachment articles against the 52-year-old Hastings, the first
black federal judge in Florida history.
   Earlier, the Senate deliberated for 2{ hours behind closed doors
and then voted 93-0 against dismissal of an article accusing
Hastings of perjury at the 1983 trial that ended in his acquittal of
charges that he conspired to obtain the payoff.
   The Senate voted 92-1 against dismissal of the first 15 articles,
which accused him of plotting with a Washington attorney to take the
bribe.
   Hastings did not seek dismissal of an unrelated article accusing
him of disclosing information obtained from a wiretap and thus
wrecking a federal investigation of Miami-area corruption.
   Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, was the only senator to vote
for dismissal of the first 15 articles.
   Metzenbaum press secretary Nancy Coffey said the senator believed
it might be unconstitutional to hold an impeachment trial on the
conspiracy charges when Hastings already had been acquitted of them
by a jury.
   ``The senator had constitutional concerns about double
jeopardy,'' Coffey said.
   The double jeopardy argument was the spearhead of Hastings'
defense when he took the Senate floor in a personal appeal to the
lawmakers for dismissal of the charges.
   ``I proclaimed my innocence then as I have from the outset and as
I do now,'' Hastings declared.
   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, one of several prosecutors from the
House of Representatives, scoffed at the judge's claim that double
jeopardy protection applies to an impeachment trial. He urged the
senators to remove Hastings from the bench and shut off his $89,500
annual salary because of ``his inexcusable breaches of the public
trust.''
   Evidence now is to be presented to the 12-member committee and
videotaped for the benefit of senators too busy to attend the weeks
of sessions that are expected in the case. Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, scheduled an organizational meeting for the panel
today.
   Once the evidence has been heard, the matter then will be
returned to the Senate floor for a final decision.
   Members of the panel are: Sens. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M.; Patrick J.
Leahy, D-Vt.; Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.; David Pryor, D-Ark.; Bob
Kerrey, D-Neb.; Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev.; Arlen Specter, R-Pa.;
David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Warren Rudman, R-N.H.; Slade Gorton,
R-Wash.; Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., and Conrad Burns, R-Mont.
   It appeared clear that the committee would have to slog through
weeks of testimony and tactical maneuvering before coming up with
its final report.
   The articles of impeachment say Hastings conspired with
Washington attorney William Borders in 1981 to reduce the punishment
of two brothers, Frank and Tom Romano of Miami, from three-year
prison sentences to probation. They had been convicted in Hastings'
court of skimming from a Teamsters pension fund loan.
   In return, Hastings and Borders allegedly were to receive
$150,000.
   The Romano brothers, both of whom have since died, refused to pay
any bribe, but the FBI mounted a sting-type operation and arrested
Borders pulling out of a suburban Virginia motel with a garment bag
containing $125,000 handed to him by an undercover agent
masquerading as Frank Romano.
   Borders was convicted in a separate trial of conspiracy and went
to prison. The House voted the articles of impeachment against
Hastings on a 413-3 vote Aug. 3.

<TEXT>
   Cambodia's pro-Vietnamese government has
freed 167 Thai fishermen caught poaching in its waters, officials
said.
   As a result of years of uncontrolled exploitation, most of Thai's
marine resources have been depleted so its huge fleet often fishes
illegally in neighboring countries' waters.
   Thai officials said the Cambodians later today also plan to
release 91 Thais who illegally crossed into Cambodia to mine for
sapphires and rubies.
   The fishermen, accompanied by several Thai legislators, returned
Thursday to eastern Trat province aboard a Cambodian trawler, an
official in the Prime Minister's office said. The official said the
fishermen were arrested several months ago in southern Kompongsom
province.
   Thai officials say about 300 other Thais, mostly fishermen, are
believed still held in Cambodian jails. Securing their release is
difficult because Thailand does not recognize the government there,
but relations have improved since the January visit of Cambodian
Prime Minister Hun Sen to Bangkok.
   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in late 1978 and Thailand backs
guerrillas fighting the Vietnamese.

   If Thomas Pickering writes to the home office
that he likes the work but he can never keep straight the names of
all those little countries, the boss might say he understands.
   That's because the home office is the White House, the boss is
George Bush and Pickering, like several other officials, is holding
a job the president once had in his previous incarnations.
   So that means if James R. Lilley cables from Beijing that he
enjoys the job but sure would like to sink his teeth into an
old-fashioned ham and cheese on rye, Bush might nod that he knows
just what Lilley means.
   And if William H. Webster says the work is fine, but there is
something just a bit spooky about headquarters, Bush might reply he
knows that feeling too.
   With Bush's selection this week of Lilley as ambassador to China,
the president has now filled all the jobs he was appointed to in his
long climb to the top.
   Pickering, Lilley, Webster and two other gents _ Lee Atwater and
Dan Quayle _ might collectively be called George Bush's George
Bushes. What they all have in common is that they're white men who
spent most of their lives in government or politics:

   UNITED NATIONS AMBASSADOR _ At 57, career diplomat Pickering is
10 years older than Bush was in 1971 when President Nixon gave the
former Texas congressman his first major post in government, as U.N.
ambassador.
   Pickering's 29-year career was free of even a hint of controversy
until he acknowledged in congressional testimony that he played a
role in the Iran-Contra affair. He helped arrange a secret
million-dollar donation of military equipment to the Nicaraguan
rebels after Congress banned aid to the Contras.
   Like Yaleman Bush, Pickering went to college in New England, in
his case Bowdoin College in Maine.

   REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CHAIRMAN _ Political gut fighter Lee Atwater,
37, bears scant resemblance to the 48-year-old George Bush who
headed the GOP during Richard Nixon's downfall.
   Atwater, a South Carolinian, is a political animal to the core, a
veteran of 30 local, state and national campaigns. His specialty is
negative campaigning. He once put it, ``You had to make the case
that the other guy, the other candidate, is a bad guy.''
   Bush in 1973-74 was a caretaker GOP chairman who tried to keep
the party afloat during Watergate and Nixon's resignation.
   Atwater masterminded the Bush campaign's attack against Democrat
Michael Dukakis, using the pledge of allegiance and the prison
furlough of a black murderer to portray Dukakis as out of line with
mainstream American values.

intelligence officer.
   They also had Yale in common. Lilley graduated in 1951, three
years after Bush.
   Lilley, 61, was born in China, where his father represented
Standard Oil. A former CIA intelligence officer, he has been U.S.
ambassador to South Korea and has served in U.S. missions in the
Philippines, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Hong Kong, on the
National Security Council staff, in the Pentagon and the State
Department.

   DIRECTOR OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE _ Webster, 65, was named CIA
director by President Reagan and was kept on by Bush, who ran the
CIA in 1974-75.
   Before that, Webster headed the FBI. Just as Bush helped the CIA
recover from revelations of agency misdeeds, Webster restored morale
at the FBI at a time high-ranking officials stood accused of
violating the rights of citizens.
   A former federal judge in his native St. Louis, Webster, like
Bush, is an old Navy man, loves tennis and went to college in New
England: Amherst on a scholarship.

   VICE PRESIDENT _ Dan Quayle, 42, had none of Bush's credentials
when Bush stunned Republicans at their New Orleans convention last
July by picking him for the job Bush then held, the vice presidency.
   Quayle was a junior senator from Indiana whose National Guard
service during the Vietnam War raised the suggestion that he used
family pull to avoid eligibility for the draft.
   Like Bush, Quayle had roots in a world of wealth and power, but
he lacked Bush's impressive resume, his distinguished college degree
or his record as a war hero.

<TEXT>
   A bill to shield federal employees who expose
waste, fraud and abuse is moving again toward enactment with
presidential backing after an earlier version was vetoed in the
final days of the Reagan administration.
   ``There is no more effective way for us to fight waste and
mismanagement in the federal government,'' Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.,
the chief sponsor, said Thursday before the Senate approved the
measure 97-0.
   The bill, backed by the Bush administration, appears to have
excellent prospects in the House, where action could come as early
as Tuesday.
   Under the bill, an independent special counsel's office would be
set up to protect federal employees, including whistle-blowers. The
office is now part of the Merit Systems Protection Board, which
enforces the civil service laws.
   Under the measure, it would be easier for federal employees to
prove that their firing or demotion came in retaliation for
whistle-blowing, and there would be additional guarantees of
confidentiality.
   The measure would permit employees to take their cases directly
to the Merit Systems Protection Board if the special counsel did not
do so within 120 days. The board could issue orders protecting the
employees from harassment during an investigation.
   The bill passed both houses unanimously last year and lawmakers
assumed that it was assured of then-President Reagan's signature.
But in October, Reagan killed it with a pocket veto, setting off
what Levin called ``a torrent of displeasure on a bipartisan basis''
among lawmakers.
   When Congress is out of session, the president can kill a measure
by simply refusing to sign it.
   The Reagan administration said last fall that the bill could have
resulted in government agencies filing suit against each other and
that it weighted the system too heavily in favor of the employees.
   A compromise was reached between the Bush administration and
senators last week under which the lawmakers agreed to drop a
provision enabling the special counsel to go to court on behalf of
whistle-blowers.
   Under the compromise, new safeguards were built into the bill.
For example, the special counsel would be barred from intervening
against an employee in a whistle-blower case.
   Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, told the Senate that rank-and-file
federal workers ``are the ones who can best tell us that there is
waste, fraud, mismanagement and abuse ... and yet they are perhaps
the least protected of the federal employees.''
   ``Our bureaucracy has a very peculiar way of rewarding
whistle-blowers,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. ``They are
harassed, they are demoted, they are even fired for doing what they
believe is right.''
   ``This bill when it becomes law will help restore the confidence
of the American people in their government,'' said Sen. Joe
Lieberman, D-Conn.
   The whistle-blower issue came into the spotlight in 1969 with the
dismissal of Defense Department aide A. Ernest Fitzgerald for
exposing $2 billion in cost overruns in the C-5A cargo plane
program. He was reinstated after a 13-year court fight.
   About 2,000 more obscure cases have been handled by the special
counsel's office over the last decade. There are indications that
most federal employees aware of waste, fraud and abuse are silent
because of a fear that blowing the whistle would cost them their
jobs.
   Twenty-five percent of federal employees surveyed by the Merit
Systems Protection Board in 1983 said they knew of waste, fraud and
abuse but 70 percent of those said they were unwilling to discuss it.
   Levin's office also said that at most 5 percent of whistle-blower
cases reported to the special counsel's office currently make it
past the initial screening process.
   Levin cited a remark that often has been attributed to former
special counsel William O'Connor in reply to prospective
whistle-blowers: ``I'd say that unless you're in a position to
retire or are independently wealthy, don't do it. Don't put your
head up, because it will get blown off.''
   ``Federal employee whistle-blowers deserve better,'' Levin said.

<HEAD>Cesar Says He'll Return to Nicaragua, Angers Colleague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Nicaraguan Contra leader is shunning stated
rebel policy by announcing he will return to his homeland and join
the internal opposition to the Sandinista government.
   The announcement Thursday by Alfredo Cesar, one of seven members
of the rebel directorate, was assailed by Contra spokesman Bosco
Matamoros, who accused Cesar of undercutting resistance policies.
   ``Exile politics is over,'' said Cesar, a political moderate who
has been a member of the directorate since 1987 and once served the
Sandinistas as president of the Central Bank.
   Rebel leaders have not been inside Nicaragua since their peace
talks with the Sandinistas broke down last June. Cesar is believed
to be the first Contra leader to announce an intention to return
permanently to Nicaragua since the rebels were formed almost seven
years ago.
   There was no immediate State Department reaction to Cesar's
disclosure. He said, however, the department officials left the
impression at a Tuesday meeting with the rebels that any decision on
returning home was theirs to make and no one else's.
   Cesar, 37, told a small gathering of reporters he supports the
Bush administration's view that the Contras should be maintained as
a cohesive _ but nonbelligerent _ force until it is clear that the
Sandinistas plan to carry out their promise to hold a fair election
next February.
   If the process goes smoothly, Cesar said he expects that some of
the more than 10,000 Contra fighters stationed in camps in southern
Honduras may return in peace to their homeland by next fall.
   ``If we reach the month of October, we may well be into an
irreversible (democratic) process in Nicaragua,'' Cesar said.
   He said he tentatively plans to return to Nicaragua during the
second part of May, assuming that preliminary discussions between
the Sandinistas and the internal opposition provide strong evidence
of Sandinista intentions to create a genuinely pluralistic system.
   Matamoros said that the Contra position calls for tripartite
discussions among the Sandinistas, the internal opposition and the
Contras on the ground rules governing the election process.
   By deciding unilaterally to return, Cesar is undercutting
resistance policy, Matamoros said.
   The Contra leadership has long been plagued by factional strife
and Thursday's statements suggest that will be a continuing problem
for the rebels.
   Cesar said he has no intention of seeking the presidency himself.
He said he would recommend that all segments of the opposition rally
around a single national figure, preferably someone who is ``above
partisan politics.''
   As Cesar described it, conditions for a democratic outcome in
Nicaragua are riper than they have been in years.
   He said the emergence of a bipartisan policy toward Nicaragua
under President Bush has been a major plus, and there is a stronger
consensus on the issue between the United States and Latin America
than there was under the previous administration.
   A common thread in the consensus is the need for the Sandinistas
to adopt western-style democracy, he said
   Cesar added that growing economic deprivation in Nicaragua also
has contributed to Sandinista flexibility on political questions.
   He expressed confidence that Congress will approve a forthcoming
administration request for additional humanitarian aid for the
rebels. Officials have said the figure will be in the $40 million to
$50 million range, enough to sustain the rebels until election time.
   Some Democratic lawmakers want to use some of the money to
re-integrate the Contras back into Nicaragua over the short term but
Cesar said a majority opinion in Congress holds that the money
should be used solely for food and other humanitarian items.

   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev denies reports
that he opposes the pace and scope of President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's reforms and says the Soviet leader ``splendidly fulfills
his duties.''
   Ligachev, peppered with questions about the reputed rift, told
reporters Thursday that reports he has deep differences with
Gorbachev are meant to turn the Soviet leader against him.
   ``You've said I'm cast as the leader of moderate forces in the
Soviet Union,'' he said at his first Moscow news conference. ``Some
people come up with even more outspoken characterizations, like the
leader of conservative forces, etc.
   ``Well, I view those assertions as the indication of a desire to
pit Gorbachev against Ligachev, and to introduce division in our
ranks.''
   Ligachev, 68, is widely rumored among Soviets to be a
conservative counterweight to Gorbachev in their country's
leadership. Last year Gorbachev stripped Ligachev of the ideology
portfolio that customarily goes with being the Kremlin's No. 2.
   Since then, Soviet officials have said the Kremlin has no No. 2.
Ligachev, named chief of the Communist Party's new commission on
agriculture in September, appeared to confirm that when he told
reporters: ``I cannot say that I am the head of the leading path or
direction.''
   Ligachev also indicated he no longer presides over meetings of
the ruling Politburo when Gorbachev is away, as Soviet sources had
previously reported.
   ``So far, Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev splendidly fulfills his
duties: He goes abroad, he goes to other regions, and he presides
over other Politburo members, and we are very satisfied with that,''
he said.
   Ligachev and other high-ranking party officials met journalists
at the end of the Central Committee plenum that decreed major
changes in agricultural policy to ease and ultimately eliminate
protracted Soviet food shortages.
   It was an extraordinarily high-powered news conference by Moscow
standards. Ligachev; Vadim A. Medvedev, his successor as party
ideologue, and Viktor P. Nikonov sat together on the stage at the
Foreign Ministry's Press Center.
   Despite Gorbachev's drive for ``glasnost,'' or greater openness,
the workings of the party's top bodies are still wreathed in
secrecy. The news conference was the first opportunity for
Moscow-based journalists to quiz Ligachev.
   Often joking, Ligachev fielded questions about the party
leadership's decision to permit lifetime leasing of farmland and
other agrarian reforms _ and about his political views and relations
with Gorbachev.
   ``I can tell you we see eye to eye, and on major issues, we are
quite unanimous,'' the white-haired Ligachev said at one point. ``We
have good comradely relations, which are very characteristic of
relations inside our party.''
   He acknowledged differences of approach may exist between himself
and Gorbachev, but said he discussed them with Gorbachev behind
closed doors, and that he always backed decisions of the Politburo,
which by tradition are unanimous.
   ``If we do have differing views on practical methods and forms of
implementing this or that reform, we take it up before sessions of
the Politburo and have a wide-ranging discussion on the issue,''
said Ligachev, elevated to the Politburo in April 1985, a month
after Gorbachev became leader.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has indicted a U.S. Army
colonel who supervised military sales to El Salvador on charges of
taking $70,000 in bribes and a $4,722 watch from the head of an
armaments company.
   Col. Juan Lopez de la Cruz, who stationed at the U.S. Embassy in
San Salvador between 1982 and 1984, was named in a seven-count
indictment charging conspiracy, bribery, making false statements and
aiding and abetting the filing of false claims.
   The indictment, returned Thursday by a federal grand jury in
Alexandria, Va., accused Lopez of conspiring with Dennis J. Reese,
president of Springfield Armory, Inc., to defraud the foreign
military sales program operated by the Pentagon.
   Lopez is accused of soliciting and taking bribes totaling $70,000
from Reese in return for helping Springfield Armory complete the
sale of $3.7 million worth of firearms to the Salvadoran government.
   Efforts to reach Lopez for comment on the charges were
unsuccessful.
   As an advisor to the Salvadoran Military Group, Lopez recommended
to the Salvadoran government what types of weapons and supplies to
purchase from U.S. manufacturers under the program.
   After they were introduced in 1983, Lopez told Reese that he was
in a position to influence the type of weapons the Salvadorans would
purchase and could help get U.S. certification to complete the
transactions, the indictment said.
   Reese, who pleaded guilty last month to conspiracy and filing
false statements, also bought Lopez a $4,722 Rolex watch at the
colonel's request.
   In return for the bribes, Lopez is accused of signing documents
falsely stating that commissions were paid on the weapon sales in
according with regulations of the program.
   He is also accused of aiding and abetting Reese's filing with the
government of false claims to be reimbursed $94,600 for sales
commissions that were never actually paid.
   According to the indictment, Lopez and Reese arranged for false
commissions to be paid to two Salvadorans they designated as agents.
   Lopez told Reese to make out checks to the Salvadorans, who
cashed them and returned the money to Reese _ minus their fee.
   If found guilty of all seven counts, Lopez could be sentenced up
to 15 years for each of the two bribery charges and five years for
each of the five remaining counts.
   The bribery charges together would carry a fine of $210,000 while
the other charges carry fines of $250,000 apiece.

   Bob Michael threw back another shot of
Jameson's whiskey, wiped the excess from his stubbly chin with the
back of his hand and gazed at the rest of the ``illegals'' crowded
into the Shannon Lounge.
   Michael, a 40-year-old carpenter from County Waterford in the
Republic of Ireland, was too busy working today to partake in the
St. Patrick's Day festivities a 10-minute train ride away in New
York City.
   ``The Irish are workers,'' Michael said. ``That's all we want to
do _ work and have a few drinks at the end of the day.''
   But Michael is an illegal alien, one of the ``new Irish'' who hit
U.S. shores every year and never leave, even when their visas expire.
   The Irish government last year reported that high taxes and 17
percent unemployment had prompted an exodus of as many as 30,000
residents a year.
   ``That's the one reason all the way down the line,'' said the
Rev. Michael Walsh, pastor of Holy Angels Church in Trenton and a
native of Ireland's County Clare. ``Many parts of Ireland have had
over 20 percent unemployment. The Irish economy bottomed out 1{
years ago.''
   The number of illegal Irish in the United States is estimated at
150,000, with about half of them living on the East Coast.
   The Irish Immigration Reform Movement, an advocacy group for
undocumented Irish, estimates that 15,000 illegal Irish came here
just last year, settling mainly around New York and Boston.
   ``Most of them are enjoying themselves,'' said Pat Sloyan,
president of the New Jersey chapter of the Irish advocacy group.
``It's not that they're having a hard time. Some of them are buying
new houses and trucks. But it's the uncertainty of it.''
   In barroom talk, most say they make good wages, but add that they
have to pay their bills in cash and are afraid to return home
because the trip out of the United States could be one way.
   ``Obviously I would love to take a trip home and see the folks,
but there's a fear,'' Michael said. ``I got a phone call tonight for
a $12,000 job. But do I give up that opportunity for folks and
family? No, I don't.''
   So many of them continue working ``off the books,'' as domestics
or in hotels and motels. Others find jobs in construction and are
attracted to the northeastern United States because of the
availability of work for skilled labor.
   Michael arrived here two years ago, quickly found a job and has
been working since.
   Down the bar, a ruddy 29-year-old construction worker said he
arrived from County Carlow three years ago. He, too, found work
right away and earns $20 an hour.
   ``Construction is nothing over there,'' he said of his homeland.
   Both Michael and his countryman say they are hounded daily by a
fear of discovery.
   ``We're not scared of paying our taxes, but we live with the fear
of walking outside and a cop saying, `Let's see your license,''' he
said.
   Cardinal John O'Connor of New York City ended a pilgrimage across
Ireland last summer by calling for the U.S. government to grant
amnesty for Irish and other illegal aliens in the United States.
   William Tillman, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service's Newark office, said that compared with the
roster of illegal immigrants in New Jersey, the Irish are a small
problem.
   Of the 31,000 people granted immigrant visas in New Jersey in
1987, only 274 were Irish, he said.
   And in Boston, where the population of illegal Irish immigrants
is estimated at 15,000 to 25,000 people, about 4,700 of the 10,000
visas issued since 1986 went to people from Ireland.
   Until March 31, the INS is accepting visa applications for a
lottery that will distribute 20,000 immigrant visas over two years
to people from 162 countries, including Ireland.

   Authorities added extra guards and searched
more than 1,600 aliens denied political asylum for weapons following
a disturbance at a detention center where detainees threw rocks and
ripped up a fence.
   Border Patrol sector chief Silvestre Reyes said 70 additional
border patrol agents were brought in, bringing the border patrol
force to about 130, and 15 to 20 uniformed immigration officers also
were called to the scene Thursday.
   ``We're concerned about the possibility that this may reoccur,''
Reyes said.
   INS officials said 1,621 detainees were in the outdoor recreation
area Thursday afternoon when about 200 Central American immigrants
demanded their freedom.
   ``They were throwing rocks, shaking the fence and some of them
ripped part of the fence up,'' said Omer Sewell, Immigration and
Naturalization Service dicstric director.
   Riot police formed a line 20 feet outside the row of double
fencing as the detainees chanted in Spanish, ``We want freedom,''
and, ``The people united will never be defeated.''
   ``There was no attempt at any hostages, no injuries, no leaders,
no demands,'' said Mario Ortiz, INS regional public affairs director
in Dallas. ``They just became agitated. We were able to push them
back and to get them back from the fence.''
   Reyes said ``nine potential ringleaders'' were being questioned.
   Civilian workers were sent out of the Port Isabel Service
Processing Center, located about 20 miles northeast of the border
city of Brownsville.
   ``I think they're trying to get the INS' attention, and I know
this is about the third time they've been trying to do this because
they have more than 2,000 people in there,'' said Brownsville
immigration attorney Linda Yanez.
   The detainee population Thursday was 2,248, including some
staying in tents because dormitories have filled to capacity.
   U.S. Rep. Solomon Ortiz, whose district includes the center, said
the unrest will continue as more people are detained.
   ``As they increase and the more that they stay in detention, the
more problems they will have,'' Ortiz said.
   U.S. Rep. Bruce A. Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the House
Subcommittee on Immigration, Refugees and International Law, said
the demonstration was probably a minor incident, but could become
more volatile.
   ``People should be skeptical that merely detaining these people
is solving the problem,'' Morrison said.
   Detainees, awaiting immigration-court hearings, have complained
of high deportation bonds set by immigration officials, as well as
lack of food, showers and medical attention.
   Sewell said none of the complaints are justified.
   The detention center's population has increased more than
five-fold since Feb. 21, when the government began immediate
detention of political-asylum applicants whose cases are denied.
   The INS since that date also has stepped up enforcement on the
border and stopped releasing on their own recognizance undocumented
aliens who are apprehended at the southern tip of the state.
   More than 40,000 Central Americans have applied for political
asylum since last spring in southern Texas, the closest crossing
point from Central America.

   President Bush says any
restrictions on rapid-fire assault weapons must protect ``the rights
of the legitimate sportsman'' as well as the lives of the nation's
police officers.
   ``This problem isn't a problem just for the federal government,''
Bush said in a speech Thursday.
   His remarks reinforced the impression Bush has left in recent
weeks that he is opposed to a total ban on semiautomatic weapons and
will insist that any curbs are carefully defined.
   The assault weapons have become closely identified with drug
traffickers and the rash of violence and death in some of the
nation's biggest cities.
   A member of the National Rifle Association, Bush was outspoken
against tighter gun controls during last year's presidential
campaign.
   After a 28-hour trip to Texas and Colorado, Bush was returning
today to Washington, where his wife Barbara was awaiting the birth
of puppies by their springer spaniel, Millie.
   Explaining the first lady's absence during a brief stop in his
adopted home state, Bush told a Houston audience, ``I think her
priorities may be slightly askew but she doesn't.''
   In a shift of position, the administration announced Tuesday it
was banning, at least temporarily, imports of five models of
semiautomatic weapons. However, the decision did not affect the sale
of such weapons made in the United States.
   ``I do want to find a solution to the so-called AK-47 assault
weapon problem, one that protects the rights of the legitimate
sportsman, but also protects the lives of our police officers who
are laying their lives on the line for us every single day,'' Bush
said in an address in Houston before flying here for another speech.
The audience of upwards of 1,000 people applauded his remark.
   The NRA says the military assault rifles affected by the federal
import ban are no different intrinsically from semiautomatic arms
that are used for self-defense or legitimate sport. The NRA opposes
all gun control.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater, accompanying Bush
on the overnight trip, said the administration welcomed the move by
Colt Industries to suspend sales of its AR-15, a civilian version of
the M-16 infantry rifle.
   He said Bush ``thinks it's a reasonable move on their part.''
Asked if the president wanted other gun-makers to take similar
steps, Fitzwater said, ``We'll leave it where it stands.''
   After his brief remark on assault weapons, Bush quickly moved on
to other subjects, prodding Congress for fast action on his proposal
to rescue the savings and loan industry and saying that his
administration is not bogged down or adrift.
   ``In this kind of work, more is going on than meets the eye or
makes the headlines,'' Bush said. Saying he was trying to lay the
groundwork for the next century, Bush said, ``The proof will come
when we look back from the year 2000.''
   In a brief question and answer session, Bush said that ``profound
changes'' are underway both in the Soviet Union and China.
   Speaking about reforms championed by Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, Bush said, ``We've got a challenge facing the United
States. We've got to figure it out. We've got to measure Soviet
intentions and then move _ then come forward with proposals that
will enhance the peace for our kids and our grandkids.''
   In remarks in Colorado Springs, Bush focused on the theme of
education and discussed steps he has proposed to improve the
nation's school system.
   ``When it comes to our nation's future,'' Bush said, ``education
is the key. It's the best investment we can make.''

   Reporters doing the day-to-day jobs of covering
crime and corruption risk their lives just every bit as much as war
correspondents, according to the director of a worldwide survey of
attacks on the media.
   The worldwide survey by the Committee to Protect Journalists
found that 26 journalists were killed and at least one disappeared
in the line of duty last year. The group was founded in 1981 by a
group of U.S. reporters and editors.
   Overall, the group documented some 800 incidents of threats,
killings, injuries or other harassment of journalists last year,
executive director Anne Nelson said Thursday at a National Press
Club briefing.
   ``If you look at the world of journalism, there are people around
the world who are not just threatened, but who have been killed,''
she said.
   The Philippines appears to have become the most dangerous
workplace for local reporters, said Ms. Nelson, with five deaths
last year.
   War-torn Afghanistan was also listed among the most dangerous
locations with four deaths.
   Mexico and Colombia, where drug lords operate, each recorded four
fatalities among journalists last year, she said.
   Here is a list of journalists killed, or who disappeared, in the
line of duty last year, as listed in the committee's annual report:
   Afghanistan:
   _Aleksandr Sekretarev, photographer for the Soviet newspaper
Izvestia, killed in a rebel ambush of Soviet troops.
   _Irshad Ahmed, correspondent for the Pakistani newspaper The
Muslim, killed when troops fired on a group of rebels he was with.

   With a record murder rate and its two top local
officials under federal investigation, the nation's capital has had
its share of unwanted publicity lately. Now, senators have begun
talking openly about what local politicians fear most _ the
possibility that Congress will take control of city government.
   Citing the city's inability to stem drug-related killings, two
senators suggested Thursday that the District of Columbia's police
department be replaced with a federally controlled police force.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., blamed the city's crime wave on
``inept local government that doesn't understand what it's doing.''
   ``We can't have people killed and blood running on the streets
like some Third World capital,'' Rudman said, adding that if the
killing continues, he would consider taking ``a look at home rule,
at least the law enforcement aspect.''
   Those remarks, supported by Sen. Ernest Hollings D-S.C., troubled
city officials who are worried that home rule, the right to
self-governance city residents obtained in 1973, may be more
vulnerable now than ever before.
   ``If the federal government thinks it can do a better job of
stopping drugs from coming into the city, why can't they do a better
job of stopping drugs from entering the country?'' asked Mayor
Marion Barry Jr.
   City Council Chairman David Clarke said that while the drug
problem may require additional federal involvement, home rule should
not be violated.
   ``What problems there are in this city will be dealt with by the
people in 1990,'' the next scheduled mayoral and council election,
Clarke said. ``They ought to let the democratic process run its
course.''
   Another council member, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
went to what many consider the heart of the city's battles with
Congress:
   ``The problem is Barry, and they don't have the guts to go after
him, so they hit us on these other issues.''
   Barry, currently under federal investigation for his ties to a
drug suspect, has seen his _ and the city's _ support in Congress
plummet over the past several years.
   Last year, lawmakers forced the city to abolish or change
existing laws governing AIDS insurance, the rights of gay groups to
gather at Georgetown University and the city's residency requirement
for city workers. Had the city failed to change these laws, all or
part of its $2.8 billion budget would have been frozen.
   To make matters worse, Del. Walter Fauntroy, a civil rights
colleague of Barry's who is Washington's non-voting representative
in the House, is under federal investigation for his alleged
involvement in a payroll padding scheme in his Capitol Hill office.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is currently deciding whether to
appoint a special prosecutor to expand an FBI probe into allegations
that Fauntroy paid the son of a congressional colleague to work in
Washington, even though the employee _ Thomas John Savage, son of
Rep. Gus Savage, D-Ill., _ swore on Illinois election documents that
he was living in Chicago the entire time he was supposedly working
for Fauntroy.
   While the battles with Capitol Hill and the legal problems of
Fauntroy and Barry have preoccupied local leaders, the city's
spiraling crime rate has given the city another pressing problem.
   Through Thursday, 112 persons had been killed in the nation's
capital so far in 1989, more than twice the total at the same time
last year. For all of 1988, a record 372 persons were killed in the
streets of Washington.
   Barry, Police Chief Maurice T. Turner and other city leaders have
blamed the upsurge in murders on the arrival of crack, a highly
potent and addictive form of cocaine. A statistical study of city
homicides shows that about 60 percent are drug-related, and about 80
percent of those appear to be assassinations.
   The District of Columbia received limited self-governance from
Congress in 1973, but still must have its annual budget and all
legislation reviewed and approved by Congress.
   In addition, Fauntroy cannot vote on the House floor, and the
district has no representation in the Senate. District residents can
only elect a non-voting House delegate, their mayor, city council
and school board members.
   Under city law, Congress reserves the right to repeal any local
law or act, including part or all of the charter enacted by Congress
for the city.
   That's the clause of the charter most local politicians know best
and fear most, particularly when senators start talking about having
the federal government intervene in city affairs.

   Major U.S. Jewish groups are calling on Jews to
boycott meetings with Pope John Paul II because the Vatican has
failed to remove a convent from the site of the Nazi death camp at
Auschwitz
   The U.S. section of the World Jewish Congress, which represents
34 American groups, announced Thursday that it has adopted a
resolution that calls for WJC members in 70 countries to refrain
from meetings with the pope during his frequent travels.
   The resolution, adopted at a meeting of organization leaders in
New York, will be introduced at the May 7 meeting of the WJC's
International Executive in Montreal.
   The resolution said, ``The convent controversy is symptomatic of
a clear pattern by the Vatican to revise the history of the
Holocaust and the role of the church during that terrible period.''
Pope Pius XII has been widely criticized for failing to act or speak
out against the Nazis' murder of 6 million Jews during World War II.

   A controversial art exhibit in Chicago prompted
the Senate to approve a bill to bar placing the American flag on the
floor or on the ground.
   ``I don't know much about art, but I know desecration when I see
it,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said after the
bill he introduced was approved 97-0 on Thursday.
   The move was a response to an exhibit by a student at the School
of the Art Institute of Chicago in which an American flag was
displayed on the floor in a fashion that resulted in spectators
standing on it.
   Dole's bill would expand existing law against flag desecration to
include the words ``knowingly displayed ... on the floor or ground.''

<NOTE>Forest Service Say Sales From National Forests Netted $388 Million</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government made a $388.7 million profit on
timber sales in national forests during fiscal 1988 even though more
than two-thirds of the nation's 120 forests lost money on the sales.
   The Forest Service said Thursday that 74 national forests lost a
total of $53.7 million in the timber sales, while the other 46
forests logged $442.2 million in profits.
   Peter M. Emerson, chief economist and vice president for resource
planning and economics for the Wilderness Society, said the report
reinforces the society's view that the Forest Service's timber sales
program is an ``environmentally destructive federal boondoggle.''
   The Wilderness Society has been urging the Forest Service for
several years to halt timber sales in national forests where
expenses exceed revenue.

<TEXT>
   The rightist Arena party has
managed to bury its dark links to death squads beneath a slick,
public relations campaign that promises peace and prosperity.
   Whether coffee millionaire Alfredo Cristiani will face a runoff
with the second-place finisher in Sunday's presidential election
remains to be seen. But few doubt the Arena standard-bearer will end
up the next president.
   Arena has moved to the front of a seven-party pack with a flashy,
tightly organized campaign that projects a moderate, can-do image
and capitalizes on what may be the party's biggest advantage _ it is
not the incumbent.
   ``Many people will not vote so much for Arena as against the
Christian Democrats,'' said the Rev. Ignacio Martin Baro, head of
the Public Opinion Institute at the Central American University.
   The Christian Democratic contender, Fidel Chavez Mena, has been
hurt by public perception of President Jose Napoleon Duarte's
administration. Despite five years in power and more than $3 billion
in U.S. aid, living standards deteriorated.
   The party is seen as inept and corrupt and has been unable to
solve the nine-year civil war with the leftist Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front, which has left 70,000 dead, most of them
civilians.
   The third main contender is Guillermo Ungo, 57, who returned from
eight years of political exile to lead a coalition of leftist
parties called the Democratic Convergence.
   When Arena, known formally as the Republican Nationalist
Alliance, was born in 1981 it was closely identified with the
interests of the rich and conservative.
   But it has broadened its appeal and mastered the art of electoral
politics.
   Arena is promising war-weary Salvadorans the peace and prosperity
they so desperately want, and is doing it with a style and
organization even skeptics find impressive.
   ``In times of crisis, people turn to parties that show a great
deal of self assurance,'' Martin Baro said. ``I think Arena has been
successful in selling that kind of image.''
   Cristiani, 41, is the moderate face of Arena.
   The other side is party founder and ``maximum leader'' Roberto
D'Aubuisson, the charismatic former army major persistently accused
of sponsoring death squads. D'Aubuisson denies the charges.
   The two faces of Arena are most evident at rallies. D'Aubuisson,
who always accompanies Cristiani, is the one who stirs the crowd,
who lights the spark.
   An Arena rally is a tightly organized, high-energy affair. It has
the intensity of an evangelical tent revival or a high school pep
rally infused with conservative political fervor.
   Amid the bunting, bands and pom-pom girls, muscular young toughs
raise clenched fists, their voices rising to this refrain from the
party song:
   ``El Salvador will be the tomb where the Reds meet their end.''
   Arena has deftly applied the flashy gimmicks of successful U.S.
campaigns in a country where half the people cannot read and 40
percent are out of work. Radio and television are the staples.
   There are catchy party jingles. There are buttons, balloons and
funny hats. There are T-shirts and pom-pom girls, party pencils and
miles of red, white and blue bunting.
   Candidates and party workers appear in public like a winning ball
club, wearing sporty windbreakers and duckbilled party caps.
   ``Arena is going to win because people have confidence in it,''
construction worker Genaro Herrera predicted during a rally.
   Arena is promising jobs, houses, hospitals and schools through
what it calls ``capitalism for the masses.'' It wants to reduce the
government's role in the economy.
   ``We may be conservative, but we are the only party that has
defined the social problems of the country and offers a solution,''
Cristiani maintained in a recent interview.
   He said he will give the leftist rebels a choice: join the
political process or face an ``efficient, professional use of the
armed forces.''
   Some fear an Arena victory could mean more violence and deeper
polarization. Others are more optimistic.
   ``I think that as long as Arena can obtain their goals
peacefully, they will not resort to violence,'' Martin Baro said.
``I think they would be much more dangerous at present in the
opposition, losing the election.''

<HEAD>Anderson's Captivity Remembered in Vigils, Services and Ceremonies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Journalist Terry Anderson, in his fifth year as a prisoner of the
politics he once reported, is ``tired of being caged like an
animal,'' his sister said.
   ``Enough is enough. ... This cannot continue,'' Peggy Say said
Thursday at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., attended by members of
Congress, Anderson's colleagues and relatives of the hostages in
Beirut, Lebanon.
   The ceremony marked the four years Anderson, the chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held captive
and was one of many observances across the country. The anniversary
also included a congressional resolution calling for release of all
the hostages and a statement from President Bush expressing his
sympathy.
   Anderson, 41, the longest held of the American hostages, was
kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut by a group believed to be made
up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran.
   In Washington, the Senate, on a voice vote, said it ``condemns
all forms of hostage taking for whatever purposes by individuals,
groups or governments.''
   The Bush administration called Anderson's detention a ``criminal
act which serves no cause.''
   ``The president certainly is concerned about the hostages,'' said
Marlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, who was in Houston with the
president.
   The administration pledged to continue working for the release of
Anderson, but officials repeated their policy of not cutting deals
with the group believed to be holding the hostages.
   ``Marking these anniversaries is difficult for the families,''
but they serve to remind all Americans that their countrymen are
held in Lebanon, Fitzwater said.
   In Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's boyhood home, about 500 people wore
yellow ribbons, heard music written in Anderson's honor and sent
aloft hundreds of balloons to symbolize their hope that Anderson
will be freed soon.
   About 200 children from Irving Middle School released the
balloons as Jack LaVriha, chairman of the Free Terry Anderson
Committee, played a tape recording of ``We Want You Home Again.''
   The song, by Lorain native Richard Bacher, was written at
Christmas in Anderson's honor. Its lyrics, sung in the recording by
the Lorain High School choir, implores Anderson's captors to
``listen to our plea and send him home.''
   In Cadiz, Ky., an estimated 75 people attended a service at Mrs.
Say's church. She moved there from Batavia, N.Y., where her brother
also grew up.
   ``As long as one citizen is held hostage, our nation is held
hostage,'' said the Rev. Harold Skaggs, paster of Cadiz Baptist
Church. ``All freedom is diminished when one is held hostage.''
   Skaggs asked participants to keep wearing the yellow ribbons they
were given and to burn candles in their windows at home to express
hope that the hostages would be freed.
   In Belleview, Fla., Anderson's brother, John Anderson, organized
a candlelight vigil. ``We want to raise public awareness so that
people know they can use their voice and let government know what
they want,'' Anderson said.
   Anderson's cousin, Rusty Ruth, organized a vigil in San Jose,
Calif., that about 100 people attended.
   ``I cry a lot,'' she said. ``I don't cry publicly, but I do cry a
lot. I wonder why we have such a hard time communicating with our
government.''
   At the Washington ceremony, fellow journalists joined in the
demand for Anderson's release.
   ``Our hearts cry out in protest'' over Anderson's plight, said
Louis D. Boccardi, president of the AP.
   ``It's time for those holding Terry Anderson to release him and
to end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man. Each of us
in our own special way should mark this day with contemplation and
prayer for Terry's release,'' Boccardi said in a statement sent to
the AP's staff.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based group,
called on Bush to use ``every means at his disposal to bring Terry
Anderson home.''
   Colleagues who knew and worked with Anderson talked of his
dedication to his job, his desire to tell the story of the war-torn
nation and his willingness to take risks.
   ``He has paid an awful price these last four years,'' said David
Ignatius, an associate editor of The Washington Post.
   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former hostage held for a time
with Anderson, said that before his own release on July 26, 1986, he
promised the journalist ``that I would never forget him, that others
would never forget him.''

   A U.S. Marine helicopter crashed today
in a rice paddy on the east coast during joint exercises with South
Korean forces, killing all four crewmen aboard, the U.S. military
said.
   The CH-46 helicopter went down near Toksok-Ri while taking part
in annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises, a U.S. military statement said.
No one was reported injured on the ground.
   The statement said the cause of the crash was unknown.
   The identities of the dead crewmen were withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   The helicopter was assigned to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit
based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., the statement said. The
troop-transport helicopter had been operating from the Marine
assault ship the U.S.S. Belleau Wood.
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in the
maneuvers to practice bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the event
of an attack by communist North Korea.
   The United States keeps about 42,000 troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Lasers Shrink Facial Tumor On British Toddler</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A doctor used pioneering laser surgery to
remove an orange-sized tumor that disfigured the face of a British
toddler, almost covering her left eye.
   ``She's dressed up like an Egyptian mummy,'' said Brian Watling,
who sat by his daughter, Faye, after the operation Thursday at
Stanford University hospital. ``But the growth is gone. There's no
growth there anymore.''
   Faye, who turns 2 on March 24, had ``one of the most severe''
cases of the growth, called a hemangioma, that physicians had seen,
said Dr. David Apfelberg, who used a laser to cut away the bulk of
the tumor.
   She was in stable condition Thursday evening, wrapped in a
bandage covering her face.
   Apfelberg could not be reached for comment at the hospital early
today.
   The toddler will return to England within two weeks, but will
have to come back to the United States for reconstructive surgery on
her face, Watling said.
   ``I don't think she understands too well,'' Watling said. ``All
she knows is that any time someone in white comes near her, it
hurts.''
   The tumor began as a small birthmark on Faye's left cheek and
grew so large so fast that Watling and the child's mother, Jayne,
feared they would wake her in the morning and find the deformity
covering her entire face.
   The Watlings said doctors in the Skelmersdale, England, area
where they live said surgery would have to wait until Faye turned 7,
a delay that put Faye in danger of losing the sight in her left eye.
   When the family learned the unusual surgery was being performed
in similar cases with children at the famed Palo Alto Medical
Clinic, they found hope for their daughter.
   A series of heartwarming, albeit wacky, fund-raising stunts on
Faye's behalf provided the $425,000 needed for the operation.
   British sailors in the Atlantic chipped in, women shaved their
heads in exchange for donations and inmates in a local prison played
24-hour badminton games.
   ``If people hadn't been so generous,'' said Watling, ``there was
no possibility of us coming here.''
   About one in every 500 to 800 children have some form of
birthmark, Apfelberg said, although 90 percent of the birthmarks
disappear by the age of 6 to 8. The cause is unknown, he said,
although it probably occurs during the first three months of
pregancy when a fetus develops its facial features.

<TEXT>
   The majority of accidental poisoning deaths in the
United States do not involve children eating drain cleaner or floor
wax. Those dying are older people, young adults for the most part,
and the cause of death is drugs.
   The national Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that 5,740
unintentional poisoning deaths were reported in 1986, the latest
year for which statistics are available _ a jump of more than 1,000
from the 4,331 reported in 1980.
   The CDC said the trend is apparently due to an ``increase in the
rate of deaths from drug poisoning.''
   While 2,492, or 58 percent, of 1980's 4,331 accidental poisoning
deaths were because of drugs, by 1986 that figure had jumped to 73
percent, or 4,187 out of 5,740.
   Over the same period, other poisoning deaths went down. The
number of accidental poisoning deaths from non-drug solids and
liquids fell from 597 to 544, and fatal accidental gas poisonings
fell from 1,242 to 1,009.
   The types of drugs most commonly involved in poisoning deaths are
opiates, such as heroin, and related narcotics, accounting for 930
accidental deaths in 1986, and cocaine and similar drugs, which
accounted for 624.
   ``This places in perspective the role of unintentional drug
poisonings, relative to other types of poisonings,'' said Dr. Daniel
Pollock, a researcher with the CDC.
   Unintentional poisoning deaths affect males more than twice as
often as females _ 4,105 to 1,605 in 1986 _ with the highest rates
in the 20-39 age group.
   While anti-drug programs remain appropriate for groups of young
people, ``the recent increase in unintentional drug poisoning deaths
among young adults underscores the need for drug education and
treatment (programs) that focus on illicit drug users who are
20-39,'' the CDC said.
   People may not think of drugs when they think of ``poisoning,''
Pollock said. Poison control efforts traditionally have ``focused on
childhood poisonings, particularly children under 5, the need for
safe packaging, the need for safe placement (of dangerous items).
That's still extremely important.
   ``But what the mortality data indicate is that poison deaths
among children have decreased, while deaths among young adults have
increased.''
   For example, in 1986, 93 children under 5 were killed in the
United States by unintentional poisonings, the CDC said. That was
down from 105 in 1980. But among people 20-29 the number rose from
1,222 in 1980 to 1,381 in 1986.

   The number of drug-related AIDS cases reported in
the United States nearly doubled last year, according to federal
health officials.
   The national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday that
10,747, or 33.3 percent, of the 32,311 AIDS cases reported in the
United States and its territories in 1988 were drug-related:
occurring among intravenous drug users, their sex partners or
children born to women in either of those groups.
   That's up from 26.9 percent a year earlier, when drug-related
cases accounted for 5,747 of the 21,356 U.S. AIDS cases reported,
said Dr. James Buehler, a CDC AIDS specialist.
   The Atlanta-based CDC noted that AIDS reporting _ including the
drug-related cases _ surged after mid-1987, when the agency adopted
a new definition for AIDS which counts more cases in their early
stages.
   That statistical adjustment is probably responsible for some of
the increase, but there apparently was also an actual increase in
drug-related cases, Buehler said.
   The number of drug-related cases increased 87 percent from 1987
to 1988, while the total number of AIDS cases increased by 51.3
percent. Both increases reflect, in part, the new definition and
reporting standards.
   The rate of drug-related AIDS cases ``continues to be higher for
blacks and Hispanics than for whites,'' the CDC said in its weekly
report. And although rates ``varied widely by area,'' 55 percent of
the nation's drug-related AIDS cases last year occurred in the
Northeast _ New England and the Middle Atlantic states _ where only
20 percent of the U.S. population lives.
   Drug-related AIDS cases made up 16 percent of all cases in
whites, 52 percent in blacks and 56 percent in Hispanics, the CDC
said. For all three of those racial-ethnic groups, the drug-related
AIDS rate was highest in the Northeast.
   Overall, homosexual and bisexual males continue to make up the
largest group of AIDS victims in the United States. Through Feb. 20,
a total of 87,188 cases had been reported, including 52,758 among
gay or bisexual men; 17,226 among intravenous drug abusers and
another 6,140 among gay males who were also intravenous drug abusers.

   If you are what you eat, kindergarten
and first-grade students at Central Elementary School in rural
Cabell County are as green as Ireland's old sod this St. Patrick's
Day.
   The school dished out green eggs and ham Thursday in a
celebration of the Irish holiday and Dr. Seuss' book, ``Green Eggs
and Ham.''
   Jessica Blank, 6, didn't seem to mind the color scheme of the
meal.
   ``I'd eat it anywhere,'' she said, repeating one of the lines in
the book.
   First-grade teacher Theresa Coleman thought it might be
interesting to bring the book by Theodore Seuss Geisel to life,
provided students were willing.
   The 27 students ate the colored scrambled eggs and chopped ham in
short order.
   Even green toast didn't dampen their appetites.
   In the book, a persistent character named Sam tries to get a cat
to eat green eggs and ham by offering every combination imaginable _
in a box, with a fox; in a house, with a mouse. Finally, the cat
tries the food to appease Sam, and finds he likes it.
   So did student Brandon Pauley _ ``in a house, with a mouse.''

   The secret will be safe with restaurant
owners who have stocked up on corned beef and cabbage for St.
Patrick's Day today: The dish isn't very Irish at all.
   Louise Gunning, a native of Dublin who works in the registrar's
office at Trinity College, said she's mystified by the fixation on
corned beef.
   ``I've been here two years and when I came here, I was very
surprised on St. Patrick's Day seeing all the places selling corned
beef and cabbage,'' she said. ``What I would regard as the national
dish is Irish stew (or) bacon and cabbage.''
   Kathleen McGrory, president of Hartford College for Women and a
specialist in Irish studies, suggested that a ``shrewd
Irish-American in a country that eats a lot of beef'' concocted the
corned beef tradition.
   ``Both my parents were from Ireland, and they told us when we
were very young, if we wished to be authentic, we would have boiled
ham and cabbage on St. Patrick's Day.''
   McGrory said she has generally honored that advice, but couldn't
resist the 99-cent special of corned beef, cabbage and green beer in
a Vermont pub last year.

   The ancient Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II was
neither black nor white, says Egypt's cultural emissary to the
United States, who is wondering how his country even got involved in
an American dispute over the question.
   Ramses II was strictly Egyptian, said Abdel-Latif Aboul-Ela, who
made the declaration on Thursday while bemoaning the need to do so.
   ``I wish people would not involve us in this kind of mess, which
we have nothing to do with,'' said Aboul-Ela, the director of
cultural office at Egypt's embassy.
   He was responding to complaints by black activists in Dallas, who
are demanding a greater emphasis on the pharaoh's African roots in a
``Ramses the Great'' exhibit on display at the Texas State
Fairgrounds.
   This perplexes Aboul-Ela, who frankly wants no part of U.S.
racial disputes.
   ``They should not use us ... involve us in this racial problem
that I thought was solved and buried a long time ago,'' the Egyptian
official said. ``We are not in any way related to the original black
Africans of the Deep South.''
   Ramses II, who ruled ancient Egypt for 68 years in the 12th
century B.C., was neither black nor white but Egyptian, he said.
``Egypt, of course, is a country in Africa, but this doesn't mean it
belongs to Africa at large. This is an Egyptian heritage, not an
African heritage.''
   His comments came after a group called the Blacology Speaking
Committee maintained at a Dallas news conference Wednesday that
Ramses II was black and threatened a boycott of the exhibit unless
organizers change their portrayal of the ancient ruler. They also
want more black involvement in the fairgrounds' operation.
   ``We are tired of people using our culture and history to make
money off us,'' said Dallas Jackson, a co-founder of the group.
   City Councilman Al Lipscomb said more blacks should be involved
in decision-making at the fairgrounds as well as running concessions
there.
   ``What we're saying is that the State Fairgrounds are in the womb
of the ghetto, in the heart of South Dallas, and it (the exhibit) is
making mega-millions of dollars,'' Lipscomb said. ``We're saying
leave something behind other than being a vacuum cleaner and sucking
it all up.''
   Lipscomb said it's not as though ``we're dealing with something
from Scandinavia or Ireland, we're dealing with something from
Africa.''
   Aboul-Ela doesn't quite see it that way, and offers two analogies:
   Although the United States' Constitution has its roots in
England, it isn't English, and although the Statue of Liberty was
made in France, it isn't French, he said.
   ``This is an Egyptian heritage and an Egyptian civilization 100
percent. We are part of the African continent. We cannot say by any
means we are black or white. We are Egyptian, with our culture and
traditions and religions,'' he said.
   ``It is really amazing to claim something like that,'' he said.
``It is just baseless.''
   The Ramses exhibit of art and artifacts, sponsored by the Dallas
Museum of Natural History Association, is expected to draw more than
700,000 visitors before it closes Aug. 27.

   A judge ruled doctors could remove up to
100 metal objects, including bedsprings and razor blades, from the
stomach of a suicidal prison inmate who had swallowed them.
   Reno County Judge Steven Becker ruled Thursday that doctors could
treat Kansas State Industrial Reformatory inmate Carl E. Rhoades
without Rhoades' consent.
   ``It was the first time I had heard of something like this,''
Becker said. ``I know there have been cases in the past where an
inmate has been on a hunger strike and goes into medical difficulty,
but not this.''
   Doctors said the 32-year-old Rhoades on Saturday swallowed what
appeared on X-rays to be 3 inch-long bedsprings, razor blades and
other unidentified metal.
   Rhoades is serving a 10- to 20-year prison term on aggravated
battery, marijuana possession and methamphetamine possession
convictions.
   Rhoades was admitted Sunday to Hutchinson Hospital but refused
treatment, prompting doctors and prison officials to seek the court
order.

   Communist rebels have seized
thousands of acres of land and are distributing them to poor farmers
in what the military says is a bid to discredit the government's
fledgling land reform program.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told the Cabinet in December that
the New People's Army had seized 76,500 acres nationwide and was
distributing them to landless farmers.
   Ramos described the rebel program as ``a critical problem'' aimed
at making the land reform program of President Corazon Aquino look
bad.
   The program, enacted by Congress last July, calls for buying land
from owners and redistributing them over 10 years to about 2 million
landless farmers at a cost of $7.3 billion.
   Officials say the Aquino government has already redistributed
about 326,000 acres.
   Frank Fernandez, local chairman of the rebel National Democratic
Front, claimed the guerrillas had distributed nearly 30,000 acres in
this Negros island town the past five years.
   Fernandez also claimed rebels had seized and distributed about
111,150 acres throughout the central Visayas islands, which includes
Negros.
   Land reform is widely seen as vital to curbing the largely rural
communist insurgency, now in its 21st year. Nowhere is the need so
acute as on this sugar cane-growing island, where two-thirds of the
3 million people live in the countryside, often in abject poverty.
   Under the government program, sugar cane lands will be among the
last to be redistributed.
   Sol Altatierra, regional spokesman for the Communist Party of the
Philippines, said guerrillas take over abandoned tracts or drive off
landlords with the help of the National Peasants Movement, a Marxist
farmers' organization and one of 12 groups in the
Communist-dominated National Democratic Front.
   ``We are determined to develop and modernize agriculture in the
rural areas bu putting up cooperatives and creating communal and
state farms, which is the essence of the socialist revolution in the
countryside,'' Altatierra said.
   Those receiving lands include families of guerrillas killed in
battle and members of the Movement. Recipients of prime farmland,
mostly irrigated rice fields, receive up to five acres.
   Farmers who select hilly tracts get about 12 acres. Those willing
to farm terraced, limestone hills suitable for growing coffee
receive up to 25 acres.
   In return, farmers must pay five to 10 percent of their net
annual income to the rebels. Fernandez said rebels reserve the right
to take back the land, presumably if the recipients failed to
cooperate.
   On Wednesday, Fernandez distributed ``titles'' to 216 farmers
during a festive ceremony attended by about 1,000 people at a
government school near this coastal town about 350 miles southeast
of Manila.
   Residents said graduation exercises had to be postponed because
of the rebel ceremony, held three miles from a military outpost.
   Armed guerrillas stood guard as the crowd watched skits depicting
rebels saving farmers from rapacious landlords. The program ended
with the singing of the Internationale, the Communist anthem.
   ``Your aspiration to own a piece of land is no longer a dream but
a reality,'' Fernandez told the celebrants. ``And your rightful
ownership will be made official by the National Democratic Front
acting on behalf of the people's revolutionary government by
distributing land title certificates.''
   Finance Secretary Vicente Jayme says the rebel program is bound
to fail because insurgents cannot provide credit, marketing help or
other expertise. Ramos has warned that titles bestowed by the rebels
are invalid.
   But a 49-year-old farmer named Rubio Laurente said he was proud
to receive a rebel title for lands he had already worked for 22
years.
   ``We have sacrificed for so long and yet the government has not
given us any land,'' said another recipient, Santiago Diego, 41.
``Now land has been given to me free, and I am very happy that the
land is mine.''

<HEAD>`Passive Smoking' Linked To Higher Risk of Cervical Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breathing the cigarette smoke of others may triple
a woman's likelihood of developing cervical cancer _ roughly the
same increase in risk that smoking itself seems to create, according
to a new study.
   But the finding should be interpreted cautiously, because the
study may have overestimated the risks of both types of exposure to
cigarette smoke, according to an independent researcher.
   Cervical cancer will strike more than 13,000 U.S. women this year
and kill 6,000 of them, according to the American Cancer Society.
   The most important cause of cervical cancer is believed to be
sexually transmitted virus called papillomavirus, but higher rates
of cervical cancer among smokers has led researchers to suspect that
cigarettes may play a role.
   Research has shown that substances in cigarette smoke can be
carried through the blood to distant tissues and organs, and these
substances have been detected in the neck of the uterus, the
researchers said.
   The study is the first to explore the possible role of ``passive
smoking,'' apart from active smoking, in the development of cervical
cancer, a malignancy of the neck of the uterus, the researchers said.
   Overall, women in the study who smoked had a 3.42 times greater
likelihood of developing cervical cancer than those who didn't,
according to findings published in today's Journal of the American
Medical Association.
   The amount the women smoked made little difference in their risk,
said the researchers, led by Martha L. Slattery, an assistant
professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of
Utah School of Medicine at Salt Lake City.
   Passive smokers _ non-smoking women who breathed the smoke from
others' cigarettes for at least three hours a day _ had a 3.43
greater likelihood of developing cervical cancer than other
non-smokers, the study found.
   Considered together, smokers and non-smokers who breathed other
people's smoke had a 2.96 greater likelihood of developing cervical
cancer than smokers and non-smokers who didn't breathe other
people's smoke, the study found.
   ``Passive smoking had its greatest effect on women who were
non-smokers,'' Ms. Slattery said in a telephone interview Thursday.
   Findings were based on data collected on 270 urban women with
cervical cancer in four Utah counties between 1984 and 1987, and a
``control group'' of similar women were chosen randomly to serve as
a comparison group.
   The researchers said Utah is a good place for such a study
because of the large number of Mormon women whose religion forbids
them to smoke, making them good subjects for collecting data on the
effects of passive smoking alone.
   All findings were statistically adjusted to correct for
differences in cervical cancer risk associated with differences in
age, number of sexual partners and other factors, the researchers
said.
   ``Because this is the first study that has really looked at
passive smoking and cervical cancer, the results should be
interpreted cautiously,'' Ms. Slattery acknowledged. ``They do need
to be replicated by other studies.''
   An editorial accompanying the study said a cause-and-effect
relationship between smoking and cervical cancer remains to be
shown, and the similar risks found for active and passive smoking
seem surprising.
   The editorial, by Dr. Peter M. Layde of Marshfield Medical
Research Foundation in Marshfield, Wis., said the study also
probably overestimated both types of risks.

<HEAD>Lawyers: Efforts To Free Soul Singer James Brown Could Hurt Probation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM STRONG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys for singer James Brown say
efforts from coast to coast to win early release from prison for the
``Godfather of Soul'' could hurt him at a probation hearing.
   ``Any kind of publicity hurts Mr. Brown with regard to his
criminal trouble,'' defense attorney Billy Weeks said. ``It might
help his record albums but it hurts him in court. It puts pressure
on the judge to be a little bit harsher.''
   The 55-year-old Brown, who is serving a six-year prison sentence
for trying to run over two police officers during a two-state chase
last fall, was scheduled to appear at a probation revocation hearing
today in state court in Aiken.
   Corrections officials requested the hearing after the Beech
Island resident allegedly tested positive for marijuana and PCP in
December. Brown was put on probation after his conviction last July
for resisting arrest and carrying a pistol; random drug testing is
one probation provision.
   He has been incarcerated at the State Park Correctional Institute
near Columbia since Dec. 29 after his conviction stemming from an
unrelated wild car chase with authorities from South Carolina and
Georgia on Sept. 24.
   Jesse Jackson has urged compassion for Brown, New York activist
Al Sharpton vows nationwide rallies on May 3 _ Brown's 56th birthday
_ to draw attention to the soul singer's plight, and a record by a
Los Angeles songwriter-producer team proclaims: ``Free James Brown,
the man has too much soul.''
   The free-Brown fight even went galactic this week after NASA's
Mission Control in Houston awakened the space shuttle Discovery's
five astronauts with shouts of ``I Feel Good'' from Brown's smash
1960s hit, ``I Got You (I Feel Good).''
   ``In a strange way, I think the fact that James Brown is now in
outer space ... simply heightens the case to a global awareness,''
Jackson said in a telephone interview. Jackson appeared before the
state parole board on Brown's behalf on March 8.
   The campaign, however, has not persuaded South Carolina
corrections officials to move up Brown's parole eligibility date
from May 12, 1991.
   Brown, who works as a kitchen aide at the state prison and sings
with the choir in his spare time, did not respond to a letter from
The Associated Press requesting an interview.
   Despite his legal problems, Brown's career is hardly faltering.
   An album he recorded in December with Aretha Franklin is to be
released soon and Cinemax is broadcasting Brown's November concert
tour in Italy.
   Brown's album, ``I'm Real,'' released in August, also is selling
well, said Johnny Musso, president of Scotti Brothers, Brown's Santa
Monica, Calif., record label.
   ``We don't think this (Brown's conviction) has hurt him at all,''
Musso said.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister: Talks With PLO Sympathizers May Be OK</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER ALAN HARPER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens said his
country was willing to consider talking peace with ``authentic
interlocutors'' from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, even if they turn
out to be Palestine Liberation Organization sympathizers.
   Arens, a member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing
Likud bloc, told the Conference of Presidents of Major American
Jewish Organizations Thursday that Israel would ``spare no effort to
identify interlocutors amongst the Palestinian population'' in the
occupied territories.
   ``And it may very well be that such authentic interlocutors, some
of them may end up being sympathizers of the PLO,'' he said. ``But
there is a world of difference between somebody who has a
constituency, somebody who has to respond to that constituency on
the ground, or somebody who gets his orders from Tunis and knows
he's going to get a bullet in the head if he doesn't follow his
orders.''
   Arens statement was considered a significant departure from the
Likud line, which has been to rule out talks with anyone connected
in any way to the PLO.
   However, Yossi Ahimeir, a spokesman for Shamir in Jerusalem, told
The Associated Press that that position had not changed.
   ``We will never talk to people who are affiliated, who are
connected with the PLO. Sympathizers is a vague term. There are even
many PLO sympathizers among Israelis,'' Ahimeir said.
   Arens said that once the government found Palestinian
representatives ``that we can talk to, we will try to protect them
from threats, from terrorism.
   ``We will try to create a situation where their lives will not be
in danger. It's going to take courage on their part as well. That's
part of their contribution.''
   Arens, who met with President Bush and other officials in
Washington earlier this week, also strongly denounced the PLO and
its leader Yasser Arafat, and chastised members of the Israeli
parliament for going abroad to mobilize support for direct talks
with the organization.
   His meetings were preceded this weekend by a conference at
Columbia University where Palestinians, including members of the
PLO, met with Israelis, including Knesset members, to encourage
dialogue.
   ``I'm not helped by the appearance of Israeli members of the
Knesset here in New York with PLO,'' he said. ``Don't take that
argument abroad. Don't try to circumvent the decision of Israel's
electorate by going to New York or Stockholm, by trying to put
pressure on Israel's government via other governments.''

   Prosecutors say they have a strong case
against a police officer acquitted last summer of sexually abusing
an 8-year-old girl _ a videotape of the officer having sex with the
same girl.
   Warren A. Poole, 45, was acquitted by a judge last June when the
girl, placed on the witness stand in front of the defendant,
recanted her claim of sexual abuse.
   Several months later, however, police said the girl again told
them she had been molested. State and local police searched Poole's
apartment Wednesday and confiscated a videotape that prosecutors
said shows the policeman having sex with the girl. He was charged
with raping the child.
   Poole, who was suspended without pay, pleaded innocent at his
arraignment Thursday in Lynn District Court. Bail was set at
$350,000 with double surety, meaning Poole must put up bonds worth
at least $700,000 to secure his release.
   Assistant District Attorney Howard Whitehead said that the
videotape gave the prosecution a ``uniquely strong'' case.
   Poole's attorney, Alan Karahalis, did not respond to telephone
messages requesting comment.
   Poole, a divorced father of six, has served for 14 years on the
police force in Lynn, a industrial city of 78,500 people about 15
miles north of Boston.
   Poole was reinstated to the police department with back pay after
his acquital.

   A U.S. soldier was being held on
espionage charges today after he allegedly supplied East Germany
with secret U.S. plans for defending against a communist invasion,
the Army said.
   The Army said East German officials told U.S. military
authorities that Spec. 4 Michael A. Peri had contacted them during
the soldier's mysterious 11-day disappearance.
   Peri vanished on Feb. 21 from his unit near the East German
border, taking with him a portable computer that belonged to the
unit. Peri, who worked as an electronics warfare specialist, turned
himself in 11 days later.
   On Thursday, the Army said that the 21-year-old soldier from
Laguna Niguel, California, had been charged with espionage.
   Peri, who was in confinement in Mannheim, West Germany, already
had been charged with being absent without leave and other offenses.
No date has been set for his trial.
   Lt. Col. Jake Dye, spokesman for the U.S. Army 5th Corps, said
Peri was considered a ``pretty decent soldier.''
   ``This surprised a lot of people,'' he said.
   Dye said Peri gave the East Germans information on the unit's
``general defense plan,'' but he did not elaborate.
   Peri was assigned to the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, which
provides a front-line defense for West Germany's border with East
Germany. The unit, based in Fulda about 65 miles northeast of
Frankfurt, includes tanks, armored personnel carriers, and armed
troops.
   Peri operated equipment that detects enemy radar and other
signals. He has been stationed in West Germany since March 1988.
   NATO forces are stationed in the area to defend the West German
border against any attack by Soviet bloc armies.
   In a statement, the 5th Corps said Peri ``has been charged with
espionage _ communicating documents and@or information relating to
national defense to the German Democratic Republic.
   ``He was further charged with unlawfully having classified
information in his possession; removing classified documents from a
classified document storage area; moving classified documents to the
GDR and transfer of classified information to unauthorized
persons,'' it said.
   The statement provided no further details about the information
Peri allegedly handed over to the East Germans, and made no mention
of any money changing hands or his possible motive. It said no date
had been set for his trial.
   Maj. Samuel Taylor, another 5th Corps spokesman, said ``the
evidence we have that he crossed the border was given to us by the
GDR (East German) Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
   ``We were told by the (East German) ministry that Peri made
contact with them,'' Taylor said. He did not elaborate.
   A source at the Pentagon in Washington said Peri also may have
gone to Austria while he was missing.
   ``We now believe he left East Germany, went to Austria and then
back into West Germany to his unit. We know he once lived in Austria
before he joined the Army, but we really don't know exactly what's
going on here,'' the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Dye said he did not know exactly where Peri went inside East
Germany or how he crossed the heavily guarded border.
   Some news media reports had speculated that he defected because a
military vehicle he signed out was found Feb. 23 near the town of
Obersuhl, a remote rural area northeast of Fulda and near the East
German border.

   A slaying suspect surrendered early today to end a
three-hour standoff with police during which he held a gun to a
teen-ager's head, authorities said.
   Maxwell Thomas, 18, is a suspect in the slaying of hairdresser
David Timoner, 33. A second suspect, identified by police as
18-year-old Michael Diaz, remained at large.
   Timoner's body, found in a burning car Wednesday morning, was
charred beyond recognition. Dental records were used to identify him.
   During the standoff, neighboring houses in the Capitol Hill area
of Denver were evacuated and the block was cordoned off. The
hostage, Michael DeLoach, 17, was freed when Thomas surrendered.
   The arrest capped a search of the area that began when police
tried to arrest Thomas at his apartment on a murder warrant. Police
said Thomas pulled a gun and fled on foot.
   The hunt for Thomas included a two-hour search of Morey Middle
School with students locked in their classrooms while police looked
for the suspect.
   ``He was scared, a mixed up 18-year-old kid,'' said Lt. Curtis
Williams, who negotiated with Thomas during the standoff. ``He said
he didn't have anything to lose and wanted to go down in a blaze of
glory. ... Maybe he didn't want to go out in a blaze of glory after
all.''
   Williams said Thomas denied any involvement in the slaying.
   Police said they suspected a drug connection in the slaying, but
Timoner's friends said he did not use drugs.

   The state Supreme Court has refused to stop
the enforcement of local bans on semiautomatic assault rifles in
several California communities including Stockton, where a gunman
opened fire and killed five children.
   The court on Thursday also transferred several lawsuits, paid for
by the National Rifle Association, to the 1st District Court of
Appeal in San Francisco.
   The lawsuits contend that state law on gun registration and
licensing was intended to forbid local measures restricting gun
ownership.
   Police and gun-control groups have long been pushing for bans on
semiautomatic rifles, particularly in cities like Los Angeles, where
they are widely used by street gangs.
   Support for local and statewide restrictions gained momentum
after Patrick Purdy entered a Stockton elementary schoolyard on Jan.
17, and with rapid-fire shots from a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle,
killed five children and wounded 29 other pupils and a teacher
before taking his own life.
   Since then, the cities of Los Angeles, Berkeley, Stockton and the
county of Santa Clara have passed ordinances banning sale and
possession of the military-style weapons. It was enforcement of
those laws the state high court refused to block.
   Besides the four ordinances that were challenged in court, local
bans have been passed by the cities of Gardena, Compton and Carson
and are being considered elsewhere.
   The local ordinances in general forbid sale and possession of
assault weapons.
   The state Legislature has voted curbs on the sale and possession
of the weapons as of next Jan. 1.
   Colt Industries Inc. of Hartford, Conn., on Wednesday said it was
suspending sales to the public of its AR-15. The company said the
suspension was a voluntary reaction to the Bush administration's
temporary import ban on semiautomatics.

   One of President Corazon Aquino's
bodyguards shot and killed his wife and her lover when he caught
them in bed in a motel, officials said today.
   The shooting came a day after a mob stabbed and beat to death
another presidential guard who in a drunken rampage had wounded two
people by firing into a crowd, police said.
   Capt. Nestor Garnace apparently was spying on his wife and her
lover and burst into their room Thursday shortly after they checked
into a motel in the Manila suburb of Pasay City, police said.
   Police reported witnesses as saying they heard five shots.
   Garnace surrendered immediately and remained in custody pending
charges by the military, according to a Presidential Security Group
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Earlier Wednesday, Private 1st Class Ramil Villafranca began
firing at passers-by in a Manila neighborhood for no known reason.
   Angry residents grabbed knives, stones, and pipes and attacked
him, police said. He was stabbed, beaten and lynched, they said.

<HEAD>Teamsters Boss Wanted Mafia Help To Get Union Job, Court Papers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters asked the Mafia for help in his unsuccessful 1984 bid for
a high-level union position, according to government documents.
   The allegation is contained in the evidence the government
collected for a pretrial hearing in the Teamster racketeering trial
that was canceled Monday.
   The source of the allegation was Jackie Presser, the late
president of the Teamsters, who also was an undercover informer for
the FBI.
   In one of his reports, Presser said that William J. McCarthy
sought Mafia help to become secretary-treasurer _ the union's second
most powerful position.
   The position is supposed to be appointed by the president.
Presser, who was president at the time, told the FBI that he needed
Mafia approval to select anyone for the post, which then paid
$250,000 a year.
   Presser, who died last July and was succeeded by McCarthy, stated
that McCarthy had solicited support from the head of organized crime
families in New England and the New York area in 1984.
   Federal prosecutors have said that Presser's reports were
substantiated by court-approved wiretaps of Mafia leaders.
   McCarthy, speaking through James T. Grady, the union's general
counsel, denied the allegations, according to a report in today's
New York Times. In fact, Grady said that Presser had told McCarthy
to contact the ``wise guys'' if he wanted to be secretary-treasurer,
the Times said. ``Wise guys'' is used to refer to members of the
Mafia.
   McCarthy, 69, had led Teamsters Local 25 in Boston for 20 years
when he was elected president of the national union after Presser
died.
   The trial, which was set for Manhattan federal court, was
canceled after the Justice Department and the union agreed on a plan
that calls for court-appointed officers and an administrator to
oversee most of the union's business and rid it of alleged
corruption.
   Presser filed reports as an FBI informant from 1984 to 1985.
   Although the material was not used, the chief prosecutor in the
case, Randy M. Mastro, said the Presser reports could be used by the
court-appointed officers if necessary in future proceedings to
remove McCarthy and other union officers.

   Two men who dumped more than a ton
of old tires on a university campus became the first to receive
felony convictions under a tough, new Florida littering law.
   ``We're very pleased,'' said a spokesman for the Florida Game and
Fresh Water Fish Commission after a jury found Willie Hooks, 66, and
John W. Johnson, 45, guilty of littering Wednesday.
   ``This is a serious offense to the natural environment, and it
will send a message that this will not be tolerated,'' Jim Huffstodt
said.
   Under the new law _ which took effect Oct. 1 _ it is a felony to
dump more than 500 pounds of debris on public property.
   Hooks and Johnson testified at the trial they agreed to help Walt
``The Tire Man'' Baker dump 117 tires on Oct. 21 on the campus of
Florida Atlantic University to make a little extra cash. Baker also
was charged, but pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor in a plea bargain.
   Circuit Judge Thomas Sholts said he will probably sentence them
to community service _ picking up trash.
   Sentencing was set for May 8.

<HEAD>Arsonist Sets Fire To Building Where Journalist, Lawmaker Stay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities today blamed an underground group of
Jewish militants for arson attacks on the homes of a journalist and
a relative of a left-wing legislator.
   Both the columnist and the lawmaker have angered Jewish militants
because they talked to supporters of the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
   No one was reported injured in the Thursday night attacks, which
occurred at the same apartment building in Jerusalem.
   Police said a Jewish underground group that claimed
responsibility for two similar arson attacks last month was
responsible for the latest incidents.
   An arsonist set fire to the Jerusalem apartment doors of Dan
Margalit, a columnist for the Ha'aretz newspaper and a television
show host.
   At about the same time, an arsonist started a fire against a door
at the residence of Omer Shiloni, nephew of Knesset member Yair
Tsaban.
   It appeared the arsonist may have mistaken the apartment for that
of Tsaban's son, Dror, who also lives in the building. The lawmaker
stays there when he is in the city.
   An anonymous telephone caller contacted the mass-circulation
newspaper Yediot Ahronot and said the attacks were politically
motivated.
   He said his group, which he did not identify, targeted ``the
apartments of Dan Margalit and Yair Tsaban _ their names should be
erased from the face of the earth _ because Margalit invited Faisal
Husseini to appear on television and Tsaban met with the PLO
overseas.''
   Tsaban, whose left-wing Mapam party calls for talks with the PLO,
has participated in several international conferences alongside PLO
officials. Margalit had Husseini, a pro-PLO leader in the occupied
territories, on his TV show several weeks ago.
   Police attributed the attacks to an underground group called the
Sicarites after a Jewish movement that operated in Roman times. The
ancient Sicarites named themselves after ``sica'' daggers that they
carried to murder Jews who collaborated with Rome.

   Demolition crews making way for a museum
have begun tearing down buildings near the motel where the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr. was slain.
   The National Civil Rights Musuem will center on The Lorraine
Motel where King was gunned down by an assassin in 1968.
   Work crews are to remove seven small buildings and knock down a
wing of the motel, said Ernie Morin, a foreman on the demolition
project which began Thursday. He said the crew has 75 days to
complete the demolition.
   The museum is scheduled to open on July 4, 1991. The $8.8 million
project is financed by the state, city and county.
   The crumbling motel, located in a downtown district made up
largely of low-income housing and warehouses, has drawn thousands of
tourists since King's murder. The motel was closed last March.

<HEAD>Former Head Of Basque Government-In-Exile Dead At 92</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesus Maria de Leizaola, who headed
the Basque government-in-exile for nearly two decades during the
dictatorship of Gen. Francisco Franco, has died. He was 92.
   A statement by doctors at Guipuzcoa hospital in this Basque
provincial capital said Leizaola died at 11:30 p.m. Thursday, an
hour after he was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment
following a heart attack.
   Leizaola was a member of parliament under the democratic republic
that existed from 1931 to 1939. The Spanish Civil War broke out in
1936 and Franco's nationalist troops were victorious in 1939.
   Leizaola served as Basque justice and culture commissioner during
the war and went into exile in France in 1937.
   He became head the Basque autonomous government-in-exile in 1960.
Franco died in 1975 and Spain became a parliamentary monarchy.
Leizaola returned to Spain in 1979 and symbolically handed over
power of the regional government for northern Basque region.
   Leizaola was born Sept. 7, 1896, in San Sebastian, the Basque
capital.
   Leizaola had predicted before returning to Spain that the
re-establishment of a Basque autonomous government, which occurred
in 1979, would eliminate ETA, the separatist group that has claimed
responsibility for killing more than 600 people since it took up
arms in 1968.
   ``When full autonomy takes effect, ETA will disappear like a
tumor that cures itself spontaneously,'' he said in an interview in
Paris.
   He died as the government and ETA, which stands for Homeland and
Liberty in the Basque language, were holding negotiations in Algeria
to end the killing and two days before hundreds of thousands were
expected to march in the biggest peace demonstration in Basque
country's history.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<HEAD>Ambulance Crew Accused of Falling Asleep After Emergency Calls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ambulance crew received three
calls asking for emergency service for a heart attack victim and
went back to sleep after each call, according to a hospital
executive. The victim died.
   Clarence Cowden, 77, was dead when he arrived at the hospital
about an hour after his wife first called emergency services,
Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center vice president Pat Gouldy said
Thursday.
   Both paramedics, who were not identified, were fired after an
investigation of the Feb. 8 incident, Gouldy told the Grand Prairie
Ambulance Advisory Board.
   Board members appeared to be stunned as they listened to the
report at an emotional meeting attended by Cowden's two children.
   Cowden's son, Marvin, said his family was not seeking to punish
anyone, but ``Something has got to be done to make sure these people
are on the ball.''
   Gouldy said a 911 dispatcher received a call from Cowden's wife,
Thelma, at 3:14 a.m. The dispatcher called the ambulance crew driver
a minute later at a substation 1{ miles from Cowden's home in the
Dallas suburb.
   The dispatcher made two more calls when the crew did not announce
its departure on the radio. Both times a crew member answered the
telephone, but the ambulance did not move, Gouldy said.
   At 3:30 a.m., Gouldy said, an ambulance from another station was
dispatched. It arrived at the Cowden home at 3:35 a.m., 21 minutes
after the first call, he said.
   The driver did not recall taking the calls or hearing the
telephone ring, Gouldy said.
   ``We assume he (the ambulance driver) took the calls and fell
back asleep,'' Gouldy said.
   Officials said an investigation has not established whether
Cowden would have been saved if the ambulance arrived earlier.
   ``I find it absolutely appalling that you have let ambulance
service in Grand Prairie exist for six years with nothing more than
a telephone bell,'' said Lida Woodul, the victim's daughter. ``It
just frightens me to death that this has been allowed to exist.''
   Since the incident, Gouldy said, the ambulance service has
installed alarm bells in each station and has ordered pagers to be
issued to crew members.

   A strong earthquake rattled the southern
tip of this Aegean Sea island today but caused no damage or
injuries, authorities said.
   The quake, which measured 5.4 on the Richter scale, occurred this
morning about 240 miles southeast of Athens, according to the Athens
Seismological Institute.
   ``Some people felt the earth shake a bit, but no one was
worried,'' said a local police spokesman.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in populated
areas and a quake measuring 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas.

<HEAD>IRS Admits Internal Problems as Tax Deadline Nears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service, which has never
been bigger or busier, has its hands full of problems just one month
before the deadline for filing individual tax returns.
   The 110,000-employee agency expects to receive a record 109
million returns this year and insists it is fully prepared to
process them and issue refunds on time.
   ``Overall, the filing season is going smoothly,'' Michael J.
Murphy, the acting IRS commissioner told the House Ways and Means
oversight subcommittee on Thursday.
   But Murphy, who has been acting in the top job only two weeks,
and other senior IRS officials are putting in long hours dealing
with some major problems. They include:
   _Explaining why the 5,000 employees who are trained to answer
taxpayers' telephoned questions are giving the wrong answer at least
30 percent of the time. In some areas, the accuracy rate is barely
50 percent. ``Calling the IRS for tax advice is a real crap shoot,''
complains Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas, chairman of the House panel.
   ``Our accuracy rate is unacceptable,'' Murphy said. ``We will not
be satisfied until we see substantial improvement.''
   _Assertions that some IRS tax-return examiners were led to
believe they should keep quiet when they find taxpayers neglected to
subtract taxes withheld when they completed their returns. ``We were
actually stealing from the taxpayers,'' said one employee, who added
that in most such cases, the taxpayers _ often retirees _ lost
between $100 and $1,000 each.
   Murphy, testifying before the subcommittee, seemed to acknowledge
such a policy existed and was amended last December. He ordered an
investigation.
   _The IRS, which collects about $1 trillion a year, is strapped
for cash of its own. The Washington Post reported things are so
tight because of budget cuts that in some offices, pens have been
rationed and employee training has been reduced. The IRS budget for
this year was cut by $100 million and the agency then had to cut
other programs to finance a mandated employee pay raise.
   ``We have a management problem trying to conserve resources,''
Murphy said. ``We are looking for about $50 million'' to continue
operating at present levels for the next six months.
   He vowed, however, that the tightening will not force reductions
in taxpayer services, processing of returns, or law enforcement.
   _The agency still has trouble getting tax forms and publications
to taxpayers. The General Accounting Office visited 35 IRS offices
in 10 states to check on 79 documents each office was supposed
stock. No office had all 79; 15 officers were missing 10 or more
forms.
   The IRS sampled 32,000 mail orders for forms and found 96 percent
were processed correctly.
   _Although nationwide the IRS is 2.2 percent ahead of last year's
pace in processing tax returns, two of the 10 service centers _
Brookhaven, N.Y., and Kansas City _ are 11.4 percent and 10.2
percent, respectively, behind schedule. Brookhaven processes returns
from New Jersey, New York City and Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk and
Westchester counties in New York; Kansas City, from parts of the
Midwest.
   The IRS says these are temporary conditions that do not portend
major problems.
   But in all the bad news plaguing the IRS lately, there is one
bright spot. The GAO says taxpayers and the IRS are making fewer
errors completing and processing returns this year. Errors were made
on 15.8 percent of returns, compared with 18 percent last year, and
about six of every 10 were made by the taxpayer.
   ``IRS' analysis indicates that taxpayers are making many of the
same types of errors as last year, even though IRS attempted to
avoid some of those errors by changing the related forms or
instructions,'' GAO told the House panel.
   The most frequent errors: taking the wrong standard deduction,
erroneously computing or claiming the earned-income credit, and
figuring a refund wrong.

<TEXT>
   Hundreds of protesters battled riot
police at three colleges today after students stormed the
headquarters of the governing party and demanded the ouster of
President Roh Tae-woo, authorities said.
   Protesters threw firebombs and rocks during clashes in the
capital and police responded with tear gas. At least five students
were reported hurt.
   The protests broke out after about two dozen students stormed the
headquarters of the governing Democratic Justice Party in Seoul and
briefly occupied the roof and hurled firebombs at police.
   The protesters were overpowered and arrested by about 100 riot
police.
   Clashes later broke out at Seoul National, Dongguk and Kon Kuk
universities, with police involved in running battles with students
who hurled firebombs and rocks and shouted anti-Roh slogans.
   About 1,500 students were involved in the clashes.
   Police also reported an attack on a party office in eastern Seoul
by a dozen students Thursday night. Police said the students fled
after hurling firebombs and shattering windows.
   Some opposition and dissident groups are making a joint effort to
defeat Roh in an upcoming national referendum. Radical students vow
to stage a wave of anti-Roh street demonstrations prior to the
plebiscite, expected in mid-April.
   Roh told a meeting of senior government prosecutors today he
would soon call the referendum and that the government must take a
stand against radical groups espousing leftist revolution.
   Roh promised in a 1987 campaign to hold a referendum to let
people assess his performance. Government officials have said Roh
would stay in power even if he is defeated, but opponents contend
the president must resign if he fails to win a majority.
   Opposition leader Kim Young-sam today urged Roh to resign to
clear the way for a new presidential election. The head of the
second-largest opposition party, Reunification Democratic Party,
said he would step up a campaign to defeat Roh in the referendum.
   Meanwhile, Seoul's subway service remained disrupted for the
second straight day today as many striking workers ignored a warning
or return to work immediately or face dismissal or other
disciplinary action.
   About half the subway's 7,732 workers reported today, but many of
them refused to work. Subway officials said several days would be
needed before full service is restored.
   Police arrested about 2,300 strikers Thursday at a subway depot,
but released most today.
   Prosecutors said they would charge 15 union leaders for
organizing the strike, which was spurred by demands that the head of
the subway corporation be fired for purportedly bargaining in bad
faith during recent labor talks.

<TEXT>
   A Moslem conference has rejected
Iran's call for the execution of novelist Salman Rushdie and
embraced a provisional Afghan government that Tehran opposed.
   Foreign ministers of the 46-member Organization of Islamic
Conference on Thursday condemned Rushdie's book ``The Satanic
Verses,'' which many Moslems have protested as blasphemous. They
also issued a separate declaration condemning the author as an
apostate.
   However, they did not approve Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
fatwa, or religious decree, of Feb. 14 ordering Moslems to kill him.
   In addition, no mention was made in the declaration of Iran's
demand that Islamic Conference members break relations with Britain
and other Western powers on the ground they incited and protected
Rushdie. Iran severed relations with Britain earlier this month over
the dispute.
   Rushdie, 41, was born in Bombay, India, to Moslem parents but now
is a British citizen. He went into hiding after Khomeini pronounced
the death sentence and Iranian clerics added a reward of $5.2
million.
   The conference also gave the organization's vacant 46th seat to a
provisional government formed by the Moslem guerrillas trying to
overthrow the Soviet-backed Afghan government. The Afghan seat was
declared vacant after a communist coup in April 1978 began the civil
war in that nation.
   The government-in-exile, now based in Pakistan, is dominated by
Sunni Moslems. Shiite insurgents based in Iran oppose the
government, claiming it does not give them enough representation.
Iran backs their stand.
   Delegates adopted 50 resolutions at the final session of the
four-day conference on Thursday. They expressed support for the
Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupied territories, now more than
15 months old, and regaining the Arab sector of Jerusalem now
controlled by Israel.

   Discovery's astronauts packed today
for the end of their 1.9 million-mile voyage and prepared the
shuttle for a fiery plunge toward a dawn landing Saturday on a
California desert.
   Discovery commander Michael L. Coats and pilot John E. Blaha
planned to run through a series of tests today to make sure the
shuttle's computers and control jets were ready for the return to
Earth.
   The other astronauts made final runs on a group of experiments
and followed a script to shoot the last 4,000 feet of film in a
powerful 70mm IMAX camera used principally to study the Earth's
environmental trouble spots. Then they were to stow their equipment
for the trip home.
   All of the crewmen stopped their work for an interview arranged
with the ``Today'' show on NBC, but then found they had to wait more
than three minutes while the network completed a feature on Texas
dove hunting and ran four commercials.
   Asked about environmental damage viewed from space, James F.
Buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution ``is much more
dramatic'' as seen from orbit.
   ``What we're trying to do is get some evidence and documentation
to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into the
atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future
generations,'' the astronaut said. ``You can see (it) very, very
well from here.''
   Coats said that early in the mission, when an electrical problem
forced the astronauts to reduce power usage, ``it wasn't really a
great deal to us.''
   ``We powered down a lot of our computer displays. We powered down
our lighting as much as possible,'' he said. ``It was a little bit
of an inconvenience, but not a real impact on our work.''
   Discovery's early bird crew pre-empted the traditional morning
music from Mission Control in Houston for a third day in a row.
   A few minutes before they were to be awakened, the astronauts
beamed to Earth a tape of ``Hi Ho, Hi Ho, It's Off To Work We Go,''
the work song of the seven dwarfs in the animated movie classic
``Snow White.''
   Mission Control capsule communicator David Low, referring to the
seven dwarfs, responded, ``We can account for Grumpy, Sleepy, Happy,
Sneezy and Doc up there. Who wants to sign up to be Bashful and
Dopey.''
   ``I'm not gonna touch that,'' said Coats with a laugh.
   The other Discovery astronauts are James F. Buchli, Robert C.
Springer, and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.
   Early on Saturday, Coats and Blaha will fire two powerful rockets
on the back of Discovery to slow the craft and allow it to drop into
the Earth's atmosphere. The shuttle will then make a powerless glide
halfway around the world and land at 6:36 a.m. PST at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif., in the Mojave Desert.
   The landing will complete a flight of four days, 23 hours and 38
minutes that circled the Earth 79{ times.
   If the shuttle lands at the time now scheduled, the mission will
have been about 1{ hours shorter than planned. Discovery was
launched almost two hours late on Monday, because of weather
considerations, and this put the craft in position to land in
California one orbit early.
   NASA officials said the forecasts call for good weather at
Edwards for the shuttle landing.
   Discovery will return to Earth with almost three miles of film
shot with the IMAX camera. The crew captured views of urban sprawl,
of pollution patterns in the oceans, and of vast areas in South
America where the tropical rain forest is being cleared and burned.
   The camera also photographed floods in Africa, burned areas of
the Florida Everglades and western United States, and erupting
volcanoes in South America and Southeast Asia.
   Film from the IMAX will be edited to create a study of the
environmental wounds inflicted on the Earth by industrial man. It is
a joint probject of NASA and the Smithsonian Institution.
   The end of Discovery's mission also will be the end for four rats
carried in cages aboard the shuttle. The rats will be killed so
their skeletons can be studied in an experiment on how
weightlessness affects the healing of injured bones. Before launch,
small chips were cut from one bone on each rat.
   Other experiments on Discovery include comparing the development
of chicken embryos in space vs. those on Earth; a group of plants
grown in space to test the effects of weightlessness on root growth;
a protein crystal growth study using 19 different proteins; and a
device called the heat pipe, which is a type of cooling system being
tested for use on the space station.
   Discovery's primary mission goal was to release the $100 million
Tracking and Data Relay Satellite. This was accomplished smoothly on
Monday and the satellite later rocketed itself to a stationary orbit
22,300 miles over the Atlantic. The satellite completes an orbiting
communications network for NASA that includes two working TDRS and a
spare.
   The mission is 28th in the space shuttle and the first of seven
missions planned this year by NASA. It is also the third shuttle
mission since flights resumed following the 1986 Challenger disaster
that killed seven astronauts.

   Mississippi State University students
have elected the first black student body president and vice
president in the predominantly white school's history.
   Steven Cooper, a senior industrial engineering-management major
from Jackson, received 1,267 votes in a runoff election Thursday to
become president of the Mississippi State University Student
Association. He beat John Arledge, a junior communications major
from Gautier, who received 924 votes.
   Cooper ran unsuccessfully in 1985 and said Thursday's victory was
a surprise. But he added that that he didn't feel race was an issue
in the election.
   ``My friends are all different colors,'' he said. ``People saw
beneath the skin.''
   In the runoff, students also elected the first black student body
vice president _ Kelvin Covington, a senior marketing major from
Charleston.
   A total of 1,729 students participated in the run-off election.
There are about 12,000 students at Mississippi State, which has a 12
percent black enrollment.

   The departure of six senior political
appointees at the Education Department paves the way for more
cooperation and less ideology at the agency, members of the
education community said.
   The department said Thursday that President Bush had accepted the
resignations this week of five assistant secretaries and a deputy
undersecretary. They will leave by next Thursday.
   ``There really is a new breeze,'' said education analyst Emily
Feistritzer, director of the National Center for Education
Information, an independent, nonpartisan research group.
   She predicted a return to ``collaborative efforts between the
special interest groups and the Department of Education'' that were
the norm before former secretary William Bennett brought his
confrontational style to bear.
   ``Bennett was very ideological and defined the Education
Department as a bully pulpit,'' she said. ``All the people (he
brought in) that didn't leave earlier of their own accord pretty
much are being moved on out.''
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, a conciliator who has reached
out to all segments of the education community, is a holdover from
late in the Reagan administration. Bush recently nominated Illinois
school superintendent Ted Sanders to be undersecretary, the No. 2
slot, and former White House aide Nancy Moore Kennedy to be
assistant secretary for legislation, a slot now vacant.
   There are seven assistant secretary and three deputy
undersecretary slots at the department. The six appointees whose
resignations were accepted are:
   _Patrick Pizzella, deputy undersecretary for management.
   _Legree Daniels, assistant secretary for civil rights.
   _Kenneth Whitehead, assistant secretary for postsecondary
education.
   _Beryl Dorsett, assistant secretary for elementary and secondary
education.
   _Madeleine Will, assistant secretary for special education and
rehabilitative services.
   _Patricia Hines, assistant secretary for educational research and
improvement.
   ``Just after the president was elected, he said he thought it
would be a good idea to bring a lot of fresh faces into
government,'' said department spokeswoman Mary Crawford. ``This is
consistent with his thinking. We don't have successors named for
those posts yet. What we'll do here is appoint acting office heads.''
   Lamar Haynes, manager for intergovernmental relations at the
National Education Association, said the teachers union has had
problems with some department offices, including lack of what the
union considered proper enforcement of education civil rights laws.
   ``When we began working with Secretary Cavazos, we immediately
saw some very hopeful signs of being able to collaborate on a lot of
issues and being able to have a voice at the department level,''
Haynes said. ``We are hopeful that the replacements will have
similar philosophies as the current secretary in terms of his
interests and priorities.''
   David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on
Education, an umbrella group for higher education organizations,
called the departures ``a continuation of the direction in which the
department's been moving'' since Bennett left.
   ``It's clear that Secretary Cavazos has been working to
re-establish a good relationship with higher education,'' Merkowitz
said. He said the newly constituted department will be less
ideological than the Bennett regime because ``that is the tone the
secretary has set.''
   Cavazos has said he is interested in helping disadvantaged
students, preventing dropouts, and making sure minorities have
access to higher education.

<HEAD>What Is The Frequency That Jammed Garage Doors? The Navy Knows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy has lifted the veil of secrecy
surrounding mysterious radio signals _ and allowed hundreds of
jammed garage doors to lift as well.
   When the Navy flicked a switch Thursday, life returned to normal
for suburbanites whose electronic garage doors had mysteriously
failed to operate for days.
   ``I was testing the (opener) every day, and then all of a sudden,
bingo, it started working,'' said Stan Stuttaford of Alamo.
   The culprit, the Navy disclosed, was a powerful radio wave it had
beamed off a satellite dish on Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County.
The signals provided communications to a ship at Alameda whose
regular communications devices had broken.
   ``Maybe it didn't dawn on people (in the Navy) how widespread the
effect would be,'' said Lt. Joe Murphy at the Navy's San Francisco
base. Murphy, who opens his own garage door by hand, said the Navy
will look into ways to prevent such disruptions in the future.
   Tom Hora, a spokesman with the Federal Communications Commission
in Livermore, on Tuesday said a government agency had been
transmitting the signals, but he declined to name it.
   Garage door openers operate on radio frequencies used by the
government and others with authorization. Hora said the public
wasn't told about the problem because the remote control openers are
considered ``unprotected devices.''
   Jammed garage doors were reported in Concord, Orinda, Walnut
Creek, Alamo, Lafayette, Moraga, Danville, San Ramon and Livermore.

   The city's school board has upheld a
five-day suspension of Principal Joe Clark by a 7-1 vote, with the
dissenting vote from a commissioner who wanted the flamboyant
principal dismissed.
   The board's vote Thursday came two days after the City Council
passed a resolution suggesting that Clark should be fired for
allowing scantily clad dancers to perform at a school assembly last
month.
   School Superintendent Frank Napier ordered the suspension with
pay; the school board ratified his decision. Clark began the
suspension Monday and will return to school next week.
   On the day of the assembly, Clark has said he was out of town
promoting ``Lean On Me,'' a movie about his tenure at Eastside,
where he's known for roaming the halls with a baseball bat and
bullhorn. He has said he did not expect the dancers to perform as
they did.

   A landlord discriminated against an
unmarried couple by refusing to rent a house to them, a judge has
ruled.
   Minnesota Human Rights Commissioner Stephen Cooper, whose lawsuit
against Layle French alleged violations of the state's Human Rights
Act, said the decision was filed Wednesday by Judge Peter Erickson.
He said Thursday that Erickson still must decide damages in the case.
   The state's lawsuit sought damages from French for refusing to
rent a house to Susan Parsons because she planned to live there with
her fiance. The lawsuit was based on a section of the state's law
that says refusal to rent on the basis of marital status is
discriminatory.
   French argued that the Human Rights Act violated his religious
beliefs forbidding sex before marriage.
   ``The Bible clearly states this is wrong,'' French had said. ``I
live with the Bible as my guide.''
   French claimed the law violated his First Amendment right to
freedom of religion and said he believed that by living together the
couple would violate a little-known state statute that prohibits
sexual intercourse between unmarried adults.
   But the judge said that, when a person engages in for-profit
undertakings, his religious beliefs are not totally protected by the
Constitution.
   French's attorney, James Anderson, said he would appeal after the
damages are assessed.
   ``I don't understand the logic behind the law,'' French said
Thursday, adding that it's ``frustrating to see these kinds of
things go on'' and not be able to do anything about it.

<HEAD>Talk Show Host Sued, Accused of Bilking Investors In 1982 Real Estate
Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some real estate investors are suing talk
show host Morton Downey Jr., accusing him of selling them worthless
plots of land in the California desert advertised as containing
gold, a newspaper reported today.
   A federal judge in California has set a May 24 hearing on the
lawsuit, The Record reported.
   The class action lawsuit, filed in December in U.S. District
Court in San Francisco, charges that from 1982 to 1983, the
then-unknown Downey bilked investors out of $10 million to $20
million.
   Downey, 56, whose ``Morton Downey Jr.'' television show is taped
at WWOR-TV in Secaucus, told the paper he was only a consultant for
the enterprise, and his only payment was $6,500 for giving
motivational speeches to company salespersons.
   Downey maintained that another partner in the venture, John W.
Mangham, added his name to a list of company officers without his
knowledge.
   However, the newspaper reported that documents in the Nevada
Secretary of State's Office list Downey as the sole officer of
Magdalena Mining Corp., one of three companies involved in the
lawsuit. Magdalena Mining's charter was revoked in 1987 after Downey
failed to make annual financial filings, the office said.
   Mangham, now a business consultant in San Diego, declined to
comment on Downey's charges. But, he said, ``There was no fraud
involved as far as Downey and I were concerned.''
   He said the $10 million to $20 million figure that the lawsuit
claims the companies earned is ``woefully inaccurate on the high
side.'' He declined to say how much the enterprise did collect.
   ``You have a couple of investors looking for money because the
deal was not successful,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An estimated 250,000 people watched the
St. Patrick's Day parade in Dublin today, wearing shamrocks and
waving Irish tricolor flags to honor Ireland's patron saint.
   Under sunny skies, two bands, a drill team and 120 floats,
sponsored by businesses and companies, paraded along the 1{-mile
route from St. Stephen's Green to the main reviewing stand in
O'Connell Street.
   Dubliners gave a warm welcome to the estimated 1,700 foreigners,
many from the United States, who took part in the parade. Another
2,000 foreign tourists lined the route to watch the festivities.
   The day's celebrations kicked off with a ceremonial blessing of
the shamrock in front of the reviewing stand by clergymen
representing the Roman Catholic, Church of Ireland, Presbyterian and
Methodist churches, and the chief rabbi of Ireland, Dr. Ephraim
Mirvis.
   Then, the Deputy Lord Mayor of Dublin, Alice Glenn, arrived at
the stand in the lord mayor's coach. Lord Mayor Ben Briscoe is in
New York for the St. Patrick's Day parade there.
   Mrs. Glenn joined the minister for labor, Bertie Ahern, in
reviewing the parade. He is one of the few government ministers left
in Ireland.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey is in Washington, Foreign Minister
Brian Lenihan is in Canada, and other ministers are in the United
States and France representing Ireland at various official functions.
   Mrs. Glenn said at the parade:
   ``We especially remember today our young emigrants who have left
the country. We wish them well and hope they have a lovely day.''
   The parade's grand marshal was Mike Miller from Texas, who is the
executive director of the NCA Superstars drill team. The team
itself, comprising 112 cheerleaders, pom pom girls and dancers,
performed for the the spectators.
   Eight other groups from the United States also took part in the
parade. They included two bands from Illinois, the Riverview High
School Kiltie band and the St. Laurence High School band.
   Marching groups came from New York, Washington D.C., Michigan,
Chicago, Florida and Pennsylvania.
   The parade was the focus of strong media attention from abroad,
with 11 television and radio crews broadcasting 30 hours of coverage
to the United States and Canada.
   St. Patrick's Day parades were also held in Cork, Limerick and
Galway and in many other smaller towns throughout the country.
   Other festivities include a traditional Irish music festival at
venues around Dublin, and the Lord Mayor's St. Patrick's Day ball at
the Burlington Hotel Friday night which 1,000 guests are expected to
attend.

   JAL EL-DEEB, Lebanon (AP) _ A car bomb exploded during the
morning rush hour today about 50 yards from the British Embassy in
Christian east Beirut, and police reported that 12 people were
killed and 75 wounded.
   A radio station said the embassy may have been the intended
target of the attack and that officials there had received threats
from people offended by Salman Rushdie's book, ``The Satanic
Verses.''
   The blast came during a lull in several days of fierce fighting
between Christian and Moslem forces. No group claimed responsibility
for the bomb.
   The car, packed with an estimated 110 pounds of TNT, blew up
outside the Abu Habib bakery on the coastal highway in suburban Jal
el-Deeb at 10:45 a.m., a police spokesman said.
   The blast wrecked the one-story bakery. The blood-stained
wreckage was strewn with pieces of human flesh, said the spokesman,
who cannot be named under standing regulations.
   He said a travel agency on the ground floor of the six-story
building that houses the British Embassy was completely wrecked. But
the only damage to the third-floor embassy was broken windows. The
spokesman said 12 people were killed and 75 wounded in the attack.
   Gunmen of the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia,
fired automatic weapons in the air to clear a path for ambulances
and fire engines through the devastated street.
   Nervous Lebanese guards of the embassy crouched at corners around
the building, fired machine gun volleys into the air, and prevented
reporters from entering the building.
   The explosion set several shops and cars ablaze. Fire crews
doused the fire with water, and ambulance teams picked up bodies
from the dripping wreckage.
   The army command of Gen. Michel Aoun, whose mainly Christian
troops have been battling Moslem Druse militiamen for nine days of
fighting, accused the Syrian army in Moslem west Beirut of planting
the bomb.
   Aoun's headquarters charged in a communique that the Syrians, who
support Lebanon's Moslems and control security in west Beirut,
engineered the bombing to provoke new fighting between the rival
forces in the divided capital.
   But Aoun's communique stressed: ``Our army units will not be be
dragged into bombarding our people in west Beirut.''
   The Voice of Lebanon radio station run by the rightist Christian
Phalange Party said the proximity of the blast to the British
Embassy suggested that the mission might have been the intended
target.
   ``The British Embassy has received threats of attacks over Salman
Rushdie's controversial novel, `The Satanic Verses','' the broadcast
said.
   ``But it could not be immediately ascertained whether today's
blast was an implementation of these threats.''
   Many Moslems claim that Rushdie's novel blasphemes Islam. Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has ordered Rushdie killed.
   Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems groups in Lebanon have vowed to carry
out Khomeini's death sentence and attack British targets because
London has refused to condemn the book or put Rushdie on trial.
   Rushdie, who was born into a Moslem family in India, has since
become a British citizen and has been in hiding in England.
   Today's explosion was the fifth car bombing in Lebanon this year.
At least 13 people were killed and 68 wounded in the previous
bombings.
   Police said a cease-fire went into effect at midnight Thursday
Aoun's forces and Syrian-backed militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt.
   Forty-nine people were killed and 161 wounded in nine days of
fighting.

<TEXT>
   Marine biologists have reluctantly
halted a rescue effort for a 35-foot California gray whale after the
giant mammal, ensnared in fishing nets, disappeared into the fog.
   When the fog lifted Thursday night the whale was gone, and
scientists who had lost track of the animal earlier in the day
called off their intensive search.
   The bologists said they hoped boaters who spot the 25-ton animal
would alert them.
   The northbound whale was first spotted Tuesday off Dana Point.
   A team of biologists from the Long Beach-based Whale Rescue Unit
tried to get close enough to cut away the nets, but lost the whale
in fog near Newport Beach, 45 miles southeast of Los Angeles.
   The netting wrapped around the whale's flukes eventually could
cause it to drown, said Joe Cordero, a spokesman for the National
Marine Fisheries Service.
   Debris picked up in the net could drag the mammal under water,
and the nets probably will wrap tighter around the whale as it
struggles to free itself, said Tom Lewis, co-director of the Whale
Rescue Unit.
   From 10 to 15 whales become trapped in giant nets and slowly die
each year during the migratory journey between California and
Mexico's Baja California, Lewis said.
   There are an estimated 21,000 California whales.
   Whales began migrating from the warmer waters in Mexico earlier
this month and will continue their northward treks through May.

<TEXT>
   Severe winter weather has
taken a heavy toll on elk in Yellowstone National Park, and nearly
one-third of the park's 19,000-head northern herd may have died,
park biologists say.
   Mortality rates were highest following the arctic cold in early
February and a second severe storm at the end of the month,
biologists said.
   The elk death rate generally peaks during the last two weeks of
March, said park biologist Frank Singer. ``This year, we hit the
peak after the arctic front,'' he said.
   Singer said the mortality rate was estimated by tracking elk
equipped with radio collars. Nearly one-third of those animals have
died, he said.
   In addition to stress from severe cold and snow, summer forest
fires swept some grazing areas already affected by drought, forcing
the animals outside the protection of the park in search of food.
   About one-third of the elk deaths were attributed to hunters
outside the park near Gardiner, Mont.
   More than half of the Yellowsone elk herd remains outside the
park. Bison that also migrated outside Yellowstone in search of food
have begun moving back into the park's interior, but biologists say
it probably will be several weeks before the elk return.
   The elk probably will benefit from the growth of new vegetation
spurred by the fires, Singer said.
   ``I can't think of a species that will benefit more,'' he said.

   A mail order preacher known for his work
with the homeless is charged with raping a 10-year-old girl, who
suffered through three years of molestation because she was afraid
of losing her home, police said.
   The child remained silent because William J. Keichline, 52,
threatened to evict her and her family if she said anything,
according to affidavits filed Thursday. Keichline, who owns several
rental properties, was the family's landlord.
   New Castle County police arrested Keichline on Thursday at his
home in Wilton and charged him with multiple counts of unlawful
sexual intercourse, unlawful sexual contact and sexually exploiting
a child, according to affidavits filed in Magistrate Court.
   Keichline is founder and pastor of Mission of Care Inc., which
helps the needy and homeless. The organization fired Keichline
within hours of his arrest and was not implicated in the
investigation, police said. Keichline's rental properties are
independent of the organization.
   Keichline, who was held in Gander Hill Prison for lack of
$330,000 bail, denied the charges through an attorney.
   In 1983, the Delaware General Assembly passed a resolution
honoring Mission of Care for opening a shelter for 17 homeless
people during record cold.
   According to the affidavits, Keichline showed the youngster child
pornography and sometimes forced her to pose for videotapes and
photos, which were found in a search of his home. The child spoke to
police after her mother became suspicious of Keichline, court
records indicated.
   Keichline paid $25 in 1984 to gain ordination in the National
Chaplains Association of the Christian Church in Pigeon Forge, Tenn.

<DATELINE>STARKE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Town officials have agreed to change to
district elections and to pay $195,000 to the NAACP after losing a
lawsuit charging the town's voting practices disenfranchised black
residents.
   The Bradford County chapter of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People filed the lawsuit in 1986 to challenge
the city's at-large election system.
   The Starke City Commission Wednesday approved the settlement and
a plan to establish a black majority voting district on the
northeast side of town.
   No black official has ever been elected in Starke. The northern
Florida town of 5,300 is 31 percent black.
   U.S. District Judge W. Terrell Hodges ruled Feb. 27 that
political opportunity had been denied Starke's black residents
because of at-large elections and gave attorneys 30 days to propose
remedies.
   The NAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups
have been challenging the at-large voting system in Southern
communities for many years.
   Among the discriminatory practices cited by the NAACP was a
clause in the 1927 city charter, never amended, that requires blacks
to live in the northeast.
   ``I'm sorry we lost the case and we lost $195,000. On the other
hand, I fought for what I thought was right,'' City Commissioner
Charles Schaefer said Thursday.
   He said he would not seek re-election to the post he has held for

   A bomb warning dated two days before Pan Am Flight
103 was destroyed over Scotland was an unimportant document and was
mailed after the disaster, the transport secretary said in an
interview published today.
   ``It went out after Christmas. I cannot tell you the exact date
but some days after Christmas,'' the secretary, Paul Channon, was
quoted by The Times of London as saying. ``It was not a great new
warning which we had to send out by telex. It was a bit of
supplementary information containing some color photographs,'' the
newspaper quoted him as saying.
   Disclosure of the Dec. 19 letter, warning of a radio-cassette
bomb such as the one which has been identified as killing 270 people
in the Pan Am disaster, brought new demands from opposition
lawmakers for a full public inquiry.
   Published reports that investigators have identified and even
arrested a suspect in the bombing were denied by authorities in
Britain and West Germany.
   As criticism mounted of the government's handling of bomb
warnings, a spokesman for the governing Conservative Party pointed a
finger at Pan Am.
   ``The truth of the matter is that the West German authorities
told Pan Am about a bomb in early November. The American government
told Pan Am about it on Nov. 18,'' Conservative lawmaker David
Wilshire said today. ``So what has it got to do with the British
government? Are Pan Am deaf or not?''
   Pamela Hanlon, a Pan Am spokeswoman in New York, confirmed today
that the airline received a warning from the West German government
on Nov. 10 and another warning from the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration on Nov. 18.
   Wilshire charged that Pan Am had covered up the earlier warnings,
but Ms. Hanlon said: ``Frankly, I don't think it's for the company
to disclose that.
   ``The Nov. 18 advisory that went out from the FAA was not openly
disclosed by the company per the FAA's directive,'' she said.
   The Times of London, quoting unidentified government sources,
reported today that authorities know who bombed Flight 103. But the
report was denied by British officials and an official in West
Germany, where the flight originated.
   ``I can confirm to you that there is insufficient evidence to
establish the identity of the person or group responsible for
this,'' said Inspector Tom McCulloch, a spokesman for the crash
investigation in Lockerbie, Scotland. He said there were no plans
for an announcement as reported by the newspaper.
   ``I haven't given any insructions for the arrest of anyone,''
Scotland's chief legal officer, Lord Fraser, told ``CBS This
Morning,'' but added, ``Of course, there are suspicions.''
   ``I certainly do not have an identification which I could
consider putting before a court in Scotland, in England, or indeed
in any civilized jurisdiction,'' said Fraser, who is lord advocate
of Scotland.
   ``It would be useful if all these sources would share this
information with us,'' Alexander Prechtel, spokesman for chief West
German federal prosecutor Kurt Rebmann, said today of the reports
the identity of the bomber is known.
   Prechtel dismissed the story as ``absolute nonsense.''
   British and West German authorities also dismissed another report
in a British tabloid today that said a suspect belonging to a
radical Palestinian group had been taken into custody in Europe.
   All 259 people on the New York-bound flight and 11 people on the
ground in Lockerbie were killed in the disaster. The flight
originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and passengers changed to a
Boeing 747 at London's Heathrow airport.
   The Times said police and security services know who made and
placed the bomb aboard the craft, as well as the whereabouts of the
bomber.
   ``The results of what Whitehall (British government) sources term
`one of the most remarkable feats of criminal detection ever known'
are expected to be disclosed next week,'' The Times said without
elaborating.
   The London tabloid Today reported this morning that a terrorist
who planted the bomb had been arrested. ``The prime suspect, a
member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General
Command, is believed to be under heavy guard somewhere in Europe,''
it said.

<HEAD>Teen-agers Convicted In Ax Murders Of Four Family Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW WESTMINSTER, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two teen-agers have been
convicted in the ax murders of four members of one family, including
the father of one of the youths.
   Eric Peever, 18, and Tyrone Borglund, 17, appeared impassive
after their conviction Thursday when they were sentenced to life in
prison with no chance of parole for at least 25 years.
   ``Words cannot possibly describe the ghastly and violent nature
of your acts,'' said British Columbia Supreme Court Justice Wallace
Oppal. ``The premeditated violence that took place in this case is
immeasurable.''
   Karsten Madsen, 38; his second wife, Leny, 30; and their
children, Jason, 11, and Michelle, 9, were killed in their sleep
Jan. 17, 1988, in Mission, about 30 miles east of Vancouver.
   Peever was Madsen's son from his first marriage and Borglund
lived with the family as a foster child.
   ``You have wiped out a whole family,'' Oppal said. ``In all my
years I have never seen such havoc and violence as in this case.''
   Michael Peever, 16, testified that his older brother and Borglund
decided to kill and rob the family because they were angry over
Madsen's discipline.
   According to testimony, Borglund was intoxicated when he attacked
Madsen and his wife, and then the children.
   Peever admitted hitting Mrs. Madsen once with a hatchet before
fleeing.
   Mrs. Madsen's sister, Beppie Henry, said Borglund was ``a problem
child.'' She and her husband, Pidge, said Mrs. Madsen was terrified
of Borglund and several times insisted that provincial Human
Resources Ministry officials place him in another foster home.
   He was moved a few times during the year he spent with the
Madsens, but each time asked to be sent back, the Henrys said.
   Ministry officials refused to comment on the case.

<TEXT>
   A woman will be allowed to pursue a lawsuit
seeking joint custody of her former female lover's daughter, who was
born during their lesbian relationship, a court official has ruled.
   ``It's exciting that a person who is not a natural biological
parent can proceed in a same-sex relationship case,'' said attorney
Gloria Allred, who is representing the mother's former lover, Terri
Sabol.
   Superior Court Commissioner James Endman allowed the custody case
to proceed Thursday after a closed session with attorneys for Ms.
Sabol and the mother, who has not been identified.
   Ms. Sabol claims she is entitled to parental rights because she
intended to have the child, planned for it, arranged for sperm to be
donated by one of her relatives, assisted with the artificial
insemination, paid child and spousal support after the baby was born
on Dec. 16, 1986, and parented the child until she and the mother
broke up.
   Ms. Sabol, 32, has a court hearing March 30 to seek temporary
visitation rights of the 2-year-old girl known as Baby B until the
matter is resolved at trial.
   Mitchell Jacobs, the mother's attorney, said his client will seek
dismissal of the case at that hearing.
   Ms. Sabol filed a lawsuit seeking joint custody after the
29-year-old mother began to restrict her time with the child after
their break-up.

<TEXT>
   The FBI is investigating a pro-Iranian student
group to determine if the bombing of a van driven by the USS
Vincennes skipper's wife was a terrorist act, a newspaper reported
today.
   An Iranian man who attended San Diego State University and now
works near the campus said that FBI agents investigating last
Friday's bombing questioned him twice this week about any militant
Iranians who may be enrolled at the school.
   ``I didn't have any names, and if I had any names I'm afraid I'd
get (those people) in trouble by giving them out,'' the source who
requested anonymity told the Los Angeles Times.
   The investigators wanted information about members of The
International Muslim Students Association, one of four Iranian
student groups on the San Diego State campus, the source said. He
described the group as consisting of five or six avowed supporters
of Iran's ruler, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   A spokesman for that group told the Times that it was not
involved in the bomb attack.
   ``My wish is that they catch the person who did this, because my
opinion is that it was not done by somebody practicing Islam,'' said
the spokesman, who was not identified. ``It was done by somebody who
wants to inflame hatred against Muslims.''
   An FBI spokesman in San Diego, Ronald Orrantia, refused to
confirm that the man had been interviewed or to name anyone the
agency has questioned about the attack.
   The FBI is investigating the bombing as a possible terrorist act
in retaliation for the mistaken downing of an Iranian airliner by
the Vincennes last July in the Persian Gulf.
   Capt. Will C. Rogers III, the ship's commander, had driven the
van from home to a nearby store and back shortly before his wife,
Sharon, left for work in it.
   Mrs. Rogers, who was driving alone, got out at a San Diego
intersection just before the van burst into flames because she heard
a popping noise, city fire officials have said.
   Meanwhile, trustees at La Jolla Country Day School announced
Thursday that Mrs. Rogers will quit her fourth-grade teaching job
there because of fears that her presence could expose students to
terrorist attacks.
   The school received a telephoned bomb threat Tuesday, but
authorities found no explosives.
   The FBI also is investigating Wednesday's call to a Los Angeles
radio station from a man who said that he was a member of Guardians
of the Islamic Revolution, which he said was responsible for the
bomb attack.
   Rogers continues as skipper of the Vincennes, which returned from
its Persian Gulf deployment last October.
   The couple's son, Will Rogers IV, a sophomore at Colgate
University in Hamilton, N.Y., has been moved off campus from his
dormitory so that Navy bodyguards can protect him from possible
terrorist attacks, officials said.

   The nation's oldest and largest St. Patrick's Day
parade headed up Fifth Avenue today, with its first woman grand
marshal saying she felt she was ``walking on air.''
   Green, white and gold Irish flags fluttered above the avenue on a
warm, sunny morning as the first of 150,000 marchers, including 186
marching bands, stepped off. Spectators massed behind police
barricades to cheer or jeer politicians and to hear bagpipes, fifes
and drums.
   Sponsors predicted 1.25 million spectators along the avenue for
the parade, which was preceded by a Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral
celebrated by Cardinal John O'Connor.
   O'Connor used the occasion to deliver a politically charged
sermon in which he said the fallacy that the Irish are a violent
people needs to be corrected.
   ``How little we concern ourselves with the problems of Northern
Ireland because we believe the Irish love to fight, that they're a
violent people,'' he said.
   In Savannah, Ga., organizers of the nation's second-largest
celebration of Ireland's patron saint, said they expected a turnout
of 500,000.
   At Cape Canaveral, Fla., engineers monitoring the flight of the
space shuttle Discovery changed the shading on a world map from its
normal blue to a vivid green. The map is used to track the orbital
progress of the shuttle.
   At a breakfast before the New York parade, Mayor Edward I. Koch
compared the struggle of Dorothy Hayden Cudahy to become grand
marshal to that of women in the suffragette movement.
   Wearing green leather boots and a white dress of Donegal wool
``handmade just for the occasion,'' she said before the march:
``They're honoring St. Patrick. ... I'm the grand marshal and I'm
walking on air.''
   Mrs. Cudahy is known as the First Lady of Irish Radio because of
a local radio program she has been host of for more than 40 years.
   As part of the city's celebration, the top 30 floors of the
Empire State Building are being illuminated with green lights.
   In Savannah, workers added green dye to the city's downtown
fountains.
   The grand marshal for today's parade was Charles Ray, 65, the
grandson of Irish immigrants.
   According to Irish folklore, Ray said, ``The grand marshal is
supposed to die the day after the parade so (he) can't do anything
bigger than that. But that probably won't happen. I'll be too
happy.''

   Leftist guerrillas forced two
city mayors to resign today and disrupted public transportation and
electrical power nationwide in a bid to disrupt Sunday's
presidential election.
   The mayors of the northern provincial capital of Chalatenango and
the northwest city of Metapan resigned after the rebels renewed
threats against the country's mayors over clandestine radio.
   The armed forces said guerrilla threats to shoot people driving
on the nation's highways reduced traffic by 90 percent. Officials
said the rebels had knocked out about 60 percent of the electrical
power nationwide. Rebel sabotage also halted water and telephone
service in some areas, the officials said.
   Leftist rebels, who boycotted the last five elections, renewed
calls on Salvadorans to boycott Sunday's voting, broadcasting death
threats against poll workers. Three-pronged metal tacks were
scattered on streets to puncture tires.
   The three main presidential contenders in the election are
Alfredo Cristiani, 41, of the rightist Repubican Nationalist
Alliance, or Arena; Fidel Chavez Mena of the incumbent Christian
Democrats; and Guillermo Ungo of the leftist Democratic Convergence
alliance. The Arena candidate is favored to win.
   The incumbent, President Napoleon Duarte, is barred by law from
seeking a second five-year term.
   The mayors' resignations brought to 137 the number who have left
their jobs because of rebel threats. Nine Salvadoran mayors have
been assassinated.
   The guerrillas refuse to recognize mayors elected in municipal
voting they consider illegitimate, and more than half the country's
towns and cities are now without chief executives.
   Streets remained vacant in the capital early today.
   Troops stationed at the national university searched vehicles and
everyone who entered and left the campus. A lieutenant who refused
to give his name said the soldiers were looking for bombs and
weapons.
   Reports of guerrilla violence were down today, two days after
campaigning officially ended. But authorities did not expect the
lull to last until Sunday's election.
   ``We are going to hear some bombs, and we are going to see
sabotage and they will make us a bit nervous,'' the defense
minister, Gen. Eugenio Vides Casanova, said Thursday.

<HEAD>Regent Claims Black Skin Pigment Bonds With Drugs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A member of New York state's education
policy-setting board claims a pigment in black skin bonds with
narcotics to help cause drug addiction.
   Adelaide Sanford, in asking the state Board of Regents to devote
more money to drug education and research, suggested the state
should study whether a chemical link is partially responsible for
the disproportionate number of black drug addicts.
   ``The melanin in the skin of children of African descent bonds
with narcotics and causes the addiction,'' Sanford, who is black,
said at a Wednesday night meeting of the board.
   Sanford said through a spokesman today that her statement,
reported in today's New York Post, did not mean blacks are more
prone than whites to drug addiction.
   ``She was just making the point that there ought to be more
research and I don't think anyone disagrees with that view,'' said
Chris Carpenter, a spokesman for the state Education Department and
the Regents.
   Sanford, a retired elementary school teacher from Brooklyn, told
the Post she learned of the possible link between melanin and drugs
from K-M WR Science Consortium, a ``new age'' study group.
   A spokesman for the group, Dr. Neserkar Stewart, said some
research indicates there's a link between drugs and melanin, but it
can't be said this makes blacks more prone to drug addiction.
   ``To say that we have a high drug addiction rate (because of
melanin) ... I don't know if such a blanket statement can be made,''
said Stewart, reached by telephone in Oakland, Calif.
   Dr. Ron Simeone, director of research for the state Division of
Substance Abuse, said he had never heard of such research as cited
by Sanford.
   Sanford was not immediately available for additional comment
because she was in a meeting, Carpenter said.
   New York's education officials have drawn criticism for being
slow to react to the explosion of crack addiction in New York City
and elsewhere.
   It's not the first time Sanford has been at the center of
controversy for racially related comments. Last year, some
legislators called for her resignation after she said that lowering
the dropout rates for white students, as opposed to black students,
was not on her agenda.

<TEXT>
   Former U.S. Rep. Bill Chappell,
defeated last year after 20 years in Congress, announced today that
he is being treated for bone cancer.
   ``I want all my friends to know I'm feeling fine and plan to see
them back in the district soon,'' Chappell, 67, said in a news
release issued by the law offices of Coble and Barkin in Daytona
Beach. A woman who answered the phone there refused to give her name
and said she couldn't make any additional comment.
   Chappell was admitted to the Warren Grant Magnuson Clinical
Center in Methesda, Md., on Feb. 23 by the National Cancer Institute
and is in stable condition, said Irene Haske, chief of the
hospital's communications department.
   The Pentagon procurement scandal may have cost Chappell, a
Democrat, his 4th District seat in November's election. The
investigation has spawned reports that Chappell received political
contributions and financial aid from military suppliers, some of
whom are targets of the inquiry.
   He has said he did nothing wrong and fears nothing from the
investigation into bribery and kickbacks among defense consultants,
Pentagon officials and military contractors.
   ``Nobody has ever put a face on any accusation; nobody has come
forth and said I have done anything, only by innuendo and
insinuation,'' Chappell told the Orlando Sentinel.
   In an interview published Sunday, he said he was enjoying his
retirement.
   ``I have been in politics 36 years, and I honest to goodness
didn't realize how much I was hooked up, tied down to things. I
can't believe the pressure is off. There are days when I don't see a
newspaper of even think about a newspaper,'' Chappell said.

   A 21-year-old man who killed his parents
is inheriting their estate worth more than $160,000 after a court
ruled he had been temporarily insane, a court official said Friday.
   The official said the man, who cannot be identified under Swedish

addition to the family home, two cars and corporate investments. The
court official spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The man from Ystad in southern Sweden acknowleged that he beat
his parents to death on Sept. 15. The district court ruled he had
committed the killings but could not be held responsible for his
actions.
   The court said he was entitled to inherit the estate, which was

   Authorities hanged a former associate of
deposed dictator Idi Amin and two other convicted killers in the
African country's first legal executions of civilians in 10 years, a
newspaper reported Friday.
   Kassim Obura, who headed the feared Public Safety Unit during
Amin's 9-year rule, was hanged in Luzira prison near Kampala on
Wednesday, the state-owned New Vision newspaper said.
   Two other men convicted of murder also were hanged, the report
said.
   Obura was arrested after Amin's overthrow in 1979 and convicted
three years later of shooting on the head with a shotgun a Kampala
trader whose business he later seized.
   At the time of his execution, Obura was was among 80 convicts
waiting to be hanged in the country's jails.
   New Vision said various presidents had failed to sanction death
sentences since 1979 because Uganda's gallows ``were out of order.''
   Although the gallows had not been used, thousands of Ugandans
were killed by security forces during Amin's rule and in subsequent
fighting in which two governments were overthrown.
   President Yoweri Museveni's government, formed after his fighters
chased military rulers from office in 1986, has announced several
firing squad executions of soldiers convicted of committing
atrocities against civilians.

   Taiwanese authorities on Friday detained
and deported a Roman Catholic missionary from Northern Ireland,
claiming his participation in labor rallies and protests was not in
line with his religious work.
   A National Police Administration statement called Rev. Neil
Magill's case an ``isolated issue'' and said he had rejected
warnings from authorities.
   Magill was detained Friday when he showed up at a police station
in Taoyuan, 25 miles southwest of Taipei, to apply for a visa
extension as ordered by police, said Liu Su-chi, an assistant to the
priest.
   The priest, who lived in Taiwan since 1979, was taken directly to
the airport and put on a plane to Hong Kong, she said.
   Magill, 40, of Londonderry, Northern Ireland, had founded a
center for workers in Taoyuan. In April, the center organized a
protest in which Magill marched with about 600 factory workers who
were demanding a better working environment.

   The 21-year-old woman was killed immediately after the bus fell
about 50 feet down a cliff on a highway between the cities of

   Xinhua said the accident occurred on Thursday evening about 130
miles north of Chengdu.
   A Japanese Embassy spokesman said the bus was carrying 17

<HEAD>Sales Surge on Semiautomatic Assault Rifles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By POLLY ANDERSON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Gun dealers reported runs on semiautomatic assault rifles as
collectors, shooters and investors reacted to a ban on imports and a
U.S. company's announcement it would stop selling them.
   ``Yeah, there's been a run,'' said Barry Cupp, manager of The
Bulletstop, a gun shop and target range in Marietta, Ga. ``I've sold
every assault rifle and everything that looks like a assault rifle.''
   Dealers said the run on guns has been limited to the rapid-fire
assault weapons, which have been the object of protest since a
gunman killed five schoolchildren in Stockton, Calif., in January.
   The massacre, and publicity about the use of the guns by drug
dealers, have spurred many city and state governments to consider
banning the guns. Several cities, particularly in California, have
approved bans already.
   On Wednesday, Colt Industries of Hartford, Conn., said it was
suspending sales to the public of its AR-15, a civilian version of
the military's standard M-16 with a list price ranging from $739 to
$1,359.
   The company said the suspension was a voluntary reaction to the
Bush administration's temporary import ban on semiautomatics,
announced Tuesday.
   President Bush, who has generally sided with opponents of gun
bans, said Thursday that any longterm restrictions on rapid-fire
assault weapons must protect ``the rights of the legitimate
sportsman'' as well as the lives of the nation's police officers.
   A semiautomatic rifle fires a round each time the trigger is
pressed. The government already bans sale of automatic weapons,
which fire bullets as long as the trigger is pressed, but many
semiautomatic weapons can be readily converted to automatics.
   Buyers of the weapons this week include gun enthusiasts worried
that the stock soon would be depleted, and investors who have noted
the rapid runup in prices and are hoping that they can profit if it
continues.
   ``It's hysteria running wild,'' said Donald G. Davis, owner of
Don's Guns, a chain of three stores in Indianapolis. ``We could
hardly give one away prior to this mass hysteria, and now every
other customer that comes in here wants (one).''
   ``My price has gone up from about $350 to $1,000 today, and when
I sell half of what I have left the price will go to $1,500,'' Davis
said Thursday.
   At The Gun Gallery in Dallas, an AK-47, a type of gun used in the
Stockton shooting, cost $369 on Monday, $599 on Tuesday, and $799 on
Friday. ``They don't care how much it costs,'' said owner Paul
Rosenberg.
   In Georgia, Cubb said his customers included ``the people who
always wanted one. They mortgaged the house again and come out and
get one. Then there's the investor, who thinks, `If I get one today
for $600, it will be worth $1,200 tomorrow.'''
   ``The white-collar workers, the ones that drive the BMW's and the
Mercedes, they think it's an investment, just like the Rolex watch
they wear on their arm,'' Cubb said.
   A man who answered the phone at the Sandy Trading Post in Sandy,
Ore., where Patrick Purdy bought the AK-47 he used in the Stockton
schoolyard shootings, said the store was not experiencing a run on
the rifles. He also said sales of other guns had not increased.
However, when asked for his name, he hung up.
   In California, where a gun-ban bill passed the state Assembly
this week and a similar one passed the Senate last week, unhappy gun
owners announced plans for a petition drive seeking the recall of
the senator and assemblyman who sponsored the bills.
   ``It (the ban) is simply being ramrodded through without
considering their constituents' true feelings,'' said Ray Hickman of
the 500-member Liberty Coalition of the San Fernando Valley.
   ``I will not be intimidated by recall threats from these Rambo
gun groups,'' countered Sen. David Roberti, sponsor of the Senate
bill.
   Interest in the guns has been on the increase since the
California shootings, but dealers said it was Bush's announcement
Tuesday of the temporary import ban, coupled with Colt's halt in
AR-15 sales, that really spurred sales.
   In Indianapolis, Davis estimated Thursday that has about 30 left
in stock at his three stores. ``If I could find 1,000 today in
America I would buy them all,'' he said. ``We'll be out for sure by
Saturday.''
   He had strong criticism for Colt for halting the AR-15 sales, and
vowed never to sell them again if Colt changes its mind. ``We feel
all they're doing is making love to the American public and lending
themselves to this hysteria,'' Davis said.
   Roy Furbeck, owner of Furbeck's Gun Shop in Chatham, Ill., said
he doesn't sell the assault rifles because ``I don't think there's a
sporting use for them,'' but he's gotten a few calls about them.
   ``People are trying to scalp them,'' he said. ``People have told
me that. They'll get whatever the traffic will bear.''

<HEAD>Car Bomb Kills 12 in Beirut's Christian Sector</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A car bomb exploded 50 yards from the
British Embassy in Christian east Beirut on Friday, demolishing a
crowded bakery and killing 12 people. Police said 75 were wounded.
   No group claimed responsibility. The commander of Christian army
units blamed Syria but a Christian radio station said the target may
have been the embassy because of the controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses'' by Salman Rushdie, a British citizen.
   People were lined up to buy bread at the Habib bakery on a
coastal highway in the Jal el-Deeb district when the car blew up,
hurling bodies into the air, police reported.
   Shattered glass littered the street. Pieces of human flesh could
be seen in the wreckage.
   ``People had taken advantage of the relative calm to buy some
bread and food in fear of another round of shelling,'' a police
spokesman said.
   Beirut residents had taken shelter for more than a week because
of artillery exchanges between Christian soldiers and Moslem
militiamen that rained shells on the city.
   Sporadic shelling continued during the day despite a truce in the
artillery and rocket battle.
   The explosion, which police said equaled 110 pounds of TNT,
wrecked 20 nearby vehicles and devastated shops and restaurants
around the bakery.
   Its force broke the windows of the British Embassy. Edgy Lebanese
guards crouched at corners of the mission, keeping reporters out and
firing volleys into the air from their automatic weapons.
   Hospitals appealed by radio for blood donations. A doctor at the
Abu-Jaoudeh hospital in Jal el-Deeb, his gown stained with blood,
said two bodies were disfigured beyond recognition.
   The emergency ward's waiting area became a makeshift operating
room. Doctors removed glass slivers from the legs and faces of
dozens of victims.
   It was the fifth bombing in Lebanon this year. Police say 13
people were killed and 68 wounded in the four other explosions.
   Voice of Lebanon, the radio station of the Christian Phalange
party, said the nearness to the six-story embassy building suggested
it was the target.
   ``The British Embassy has received threats of attacks over Salman
Rushdie's controversial novel,'' the broadcast said.
   Many Moslems feel ``The Satanic Verses'' blasphemes Islam, and
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran has ordered the author killed.
   Gen. Michel Aoun's Christian army command issued a statement
claiming the Syrian army, which oversees security in Moslem west
Beirut, arranged the bombing to provoke more sectarian artillery
battles.
   ``Our army units will not be be dragged into bombarding our
people in west Beirut,'' it said.
   About three hours after the blast, six shells landed in Christian
east Beirut and four of them hit the government-run port. There were
no reports of casualties or serious damage.
   A cease-fire was proclaimed at midnight Thursday in the
confrontation between Aoun's men and the Syrian-backed Druse militia
led by Walid Jumblatt.
   Fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun impose a blockade on
illegal ports run by Moslem militias.
   It threatened efforts of Arab League mediators to resolve a
political crisis that created Christian and Moslem governments and
has split the army into sectarian commands. Aoun leads the Christian
government in addition to commanding the Christian army.
   Police said 49 people were killed and 161 wounded, nearly all of
them civilians, in the artillery battles. It was the most serious
fighting between Christians and Moslems since 1985 in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Aoun's Christian military cabinet competes with a predominantly
Moslem government led by Premier Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem.
   President Amin Gemayel chose Aoun to lead the government when his
own six-year term expired in September and conservative Christians
would not accept Syria's nominees to succeed him. Moslems then
pledged allegiance to Hoss.
   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the premier Sunni
and the parliament speaker Shiite Moslem.
   Syrian has 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon and has become the nation's
main power broker.

<HEAD>Astronaut's Wife Documents Discovery Flight With Paintings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The wife of one of the astronauts
aboard the space shuttle Discovery is a watercolor artist who plans
to remember the mission with one ``very special'' painting.
   ``I've been following the flight very closely, but the idea of
what I'm going to do hasn't congealed yet,'' Molly Springer said
Friday from her home near the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Her
husband is Bob Springer, who was making his first space flight.
   ``It may be something on the landing,'' she said.
   ``But whatever it is, it definitely will be something very
special,'' she added.
   Discovery's landing was scheduled Saturday morning at Edwards Air
Force Base, Calif.
   Mrs. Springer is a member of the NASA Art Team and one of several
artists commissioned to document the flight of the shuttle Atlantis
with the Magellan Venus probe, scheduled for launch April 28. Her
painting of that flight will become part of the space agency's
official art collection.
   Mrs. Springer's work on her husband's mission was on her own.
   She has been working on a watercolor series which she describes
as an unofficial glimpse of preparations for a space shuttle flight.
   For months, she followed her husband and his crewmates through
their training and she snapped hundreds of photographs, which she
uses as references for her paintings.
   She often points her camera away from the astronauts to focus on
the engineers and technicians ``who never get on camera, never get
in paintings, the people who make it all possible.''
   Space flight is ``a tapestry of people who really care what
happens,'' Mrs. Springer said. ``It just so happens that the
astronaut is the one we see the most.''
   Springer took the camera to places she was not allowed to go.
   ``Where she cannot participate or observe the training, I've been
trying to cover some of that for her,'' Springer said in a
pre-launch interview. He said her paintings lend to the space
program ``a tremendous insight beyond what somebody else from the
outside can see.''

   The Senate gave quick approval today to
Lawrence Eagleburger as deputy secretary of state, the State
Department's No. 2 position.
   The approval was by voice vote.
   Eagleburger's nomination was approved Thursday by the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, but only after sharp questioning from
Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   Helms, who spent two days questioning the nominee's business
relations with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, took part
in the 19-0 vote to approve Eagleburger.
   Senator after senator praised Eagleburger repeatedly during his
two days of testimony for his distinguished 30-year career in
government.
   However, the hearings at times were shadowed by the recent bitter
conflict over former Sen. John Tower's failed nomination to be
Secretary of Defense.
   ``I have the uncomfortable feeling that I'm a test-tube case
here,'' Eagleburger quipped once while under some intense
questioning by Helms.
   Helms asserted that his queries into Eagleburger's dealings with
the consulting firm Kissinger Associates weren't out of line, given
the attention paid to Tower's $1 million in earnings from defense
contractors.
   Tower's nomination was defeated last week. The Senate was
expected to approve the nomination of Rep. Dick Cheney, R-Wyo., as
secretary of Defense today.
   ``I wish he had an opportunity to answer questions in public
about his income,'' Helms said of Tower. ``He wasn't allowed to
defend himself.''
   The senator also jabbed at Eagleburger's $900,000 in earnings
from Kissinger's firm and an affiliate, commenting that the
assessments he gave to multinational corporations on international
affairs ``must be extraordinary advice.''
   The firms Eagleburger dealt with, according to disclosure forms
filed with the Senate, include Anheuser-Busch, the South Korean
conglomerate Daewoo Corp., H.J. Heinz, the Italian car maker Fiat
S.p.a., ITT Corp., A.B. Volvo, Union Carbide, and Coca-Cola.
   Helms also tweaked Kissinger, calling him a ``revolving,
peripatetic entity.''
   ``Henry Kissinger was ... a political entity. He still is. That's
why Larry Eagleburger got well over a million dollars, ... not
because he (Kissinger) was good looking or speaks English
fluently,'' Helms said, a clear dig at Kissinger's looks and thick
accent.
   Helms, a staunch conservative, has been critical for years of
Kissinger's conduct of foreign policy, especially moves toward
closer relations with the Soviet Union, during the Nixon and Ford
administrations.
   Helms questioned whether Eagleburger's work for Kissinger's firm
conflicted with laws that require those who lobby for foreign
governments to register their activities with the U.S. government.
   Eagleburger stressed to the committee that he had never lobbied
the U.S. government on behalf of any of the firm's clients, and had
strictly abided by the law.
   His nomination was approved unanimously after he agreed to
disqualify himself from all matters involving clients who'd had
contact with the firm over the last two years, one of several steps
he agreed to take that went beyond the demands of the Ethics in
Government Act.
   Eagleburger received numerous plaudits for his years at the State
Department, including service as ambassador to Yugoslavia and
undersecretary of state for political affairs, the department's No.
3 post.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was ``not an expert in foreign policy'' and needed
Eagleburger's expertise from 30 years in government.
   ``I want to see the president given this choice,'' Cranston said.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Prague court today gave 10-month
suspended sentences to two young dissidents who have been jailed
since October on charges stemming from anti-government protests.
   Anna Sabatova, a member of the Charter 77 human rights
organization, told reporters that Tomas Dvorak, 23, and Hana
Marvanova, a 26-year-old lawyer, were found guilty on charges of
preparation to incite.
   The judge dropped a more serious charge of incitement that could
have brought the leaders of the Independent Peace Association up to
three years in jail, Ms. Sabatova said.
   But a government prosecutor, Karel Florian, immediately appealed
the sentences, and filed a petition that will keep the two jailed
for at least another 10 days, a source familiar with Czechoslovak
legal procedure said.
   In a related development, the same source, speaking in Vienna on
condition of anonymity, said former Charter 77 spokesman Stanislav
Devaty was arrested in front of the Prague courtroom Thursday and
taken to his hometown of Gottwaldov in Moravia, where he remains in
detention.
   The two-day trial was the latest in a crackdown by the communist
government on dissent following an anti-government demonstrations in
August and January.
   The Aug. 21 protest that drew more than 10,000 marked the 20th
aniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia and was the
most substantial demonstration against the government in 19 years.
   Another Peace Association activist, Jane Petrova, was sentenced
last month to nine months in jail after participating in a peaceful
memorial for Jan Palach, a student who burned himself alive in 1969
to protest the invasion.
   Vaclav Havel, a playwright and prominent human rights activist,
was also sentenced in February to nine months in jail for
involvement in the protest. Seven other activists were jailed, fined
or given suspended sentences.

   A 255-foot medieval tower collapsed in a
downtown square of this northern Italian city today, killing two
people, injuring 25 and burying parked cars and a newspaper stand.
   The casualty figures were provided by a Civil Defense official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said an earlier report by a
fire department spokesman that three people had died was incorrect.
   More than 100 firefighters who dug for hours through the rubble
managed to rescue two men and a woman, the Civil Defense official
told The Associated Press. None of the injured was in serious
condition, doctors at the San Matteo hospital reported. The Civil
Defense said that no one was reported missing but added that rescue
operations were to continue through Saturday.
   The 900-year-old tower collapsed at 9 a.m., scattering its red
bricks throughout the square. The 501-year-old cathedral adjacent to
the collapsed tower suffered substantial damage, and some shops in
the square were struck and damaged, according to the local
archbishop's office.
   ``The baptistery and an arch were cracked following the collapse
of the nearby tower. Experts are checking the extent of the
damage,'' said a local church official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   About 50 people were attending a Mass in the cathedral at the
time of the collapse but none was injured, he said.
   The cathedral was fenced off and nearby streets were closed to
traffic as authorities inspected the cathedral, including the dome
designed by Donato Bramante.
   A spokeswoman for the mayor's office said there had been no signs
indicating the tower was in danger of collapsing. ``It all happened
abruptly and unexpectedly,'' said the spokeswoman who asked not to
be identified.
   Experts had recently checked to determine whether the medieval
tower might need restoration work.
   Maria Antonietta Abrate, who works at the local historical
preservation office, said deterioration of the mortar probably
caused the collapse.
   ``It's something due to age, which cannot be predicted. It's
typical of ancient towers,'' she said.
   Paiva, a former capital of the Longobards _ the German tribe that
founded the city in 568 _ is about 20 miles southwest of Milan.
   Italy's most famous tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, has long
been judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate
future.

   The INF treaty requires the United States and Soviet Union to
cease production, and destroy all existing stocks, of nuclear
missiles with a range of roughly 300 to 3,000 miles.

   Apples expelled from school cafeterias because
of a nationwide cancer scare will return to menus in the nation's
second-largest school district after passing chemical tests.
   Tests for the allegedly cancer-causing chemical Alar, known as
daminozide, proved negative for fresh apples, apple juice,
apple-raisin bars and frozen apple-cherry juice bars, Los Angeles
Unified School District Superintendent Leonard Britton said Thursday.
   ``We're delighted to report that apples will be back in school
and that they are absolutely safe,'' said district spokeswoman Diana
Munatones.
   The district still will withhold other apple products, including
apple sauce and canned apple slices, from school menus until test
results are delivered next week, officials said.
   Meanwhile, shipments of Washington apples dropped by 152,000
boxes in the past week, a sign that consumer sales are being hurt by
the Alar scare, an industry official said today in Yakima, Wash.
   The weekly report of out-of-state shipments of the nation's
largest apple crop showed a drop from 1.56 million boxes two weeks
ago to 1.4 million boxes last week. Each box contains 42 pounds of
apples.
   The announcement in the nearly 600,000-student district coincided
with similar pronouncements by the federal Environmental Protection
Agency, Food and Drug Administration and Department of Agriculture.
In a separate statement, the EPA, FDA and the Agriculture Department
said, ``The federal government believes that it is safe for
Americans to eat apples.''
   Although the EPA has acknowledged the link between daminozide and
cancer, James Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, said Thursday
he considers the health risk insufficient at current use and residue
levels to warrant its removal from the market.
   The chemical is used by apple growers to regulate the ripening
rate of apples and to prolong shelf life.
   School district business service administrator Beth Louargand
said she didn't regret the weeklong apple ban.
   ``Our first concern is to be absolutely sure that children are
safe,'' Louargand said.

   The Senate on Friday confirmed President Bush's
selection of Lawrence Eagleburger for deputy secretary of state.
   Bush's nomination of Eagleburger for the No. 2 post at the State
Department was approved by voice vote shortly after the senators
confirmed Dick Cheney for secretary of defense.
   The choice of Eagleburger had been approved a day earlier by the
Foreign Relations Committee, 19-0. That tally even included the vote
of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who spent two days questioning the
nominee's business relations with former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger.
   The nominee clearly had the favor of the committee, as senator
after senator praised Eagleburger repeatedly for what they called
his distinguished 30-year career in government.
   The action on Eagleburger came after the Senate's bitter battle
over the failed nomination of John Tower for defense secretary.
Eagleburger quipped while under some intense questioning by Helms
that ``I have the uncomfortable feeling that I'm a test-tube case
here.''
   Helms maintained that his questions about Eagleburger's dealings
with the consulting firm Kissinger Associates weren't out of line in
light of attention given to Tower's earnings from defense
contractors.

   The leftist Sandinista government today
released almost 1,900 former National Guardsmen, most of them jailed
since the 1979 revolution that ousted President Anastasio Somoza.
   The prisoners were freed in a ceremony at the Jorge Navarro Penal
Rehabilitation Center in Tipitapa, 15 miles east of Managua, where
the guardsmen were being held.
   The release was a first step in complying with an agreement by
Central American presidents on democratization in Nicaragua and the
eventual disbanding of U.S.-supported guerrillas that have been
fighting the Sandinista government.
   President Daniel Ortega presided over the release, accompanied by
the secretary general of the Organization of American States, Joao
Baena Soares; the minister of the interior, Tomas Borge; and Bishop
Bosco Vivas, a vicar of the Roman Catholic church in Managua.
   More than a thousand friends and family members waited at the
edge of the road near the penitentiary for the release. The Red
Cross said it was providing 60 buses to take the former guardsmen to
their homes throughout the nation.
   Most of the 1,894 prisoners had been jailed since the Sandinistas
came to power. The National Guard was disbanded after the overthrow
of Somoza.
   The National Assembly on Tuesday approved an amnesty for the
former guardsmen. The release was scheduled for Sunday but was moved
ahead to today.
   The assembly, however, refused to grant amnesty to 39 other
detainees who it said had committed ``atrocious crimes'' against the
Nicaraguan people.
   The government has also asked the United Nations to monitor the
country's elections, set for February 1990, and the 10-month
political campaign, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.
   Ortega asked the assembly to grant the pardons under a peace
accord he signed in El Salvador on Feb. 14 with the presidents of
that country, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica.
   Ortega also agreed to adopt democratic reforms and move up the
date of general elections by 10 months to February 1990.
   In exchange, the presidents agreed to draft a plan to dismantle
the 11,000-member Nicaraguan rebel army, known as the Contras, who
are now in base camps in Honduras. Their forces have faded since the
United States cut off most military aid to them early last year.
   Roman Catholic Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo told Ortega during
a meeting Wednesday that the amnesty should be extended to all
jailed guardsmen and political prisoners, including 1,500 rebels in
Nicaraguan jails.
   The opposition Permanent Human Rights Commission says 6,000
people are in jail accused of aiding the Contras. Ortega has said
all Nicaraguan political prisoners will be freed if the Contras are
disbanded.

   State Treasurer A. James Manchin
defended himself before an impeachment committee today, saying he
knew nothing of massive state losses for 1{ years because other
employees kept the information from him.
   ``Not a single witness has testified that I knew of the magnitude
of the losses,'' Manchin said.
   Manchin said he depended on then-Associate Treasurer Arnold
Margolin to run the investment office, and Margolin and his
employees did not tell him or his chief of staff about the losses,
which eventually totaled $279 million.
   ``The system failed,'' Manchin told the state House Judiciary
Committee. ``The checks didn't check. The balances didn't balance.''
   Manchin said the first he heard of the losses, the bulk of which
occurred from April to June 1987, in late November or early December
1988.
   Since then, Manchin said he has been keeping a close eye on the
investment division.
   ``No more trust in one person,'' Manchin said.
   But when Del. Rod Berry asked Manchin how much the investment
division made or lost last week, Manchin would not answer.
   ``We can get you a report on that,'' Manchin said.
   Manchin is the last witness scheduled to testify before the
committee.
   Former Gov. Arch Moore told committee on Thursday he had no idea
the consolidated investment fund was suffering losses in 1987, even
though he knew some bonds had suffered a significant drop in value.
   Moore said he learned of trouble in the investment fund in late
1988 from the private Touche Ross &amp; Co., which he had hired to
conduct an audit of state government.
   ``Had we had any idea, we certainly would have treated the
treasurer's office the same as a private investment firm giving us
professional counseling and reporting massive losses,'' Moore said.
``We would have had them on the carpet in a moment.''

<HEAD>Gandhi Will Release Secret Report About Mother's Assassination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said Friday
he will release a secret report on his mother's assassination in
order to stop ``malicious innuendo'' about what it contains.
   Indira Gandhi, who preceded her son as prime minister, was killed
in 1984 by members of her personal guard.
   India's largest English-language newspaper, the Indian Express,
declared Tuesday the report prepared by Supreme Court Justice M.P.
Thakkar says Rajendra Kumar Dhawan, Mrs. Gandhi's personal
secretary, had ``consciously or unconsciously ... facilitated the
commission of a crime.''
   ``The needle of suspicion significantly points at his complicity
or involvement,'' the paper said.
   Dhawan, 52, was dismissed after Mrs. Gandhi's death but became an
aide to Rajiv Gandhi in February.
   Excerpts published in the Indian Express accuse Dhawan of lying
during questioning and giving unconvincing explanations about
entries in his diary, including the name of one of the two assassins.
   Dhawan has refused comment on the allegations but senior
government officials, including Home Minister Buta Singh, told
Parliament he was innocent.
   After the Indian Express article appeared, opposition parties
demanded the report be made public and dissension developed in
Gandhi's governing Congress Party.
   On Wednesday, the government suspended 63 opposition members of
Parliament who shouted slogans against supression of the report.
   Earlier Friday, about 80 members from the government party said
they would tell the prime minister they would release the report if
he did not. The Congress Party members said they had obtained
extensive portions of the text.
   Gandhi told Parliament: ``The events of the past few days have
caused the people of India immense distress. I, for my part, have
relived the terrible trauma of that time.
   ``The investigations are now complete and necessary followup
action will be taken soon. Therefore, the release of the report
would no longer prejudice the course of the criminal
investigations.''
   He said the published version ``is fueling willful distortion,
malicious innuendo and irresponsible character assassination. To put
a stop to this, it is important that the full text of the report be
made public.''
   It will be given to Parliament on March 27 when it reconvenes
after a vacation, he said.
   Thakkar's inquiry ran parallel to police investigations and he
submitted the report 15 months after Mrs. Gandhi was killed on Oct.
31, 1984.
   The government withheld it, citing national security. Gandhi told
lawmakers Thakkar wanted the report be kept secret because it might
jeopardize criminal investigations.
   Mrs. Gandhi was killed in the garden of her New Delhi residence
by two Sikh bodyguards as she walked to a television interview
accompanied by Dhawan.
   The Indian Express quoted the report as saying Dhawan ``fell
behind her just in the nick of the time as they were approaching the
scene of the assassination.''
   One assassin was shot and killed by other guards minutes later
and the other was convicted of murder and hanged in January. A third
Sikh, convicted of conspiracy, also was hanged.

   Money has been raised to keep the Landsat
earth-sensing satellites going for at least four months, the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration told Congress on
Friday.
   The satellites had been threatened with shutdown on March 31
because of a lack of money, but passing the hat among agencies that
use information from Landsat has generated enough pledges to keep
the satellites operating.
   The Defense Department pledged $3 million; $1.6 million will come
from satellite operating receipts; $1 million from the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration; $500,000 from the Interior
Department, and $300,000 from the Department of Agriculture, said
Dr. William E. Evans, Commerce under secrtetary for oceans and
atmospheres.
   The Landsat satellites, which collect information used in
mapping, locating mineral resources and assessing agricultural and
other land features, are operated by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, which is under Evans.
   The budget problem was caused by the fact that the two satellites
are past their anticipated lifetimes and planners had not expected
them to last this long. A replacement is to be launched in a year or
so, and that has been funded.
   Asked what will happen when the new financing runs out in four
months, Evans told the House Appropriations commerce subcommittee
that he is not sure, but he wants to be cautious about committing
large amounts of money. ``Nature may solve the problem by shutting
down'' the satellites, he commented.
   Evans' comments came at a hearing on the proposed $1.06 billion
budget for NOAA, which he said will allow the agency to concentrate
on three primary areas: coastal zone research and development,
modernization of the National Weather Service and research into
global climate change.

<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paraguay's attorney general pledged
Friday to reopen dozens of lawsuits filed by Paraguayans who alleged
they were tortured by police during the regime of deposed Gen.
Alfredo Stroessner.
   ``I will personally make sure those suits already filed are
located and reactivated,'' the official, Diogenes Martinez, said
after meeting with human rights attorneys and people who allege they
were victims of torture.
   ``We want to make sure the abuses that happened in the past are
not repeated, and we are committed to clarifying the facts and
punishing the guilty,'' said Martinez, who received a folder of 42
criminal suits from the group.
   Stroessner was toppled in a Feb. 3 coup by Gen. Andres Rodriguez,
who pledged he would respect human rights.
   Justice and police authorities recently suspended from duty two
members of the Asuncion police department who were accused of
torture, but the authorities said no further action could be taken
until formal charges were filed.
   The suspended police officers, Augusto Caceres Spelt and Carmilo
Almada Saprissa, were named in several of the cases presented to
Martinez, said human rights lawyer Francisco Vargas.
   ``There are many, many more cases besides the ones we have
presented today,'' Vargas said.
   The Interior Ministry has started an investigation of another
officer mentioned in the suits, the chief of a Department of
Investigation section in the Asuncion police department, Alberto
Cantero.
   Feliz Bogado Gondra, a medical doctor, said he was beaten and
repeatedly submerged in water in 1977 because of his alleged links
with guerrillas and communists. Cantero conducted the torture,
Bogado Gonda said.
   ``The dunking is the worst. It gives you the sensation of death
and makes you sign anything they want,'' the 43-year-old Bogado
Gondra said.
   Author Jorge Canese also charged Cantero with directing his 1977
torture by dunking for activism in a university magazine that
criticized the government.
   ``Cantero was the one who would direct the tortures with a
walkie-talkie,'' said Canese, 41.

<HEAD>Treasury Blocks Decision to Ban Import of More Weapons</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout with Treasury Department spokesman saying it

<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department may ban imports of
additional kinds of semiautomatic weapons, following earlier
suspension of imports of five types, a spokesman said today.
   The Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is still
reviewing the uses of all types of semiautomatics that are imported,
but has not reached a decision on whether to suspend importation of
more models than the five types banned from import this week, said
Jerry Rudden, spokesman for the BATF.
   ``The process is ongoing. Additional firearms may very well be
added to the list ... Large numbers of firearms are being looked
at,'' he said.
   But he said a report that the BATF had added some weapons to the
list and then changed its mind was erroneous.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen had said earlier that she
understood such a decision had been made by BATF but that it was
done ``without any pressure or direction from any other agency,''
including the White House and the Treasury Department hierarchy.
   Chief of Staff John Sununu's office also heard that BATF might
add more weapons to its suspension, said a Sununu aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity. The aide said he called BATF officials to
learn if that was true and was told that the bureau was still
evaluating the matter and had no announcement planned on expanding
the ban.
   The aide said he was only seeking information and the call did
not indicate any White House pressure, although the lobbyist for the
National Rifle Association, Wayne LaPierre, met with Sununu Thursday
while Bush was traveling in Texas and Colorado.
   The meeting lasted less than 10 minutes, Sununu's aide said, and
did not involve discussion of a potential expanded suspension.
LaPierre brought a copy of the NRA's public comment on the
suspension, and discussed some concerns about legislation in
Congress.
   NRA officials refused comment today on any of their contacts with
the administration.
   The Washington Post reported today that BATF had intended on
Thursday to announce it would supplement an import ban announced two
days earlier on such weapons as the Uzi and AK-47.
   The newspaper said the Treasury Department squelched the plan
under pressure from NRA officials.
   The NRA has reacted publicly with caution on the administration's
suspension of some imports. It did not directly criticize the move.
   An administration source said the White House has received many
calls from gun-control opponents who are worried about the precedent
the action could set with regard to domestically produced weapons.
   ``It's arguably the hottest issue out there,'' the official said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Vice President Dan Quayle said the day after the ban was
announced Tuesday that he had received several calls in that vein.
   The ban covered five types that accounted for 80 percent of the
semiautomatic imports, officials said.
   William J. Bennett, the administration's director of drug control
policy, called for the temporary ban because of the popularity of
the weapons, with their rapid-fire ability and large-capacity
ammunition clips, with drug dealers.
   An AK-47 was used by a mentally unbalanced drifter to kill five
children in a Stockton, Calif., schoolyard.

<DATELINE>GIZA PLATEAU, Egypt (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ancient mummy of an aristocratic
young woman, her Mona Lisa smile frozen in a plaster death mask, has
been unearthed in a shallow pit at the foot of the Great Pyramid of
Cheops.
   ``She's really lovely,'' said Aly Hassan, director of pharaonic
monuments for the Egyptian Antiquities Organization. Hassan dated
the mummy as 4,400 years old, one of the earliest ever found in
Egypt.
   Egyptologists expressed surprise at Thursday's discovery, noting
the Giza pyramids area has been looted repeatedly since antiquity
and excavated by some of the greatest archaeologists of the last two
centuries.
   Hassan said the seals of the grave were intact when an
antiquities inspector accidentally found the burial shaft.
   Officials who entered the grave found the mummy. She wore a
bronze crown covered with gold leaf on her head and jewelry around
her neck.
   Jewelry, pottery, wooden items, a piece of glass, flint,
obsidian, a clove of garlic and more than a dozen teeth lay nearby.
The wood and garlic may have been placed in the grave to keep
insects away.
   The mummy was not identified, but Hassan said the woman's
nobility was established both by the finery buried with her and the
site of her burial, a cemetery reserved for officials of the ruling
court.
   She was about 22 years old when she died and stood five feet
tall, Hassan said. He said the body dates from the Fifth Dynasty,
which lasted from 2465 B.C. to 2323 B.C. He said he dated her body
from that dynasty because other bodies in the cemetery were from
that period.
   Her body is so dried out that it has been wrapped in foam for
protection and bound beneath the head.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the Giza area, said the new
mummy might have been an important person reburied for safekeeping
in the shaft where she was found.
   Two vast cemeteries lie under Giza Plateau, one with royal tombs
to the east of the Cheops pyramid. To the west lies the one with the
new mummy, put into use five years into the reign of Cheops 4,600
years ago.
   Inspectors have identified the owner of the complex in which the
shaft was found as S-ankh Ptah, but his position under the pharaohs
and his relation with the mummy remain mysteries.
   Egyptologists hope the mummy can provide clues into early
mummification, an art of preservation that spanned more than 3,000
years of Egyptian history into Christian times.
   ``Any find in the Giza area in such a condition is a great
addition to archaeology,'' said Hassan. ``This mummy changes our
concept of preservation and mummification and provides a new date
for (it).''
   The earliest true mummy is that of Waty, found in the tomb of a
court singer called Nefer at Sakkara. Waty's mummy dates from the
late Fifth Dynasty and was preserved so well by resin-soaked
bandages that even a callus on the sole of a foot is visible.
   Egyptians mummified their dead for thousands of years and was
refined over the ages using a solution of naturally occurring
preservative compounds.
   An obstacle to unraveling mysteries that still surround the
mummification process is that the ancients left incomplete pictorial
records of the embalming ritual.
   Some say the art of mummification was too sacred to be revealed.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing two crashes in a week's time, the Air
Force said Friday it had grounded its fleet of H-3 helicopters from
all but emergency missions as a safety precaution.
   The flight restriction order, which is indefinite in length, will
allow the choppers ``to fly search-and-rescue missions but restrict
all other flying until a thorough investigation has been
completed,'' the Air Force said.
   ``Once the command can assure adequate flight safety, the fleet
will be returned to full operational status.''
   The restrictions affect 33 H-3s assigned to active duty Air Force
units and 27 assigned to the Air National Guard or Air Force
Reserve, the service said.
   The order follows a crash last Sunday night in the Arizona desert
in which 15 servicemen were killed. On Tuesday, another H-3 crashed
in the ocean off the coast of Japan while on a routine
search-and-rescue training mission, killing three.
   The Air Force has said it has no evidence suggesting the two
crashes were caused by the same problem. The precautionary grounding
order was issued, however, because accidents with the H-3 are fairly
unusual, the service added.
   In the past six years, there have been only four major accidents
with the H-3.
   The H-3 series of helicopters was designed in the late 1950s and
early 1960s and used extensively in Vietnam. Nicknamed the ``Jolly
Green Giant,'' the helicopter is still flown by the Navy and Coast
Guard in addition to the Air Force.
   The Navy said Friday it was aware of the Air Force's action, but
had not issued any similar grounding order.
   Earlier this month, the Air Force temporarily grounded all of its
H-3s for a one-time inspection of the main rotor head shaft nut, a
huge nut that holds the rotor blade assembly to the main engine
shaft.
   That grounding was ordered after the Air Force said it had
discovered that defective nuts had been received from a spare parts
contractor. The Air Force said both of the helicopters that crashed
this week had undergone those mandatory inspections and were flying
with good shaft nuts.

   The old custom of decorating Easter egg trees
is as much a part of the holiday in some homes as Easter baskets,
and now it's spreading.
   ``This year, we're expecting about 100 percent growth rate over
last year,'' said Barry Vaill, owner of the Country Christmas Store,
which begins stocking Easter trees almost as soon as the season ends
for the Christmas versions.
   Some people snip spring branches and spray-paint them white or
other colors, and others decorate artificial Christmas trees or even
house plants with Easter-theme baubles.
   The Exeter-based store, which displays roughly a dozen Easter
trees of differing themes, expects to sell about 100 trees ranging
from $20 to $250, he said. Some are table-height and others are up
to 7 or 8 feet tall.
   The trees have religious meaning to some and are simply festive
to others.
   Years ago, when Emily Nero, 59, of Providence first started
decorating an Easter tree after seeing the idea in a magazine,
virtually all her ornaments were hand made.
   ``You can make them _ it's more traditional,'' she said as she
shopped for ornaments. ``But the ones you can buy are beautiful and
they save time.''
   The Country Christmas Store stocks decorations of porcelain,
glass, papier mache, wood and ceramic made in countries like Taiwan
and West Germany. In addition to the traditional egg shape, people
can decorate trees with Easter bunnies, chicks, lambs, ribbons and
the like.
   ``The manufacturers got smart about four years ago'' and started
coming out with Easter decorations, said Vaill. The selection has
grown ever since, he said, calling this year ``the best I've ever
seen in terms of variety.''
   The origins of the egg tree have been lost in oblivion, according
to the book, ``An Egg at Easter: A Folklore Study,'' by Newall
Venetia.
   The practice is enjoying new popularity because ``people are
going back to the old-fashioned ways of doing things, where they
decorate their house for Christmas and Halloween _ passing the
tradition down from generation to generation,'' Vaill said.
   ``It's kind of fun,'' said Lisa Goyette, 24, of Providence, who
continues the custom she grew up with. ``When you grow older and you
don't have Easter baskets, the tree makes it festive.''
   Goyette said her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, decorates an
egg tree because it symbolizes rebirth and rejuvenation. The tree at
her mother's Eastham, Mass., home, is decorated on Palm Sunday and
stays up until Easter Sunday.
   In some places, it has become such a tradition that the entire
town participates.
   In Decatur, Ind., the practice of decorating a public Easter tree
with hundreds of eggs began in 1951, said Joyce Iliff, director of
the Decatur Pulbic Library, where the tree is displayed.
   The town originated the yearly custom a year after publication of
the book, ``The Egg Tree,'' by Kathleen Milhous.
   Vaill said decorating Easter trees is a natural welcoming of the
springtime.
   ``Easter is a breath of fresh air. After Christmas, when it's
cold and dreary and it's dark. Even football's over,'' he said.
   ``Whether they go get a branch out of the back yard and spray
paint it white, or whether they're buying one of our trees, people
are doing one or the other,'' said Vaill.

   Leftist rebels want to disrupt and discredit
El Salvador's presidential election as a means of forcing new
negotiations on their offer to join the political process, two of
their leaders said.
   ``We want to weaken the electoral process so much that the
results are not seen as legitimate,'' said Mario Lopez, a member of
the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front's political commission.
   ``That will open the door to our proposals,'' Lopez said Thursday
in an interview at the front's Mexico City offices.
   The rebels contend Sunday's election will be fraudulent and
unrepresentative, and they believe their boycott will help prove it.
   Their theory holds that talks will begin when all other solutions
are seen to fail; that if death squads, elections and U.S. aid
cannot pacify the nation, perhaps all sides will see negotiations as
the only alternative.
   ``Reality imposes itself on everybody's dreams, including our
own,'' said Ana Guadalupe Martinez, another member of the political
commission who spoke with The Associated Press.
   Rebel leaders offered to participate if the election was delayed
six months and a fair vote was guaranteed. When their proposal
failed, they called for a boycott, threatened election workers and
stopped traffic throughout the country with threats to attack
vehicles and drivers.
   They also launched several attacks, including one with rocket
grenades on the presidential palace that wounded seven people.
   Despite their boycott, the rebels have said supporting the
leftist Democratic Convergence is a valid option for Salvadorans.
The party is running third in polls to the right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena, and the incumbent Christian
Democrats.
   Ms. Martinez said guerrilla leaders knew the boycott would affect
the leftist party's showing but they feel the total vote against the
status quo includes those who do not vote or cast ballots that are
blank or defaced.
   Guillermo Ungo, the Convergence presidential candidate, has asked
the guerrillas to call off the boycott, comparing the rebel alliance
to a woman ``who wants to jump into bed but still remain a virgin.''
   ``That sounds like Dr. Ungo, all right,'' Ms. Martinez said,
laughing.
   ``The Convergence wasn't going to win anyway,'' she added, ``but
they need to play a respectable political role.''
   She and Lopez admitted the rebels risk being seen as the culprits
even if they succeed in discrediting the election, but Ms. Martinez
said: ``This war didn't start with these elections. It has deeper
causes'' and the guerrillas have made ``responsible gestures towards
negotiations.''
   Arena leads in the polls but a runoff is possible. If one is
needed, it would be held in April, and the two officials said the
offer of negotiations might be renewed before that.
   ``We'll have to evaluate the election results, and whether our
strategy worked,'' Lopez said.
   Ms. Martinez said the guerrillas hope their strategy will work
even if the winner is Alfredo Cristiani, the Arena candidate, but
added: ``Cristiani has a moderate image but that may not have
anything to do with the interests he represents.''
   She said she fears Roberto d'Aubuisson, a former army officer who
who founded Arena. D'Aubuisson has been linked to death squads but
denies the allegations.
   ``D'Aubuisson may be the power behind the throne,'' Ms. Martinez
said, but nine years of war and 70,000 deaths are factors in favor
of negotiations.
   ``They tried death squads and they couldn't pacify the country,''
she said. ``How can they try that again?''

<HEAD>Police Gear Up for Teens Headed To Spring Break's Popular Desert
Oasis</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bolstered police force started
working 12-hour shifts Friday for the annual hard partying of Easter
week spring break that kicked off this year with St. Patrick's Day
tippling.
   ``Oh sure, we are going to have a great time,'' police Lt. John
Clem said sarcastically on the eve of the Easter Week influx in
which the desert oasis' population swells from the year-round 40,000
to 100,000.
   In addition to St. Patrick's Day, the holiday also was ushered in
Friday with the California Angels exhibition baseball opener.
   ``We are going to watch the girls, play baseball and drink green
Slurpees,'' said Clem.
   High school and college students bent on celebrating booze, sun
and one another traditionally descend on this resort city 110 miles
east of Los Angeles each spring.
   Police crowd control tactics of rigid enforcement and high
visibility were adopted after a near-riot in 1986 when unruly toughs
harassed motorists, pulled off women's clothes and hurled bottles.
   The 81-member police force started 12-hour shifts Friday with
help from a contingent of Riverside County sheriff's deputies and
California Highway Patrol officers.
   Supermarkets had amply stocked their shelves, hotels prepared
identification bracelets for guests and fast food restaurants
prepared for huge crowds.
   ``We are encouraging the kids to come. As long as they bring
their manners along with them they are welcome here,'' said Clem.
   But he warned: ``We want them to know they will be put in the
slam if they misbehave. And if they are minors, mom and dad will be
called to come and get them.''
   In addition to a tan, the most coveted Palm Springs spring break
souvenirs are $13 T-shirts with the image of Mayor Sonny Bono,
formerly half of the pop group Sonny and Cher, and the words: ``I
Want You Babe in Palm Springs.''
   ``We've already sold 10,000 of them,'' said city spokeswoman Ann
Erdman.
   Besides a week of baseball at Angels Stadium, the Oasis Water
Park on Gene Autry Trail is sponsoring concerts by hard rockers Bad
Company and games that will include ``the world's largest squirt gun
fight.''
   The squirt gun competition is one of the Springs Games USA events
that pits records set by youths in Daytona Beach, Fla., against
their contemporaries in Palm Springs.
   ``It is designed to provide a healthy alternative for the kids,''
said Erdman.
   The youths also will get a shot at $25,000. Spring Games
headquarters in Daytona Beach and Palm Springs will conduct
auditions for May's two-week ``College Championship'' edition of the
``Jeopardy!'' television game show.

<TEXT>
   Joseph L. Mankiewicz, the 80-year-old
filmmaker who won four Academy Awards by 1950, says he is
disillusioned with the Hollywood of today.
   ``And I know _ and I'm very sad _ that American film has become,
in my opinion, the major motivation for the American being as
detested as he is throughout the world,'' Mankiewicz said.
   ``All they see in American movies is variations on obscenity,
boozing and (sex),'' Mankiewicz told reporters Wednesday.
   On Thursday, Mankiewicz received the 1989 Akira Kurosawa Award
for Lifetime Achievement from the San Francisco International Film
Festival. He was the fourth recipient, and the first American.
   Mankiewicz produced ``The Philadelphia Story'' and ``Woman of the
Year.'' He won his two Academy Awards _ for best direction and best
screenplay _ in 1949 for ``A Letter To Three Wives.'' In 1950, he
won the same two Oscars for ``All About Eve.''
   Among other films, he wrote and directed ``Julius Caeser,''
``Guys And Dolls,'' ``The Barefoot Contessa,'' and ``The Late George
Apley.'' His last film as director was ``Sleuth'' in 1972.
   He not only made movies. He made news.
   During the McCarthy era, it was Mankiewicz who provided
much-needed leadership within the Directors Guild. He also recalled
that his ``No Way Out,'' among the first films to focus on race
problems in America, was banned in Chicago and ``shown in about four
theaters in the South.''

<TEXT>
   A credit card is all movie-lovers need to
buy tickets, popcorn and candy at a new suburban Washington theater,
but owners said Friday most patrons probably aren't ready to leave
their cash at home.
   ``I think we have a lifetime of cash transactions to overcome,''
said Dick Dodderidge, senior vice president for corporate marketing
of Kansas City-based American Multi-Cinema Inc. ``People obviously
are not used to whipping out a credit card when they go to the movie
theatre, so I think it's going to take a while for it to catch on.''
   By midday Friday, the opening day for the new AMC Courthouse
Plaza 8 Theaters, eight people had telephoned ahead to charge
tickets and concession stand vouchers, said manager Charlie
Stoessel. The theater began accepting credit card reservations
Tuesday.
   The Courthouse Plaza is the first U.S. cinema to have electronic
facilities for credit card transactions incorporated into its
design, although AMC began experimenting with the idea at a Kansas
theater several weeks ago, said Dodderidge.
   The theatre charges a 50-cent handling fee for telephoned advance
credit card reservations, which don't save specific seats but let
moviegoers avoid long ticket lines the day of a show, said Stoessel.
There is no extra charge for charges made in person.
   The computerized automatic ticket sales system can register
credit cards as quickly as cash, with a quick flick through a
scanning device, Dodderidge said. AMC imported the system from the
United Kingdom, where the credit concept has become popular over the
past three years.
   Another local chain, K-B Theatres, also plans to introduce credit
card transactions.
   ``We want to see how it works out for them first,'' said KB
general manager John Bailey. ``We think it will give our theatres an
edge. When people are trying to decide between one theatre and
another, that may be the thing that helps them make a decision.''
   Moviegoers have not been flocking to put their movie tickets on
plastic at a theatre in Overland Park, Kan., where AMC has been
testing the concept for three weeks. Credit card transactions at the
Oak Park Plaza have accounted for about 1{ percent of ticket sales _
up from six-tenths of 1 percent the first week, said manager Keith
Weidenkeller.
   ``It's growing,'' Weidenkeller said. ``Everybody that uses it
seems to want to use it again. I think it will just keep going. The
general response is, `Well, it's about time.'''
   ``It's all so new. We really don't know what to expect,'' said
Dodderidge.

<HEAD>De Klerk Denies Power Struggle, Calls For Patience</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the governing
National Party denied Friday that he was attempting to oust
President P.W. Botha but conceded that their awkward relationship
needed to be clarified.
   The main white opposition party meanwhile said National Party
leader F.W. de Klerk lacked the political strength to complete the
``mini-coup'' he launched while Botha was recovering from a stroke.
   De Klerk, the education minister, became head of the National
Party on Feb. 2 when Botha resigned from the post two weeks after
suffering a stroke.
   The National Party's parliamentary caucus resolved this week that
it wants de Klerk to become president. However, Botha returned to
office Wednesday and has made clear he will remain in his post
indefinitely, regardless of the wishes of his party.
   ``It is my and my party's wish that the relationship with (Botha)
shall remain warm, sincere and healthy,'' de Klerk said in
Parliament in Cape Town. ``Be calm. We will find a sensible way.''
   De Klerk also said that a new constitution _ presumably one that
would include the black majority _ would have to be introduced to
replace the one Botha helped introduce in 1984.
   ``The National Party remains committed to its goal of power
sharing,'' said de Klerk. ``A new constitution, differing
substantially from what we have today, must come about.''
   The role of the president would have to be ``reviewed
drastically,'' de Klerk added.
   Under South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation,
the country's 5 million whites maintain political and economic
control over the country's 28 million blacks, who have no vote in
national affairs.
   De Klerk has been depicted as more pragmatic and flexible than
Botha, although they appear to agree on most major policy issues.
   In recent speeches, de Klerk has called for race reform, but has
not put forward any specific proposals. Also, he has emphasized his
commitment to continued segregation of white neighborhoods and
schools.
   Ferdie Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the extreme right
Conservative Party, said de Klerk wanted to oust Botha, but lacked
the political strength to do so.
   ``The whole of South Africa can be behind (de Klerk), he still
knows he cannot match P.W. Botha in a man-to-man contest ... he is
too weak.''
   Hartzenberg, whose party favors strict segregation, also
questioned de Klerk's commitment to sharing power with blacks.
   ``Mr. de Klerk does not even want to share power with the state
president, let alone other groups.''

<HEAD>Chinese Official Warns of More Protests in Tibet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The head of the Chinese Communist Party in Tibet
said Tibetan activists may defy martial law and adopt ``new
methods'' to fight Chinese rule of the remote region, the official
press said Friday.
   A Tibetan, contacted by telephone in Lhasa, said the city was
quiet on the 30th anniversary of the flight of Tibet's spiritual
leader, the Dalai Lama, from his homeland to India during an
uprising against Chinese rule.
   He said police and soldiers were posted throughout the city and
arrests continued of Tibetans suspected of taking part in three days
of protests last week. At least 16 people were reported killed in
the protests.
   Tibetans contacted on March 10, after foreign tourists were
expelled from the city, reported large-scale roundups by Chinese
security forces.
   A Nepalese businessman said the city was ``very quiet'' but that
authorities had not let him leave his hotel.
   The People's Daily quoted party leader Hu Jintao as saying the
situation in Lhasa ``was reaching stability'' after 10 days of
martial law.
   ``But a minority of (separatists) will not let the matter drop,''
he was quoted as saying. ``They might switch their tricks and adopt
new methods of opposition. Because of this we must raise our
vigilance.''
   Hu did not elaborate as to what new methods of protest Tibetans
might use.
   Last week, an official at the provincial office of Tibet reported
scattered cases of rock throwing by Tibetans defying martial law.
   Hu said the riots were the most violent since protests against
nearly four decades of Communist rule began in September 1987.
   In Friday's report, the People's Daily said the demonstrators
concentrated their attacks on government and party buildings, police
stations and facilities belonging to the state-run news media.
   Twenty-four government and party buildings, 99 private
Chinese-owned businesses, more than 20 automobilies, scores of
bicycles and three-wheeled motorcars were destroyed in the riots,
the report said.
   The martial law has led to fears that China will adopt an even
harder line toward the remote mountainous region. But Hu was quoted
as saying Tibet would be reopened to foreign tourists once martial
law was lifted.
   Martial law was ordered after three days of protests began March
5, leaving 16 dead and about 100 people injured by official count.
Tibetans said that between 20 and 30 people died.
   The March protests came as Tibetans tried to commemorate the one
year anniversary of an anti-Chinese clash with police that left an
estimated 24 people dead.
   Beijing claims that Tibet has been part of China since the 13th
century. Tibetans contend their homeland was independent for most of
that time.
   The goals of the protests have been to express four decades of
anger over what is perceived as alien rule and possibly win outside
support. Independence remains a vague concept among the protesters,
who call simply for the return of the Dalai Lama to power.

   Budget negotiators will start exchanging offers
next week and Democrats will push to make military cuts equal to
domestic spending cuts in fiscal 1990, the chairman of the House
Budget Committee said Friday.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., following a negotiating session with
White House representatives, said the two sides talked about
President Bush's plan to increase military spending but freeze
domestic programs to meet the deficit targets of the Gramm-Rudman
law.
   ``I made the point that from a congressional point of view,
Gramm-Rudman has established the principle that... you get equal
amounts out of defense and non-defense,'' Panetta said.
   Richard Darman, the director of the president's Office of
Management and Budget, declined to comment on Friday's meeting.
   Panetta said he and Senate Budget Committee Chairman Jim Sasser,
D-Tenn., planned to work together in drafting a Democratic budget
proposal. In addition to the balance between domestic and military
spending cuts, Panetta said he wants new revenues to equal the
overall spending cuts.
   ``We're going to start exchanging offers and the direction I'm
heading in is basically to do dollar for dollar,'' he said.
   In addition to the White House-congressional budget talks Friday,
Sasser convened his committee on Friday to officially begin drafting
a budget, in parallel to the talks with the administration. He and
other committee members pointed out the insistent demands for new
federal spending, for cleaning up nuclear plants, bailing out
savings and loans, education, health care, defense, and a wide swath
of other programs.
   ``The overwhelming impression is a radical mismatch between the
ends most of us acknowledge, and the means we have at our disposal
for reaching them,'' Sasser said.
   Sen. James Exon, D-Neb., and several other members of the
committee expressed frustration that, despite claims it would turn
things around, the deficit has begun going up again under
Gramm-Rudman.
   ``The Gramm-Rudman law reduces deficit, and not deficit
estimates,'' he said.

   The Prince of Wales, after a
much-touted plan to star in an international polo tournament in the
United Arab Emirates, did not show up at all on Friday.
   People who spent up to $260 for the privilege of watching Charles
swing his mallet at the Dubai Polo Club were told that Charles had
been advised by Britain not to play ``for security reasons.''
   Charles left later in the day for a two-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
   Iran has criticized the tour of the Gulf states that Charles and
his wife, the Princess of Wales, started Sunday.
   Iran broke relations with Britain on March 7, accusing it of
trying to undermine Islam by supporting British novelist Salman
Rushdie and his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' Moslems consider the
book blasphemous and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued an execution
order against Rushdie.
   Tehran radio accused the British government of exploiting the
royal tour to ``give a cold shoulder to the world Moslems,'' warning
that Britain would face their ``wrath.''
   Charles and Diana made stops in Kuwait and Bahrain before
arriving in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.

   After spending countless nights in hotels
on the campaign trail, former presidential candidate George McGovern
has become an innkeeper himself.
   McGovern helped celebrate the grand opening Thursday of the
renovated Stratford Inn, the 150-room motel he bought last year for
$1 million from the Irish Hotel Group Inc.
   ``I've been in politics for 30 years and I spent a third of that
in hotels and inns,'' the fit-looking, 66-year-old former senator
from South Dakota said. The inn is McGovern's first business venture.
   McGovern, who left the Senate in 1980, has been making weekly
trips to the motel to direct $500,000 worth of renovations.
   He and his wife, Eleanor, will stay in the motel's newly renamed
McGovern suite when they are not on the road.
   McGovern said he will continue on the lecture circuit, leaving
day-to-day operations to his manager, James O'Donnell, and
O'Donnell's assistant, McGovern's 35-year-old son, Steven.
   McGovern met O'Donnell several years ago, when a fire destroyed
McGovern's apartment in Washington and he and his wife took up
temporary residence at the Normandy Inn, also run by the Irish Hotel
Group.
   When the company decided to divest its American holdings,
O'Donnell called McGovern, who had expressed interest in owning a
hotel.

   Multimillionaire bond trader Michael Milken, the
subject of a federal securities fraud probe, was warmly received by
chief executives of some of the nation's biggest companies at a
black-tie dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
   The audience gave Milliken two standing ovations during his
speech to Financial World magazine's ``CEO of the Decade'' dinner
Thursday night.
   It was Milken's first public appearance in New York since Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to fire him and withhold his 1988 pay as
part of a plea deal with the government.
   In his speech, Milken did not address charges that include
insider trading in a Securities and Exchange Commission suit against
Drexel that names him.
   He made one oblique reference to his status when he noted he had
a cold, and said, ``In the past two years I have been learning about
rights I no longer have. I was afraid they were trying to take away
my right to speak, but the doctors of New York have told me I will
be all right.''
   Milken, 42, has received a target letter from the government
indicating that he will be indicted on criminal fraud and other
charges.
   Milken defended a wave of management-led buyouts, debt-leveraged
corporate expansions and employee stock ownership programs that he
said have ``allowed employees to once again have a stake in this
country.''

   Using footage from the classic children's film
``The Wizard of Oz,'' the National Association of Social Workers
launched a national campaign Friday to highlight the issue of
homelessness, especially as it affects families with children.
   ``The point obviously is that Dorothy discovered `there's no
place like home,''' said NASW spokeswoman Lucy Sanchez, referring to
the role portrayed by Judy Garland, who is swept away by a tornado
from her Kansas home into the fantasyland of Oz.
   ``But for 3 million Americans, home is no place,'' said Sanchez.
   The association selected Dorothy's heel-clicking refrain for its
annual theme to assure the public doesn't become desensitized to the
issue of homelessness when families with children represent the
fastest growing segment of the homeless population, said NASW
Executive Director Mark Battle.
   The campaign comes as Hollywood readies a 50th anniversary
celebration for the 1939 movie and association members' work is
recognized during Social Work Month in March.
   The 30-second public service announcements will air on radio and
television stations during March and April in cities including Los
Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, Detroit, Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver,
Philadelphia and Houston with an estimated audience of 38 million
households.
   The NASW is a 120,000-member group of social workers employed in
hospitals, business and industry, schools and government agencies.

<TEXT>
   President Gustav Husak has suffered
a mild stroke and is recovering in hospital, the official news
agency said Friday.
   The brief report from the official CTK news agency was the first
confirmation that Husak, who replaced Alexander Dubcek as Communist
Party leader after the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, was ill.
   Husak, 75, relinquished the party leadership to Milos Jakes in
December 1987 but remained a member of the 13-man ruling Politburo.
There has been persistent but unconfirmed speculation that Husak may
quit the Politburo at the Central Committee meeting scheduled for
Thursday and Friday.
   Husak presided over the ``normalization policy'' that followed
the 1968 invasion and partial occupation of Czechoslovakia by Warsaw
Pact forces, crushing Dubcek's ``Prague Spring'' economic reforms.
   Also Friday, in the southern city of Bratislava, Dubcek's wife
said Dubcek has been denied a visa to attend the Communist Party
Congress in Italy, his wife said.
   Anna Dubcek said by telephone from the couple's home that her
husband had planned to leave Friday for Italy, where the congress
begins this weekend.
   In Italy, a spokesman for the congress told the Associated Press
that the party would protest if Dubcek did not receive a visa before
the congress ends on Wednesday.

   The Soviet government Friday expanded the right to
trade with foreigners from about 100 ministries and state
enterprises to virtually all businesses in the country, the official
news agency Tass reported.
   The decree is a major deregulation in a country in which contact
with foreigners was strictly limited until a few years ago and still
causes police scrutiny in some locations.
   The move had been expected since the Council of Ministers
announced in December that it would act to expand exports by spring.
   Even cooperatives, the private businesses which share that
profits among their members, are permitted to trade.
   Foreign currency is still strictly controlled, and businesses
that earn convertible currency expect it to be heavily taxed. The
ruble is not convertible and the Soviet Union urgently needs foreign
cash to buy Western technology.
   Authorities are planning to allow Soviet businesses to buy
convertible currency like dollars in a sealed-bid auction, said
Alexander I. Potyomkin of the Foreign Economic Bank. However, so far
he has had trouble finding organizations willing to sell their
foreign currency.
   Businessmen are watching for this auction with great curiosity,
as they expect a rate of 6 to 7 rubles to the dollar would be
necessary to draw sellers. The official exchange rate is 10 times
that, at 62.24 rubles per dollar.
   Traders will still operate under considerable uncertainty,
because Tass said the Ministry for External Economic Relations is
being empowered to limit imports and exports of specific goods as it
sees fit.

<HEAD>Two Killed, 25 Injured As Medieval Tower Crumbles In Italy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A 900-year-old tower collapsed onto a square
Friday, killing two people, injuring 25 and damaging an adjacent
cathedral. Rescue workers pulled three people from the rubble.
   None of those treated at the San Matteo hospital in the northern
Italian town of Pavia were injured seriously, doctors said.
   Experts said the 255-foot tower crumbled either because of
natural decay in the mortar holding the bricks together or because
of a sudden sinking following a dry spell that lowered the water
table.
   Shortly before the thick walls toppled, several rocks fell from
the top, prompting passers-by in the square to flee, authorities
said.
   ``The toll could have been higher without that warning,'' said a
spokeswoman for Mayor Sandro Bruni.
   She said there had been no signs indicating the tower was in
danger of collapsing but added that experts had recently checked to
see if it needed restoration. The dead were identified as
52-year-old Giuseppina Casella, whose newspaper stand was buried by
the bricks, and Giulio Fontana, 62.
   After the collapse, firefighters frantically dug through a pile
of rubble at least 30 feet high and eventually pulled out two men
and a woman.
   The red bricks that fell on the downtown square buried several
parked cars and damaged several shops and one building.
   The 501-year-old Duomo cathedral, partly designed by Donato
Bramante, also suffered substantial damage.
   Bramante introduced a style of architecture combining Renaissance
ideas with experimentation that came to be known as the High
Renaissance style, which influenced European architecture for 300
years.
   He is best known for the design for St. Peter's Basilica.
   Pavia Archbishop Giovanni Volta said that the baptistery of the
Duomo cathedral and one arch of the church were cracked in Friday's
disaster.
   Residents were evacuated from two old buildings near the
collapsed tower.
   ``It's (the collapse) something due to age, which cannot be
predicted,'' said Maria Antonietta Abrate, an official of the local
government office for protection of monuments. ``It's typical of
ancient towers. It also happened to the belltower of Venice.''
   In 1902, the 1,000-year-old St. Mark Bell Tower in Venice
collapsed without warning, causing no injuries. A worldwide
fund-raising drive raised enough money to build a replica, completed
in 1912.
   Pavia, 20 miles southwest of Milan, is rich with medieval art and
architecture and is called ``the city of the 100 towers.''
   It was founded in 568 by the German tribe of the Longobards.
   Italy's most famous tower, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, has long
been judged in danger of collapsing although not in the immediate
future.

<HEAD>Man Convicted Of Killing Policeman Released On Parole</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A man sentenced to 25 years to life for
his conviction in the 1968 killing of a sheriff's deputy was
released from prison on parole Friday, after serving 14 years.
   Gary McGivern, whose release had been supported by a group of
celebrities, ``waved and said, `It's nice to be out,''' reported
James Flateau, spokesman for the state prison system.
   McGivern was granted clemency on New Year's Eve 1985 by Gov.
Mario Cuomo, making him eligible for parole. On Wednesday, the state
Board of Parole approved McGivern's third parole request.
   McGivern has maintained that he had no part in the deputy's death.
   Flateau said McGivern was picked up at the medium-security
Otisville prison by his wife, free-lance writer Marguerite Culp of
Woodstock, who led the battle to free him.
   Culp attracted support from well-known people including folk
singer Pete Seeger, conservative columnist William F. Buckley and
liberal lawyer William Kunstler.
   However, their 1978 prison marriage isn't legally recognized in
New York state because he was serving a life term at the time. For
contract purposes, lifers are considered to be legally dead and thus
cannot marry.
   Prosecutors said McGivern and co-defendant Charles Culhane were
involved in a 1968 escape attempt, while being driven to a court
appearance, in which a Westchester County deputy was killed. The
prosecution said McGivern fired the shot that killed the deputy.
   McGivern and Culhane have steadfastly maintained that a third
inmate in the car, Robert Bowerman, was the only one involved in the
escape attempt and that he shot the deputy. Bowerman also was killed.
   A second deputy in the car survived and testified that McGivern
and Culhane were involved in the escape attempt.
   McGivern and Culhane were tried three times for the deputy's
murder. The first trial ended in a hung jury. Convictions in the
second trial were overturned on appeal. They were convicted again in
1975.
   Culhane won't be eligible for parole until late 1991. Cuomo has
refused to grant him clemency.

   Relatives of slain automobile racing
promoter Mickey Thompson, Charles Manson ``family'' victim Sharon
Tate and others have launched a drive to speed up trials and
increase criminal penalties.
   The relatives of Thompson and Miss Tate announced Thursday, the
first anniversary of the racing promoter's murder, they had begun a
petition to put an initiative before voters next year.
   Miss Tate's mother, Doris, said she has gathered 352,000
signatures since 1984 from people opposing paroles for Manson's
followers who killed her actress-daughter and eight other people in
1969.
   Relatives of Thompson and his wife, Trudy, who were shot at their
home, said they decided to use the anniversary of the killing to do
something for victims' relatives.
   ``At first we didn't know how to recognize this anniversary,''
Collene Thompson Campbell, Thompson's daughter, said during the news
conference at Rose Hills Cemetery. ``We're still devastated, angry,
lonely and frustrated. We decided Mickey and Trudy would want us to
do something that would make a difference to every Californian.''
   ``Our fond hope today is that very soon the killers will be
caught and brought to justice,'' said Thompson's son, Danny. ``Now
we are preparing for that day.''
   A $260,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the Thompsons' assailants is being offered.
   The initiative, which if passed would amend the state
constitution, consists of 13 proposals ranging from changing grand
jury and preliminary hearing procedures to speeding the flow of
trials through the court system.
   The measure also would create a crime of torture, with a sentence
of life in prison, and would increase penalties for some crimes.
   A similar ballot measure last year was abandoned after it failed
to gather enough signatures.
   In the latest effort, a section pertaining to the death penalty
was deleted in the hopes of achieving more bipartisan support, said
Orange County Deputy District Attorney Jim Cloninger, one of the
initiative's authors.
   To qualify for the November 1990 ballot, measure organizers need
to collect 600,000 signatures of registered voters over 150 days. It
is expected to cost about $300,000 just to qualify the initiative.

<TEXT>
   Two members of an independent peace
group imprisoned since October were given suspended sentences of 10
months each Friday after a two-day trial.
   Anna Sabatova of the Charter 77 human rights group, who attended
the trial, said Tomas Dvorak, 23, and Hana Marvanova, 26, of the
Independent Peace Assocation were convicted of preparation to
incitement in connection with an illegal rally in October.
   More serious charges of incitement connected with an
anti-government rally in August were dropped, she said.
   Prosecutor Karel Florian appealed the suspended sentences and
filed a complaint against an order by Judge Jan Belohradsky to free
the defendants, Ms. Sabatova said.
   Florian had demanded half of the maximum three-year sentence
provided by the criminal code.
   About 50 people cheered Dvorak and Ms. Marvanova as they were led
from the court. They remained in custody Friday night.
   The trial was the latest event in a crackdown on dissent stemming
from the August and October protests and a week of unrest in January.
   Playwright Vaclav Havel was sentenced in February to nine months
in jail and seven other activists were jailed, fined or given
suspended sentences. Havel's appeal is to be heard Tuesday.
   Last week, two activists were given sentences of 6 and 16 months
for organizing a petition demanding an explanation of the death in
jail last year of dissident Pavel Wonka.
   An emigre source in Vienna said Friday that Stanislav Devaty, a
former Charter 77 spokesman detained by police outside the Prague
courtroom Thursday, was under arrest in his hometown of Gottwaldov
in Moravia.
   Police searched the homes of five people in Moravia and five in
Brno hin the previous 24 hours, the source said on condition of
anonymity.
   Charges against Dvorak and Ms. Marvanova changed several times
during their detention. CTK, the official news agency said in a
short report late Friday the original charges of hooliganism were
dropped after a presidential amnesty in October.
   Ms. Sabatova and fellow Charter 77 activist Vaclav Maly were in
the courtroom on both days of the proceedings. They were joined
Friday by Charter 77 spokesman Alexander Vondra.
   Last Aug. 21, the 20th anniversary of the Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia, Dvorak and Ms. Marvanova helped draw up a petition
read by Dvorak and including demands for free elections, release of
all political prisoners and withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   After it was read, a crowd estimated at 10,000 marched around
Prague in the first such mass protest in 19 years.
   Dvorak was arrested Oct. 22 and Ms. Marvanova Oct. 28, before the
banned rally to mark Czechoslovakia's independence in 1918. Riot
police dispersed about 5,000 people who attended.

<TEXT>
   Midwest buffalo buyers got a chance to place their
bids at an unlikely auction site this week: Fermilab _ the only U.S.
atom-smashing facility with a herd of the proud beasts.
   While scientists rammed high-energy atomic particles into each
other underground in the world's most powerful accelerator, farmers
and ranchers from Illinois and five other states on Thursday placed
bids from a flatbed truck for 64 animals being sold so Fermilab
could thin its herd before spring calving.
   ``I knew it was going to be a good sale, and it was,'' said Dan
Shepherd, president of the National Buffalo Association and owner of
320 of the animals at his farm in Clifton Hill, Mo.
   Shepherd said he was thankful the animals commanded high prices
at the auction _ an average of $1,145 each and a total of $73,300
for all 64, according to Fermilab.
   Rudy Dorner, land manager for federally owned Fermilab, or Fermi
National Accelerator Laboratory, said the facility has been in the
buffalo business on a break-even basis for about 20 years.
   ``Dr. Robert Wilson, our first director, was born in Wyoming and
loved the outdoors. And he felt bison, as representative (animals)
of the prairie in Illinois, would be a good thing to have,'' Dorner
said. ``And his idea has proven very, very popular.''
   Hundreds of visitors come on warm-weather weekends to see
Fermilab's herd, normally comprising about 80 animals, at the lab's
90-acre site 40 miles southwest of Chicago, he said.
   Besides their popularity as symbols of Americana, bison are
growing in value as food source for meat-eaters, Dorner said.
   ``It's a very healthy meat, very low in cholesterol,'' he said.
``And it's very good meat.''
   Contrary to popular belief, the bison is no longer an endangered
species. About 120,000 of them live in the United States, up from
around 1,000 at the turn of the century, Shepherd said.
   ``It's an alternative agriculture. The buffalo business has been
pretty good to us over the years. It's been a solid moneymaker,''
Shepherd said.
   Dorner said Fermilab, with more land than most other particle
accelerator facilities, is the only one in the country with a herd
of buffalo.

   A metal footbridge collapsed Friday under
the weight of several hundred people in the eastern suburb of
El-Harrach, causing four deaths and 157 injuries, state-run
television reported.
   The television newscast blamed the disaster on the poor condition
of the bridge, which it said was about 70 years old.
   It said the footbridge broke nearly in half at about 10:30 a.m.,
sending pedestrians tumbling into a river below.
   Every Friday, the El-Harrach bridge is crowded with people headed
to one of two weekly markets in the neighborhood, located between
Algiers and its airport.

   The demonstrators included a gorilla, birds,
and a dog wearing a trench coat, but the cause was not animal rights
but ``mascot rights,'' specifically the right of Cubby to entertain
spring-training fans of the Chicago Cubs.
   James Kopf, who has doubled as the Cubs' unofficial mascot at
spring training for the past eight seasons, said he learned earlier
this year he wouldn't be welcome at HoHoKam Park.
   A letter from HoHoKams, a civic organization that runs the park
during spring training, said officials were concerned about
liability insurance. Kopf is not employed by the Cubs.
   Nearly a dozen of Cubby's fellow mascots took up his cause in a
march around the ballpark Thursday led by the Phoenix Suns Gorilla.
   ``It's a crime that they won't let Cubby in the park any more. We
mascots are all behind him,'' said McGruff, the crime-fighting dog.
   More than 1,600 fans have signed a petition asking that Cubby be
reinstated.

   Gizmo the ferret nuzzled shoulders and
crawled into a briefcase to make the point with a state senator that
he and his kind should not be classified as ``dangerous,
non-domesticated'' animals.
   Sen. Greg Dahl has proposed a bill that would require owners of
big cats, bears, venomous snakes and other creatures to buy permits
for their pets.
   Cheryl Jones brought Gizmo to the state Capitol on a powder-blue
leash Thursday to impress legislators with his docile demeanor.
   ``He can walk on a leash, but he can't heel,'' she said.
   A list of the potentially menacing animals prepared by the state
Department of Natural Resources included the ferret, but Dahl said
he had concluded even before Gizmo visited his office that the
ferrets were harmless.
   ``I had played with them before, and they didn't seem wild and
dangerous to me,'' Dahl said.
   Blair Joselyn, a Natural Resources supervisor, said owners of
other exotic pets likely would bring them around to protest the bill.
   ``I would expect you would see a few pit vipers in there,'' he
said, ``maybe a crocodile or two, a monkey, maybe a bear.''

   The Discovery astronauts packed up
their gear Friday, checked their experiments one last time and
prepared the space shuttle for a fiery dash through the Earth's
atmosphere and a dawn landing Saturday on a California desert.
   Crew members, said to be ``excellent spirits'' throughout the
mission, also took more photographs of the Earth and gave an
interview from space on the last full day of their flight.
   The astronauts were to awake early Saturday to get ready for the
hourlong plunge through the atmosphere and a powerless glide halfway
around the world. Landing is scheduled at 6:35 a.m. PST at Edwards
Air Force Base, Calif.
   ``We're looking for a good, clean landing tomorrow,'' flight
director Lee Briscoe said, adding that the forecast calls for
scattered clouds and light winds.
   ``This one (flight) probably ranks as one of the more
trouble-free,'' Briscoe said.
   Discovery commander Michael L. Coats and pilot John E. Blaha
checked several shuttle systems 180 miles above the Earth on Friday,
making sure the computers and control jets were ready for the trip
home.
   Unlike most previous flights, Discovery's re-entry will not go
through the eerie radio blackout that has occurred when a shuttle is
descending through the atmosphere.
   The blackout, which used to last about 15 minutes, occurs when a
spacecraft generates heat during its re-entry, ionizing atoms that
form a layer of electrically charged gas around the shuttle. The
layer blocks radio transmissions between the orbiter and the ground.
   But with the help of a $100 million communications satellite
deployed during the first post-Challenger flight last fall, Briscoe
said, ground controllers' contact with the shuttle should be
interrupted only about three minutes.
   Instead of trying to send radio messages straight to the ground,
the shuttle can send them to the satellite more than 20,000 miles
above Earth, which relays them to the ground.
   The satellite was first used in December during a classified
Defense Department mission by shuttle Atlantis, the second mission
since the Challenger disaster. It had a blackout of only about three
minutes, Briscoe said.
   Although controllers don't plan to communicate with Discovery
during the traditional blackout time, the ability is there in case a
problem occurs or if they wants the orbiter to land on a different
runway at Edwards, he said.
   If winds Saturday morning are 14-17 mph, Mission Control would
like Discovery to land on the dry lakebed to determine how the
shuttle handles under higher winds. But if the winds aren't strong
enough, the shuttle will land on a concrete runway to test its new
brake system, Briscoe said. The forecast makes the runway landing
more likely, he said.
   A final decision will be made about an hour before Coats and
Blaha fire two powerful rockets on the back of the shuttle to slow
the spacecraft and allow it to drop into the Earth's atmosphere.
   The other crew members are James F. Buchli, Robert C. Springer
and Dr. James M. Bagian, a physician.
   Discovery, the first of seven shuttle missions planned this year,
rocketed into orbit Monday after being delayed for about two hours
because of the weather. The flight is the third since the Challenger
explosion killed its seven astronauts more than three years ago.
   Several hours after blastoff, the crew completed its primary
mission _ deployment of a $100 million communications satellite that
completes a network NASA can use to communicate with shuttles and
other satellites nearly all the time.
   On Tuesday, the crew had to turn off unnecessary lights and
computers because of concern about erratic pressure readings from a
hydrogen tank that helps provide electricity to the orbiter. But the
shuttle was back on full power the next day after engineers
corrected the problem.
   Among the scientific experiments on board Discovery are four rats
and 32 fertilized chicken eggs _ two projects designed by students.
   The end of the mission also will be the end for the four rats,
which will be killed shortly after touchdown so researchers can
determine how their intentionally cut legs healed in space.
   But the eggs, housed in an incubator on the shuttle, will be
allowed to hatch to see if embryos can develop normally in space.
   Discovery's astronauts will return with nearly three miles of
film shot with a 70mm IMAX camera. The crew captured views of
pollution patterns in the oceans, floods in Africa, burned areas of
the Florida Everglades and western United States, and erupting
volcanoes in South America and Southeast Asia.
   During an interview Friday morning on the ``Today'' show on NBC,
Buchli said the scale and scope of air pollution ``is much more
dramatic'' as seen from orbit.
   ``What we're trying to do is get some evidence and documentation
to bring back and show people just how much we are dumping into the
atmosphere and perhaps get a feel how that might affect us in future
generations,'' he said.
   The IMAX film will be edited to create a study of the
environmental wounds man has inflicted on the Earth.
   Other experiments on Discovery include a group of plants grown in
space to test the effects of weightlessness on root growth; a
protein crystal growth study using 19 different proteins; and a
device called the heat pipe, which is a type of cooling system being
tested for use on the space station.

   A 22-year-old man sentenced to be
executed for killing a Las Vegas store clerk wants no stay of his
scheduled March 31 execution, a prison official says.
   David Pellegrini has been getting visits from relatives trying to
talk him into filing for a stay but he hasn't wavered in his
decision not to appeal, said Nevada State Prison Warden Harol
Whitley.
   ``We're going ahead with our preparations,'' said Whitley.
   However, he also said a court representative will be on hand as
the execution nears ``in case he changes his mind at the last
minute.''
   The warden said he doesn't know why Pellegrini wants no stay. He
also said the convict has said he won't allow any interviews unless
he is paid $500.
   Pellegrini had appealed to the state Supreme Court, but last
November the high court said the record provided substantial support
for the verdict and the penalty in the case.
   Pellegrini was sentenced to death for the October 1986 slaying of
Barry Hancock, 27, a convenience store clerk who was handcuffed and
shot in the head during a robbery.
   If Pellegrini is executed on schedule March 31, he would be the
107th person to be executed in this country since the U.S. Supreme
Court reviewed the death penalty in 1976. Two men have been executed
in Nevada since then. Ted Bundy was the last person to be executed
in the country, in Florida on Jan. 24.

   The State Department accused a Soviet official
on Friday of attempting to ``rewrite history'' with charges that the
United States and Pakistan are prolonging the war in Afghanistan.
   ``There is no doubt in anyone's mind about the origin of the
current conflict and the difficulties in Afghanistan today. ... The
Soviets occupied and invaded Afghanistan,'' said spokesman Charles
E. Redman.
   ``He's trying to rewrite history,'' Redman said of comments made
in Kabul by the Soviet ambassador, Yuli Vorontsov.
   Vorontsov called the United States ``tremendously immoral'' for
continuing to supply arms to the Afghan rebels, who are opposing the
Soviet-backed government of Afghan leader Najib.
   The Soviet official also charged that the United States and
Pakistan were risking a wider war in the region because of their
support for the Afghan guerrilla attack on the city of Jalalabad.
   The guerrillas have moved on Jalalabad, located some 85 miles
east of Kabul, in the hopes of advancing on the capital city.
   Although the Soviets completed the withdrawal of their troops in
mid-February, a major new Soviet arms airlift began last week.
   Redman asserted that new shipments of heavy artillery rockets
have been made and that they are being used to ``terrorize the
Afghan people.''
   Redman also accused the Soviet ambassador of attempting to
intimidate Pakistan with his comments. He said, ``The Soviets should
know that Pakistan has our full support in this situation.''
   The spokesman said he could not quantify U.S. support for the
rebels.
   ``Our position has always been that our support for the
resistance, the Mujahedeen, was firm, and that we would do what was
necessary. And I'd just leave it at that,'' Redman said.

<DATELINE>GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>

   Two paramedics were fired after they
slept through three emergency calls for a heart attack victim who
died en route to the hospital, a hospital official said.
   ``We have determined that human error was at fault,'' Pat Gouldy,
vice president of the Dallas-Fort Worth Medical Center, told the
Grand Prairie Emergency Services Advisory Board on Thursday night.
``We assume he (the ambulance driver) took the calls and fell back
asleep.''
   Gouldy said Clarence Cowden, 77, was dead when he arrived at the
hospital about an hour after his wife first called a 911 dispatcher.
   Ms. Gouldy said a chronology of the Feb. 8 incident was received
during an investigation. Both paramedics, who were not identified,
were fired later, Ms. Gouldy said.
   Cowden's two children listened as the report was read. His son,
Marvin, said the family was not seeking to punish anyone, but,
``Something has got to be done to make sure these people are on the
ball.''
   Since the incident, Ms. Gouldy said, the ambulance service has
installed loud alarm bells in each station and has ordered pagers to
be issued to crew members.
   ``The alarm bell rings when the phone rings,'' she said. ``All
unit pagers will have a coded tone to sound when the particular
station is being called.''
   Ms. Gouldy said a 911 dispatcher received a call from Cowden's
wife, Thelma, at 3:14 a.m. The dispatcher called the ambulance crew
at a substation 1{ miles from Cowden's home.
   The driver received the call at 3:15 a.m. in one of two bedrooms
at the station, Ms. Gouldy said. The other crew member did not have
a telephone in his room, she said.
   The dispatcher made two more calls when the crew did not announce
its departure on the radio. Both times a crew member answered the
telephone, but the ambulance did not move, Ms. Gouldy said.
   At 3:30 a.m., Ms. Gouldy said, an ambulance from another station
was dispatched. It arrived at the Cowden home at 3:35 a.m., 21
minutes after the first call, she said.

<HEAD>Hungarian Sisters Breaking Male Domination Of Chess</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID GOODMAN</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A brilliant trio of Hungarian chess playing
sisters led by Judit Polgar, the highest ranked 12-year-old player
in history, are poised to break into the highest levels of a game
dominated by male grandmasters.
   In November, Judit became the youngest player to recieve the
title of international master, an award gained by Bobby Fischer and
the current world champion, Garri Kasparov, when they were 14.
   Last month, 14-year-old Zsofi Polgar, rocked the chess world with
a startling victory in an international open tournament in Rome.
   Zsofi, previously considered the weakest player of the three,
amassed a remarkable eight victories and one draw against a field of
top Soviet and Western grandmasters.
   ``The Polgars represent the spirit of Mozart in chess. They have
a pure talent which I once thought, very incorrectly, was reserved
only for male players,'' said Larry Parr, the former editor of Chess
Life who now edits the New York-based magazine Glasnost.
   ``What does all this mean? Garri Kasparov may soon find out,''
Parr said.
   On Sunday, Judit, Zsofi and Szusza, 19, will begin play in the
New York Open, considered by experts as North America's most
prestigious annual competition.
   In the tournament, scheduled to end March 28 at the Penta Hotel
facing Madison Square Garden, the top section includes more than 40
grandmasters facing off for the $18,000 first prize. With additional
contests for amateurs, the $165,000 event is expected to attract
1,000 players.
   It was at last year's competition that Judit achieved her first
international master result. Since then, a series of stunning
victories has made her the 54th ranked player in the world.
   ``The only player who ever improved so fast in just a year was
Bobby Fischer, between the age of 14 and 15,'' said Jose Cuchi, the
tournament's organizer.
   The rise of the Polgars is the result of a remarkable experiment
instituted by their parents, Laszlo asnd Klara, who fought pressure
from East bloc officials and gained the right to educate their
children at home.
   The Polgars say children are capable of learning far more than
conventional educational methods will allow. They believe that for
the best possible results, specialization should begin early.
   From the age of five, each sister has been immersed in the study
of languages. When Szusza, who achieved her first grandmaster
performance last summer, chose chess over mathematics, her sisters
followed suit.
   Chess has already taken the family to more than 20 countries.
Should the girls realize their potential, they are likely to make
millions.
   The girls retain a keen interest in pop stars such as Michael
Jackson and Dianna Ross and enjoy table tennis. In jeans and
sneakers, they look like any teen-agers.
   ``I used to see Judit running around just like any other kids,
but when she plays chess, she could be a 50-year-old grandmaster,''
Cuchi said.
   In Rome, Zsofi was the only one who competed, cheered on on by
her sisters who enjoyed a non-playing holiday.
   ``After 14 tournaments in 1988, it was time for a rest,'' said
Judit.
   No woman has yet competed successfully against leading male
grandmasters. Men and women play for separate world titles and have
segregated ranking lists.
   Laszlo Polgar believes such artificial divisions hold women back.
The family generally shuns women-only competitions, but broke ranks
once to lead the Hungarian women's team to victory over the Soviets
in last year's chess Olympiad in Salonica, Greece.
   ``They are a tremendous inspiration,'' said Innsa Izrailov, a
member of the American womens chess team. ``Not just in chess, but
in all other areas where women are competing intellectually with
men.''

   A court on Friday convicted and sentenced a team of
hijackers who kidnapped a busload of schoolchildren in the Soviet
Union and traded them for drugs, money and a flight to Israel, Tass
said.
   The Supreme Court of the Russian republic found four hijackers
guilty of banditry and illegally crossing the Soviet border. It
sentenced the ringleader, Pavel Yakshiyants, to 15 years
imprisonment and three others to 14 years each.
   Tass said one of the three, Vladimir Muravlev, ``flew into
hysterics'' when the sentence was read out. ``It took a 10-minute
break to restore him to a state of relative calm.''
   According to Tass, a fifth defendant, Tofy Dzhafarov, did not
take part in the hijacking but was found guilty of being an
accomplice and was given a three-year sentence.
   The four hijackers commandeered a bus holding 30 fourth-graders
and their teacher as it left a field trip to a printing plant in the
Caucasus city of Ordzhonikidze on Dec. 1. They traded the children
and teacher for drugs, a large amount of foreign currency and
finally for an Ilyushin 76 transport plane and safe passage to
Israel on Dec. 2.
   Israel allowed the plane to land but deported the hijackers the
next day.
   The incident led to close cooperation between Israel and the
Soviet Union, which have had no diplomatic relations since the
Soviets broke them following the 1967 Middle East war.
   Soviet officials have said most of the hijackers had criminal
records and that the hijacking was not motivated by their politics.

<HEAD>Fixed, Adjustable-Rate Mortgages Up This Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fixed-rate home mortgages currently are
averaging 10.98 percent, their highest level since October 1987, and
adjustable-rate mortgages are at their highest point in more than
three years, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. reported Friday.
   According to Freddie Mac's weekly national survey, this week's
average for fixed-rate mortgages was up from 10.86 percent last week
to the highest level since rates averaged 11.36 percent in the week
ending Oct. 23, 1987.
   On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, meanwhile, lenders were
asking an average initial rate of 9.02 percent this week, the
highest since they hit 9.09 percent on Jan. 17, 1986. The ARM rate
was up from 8.93 percent last week.
   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been nudging up interest
rates in an effort to restrain economic growth and thus keep
inflation in check.
   Housing construction hit a post-recession peak in 1986 and has
been sliding since then, although most economists say the industry
remains healthy as it weathers a controlled slowdown.
   Analysts are forecasting a further decline in the housing market
this year as the higher interest rates start to pinch and the
economy begins to cool down.
   Housing construction was down 11.4 percent in February, the
government reported on Thursday, with analysts attributing the
decline in part to an expected fallback after a warm-weather surge
in January but also to the bite of rising interest rates.
   ``We're looking for a modest decline of housing market activity,
due not only to somewhat higher mortgage rates but also due to the
fact that the economy is slowing,'' said economist Richard Peach of
the Mortgage Bankers Association.
   Peach said the effects of higher interest rates on the housing
market so far have been minor, but are likely to increase in future
months.
   Economist Michael Sumichrast, who publishes a newsletter on the
housing industry, maintained the Fed's tight money policy already
was having a negative impact on construction and sales.
   ``There has been an outcry of frustration about the Federal
Reserve Board tightening up,'' he said. ``We are going to get into a
recession on housing unless the Fed eases up.''
   The rise in adjustable-rate mortgages is particularly troubling,
since many homebuyers have relied on the lower initial rates offered
with ARMs to break into the housing market, Sumichrast said.

<HEAD>Judge Restrains Timber Sales In Northwest Environmental Battle</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge said Friday he would issue a
temporary order to delay 135 timber sales planned by the U.S. Forest
Service because of the battle over protecting old growth trees and a
rare owl, an attorney said.
   The order affects about 1 billion board feet of timber or about
one-fifth of the Forest Service's total annual timber sales in the
Northwest, said John Lowe, deputy regional forester for the U.S.
Forest Service in Portland, Ore.
   Todd True, an attorney with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund,
said U.S. District Judge William Dwyer told him by phone that the
order would be in effect until Thursday when environmental groups
will again seek an injunction to stop sales of old-growth.
   The issue pits environmentalists trying to preserve sections of
virgin forest and the spotted owl, which nests only in dense
old-growth forest, against loggers who say their jobs are at stake.
   Earlier this week, Dwyer denied a request by nine environmental
groups for an injunction to stop Forest Service sales of old-growth
timber.
   But True said the judge ``invited us to address particular sales
and that's what we are doing here. Our concerns are the same as they
have always been with the preservation of the ecosystem and the
owl.''
   ``We have filed this case to protect the old-growth forest and
the spotted owl, one of the inhabitants of that forest, which faces
an imminent risk of extinction,'' True said.
   ``The basis of seeking an injunction against these sales is to
protect 18,000 acres of owl habitat in the next 60 days,'' said True.
   True said 53 sales in the next 60 days are not covered by the
order. He said those sales covered small parcels of forests but he
did not know the acreage affected.
   The assistant manager of the Washington Contract Loggers
Association said he was not surprised by the action.
   Bill Pickell said it's ``just another ploy by the preservationist
to put a stop to the industry.''
   Pickell said he believes the industry will prevail because the
spotted owl is not in danger of extinction.
   ``I think we've got all the facts. They've got the emotion,''
said Pickell.
   True said the Forest Service has ``hundreds of thousands of acres
of Forest Service land that is not owl habitat.''

<HEAD>Bush Says He's Had a `Pulse Change' on Gun Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Friday he's had a ``pulse
change'' in his views on gun control that was reflected in the
administration's decision this week to ban the importation of most
semiautomatic weapons.
   Bush, speaking with reporters on Air Force One as he flew here
from Colorado, said that the national debate over assault weapons
like the AK-47 had gotten ``a little bit' too hot.
   ``We'll make our decisions in a cool way. ... We won't be swayed
by the temper of the debate,'' he said.
   Bush said that the decision to limit imports of five models of
semiautomatic weapons ``represents a heightened concern on my part
about AK-47s'' but that he is not prepared at this point to move
beyond that action.
   ``We have to find an accommodation between the police and the
sporting interests,'' Bush said.
   Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms said the government may ban imports of additional kinds of
semiautomatic weapons.
   The bureau is still reviewing the uses of all types of imported
semiautomatics but has not reached a decision on whether to suspend
importation of more models than the five types banned from import
this week, said Jerry Rudden, a spokesman for the agency.
   ``The process is ongoing. Additional firearms may very well be
added to the list. ... Large numbers of firearms are being looked
at,'' he said.
   National Rifle Association lobbyist Wayne LaPierre met with
Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, on Thursday. But an aide to
Sununu said LaPierre did not push to block an expansion of the ban
to more weapons models.
   Asked if the import ban _ which does not affect sale of U.S.-made
weapons _ was a change of position on gun control, Bush held his
hand up to his wrist and said: ``It's a pulse change.''
   He voiced support for the decision this week of a U.S. firearms
manufacturer, Colt, to impose voluntary restraints on its production
of semiautomatic weapons.
   ``I'm certainly not going to differ with that decision,'' he said.
   Bush said he could understand the emotionally charged nature of
the debate on guns. ``I can understand when kids are shot down by
semiautomatic weapons, I can certainly understand the public
outcry.''
   When asked whether he was looking at further steps, Bush said:
``Well, we'll let you know.''
   Bush also said:
   _That ``no decision has been made'' on a proposed joint venture
with the Japanese for production in Japan of a new version of the
F-16 jet fighter. He sought to play down earlier suggestions that a
basic commitment had been made to the project, with only details
remaining to be worked out.
   _He was saddened that hostage Terry Anderson, chief Middle East
correspondent for The Associated Press, was beginning his fifth year
of captivity in Lebanon, but said that wouldn't lead to any change
or reformulation in U.S. policy on hostages. The fact that Anderson
and others remain held against their will ``is with me every single
waking hour,'' Bush said.

   The Nigerian ambassador to the United States is
planning a trip here next week to try to ease what local Nigerians
say is a growing atmosphere of prejudice and persecution.
   Emeka Ozurumba, a Houston attorney and head of the Nigerian
Foundation, an organization of about 1,000 Nigerians in the city,
said Thursday the January shooting death of a Nigerian by police and
a television news report linking Nigerians to credit card scams is
fueling outrage in the community.
   ``The prejudice is everywhere,'' he said. ``The Nigerian
community has decided enough is enough, and they don't want to take
it anymore. They just want to live peacefully.''
   Nigerian Ambassador Hamzat Ahmadu will meet Monday and Tuesday
with city officials, Ozurumba said.
   Ozurumba does not dispute some Nigerians are criminals, but
insists they represent only a few of the 5,000 Nigerians living in
Houston.
   ``I do not pretend that all Nigerians are angels,'' he said. ``It
doesn't give anyone the right to generalize that all Nigerians are
criminals.''
   In January, Martin Nana, 33, was killed by police who were
summoned to his apartment by a security guard who said the man
refused to turn down loud music. Police who responded said the
Nigerian was shot after he lunged at an officer.

   More than 1.5 million Fisher-Price car safety
seats for children are being recalled by the manufacturer because
they do not meet federal flammability standards, the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration said Friday.
   The agency said it had received no complaints of fires or fire
injuries from the seats, which are Models 9100 and 9101 manufactured
from 1985 to 1989.
   The company's own tests discovered that the foam seat pad used in
the two models burns faster than federal standards permit, NHTSA
said.
   Since the pad cover does meet standards, motorists should
continue to use the seats until they get replacement pads, and
should not return them to stores, the agency said.
   Fisher-Price will notify owners who returned warranty cards and
will mail displays on the recall to pediatricians.
   Owners of the affected seats may call a Fisher-Price hotline,
800-334-5439, for instructions.

<HEAD>Sociologist Says 1989 Crucial Year For Soviet Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A leading Soviet sociologist on Friday said 1989 is
a critical year for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms because
empty store shelves have damaged people's faith that things will
change.
   ``1989 will be a crucial year for perestroika,'' said Tatyana
Zaslavskaya. ``It is necessary to begin implementing promises.
Expectations are high.''
   Ms. Zaslavskaya is a leading theorist of reform efforts and heads
the Soviet Public Opinion Center. Her comments at a news conference
came a day after the Communist Party Central Committee approved a
farm reform to counter urgent food shortages.
   Gorbachev embarked on his reform program upon taking power in
1985, and Ms. Zaslavskaya said enthusiasm for the program reached a
peak in 1987. However, since then ``we are witnessing a
deterioration. The most important factor is the supply in the
shops,'' she said.
   Intellectuals still strongly support the reform effort because it
has provided a freer atmosphere for public discussion, art and
literature. But workers are more interested in their standard of
living, and polling data indicates most believe they are worse off,
she said.
   Gorbachev's measures include a major drive to make state-run
enterprises pay their own way rather than count on state subsidies.
Some experts say subsidies discourage producers from manufacturing
the cheap consumer goods that are in high demand.
   ``The Soviet people, the Russian people, have a lot of patience,
but some results are needed,'' Ms. Zaslavskaya said. ``The worst
thing is when the people become indifferent. Without the people, you
cannot go ahead.''
   Ms. Zaslavskaya said to heal its stagnating economy the Soviet
Union must enact broad price reforms, including eliminating many
heavy subsidies on retail prices. But any such changes must wait two
or three years, she said.
   ``If there is a price reform now it will harm perestroika
(Gorbachev's economic restructuring plan),'' Ms. Zaslavskaya said.
``In present conditions it would create a social uproar,'' she said.
   Some workers also are concerned about reforms that tie wages to
productivity, Ms. Zaslavskaya said.
   ``A considerable number of people working at factories and plants
for an average wage produce shoddy goods at a leisurely pace,'' she
said.
   The Soviet Central Committee on Thursday adopted an agriculture
program it says will improve food supplies by the mid-1990s.
   The program depends largely on giving farmers the right to take
long-term leases on state-run land and decide what to plant.
   Gorbachev sharply criticized the Soviet farm system and told the
Central Committee that the inability of state and collective farms
to feed the country was leading to social discontent.

<HEAD>Nader Denounces Proposed Pay Raise for Judges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer advocate Ralph Nader on Friday
denounced a proposed 30 percent pay raise for federal judges and
criticized Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist for leading the drive
for higher pay.
   Rehnquist's warning that the current pay levels are a serious
threat to the judiciary is ``among the most exaggerated remarks ever
uttered by a chief justice,'' Nader said.
   He said few judges are leaving the bench and current pay is no
barrier to attracting talented law school professors and the vast
majority of lawyers who make less than federal judges.
   Less than 1 percent of federal judges have resigned since 1974
because of the pay or any other reason, Nader added.
   ``That's too low an attrition rate given the number of judges who
are indolent or less than competent,'' he said. `You would want a
higher attrition rate actually.''
   Rehnquist made a highly unusual personal appeal Wednesday for a
pay hike, calling the current situation ``the most serious threat to
the future of the judiciary and its continued operations that I have
observed.''
   Court personnel said the only other instances in which justices
have held news conferences in the Supreme Court building were to
announce their retirement.
   Nader said Rehnquist has lent his prestige to ``a pretty mundane
lobbying effort'' unsupported by evidence.
   ``The chief justice has a right to speak out,'' Nader said. ``But
he is not being held to a standard'' of proof that supports hardship
claims.
   Rehnquist proposed increasing annual salaries for federal trial
judges from $89,500 to $116,350, and from $95,000 to $123,000 for
appeals court judges. The plan would hike the chief justice's yearly
pay from $115,000 to $149,500 and raise the salary of other high
court justices from $110,000 to $143,000.
   Congress on Feb. 7 rejected a 51 percent pay hike for itself,
federal judges and high-ranking government officials.
   Nader said Rehnquist's remark that federal judges require higher
pay ``so they'll be able to educate their kids'' is ``the essence of
elitism.''
   Nader said if Rehnquist is correct then President Bush ``should
declare a national economic emergency'' for all parents whose pay is
less than $90,000 a year.
   Nader also disputed Rehnquist's assertion that judicial salaries
are not keeping pace with inflation.
   More than half the federal judges were appointed since 1979 and
their pay raises since then exceed the inflation rate, Nader said.
   He also said the anger of judges who see young lawyers being paid
more than them is misdirected.
   ``Why are these young lawyers paid so much?'' Nader said.
``Because of billing abuses by the big corporate law firms'' that
employ them.

   The two largest actors unions have reached a
tentative contract settlement with television and film producers,
officials said Friday.
   Mark Locher, a spokesman for the 70,000-member Screen Actors
Guild, said negotiators for SAG and the 68,000-member American
Federation of Television and Radio Artists ``were polishing the
final contract language.''
   A spokesman for the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television
Producers, Herb Steinberg, confirmed a deal had been reached
Thursday.
   According to a report in the trade newspaper Daily Variety, the
actors have agreed to accept new rules governing overtime work and
reruns for one-hour television shows in exchange for increased
salaries and health and pension benefits.
   The unions' two boards are to examine the package Monday night.
If approved for ratification, the unions' membership will vote on it
in coming weeks.
   The current pact does not expire until the end of June.
   Hollywood was crippled last year by a five-month strike by the
Writers Guild of America. The talks with the actors unions had been
expected to be more difficult.

   The navy on Friday said five Japanese
fishing boats held by Chilean authorities were ``detained for safety
inspection'' and not seized in retaliation for a ban on Chilean
fruit imports.
   ``No foreign boats, including those from Japan, are currently
seized in Chile or prevented from operating normally,'' the Foreign

   But in Talcahuano, a Japanese trawler was ``detained on orders
from the from the commander-in-chief's office,'' according to a
naval officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The discovery during the weekend of two grapes tainted with
cyanide in Philadelphia's port kicked off a public health scare.
   Japan imposed a ban on fruit imports from this South American
nation.
   The United States issued a four-day consumer alert but announced
Friday that it would lift a warning against Chilean produce.
   The Chilean Foreign Ministry statement was an apparent move away
from statements Thursday by navy commander Adm. Jose Merino that the
ships were ``seized'' until Japan lifted its ban.
   ``The boats are retained and being subject to a mandatory
thorough inspection,`` navy Lt. Jose Araya said in a telephone
interview. ``This is necessary for the safety of all people on board
those vessels. Once inspectors are satisfied with the safety
standards of the boats, they will let them sail off.''
   President Bush told reporters on Friday that Chilean produce
would be subject to increased inspection but would be allowed back
on U.S. markets.
   The decision was announced despite a third poisoning threat
received by the U.S. Embassy in Chile. Earlier calls to the U.S. and
Japanese embassies in Santiago prompted U.S. officials to conduct
the spot checks.
   At the White House, Chile's foreign minister, Felipe Hernan
Errazuriz, called the decision ``a workable solution.''
   ``It takes into account the interest of the U.S. citizens and the
Chileans, the consumers and the workers from Chile and everyone,''
Errazuriz said.
   The foreign minister Thursday had said at least 200,000 fruit
industry workers would be left ``without jobs and almost destitute''
if the U.S. government maintained the consumer warnings.
   Fruit accounts for 10 percent of all Chilean exports, and 65
percent of the nation's produce is sent to the United States, the
government said.

<HEAD>Honeybee Quarantine Imposed to Combat Mite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agriculture Department is imposing a
far-ranging federal quarantine, affecting 19 states and other areas,
to help stop the spread of tiny parasitic mites that threaten the
honeybee industry.
   Officials said the proposed quarantine would also be effective in
the District of Columbia and 15 U.S. territories or other
possessions known or believed to be infested with the Varroa mite.
   ``We are proposing to quarantine all `states' where Varroa mites
are known to occur,'' said Al Strating, acting administrator of the
department's Animal and Health Inspection Service.
   ``In addition, because honeybees have been shipped from infested
areas to commercial and hobbyist beekeepers throughout the United
States, we would preventively quarantine all states that have not
conducted Varroa mite detection surveys,'' he said. ``This action
would make possible the identification and containment of Varroa
mite infestations.''
   States listed in the proposal, which was announced on Thursday,
include: Alaska, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New
York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Wisconsin and
Wyoming.
   Other areas include: American Samoa, Baker Island, Guam, Howland
Island, Jarvis Island, Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef, Midway Islands,
Navassa Island, Northern Mariana Islands, Palmyra Atoll, Puerto
Rico, Republic of Palau, U.S. Virgin Islands and Wake Island.
   Strating said the regulations would restrict the interstate
movement of honeybees and bee equipment from quarantined areas. Such
articles would have to undergo inspection and-or treatement before
being allowed to move across state lines.
   Varroa mites were discovered in the United States in a Wisconsin
apiary in September 1987. A quarantine was imposed in April 1988 but
canceled after a month because it was too complex to administer.
   Meetings among federal and state authorities, beekeepers, crop
producers and researchers were held to develop the new proposed
rules.
   The Varroa mite is an external parasite of adult honeybees and
their developing larvae, or brood. Infestations cause decreased
brood numbers, deformed bees and weaken the bees' ability to
pollinate plants and produce honey.
   Honeybees are used to pollinate a number of crops valued by USDA
at up to $20 billion annually, besides their value as honey
producers.
   The proposal will be open for public comment until March 31,
Strating said. Comments on the proposal, docket no. 89-002, may be
sent in triplicate to Helene R. Wright, Chief, Regulatory Analysis
and Development, PPD, APHIS, USDA, Room 866, Federal Building, 6505
Belcrest Road, Hyattsville, Md., 20782.

   A U.S. Marine helicopter crashed Friday
in a rice paddy during joint exercises with South Korean forces and
killed all four crewmen aboard, the U.S. military said.
   The CH-46 helicopter went down near Toksok-Ri on the east coast
while taking part in annual ``Team Spirit'' exercises, a U.S.
military statement said. No one was reported injured on the ground.
   The statement said the cause of the crash was unknown.
   In Washington, the Marine Corps identified the dead as Capt.
Lawrence L. Beason Jr., 28, of Plano, Texas; 1st Lt. Christopher M.
O'Connor, 26, of Gaylord, Mich.; Cpl. Michael W. Vinet, 22, of
Riverside, Calif., and Lance Cpl. Jon D. Edwards, 19, of Poway,
Calif.
   The helicopter was assigned to the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit
based at Camp Pendleton, Calif., the statement said. The
troop-transport helicopter had been operating from the Marine
assault ship the U.S.S. Belleau Wood.
   About 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops are taking part in the
maneuvers to practice bringing in U.S. reinforcements in the event
of an attack by communist North Korea.
   The United States has about 42,000 troops based in South Korea
under a mutual defense treaty.

<HEAD>Guidance Counselors Focus on Teen Suicide</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As 5,000 high school guidance counselors and mental
health workers convene in Boston this week, many are talking about a
problem that isn't going away: teen suicide.
   ``I saw five suicidal kids in a two-week period,'' said Rhonda
Chambers, a Baton Rouge, La., guidance counselor. ``Sometimes I just
tell them I love them.''
   Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Americans ages 11
to 24, said David Capuzzi, a specialist in suicide prevention at
Portland State University in Oregon. A young person attempts suicide
every 90 seconds, and one in 60 succeeds, he said.
   Capuzzi's lecture, which attracted more than 80 people, was one
of six on teen suicide in a four-day conference of the American
Association for Counseling and Development.
   Susan Virenius, a middle school counselor from St. Louis, Mich.,
told of the eighth-grader who recently shot himself in the shoulder
while babysitting another child. She considered it a suicide
warning, but said getting troubled adolescents help isn't always
easy.
   ``Counseling in my area is $75 an hour,'' Virenius said. ``So the
rich have accessibiity and the poor go without. The only way they
can get help is to get in trouble with the law.''
   Capuzzi said he has helped school districts in 23 states set up
suicide prevention programs, including one at a Montana school where
17 youngsters committed suicide in 11 months.
   ``They're doing better, but many are not even started,'' Capuzzi
said.
   He urges school districts to train all the adults _ not just
teachers and counselors _ to recognize signs of trouble, since
students sometimes decide to confide in a sympathetic cafeteria
worker or bus driver. He also tells schools to make sure, before
they broach the subject with students, that help is immediately
available for those who come forward.
   ``Adolescents, once they make up their mind, usually act within
24 to 72 hours, so you can't wait,'' he said.
   He also advised schools not to use materials that show actual
suicide attempts or methods.
   ``Doing a presentation won't precipitate suicide in someone who
isn't suicidal, but if you have a suicidal adolescent in a group and
don't know it and show them how to do it, that may be all they
need,'' he said.
   Guidance counselors said signs that a teen-agers may be
contemplating suicide are commonplace, and can range from depression
and sudden behavioral changes to reckless driving, drinking bouts
and giving away prized possessions. Virenius said she recently has
seen youngsters carve their initials into their arms, cut themselves
or burn themselves with cigarettes.
   Drugs and alcohol, confusion over sexual identity, and above all
family problems are the most common causes of trouble, counselors
said.
   ``You can say `I love you,' but if you can't communicate it in a
way that it means something to me, it doesn't help,'' Virenius said.

   An armed group of five to eight
people attacked a guard post at an army artillery unit on the
outskirts of the capital and fled when sentinels returned their
fire, the army said Friday.
   The incident occurred shortly before midnight Thursday at the Air
Defense Artillery Group 101 in Ciudadela, 12 miles west of the
capital, the office of the chief of staff said in a brief communique.
   No one was killed or injured, and the attack, which ended when
the attackers fled in two or three vehicles, is under investigation,
the communique said.
   The incident was one of several that have occurred since the Jan.
23 attack by civilian commandos on La Tablada infantry base west of
the city. The government said the attackers were leftist extremists
and that 28 commandos and 11 troops were killed.
   Federal Judge Gerardo Larrambebere, who is investigating the La
Tablada attack, said there were no indications that the Thursday
night incident was related. ``Nevertheless, it is a hypothesis that
can't be discarded,'' he added.
   Twenty people who were arrested at La Tablada or shortly after
face charges of homicide and assault and are being held in
preventive detention pending trial.
   Gen. Francisco Gassino, the army chief of staff, told about 100
retired generals on Wednesday that there have been about 100 acts of
hostility against the armed forces since Jan. 23, the private news
agency Noticias Argentinas and the newspaper Clarin reported.
   Gassino ``even revealed that shots were fired against his
residence in Campo de Mayo (army base) when he was taking a few days
off last February,'' Clarin reported.

<HEAD>Some Subway Strikers Return But Refuse To Work</HEAD>

   Hundreds of striking subway employees
returned to their posts Friday after police said strike leaders
would be prosecuted, but many of the returning workers refused to do
anything, officials said.
   Also Friday, protesters stormed the headquarters of the governing
party and battled riot police at three colleges, demanding the
ouster of President Roh Tae-woo, authorities said.
   Protesters threw firebombs and rocks during the clashes and
police responded with tear gas. At least five students were reported
hurt.
   Partial service was restored on three of the city's four subway
lines after the return of about 3,300 workers who went on strike
Thursday. But many of the returned workers refused to work, instead
holding protest meetings or refusing to follow orders, subway
officials said.
   Returned workers said they would not resume normal work until
police released all arrested strikers and dropped charges against
strike leaders.
   About 15,000 riot police guarded subway stations to prevent
protests by strikers. Some stations were shut with steel gratings
locked over entrances and riot troopers stood guard.
   Hundreds of thousands of commuters who normally take the subway
struggled for a second day to get to work. About 10,000 extra buses
and army vehicles were mobilized by the government to help ferry the
3 million commuters who normally use the subway each day.
   Police on Friday released most of the 2,300 subway strikers
arrested Thursday when riot police stormed a subway depot.
   About 6,000 of the subway's 7,732 workers went on strike Thursday
to demand the resignation of the president of the city-owned system,
Kim Myong-nong even though agreement had been reached on a new pay
and working hours agreement.
   The college protests Friday broke out after about two dozen
students stormed the headquarters of the Democratic Justice Party
and briefly occupied the roof and hurled firebombs at police. The
protesters were overpowered and arrested by about 100 riot police.
   Clashes later broke out at Seoul National, Dongguk and Kon Kuk
universities, with police involved in running battles with students
who hurled firebombs and rocks and shouted anti-Roh slogans. About
1,500 students were involved in the clashes.
   Some opposition and dissident groups are making a joint effort to
defeat Roh in an upcoming national referendum. Radical students vow
to stage a wave of anti-Roh street demonstrations prior to the
plebiscite, expected in mid-April.
   Roh promised in a 1987 campaign to hold a referendum to let
people assess his performance. Government officials have said Roh
would stay in power even if he is defeated.
   A Cabinet minister who resigned this week said Friday that he
stepped down to help Roh win the referendum. Political analysts and
newspapers speculated Kim resigned to express dissatisfaction with
Roh for not having taken stronger steps against dissent.
   Kim Yong-gap, a conservative former army officer, quit his post
as administration minister after saying the government Tae-woo was
threatened by radicals and dissidents.
   ``I've resigned to make the nation aware of an expansion of
leftist forces,'' he said Friday. ``Democratization can be realized
only by a strong government, and the ruling party must maintain
stability by reorganizing the political setup after the appraisal,''
he said, referring to the referendum.
   He was replaced Thursday by Kim Yong-rae, Seoul mayor during
September's Olympic Games and a bureaucrat who served under the
authoritarian government of former President Chun Doo-hwan.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity said Friday that draft
legislation the government sent to parliament violates commitments
made to the opposition in negotiations on political and economic
reform.
   The outlawed independent union called it a ``serious crisis'' in
the talks, which began Feb. 6. The government said it sent the bills
to the Sejm, or parliament, only so discussion by the deputies could
begin.
   ``We have to express deep fear and concern,'' Solidarity national
spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz told a news conference.
   Government and opposition delegates to the ``round table'' talks
agreed to hold the first fully democratic elections in the communist
bloc for a new Senate and to open up 35 percent of the Sejm to the
independent opposition, whose candidates would participate in
elections.
   They also agreed that Solidarity and other banned groups would be
made legal again and a strong presidency would be created,
presumably to be filled by Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the Communist
Party chief.
   ``After all these debates, we thought that we had reached an
agreement on certain things that are not reflected in the draft sent
to the Sejm,'' Onyszkiewicz said, but the draft legislation ``puts
all of the decisions of the round table under a question mark.''
   ``The talks at the round table find themselves in a serious
crisis,'' he said. ``We want to express our anxiety over how the
talks will end. At the moment, the impasse is very deep.''
   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said Friday night he was
``surprised at this dramatizing of the situation.''
   ``Perhaps nerves fail my colleague or perhaps it is negotiating
tactics,'' he said in a statement carried by the official news
agency PAP.
   Urban said the laws were sent to the parliament so deputies
``could discuss them at the same time as the debate at the round
table. Nothing is prejudged, either at the round table or at the
Sejm.''
   Onyszkiewicz would not go into detail about problems with the
draft legislation, but noted that it went to the Sejm before
specifics of the law creating the Senate and presidency were
discussed in the talks.
   He also said the draft lacked an agreed-upon provision that each
candidate in parliamentary elections, to ensure fairness, would have
the right to a representative on the vote-counting commission.
   ``If the authorities go ahead with the draft law on electoral
procedure, the Senate and the presidency, the entire contract may be
broken,'' he said.
   The government said Friday the parliament would meet next week
for the first reading of constitutional amendments creating the
presidency and Senate, election procedures for the Sejm and Senate,
a law on forming associations another on trade unions and trade
unions for farmers.
   All the laws have been discussed in the negotiations, which are
supposed end working sessions Tuesday in hopes of a final plenary
session and signing of a ``social contract'' April 3.

   Here is the text of the declaration
approved Thursday by the foreign ministers of the Organization of
Islamic Conference on the book ``The Satanic Verses'' by British
novelist Salman Rushdie. The English translation was distributed by
the conference.
   The conference issued a declaration on joint Islamic action to
combat blasphemy against Islam in which it expressed the resolve of
all Islamic states to coordinate their efforts, based on the shari'a
(Koranic law), to effectively combat blasphemy against Islam and
abuse of Islamic personalities. The conference declared that all
Islamic countries should make more effective efforts to ensure
respect for Islam and its noble values.
   The conference declared that blasphemy could not be justified on
the basis of freedom of thought or expression. It strongly condemned
the blasphemous publication ``The Satanic Verses,'' whose author is
regarded as an apostate and appealed to all members of the
international community to ban the book and take necessary measures
to protect the religious beliefs of others.

<HEAD>Suspect Police Killer May Go Free Because Of Bad Search Warrant</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prosecutor says he has gathered overwhelming
evidence against an alleged police killer, right down to the piece
of chicken the suspect was eating before the shooting. But the trial
may never take place because detectives lied to obtain a search
warrant.
   On Monday, Suffolk Superior Court Judge Charles Grabau is
scheduled to hold a hearing to decide whether Albert Lewin, 33, will
be charged in the shooting of a Boston detective during a raid on a
drug dealer's apartment 13 months ago.
   The detective, 36-year-old Sherman Griffiths, was felled by a
bullet that pierced the apartment's steel-reinforced door as members
of Boston's elite anti-drug task force prepared to break it down.
   Grabau dismissed the original charges against Lewin two weeks ago
after detectives failed to produce a potential defense witness, the
informant who supposedly led them to the apartment where the
shooting took place.
   In a remarkable turnabout in their story, the three detectives,
under pressure from the prosecutor, filed affidavits Monday
admitting that the informant they called ``John'' never existed.
   Assistant District Attorney Francis O'Meara, in asking Grabau to
change his mind and reinstate the charges, said he will argue Monday
that the evidence against Lewin is so overwhelming that the
misconduct by police should not block the prosecution.
   By the time the officers finally got into the apartment, the
killer had fled down a back stairway. But the evidence that Lewin
had been in the apartment is strong, said O'Meara.
   ``I've got his fingerprints in there, I've got his clothes in the
closet, I've got his cigarettes, I've got his foot powder. I've even
got the piece of chicken that he was eating 20 minutes before the
raid,'' O'Meara said.
   Lewin's defense attorney, Max Stern, contends that the
detectives' misconduct has permanently prevented his client from
getting a fair trial.
   ``The critical witnesses, the police officers themselves, have
completely trumped themselves and the (prosecution's) case by their
massive and repeated perjury in the case, which they now admit to,''
Stern said. ``They have lied so many times now that there's no way
to put any faith in the reliability of anything they say.''
   According to the affidavit filed by the detectives to obtain a
search warrant, an informant named John told them that a 5-foot,
6-inch Hispanic drug dealer named Stevie was selling cocaine from
the apartment.
   From the beginning, a key hole in the prosecution's case has been
that Lewin, who is 6-foot-2 and Jamaican, clearly does not fit that
description. As a result, defense attorneys requested last year that
police produce John as a witness. But the detectives said they could
not find him.
   Under pressure from the district attorney's office, which is
investigating them for possible perjury, Detectives Carlos A. Luna,
Hugo R. Amate and Paul G. Schroeder filed affidavits this week
changing their story. Mark Sullivan, Luna's attorney, said the men
admitted that ``John'' was not a real person, but a composite of two
informants.
   Christopher Muse, attorney for Amate and Schroeder, says the
detectives decided to come forward, even though they may be
implicating themselves for perjury, because they ``want to see
justice done'' in the murder of their partner.
   Prosecutors say they now believe that the real informant was not
John, but someone else, and that ``Stevie'' was merely a stock
description of a typical Boston drug dealer.
   Even though his case may be blown apart by the detectives'
admission that they lied, O'Meara said he does not judge them
harshly.
   He said intense pressure from Boston's political leaders and
society as a whole to crack down on drug dealers ``forces good and
decent young police officers into the ethical dilemma: `Should I do
it right and not get it done? Or should I do it a little wrong, but
get it done?'''

<TEXT>
   Afghan warplanes bombed Moslem
guerrilla positions outside the strategic Afghan city of Jalalabad,
and the insurgents claimed Friday that government soldiers were
among those killed in the attacks.
   Guerrillas claim more than 100 people may have been killed in
latest fighting for Afghanistan's third largest city, where the
insurgents launched an offensive nearly two weeks ago. The claim
could not be independently confirmed.
   Radio stations controlled by two guerrilla groups based in
Pakistan said the bombardment Thursday night occurred north, east
and south of Jalalabad.
   The casualties included civilians and combatants on both sides,
said Quribar Rehman Saeed of the guerrilla-run Afghan News Agency.
   ``They were bombing so heavy they don't care about their own
soldiers,'' he said of the Afghan pilots.
   Saeed said Afghan soldiers died in the bombardment because the
opposing forces were fighting at close quarters. ``They are
face-to-face,'' he said.
   The Soviet news agency Tass on Thursday quoted military officials
in Kabul, the Afghan capital, as saying 4,500 guerrillas have died
and more than 2,000 have been wounded since the insurgents launched
their Jalalabad offensive March 6. Guerrilla spokesmen put their
losses at 200 dead and 700 wounded.
   The Afghan military has not released its casualty figures.
   The guerrillas reportedly captured Jalalabad's biggest garrison
and penetrated the airport perimeter before the fighting reached a
stalemate.
   The Jalalabad offensive is the first the guerrillas have launched
since the Soviets completed their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan
last month.
   The fall of Jalalabad, 80 miles east of Kabul and 40 miles from
the Pakistan border, would be a major blow to the Soviet-backed
Afghan government. The city is strategic because it is on the main
highway from Pakistan to Kabul.
   Soviet officials said they resumed airlifting arms and ammunition
to Kabul on Wednesday in response to the guerrilla offensive.
   Elsewhere in Afghanistan, the Afghan army claimed it killed 59
guerrillas, including two foreign military advisers, in fighting in
Herat and Kandahar provinces, the Soviet news agency Tass reported
today.
   The report, which did not say when the fighting occurred, said
the Afghan army only lost four men.
   Moscow and Kabul also accused Pakistan of sending hundreds of its
troops to help direct the onslaught by an estimated 14,000 Moslem
guerrillas. They also claimed Pakistani troops were mobilizing male
Afghan refugees, some just teen-agers, to join the fight.
   Pakistan's Foriegn Ministry called the claims ``fictitious.''
   Pakistan and the United States have been the insurgents' primary
military backers in their 11-year war to establish an Islamic
republic of Afghanistan.
   Afghanistan has complained repeatedly that Pakistan has thousands
of its military men backing up the guerrillas.
   Tass also quoted Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan Yuli Vorontsov
on Friday as saying Afghanistan's armed forces have shown since the
Soviet withdrawal that ``they are prepared and able to uphold by
themselves, without our military participation, the country's
sovereignty.''
   The State Department accused Moscow of seeking to rewrite history
after Vorontsov said Thursday that the United States is to blame for
the fighting and that U.S. support of the guerrillas is ``immoral.''
   Vorontsov's charges ``are not going to cause the world community
to forget that the Soviets occupied and invaded Afghanistan (in
1979) or the continuing Soviet effort to prop up the discredited
regime in Kabul,'' spokesman Charles Redman said in Washington.
   Also Friday, an Afghan guerrilla leader in Iran said the
resistance groups in Pakistan should give greater recognition to the
Shiite Moslem guerrillas in Iran, the official Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
   ``By ignoring the rights of Shiites, the Afghan Sunni groups have
harmed the Islamic revolution in Afghanistan,'' Sheikh Asef Mohseni
Qandahari, head of the Islamic Movement of Afghanistan, was quoted
as saying.
   On Thursday, the 46-member Organization of Islamic Conference
voted to recognize the interim government formed in Pakistan. The
Iranian-based factions oppose the interim government, saying they do
not have enough representation.

   Yasser Arafat said Friday that President
Bush's decision to continue dialogue with the PLO is ``a very
important step which will help a peace process in the Middle East.''
   The next round of PLO-U.S. talks reportedly is scheduled in
Tunisia next week. The talks began in December after the outgoing
Reagan administration lifted a ban on contacts with Arafat's
Palestine Liberation Organization following Arafat's statement
renouncing terrorism.
   Israel assailed the U.S. decision and said Arafat's organization
continues to attack Israeli soldiers in south Lebanon.
   Arafat spoke at a news conference after addressing the
InterParliamentary Union's biannual conference in Budapest.
   The Palestinian leader told journalists Israel had been sending
secret messages to the PLO and to national movements in Lebanon to
find ``a new cease-fire agreeement'' in south Lebanon.
   He refused to say who sent the messages.
   Arafat said he was ``ready to discuss all details of a
cease-fire.''
   He denied that attacks against the Israeli army in south Lebanon
were acts of terrorism, saying one should not confuse ``resistance
against aggression with terrorism.''
   Arafat condemned the bombing of a Pan Am jet that crashed in
Lockerbie, Scotland last December, killing 270 people, and said he
was contributing to the investigation to seek those responsible.
   The Israeli delegation and the head of the U.S. delegation, Sen.
Terry Sanford, D-N.C., were not present during Arafat's address
before the InterParliamentary Union conference.
   The Israeli chief delegate, Parliament speaker Dov Shilansky,
said the conference ``extended an invitation to a man whose hands
are full of blood.''
   Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, told the Associated Press he opposed
the PLO chairman's speaking because it was ``not the purpose of the
meeting to provide a propaganda forum for Arafat.''
   Arafat appealed to the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council _ the United States, the Soviet Union, China,
France and Britain _ to agree among themselves on a Middle East
peace conference.
   He said the PLO wanted to try to find solutions at an
international peace conference ``that suit all of us,'' Palestinians
and Israelis.
   ``I stretch my hand to all in Israel,'' Arafat declared.
   Earlier Friday, he unveiled a plaque at the PLO's office in
Budapest, which has been upgraded to an embassy under an agreement
with Hungarian leaders.
   Arafat conferred in Budapest with Communist Party leader Karoly
Grosz and Premier Miklos Nemeth.
   Arafat flew to Prague late Friday, the Czechoslovak news agency
CTK said. It said he went from the airport to talks with
Czechoslovak Communist Party leader Milos Jakes that were marked by
``full understanding and identify of opinions.''

   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang
issued his strongest rebuff yet to increasingly vocal advocates of
multiparty democracy and vowed in a speech published Friday that the
party will never be supplanted.
   The speech was published on the eve of an annual legislative
session expected to witness open calls by some delegates for
democracy and an amnesty for political prisoners.
   But Zhao said China does not need opposition parties and upheaval
will not be tolerated.
   ``At present no one is satisfied with our backward condition but
in my view we don't need a new prescription,'' he told a party
seminar. ``The leadership of the Communist Party is in the interests
of the entire nation. China cannot adopt the Western multiparty
system.''
   The text of Zhao's speech, said to have been delivered in
January, filled the top half of national newspapers' front pages and
nearly a full page inside. No explanation was given for the delay in
its publication.
   It was the strongest of several recent warnings by Zhao and other
senior officials on the need for political stability as they work to
resolve thorny economic problems, including 36 percent annual
inflation.
   However, many intellectuals say China cannot solve its economic
problems and develop a market-style economy unless it relaxes
political controls.
   Xinhua, the official news agency, said Friday the government
appointed two members of ``democratic'' parties to vice-ministerial
posts.
   China has eight such parties, all operating under orders from the
Communist Party. Most of their 170,000 members _ compared to 44
million Communists _ are aging intellectuals or former capitalists.
   Those appointed were Li Peiyao of the Revolutionary Committee of
the Chinese Kuomintang in the Labor Ministry and Hong Fuzeng of the
September 3rd Society at the Agriculture Ministry.
   Several delegates to the 2,796-member National People's Congress,
China's legislature, said they will issue a call at the annual
session that begins Monday for an amnesty for prisoners of
conscience.
   More than 100 intellectuals already have signed letters to the
congress calling for such an amnesty, especially for Wei Jingsheng.
Wei was sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for
``counterrevolutionary activities.''
   But a judge, Tang Zhanyun, quashed any hopes for such an amnesty
on Friday. The official Xinhua News Agency quoted Tang as saying
Wei's sentence was just. The agency also quoted Tang as denying
China has political or ideological prisoners.
   Zhao did not mention Wei or the petitions, but his speech
indicated authorities have no intention of letting the congress
become a platform for critics of the regime.
   ``Those who dislike our party ... know there is no way from the
outside to destroy or supplant us,'' he said.
   The party, he said, is the key to resolving every national
problem, and economic development cannot succeed without its
leadership.
   But he cautioned that corruption within the party has become a
major problem and repeatedly called for tougher discipline against
corrupt party members.
   He also acknowledged conflicts within the party, saying some
members do not understand the necessity of current efforts to reduce
central economic planning in favor of market-style reforms. Others,
he said, want to move too fast.
   In his speech, Zhao called for step-by-step change and emphasized
that China will never reject socialism for capitalism. Although some
private ownership is permitted, public ownership must remain
dominant, he said.
   ``Some people ... compare China with developed nations and think
socialism is no good,'' Zhao said. But he rejected such comparisons,
saying China was starting from a lower level of development.
   ``If you compare China with foreign capitalist countries at the
same level of development. ... There is none that doesn't have gaps
between rich and poor, social unrest and political upheaval,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Heavy Snow In Upper Midwest, Record Warmth In East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cold air surging into the north-central part of the nation
produced heavy snow Friday over parts of the upper Midwest, while
sections of the East had unseasonably warm weather.
   Snow fell from the northern High Plains through the middle
Missouri Valley to Michigan during the afternoon, with heavy snow
across parts of South Dakota and Wisconsin.
   Snowfall totals in Minnesota ranged up to 7.5 inches at
Farmington by mid morning and up to a foot of snow was expected to
blanket central Wisconsin by Saturday morning.
   The snow was expected to spread across the upper Great Lakes
region into northern New England, and a winter storm watch was
posted for Saturday for northern Vermont and northeastern New York
state.
   South of the snow belt, a mixture of snow, sleet and freezing
rain extended across northern Iowa, southern Wisconsin and northern
Illinois, and showers and thunderstorms spread over parts of central
Illinois.
   Strong, gusty wind blew across the central Rockies and the
central high Plains during the morning, with gusts to 85 mph
reported in the Loveland ski area of Colorado and gusts to 58 mph in
Nebraska at Scottsbluff and Sydney.
   A low pressure system off the northern Pacific Coast produced
light showers over western Oregon and northern California, with snow
at higher elevations of western Oregon.
   Elsewhere, southern Florida had light showers.
   A cold front curving through the central and eastern part of the
nation created a sharp contrast in temperatures.
   Afternoon temperatures were generally below freezing from the
northern Rockies through the northern and central Plains to northern
New England. And readings were only in the teens and single digits
from Montana through the Dakotas to Upper Michigan and northern
Lower Michigan.
   Ahead of the front, temperatures were generally in the 70s and
80s across the south-central and southeastern states.
   Boston tied its record of 66 degrees, and in West Virginia,
Beckley warmed to a record 73 and Huntington hit a record 76.
   Temperatures around the nation at 2 p.m. EST ranged from 7
degrees at Cut Bank, Mont., Warroad, Minn., and Watertown, S.D., to
88 at McAllen, Texas. Friday's low for the Lower 48 states was 24
degrees below zero at Hibbing, Minn.
   For Saturday, rain was forecast from the upper Ohio Valley and
the lower Great Lakes region across the middle and northern Atlantic
Coast states, with snow and freezing rain in northern New England.
Scattered showers and thunderstorms were forecast over the lower
Mississippi Valley and the central Gulf Coast states. Snow was
forecast over the northern Rockies and the northern high Plains, and
scattered showers were forecast across the northern and central
Pacific Coast region.
   Highs in the 20s and lower 30s were predicted from Montana
through Minnesota to Upper Michigan, and across northern Maine; in
the 40s from the central Rockies through the middle and upper
Mississippi Valley to northern New England; above 70 from southern
California through southern and central Texas to the southern and
middle Atlantic Coast region; and in the 80s in the desert Southwest
and from south-central Texas to Florida and southern Georgia.

<TEXT>
   More than 50,000 Moslems left mosques
and marched throughout the capital Friday before gathering at the
government's headquarters to demand the death of author Salman
Rushdie.
   Also Friday about 3,000 Moslem fundamentalists in Sudan, some
shouting ``Down, down with Britain!'' demanded that Sudan break
relations with the British government which has defended publication
of Rushdie's book ``The Satanic Verses.''
   In Malaysia, the government banned the March 13 issue of Newsweek
magazine and the March 9 issues of the Hong Kong-based Far Eastern
Economic Review for printing extracts from the book.
   Many Moslems find the book blasphemous because it suggests the
prophet Mohammed wrote the Koran instead of receiving it from God
and because its characters include prostitutes who take the names of
Mohammed's wives.
   Several countries including Bangladesh and Malaysia have banned
the book, and Iran has offered $5.2 million to any Moslem who kills
Rushdie, an Indian-born Briton of Moslem upbringing.
   Marchers in Dhaka chanted ``We will kill Rushdie'' and gathered
near the Secretariat, the headquarters of the government. Several
hundred policemen in riot gear followed the marchers but there was
no violence.
   More than 15,000 followers of Jamaat-e-Islami, a fundamentalist
Moslem party, held another rally in front of the city's main mosque
and religious leaders accused Zionists of ``conspiring against Islam
and its prophet Mohammed.''
   Seven of the country's top religious leaders have called for a
nationwide general strike on Tuesday to protest the book.
   A youth organization has set up a 15-member death squad to kill
Rushdie if he comes to Bangladesh. The group is led by Farooq Ahmed,
who said the squad had no plans to go to London to kill Rushdie, who
is in hiding somewhere in Britain.
   The demonstrators in the Sudanese capital, Khartoum, urged the
government to break relations with Britain and boycott all its goods.
   The protest, led by the fundamenalist National Islamic Front, is
seen as the party's first sign of opposition to Prime Minister Sadek
Mahdi.
   Mahdi is in the process of forming a new broad-based government
that would start talks with Sudan's southern rebels to end the
6-year-old civil war.
   The National Islamic Front has said it will not join the new
government because negotiations and a peace treaty with the rebel
Sudan People's Liberation Army would mean a suspension of the
Islamic Sharia law.
   Malaysia's deputy home affairs minister, Megat Junid Megat Ayub,
told reporters the Newsweek and Far Eastern Economic Review issues
were banned because the contents would have a deterimental effect on
Moslems, whose faith is the official religion.
   The Malaysian Home Affairs Ministry must receive a copy of all
incoming foreign publications including newspapers. Sometimes
articles or parts of articles are blackened out and occasionally the
entire issue is banned.

   NBC's Saturday morning cartoon
lineup will be interrupted by the space shuttle Discovery's landing,
but the network's coverage will be geared for the younger audience,
a spokeswoman said.
   The network will pre-empt its ``Smurfs'' cartoon series to air
the shuttle's touchdown, which is scheduled for 6:35 a.m. PST, NBC
spokeswoman Helen Manasian said Friday.
   The anticipated younger audience prompted NBC to ``target the
coverage to appeal to kids,'' Ms. Manasian said. Vocabulary,
graphics and discussions will ``be geared for kids.''
   The coverage, which will last about 10 minutes, will be anchored
by Connie Chung. Astronaut George ``Pinky'' Nelson will be at the
Johnson Space Center to help with commentary, Ms. Manasian said.
   CBS also will interrupt its cartoon lineup with the shuttle
landing, but it plans no special changes in its coverage for the
younger audience. ABC will be on stand-by for live coverage, but it
has no plans to pre-empt its program.

   A soldier who wants a discharge so she can
care for her infant daughter said Thursday she has no hard feelings
against the Army but has found that military service and motherhood
don't mix.
   ``I like the Army. I have nothing bad to say about it. I just
don't feel it's right for me,'' Spec. 4 Cheryl Beekman said in an
interview from her office at Fort Eustis in Newport News.
   Ms. Beekman, 21, filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court after she
received orders to leave for South Korea without her 6-month-old
daughter, Lauren, and the Army denied her request for a discharge.
   The Army agreed Wednesday to postpone her transfer while the
court case is pending, but Ms. Beekman said she is still anxious to
leave the service before her four-year hitch ends next year.
   ``I want out. It has nothing to do with going to South Korea,
really,'' she said. ``I have a hard time being in the military with
a child. That's what it comes down to. There's long hours, overnight
guard duties, just everything, 24-hour duties.''
   Ms. Beekman said she would consider staying in the Army only if
she were based near Tacoma, Wash., where her husband moved in
October to take a job.
   ``I've been a single parent since the first of October,'' she
said. ``I just had a hard time with it.''
   Ms. Beekman said other women at the base have been discharged
because they had babies, but she doesn't feel she has been singled
out. She said the Army has a shortage overseas in her specialty of
graphics illustration.
   The Army and other services offer pregnant women in uniform the
option of leaving the military before the baby is born. Otherwise,
they must apply for a hardship discharge, which can be granted in
case of a death in the family, a need to support family members, and
a variety of emergencies.
   Of the 250,000 women on active duty in all four branches last
year, 4,815 left the service because of pregnancy and 855 got
hardship discharges, said Maj. David Super, a Defense Department
spokesman.
   Ms. Beekman's lawyer, Kenneth E. Labowitz, said his client would
have to leave her baby with her husband or mother if she is sent to
South Korea.
   ``I've been a good soldier. I've never been in trouble,'' Ms.
Beekman said. ``I don't think my child should be punished for a
mistake I made.''

<HEAD>Senate Votes to Ban Displaying Flag on the Floor</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Senate, reacting to a controversial Chicago
art exhibit, approved on a 97-0 vote Thursday a bill expanding
federal law against desecration of the flag to include placing it on
the floor or on the ground.
   ``I don't know much about art, but I know desecration when I see
it,'' Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., the measure's
sponsor, said in a statement.
   The move came in response to an exhibit by a student at the
School of the Art Institute of Chicago in which an American flag was
displayed on the floor in a fashion that resulted in spectators
standing on it.
   ``What Is The Proper Way To Display The U.S. Flag,'' is the name
of the exhibit, which for the last four weeks has brought throngs of
angry demonstrators to march in front of the museum on Michigan
Avenue in the heart of downtown Chicago.
   Dole's bill would expand existing law against flag desecration to
include the words ``knowingly displayed ... on the floor or ground.''
   Dole said the Chicago display ``is not an appropriate use of this
nation's symbol of freedom _ our flag.''
   ``Quite frankly, it shows direspect and contempt for our flag,
and should be expressly prohibited by law,'' he said.
   The controversy followed last year's furor over an Art Institute
student's painting of the late Mayor Harold Washington wearing
women's garments.
   Emotions ran so high at that time that one alderman stormed into
the museum and ripped down the portrait of Washington, much beloved
among black Chicagoans and members of the city's independent
political movement.
   The flag exhibit by 24-year-old art student Scott Tyler was to be
taken down on Thursday after being on display for four weeks.
   It already has drawn censure from the Illinois state House of
Representatives. But a judge quickly threw out a lawsuit aimed at
having the exhibit removed from public display.

   The search was to have begun on March 4 but Laos postponed it in

Laos of not cooperating in U.S. efforts to curb narcotics
trafficking.
   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said a team of U.S.

<TEXT>
   California's public health chief assured
apple-lovers Friday that tests indicated the fruit is safe to eat,
and the state's schools were told to return apples to lunch rooms.
   ``An apple a day ...'' is excellent diet policy, state health
director Dr. Kenneth W. Kizer suggested at a news conference.
   ``The message to mom and dad out there is that these are safe,
you can eat `em; there's no problem,'' Kizer said.
   At the center of the controversy is the chemical daminozide, sold
under the trade name Alar, which the EPA said has caused cancer in
test animals. Last month an environmental group issued a report
suggesting that children are especially at risk from Alar because
they eat many times more apples and apple products, compared to
their weight, than adults.
   Alar has been used as a spray on some apples to increase
firmness, enhance color and extend storage life.
   Kizer said tests of canned apple juice, apple slices and apple
sauce taken from Department of Education warehouses failed to show
residues of Alar or related compounds greater than 0.055 parts per
million.
   The residues are ``approximately 400 times below the legally
allowed tolerance for daminozide in apple and apple products,'' he
said.
   On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Food and Drug
Administration and Environmental Protection Agency pronounced apple
and apple products safe to eat.
   ``There's no foundation or basis for the scare,'' Kizer said.
``It got going, and whatever it was got it going it steamrolled.''
   Kizer declined to place blame, but estimated the scare would
probably cost state agencies ``a few hundred thousand dollars'' for
the tests and other expenses.
   Kizer said he had advised state schools Superintendent Bill Honig
``that there is no real threat to the health of children from the
consumption of the apple products we tested.
   ``I have urged that fresh and canned apples and other fruits and
vegetables be served as a regular part of the diet of all California
school children, and I urge parents who have withdrawn those
products from their childrens' diets to begin serving them again.''
   Kizer said the state tests were conducted at the state's food and
drug laboratories in Emeryville, and results were confirmed at the
University of California at Davis.

<HEAD>AIDS Infections From Hospital's Unsterilized Syringe Rises to 49</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of mothers and children known to be
infected with the fatal AIDS virus by nurses using an unsterilized
syringe at a provincial hospital has risen to 49, Soviet health
officials said Friday.
   Officials expect to find several more victims as the
investigation continues, said Valentin Pokrovsky, president of the
Academy of Sciences.
   Speaking at a news briefing on an international conference in
Moscow on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, Pokrovsky said 21 of
the 49 already identified are children.
   He blamed the tragedy in Elista, a city near the Caspian Sea, on
health workers who used the same syringe to inject drugs into the
intravenous feeding catheters of numerous patients.
   The AIDS virus damages the body's immune system, leaving victims
susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often
through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers,
infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their
offspring.
   The Soviet Union suffers extreme shortages of numerous products,
including syringes. The country produced just 30 million disposable
syringes last year, while health workers dispensed 3 billion
injections, said Deputy Health Minister Alexander Kondrusev.
   Nurses are supposed to sterilize their reusable syringes between
patients, but this apparently was not done in Elista, he said. Nor
do disposable syringes solve the problem, because they too are often
used repeatedly, he said.
   ``We still have cases of health workers using syringes not
properly boiled, or simply changing needles,'' he said. ``There
should be a system of responsibility'' to prevent such dangerous
behavior, he continued.
   A government newspaper recently commented on a shortage of
condoms, which doctors say are an effective way to stem the spread
of AIDS.
   The Elista case began when a Soviet man contracted AIDS in
Africa,then came home and transmitted it to his wife. She or her
child apparently was a patient in the maternity hospital last June
when the infections began.
   Pokrovsky said it is possible some of the mothers contracted the
fatal, slow-acting virus from their nursing infants. Scientists
found that all of the children in this group _ who were already
seriously ill and confined to an intensive care ward _ had mouth
infections. They believe infected blood from the babies' mouths
entered the mothers through their nipples to the lymph glands, but
this is not yet proven, Prokrovsky said.
   So far, authorities have identified only eight people who have
developed AIDS symptoms in the Soviet Union, Kondrusev and Pokrovsky
said. Three African victims have died, as have three Soviets. Two
other Soviets are being treated.
   Kondrusev said the Soviet Union has found 554 carriers of the
infectious virus, including 378 foreigners and 176 Soviets. All of
the foreigners have been deported or are in the process of leaving,
he said.
   All of the Soviet infections came from sexual activity, except
for the Elista cases, said Kondrusev. The Soviet Union has not yet
had an AIDS case caused by drug abusers sharing needles, he said.
   Worldwide, 142,000 people have developed the deadly disease, and
an estimated 5 to 10 million are infected, according to World Health
Organization statistics offered at the briefing.
   Pokrovsky said a few Soviets are panicking about AIDS but he is
more concerned that most citizens are utterly indifferent to the
danger. ``We need to explain that their safety depends on their
individual actions,'' he said.

   Israeli soldiers clashed with guerrillas who
apparently infiltrated into Israel from Jordan on Friday, and at
least two soldiers were wounded, the army said.
   But knowledgeable Israeli sources said one soldier was killed and
another wounded in the 10 p.m. attack. They said on condition of
anonymity that the guerrillas apparently crossed the border back
into Jordan.
   An army spokesman said an initial report showed the guerrillas
crossed into Israel near the southern border communal farm of Ein
Yahav, 74 miles south of Jerusalem.
   Two Israeli soldiers were wounded in the ensuing firefight, the
spokesman said. He said no details were available.
   One soldier who was shot and slightly wounded in the arm was
treated at the Soroka Hospital in the southern town of Beersheva,
hospital spokeswoman Tami Lunenfeld said.
   On Wednesday, two Palestinian guerrillas slipped across border in
the occupied Gaza Strip town of Rafah and hurled a grenade at an
army outpost. The guerrillas were captured by Israeli troops. There
were no Israeli casualties.
   On Friday, one of the guerrillas, 18-year-old Iman Mohammed
Hassan Yunis from the Canada refugee camp on the Egyptian side of
Rafah, said he has been operating on orders from Yasser Arafat's
Fatah wing of the PLO.
   Wednesday's raid was the first attempted infiltration attributed
to Fatah since Arafat in December renounced terrorism and recognized
Israel's right to exist. After Arafat's statements, the United
States launched a dialogue with the PLO.
   U.S. officials reportedly have sought to work out a cease-fire
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization to stop
infiltrations from Lebanon. The PLO claims these are attacks on
military targets that are not included in Arafat's renunciation of
terrorism.
   Army officials say at least 30 guerrillas have been killed in
southern Lebanon this year while attempting to cross into Israel.
Five were killed in two attempts this week.
   The last infiltration from Jordan was on May 17, 1988. One Arab
guerrilla was wounded and captured, and two escaped during that raid.

   Leftist rebels frightened city
mayors and election officials into quitting, but a guerrilla
commander said Friday they will not attack polling places or people
who vote in the presidential election.
   The rebels have declared a traffic ban before Sunday's vote,
threatening to attack vehicles.
   No commercial traffic moved on rural highways, and rebel sabotage
kept much of El Salvador without power. At least one van was
attacked with a firebomb, news reports said.
   Few buses operated in San Salvador, but army trucks carried
people and some pickup trucks took passengers for fares.
   ``You can't stop people,'' said a driver named Roberto, who said
he was charging the normal bus fare of 20 cents. ``I did not come
out yesterday, but I need to work so here I am.''
   All three leading candidates have condemned the rebel actions and
stressed their efforts to end a 9-year-old civil war that has cost
more than 70,000 lives.
   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the
rebels had received large deliveries of AK-47 assault rifles and
ammunition from Cuba in the past few months. Other officials,
speaking privately, said at least some were shipped through
Nicaragua.
   Redman said the deliveries contradicted guerrilla claims of
interest in a peace settlement.
   Campaigning ended Wednesday by law. In preliminary polling, Fidel
Chavez Mena of President Jose Napoleon Duarte's Christian Democratic
Party trails coffee millionaire Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist
Republican Nationalist Alliance, known as Arena.
   Guillermo Ungo, a former leader of the rebel political wing, is a
distant third for the leftist Democratic Convergence. Four minor
candidates also are running.
   The mayors of Chalatenango, the northern provincial capital, and
Metapan, a northwestern city, resigned under threats from the rebel
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. More than half the
country's municipalities are without mayors, and nine mayors have
been assassinated.
   Election officials in three precincts near the eastern city of
San Miguel were reported to have resigned. The guerrillas have told
election officials to quit before Sunday.
   A guerrilla commander in northern Cabanas province told The
Associated Press that no attacks would be made on polling places or
civilians voting on election day, but right-wing squads might attack
civilians disguised as guerrillas.
   A member of the guerrilla front's political bureau based in
Mexico City, Ana Guadalupe Martinez, said: ``We will not directly
attack those who are voting. Those who vote have to have that
guarantee.''
   She also said the rebels were urging election officials to quit
but had not threatened to kill them.
   Rebel leaders declared the boycott after making an unsuccessful
offer to participate if the election was postponed until fall and
fairness could be guaranteed. Their expressed aim is to discredit
the election and force new negotiations on their proposal.
   Polls indicate no candidate will get a majority, which would mean
a runoff in April, but reliable polling is difficult because many
voters are afraid to express an honest preference.
   Cristiani, the Arena candidate, says he would offer the rebels a
choice of laying down their weapons to join the political process or
facing ``the efficient use of the armed forces.''
   Duarte's attempts to improve the stagnating economy have been
hampered by the war and, critics say, corruption and mismanagement.
He is barred by the constitution from seeking a second five-year
term.
   The Christian Democrats' performance in office has hurt their
candidate Chavez Mena, who promises to negotiate peace without
power-sharing arrangements the guerrillas want.
   Ungo has dismissed both his opponents with the statement: ``One
does not want peace and the other cannot bring it about.''
   The government election council said the army would distribute
voting materials across the country on Saturday.

<HEAD>Stocks, Bonds Plunge Following News Of Higher Inflation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with 3 grafs to update with final closing market and bond
prices, biggest drop since last April. A version moving on financial wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock and bond prices plunged Friday after the
government reported another surge in wholesale prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell about 50
points in the opening minutes of trading, then stabilized and
finished 48.57 points lower at 2,292.14. It was the biggest drop
since a 101.46-point plunge last April 14.
   Prices of long-term government bonds, which are highly sensitive
to inflation speculation, were down more than $17 for every $1,000
in face value by late in the trading day.
   Lower bond prices mean higher interest rates. The yield on the
Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond leaped to about 9.3 percent from
about 9.1 percent late Thursday.
   The Labor Department said Friday that wholesale prices, pushed up
by surging energy and food costs, soared 1.0 percent in February
after an identical rise in January.
   The back-to-back increases mean inflation at the wholesale level
one stop short of retail is running at a 12.6 percent annual rate so
far in 1989. That is more than triple the 4.0 percent increase for
all of last year.
   Both large jumps have surprised analysts, who in advance of both
reports had predicted moderate rises of about 0.4 percent. After
January's numbers were reported, economists dismissed them as an
aberration and said inflation would return to the 4 percent to 5
percent annual pace of late last year.
   The stock market lost ground late in the session after
International Business Machines Corp. said a short-term chip problem
had caused delays in deliveries of mainframe computers and that it
expects first-quarter earnings to be below the range of security
analysts' estimates.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This situation often prompts heavy trading by professionals
engaged in computer program strategies that involve both the options
and futures and individual stocks.

<HEAD>Anti-Drug Officer Rejects Allegations by Helms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mexico's chief drug enforcement officer
rejected claims by U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms that Mexico has a dismal
record in combatting drugs. Congressmen urged the government to
formally respond to Helms' allegations.
   ``It is obvious these people haven't the faintest idea of what we
are doing in Mexico and are deliberately ignoring the high cost we
are paying in lives and money,'' Deputy Attorney General Javier
Coello Trejo said in comments published Friday in the
English-language Mexico City News.
   Helms, R-N.C., introduced a measure in the Senate Thursday that
would revoke a presidential finding that Mexico is ``fully
cooperating'' with the U.S. government in the anti-drug war. The
measure would make Mexico ineligible for U.S. financial assistance.
   President Bush is required by law to certify that certain nations
are cooperating in the campaign against drugs. The State Department
extended certification for Mexico this month but said corruption is
a continuing problem.
   Mexico is a major transfer point for drugs, especially cocaine,
smuggled from South America to the United States. It also is a big
U.S. supplier of marijuana and heroin according to State Department
statistics.
   Coello, without mentioning Helms by name, said U.S. senators
critical of Mexican efforts should come to Mexico and ``watch while
our agents, backed by soldiers, fight to the death with men armed
with high-powered automatic weapons and finally capture and destroy
stocks of drugs ready to market.''
   Coello suggested that U.S. critics of Mexico look into the demand
by U.S. drug consumers.
   ``Where there is a buyer there is always a seller,'' he said.
   Congressman Victor Hugo Celaya of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party said that if Mexico's anti-drug efforts fall
short ``it isn't for lack of political will but because of the
economic crisis the country faces.''
   ``We are acting permanently against this social disease, not
because of the need to obtain a certificate of good conduct but
because it concerns state security,'' said Celaya, chairman of the
congressional Border Affairs Committee.
   Representatives of the leftist and conservative opposition
denounced Helms and called for the Foreign Ministry to issue a
statement.
   The U.S. Senate voted last year to revoke former President
Reagan's certification of Mexican cooperation in the anti-drug
battle, but the House did not support the move.
   Mexico criticized the certification process as meddling in its
internal affairs.
   Five members of the Federal Judicial Police have been killed in
gun battles with drug traffickers since Dec. 1, according to the
Attorney General's Office. A total of 52 government agents and 113
army troopers have been slain in anti-narcotics operations since
December 1982.

   A judge on Friday urged imprisoned soul singer
James Brown to refrain from using drugs, but did not lengthen his
jail time for having drugs in his system during a probation check in
December.
   ``I would hope that you can put your troubles behind you,''
Circuit Judge Rodney Peeples told Brown. ``I believe you can still
do a lot of good for a lot of people. I would urge you, please, to
stay off drugs.''
   After making his admonition, the judge revoked a probationary
sentence Brown received last July 24 following his conviction for
resisting arrest and carrying a pistol. Brown could have been
ordered to serve a one-year jail term.
   But Peeples dismissed six months of that sentence and ordered the
``Godfather of Soul'' to serve the remaining time concurrently with
a six-year prison term Brown began serving Dec. 29 following his
conviction on charges stemming from a Sept. 24 car chase with police
from two states.
   Friday's hearing was ordered after Brown tested positive for
marijuana and PCP in violation of his probation for the July case.
   Brown, 55, said after the hearing that he is faring well in
prison. He said he is getting a much-needed rest, learning to cook
and counseling other inmates at the State Park Correctional
Institute near Columbia.
   ``It's not really a low point,'' said Brown, dressed in a suit
and tie. ``A lot can be gained'' from the time in prison, he added.
   Brown is eligible for parole on May 12, 1991, but a nationwide
movement is pressing for an early release. Among his supporters are
civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, who appeared before the state
parole board on Brown's behalf earlier this month.
   Brown's lawyers plan to ask the state parole board on May 29 for
a pardon, one of Brown's attorneys, George Hill Jr., said Friday.
   Brown said that even though he is incarcerated, his career is
``going faster than I can catch up with it.''
   An album he recorded in December with Aretha Franklin is
scheduled to be released soon and Cinemax is broadcasting Brown's
November concert tour in Italy.
   Brown's album, ``I'm Real,'' released in August, also is selling
well, according to officials with the Scotti Brothers record
company. This week, his music was used to awaken the space shuttle
Discovery's five astronauts.
   Also Friday, probation officials filed a complaint alleging that
a benefit concert Brown performed on Dec. 4 as part of his July
sentence raised enough money only to cover expenses and no money for
charity.
   Defense attorney Bill Weeks blamed that, in part, on bad
publicity and the judge dismissed the complaint, saying he was
convinced the singer had made a good-faith effort to raise money for
charity.
   Brown also is scheduled to appear in court in North Augusta in
mid-April on a charge of driving under the influence.

   The Bush administration announced a stepped-up
inspection plan for imported fruit on Friday, clearing the way for
new shipments of Chilean produce to U.S. supermarkets after a
week-long health scare sparked by cyanide-tainted grapes.
   Under the plan, Chilean fruit already held by importers,
wholesalers and retailers in the United States is to be destroyed
``to eliminate fruit that cannot be practically inspected,'' said
Frank Young, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
   Under the new inspection safeguards, ``we believe that this
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from
Chile,'' Young said at a news conference.
   He said that while not every piece of fruit will be inspected,
the plan is ``based on the assumptions of the type of sampling that
would be required to have a high confidence of detecting anything if
something is there.''
   ``It is impossible to assure 100 percent safety,'' he said.
   Chilean grapes, which make up the bulk of grapes on sale this
time of year, and other fruit could be back on the shelves of U.S.
stores in less than a week, officials said.
   The plan was announced despite a new poisoning threat received by
the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Young said. He said the third threat
raises no more concern than two earlier ones, which preceded
discovery of the tainted grapes, though officials believe the caller
may be the same.
   As the government inspection plan was being announced,
longshoremen in Florida began unloading boxes of Chilean fruit from
a ship that has been anchored off Tampa for the past few days.
   Responsibility to see that fruit already in the United States is
dumped lies with state health departments, Young said.
   About 5 percent of Chilean fruit at U.S. docks or in transit to
the United States will be visually inspected and all
suspicious-looking fruit will be subjected to laboratory tests
before it is released.
   In addition, Chile will begin increased security surveillance of
fruit still in that country awaiting export, Young said. A team of
FDA inspectors will fly to the South American country soon to
oversee that effort.
   ``As always, we believe consumers should inspect all products,
regardless of country of origin,'' Young said. ``In this particular
case, consumers should look especially for injection marks, any
unusual appearance or discoloration or chemical or `burned almond'
smell.''
   Neither FDA nor representatives of Chilean exporters could give
figures on the value of the fruit to be destroyed.
   Young said grapes _ which constitute about 70 percent of Chile's
sales in the United States _ raspberries, blueberries, blackberries
and strawberries will be the first fruits to be released because
cyanide contamination of those fruits is the easiest to spot since
the fruit discolors and becomes mushy.
   These Chilean fruits will be on store shelves within five to nine
days, Young said, but he had no estimate of time for return of the
other Chilean fruit exports, including melons, cantaloupes, pears,
apples, nectarines, plums and peaches. Once fruit has been
inspected, crates will be labeled as such so wholesalers and
retailers can be assured of its safety, he said.
   He said that since the small amounts of cyanide were found in two
seedless red grapes over the weekend, no additional evidence of
contamination has been uncovered. He said 13,000 crates of fruit
have been inspected since the two poisoned grapes were found.
   Minutes before Young announced details of the plan, President
Bush said the FDA's action in taking Chilean fruit off the market
``has cost some economic hardship that I regret.''
   However, he added, ``I think when the health of the American
people might be threatened you've got to take prudent action.''
   Discovery of the poisoned grapes touched off a major public
health scare in this country and economic difficulties of a
different sort in Chile, where fruit is a major export and where
thousands of agricultural workers have been threatened with the loss
of their jobs during the peak harvest season.
   Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz called the U.S.
decision ``a workable solution'' and said ``we are very grateful.''
   ``It takes into account the interest of the U.S. citizens and the
Chileans, the consumers and the workers from Chile,'' he said at the
White House, where he met with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Young said questions about who would bear the cost of the lost
fruit and the inspections are not his to consider. ``The day I start
to look at health with regard to somebody's left hip pocket or
pocketbook, then I am not focusing enough in regard to safety,'' he
said.
   Some economic impact will be felt by American consumers, who are
likely to soon see, at least temporarily, higher prices for fruit on
supermarket shelves, said economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia
State University.
   ``Most of what will be left on the shelves will be hothouse grown
(domestically) and that will be more expensive,'' he said.
   In Santiago, after hearing that the U.S. government had lifted
the restrictions, the military government announced a package of
economic measures to counter the damage caused by the crisis of the
nation's booming fruit export industry.
   President Augusto Pinochet said he signed a bill authorizing the
government to make emergency loans to affected fruit growers and
exporters. Also, he said, the government will buy part of the
production the exporters were not able to sell abroad.
   Interior Minister Carlos Caceres said the government will also
aid exporters to finance a mass advertising campaign abroad aimed at
recovering the consumers' confidence, especially in the United
States.
   Effective immediately, Caceres said, the government will
implement a $12 million emergency job program in the fruit-growing
regions to hire workers who lost their jobs as a result of the
temporary paralization of the fruit industry.
   In addition, tue government will encourage banks to re-negotiate
credits with fruit businessmen.
   In the foreign front, Caceres added, the government will seek new
credits from the World Bank and will re-negotiate standing
agreements with the International monetary funds. He did not
elaborate.

   Twenty years ago, students and teachers
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology started a movement
against what they considered a dangerous trend of focusing
technology on military expansion.
   What started out as an MIT teach-in and became known as the Union
of Concerned Scientists has grown two decades later into an
influential national organization promoting social and environmental
uses of technology and nuclear arms reduction.
   The organization claims 100,000 contributing members and a
30-member staff in Cambridge and Washington engaged in research,
lobbying and litigation.
   On Wednesday night, about 200 people celebrated the group's
anniversary at the Boston Museum of Science. At the reception, the
UCS previewed a video on the group's policy on avoiding perilous
global warming known as the greenhouse effect.
   Among those present was Henry W. Kendall, an MIT physics
professor and Defense Department consultant who has been chairman of
the union's board since 1973.
   Kendall's involvement traces to the group's inception as the
March Fourth Movement. On the MIT campus on March 4, 1969, the
university's regular activities were disrupted for weeklong
discussions on the Vietnam War, which those participating thought
was unwinnable.
   At the time, MIT was designing components for nuclear weaponry,
which many students and faculty opposed. Kendall and other
instructors released a faculty statement outlining their goals as:
   _ A ``continuing examination of governmental policy in areas
where science and technology are of actual or potential
significance.''
   _ To direct the ``emphasis on military technology'' towards
environmental and social problems.
   _ To encourage students to focus their scientific and
technological energies on serving mankind, and to ``scrutinize the
issues ... before participating in the construction of destructive
weapons systems.''
   Howard Ris, the union's executive director since 1984, said the
group is celebrating the end of the Reagan era. The union opposed
President Reagan on many issues, such as his Strategic Defense
Initiative and his relaxation of regulations restricting auto
emissions.
   Nevertheless, Kendall says the group has worked with liberals and
conservatives alike to pursue its goals.
   ``We've been against a number of technically unsatisfactory
weapons systems, like Star Wars, that were ill-chosen and unwise,''
Kendall said. ``Our views have now become the standard reaction.''
   Perceptions of the group in Washington, D.C., vary.
   A public relations worker for the Heritage Foundation, a
conservative think tank, when asked about the Union of Concerned
Scientists, said, ``They're a peace group, right?''
   But Michael Mariotte, the director of the Nuclear Information and
Resource Service, said: ``We've got a lot of respect for them. They
have the expertise we and a lot of other people rely on.''
   ``Of course, we don't agree on every single thing,'' Mariotte
said. As an example, Mariotte pointed to the union's support of
further development of advanced nuclear reactors, which his
organization is against.

<HEAD>Prince Says US Supports Resistance But Does Not Promise Arms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Prince Norodom Rinariddh, whose father leads the
Cambodian resistance, said Friday the United States had expressed
``strong and clear'' support but gave no commitment to provide arms.
   He told reporters after several days of talks in Washington the
question of military assistance is being debated, but ``we haven't
gotten any aid from the United States.''
   Rinariddh is the military commander of guerrillas led by his
father Prince Norodom Sihanouk, the former ruler of Cambodia.
   The three-party resistance coalition also includes a
non-communist group led by former Premier Son Sann and the communist
Khmer Rouge, who gained control of Cambodia in 1975 and conducted a
reign of terror in which at least 1 million people died before the
Vietnamese invasion of December 1978.
   After the news conference, Rinariddh met with Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar about the Cambodian situation, possible U.N.
supervision of a Vietnamese withdrawal and a proposed U.N.-sponsored
peace conference. There was no immediate report on their discussions.
   The prince said the non-communist resistance groups wanted U.S.
military aid to give them greater strength relative to the Khmer
Rouge, the main fighting force, and enable them to compete more
effectively in a future settlement.
   He told the journalists, however: ``To be very frank, I do not
have a clear and positive response to my requirement to have lethal
aid to the non-communists.''
   He said there were indications of support and ``the reaction
appeared to me to be very positive,'' but ``I can't say I'm 100
percent sure the U.S. will provide lethal assistance.''
   Bush administration sources have said privately they discussed
the possibility of increasing assistance to the non-communist
factions, projected to be $7.5 million in non-lethal aid for fiscal
1990.
   They added, however, that the administration opposes providing
military aid. China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
are the major providers of arms and the administration is satisfied
with the status quo, the sources said.

   As longshoreman began unloading crates of
fresh Chilean fruit, importers and wholesalers struggled Friday to
add up losses caused by a Food and Drug Administration order to
destroy the fruit already in storage.
   Most industry sources said losses would be in the tens of
millions of dollars, with wholesalers and retailers bearing the
brunt of the five-day health scare provoked by the discovery of
cyanide traces in two Chilean grapes. Across the country, importers
and wholesalers met, attempting to interpret the announcement by FDA
Commissioner Frank Young that Chilean fruit would be allowed back on
the U.S. market with increased federal inspection.
   Young said, however, that fruit already imported must be
destroyed if it ``cannot be practically inspected.'' Under the
order, fruit at some ports and docks would be inspected, but most in
storage must be eliminated.
   ``There's millions of dollars worth of fruit in storage right
now,'' said Caryl Saunders, a spokeswoman for the 46-member Chilean
Winter Fruit Association in San Francisco. ``Everybody stands to
lose.''
   At inland distribution points like Chicago, the FDA announcement
sent wholesalers into despair, Ms. Saunders said. ``They're so
depressed, they're just all going home.''
   The mood was better at David Oppenheimer California, Inc., in the
seaport of Long Beach, where much of the fruit arrives for West
Coast distribution.
   Oppenheimer and other importers believe they can salvage some
sales of their fruit now on the docks and waiting in boats offshore,
if it can be inspected before it deteriorates, said Rick Eastes,
vice president-general manager.
   But he estimated losses industrywide during the fruit scare would
equal tens of millions of dollars.
   ``There's going to be some major economic loss,'' he said. ``We
don't know what's happened to consumer confidence.''
   Eastes estimated nationwide sales of Chilean fruit at $75 million
to $100 million per week and added, ``We've gone one entire week
without selling.''
   The company faced another five to nine days before fruit could be
inspected for distribution, he said. In that time, much of the fruit
would deteriorate and become unsaleable.
   In Tampa, Fla., longshoremen began unloading nearly 170,000 boxes
of Chilean fruit from a ship that left Chile 13 days ago and has
been at anchor the last few days.
   Federal agents immediately started inspecting the $3 million
cargo of grapes, peaches, plums, apples, nectarines and pears, a
process that was expected to last into the weekend.
   The Chilean Winter Fruit Association was unable to provide a
precise dollar amount on losses expected if all fruit in storage
must be destroyed, nor was the American Produce Association, which
represents 65 Chilean importers.
   ``That's the question of the day,'' said spokesman Jay Watkins,
who said American Produce Association officials were in meetings,
attempting to identify losses.
   The FDA also was unable to provide figures, said spokesman Don
McLearn.
   Von's supermarkets, one of California's largest supermarket
chains, on Thursday began destroying cases of fruit that had been
opened and placed on display, said Von's spokesman Vickie Sanders.
   The fruit was taken to landfills and buried, and unopened cases
were returned to the supplier for credit, she said. Chilean fruit
probably will not appear on Von's shelves again until next weekend,
she said.
   ``We'd like to wait till there's brand new shipments. We want
fresh fruit, and we want to make sure it has the FDA stamp of
approval,'' Ms. Sanders said.

   The Bush administration and congressional
Democrats were on the verge of agreement Friday on a new policy
toward Nicaragua that would bring a rare note of bipartisanship to
U.S. actions in the region.
   ``We're not far apart,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.,
commenting on a proposed bipartisan policy statement that was being
drafted. ``Compared to the (contentiousness of) the past eight
years, we're down to splitting hairs.''
   But final agreement on the two-page document, stamped ``SECRET,''
eluded negotiators despite a flurry of personal visits in Capitol
Hill offices by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. More meetings
were scheduled for Monday.
   The agreement includes a broad statement of policy goals worked
out over the past three weeks in a series of meetings between Baker
and congressional leaders, according to congressional sources.
   President Bush, speaking to reporters, said he wanted the policy
statement to put an end to the fractiousness that dominated the
issue during President Reagan's years in office. ``I want to see
something worked out where ... America speaks with one voice,'' Bush
said. ``It is not helpful to the foreign policy objectives to have
divided voices.''
   The language voices strong U.S. support for regional peace
efforts and for diplomatic steps to press Nicaragua's leftist
Sandinista government toward democratic reforms, said Democratic and
Republican sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   It also says that congressional leaders agree, soon after
lawmakers return from their Easter break on April 3, to speedily
bring up legislation extending humanitarian aid to the
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels through Feb. 28, 1990.
   The 11,000 or so rebel troops, now encamped in the Honduran
jungle along the border with Nicaragua, are subsisting on the last
of $27 million in U.S. aid voted by Congress last year. That aid
technically runs out March 31, although supplies ``in the pipeline''
could continue to keep the Contras fed and clothed well into May.
   Democrats were concerned that the statement be consistent with
efforts by the five Central American presidents to engineer a
regional peace agreement. The presidents have agreed on a plan that
calls for disbanding the Contras and relocating them, either back in
Nicaragua or elsewhere.
   ``We don't want to muck up the peace process,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis. ``We have to have better understandings.''
   One congressional source familiar with the talks said two
principal issues still divided the two sides: whether the
reintegration of Contra rebels into Nicraguan society would remain
completely voluntary, and how to deal with the possibility that
Nicaragua might not live up to its democratization pledges a year
from now.
   While calling for steps toward democracy in Nicaragua, the
bipartisan policy statement has been left with a certain
``calculated vagueness,'' according to one participant in the talks,
to make it possible for Democrats and Republicans on opposite sides
of the divisive policy issue to come together and endorse the plan.
   The vagueness also leaves maneuvering room for the administration
to respond to developments in the region which may not be
specifically anticipated in the policy paper, according to several
sources.
   Not included in the statement, but understood to be the
administration's intention, is a secret bill of particulars that
includes a timetable for U.S. rewards and punishments for Nicaragua,
depending on whether the leftist Sandinista government lives up to
promises of democratization.
   Aid to the Contras would continue at a rate of about $4 million a
month under the legislation to be proposed by the administration,
meaning a total aid package of as much as $44 million for 11 months.
The joint statement does not specify the precise amount and duration
of the aid. Rather, the money would be subject to review at certain
points before Nicaragua's national elections, scheduled for February.
   If conditions inside Nicaragua improve enough _ meaning political
freedoms and civil liberties are restored _ some of the aid could be
used to pay for relocating rebel fighters from their camps in
Honduras along the Nicaraguan border and to reintegrate them into
Nicaraguan society.

<HEAD>Senate Fails to Extend AZT Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate failed Friday to extend a program
that provides the drug AZT to victims of AIDS who cannot afford the
costly treatment, which virtually assures the program will expire
March 31.
   A bill sponsored by Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., sought to
redirect $5 million in federal AIDS research funds to the AZT
program for use through September.
   But three senators objected to Kennedy's request that the measure
be acted on without debate or consideration of amendments. The three
critics were not identified.
   Due to the two-week Easter recess, the Senate will not be back in
session for the rest of the month.
   Currently, some 6,000 to 7,000 AIDS victims are receiving AZT
under the program.
   Some states have already run out of money under the program, but
other state have enough to hold them through August. If the program
expires, some 2,875 would be affected by the end of June, according
to the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an AIDS advocacy group.
   Kennedy said the $5 million would provide ``emergency help for
desperate and dying people who deserve access to the few AIDS
treatments that are available.''
   AZT, which has been shown to extend the lives of many AIDS
patients, is the only drug approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for treatment of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.
   ``AZT and a handful of treatments are keeping people alive, and
there is no justification for the Senate's failure to help them,''
Kennedy said. ``But I refuse to abandon a program that costs so
little and means so much.''
   A Kennedy aide said the senator would continue work to extend the
program when the Senate returns in April.
   The current program was an extension of a program begun earlier.
The Senate approved the extension on a voice vote and hours before
it was to expire, the House voted its approval.
   The average cost of AZT is about $600 a month.
   Robert Bray, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign Fund, an
AIDS advocacy group, said that if the program expires, those who
have been receiving their AZT through the program may have to go off
the drug. Some may have to spend down their assets to qualify for
Medicaid in states where the federal health assistance program for
the poor covers AZT, he added.
   He said Georgia and Kansas have already run out of the funds
allocated to them, and Idaho, Kentucky and Utah are expected to run
out at the end of the month.
   ``It can be dealt with when they (members of Congress) come back,
but it's much harder to get a new program started than it is to
continue an existing program,'' Bray said.

   The record-breaking murder rate in the nation's
capital this year prompted two senators to suggest Thursday that the
District of Columbia's police department be replaced with a
federally-controlled police force.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., blamed the city's inability to stem
drug-related killings on ``inept local government that doesn't
understand what it's doing.''
   ``We can't have people killed and blood running on the streets
like some Third World capital,'' Rudman said, noting that three
fatal shootings in the last 24 hours had pushed the city's 1989
murder total to 111. Police later said a fourth man had been killed.
If the killing continues, Rudman said he would consider taking ``a
look at home rule, at least the law enforcement aspect.''
   The senator said he would weigh proposing the creation of a
``federal constabulary'' to replace the city's police department.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., echoed Rudman's sentiments at a
hearing of the Appropriations Committee's state justice
subcommittee, which he chairs. Hollings said he would cosponsor any
legislation Rudman proposed.
   The comments by Rudman and Hollings marked the first time that
lawmakers had raised the possiblity of limiting or curtailing home
rule, a politically sensitive issue among residents and local
politicians of the nation's capital.
   At the hearing, Rudman told FBI Director William Sessions and
Jack Lawn, head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, ``I believe
the FBI and DEA have a very special responsibility to try to help
the local officials, who evidently do not know how'' to deal with
the problem.
   Last year, the district's 372 murders set a record; this year's
total is nearly twice that for the same period a year ago.
   On Monday, William J. Bennett, the Bush administration's drug
policy director, said the federal government should take a more
active role in helping the district control its drug-related crime
spree. He and Mayor Marion Barry Jr. met on Tuesday to begin mapping
out strategies; no firm plans have been released.
   After the hearing, Hollings told reporters, ``We have to get on
top of this. If you had to ask me ... from the crime statistics of
people being killed, home rule is not working.''
   Rudman did not say whether he would favor additional federal
money to assist the city police department.
   ``We would be opposed (to Rudman's idea) unless the Congress is
going to replace police departments in other communities where drugs
have become a threat,'' said John White, a spokesman for Barry.
   Police Chief Maurice T. Turner was not immediately available to
comment.
   The District of Columbia received limited self-governance from
Congress in 1973, but still must have its annual budget and all
legislation reviewed and approved by Congress.
   Under city law, Congress reserves the right to repeal any local
law or act, including part or all of the charter enacted by Congress
for the city.
   Barry, Turner and other city leaders have blamed the upsurge in
murders on the arrival of crack, a highly potent and addictive form
of cocaine. A statistical study of city homicides shows that about
60 percent are drug-related, and about 80 percent of those appear to
be assassinations.

   The nationwide scare over the chemical
additive Alar has finally taken a bite out of Washington state apple
sales, with Friday's shipping report showing a decline of 152,000
boxes from the previous week.
   The weekly report of out-of-state shipments of the nation's
largest apple crop showed a drop from the record 1.56 million boxes
two weeks ago to 1.4 million boxes last week.
   For the same week last year, shipments were 1.5 million boxes,
said Bill DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
Foreign exports also showed a decline of 35,000 boxes, mostly in
canceled shipments to Taiwan, he said.
   Based on the top price quoted Thursday for the top three apple
varieties in Washington, the loss to growers from last week's
decline could be up to $2.4 million. Prices also reportedly are
slipping because of Alar fears.
   ``I'm sure part of this downtrend is the Alar scare,'' said
DeWitt, manager of apple record-keeping organization. ``There is no
doubt in my mind.''
   Sales are also reported down for East Coast apple growers,
although specific figures were not available, said Ralph Baldasaro
of the New York &amp; New England Apple Institute, in Westfield, Mass.
   ``Since Meryl Streep went on TV there has been a definite
slowdown,'' Baldasaro said of the actress' recent vocal opposition
to Alar use. ``There's been no panic, but there is some slowdown.''
   The Washington D.C.-based Natural Resources Defense Council,
whose report raised consumer fears, agreed that the chemical has had
an impact.
   ``Consumers ... have no idea whether the apple they pick up
contains Alar or not,'' said NRDC spokeswoman Jeanne Whalen in a
telephone interview. ``Until they can be sure this is the way
consumers are reacting.''
   Alar is used to keep apples on the trees longer, improving color
and firmness and allowing a longer harvest time.
   U.S. Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., whose family owns apple
orchards, predicted that the federal government's assurances
Thursday that apples are safe to eat will restore consumer
confidence.
   ``The issue has turned,'' Morrison said at a Yakima news
conference.
   Morrison also said he believes Alar will eventually be banned by
the government, and urged Washington growers to voluntarily stop
using it to quiet consumer fears.
   He also criticized the NRDC's ``scare tactics,'' and said the
federal regulatory process is the place to decide which chemicals
are safe to use.
   Alar, the marketing name for daminozide, is still legal to use
although the Environmental Protection Agency has said it will begin
steps to ban it by 1990.
   The downturn in sales figures ended three consecutive weeks of
record shipments.
   DeWitt said there was no way to tell how much of the U.S. drop in
shipments was related to a widespread ban of apple products in
school cafeterias, and how much was a drop in retail sales.
   The apple industry has disputed the NRDC findings, and also
maintained that only about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the
chemical.
   Ironically, however, another scare over Chilean fruit is helping
sales of Washington Granny Smith apples, with prices jumping about
$3 to $25 per box, the federal-state Market News Service reported.
   Chile is a major supplier of Granny Smiths, but they were removed
from markets for five days this week following the discovery of two
cyanide-laced grapes.

   The Sandinista government on Friday
pardoned and freed 1,894 former national guardsmen in partial
fulfillment of a Central American peace agreement.
   Hours later, in the capital, Managua, President Daniel Ortega
announced electoral and other reforms and said measures point to his
leftist government's commitment to end strife in the region.
   Ortega appealed to the U.S. Congress not to renew humanitarian
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, beyond 90 days
because it would go against the desire of the Central American
presidents to dismantle the force.
   Many of the prisoners freed on Friday had been under detention
since President Anastasio Somoza's right-wing regime, defended by
the national guard, was toppled in June-July 1979 in a civil war led
by the Sandinistas.
   Some Nicaraguans opposed freeing the prisoners. They said their
relatives and friends were victims of repression and torture by the
national guard during the years of Somoza family rule.
   The president said the guardsmen should be permitted to rejoin
society, but he also said any who ``return to their criminal
activities'' would face ``the popular ire with all its force.''
   Ortega asked the National Assembly to grant the pardons in line
with his pledge to adopt democratic reforms as part of an accord
with four other Central American presidents.
   The assembly denied pardons to 39 former guardsman because of the
severity of their ``crimes against the people.''
   Of the 1,894 guardsmen granted pardons Wednesday by the assembly,
1,643 were at the La Modelo prison in Tipitapa, 14 miles from
Managua, and the remaining 251 had been under house arrest, said
Marcos Arevalo, deputy commander of the penal system.
   At Tipitapa the prisoners stood in the dusty prison yard as their
names were read. Then they yelled out the names of their loved ones
and joined waiting relatives in a happy throng.
   ``I give thanks to God. I never thought they would let him out
this soon,'' said a teary-eyed Francis Montano, 26, who greeted her
freed father, 55-year-old Francisco Montano.
   Ortega was present at the ceremony but did not speak. Also
present were Joao Baena Soares, secretary-general of the
Organization of American States; Roman Catholic Bishop Bosco Vivas
of Managua and some foreign diplomats and opposition politicians.
   During the release ceremony, which lasted for about 30 minutes,
the names of the prisoners were announced over a loudspeaker. They
walked to several desks where army officers and representatives of
the OAS human rights commission gave them safe-conduct passes.
   At the back of the prison yard the International Red Cross
distributed packages of food. The Red Cross also provided 50 buses
to take the freed men and their relatives home and said it had plans
to provide them with food for two months.
   Ms. Montano said her father was a sergeant working as a typist
when he was captured by Sandinista guerrillas in June 1979.
   ``They arrested him for being a military man for 26 years,'' she
said. ``Nobody has ever accused him of anything.'' She said her
father had been given a 22-year sentence.
   Ms. Montano said her father would live with her and her husband,
who three months ago began serving a mandatory two-year period of
military service with the army as a medic. Over the past three years
authorities had allowed her father to stay with the family some
weekends, she said.
   Some prisoners were defiant.
   ``We held up for 10 years and we can take some more,'' said
Sobeida MacRea Jarquin, 41, convicted of spying for the Somoza
security agency and the CIA.
   ``After seven official interrogations and two years in solitary
they never proved anything against me,'' she said.
   Ms. MacRea and her husband, national guard Lt. Humberto Zuniga,
were arrested on July 28, 1979. They were released Friday and were
met by Ms. MacRea's sisters.
   Asked about her plans, Ms. MacRea said: ``We'll probably spend
Easter week at the beach. Then we'll think about our situation.''

   President Daniel Ortega announced
electoral and other reforms on Friday and said the measures point to
his leftist Sandinista government's commitment to bring peace to
Central America.
   Hours earlier, the Sandinistas freed 1,894 former national
guardsmen from prison.
   Ortega appealed to the U.S. Congress not to renew humanitarian
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras, beyond 90 days
because it would go against the desire of the region's presidents to
dismantle the U.S.-backed force.
   ``We appeal to the government of the United States, President
George Bush and the U.S. Congress so that what is being discussed
today in Congress regarding renewed aid to the Contras will be
contemplated within the framework of the joint declaration of the
Central American presidents,'' Ortega said in a speech before
opposition party leaders and the archbishop of Managua, Cardinal
Miguel Obando y Bravo.
   Ortega was refering to an accord he and the presidents of El
Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica signed on Feb. 14 in El
Salvador. The five agreed to draft a plan by mid-May to dismantle
the Contras, most of whom are in jungle camps in Honduras near the
Nicaraguan border.
   In the pact, Ortega promised legal reforms to guarantee fair
general elections, which he moved up by 10 months, to Feb. 25, 1990.
   Government sources in Washington and Contra leaders have said the
Bush administration will ask Congress for up to $50 million in new,
non-lethal aid for the Contras. The current package of $27 million
expires March 31.
   Ortega said talks he has been holding with his political foes
have been ``positive ... frank and constructive'' but that the El
Salvador accord did not oblige his government to hold negotiations
with the opposition.
   ``Rather, the Nicaraguan government assumes the responsibility of
enacting certain reforms,'' Ortega said.
   He announced 20 reforms he said his government will send to the
National Assembly within the next few days, including:
   _Allowing exiled Nicaraguans to vote from abroad. Thousands of
Nicaraguans have fled eight years of civil war and a dismal economy.
   _Forbidding use of state resources or employees in the campaign;
   _Changing laws on financing political parties;
   _Reducing the number of regional polling and vote-counting
stations;
   _Making the Supreme Electoral Council more representative of
opposition parties.
   Passage is virtually assured. The Sandinistas dominate the
96-member National Assembly, with 61 deputies to the opposition's 35.
   Hundreds of former members of ousted President Anastasio Somoza's
national guard were released earlier Friday at La Modelo prison in
Tipitapa village just outside Managua.
   Most were jailed in the months following the July 19, 1979, rise
to power of the Sandinistas, who defeated Somoza in a popular
uprising.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Friday the
new peace plan he will present in Washington next month will not
include giving up land to the Palestinians, setting him on a
possible collision course with the Bush administration.
   In the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, six Palestinians were
shot and wounded in clashes with Israeli troops Friday.
   Shamir said he would not talk to the Palestine Liberation
Organization and his peace proposals would not be based on a
territorial compromise, according to an interview with the daily
Haaretz published Friday.
   U.S. Middle East policy long has been based on the idea of Israel
giving up occupied land for peace, and U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker III suggested this week in Washington that Israel may have no
choice but to talk to the PLO.
   ``In everything I will present, there is no territorial element.
I don't think any kind of territorial combination can help in
achieving peace or quelling the (Israeli-Arab) conflict,'' Shamir
was quoted as saying.
   Shamir said he would propose a step-by-step solution for the
occupied lands when he meets President Bush next month, according to
the interview.
   He did not elaborate, but mentioned ``stages that can satisfy to
a great extent some of the aspirations of the Arabs who live with
us, without endangering Israel's security,'' Haaretz reported.
   In the past, Shamir has proposed limited Palestinian autonomy
leading to an unspecified final settlement. Palestinian leaders and
the PLO have rejected the proposal, insisting on the creation of an
independent Palestinian state.
   An 18-year-old Palestinian guerrilla who was caught after
infiltrating into Israel from Egypt meanwhile said on Israel TV
Friday he was operating on orders from Yasser Arafat's Fatah wing of
the PLO.
   Iman Mohammed Hassan Yunis was one of the two guerrillas captured
on Wednesday near the border town of Rafah in the Gaza Strip after
they threw a hand grenade at an army camp. No Israeli casualties
resulted.
   It was the first attempted infiltration attributed to Fatah since
Arafat in December renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right
to exist. Following Arafat's statements, the United States opened a
dialogue with the PLO.
   The U.S. administration demands that Israel show greater
flexibility in view of the 15-month Palestinian revolt in the
occupied lands, which Israel captured almost 22 years ago from
Jordan and Egypt. The uprising has killed at least 396 Palestinians
and 17 Israelis.
   In the Gaza Strip Friday, four Palestinians aged 18 to 25 were
shot and wounded in scattered stone-throwing clashes with troops,
hospital officials said. A 19-year-old Palestinian was shot and
wounded in the West Bank village of Yabad and a 15-year-old was shot
in the leg in Nablus, Arab doctors said.
   In other developments:
   _An Israeli army spokesman said two soldiers were wounded in a
gunfight Friday with guerrillas who apparently crossed into Israel
from Jordan. But knowledgeable Israeli sources said one soldier was
killed and another wounded in the 10 p.m. attack. The sources said
on condition of anonymity that it was believed the guerrillas
crossed the border back into Jordan. There was no report of
guerrilla casualties.
   The army spokesman said an initial report indicated the
guerrillas had entered Israel near the communal farm of Ein Yahav,
74 miles south of Jerusalem.
   _Arsonists attacked Jerusalem homes of a journalist and a
relative of a left-wing legislator on Thursday night, and police
blamed a right-wing underground group named The Sicarites after
ancient Jewish assassins. No one was hurt.
   _In the southern tent prison of Ketziot, a Palestinian identified
as Mohammed Razi Jamal Dula was found dead Friday, and an
investigation showed he was killed by fellow inmates, the army
command said. It said later that troops seized a suspect in the
murder, who apparently acted out of criminal motives.
   _Supreme Court Judge Aharon Barak ordered the defense and police
ministries to answer a petition by family members of Mahmoud Yusef
Al Masri, a Palestinian prisoner who died in an interrogation room
at Gaza prison two weeks ago. Police blamed a ruptured ulcer.
Israeli media reports said the family claims Al Masri was beaten to
death.
   _Israeli Foreign Minister Moshe Arens met Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar at U.N. headquarters in New York on Friday
to discuss the peace process, the occupied territories, and clashes
in Lebanon between Israeli troops and U.N. peacekeepers.

   A woman whose brother and brother-in-law
were believed killed by the Mafia withdrew from a lawsuit against
mob bosses Thursday, saying she and her five children received death
threats.
   Michela Buscemi had joined a civil lawsuit against Mafia bosses
who were convicted in December 1987 in Italy's largest trial against
the mob. But she told a court hearing the appeal of the trial that
she feared for her family and was reluctantly withdrawing from the
suit.
   Although the bodies of her brother and brother-in-law, who
disappeared in 1982, were never found, their deaths were treated as
homicides and they were among the murders that brought convictions
during the mass trial.
   Mrs. Buscemi told the court Thursday that hardly any customers
come to the bar she and her husband run because she dared to join
the lawsuit.
   ``I was abandoned by relatives, friends, the state,'' she told
reporters after the court session. Relatives of victims like Mrs.
Buscemi have complained that the state does not adequately protect
them when they challenge the Mafia.

   A Continental Airlines jetliner over the
Sierra Nevada shuddered for several minutes with severe vibrations
Friday, forcing an emergency landing that revealed part of the tail
section was scorched.
   The crew of the Boeing 737 with 69 people aboard made a normal
landing at San Francisco International Airport about 1 p.m. and
taxied to a gate on its own, officials said. There were no injuries
reported.
   After the plane landed, a scorched area about 10 feet in diameter
was discovered on the tail. There also appeared to be damage to the
stabilizer, the horizontal portion of the tail that helps control
the plane's attitude.
   Dave Messing, a Continental spokesman in Houston said it was
believed that the problem was in the plane's auxiliary power unit,
or APU. ``There was an APU malfunction, possibly resulting in an
overheating condition,'' he said.
   An aviation source who had a chance to inspect the plane said a
fire had damaged the stabilizer on the tail section near the APU,
but he said the power unit itself was not charred.
   ``It (the stabilizer) is burned on the outside. The paint is
burned off. But they don't know how it occurred,'' said the source,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said the only possible
source of ignition in the charred area appeared to be one of the
plane's strobe lights.
   R.E. ``Griff'' Greffenius, a business traveler from Walnut Creek,
Calif., said after he got off the plane, he noticed a large part of
the tail section appeared to be burned.
   During the flight, the vibrations were severe and lasted several
minutes, Greffenius said. They were followed by several minutes of
silence, he said.
   ``Then the pilot came on and said, `Obviously, we're having a
vibration problem and we're going back to Oakland,''' said
Greffenius.
   There was ``obvious damage to the tail,'' Greffenius said. ``The
paint in a fairly large area of the tail section appears to be
scorched.''
   Ron Wilson, a spokesman for San Francisco International Airport,
said he heard the pilot during the landing and was unaware the
incident was as serious as Greffenius described.
   Wilson said he watched the aircraft land and hadn't noticed any
serious problems. ``The pilot reported vibrations. He made a normal
landing,'' he said. The Sierra Nevada is about 200 miles east of the
San Francisco Bay area. The plane had been bound for Denver.

<HEAD>Forty-Nine `Instigators' Sent Out Of Detention Center After Disturbance</HEAD>

   Forty-nine aliens suspected of spurring at
least 200 of their fellow detainees to rush the fence at an
immigration detention center have been moved to other border
lockups, an official said Friday.
   ``It was felt that they were the instigators,'' said Duke Austin,
a spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service. He said
40 people went to the Webb County Jail in Laredo and nine to Starr
County Jail in Rio Grande City.
   A disturbance broke out at the 315-acre, minimum-security center
for aliens facing deportation about 2:45 p.m. Thursday. About 200
men threw rocks and ripped up a section of fence, but did not try to
escape, officials said.
   An INS riot squad quickly assembled and brought the situation
under control, said officials and immigration attorneys who
witnessed the demonstration at the Port Isabel Service Processing
Center.
   The rural camp is just south of the Laguna Atascosa National
Wildlife Refuge and about 20 miles northeast of the border city of
Brownsville.
   INS officials don't know why the disturbance began, Austin said,
but he speculated that it probably was the result of frustration of
detention.
   He said the center was calm Friday. Extra guards sealing off the
main entrance and exit Thursday were gone Friday.
   Brownsville immigration attorney Linda Yanez, who was at the
center interviewing clients when the demonstration broke out, said
the incident was inevitable.
   ``These people do not have any sense of what their legal rights
are, what their situation is,'' Ms. Yanez said. ``They don't have
any telephones.''
   All 1,600 people at the recreation area rushed the fence, but did
not try to escape, she said.
   ``Of course people are going to be tense when they are held
incommunicado and families are split up,'' she said.
   Representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees also were present for a regular observation visit Thursday
when the INS cleared all visitors and civilian personnel from the
camp. The UN officials declined comment on the incident.
   The center held 2,279 men and women Friday, primarily Central
Americans, including 754 men sleeping in tents.
   Its population has increased by 500 percent since Feb. 21, when
the INS started immediate detention of immigrants whose initial
applications for political asylum are denied in South Texas.
   Stepped up Border Patrol enforcement and a curtailment of
recognizance releases of those apprehended also have swelled the
number of detainees. Most aliens are held at the center in lieu of
deportation bonds of up to $4,000.
   The INS' position is that most of the Nicaraguans, El
Salvadorans, Guatemalans and Hondurans entering southern Texas do
not qualify as political refugees because they are here for economic
reasons.
   Asylum is granted to those able to convince the U.S. Justice and
State departments that they are fleeing persecution.
   He said attorneys' allegations of shortages of food and medical
care at the center were untrue. The U.S. Public Health Service
provides doctors, physicians and nurses to attend to the detainees,
Austin said.
   A water shortage, however, makes it impossible for every detainee
to bathe daily, Austin said.

   A sweeping anti-smog plan approved Friday
by Southern California officials would clamp new restrictions on
everyone from managers of heavy industry to backyard barbecue chefs.
   The plan, intended to clean air in the four-county Los Angeles
basin up to federal standards by 2007, would phase in strict rules
requiring use of such clean-burning fuels as methanol and compressed
natural gas in cars, trucks and buses.
   The changes also attack a variety of large and small pollution
sources, from industrial paints and solvents to such household
chemicals as charcoal lighter fluid and underarm deodorant aerosols.
   The plan, prepared in response to pressure from the federal
government, was approved 10-2 by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District and 16-1 by the Southern California Association
of Governments. Both are regional planning agencies.
   The votes capped a contentious, eight-hour session which drew
about 200 people from environmental and citizens' groups, industry
and government. The proposals had been closely watched across the
nation by industry and pollution-shrouded cities.
   ``Let's proceed under a yellow light,'' said Bill Welsh of the
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. ``Let's proceed with caution and
weigh this plan carefully.''
   Labor representatives generally opposed tight restrictions on
industrial pollutants, which they said could shutter factories at a
cost of thousands of jobs.
   ``I've heard politician after politician stand up and say, `We
all have to sacrifice,'' said Ron Sandes, a member of the Oil,
Chemical and Atomic Workers union employed at the Chevron refinery
in El Segundo. ``I don't know what you are sacrificing, but I am
sacrificing my job.''
   The district estimates the changes would cost $3.9 billion a
year, but an industry study by National Economic Research
Associates, Inc. found the probable cost was $12.8 billion a year,
or $2,200 a year added to the annual cost of goods and services for
each Southern California household.
   The plan now must be accepted by the state Air Resources Board
and the federal Environmental Protection Agency, which has
threatened to take over smog control if local authorities fail to
act. The first provisions of the three-tiered plan, however, could
go into effect within a year.
   The plan's 160 proposed rules would reach into unexpected corners
of everyday life to attack smog sources both large and small:
   _ People would be forced within the next five years to swap
aerosol deodorant sprays for manual-pump sprays or stick deodorants.
Hair spray, too, along with other household aerosols using volatile
chemicals that form smog, also would be banned.
   _ The suburban backyard scene would change forever with bans on
charcoal lighter fluid for barbecues and requirements that
lawnmowers and other tools run on either electricity or fuel that
burns more cleanly than gasoline.
   _ Drive-through burger stands might be limited to cut down on
smog-generating engine idling while motorists wait for their orders.
   _ Motorists would have to shell out more for tires because
radials, rather than bias-ply, tires would be required on cars and
light trucks. That's because radials last longer, and thus throw off
fewer of the minute flecks of rubber that contribute to particulate
pollutants. In car-crazy Southern California, where more than 12
million people drive 8 million vehicles about 234 million miles a
day, that alone would cut particulate pollutants by 3.1 tons a day,
the authors of the plan said.
   The bulk of the pollution reductions would be achieved by larger
scale assaults on smog sources.
   State-required checks of auto pollution-control equipment would
be more stringent, and new emission limits would be imposed on
diesel trucks and buses.
   Owners of fleets of 15 vehicles or more, be they governments or
businesses, would have to switch to cleaner-burning fuels beginning
in 1992.
   The plan's goal is to have such clean-burning fuels as compressed
natural gas and methane in wide use. By 1998, the goal is to have
such fuels in 40 percent of cars and light- or medium-duty trucks,
70 percent of freight trucks and 100 percent of buses.
   The plan would cover a district of 13,350 square miles, covering
Los Angeles, Orange, and parts of Riverside and San Bernardino
counties.

   A federal judge gave Apple Computer Inc. an
important victory Friday in its legal battle with fellow computer
giants Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard over the visual displays for
Apple's Macintosh system.
   U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer's tentative ruling held
that a 1985 Apple-Microsoft licensing agreement did not entitle
Microsoft to produe a display program called Windows 2.03, the
target of the copyright lawsuit.
   ``Windows 2.03, the product as it is now being offered, is not
covered by the license,'' Schwarzer said.
   That means Microsoft cannot claim permission from Apple to market
a program with visual displays similar to those in the Macintosh,
Apple's biggest-selling model. But the case is far from over.
   Apple still must prove that Windows 2.03 is ``substantially
similar'' to the Macintosh menu screen graphics, distinctive for
their use of ``icons'' _ pictoral symbols such as file drawers and
wastebaskets _ rather than written commands, to enter and use the
computer system.
   Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which uses the Windows display for
a computer program called New Wave, contend that Apple's own program
was not original but was derived from other companies' works.
   They also argue that the graphics Apple is trying to protect are
no more than basic ideas, like the use of office equipment as
symbols. Ideas cannot be copyrighted, only expressions of ideas;
courts have also refused copyright protection when an idea can be
expressed in only one way.
   A verdict that gave broad protections to Apple's
``user-friendly'' displays could keep Microsoft's program, which is
compatible with International Business Machines equipment, off IBM
computers and could slow the development of software for systems
like Windows and New Wave.
   Friday's ruling knocked out Microsoft's first line of defense
against the lawsuit: that the 1985 licensing agreement with Apple,
allowing an early version of the display program called Windows 1.0,
was broad enough to cover a later version such as Windows 2.03.
   Schwarzer said his ruling was narrow and did not necessarily mean
that any particular icons could not be duplicated.
   The judge did not decide, however, whether Microsoft had the
right to duplicate icons that were contained in the earlier Windows
1.0 as well as Windows 2.03.
   Schwarzer also expressed no view on Apple's argument that a
program with the same ``look and feel'' as the Macintosh display
would violate the copyright. That issue may be resolved when the
case goes to trial.

   Strikebound Eastern Airlines has notified aircraft brokers it
wants to sell part of its 250-plane fleet as its owners and
Machinists union hint that talks are under way to sell the carrier,
now reorganizing in bankruptcy court.
   ``We're exploring the market,'' Eastern spokesman Robin Matell
told The Associated Press on Friday. He added that he did not know
the total number of aircraft for sale, but that it was ``nowhere
near most of the fleet.''
   The notice to aircraft brokers worldwide was issued either
Thursday or Friday and included listings of DC-9s, Boeing 727s and
757s, Matell said. He said that the airline made similar notices
``hundreds'' of times in the past.
   ``Given the current situation it obviously draws much greater
attention and people wonder just what it means,'' Matell said,
noting that the company had made it clear since the Machinists
struck the carrier nearly two weeks ago that assets would be sold to
finance Eastern's rebuilding.
   ``There is nothing unusual'' about the company's latest attempt
to sell aircraft, Matell insisted.
   Eastern's pilots, who joined with flight attendants in sympathy
strikes against the carrier, have maintained that Eastern's parent
company is stripping the company's assets to prop up non-union
sister Continental Airlines.
   In another development Friday, a Pan Am Corp. union official said
he would meet with the leader of Eastern's striking Machinists in
Miami to discuss a possible joint employee buyout of the two
airlines.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, told The Associated Press that he and Machinists District
100 President Charles Bryan plan to discuss a buyout plan Saturday
to combine the airlines.
   Pan Am, like Eastern, has been racked by financial losses and
labor tensions. Pan Am Chairman Tom Plaskett recently said the
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure
its survival.
   Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo has indicated a renewed
interest in selling all or parts of Eastern since the airline filed
for bankruptcy protection March 9. Eastern is operating only about
10 percent of its pre-strike schedule of 1,040 daily flights.
   ``It's possible that the most sensible way for Eastern Airlines
to proceed would be for some different types of ownership in some
way,'' Lorenzo said in an interview recorded for ABC-TV's ``20-20''
show Friday night.
   But Lorenzo promised that his goal hasn't been to sell off
Eastern.
   Bryan, the union chief who for years has advocated employee
control as a leading solution for Eastern's problems, confirmed he
would meet with Genoese but declined to say whether they would
explore an Eastern-Pan Am combination.
   ``We're going to be discussing a whole range of subjects,'' the
Machinists leader said, adding, ``I never make any statements about
any possible sales or transactions.''
   Financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for Eastern
remains financier Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc. Bryan has talked to Icahn several times in the past
year about buying Eastern.
   Meanwhile, attorneys for Eastern pilots on Friday promised to
protest to a bankruptcy judge about the apparent transfer of Eastern
landing slots to sister carrier Continental on the eve of the
bankruptcy filing.
   Other documents obtained by the attorneys indicated Eastern also
gained federal approval for transfer of other slots to rivals Pan Am
and United Airlines just before the strike began two weeks ago.
   ``We think these transactions just strengthen the employees'
position that a trustee should be appointed (by the bankruptcy
court) to oust the present management, which has been doing this for
years,'' said James Linsey, a New York attorney for the Air Line
Pilots Association.
   The unions contend that Lorenzo has systematically sold off
Eastern assets or transferred them to predominantly nonunion
Continental at cut-rate prices.
   The pilots' attorneys say they believe the transfers of eight
landing slots at New York's La Guardia Airport and eight at
Washington's National Airport to Continental are permanent, although
Continental spokesman Art Kent said they were 60-day leases. No
details were made public on the amount of money involved.
   Continental has been advertising new flights between Miami and La
Guardia and Washington on Miami radio stations.
   Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock said the deals for the slot
transfers, which are effective in April, were made last October.
   ``These two things just don't relate to the strike or bankruptcy.
They were made before we knew that was going to happen,'' Ashlock
said.
   Ashlock said the transfers of six Pan Am slots at New York's
Kennedy Airport are temporary and only for summer, which is Pan Am's
peak travel season. The transfers of six Chicago slots to United are
permanent. He didn't have details on the amounts of money involved.
   Bryan indicated union attorneys will challenge all recent assets
transfers and sales before the bankruptcy court, including deals
made before the strike and bankruptcy filing.
   The strike began March 4 with a walkout by 8,500 Machinists
mechanics and ground service workers in a dispute over $125 million
in proposed wage cuts. The strike quickly escalated with the support
of pilots and flight attendants. Five days later, Eastern filed for
bankruptcy reorganization.

   Gunmen killed a 42-year-old
Roman Catholic man in front of his wife Friday night, police said,
in the latest in an apparent series of retaliatory sectarian
killings.
   Police said the killers smashed their way into the man's home in
Glengormley, on the outskirts of Belfast, and shot him.
   No group immediately claimed responsibility for the Friday night
murder of the Catholic man police identified as 42-year-old civil
servant Niall Davies, the father of two daughters.
   Davies' his 11-year-old daughter was in the house at the time of
the shooting. His other daughter, age 18, was at St. Patrick's Day
celebrations when she heard of her father's death, police said.
   Earlier Friday a bomb exploded near a joint army and police foot
patrol in mainly Catholic west Belfast but no one was injured, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary said. The patrol had been moving into
position to guard the St. Patrick's Day parade in the Falls Road.
   On Thursday, the outlawed, mainly Roman Catholic Irish Republican
Army killed Jackie Irvine, 50, the Protestant owner of a Belfast
grocery store, and warned of more shootings to come.
   The IRA's Belfast Brigade claimed on Friday that Irvine belonged
to an outlawed Protestant paramilitary group and that there were
clear indications he was involved in recent murders of Catholics. It
did not identify the group.
   A Belfast police statement said Irvine was shot as he ran out the
front door of his home in north Belfast when at least two gunmen
tried to break in from the rear.
   Neighbors said they heard as many as eight shots and then saw a
car race from the scene.
   Press Association said Irvine was a former member of the
so-called brigade staff of the Ulster Volunteer Force, an outlawed
Protestant paramilitary group.
   It said the group was allegedly involved in shootings of members
of Sinn Fein, the legal political arm of the IRA, and others.
   Northern Ireland suffers periodic retaliatory sectarian attacks
on victims from either side of the Protestant-Catholic divide.
   The latest round began Feb. 12 when gunmen stormed the home of
Catholic lawyer PatrickFinucane in north Belfast and killed him.
Finucane had acted for clients allegedly involved in the IRA's fight
against British rule in Northern Ireland.
   An outlawed Protestant paramilitary group, the Ulster Freedom
Fighters, claimed responsibility, saying he was an IRA officer. His
widow denied it.
   The IRA wants to unite predominantly Protestant Northern Ireland
with the 95 percent Catholic Republic of Ireland under socialist
rule.
   On Feb. 14, gunmen killed Sinn Fein councilman John Davey as he
drove to his home in Glenduff village, 30 miles northwest of
Belfast. No group claimed responsibility.
   On Feb. 16, gunmen burst into a Protestant bar in Belfast and
wounded five people. The Irish National Liberation Army, a Marxist
offshoot of the IRA, claimed responsibility.
   On March 8, IRA gunmen killed three Protestants outside a gas
station.
   On March 10, gunmen killed one man leaving a Catholic bar in west
Belfast and wounded another.

<TEXT>
   U.S.-born John Hull,
accused as a drug runner and a man who violated Costa Rica's
neutrality in Central American conflicts, said Friday this country
is persecuting him for political motives.
   Hull, 69, a Costa Rican citizen and rancher born in Evansville,
Ind., spoke to reporters for the first time since Costa Rican
brought charges against him two months ago.
   He said the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Central
Intelligence Agency and U.S. congressional committees all have
cleared him of wrongdoing after investigations.
   ``I'll repeat that this case is no more than a political-economic
plot against me,'' Hull declared. He said Costa Rica was embarrassed
by revelations in the Iran-Contra scandal that some Contra supplies
went through Costa Rica and is prosecuting him as a scapegoat.
   On Jan. 13, Hull was charged with allowing a runway on his ranch
near the Nicaraguan border to be used for shipping drugs to the
United States, the money to be used to buy arms for the U.S.-backed
Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras.
   He spent two months in jail before being freed on $37,500 bond
because of poor health following a heart attack.
   At his ranch is a 1,800-foot strip where, the government alleges,
drug-laden planes left for Miami.
   Hull's lawyer, Juan Jose Sobrado, who appeared with him Friday,
said planes carrying drugs need a bigger runway and that the
government confused the Hull ranch with another landing strip nearby.
   ``Surely (George) Morales confused Hull's landing strip with that
of Llano Grande, four kilometers (2{ miles) to the north where
larger planes can land or take off, where the runway is 8,000 feet
long,'' Sobrado said.
   Testimony before the U.S. Congress said small planes used Hull's
landing strip for drug runs.
   ``To carry cargos of 25,000 pounds of marijuana and 1,000 kilos
(2,200 pounds) of cocaine, planes like Cessna 404 and 402 are
needed, which require runways at least 8,000 feet long and the
runway on the Hull ranch is only 1,800 feet,'' the lawyer said.
   Sobrado said Costa Rican authorities based their accusations
against Hull on statements Colombian drug trafficker George Morales
made in an interview on CBS.
   Hull himself cited an article published in July 1987 in The New
York Times which he said called accusations against him ``political
fantasies.''
   He displayed the charges drawn against him by Costa Rican
authorities which concluded, ``There is no assurance that drugs have
left from John Hull's landing strip.''
   ``Despite this conclusion, they have accused and jailed me
unjustly in a case typical of political persecution,'' Hull said.
``The only thing I did was provide humanitarian aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels that consisted of clothing, medicine and food
between 1984 and 1985 ... this was known by the then-president, Luis
Alberto Monge, the minister of security and the rural police, and
this was public knowledge.''
   The man who is Costa Rica's president now, Oscar Arias, won the
1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts toward ending Central
American conflicts in which Costa Rican policy is officially neutral.
   Hull said that because of financial difficulties he has had to
reduce the help on his ranch _ about 60 miles north of San Jose and
30 miles from the Nicaraguan border _ from 100 to 70 people.
   Hull cultivates oranges, pineapples, nuts and other fruits for
export.
   ``The harvest has dropped considerably because the banks have
denied me credit for two years and exports have dropped,'' Hull said.
   He said if Costa Rican authorities give permission, he will go to
the United States for a medical examination to see if he needs heart
surgery.
   Sobrando complained the government has interfered with his
telephone service since taking up the Hull case, but the lawyer said
that otherwise he has not been pressured.

<TEXT>
   The government and the country's main
guerrilla group signed an accord Friday to begin talks April 1
toward permanently ending their 16-year-old insurgency.
   President Virgilio Barco, in a nationwide television address
Friday night, called on the country's other leftist guerrilla groups
to follow suit.
   The accord was signed in the mountain town of Santo Domingo, 180
miles south of Bogota, by the minister of interior, Raul Orejuela
Bueno, and Carlos Pizarro, commander of the M-19, or the April 19
Movement.
   A joint declaration said four meetings that led to the accord
were held in Colombia and Mexico after the leftist guerrillas
declared a unilateral cease-fire eight months ago.
   The declaration said both sides agreed on talks beginning April 1
that would ``lead to full democracy'' and reintegrate the insurgents
into society.
   The talks are to finish before legislative elections set for
March 1990, in which M-19 probably will participate as a legal
political party, officials said.
   The agreement did not say when the guerrillas would have to give
up their arms.
   Barco said the accord ``opens a time of hope for the fate of the
country,'' but he said there large obstacles to overcome before
attaining peace.
   The president called on other guerrilla groups fighting the
government for more than 20 years to join M-19 in the peace talks.
   An estimated 10,000 leftist guerrillas operate in Colombia. They
are blamed for more than 2,000 deaths and nearly 500 kidnappings in
1988 alone.
   ``I urge all guerrillas to integrate themselves in civilian life.
The road is always open,'' Barco said.
   He signaled that the government is ready to begin talks with the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, a communist rebel group that
declared a unilateral cease-fire Feb. 28 in an effort to join the
peace process.
   However, Barco said the cease-fire must hold for a certain period
of time to determine if the FARC has ``a genuine spirit of
reconciliation.''
   The joint declaration also said the guerrillas will no longer
operate underground and will base themselves in Santo Domingo, where
they receive state protection and will not be subject to harassment
by the army.
   During the signing ceremony, Orejuela said all sides must stay
vigilant because ``there are people interested in seeing that a
process like this one fails.''
   The declaration said 13 guerrilla delegates who had no criminal
record participated in the talks and had government protection.
   The April 19 Movement takes its name from a 1970 presidential
election that the guerrillas say was fraudulent.
   Once the nation's most notorious group, M-19's bloodiest
operation was seizing the Supreme Court building in Bogota in 1985.
The army retook the building, but 11 Supreme Court justices and 85
other people were killed.

<HEAD>Committee: Missile Downed Italian Jetliner, But Origin Unknown</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Technical experts concluded Friday that a missile
caused the crash of an Italian airliner in 1980, but they failed to
determine who fired it.
   All 81 people aboard the Itavia DC-9 perished when the plane
plunged into the Tyrrhenian Sea on June 27, 1980, during a flight
from Bologna to Palermo, Sicily.
   The six experts said in a 477-page report that the disaster was
caused by a missile exploding in the rear section of the plane.
   An airplane near the DC-9 at the time of the incident may have
been involved in the disaster, the report said, but added it was not
possible to identify the second plane or tell whether it was an
aggressor or also a target.
   ``At this point, we lack sufficient elements to determine the
type, the starting-point and the identity of the missile'' that
downed the plane, the experts said in their report.
   The six specialists had been appointed in 1986 by Rome Magistrate
Vittorio Bucarelli, who is investigating the case.
   Italy's minister of defense, Valerio Zanone, ordered the air
force to study the report.

   One gun dealer said he could have ``sold a trailer load'' of
semiautomatic assault rifles and others sold the weapons at twice
the normal price following a ban on imports and an American
company's decision to stop selling them.
   ``It's hysteria running wild,'' said Donald G. Davis, owner of
Don's Guns, a chain of three stores in Indianapolis. ``We could
hardly give one away prior to this mass hysteria, and now every
other customer that comes in here wants (one).''
   Dealers said the run on guns has been limited to the rapid-fire
assault weapons, and the buyers are not only gun enthusiasts worried
the stock soon would be depleted. Many who bought semiautomatics
Thursday were labeled by dealers as investors.

   Journalist Terry Anderson, in his fifth year as a prisoner of the
politics he once reported, is ``tired of being caged like an
animal,'' his sister said.
   ``Enough is enough. ... This cannot continue,'' Peggy Say said
Thursday at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., attended by members of
Congress, Anderson's colleagues and relatives of the hostages in
Beirut, Lebanon.
   The ceremony marked the four years Anderson, the chief Middle
East correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held captive
and was one of many observances across the country. The anniversary
also included a congressional resolution calling for release of all
te hostages and a statement from President Bush expressing his
sympathy. Anderson, 41, the longest held of the American hostages,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut by a group believed to be
made up of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran.

   In a bold move aimed at increasing Soviet food
supplies, Communist Party leaders have embraced the concept of the
family farm to allow citizens to lease land for life and pass it on
to their heirs.
   The policy-setting Central Committee also approved measures to
improve the quality of food eaten by the average Soviet, who
consumes only about half as much meat and fruit as the typical
American but much more sugar and potatoes.
   The committee ended a two-day session Thursday by adopting a
long-awaited agricultural reform package that it says will eliminate
most food shortages by 1996. ``We are not promising something that
we cannot achieve, but we assure that we will be able to change the
food situation for the better,'' Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev
told a news conference.

   The Times of London reported today that police know
who bombed Flight 103, the Pan Am jumbo jet that blew up over
Scotland in December and killed 270 people.
   While the respected newspaper quoted unidentified government
sources for its report, there was no confirmation today from
authorities.
   Meanwhile, British and West German authorities dismissed a report
in a British tabloid today that said a suspect belonging to a
radical Palestinian group had been taken into custody in Europe. The
newspaper reports followed revelations that British authorities had
issued warnings before the attack about the type of bomb that downed
Flight 103 on Dec. 21. However, Pan Am said the only notification it
received from British authorities arrived by mail weeks after the
disaster.

   With a record murder rate and its two top local
officials under federal investigation, the nation's capital has had
its share of unwanted publicity lately. Now, senators have begun
talking openly about what local politicians fear most _ the
possibility that Congress will take control of city government.
   Citing the city's inability to stem drug-related killings, two
senators suggested Thursday that the District of Columbia's police
department be replaced with a federally controlled police force.
   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., blamed the city's crime wave on
``inept local government that doesn't understand what it's doing.''

   Residents of Southern California would have to
change how they paint their houses, light their barbecues and spray
their hair under a plan devised to clean up the nation's worst air.
   The changes are outlined in a comprehensive blueprint intended to
enable the metropolitan area to comply with federal clean air
standards by the year 2007.
   The Air Quality Management Plan, expected to be approved today,
is likely to touch nearly every aspect of Southern California life
for the next 18 years, said A. Norton Younglove, a Riverside County
supervisor and chairman of the South Coast Regional Air Quality
Management District's governing board.

<HEAD>Acclaimed Spy Thriller Series Brings an Actor Into his Own</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: No comma in `Game Set and Match'</HEAD>

   His cameo roles in movies are often jewels, but Ian
Holm's latest TV assignment offers something more _ the sustained
screen exposure any actor craves.
   ``It's a huge, great leading role, and it's been a long time
since I'd done that,'' Holm said of ``Game Set and Match,'' Granada
Television's adaptation of the Len Deighton trilogy which starts its
13-part run March 26 on PBS.
   Holm, 57, has made an art form out of the supporting role: a
robot in ``Alien,'' a fictionalized Lewis Carroll in ``Dreamchild,''
a maudlin dinner guest in ``Wetherby,'' and his Oscar-nominated turn
as the eccentric running coach in ``Chariots of Fire.''
   Now, he comes to Deighton's cloak-and-dagger world as Bernard
Samson, a laconic MI6 secret agent who suffers the ultimate betrayal
_ the discovery that his wife is a Soviet mole.
   The $8.55 million series took more than a year to make, shooting
in Mexico, Germany and England. It was the first film to be allowed
to shoot on location at Checkpoint Charlie, the American crossing
point through the Berlin Wall.
   ``It becomes a way of life; you can't really believe it's
finishing,'' he said. ``As somebody said, `My God, we're all still
speaking to each other.'''
   During that time, Holm says, he could have made four major
movies. But ``with all these cameos (behind me), I sort of thought,
let's go for it.''
   The series is vintage Deighton: quirky, multistranded and as
complex as a Times crossword puzzle. Viewers dare not blink for fear
of missing a clue.
   It offers an abundance of meaty supporting roles for its British
and German cast. But its basic texture is oblique and understated, a
perfect vehicle for Holm's extraordinary ability to express seething
emotion beneath a calm surface.
   ``I suppose I leapt (for the role), in a way,'' the slightly
built, amiable Holm said in an interview that included imitations of
John Gielgud, reminiscences of a chance supper with John le Carre,
and thoughts about the acting techniques of John Hurt and Robert
DeNiro.
   A psychiatrist's son, Holm is chiefly admired for the stillness
and unfussy psychological truth of his technique. London's weekly
Observer newspaper recently asked actors to name their favorite
actor. Holm came second, behind Laurence Olivier.
   ``It's the best compliment one can garner,'' said Holm, pleased
at being thought of as an actor's actor. But he offers no blueprint
for success: ``I don't mean to be flip, but you learn your lines and
get on with it.''
   ``I'm very happy doing nothing; I'm a great doing-nothinger,'' he
said. ``I like having time to stand and stare.''
   His ability to disappear into a role is reflected in public
reaction to his work in ``Alien.'' ```Alien' was a huge success, but
people would say, have you seen `Alien?' I'd say, I was in it!' ''
   A graduate of London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Art,
Holm was a leading classical actor in the 1950s and 1960s.
   He played the Fool to Charles Laughton's King Lear, and his
Richard III in the Royal Shakespeare Company's landmark 1963 ``The
Wars of the Roses'' was likened to Olivier's.
   His portrayal of the repressed Lenny in Harold Pinter's ``The
Homecoming'' won him a 1967 Tony Award when it transferred to
Broadway.
   But in 1976, while heading a revival of Eugene O'Neill's ``The
Iceman Cometh,'' Holm suffered a nervous breakdown during the first
preview and dropped out.
   ``I'm not a particularly emotional, nervous, or depressive type,
so when that thing happened, it was a severe shock,'' he said.
   Holm has since appeared in only one play, a London fringe staging
of Chekhov's ``Uncle Vanya.'' He says the stage ``still absolutely
terrifies me,'' and he refused the starring role in the upcoming
West End production of the Broadway hit ``M. Butterfly.'' Anthony
Hopkins got the part.
   He enjoys making movies and would like to work again with Woody
Allen, after appearing alongside Gene Hackman, one of his favorite
actors, in Allen's recent ``Another Woman.''
   His next film role is as the Welsh captain Fluellen in ``Henry
V,'' alongside Paul Scofield, Derek Jacobi, Judi Dench and Kenneth
Branagh, who also directs.

   Actor Taurean Blacque says he sometimes has an
eerie feeling that his role as the head of a black family in the new
NBC daytime serial ``Generations'' was lifted right out of his own
life.
   Blacque stars as Henry Marshall, owner of a successful chain of
ice cream stores in Chicago and the father of three children in
``Generations,'' which debuts on Monday. Patricia Crowley stars as
the matriarch of the white family in the show.
   The serial, created by Sally Sussman who is also the executive
producer, marks the first time a daytime soap opera has ever
premiered with black actors in such prominent roles.
   ``The character reminds me a lot of me in real life,'' said
Blacque, who is probably best known for his role as Detective Neal
Washington in the much-honored police series ``Hill Street Blues.''
   ``I have a large family, eight children. I have a son almost
identical to Adam, my son on the show. Adam came to me in an episode
and asked me to bail him out of a scrape at the fraternity with
$3,000. That happened to my own son. I couldn't let this role go by.
I wanted to share what we parents go through, black and white.''
   Blacque, who is divorced, has two grown children and a grandchild
and has recently taken six young children into his home.
   It began during the last year of ``Hill Street Blues,'' when the
Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services asked him to be
a spokesman for the adoption of black children.
   ``I said I wanted to be involved,'' he said. ``I said I wanted to
know what it was all about. I wanted to speak from experience.''
   First, he adopted a set of twin boys, Chris and Paul. Since then
he's adopted Jennifer, 2{, Mark, 15 months, Whitley, 13 months, and
Marshall, one month. Jennifer, Mark and Marshall are brothers and
sister. Marshall got his name from Blacque's new role, which he got
on the day the boy was born.
   Blacque has a full-time nanny to look after the children and
recently leased the house next-door so that he can adopt three more
children.
   ``I now have a 9-to-5 work schedule,'' he said, ``which is
perfect for the children.''
   Blacque heard about the new serial when he ran into actress Joan
Pringle at an NAACP awards dinner a year ago.
   ``She told me about `Generations' and said, `You'd be perfect for
my husband,''' Blacque recalled.
   ``I called my agent and he said NBC wanted me for the role but
he'd told them I wasn't interested in doing a soap opera. Well, we
quickly arranged for an audition and I was cast in the role.''
   Patricia Crowley heads the cast as attorney Rebecca Whitmore,
matriarch of the Whitmore family and a longtime friend of Henry
Marshall.
   ``It's breaking new ground, just like `Hill Street Blues' did,''
said Blacque, who starred for seven years in that show. His role as
Henry Marshall is totally different from Detective Neal Washington,
as is his physical appearance. The beard and the trademark toothpick
are gone and his trimmed hair now has traces of gray.
   The bond between the Marshalls and the Whitmores goes back three
generations. Marshall's mother-in-law (Lynn Hamilton) had been
housekeeper for the Whitmores, and her daughter (Joan Pringle) grew
up in the house. The Marshalls have three children, Chantal (Sharon
Brown), Adam (Kristoff St. John) and Jacqueline Marshall Rhymes. The
latter role and those of her husband and children have not yet been
cast.
   Marshall is a former gang member who, with the help of a strong
wife, turned his grandmother's recipe for ice cream into a growing
business. He's a man who wants to pass his success on to his
children, and is as demanding of them as he is of himself.
   In particular, that puts him into conflict with his son, who
doesn't see the value of staying in college for a master's degree in
business administration.
   ``I don't like the way my son's taking care of business,'' he
said. ``He's going to be in for a rude awakening. Henry's also a man
who takes kids off the street and out of the gangs and gives them
jobs.''
   Blacque said of the show: ``It's so positive. I think that's why
we're all doing it. If we can reach youngsters and show them other
ways besides guns and drugs ... We can show them that you can make
it as a black person.''

<HEAD>A New West German Trend is to Work Less</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Work less?
   That doesn't sound like the people who brought West Germany up
from the ashes of World War II and made it the rich and powerful
nation it is today.
   But it is the trend these days among workers, some of whom
already are on the job only 32 hours or four days a week.
   ``Work is not in the center of life anymore,'' says Meinhard
Miegel, a social scientist who heads the Institute for Economy and
Society in Bonn. ``Leisure time has become a more important part of
German life.
   ``This is not laziness. This is just a normal expression of a
very wealthy socitive, even for
industry.
   ``People have become much more relaxed, without hurting the
country's overall productivity. More free time increases creativity
and spontaneity, which is important for a nation.''
   But industrial groups maintain the trend will mean higher labor
costs.
   ``We do see a danger that other countries might start to look
more appealing to some companies,'' says Hermann Olbermann,
spokesman for Gesamtmetall, an organization that represents
employers in the metalworking and electronics industries.
   The issue has set off a lively debate across West Germany as
workers demand further reductions in their working time, which for
unionized employees now range from 32 to 39 hours a week.
   Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of West Germany's opposition
Social Democrats and governor of Saarland state, came under fire of
union friends last year by saying further cuts in the work week
would be acceptable only if workers took less money.
   Unions want a shorter work week but not be at the expense of wage
increases.
   Employers counter that continuous pay increases coupled with
lessened working hours could hinder companies' ability to make a
reasonable profit and also make West Germany less attractive as a
place to do business.
   While West German workers have a reputation for industriousness,
in recent years they have succeeded in shrinking working hours to
the extent that on average, according to some estimates, they now
spend less time on the job a year than any other workers in the
world.
   The German Employers' Association, West Germany's largest
organization representing the interests of German businesses, says
that a worker averages 1,716 hours on the job annually, compared
with 1,912 hours in the United States and 2,138 in the Netherlands.
   A few hundred employees at an Aachen tire plant are already
scheduled to go on a three-day work week spread over 32 hours, and
some workers with the BMW auto company work a four-day, 36-hour week.
   West Germans are also the best-paid workers in Europe _ in 1987
the average hourly wage including benefits was the equivalent of
about $18, compared to about $15 an hour for the Dutch. Exclusive of
benefits, the West German average hourly wage is $10, compared to
$9.54 in the United States.
   West Germans also get 30 working days of annual vacation, which
amounts to six weeks for those working a five-day week and more for
those who work fewer and than five days.
   Indicative of the less-work trend, thousands of teachers and
newspaper employees went on strike recently in demand of shorter
working hours or no weekend work.
   In addition, the IG Metall union, West Germany's largest labor
organization with more than 2 million members, is battling with
employers for a cut in the number of weekly hours for metalworkers
to 35 from an average of 37.5.
   But employers' organizations like Gesamtmetall are starting to
resist.
   ``These (IG Metall) demands would put companies at a distinct
disadvantage, compared with labor conditions in other countries,''
says Olbermann, spokesman for the Cologne-based Gesamtmetall.
   In making its demands for shorter working hours, IG Metall says
further cuts are needed as a means of reducing West Germany's 8
percent unemployment rate.
   ``We think that the reduction of working time is the only
possibility to create new jobs,'' says Martin Oertel, an IG Metall
spokesman at union headquarters in Frankfurt.
   But employers are not likely to hire more workers when it means
extra costs for mandatory social programs while workers aren't
willing to take salary cuts for shorter hours.
   West German companies chalk up good profits every year and the
country remains one of the most productive in the world.
   That's why Juergen Fusswinkel, a mechanic at a Bonn Volkswagen
dealership, believes he should work less.
   ``Free time has become very important, because we Germans are
known for high-quality work and there is a lot of pressure to keep
this up. Employees deserve their free time for all their hard work.''

<HEAD>A Good Old-Fashioned Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A feeling is growing that what this economy needs
is a good old-fashioned recession.
   That option, a distasteful one, was avoided by most
positive-thinking folks until just the past few weeks. There must be
easier ways, better ways to get a grip on inflation, they said. But
now they wonder. Their doubts increase.
   The doubts are aroused by the failure of words, fears, warnings
and rising money costs to do very much to slow expansion of the
economy, which most reasonable economists believe has about reached
its limits.
   The economy needs a rest, they say. Consumption has to slow in
order for producers to catch up _ to make their factories bigger and
more productive. A bigger labor pool is needed too, but that takes
time. You can't speed it up.
   While there is much agreement among economists public and private
about the situation, they haven't been able to convince the public.
Week after week their warnings are ignored, their forecasts sneered
at, their theories exploded.
   Consumer confidence rises, and when that happens, people buy,
even if they have to borrow to do so. Manufacturers express
confidence about an even bigger economy by raising expenditures for
bigger and better factories.
   Manufacturers are also building their inventories, which amounts
to defiance of all the threats and warnings of a downturn. What if
they can't sell off the inventories? Good old rebates and
below-market financing, they say.
   So far, it appears, rising interest rates have done little to
sober up buyers. Ask most consumers what rates they pay on credit
cards and they can't say. Ask what percentage of interest payments
are tax deductible (20 percent) and they can only guess. Ask if
interest on their home-equity loan is capped (most aren't) and they
can't respond.
   By his actions, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board believes the absence of fears, the strong expectations and the
expressions of confidence add up to a false picture of reality.
   The reality, he suggests, is that the economy cannot do
everything expected of it, that inflation is an inevitable
consequence of trying to exceed the economy's capability, and that
even higher interest rates might be required.
   Reality, he indicates, must be re-established in American life.
   There are critics, however, who believe that the Fed itself is
unrealistic in attempting to bring a high-flying economy with many
ailments to a soft landing through higher interest rates.
   Rising interest rates, for example, add billions of dollars to
Uncle Sam's credit costs, interefere with the ticklish rescue of
already undermined savings and loan institutions and worsen the
plight of third-world nations.
   Higher interest rates can also force up the value of the dollar,
which in turn could make it more difficult for American exporters to
remain competitive, which probably would worsen the U.S. balance of
payments deficit.
   Slowing the economy by pressing the interest rate key never was
an easy job. It has led to more recessions, intentional and
accidental, than any other invention of economic minds. And the job
today is even more sensitive.
   It is made especially so because of the great gap that seems to
exist between reality as perceived by the economy's private sector,
which attempts to expand, and the Federal Reserve, which seeks to
contract.
   Conceivably, the gap might be closed only through
recession,intentional or accidental.

   On March 27, 1964, an earthquake of
record-breaking proportions seized southcentral Alaska and set off
sea waves that punished far-off Pacific ports. Ward Sims, now
retired as AP bureau chief for Alaska, covered the disaster.

   The earthquake that shuddered across
Alaska on that Good Friday packed so strong a punch that it knocked
out a seismograph in Fairbanks. It took a seismologist at a small
college in Mobile, Ala., to warn the world of what was to come.
   ``It could cause great devastation,'' Louis Eisele predicted.
``You can expect tidal waves from this one.''
   The earthquake had been felt by Eisele's Spring Hill College
seismograph. It said the temblor was centered about 3,600 miles
northwest of Mobile, in the Gulf of Alaska or near Kodiak Island.
   At 8.5 on the Richter scale, the 1964 earthquake was the most
powerful ever in North America and one of the strongest on record.
   In the words of the U.S. Geological Survey: ``The entire earth
vibrated like a tuning fork.''
   The quake started at 5:36 p.m. Alaska Standard Time on March 27.
Centered under a glaciated peninsula 75 miles east of Anchorage, it
altered 100,000 square miles of landscape.
   Along a 600-mile arc from Cape Yakataga on the eastern Gulf of
Alaska to the Trinity Islands southwest of Kodiak, the land to the
north subsided by as much as six feet; to the south it rose by as
much as 50 feet.
   Land shifted horizontally as much as 70 feet in several places
south of Seward, tangling railroad tracks, splitting roads, yanking
down buildings.
   Property damage exceeded $311 million.
   The earthquake and the seismic sea waves it spawned killed 114
people in Alaska. More than a dozen others died at DePoe Bay, Ore.,
and Crescent City, Calif., when seismic waves crashed ashore at
those communities.
   In the aftermath came the stories of the lucky and the luckless.
Often, merest circumstance determined who died and who survived.
   In Anchorage, William Tobin had just parked his car outside the
new J.C. Penney Building when he felt a jolt. He stepped from his
car ready to have words with another driver.
   ``I thought some stupid jerk had rammed me from behind,'' says
Tobin, managing editor of the Anchorage Times.
   As he got out, a huge slab of the building crashed down,
flattening his car.
   Nine people in Anchorage weren't so lucky.
   In Valdez, many residents had turned out as usual to watch the
freighter Chena disgorge its cargo. The arrival of the 400-foot ship
always was something special for Valdez folks, and on this day _
typically _ a crowd was on hand as longshoremen unloaded the vessel.
   In an eternity that lasted only moments, Valdez was shaken
unmercifully, and the Chena began wallowing insanely, snapping her
mooring lines. The dock heaved, rocked, shook and then pitched into
the water, carrying onlookers and warehouses.
   The Chena survived; the Valdez waterfront and most of the
business district were obliterated by collapsing ground and seismic
waves.
   Thirty-one people died.
   In Kodiak, Norman Holm and his son were fishing for herring from
a skiff in the harbor. Holm could not understand why he suddenly
lost control of the small boat.
   ``I just couldn't make it respond. It kept bouncing, bouncing,''
he says.
   When the movement subsided, Holm headed to the dock. He and his
son, Oliver, helped secure several fishing boats which had broken
loose. He checked the lines of his own 72-foot Neptune.
   The level of water in the harbor started fluctuating wildly, and
then Holm heard ``the terrible roar of water coming up the channel,
the frightening noise of docks and buildings collapsing.''
   The Holms sprinted for shore as the dock creaked and groaned
under the pressure of the rising water. At the head of the dock,
Holm fought the impulse to seek safety atop an eight-foot wooden
tank used to keep crabs alive. He and his son raced about 150 yards
farther to the base of Pillar Mountain, the hill which forms
Kodiak's backdrop.
   With the sound of bedlam in the harbor behind them, they clawed
their way up the steep slope to an elevation of about 150 feet. Holm
was too exhausted to go farther. He told his son to go on, but the
boy stayed with his father.
   The two watched in awe as huge waves battered Kodiak for six
hours. The city lost most of its seafood processing industry, 75
percent of its business district and half its fishing fleet _
including the good ship Neptune. The wooden crab tank vanished.
   Nineteen people died.
   In Chenega, Avis Anderson was preparing to take a bath when the
tiny Prince William Sound village began shaking. She scooped up her
two sons, and dashed up a forest trail to the safety of a high knoll.
   Behind her she could hear the sound of waves estimated up to 80
feet tall smashing the village only 70 miles from the quake's
epicenter. Of the 20 buildings in the town, only the school was
spared.
   Twenty-three people died, including Anderson's daughter, parents,
a grandmother, an uncle and an aunt.
   ``I had horrible, horrible nightmares for almost 20 years,'' she
says. ``Always they were the same. I would be climbing up and up,
and the waves would be creeping higher and higher.''

   Lidia Selkregg speaks quickly, gesturing
intently as she recalls the day the earth unleashed titanic forces
in Alaska and the land slid, heaved and sank.
   Deep beneath the coastline of Prince William Sound, giant layers
of rock jostled and slipped on March 27, 1964. The earthquake
measured 8.5 on the Richter scale and it killed 131 people as far
south as California.
   Now, Selkregg, a geologist and former Anchorage assemblywoman,
says she fears many officials and developers have forgotten that
day's tragic lessons.
   ``They want to think they are more powerful than God. Nature is
nature,'' she said, adding, ``I feel terrible that I have to say
what I'm saying.''
   Some devastated cities have rebuilt away from the areas that
proved vulnerable in 1964, but in others, including Anchorage,
reconstruction was on the old sites. Selkregg and others are afraid
that will mean greater losses in the next great quake, something
they call inevitable.
   ``I'm positive there will be one, I just don't know when,'' says
John Davies, state seismologist. ``But I think the tendency is for
us to forget the lessons.''
   In Anchorage, safety-conscious engineers have clashed with
development-oriented land owners since the rebuilding began.
   ``There is a camp that essentially believes development should go
forward anywhere in the city with little or no regard to the
consequences of earthquakes,'' says Dave Cole, an engineer and past
chairman of the city's advisory Geotechnical Commission.
   Anchorage building codes have addressed the safety of buildings,
but not the ground beneath. Critics say that means sturdy structures
have been built on land that's prone to slide, notably high ground
sought after for its views.
   Around Anchorage in 1964 ``the primary reason for damage and loss
of life was not the shaking of ground, but rather the failure of the
bluff areas ...,'' Davies said. ``We're rebuilding on those areas
right now.''
   Indeed, they're some of the city's prime pieces of land.
   ``It's nicer property, the view property,'' says John Aho, an
engineer and 12-year member of the Geotechnical Commission. ``It's
been long enough (since 1964) so people have forgotten how hard
things can shake.
   ``The developers are not really into wanting to hear about these
things. The administration doesn't want to hear about these things.
People who own the property don't want to hear.''
   Before the quake, homes stood on Turnagain Street. But a
quake-triggered landslide dragged the neighborhood into the sea.
There's debate over whether the site has been adequately buttressed.
   On L Street, site of another major slide, high-rise buildings
have been allowed to sprout, looming over condominiums below.
   ``L Street, that's the one I have no question saying it will move
again if there is a large enough, long enough earthquake,'' says
Duane Miller, head of the Geotechnical Commission.
   But Bruce Phelps, comprehensive planning manager for Anchorage,
says he thinks the city has done enough to protect residents, though
he acknowledged, ``I'm in the minority.''
   Developers proceeded with construction in danger areas because
``there was no legal way to stop them,'' he says.
   ``It's a major policy question. `Do we develop?' I don't know if
it was ill-advised or not.''
   Drafting more stringent regulations regarding ground failure may
be too late now. ``What happens with the buildings that already
exist?'' Phelps says.
   A draft seismic risk study ordered by the city estimates there
could be $300 million in damage from another '64 quake, almost half
of it in slide-prone areas, Coles says.
   The report also indicates that during a mid-morning earthquake of
the 1964 temblor's magnitude, three people would die in the city
because of structural damage.
   ``The potential for death in my opinion was greatly
understated,'' Aho says.
   Across Alaska, other cities also have had to deal with the
ravages of the monster quake.
   The Valdez dock area collapsed into the harbor when 95-foot waves
lashed the waterfront. The city since has been moved to more solid
ground. The old townsite stands barren.
   ``It's hard to predict what would happen if we had another one,''
says Doug Griffin, Valdez city manager. ``I believe that we have
largely learned from the experience and that it would not be as
bad.''
   Seward also was in ruins after the 1964 quake. The jolt and
30-foot waves destroyed more than buildings, it ruined the economy.
The city's railroad tracks, warehouses, fuel tanks, canneries, ship
loading and unloading facilities had been destroyed.
   When the ground started shaking, Seward was the seaport for
Alaska's Interior. ``After that, everything moved to Anchorage,''
says Mayor Harry Gieseler.
   ``That area was not rebuilt, what we've done is move the
industrial base across the bay to an area that is safe,'' he says.
   If another quake and sea wave come, Seward would fare better than
last time, Gieseler says. ``The way the bay lies, all houses and
things are above the 50-foot line, and that's where the water came
up to last time.''
   But in Kodiak, there could be a rerun of the 1964 devastation.
   ``There would be a lot more property loss because ... when the
federal government assisted the city in rebuilding, they rebuilt
primarily where the event occurred,'' says Gordon Gould, city
manager and head of Kodiak's emergency management organization,
which has developed a plan to evacuate the town in 15 to 20 minutes.
   Most of the city's industrial base _ canneries, fuel docks,
warehouses _ is on the waterfront.
   ``This is a fishing village and you have to accept a certain
amount of risk from the sea,'' he says. ``Other than build huge
dikes there's not much you can do.''

   The horror that rocked Alaska 25 years ago
inevitably will happen again somewhere, as huge plates of Earth's
crust regularly slip and produce monstrous earthquakes.
   ``There's absolute certainty a great quake will hit Earth
somewhere every few years, and almost as much certainty that every
20 to 30 years we'll have one of the supergiant quakes, as in Chile
in 1960 and Alaska in 1964,'' said John Nance, author of ``On Shaky
Ground: An Invitation to Disaster.''
   In the United States, Alaska and perhaps the Pacific Northwest
are most prone to superquakes, but California and the eastern half
of the United States have trembled violently in somewhat smaller
temblors _ and will do so again.
   ``It's dangerous arrogance for any of us, wherever we live, to
assume the problem is isolated to any particular region,'' Nance
said by telephone from Tacoma, Wash. ``We stand united in the shadow
of seismic peril.''
   The quake that shook southcentral Alaska on March 27, 1964,
measured 8.5 on the Richter scale, and 9.2 on the ``moment
magnitude'' scale, which seismologists say is the most accurate
measure of large temblors.
   That makes it the second-largest quake ever recorded, and one of
only three ``supergiant'' quakes this century.
   The largest was of magnitude 9.5 on May 21, 1960. It generated a
tsunami sea wave that killed 5,700 people in Chile. The third
superquake was of magnitude 9.0 on April 11, 1952, on the Kamchatka
Peninsula of the Soviet Union.
   Alaska's giant quake relieved so much underground stress that a
repeat in the same location is unlikely for 300 to 1,200 years, said
Christopher Stevens, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist in Menlo
Park, Calif.
   A less powerful but still dangerous quake could hit the same area
much sooner, said USGS seismologist Stuart Nishenko in Golden, Colo.
   Supergiant quakes and great ones _ over 8 on the Richter scale _
are most likely along the edges of the enormous, constantly drifting
plates of rock that make up Earth's crust.
   One danger zone is the Circum-Pacific ``ring of fire,'' which
includes the Pacific coasts of South, Central and North America,
Japan and New Zealand. The other zone stretches from the
Mediterranean Sea east through Turkey, Iran, the southern Soviet
Union and into Asia.
   Superquakes happen only in certain parts of these belts, called
subduction zones, where thinner crustal plates beneath the oceans
smash into and dive beneath thicker continental plates. The diving
plate often hangs up on the overlying plate for decades or
centuries, allowing tremendous stress to build.
   At 5:36 p.m. on Good Friday in 1964, such stress reached the
breaking point 12{ miles beneath Alaska's Prince William Sound. A
chunk of the Pacific plate, hundreds of square miles in area, jerked
spasmodically under Alaska and the North American plate.
   There is potential for similar sudden movement farther south.
   ``A (future) quake equally destructive to Alaska 1964 lurks only
a few dozen miles off the Oregon-Washington coast, ready to lash an
area from northern Vancouver Island all the way to northern
California,'' killing thousands, Nance said.
   Although superquakes happen only along subduction zones, lesser
temblors can occur within plates, such as in the interior of China
and the eastern half of the United States.
   Three ``intraplate'' quakes, estimated at up to 8.6 on the
Richter scale, were centered on a fault deep beneath New Madrid,
Mo., in 1811-1812. They killed several dozen people, temporarily
reversed the flow of the Mississippi River and rang church bells as
far away as Boston.
   Robert Ketter, director of the National Center for Earthquake
Engineering Research, has estimated a modern New Madrid quake would
kill thousands.
   ``The Eastern seaboard is in more danger than the West because
they are abysmally unprepared,'' with building standards far less
stringent than California's, Nance said.

   While Solidarity seeks agreement with
authorities at round-table talks, the small but noisy Confederation
for an Independent Poland has stepped up street protests in a drive
for followers to fight communism.
   Shouts of ``KPN,'' the group's initials in Polish, can be heard
at most demonstrations these days. Its banners painted with a black
anchor, the symbol of the Polish resistance during World War II,
often appear in the front ranks of marches, even those called by
other groups.
   ``Strikes and demonstrations awaken people's emotions and they
become enthusiastic,'' said Zygmunt Lenyk, the KPN leader in Krakow.
``It's easier to awaken the enthusiasm of people who strike and
demonstrate than among those who sit.''
   Lenyk's tiny Krakow apartment serves as the headquarters for a
determined core of young activists dedicated to publicizing the name
of the organization, even though it is illegal.
   KPN is the largest and most active of a range of smaller
opposition groups that reject cooperation with the government and
criticize Solidarity on grounds that it is too moderate.
   The groups, which also include Fighting Solidarity and the banned
Polish Socialist Party, have become more active in recent months and
appear to be trying to coordinate activities through joint meetings
of the self-styled ``anti-system opposition.''
   During a recent national KPN congress, a small brigade of young
people covered city walls with black anchors until they ran out of
paint, while more than 200 of their elders debated the
organization's future strategy.
   ``If we want to be a civilized country, we must liquidate
socialism,'' Lenyk said. ``We have to become a parliamentary
country, and we want to liquidate communism.''
   Socialism and communism often are used interchangeably.
   KPN's straightforward strategy has begun to win new sympathizers,
many of whom once belonged to Solidarity.
   But KPN is far from becoming a movement on the scale of
Solidarity, which as a labor union claimed 10 million members in
1981. KPN claims an active membership of 1,600 and 1,000 more in
youth organizations.
   KPN was founded by the historian Leszek Moczulski on Sept. 1,
1979, the 40th anniversary of Hitler's invasion of Poland.
Supporters say they are attracted by the clarity of KPN's call for
Poland's independence from Communist authorities and the Soviet
Union.
   Though the group claims to favor a peaceful path to independence,
young members of KPN often wear military caps and pants and shirts
made of camouflage fabric and have thrown stones at police in
protests. They say such action is taken only in self-defense.
   The organization's militarism and staunch anti-communism has
resulted in a rift between KPN and Solidarity leaders who are now
seeking change by talking with Polish government officials.
   ``KPN, Fighting Solidarity and other independence groups are
treated by us as rival organizations,'' said Zbigniew Bujak, head of
the Warsaw region of Solidarity.
   But KPN appeals to those who favor fighting Communists rather
than supporting a strategy of negotiating changes with authorities.
   ``I was always engaged in the fight for a free Poland. Solidarity
is a trade union, so now I'm going with KPN,'' said Henryk Holfeier,
a retired economist and former Solidarity member who joined KPN a
year ago.
   ``I was attracted to a program with very decisive and clear
goals,'' said Maria Grcor, a psychologist and editor of Opinia
Krakowska, a bimonthly underground publication. ``Solidarity's goals
are clear, but they are too few and too small.''
   Grcor is also a former Solidarity member.
   ``KPN's ultimate goal is full independence for a democratic, free
Poland,'' she said. ``Solidarity is a bridge to this goal and our
interests are linked together.''
   While Solidarity defends the right of independent groups to
exist, the union leadership has kept its distance from KPN,
maintaining it intends only to be a trade union.
   KPN's main activity is street protests.
   ``Street demonstrations break down the barrier of fear and
encourage the belief that people can do something,'' said Grcow.
``Our main goal is for the group to become a mass organization that
will have an influence on society.'' KPN has attracted strong
support among students, especially in Krakow where university
students allied with KPN founded a new group they call the Student
Organization.
   The historic center of this southern city has been the scene
recently of several violent clashes between young people and police,
and KPN has been represented at almost every demonstration.

<HEAD>Ancient Seville Hopes for Economic Revival in Columbus Celebrations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD LORANT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEVILLE, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christopher Columbus' discoveries in the
New World brought riches to this ancient city in southern Spain.
Five centuries later, Columbus is doing it again.
   This time it is Expo '92, an exhibition commemorating Columbus'
voyages. It will run for six months and end on Oct. 12, 1992, 500
years to the day the explorer reached land in the Caribbean.
   Expo '92 is a gamble by Spain's Socialist government to catapult
one of Europe's most beautiful and most neglected cities into the
21st century.
   On an island across the Guadalquivir River from the old city's
narrow streets and shaded patios, construction workers labor under a
warm sun to transform about 600 acres of largely barren space into
the biggest international exposition ever held.
   The monastery where Columbus' remains were once buried is being
restored as the Spanish Royal Pavillion, where King Juan Carlos
expects to greet dignitaries from the 88 countries, including the
United States, that have signed up to take part in Expo '92.
   A new railroad station will be built on the tracks that run by
the site and a bullet train will carry passengers to the exhibition
in half the three hours' time it takes now.
   But right now Seville is snarled in traffic as work progresses on
dozens of new bridges, roads and other public works that must be
completed by opening day, April 20, 1992.
   In addition to the $922 million the government has budgeted for
administrative costs and on-site construction, authorities will pour
an estimated $5.6 billion into public works projects to improve
roads, railways and airports throughout southern Spain.
   ``Seville is going to have a difficult time, because it's a small
city for so much construction,'' said Antonio Rodriguez Almodovar,
who coordinates public works funded by the regional Andalusian
government.
   ``We've got to ask residents for patience and compassion because
after 1992 this is going to be the most important city in southern
Europe,'' Rodriguez added.
   The government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a native of
Seville, has billed Expo '92 as the starting point for the city's
economic renaissance.
   Angel Ojeda, the Andalusian autonomous regional tax commissioner
and a member of the Expo '92 Corp.'s board of administrators, said
the project is expected to break even on the proceeds from entry
fees, royalties, pavillion rental and sponsors' contributions.
   Once the administrative capital of Spain's overseas empire,
Seville now presides over Andalusia, the country's poorest region,
where unemployment runs at about 30 percent compared to the national
jobless rate of 18.7 percent.
   A recent study by the National Employment Institute estimated the
exhibition will generate 130,000 construction jobs over the next
four years. About 7,000 other people will be needed to keep Expo '92
running.
   Forty million people are expected to visit the exhibition, which
will leave Seville with an Olympic stadium, a communications center,
a huge municipal park, several theaters and hundreds of new
buildings that organizers hope will house a research and development
complex. Spain will be the host of the 1992 Summer Olympics.
   Six high technology companies _ IBM, Alcatel, Telefonica de
Espana, Fujitsu, Rank Xerox and Siemens _ have signed contracts to
convert their pavillions into research and development and
job-training centers after the fair ends.
   The Expo '92 Corp. has what it calls the ``1993 Plan,'' a
post-exhibition project to cut travel time between Seville and the
coastal resort areas of Malaga to the southeast, Huelva to the
southwest, and Cadiz to the south, rather than massive investments
in hotels in Seville itself. The number of hotel beds in Seville
will be doubled, however.
   ``It's better to improve communication with the Huelva coast,
which will be 45 minutes away, than build hotels in Seville that are
forced to close in 1993,'' said Jacinto Pellon, general director of
the Expo '92 Corp.
   Three luxury hotels are planned for the Expo '92 site, along with
an ``Expo City'' of residential units for people who come here to
set up the exhibitions.
   Expo '92 project has not missed any construction deadlines so
far, and public works coordinator Rodriguez said contracts called
for all the major public works to be finished on time.
   But Pellon said poor administrative coordination has held up
approval of Marina de Sevilla, a private, $69.6-million complex that
includes a civic center, 300-room hotel, a marina and shopping
center on about 40 acres of public land along the river.
   Marina de Sevilla's managing director, Arturo Moya, said if the
city and central governments do not approve the development by May 1
investors will reconsider the project. Among the investors is
Management Resources of Tustin, Calif., which has pledged a
33-percent stake.

   Agriculture is under constant assault from
drought, pests and disease. A key defense is genetic material in
seeds that can alter and fortify species. The seed banks that store
this material, called germplasm, thus stand literally between world
plenty and famine. But chronic neglect at America's largest seed
bank threatens the precious hoard, as reported in the first story of
a three-part AP Extra series, ``Seeds of Conflict.''

   Thousands of irreplaceable crop seeds
are dead or dying in an antiquated, underfunded federal seed bank,
imperiling the future of U.S. agriculture.
   Furthermore, the United States is jeopardizing access to new seed
samples by banning seed trade with six countries it considers
adversaries.
   These are principal findings of a three-month Associated Press
investigation of U.S. policies affecting germplasm, the plant
genetic material needed to breed heartier crops able to resist
drought, pests, disease and the global warming trend called the
greenhouse effect.
   American farmers are reaping four times the corn and potatoes per
acre that they could 50 years ago. Wheat and rice yields have
doubled. At least half of these gains come from higher-yielding crop
varieties bred with germplasm from around the world.
   Germplasm is ``as important as air food, or water,'' said Henry
L. Shands, national leader of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
germplasm program.
   The National Seed Storage Laboratory, housed in a three-story
yellow building on the Colorado State University campus in Fort
Collins, is the world's largest seed bank. Its nine concrete,
subfreezing storage vaults bulge with 232,210 seed samples in paper
and aluminum packets.
   But the AP found that in tests conducted within the last five
years, only 28 percent of the samples, or 64,036, met a government
standard that 66 percent of the seeds in a sample will sprout.
   Fully 72 percent, 168,174 samples, either haven't been tested in
at least five years, contain too few seeds to risk testing, or
failed to meet the 66 percent standard.
   ``I would maintain that these seed banks are seed morgues. What
goes in isn't going to come out alive,'' said Major Goodman, a crop
geneticist at the University of North Carolina.
   Many untested samples are certainly dead or dying, either because
of improper storage or failure to regrow them quickly enough, said
Garrison Wilkes, a crop scientist at the University of Massachusetts
in Boston.
   And efforts to replenish the collection are being jeopardized by
U.S. foreign policy, an AP examination of hundreds of pages of
government documents revealed.
   Despite an official policy supporting the free flow of germplasm
among all nations, the United States has quietly banned germplasm
trade with six countries it considers unfriendly: North Korea, Cuba,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Nicaragua and Libya.
   Some USDA officials have fought the embargoes, fearing a backlash
in which other Third World countries would deny germplasm to the
United States. Developing countries are the birthplace of most
important food crops, and it is there geneticists must go to search
for desirable new traits.
   The issue is expected to flare April 17-21 at a meeting in Rome
of the Commission on Plant Genetic Resources, part of the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization.
   Recent advances in genetic engineering have further raised the
stakes. The ability to swap genes among different species will
greatly reduce the time it takes to breed new crop varieties.
   Jeremy Rifkin, a well-known activist who has won important court
battles to regulate biotechnology, filed suit in 1987 charging the
USDA with harming the environment by failing to safeguard its seed
samples. A decision is expected soon.
   A visit to the Fort Collins lab found no guards or alarm systems
protecting the seeds or costly lab equipment. The vaults are
protected by a metal gate secured only with a common padlock. Campus
police patrols provide the only insurance against thieves or
terrorists.
   Even critics acknowledge, however, that conditions have recently
improved.
   For much of its 31-year existence, the lab operated on budgets of
less than half a million dollars. Funding more than doubled in 1988
from $927,580 to $2 million.
   Much of the credit is given to Shands and Steve A. Eberhart, a
research geneticist who became the lab's director in March 1987.
Under Eberhart, staff has been increased, and vital seed data are
being transferred from file cards to computers.
   But even Eberhart concedes it will take years, and millions more
dollars, to correct the lab's failings.
   A computer analysis performed by USDA officials at the AP's
request found that 104,135 samples _ almost half of the lab's entire
collection _ contained too few seeds to risk testing them, Eberhart
said.
   As a consequence, lab officials were unable to say with any
accuracy how many of their seed samples are alive.
   Rep. George E. Brown, D-Calif., chairman of the House
subcommittee on Operations, Research and Foreign Agriculture, called
the U.S. germplasm system ``lousy, measured against the importance
of the problem.''
   Each seed vault at the Fort Collins laboratory can hold 15,000 to
30,000 seed packets. Six cryogenic tanks contain wheat, barley,
oats, lotus and other grains supercooled with liquid nitrogen, a
process pioneered here in hopes of extending the life of seed
samples indefinitely.
   Eight of the nine vaults are full, and the last vault is nearly
so, according to the lab's annual review written in February.
   The USDA computer analysis found that in five years only 82,538
seed samples, or slightly more than one-third of the lab's total,
had been tested to see what percentage of seeds in each sample
remained alive, said Loren Wiesner, the laboratory's curator.
Twenty-two percent of those tested, or 18,502 samples, were below
the USDA's 66 percent standard, Eberhart said.
   Furthermore, 3,770 samples had deteriorated to the point where no
more than a quarter of the seeds would sprout, Eberhart said.
   Of the 104,135 samples that contained too few seeds to be tested,
94,680 are duplicated at other U.S. seed banks, he said.
   But the National Seed Storage Laboratory ``is designed to be the
principal storage facility for agricultural crop seeds,'' noted a
1987 report by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
``Ideally all plant varieties are stored at NSSL as base
collections.''
   The four other seed banks where many of the Fort Collins samples
are duplicated are in trouble themselves, according to figures in
minutes of a September 1986 meeting of the USDA's Plant Germplasm
Operations Committee.
   At the Ames, Iowa, seed bank, 35 percent of samples are ``in
critical need of regeneration,'' as are 25 percent at Pullman,
Wash., 33 percent at Experiment, Ga., and 50 percent at Geneva, N.Y.
These are the most recent figures available, said Shands.
   Donald Duvick, director of research for Pioneer Hi-Bred
International and one of the deans of the U.S. seed industry, said:
   ``Our national stinginess in collecting, storing, renewing and
describing the collections is inexcusable, not only in regard to our
national obligations, but also in regard to our responsiblity to the
entire world.''

   In 1970, 15 percent of the U.S. corn crop was
wiped out when a disease called southern corn leaf blight raced
through the grain belt.
   More than $1 billion in corn was lost in a single year because
the U.S. crop lacked sufficient variations in genetic material, or
germplasm, according to Jack Doyle of the Environmental Policy
Institute in Washington.
   The blight was the closest American agriculture has come to
duplicating the Irish potato famine of 1845-9, in which more than 1
million people died of starvation.
   In each case, the genetic uniformity of the potatoes and the corn
meant that virtually the entire crop was susceptible to destruction
by a single enemy. If the plants had been more genetically varied,
only some would have succumbed, and the losses wouldn't have been as
catastrophic.
   The 1970 corn blight was the ``genetic shot heard 'round the
world,'' botanists say, because it awakened interest in germplasm.
   Fully 80 percent of the cornstalks standing in American soil in
1970 shared at least some of the same genetic material, Doyle said.
   They all contained genes from a single corn plant with a genetic
variant that simplified the production of hybrid seeds, said Don
Duvick, vice-president in charge of research at Pioneer Hi-bred
International in Des Moines, Iowa, one of the nation's largest
producers of seed corn.
   The genes from that plant also made the corn susceptible to
southern corn leaf blight.
   If breeders had used a wider variety of germplasm to breed
American corn varieties, many varieties would not have been
susceptible to the blight. The catastrophic losses of 1970 would
have been avoided.
   Current American corn varieties no longer contain the genetic
material that made 1970 corn susceptible to the blight. But they
remain closely related genetically, and a new pest or disease that
could exploit the shared genes might once again destroy a large
portion of the crop, experts say.
   ``If that is going to happen, we'd better have some genetic
variation on hand to deal with it,'' said Peter Day, director of the
Center for Agricultural Molecular Biology at Rutgers University in
New Jersey.

   The future of U.S. agriculture depends on free
international exchange of seeds. Seeds gathered in far-off countries
contain the priceless genetic stuff American breeders need to
develop crops resistant to insects, disease and drought. Yet, as
reported in the second story of a three-part series, ``Seeds of
Conflict,'' the United States has risked its access to foreign seeds
by imposing political embargoes on shipments of seeds to six
countries.

   Despite repeated vows not to play politics with
the genetic resources critical to the world's food supply, the
United States is quietly maintaining seed embargoes against six
countries it regards as adversaries, government documents show.
   The embargoes contradict stated U.S. policy that these resources
should be the common property of humanity, to be shared as freely as
the air and the sea. The availability of this ``germplasm'' from all
nations is the key to breeding crops able to withstand pests and
such climatic changes as greenhouse warming.
   While America may be the world's breadbasket, it is gene-poor.
The traits responsible for Iowa's hearty corn or the miles of wheat
in Kansas didn't come from this continent. The only native U.S.
crops are the pecan, a few species of berries and an obscure tuber
called the Jerusalem artichoke.
   U.S. breeders thus depend on the good graces of gene-rich nations
in Latin America, Asia and Africa to obtain the germplasm necessary
to ensure future bountiful harvests.
   Yet a three-month investigation by The Associated Press revealed
the United States has put six countries on a germplasm
``blacklist'': North Korea since 1950, Cuba since 1963, Cambodia and
Vietnam since 1975, Nicaragua since 1985 and Libya since 1986.
   The seed embargoes are part of overall trade bans the federal
government has imposed over the years against countries it considers
adversaries.
   Agriculture Department officials fear that including germplasm in
the embargoes could prompt retaliation by developing countries,
leaving U.S. agriculture the prime victim.
   Those officials have struggled for two years to get germplasm
exempted from the embargoes. The State Department has blocked those
efforts, officials of both departments said.
   ``The very great majority of our germplasm resources come here
from overseas, and if I thought there were any impediment to that
exchange, I would raise holy hell,'' said Rep. George E. Brown Jr.,
chairman of the House subcommittee on Operations, Research and
Foreign Agriculture, who expressed shock upon learning of the
embargoes in an interview.
   The California Democrat, whose committee oversees the nation's
germplasm system, called the embargoes ``an example of that age-old
adage: `there ain't no damn reason for it; it's just our policy.'''
   Germplasm is ``an inherent part of our biological system. We
depend on all countries for our germplasm,'' said Henry L. Shands,
head of the USDA's germplasm program and a leader of efforts to end
the embargoes.
   ``I don't think it bodes well for us as a country to say, `We
support a free policy of exchange,' and then have others be able to
say, `Well, you don't send it,''' Shands said.
   Even with the embargoes, American gene banks are unrivaled in
making their resources available to researchers around the world,
said George White, head of the USDA office that approves plant
imports and exports. Each year, 1,500 to 2,000 shipments are sent to
as many as 120 countries, White said.
   ``I really think our record is second to none in making materials
available freely to anyone around the world,'' he said.
   USDA officials note the United States is not alone in restricting
germplasm exchange for political reasons. Ethiopia, for example,
forbids exports of coffee germplasm. Turkey embargoes export of
tobacco germplasm. Egypt bans export of cotton germplasm.
   Furthermore, germplasm embargoes are so easily circumvented that
they amount to little more than a symbolic slap at the targeted
nations.
   Scientists need only slip seeds into an envelope and mail them.
   ``If the Cubans want something from our banks, they can always
ask somebody else to get it for them. They can ask the Soviets, or
the French, or an international agency,'' said Shands.
   So slipshod are the embargoes that White's plant introduction
office itself approved delivery of 13 varieties of cotton seed to
Vietnam in 1977, two years after trade with Vietnam was embargoed,
according to a USDA tally of overseas shipments.
   The same tally indicates 73 germplasm samples were sent to
Nicaragua in 1987 with USDA approval.
   White acknowledged the Vietnam shipment. He said he could not
locate the file describing the Nicaragua shipments.
   ``I imagine that those were sent out by people unaware of the
embargoes, or simply forgot about them,'' said White.
   The issue could open the United States to charges of hypocrisy at
a meeting on germplasm trade of the Food and Agriculture
Organization scheduled for April 17-21 in Rome.
   Embargoes ``bother me not because I know of any specific thing we
lose,'' said Orville G. Bentley, U.S. Assistant Secretary of
Agriculture for science and education. ``It bothers me because of
the inconsistency. All the people I talk to believe in free
exchange.''
   Mounting concern prompted Shands to call several private meetings
over the last two years with officials from the departments of
State, Treasury and Commerce, the three departments besides
Agriculture involved in the import and export of germplasm.
   He drafted a proposed ``memorandum of understanding'' which he
hoped all four departments could sign to exempt germplasm from
embargoes.
   The memo, made available to the AP, set criteria for
``authorizing the importation or exportation of germplasm to or from
a country as to which a ban on trade exists under U.S. law.''
   Shands said he had hoped the memorandum would be signed before
the April meeting of the FAO.
   But a State Department official who participated in the last
meeting eight months ago said others in the department remain
``opposed to making any exception.''
   ``That's pretty much a general, across-the-board position they
take,'' he said. ``They say the same thing to the Coca-Cola company.
There are people all the time trying to get exceptions for a
particular interest. If you start making exceptions to trade
embargoes, they'll be like Swiss cheese.''
   The official, who oversees FAO affairs for the State Department,
spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   USDA officials said the United States had never rejected a direct
request for germplasm by embargoed countries because no country had
asked.
   Yet USDA correspondence shows the United States did reject a
request in 1986.
   Nicaraguan researchers wrote the Rodale Research Center in
Kutztown, Pa., for samples of amaranth, a high protein crop also
known as pokeweed.
   Leon Weber, a researcher at Rodale, sent the seeds to White's
office at the USDA. After some delay, Weber was told that ``there
was no channel to forward the germplasm to Nicaragua because of the
embargo.''
   A handwritten annotation in White's file reads, ``seeds
destroyed.''
   ``That's the tragedy of these kinds of regulations,'' Weber said.
``For political reasons, we're hampering researchers from freely
exchanging germplasm.''

   Guatemalan militiamen brandished machine
guns and ordered Hugh Iltis out of his jeep. Iltis, determined to
protect his precious hoard, brandished right back.
   ``I showed anger _ arrogance, if you like,'' the 63-year-old
scientist recalled. ``I flashed out my documents. They backed off.
They let me go on.''
   This Indiana Jones-style encounter involved neither gold nor gems
but, rather, a humble looking, weedy plant.
   Iltis, an intense, burly, Czech-born botanist at the University
of Wisconsin, is one of the world's foremost collectors of rare
plant species. The precious cargo he was protecting from the
Guatemalans several years ago was a genetic cousin of corn called
teosinte. Because its genes may carry resistance to certain viruses,
this scraggly plant may someday prove more valuable to mankind than
gold.
   As such plant-rich parts of the globe as the Amazon jungle are
stripped and despoiled, scientists and governments are racing time
to gather rare plant species and preserve them before they are lost
forever.
   Iltis has braved harsh climates and tropical sickness and says he
has occasionally given ``gifts'' at customs posts to ensure the safe
passage of himself and his botanical booty across borders. And he
said plant hunters sometimes face tough practical and ethical
choices.
   Increasingly, Third World nations see the germplasm issue as just
another instance of the United States stealing their resources. The
last thing American botanists want to be accused of is plundering
such nations.
   Iltis said that in Mexico, Brazil and other countries that have
placed ``impossibly difficult'' and time-consuming restrictions on
plant exploration, U.S. scientists look for quiet ways around the
regulations.
   ``You're supposed to collect with the permission of Mexico,''
said Iltis. ``I never have, but I always share.''
   Iltis says he makes up for his intrusions by religiously sending
back duplicates of any samples to Mexican scientists. He has also
sent valuable plant reference books to colleagues in Nicaragua and
other Central American nations he has explored.
   Interviews with several plant hunters revealed that conservation,
rather than profit, is most often their prime motivator. Some, like
Iltis, join the hunt for purely scientific reasons that have nothing
to do with improving agriculture.
   ``There is nothing in the world so thrilling to a taxonomist than
to walk into an entirely new flora,'' he told a recent visitor to
his university herbarium where row after row of special movable file
cabinets house hundreds of rare species of corn and other trophies
of more than two decades of expeditions to Mexico, Central America
and the Soviet Union.
   ``For anyone studying natural history, life can never be long
enough,'' he said.
   Slowly, governments, including our own, have begun sponsoring and
financing plant expeditions because rare species may contain genetic
information that plant breeders and geneticists can someday use to
help protect crops from viruses, drought or other life-threatening
blights or hazards.
   Yet despite the limitless potential of this genetic resource
called ``germplasm'' and the high importance scientists attach to
its preservation, the Department of Agriculture has financed an
average of only four expeditions a year since 1956, according to
USDA figures.
   In the fiscal year 1989, a relatively flush year for germplasm
exploration, the government is still spending only $150,000 to
finance about a dozen missions.
   Nevertheless, that is more than the mere $40,000 spent by the
government as recently as 1986, according to Calvin Sperling, head
of the USDA's plant exploration office, who has been on three
expeditions to South America and the Middle East and plans to go to
Turkey this spring to gather wild lentils, chick peas and pistachios.
   Government-sponsored trips tend to be less hazardous than those
undertaken by private scientists, said David Spooner, a USDA
botanist who spends 2-3 months a year on plant expeditions for the
government, mostly hunting potato species. Such trips usually
involve sharing the fruits of the search with scientists from the
host country.
   But prior to his stint as a USDA explorer, Spooner recalls, he
knew all too well the dangers of attempting the same thing on
nothing more than a passport and plane ticket.
   ``I traveled throughout Latin America and I was hassled
constantly,'' he said. In Mexico, police stopped him and asked for
money, he said. In Honduras, police stopped him ``every 50
kilometers'' and challenged him to produce credentials.
   ``What do you do if authorities ask for bribes?'' mused William
Alberson, a University of Wisconsin plant research associate who has
explored for plants in Colombia and other South American countries.
``You pay it.''

   Whose seeds are they, anyway? The United States
and Third World countries have grappled for years over who should
own and profit from the genetic material breeders use to develop
heartier crops. The final part of a three-part series, ``Seeds of
Conflict,'' describes the high-stakes conflict some now call ``seed
wars,'' which may flare anew at a meeting in Rome next month.

   Crop improvements from wild seeds gathered in
foreign countries mean billions in added profits to American farmers.
   Now some of those countries are demanding a share.
   All of America's major crops first sprouted in foreign soil, and
that's where plant breeders must go to look for varieties with
valuable genetic traits.
   The need for ever heartier wheat in Kansas sends botanists to
Turkey. For disease-resistant corn, they search Mexican
mountainsides. To breed the tubers needed for flawless potato chips,
they go to Peru.
   ``The United States has depended on the genetic resources of the
rest of the world to develop its agricultural base,'' noted the
General Accounting Office in a review of America's germplasm
policies.
   Now U.S. access to foreign germplasm is threatened by many of the
developing countries with the richest stores. They are angry they
haven't shared in profits generated by new varieties developed from
plants that once grew wild in their own soil.
   The key issue in this growing rift between developed and
developing countries is patent rights: whether or not plant breeders
have the right to patent commercially produced seed lines. The
United States insists they do.
   Third World nations call that genetic imperialism. They believe
commercial seed lines should be exchanged as freely as the raw
germplasm that originates in their countries.
   ``For years now, the Third World has been donating this material
on the principle that these botanical treasures form part of the
`common heritage' of all humanity,'' said Clarence Dias, president
of the International Center for Law in Development, located in New
York City.
   ``Meanwhile, (industrialized nations) have been patenting the
offshoots of this common heritage and are now marketing its new
varieties, at enormous profit, back to the Third World.''
   Officially, the United States agrees that germplasm is the common
heritage of mankind. But the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act and a
1980 Supreme Court decision established the right of breeders to
patent their products.
   ``Our allowing the patenting of plants doesn't help our
negotiators who are arguing that plants are the common heritage of
mankind,'' said a knowledgeable congressional aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``We're in Rome arguing `common heritage'
and in courtrooms in the U.S. arguing individual ownership.''
   ``Third World countries don't like it,'' said Rodolfo Quintero, a
prominent Mexican biologist affiliated with the United Nations.
``The potential for hurting the developing countries is real.''
   Plant patenting, he said, has already denied Mexico profits it
feels it is due. A food developed from a Mexican form of algae was
patented as shrimp feed in Japan, and Mexican shrimp farmers are now
paying royalties to Japan, Quintero said.
   The ``seed wars'' debate has simmered within the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization since 1979. The latest round will be fought
at a meeting of the FAO's Commission on Plant Genetic Resources
scheduled for April 17-21 in Rome.
   The United States will once again be asked to endorse the
International Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources enacted by the
FAO commission 5{ years ago. The undertaking extends the principle
of free exchange to commercial seed lines.
   Mexico led the fight for the undertaking and the creation of the
FAO commission to oversee it. Many of the ideas underlying the FAO's
actions came from the writings of Pat Roy Mooney, a Canadian
economist who favors compensating developing countries for the use
of their germplasm.
   Currently 116 countries have endorsed the undertaking or joined
the commission, including France, West Germany, the Netherlands,
Great Britain and other developed countries, said the commission's
secretary, Jose Esquinas-Alcazar.
   But the United States has not. It attends commission meetings
only as a silent observer.
   U.S. refusal to participate could prompt a backlash in which
other countries would deny germplasm to the United States, some U.S.
officials fear.
   India, for example, the sole source of important varieties of
cotton and other crops, now bars the collection of seeds by
Americans.
   ``I'm inclined to think that in that case it's an outgrowth of
this whole FAO debate,'' said Charles Murphy, secretary of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture's National Plant Genetic Resource Board.
   Some U.S. agriculture officials favor softening American
opposition to the commission because they fear it could further
restrict U.S. access to foreign germplasm.
   The FAO's Esquinas insisted that U.S. membership in the
commission would not compel America to accept any position, but
would merely signal a willingness to listen and debate.
   The United States is being hurt in the eyes of developing
countries, Esquinas said, by its failure to participate. ``The
countries ask why,'' he said.
   Hoping to improve the American position in Rome, the U.S.
National Plant Genetic Resource Board called last year for
reconsideration of U.S. opposition to the undertaking.
   Germplasm experts from around the world met at Keystone, Colo.,
last summer to try to find a way to resolve the FAO dispute. They
couldn't agree on how to reconcile patenting and the FAO
undertaking. But they did agree to support an existing international
fund to channel money from industrialized nations to training and
conservation programs in developing countries.
   The fund was established by the FAO in 1987, and it has received
pledges of about $500,000 so far, Esquinas said.
   Still, the odds remain against the United States joining the
commission in April, said Wayne Denney, a USDA official who will
help represent the United States at the April meeting.
   ``It will suggest that something we opposed vigorously in many
forums wasn't so bad after all.''

   Rafael Guzman stepped gingerly down a
narrow, twisting dirt path through tall, dense shrubs in the verdant
Sierra de Manatlan Mountains southwest of Guadalajara.
   In a clearing stood a thicket of tangled, golden cornstalks 8
feet tall. Instead of the usual ears, the stalks bore tiny seed
husks not much bigger than pea pods, each filled with eight or 10
misshapen brown kernels.
   ``This is the thing that has caused all the controversy,'' Guzman
said, reaching up to split a husk and let its kernels fall.
   The discovery a decade ago of this distant relative of corn,
called Zea diploperennis, ranks as one of the botanical finds of the
century.
   Zea diploperennis, part of a family of wild corn plants called
teosinte, has three genetic properties that excite plant breeders:
it is a perennial, meaning it grows back every year without
replanting; each stalk produces multiple ears of corn, unlike
single-eared U.S. grain belt corn, and it is resistant to more than
a half dozen plant diseases.
   Scientists hope they can use Zea diploperennis to breed perennial
commercial corn. That could mean billions of dollars for farmers who
would no longer have to replant each spring.
   Perennial corn is probably decades away, scientists said at a
meeting in Guadalajara last December to mark the 10th anniversary of
the discovery. But commercial breeders could harness Zea
diploperennis's disease resistance within five to 10 years, they
said.
   At that meeting, researchers also tackled the troublesome
question of who should pay the bill to preserve Zea diploperennis.
   So far, Mexicans have borne the cost. Their fear is that American
seed companies will get the profits.
   The plant's seeds are now stored in seed banks all over the
world. There is no longer any danger it will become extinct.
   But much of its value will be lost if it isn't maintained in the
wild where it must continually develop resistance to new insects and
diseases, scientists said.
   The Sierra de Manatlan Biosphere Reserve is one of only three
places in the world where Zea diploperennis is found. All are in
Mexico.
   The University of Guadalajara is spending $300,000 a year to
maintain the reserve and operate its Las Joyas laboratory there.
   ``For accepting that challenge they deserve to be
congratulated,'' said Garrison Wilkes of the University of
Massachusetts in Boston, an authority on teosinte. ``The world
community is dependent on Mexico.''
   ``Companies should pay and governments should pay,'' said Guzman,
now at the University of Wisconsin but until recently the
laboratory's director.
   ``Maybe it can be done through scientific cooperation between the
United States and Mexico,'' he said, suggesting contributions of
money, textbooks and equipment as well as exchanges of students and
scientists.
   His argument holds particular force in Mexico because of its
foreign debt of $104 billion, the second largest in the developing
world after Brazil.
   Guzman and Hugh Iltis, a botanist at the University of Wisconsin,
discovered Zea diploperennis long after it was thought to be extinct.
   The story began in 1977 when Iltis sent Guzman a Christmas card
with a drawing of Zea diploperennis on the front.
   Botanists believed the plant, which had evolved in Mexico a
million years ago, had become extinct early in the 20th century as
Mexico's growing population converted wilderness to farmland.
   The Christmas card gave Guzman, then a student at the University
of Guadalajara, an idea. He took the drawing into the hills above
Guadalajara and began to ask local farmers, the campesinos, whether
they had ever seen anything like it.
   ``One campesino took an interest,'' Guzman recalled. ``He said he
knew this plant'' and he led Guzman to it.
   But Guzman wasn't convinced. He dug up the plant and took it to a
university greenhouse. There Iltis and Guzman made the definitive
identification. The discovery was announced in a scientific journal
in 1979.
   A short time later, Guzman and Iltis were on a seed collecting
expedition in the Sierra de Manatlan Mountains when they stepped
over a ridge into a valley of overgrown pastures broken by clumps of
trees where the laboratory now stands.
   They stopped. Zea diploperennis was growing all over the
hillsides.
   ``No botanist had ever been here before,'' said Iltis. ``Can you
imagine how we felt? We just stared at each other in disbelief.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's seed bank system, shown in a
three-month investigation by The Associated Press as beset with
storage and political problems, is already making changes, prodded
by a lawsuit by prominent biotechnology critic Jeremy Rifkin.
   Rifkin, who has won several landmark court battles to regulate
gene splicing, filed the suit eight years ago in an attempt to force
the USDA to disclose the severity of the problems in the seed banks.
   Henry L. Shands, national germplasm leader at the USDA, said the
suit has prompted the preparation of an operating manual covering
management of seeds of major crops.
   The manual, a draft of which is expected to be completed later
this year, provides that the germplasm system would for the first
time ``have a procedure and have it out on the table so that Rifkin
or anyone else can inspect it.''
   Rifkin chose an unusual legal strategy, charging that the failure
to properly protect the collections in the seed banks was causing
the loss of often-irreplaceable seed samples and thus harming the
environment.
   Therefore, he argued, the USDA should be required to file an
environmental impact statement. Rifkin hoped that would disclose the
severity of the system's troubles.
   Final arguments in the suit have been heard and a decision is
expected soon, Rifkin said.
   ``Germplasm is as critical to the age of biotechnology as oil,
natural gas, coal and metals were to the industrial age,'' he said.
   ``The U.S. germplasm system has been a failure from top to bottom
for 10 years. ... This is an attempt on our part to force the
government to respond.''

<HEAD>Texaco Board Approves New Poison Pill; Shareholder Vote Is Next</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The directors of Texaco Inc. have approved a new
``poison pill,'' a shareholder-rights plan intended to make a
hostile takeover of the nation's third-largest oil company more
difficult.
   The poison pill allows shareholders to buy extra shares of Texaco
stock at a steep discount. With more shares on the market, the cost
of an unfriendly takeover would escalate sharply.
   The terms of the pill _ which replaces a shareholder-rights plan
due to expire April 7 _ were reviewed by the investment firm Salomon
Brothers Inc. on behalf of a committee representing Texaco
shareholders, Texaco said in a statement Thursday from its White
Plains, N.Y. headquarters.
   The plan now goes to shareholders for their approval at Texaco's
May 9 annual meeting.
   A shareholder vote on a poison pill is rare. But Texaco agreed to
the condition after shareholders handed the company a victory in a
proxy fight with takeover strategist Carl Icahn.
   Texaco promised the committee representing shareholders in its
then-ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization it would not issue
another poison pill without the approval of shareholders or
authorization from an investment banking firm designated by the
committee.
   The pill had been a point of contention between Texaco and Icahn,
its largest stockholder, until they settled their differences aside
in late January.
   Icahn had been badgering Texaco to boost its stock price and
threatened to mount a takeover to do so if the company failed to
satisfy his demands.
   Texaco underwent a restructuring as part of its Chapter 11
reorganization that included the sale of such major assets as its
Texaco Canada unit and the payment of a special $8-a-share dividend
to shareholders.
   Icahn in turn agreed not to launch or support any proxy fights
against management for seven years.
   The new pill would be triggered if a suitor offering to buy the
company acquired 20 percent or more of Texaco's outstanding common
stock and if the buyout offer does not meet certain conditions.
   Among other things, the offer must be an all-cash, fully-financed
bid and give the Texaco board ``a reasonable opportunity to explore
the available alternatives to maximize stockholder value,'' the
company said.
   The pill also is designed to deter takeover tactics such as
``market sweeps,'' in which a hostile suitor scoops up large amounts
of a company's stock over a short period on the open market, Texaco
said.
   Texaco stock rose 12{ cents to close at $53.62{ a share in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading Thursday.

<HEAD>American Apparently Nears $3.09 Billion Deal With Fokker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines apparently is near a
multibillion-dollar deal with Dutch manufacturer Fokker that would
push the carrier's six-week shopping spree above $10 billion for 300
plane purchases and options.
   The agreement, negotiated over the past five years and worth an
estimated $3.09 billion, would be for 75 F-100 twin-engine jets,
which seat about 100 people each, with options for an additional 75,
Fokker spokesman Bart van Veen said Thursday in Amsterdam.
   American would not confirm the agreement, but van Veen said the
companies are discussing ``the final minor details.'' The deal would
represent a significant breakthrough into the U.S. market for Fokker.
   The announcement comes just one day after the Fort Worth-based
airline, the main subsidiary of AMR Corp., announced a $95 million
expansion of its corporate headquarters and began distributing $121
million in profit sharing to employees.
   American also plans an announcement in the next several weeks of
the location for a $200 million second maintenance facility.
   Analysts said the expenditures indicate the financial strength of
American, the nation's second largest carrier, and reflect the
airline's strategy for modernizing its fleet and expanding its
routes.
   In trading Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR's stock
closed at $60.37{, up 50 cents.
   ``All I can tell you is that we have had interest in Fokker
airplanes along with others,'' said American spokesman Al Becker.
``We are just not in a position at this point to say anything more
about the Fokker airplane.''
   The F-100 is smaller than most domestic airplanes and is ideal
for use on feeder routes of up to 1,100 nautical miles in a hub
system.
   On Feb. 7, American announced an agreement with McDonnell Douglas
Corp. to buy eight long-range MD-11 widebody jetliners with options
for another 42. The airline also took options on 100 MD-80s, a
smaller plane designed to replace the Boeing 727.
   Analysts placed the value of the McDonnell Douglas deal at about
$7 billion.
   American's fleet of 478 planes already is one of the youngest in
the industry at an average of about 9.4 years, and Becker said the
carrier plans to reduce the average to about 8.4 years by 1992. He
said the company's fleet would total more than 600 planes by 1991.
   Last month, Donald J. Carty, the airline's vice president for
planning and finance, said American would spend about $10.5 billion
through the end of 1993 to modernize its fleet.
   Becker said most of the new airplanes would be used to expand
American's routes.
   ``The company's been in a very rapid growth mode since the early
1980s, and these recent activities indicate a continuation of that
program,'' said Mark E. Daughtery, who follows the industry for Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York.
   ``The company is convinced that there are additional domestic and
international market opportunities, and they fortunately have the
financial strength to capitalize on that,'' he said.
   AMR earned a record $476 million last year on $8.8 billion in
revenue, making the airline the nation's most profitable.
   About $121 million of the earnings was set aside for employee
profit-sharing, Becker said. Those checks, averaging about $1,950
per employee, were distributed Wednesday.
   Becker said the company is looking at two locations for its new
maintenance facility, one in Oklahoma City and a second at Alliance
Airport, a project just north of Fort Worth headed by H. Ross Perot
Jr.
   Becker said the announcement of a selection is probably several
weeks away. The project, which is planned to open by 1991,
ultimately will employ about 4,500 people and cost more than $200
million, he said.
   The airline will keep and expand its current maintenance facility
at Tulsa, Okla., Becker said, but ``because our fleet is expanding
so greatly, we believe that long term we will need a second major
base facility.''

with complaints about their sponsorship of TV programs and editorial
projects that some groups find offensive, a constitutional rights
advocate says.
   But Arthur Kropp, president of People for the American Way, said
companies are being shortsighted by caving in to such complaints.
   ``They are not going to be able to sweep these people under the
rug. They will find they are in a constant battle with them,'' he
said.
   On Thursday, two advertisers canceled plans to run commercials on
NBC's popular ``Saturday Night Live'' program after hearing from a
Christian group that pointed out skits in recent episodes that it
found offensive.
   Ralston Purina Co. confirmed that it had dropped plans to run
about $1 million in ads on the program starting in April because it
felt one of the shows ``crossed over the line of good taste.''
   General Mills Inc. said it had canceled an undisclosed number of
ads on the show after reviewing the other episode.
   Both companies said they had heard complaints about the program
from others as well as the Christan group, the American Family
Association of Tupelo, Miss.
   The Rev. Donald Wildmon, who heads the group, has campaigned for
more than a decade against what he sees as pornography and excessive
violence in magazines, TV and movies.
   Last summer, CBS cut 3{ seconds from an episode of ``Mighty
Mouse'' after Wildmon said the scene gave the impression that the
cartoon hero was snorting cocaine. CBS said he was sniffing flowers.
   The ``Saturday Night Live'' case provides another example of
increasing activism by individuals and groups that are trying to end
shows they don't like by urging advertisers to quit buying
commercial time on them.
   Kropp said he understands why companies trying to make a profit
take their ad dollars elsewhere when an activist group complains or
threatens a boycott.
   ``It is much easier to pull ads and avoid controversy. These
companies are not in the business of defending the First
Amendment,'' Kropp said.
   But he said the trend could have a dangerous chilling effect on
the media.
   The American Family Association said it had pointed out two
``Saturday Night Live'' episodes it found ofensive to Ralston and
General Mills and was later notified they each had canceled ads on
the weekly comedy show.
   In one episode, a skit was apparently designed to see how many
times the actors could say ``penis'' on network TV.
   Patrick Farrell, a spokesman for St. Louis-based Ralston, said
Ralston canceled about $1 million in ads on the show for its
Eveready Battery Co. because of the skit.
   Farrell said Ralston had been a sponsor of the program for a
number of years and knew it was sometimes controversial and aimed at
an audience of young adults. But he said the skit ``crossed over the
line of good taste.''
   In the second episode, a skit featured use of the words ``funk''
and ``funking'' as euphemisms for profanity.
   Terry Thompson, a spokesman for General Mills in Minneapolis,
said ``some commercials were canceled'' on the show after the
episode was reviewed. He declined to say many ads were pulled.
   But he said the company's current absence from advertising on the
program ``reflects scheduling fluctuations and nothing else.''
   A Michigan housewife, Terry Rakolta, recently captured national
attention with her letter-writing campaign to advertisers who
sponsored the program ``Married ... with Children'' on Fox
Broadcasting Network.
   Rakolta complained about sexual innuendo and the treatment of
women in the popular program, a comedy about a blue-collar family.
   Since she wrote, big ad spenders such as Procter &amp; Gamble Co.,
McDonald's Corp., Tambrands Inc. and Kimberly Clark Corp. have
instructed their ad agencies not to buy time on the show.
   Last week, Wildmon said the American Family Association was
calling on consumers to quit drinking Pepsi for a year to protest
the soft drink maker's refusal to cancel its advertising contract
with the entertainer Madonna.
   Wildmon said his group felt Madonna's latest music video,
produced separately from her Pepsi ad, contained offensive sexual
imagery.
   The American Family Association publishes a monthly Christian
magazine that claims a circulation of 380,000.

<HEAD>``Animal House'' Star, Partner Take Control of National Lampoon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1978 movie ``Animal House,'' actor Tim
Matheson played a college Don Juan negotiating his way through a
series of romantic liaisons.
   Now, 11 years later, Matheson has negotiated his way into a
liaison with the company that produced the hit film, National
Lampoon Inc.
   Matheson and his business partner, Daniel Grodnik, announced
Thursday they had won control of National Lampoon by buying the
stake in the entertainment and publishing company held by its
founder and chairman, Matty Simmons. The two investors paid Simmons
$6 a share, or more than $761,400.
   Simmons resigned from National Lampoon and was replaced by
Matheson and Grodnik, who will serve as co-chairmen. But Simmons,
who has formed his own production company, will produce an
unspecified number of films for National Lampoon over the next four
years, the company said.
   The acquisition of Simmons' stake gives Matheson and Grodnik
control of about 30 percent of the stock in the company, which
publishes the humor magazine National Lampoon and has also produced
films such as ``National Lampoon's Vacation.''
   In December, Matheson and Grodnik, an independent film producer,
said they might seek control of National Lampoon. In January, they
were named to the company's board.
   Matheson has appeared in a number of films and television
programs, but is best known for his role as Otter, the shallow,
fast-talking womanizer in ``Animal House,'' the raunchy comedy about
a Midwestern fraternity house. The film also starred the late John
Belushi.
   Grodnik said in a telephone interview it was coincidental that he
and Matheson _ who together produced the film ``Blind Fury'' _ ended
up pursuing the company that created ``Animal House.''
   The pair had wanted to raise funds to produce pictures, but were
advised by David Batchelder _ who formerly worked with takeover
specialist T. Boone Pickens Jr. _ to instead search for an existing
entertainment firm that was undervalued.
   Matheson and Grodnik found 23 companies that were possible
candidates, and after they narrowed the field, National Lampoon
emerged as their first choice, Grodnik said.
   ``It was just a marriage that was meant to be,'' he said.
   They approached several shareholders, who agreed to assign the
pair their voting rights. After buying their own stake, Matheson and
Grodnik said they controled more than 21 percent of the company's
stock.
   National Lampoon said it has 10 films in various stages of
development. The firm's next project, ``National Lampoon's Christmas
Vacation,'' is scheduled to go into production later this month.
   Grodnik said he and Matheson would produce films solely through
National Lampoon.
   The new co-chairmen said they were bringing in new executives to
handle the publishing end of the firm. National Lampoon magazine
suffered a readership decline in the early 1980s, but has begun to
turn around, they said.

<BYLINE>Coniston Mulls Raising Bid For TW Services</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners says it might raise its $1.4
billion bid for food services giant TW Services Inc., but the
aggressive investment firm may have little choice if it is taking
its cue from the market.
   On Thursday, TW climbed $2.62{ in active New York Stock Exchange
trading to close at $31.75 a share, a 52-week high that outpaced
Coniston's current $29-a-share tender offer.
   Trading was spurred by the announcement that TW's board was
exploring alternatives to boost shareholder value. Those options
range from selling or reorganizing the company, which owns the
Denny's restaurant chain, to repurchasing shares.
   ``No alternatives are precluded,'' said TW spokesman James Ryan.
   Coniston principal Paul E. Tierney Jr. said in a telephone
interview that the firm planned to review TW's ``information and
adjust our offer accordingly.'' Throughout his exchanges with TW
Chairman Frank Salizzoni, however, Tierney has maintained that
Coniston is offering a premium price to TW shareholders.
   In December letter to Salizzoni, Tierney wrote that Coniston did
not believe ``the market price of TW as a public company is likely
to equal the price we are prepared to pay today for years to come.''
   TW directors, who met Wednesday, reiterated their contention that
Coniston's offer is inadequate. The board authorized financial
advisers First Boston Corp. and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets to
seek ``transactions that reflect ... our strong forward momentum.''
   Coniston repeatedly has pressed TW to ``either negotiate with us
or to auction the company,'' Tierney said. ``We're pleased that
after what seems to be a very long time that they have finally
agreed to sell the business.''
   TW, parent of the 1,220-restaurant Denny's and Spartan Food
Systems Inc., the largest franchisee of Hardee's fast-food
restaurants, reported 1988 profits of $53.7 million, up 15 percent
from a year earlier.
   Coniston owns about 19 percent of TW's 48.5 million outstanding
shares. Together with shares tendered under the offer, Tierney says
over 90 percent of TW stock would be in Coniston's hands.
   In advising shareholders not to tender and to withdraw shares
that already have been tendered, Salizzoni noted that TW operations
``have performed exceedingly well and over plan, reflecting their
growing, leading market positions and improving sales and
profitability ...'' since Coniston made its first overture.
   Separately, the TW board agreed to postpone indefinitely the
company's April 26 annual meeting, where Coniston had planned to
wage a proxy fight to get its candidates elected to TW's 11-member
board. Shareholders are to elect three directors at the annual
meeting.
   Ryan said the meeting was postponed to allow the board time to
``review and entertain alternatives that may produce a higher
value,'' rather than to head off a proxy fight.
   Earlier this month Coniston amended its offer by, among other
changes, removing the condition that the TW board approve a
takeover. The change came after the Delaware Chancery Court upheld
TW's poison pill, which was designed make an unwanted takeover
prohibitively expensive.
   Coniston has said it has spent over $15 million in its effort to
acquire TW.

<HEAD>Permanent `Moles' Could Deter Futures Fraud: Congressman</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A permanent cast of undercover ``moles''
burrowing through the nation's futures exchanges could help deter
cheating by traders, says a congressman who is examining the
industry's regulatory system.
   ``Even though we plug as many holes as we possibly can, there's
always some guy out there who thinks he can beat the system. This
would give him something more to worry about,'' said Rep. Glenn
English, D-Okla.
   English made the comments at a news conference Thursday following
his speech before the annual meeting of the Futures Industry
Association.
   In his speech, English urged leaders of the futures industry to
cooperate with federal investigations of commodity trading fraud and
reassured them that his own probe was not aimed at hindering the
industry's growth.
   ``I do not intend to throw the baby out with the bath water, but
I intend the baby to be squeaky clean,'' he told more than 1,000
brokers, traders and exchange officials.
   Also Thursday, some of the industry's leaders called for a
concerted effort to improve the image of their business in the face
of a federal undercover investigation of suspected cheating at the
Chicago Board of Trade and the Chicago Mecantile Exchange, the
world's two largest futures markets.
   English chairs a House Agriculture Committee subcommittee that is
investigating futures regulation as part of the process of renewing
the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that
oversees futures trading.
   The CFTC's current congressional authorization expires Sept. 30.
The process of reauthorizing the agency through 1994 has been slowed
because of concerns raised by the Chicago investigation.
   The Justice Department's undercover probe has yielded no charges
since it was disclosed Jan. 19. It is believed to be targeting as
many as 100 traders suspected of cheating customers out of millions
of dollars while executing their orders on the exchange floors.
   A futures contract is a contract to buy or sell a commodity or
financial instrument at a specified price at a future date.
   English said the subcommittee's work was only beginning, but he
would not rule out the possibility that it will recommend giving the
CFTC authority to maintain a permanent force of undercover agents to
patrol futures trading floors.
   English said his panel also might consider requiring more
extensive background checks of futures traders and brokers.
   In addition, he suggested that the general trend toward
deregulation during the past decade created an atmosphere that
encouraged ``a small minority of rotten apples'' to cheat in the
financial markets.
   CFTC Chairman Wendy Gramm spoke earlier in the day, saying her
agency would double its efforts to detect and punish trading abuse.
   Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann and Chicago Merc
President William Brodsky also spoke Thursday.
   Mahlmann touted the Board of Trade's electronic surveillance and
trade-auditing systems, which he said were being improved to ``curb
any possible abuses.''
   Brodsky called for coordinated, industry-wide action to improve
fraud-detection and restore credibility to the futures markets.
   ``We are at a very important crossroads in our development,'' he
said. ``When all is said and done, we must come together and work
together.''

<HEAD>CBOT Unveils Electronic Trading System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Traders are calling it ``Nintendo II,''
but whatever the name, the Chicago Board of Trade says its new
electronic futures trading system will usher in a new era of
international futures transactions.
   The Aurora system gets its first public showing today at the
Futures Industry Association's annual meeting here.
   Journalists covering the conference got a sneak preview Wednesday
night. The system resembles a video game and attempts to replicate
on a computer screen the fast-paced competition of a futures trading
pit.
   Aurora will compete with Globex, an electronic trading network
developed by the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange and London-based
Reuters PLC.
   Like Globex, Aurora is designed for trading of futures contracts
during the hours that the exchange's trading floor is closed,
primarily to capture business overseas.
   But unlike Globex and unlike any other electronic trading system
devised over the past 20 years, Aurora can disclose what other
traders are doing in the market and allow users to select the person
with whom they wish to trade.
   A working prototype of Aurora should be ready in September, Board
of Trade officials said.
   The Board of Trade will be the sole owner of the Aurora system,
which incorporates technology developed specifically for the project
by Apple Computer Inc., Texas Insruments Inc. and Tandem Computers
Inc.
   Some Board of Trade members who have been shown a model of the
system during the past month call it ``Nintendo trading'' or
``Nintendo II'' after the popular video game.
   The Board of Trade's entry into electronic trading comes more
than a year after the Chicago Merc announced plans for Globex, which
also goes on line this fall.
   The Merc also leads the Board of Trade in signing up other
exchanges to offer its products for electronic trading.
   The Merc, the world's second-largest futures exchange after the
Board of Trade, has announced Globex links with the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the Sydney Futures Exchange of Australia and
the French futures exchange Marche a Terme International de France,
known as MATIF.
   But Board of Trade Chairman Karsten Mahlmann said the
revolutionary features of Aurora will appeal to traders and win the
industry over.
   ``Aurora is truly the dawning of a new age in international
trading,'' Mahlmann said.
   Futures are binding contracts to buy and sell commodities and
financial instruments at a specified price at a future date.
   The exchanges say they will limit the contracts traded
electronically to financial futures, which are used extensively by
large institutional investors to hedge their risks in financial cash
markets.
   Globex, which is also on display at the Futures Industry
Association meeting, is known in the industry as a ``black box''
system because buy and sell orders entered into the system are
matched by a computer.
   The user of a ``black box'' system does not know the identity of
the person on the other side of the trade.
   The most startling aspect of Aurora is the computer-screen
display. Instead of the rows and columns of information displayed on
the terminal screens of black-box systems, an Aurora user sees blue
squares and red circles on a field of gray.
   Each symbol contains a trader's acronym and a number representing
the price at which that trader is offering to sell (red circle) or
bidding to buy (blue square) a futures contract.
   To make a trade, the Aurora user moves a cursor via a hand-held
``mouse'' from his own symbol to that of another trader and clicks
the mouse's button.
   With many traders in the market, all vying to buy low and sell
high, the action can move very quickly in a fashion that resembles
open-outcry trading, the traditional futures-trading method in which
traders face off in recessed pits and execute trades through a
combination of yelling and hand signals.

   Swissair, Switzerland's national

the United States third-largest carrier.
   The accord, announced at a press conference Thursday, came in a
memorandum of understanding signed Wednesday between Swissair
president Otto Loepfe and Delta Chairman Ron Allen.
   The agreement will coordinate passenger and cargo schedules on
the airlines' North Atlantic routes, and will provide for
coordinated planning and joint marketing. Allen said the agreement
also would provide opportunities for cooperation in the technical

   Both airlines recently ordered McDonnell Douglas' new MD-11.

<HEAD>Dollar Advances Against Yen, Shares Off In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar advanced further today against the
Japanese yen in a carry-over from overseas markets to close at a
five-month high in Tokyo, while share prices lost ground on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.
   The dollar started trading at 131.20 yen and edged down to below
131.00 yen briefly. Late morning trading was met by profit-taking,
traders said.
   But the market's strong desire for yen-selling and dollar-buying
lifted the currency back to close at 131.07 yen, up 0.34 yen from
Thursday's close of 130.73 yen. It was the highest close since Oct.
11 when it closed at 131.15 yen.
   The dollar's bullishness followed a strong showing on overseas
markets overnight following favorable U.S. trade reports released
Wednesday, traders said. In New York, the dollar gained 0.25 yen to
finish at 130.86 yen.
   ``The dollar's strength is a continuation of a worldwide trend
reflecting better-than-expected trade reports of the United States
Wednesday,'' said a trader with a major U.S. bank in Tokyo.
   Another trader for a Japanese commercial bank said political
uncertainties caused by an ongoing stock-profiteering scandal, in
which influential politicians and businessmen were sold unlisted
stocks at artificially low prices, is encouraging yen-selling.
   A Bank of Japan official, however, said the current decline of
the yen does not require immediate action.
   ``We will closely watch further developments,'' he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, the exchange's most widely followed index, lost 77.01 points
to close at 32,021.01.
   The market's main index opened higher on the heels of a sharp
20.17-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average in New York
overnight. But the market's anxiety about creeping inflation and
rising interest rates pulled the index down, traders said.
   ``The market situation is very sensitive right now about
inflation and interest rates,'' said Mike Morizumi, a trader with
Merrill Lynch's Tokyo office. ``Investors are hesitating to buy
shares because of various uncertain factors.''
   He said anticipation over the U.S. producer price index, to be
released in Washington today, has also sidelined many investors.
   ``There is anticipation of a stronger market as reflected in the
strong opening,'' he added.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar advanced against the Japanese yen
but was mixed in calm European trading this morning as dealers
awaited Washington's announcement of the producer price index.
   Gold was steady after falling in Hong Kong. ``There is no sense
of direction,'' said one precious metals trader in London.
   ``The dollar's strength is a continuation of a worldwide trend
reflecting better-than-expected trade reports of the United States
Wednesday,'' said a trader for a major U.S. bank in Tokyo.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.34 Japanese yen to a closing 131.07 yen. Later, in
London, it rose to 131.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Thursday's
rates, included: 1.8675 West German marks, down from 1.8710; 1.6048
Swiss francs, down from 1.6075; 6.3250 French francs, up from
6.3235; 2.1085 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,371.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,371.00; and 1.1938 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1965
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.7185 from $1.7210 late
Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $389.25 a troy ounce, up
from $388.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $389.25.
   In Zurich, the noon bid price was $389.10, compared with $388.60
bid late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.18 to close at a bid $390.52.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a bid price of $6.07 a troy
ounce, compared with $6.04 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>House, Senate Committees Ignoring Bush Deadline for Rescue Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is prodding Congress to swifter
action on his savings and loan plan as regulators prepared for its
eventual passage by taking over another 47 failed institutions in
five states.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. says it now controls 165
failed S&amp;Ls in 25 states after taking action Thursday in Texas,
Illinois, Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma. It hopes to assume
control of about another 60 in the next month.
   The agency is going into the sickest S&amp;Ls with the goal of
minimizing losses while the administration waits for Congress to
appropriate the money to shut them down or sell them to new buyers.
   Bush, in a luncheon speech in Houston, said Congress should get
moving. ``There's no excuse for delay,'' he said, urging legislators
to meet his challenge to pass the reform package 45 days from Feb.
22, when it was delivered to Congress.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, announced Thursday that his committee plans to act on an
S&amp;L bill by April 14 and is pressing for a full Senate vote by April
21, which is after the 45-day deadline expires earlier that month.
   ``We're going as fast as we can within the bounds of doing the
job properly,'' Riegle said.
   In the House, the subcommittee with jurisdiction over S&amp;Ls plans
a vote by April 14 with a vote by the full Banking Committee to
follow soon after. However, nearly a half dozen other House
committees are claiming jurisidiction over part of the bill and that
may delay a vote by the full House.
   In other developments:
   _Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the House Banking
Committee, said he will push to strip from the Bush S&amp;L proposal a
provision for the automatic reappointment of M. Danny Wall as the
nation's top S&amp;L regulator.
   _The Senate Finance Committee endorsed the nomination of David W.
Mullins Jr., one of the architects of the administration's S&amp;L plan,
to a senior Treasury Department post. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., said the full Senate could confirm Mullins as assistant
secretary for domestic finance as early as today.
   _An internal report of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,
summarized in a House Banking Committee memo, cited five examples
where S&amp;L regulators in Dallas may have given preferential treatment
to influential members of the industry.
   _Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., complained in a letter to Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady about efforts by S&amp;L regulators to sell
repossessed property in Europe.
   Bush, in his reform legislation, is proposing to wrap the bank
board into the Treasury Department, reducing the three-member board
to just its chairman. The legislation specifies that Wall, a close
ally of Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, senior Republican on the Senate
Banking Committee, would continue as head of the agency.
   Gonzalez, at a private meeting Tuesday of House Banking Committee
Democrats, said he would offer an amendment to the Bush bill that
would force Wall to be reconfirmed by the Senate.
   The bank board report on the Dallas regional bank was finished
last spring as part of the agency's peer review process, where the
performance of regulators in each of the 12 districts is being
reviewed by colleagues from the other districts.
   The regional banks are controlled by industry-chosen boards of
directors, although the boards are supposed to have no influence
over S&amp;L examiners and supervisors policing institutions in the
region.
   However, according to the banking committee staff, the agency's
peer review criticized the Dallas bank for five incidents
``involving what appeared to be preferential treatment of board
members.''
   Karl Hoyle, a spokesman for the bank board, said peer reviews
were begun about a year ago because ``there was a recognition that
the system needs to police itself and tighten up its operation.'' He
said the reviews are heeded and in some cases ``have resulted in
major personnel changes.''

possible court-ordered recall of 1.9 million General Motors cars
with an alleged cruise control defect that safety officials say can
cause drivers to lose control of the vehicles.
   The National Traffic Safety Administration took the last step
before a mandatory recall order on Thursday, ordering a formal
investigation covering several models of 1984 to 1988 Buicks,
Cadillacs, Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles and Pontiacs.
   ``The formal safety defect investigation has been opened to
prepare for a possible government-ordered recall,'' the safety
agency said in announcing the inquiry.
   General Motors has refused government requests for a voluntary
recall, the agency said.
   The safety administration said it received 144 complaints,
involving 18 accidents and seven injuries, in which a small plastic
ring which the manufacturer calls a ``servo bracket bushing''
slipped out of the vehicle's cruise control system at highway speed
without warning. The agency said this caused the throttle to stick
partially open. Cruise controls enable a driver to set a constant
highway speed without tending the accelerator.
   ``Under certain conditions, the driver may be startled and lose
control of the car, and the brakes will be less effective,'' the
agency said.
   Company spokesman David Hudgens in Detroit said GM does not
believe the cruise control allegations warrant a safety recall and
customers should ``continue to drive their cars with confidence.''
   ``Our investigation shows that if the servo bracket bushing were
dislodged, the braking system can still stop the vehicle within safe
stopping distances,'' a company statement said, adding that the
cruise control and steering systems are not affected by the
condition and no ``sudden acceleration'' occurs.
   The traffic safety administration agreed that the problem is not
related to ``sudden acceleration'' conditions in which the
accelerator suddenly goes to the floor. The highway safety agency
concluded last week that the phenomenon reported in the Audi 5000s
and other cars is most likely caused by drivers stepping on the
wrong pedal, possibly due to the way the pedals are designed in some
cars.
   The agency cautioned drivers of cars who experience accelerator
problems to turn off the ignition and steer carefully but quickly to
the side of the road, ``keeping in mind that power-assisted braking
and steering will be diminished once the engine is turned off.'' The
steering wheel does not lock on GM cars unless they are shifted into
park after stopping, agency spokesman Tim Hurd said.
   The investigation covers 1.6 million GM cars with five-liter
gasoline engines and 300,000 cars with eight-cylinder diesel engines.
   Models included are Oldsmobile Delta 88s, 98s, Cutless Supremes
and Toronados; Buick LeSabres, Rivieras and Regals; Pontiac
Parisiennes and Grand Prixs; Chevrolet Caprices and Monte Carlos,
and Cadillac Broughams, Eldorados and Sevilles.
   Clarence Ditlow, spokesman for the Center for Auto Safety, a
safety advocacy group that is often at odds with the auto industry,
said the problem is common in General Motors cars.
   ``We're glad to see they have taken action,'' Ditlow said, but
added that the manufacturer should voluntarily recall the cars and
correct the alleged defect. He said the center has passed along
dozens of complaints to the government.

<HEAD>Eastern Ticket Holders Can Get Refunds from Credit Card Companies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Trade Commission is telling Eastern
Airlines ticketholders how to get refunds for canceled flights if
they purchased tickets with a credit card.
   Commission spokeswoman Anna Davis said card companies are
obligated under the Fair Credit Billing Act to refund charges for
which services were not performed. A charge for a ticket canceled
because of the two-week-old Eastern Machinists strike would fall
under the legal definition of a ``billing error,'' she said.
   Consumers have 60 days after the first bill for a ticket charge
is sent to appeal for a refund, and Ms. Davis said it is probably a
good idea to apply even if the period has already passed.
   The commission, in a news release Thursday, recommended the
following steps for ticketholders:
   _ Send a written notice to the card issuer. Use the address
listed on your bill for billing error inquiries.
   _ Include in the notice your name and account number; a statement
that you are withholding payment, or requesting a refund if you have
already paid, because the bill contains a billing error; and a
description of the error with the dollar amount and reference number
of the ticket transaction as it appears on your credit card bill.
   _ Keep a photocopy of the notice and send the notice by certified
mail with a return receipt requested.
   _ Mail the notice in time to reach the card issuer within 60 days
after the first bill containing the error is mailed to you.
   _ Keep the ticket because you may be asked to provide it later as
evidence that you held a ticket on a canceled flight.
   Credit card companies are responsible for reimbursing billing
errors, Ms. Davis said. In the case of an airline ticket, the card
company would shoulder the payment back to the card holder and then
seek a refund from the airline for the canceled flight.
   Eastern on Tuesday announced a ``ticket holders assistance''
program which gives customers the options of holding tickets until
the airline resumes service on canceled routes or exchanging tickets
for up to 25 percent of the cost of a ticket on an operating Eastern
route until all of the ticket's original value is used up.
   As an incentive to get customers to hold onto the tickets, the
airline said they could be used to buy a half-fare ticket for a
companion if the canceled flight is resumed.
   Tickets will be honored by Eastern's sister airline, Continental,
and the company said it was working out arrangements with other
airlines.
   Eastern said it also planned to get other airlines, hotels,
rental car companies and non-travel retailers to issue scrip,
coupons or certificates for the tickets at their full face value.
   A final alternative would be to hold onto tickets until the New
York judge handling Eastern's filing under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws determines how much ticketholders will be refunded.

<HEAD>New Method Will Raise Long-Distance Rates, Critics Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission's
decision to change the way American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. sets
its prices is likely to mean increased long-distance rates for the
first time in four years, critics of the new plan say.
   The commission's 3-0 vote on Thursday to allow AT&amp;T to set prices
based on an inflation-linked index will reverse the steep decline in
long-distance rates that has taken place since the breakup of the
old Bell system in 1984, the critics said.
   The FCC claims the new method will save ratepayers some $900
million over four years.
   ``I fear that the days of real long-distance price reductions for
the average residential caller may be over,'' said Rep. Edward J.
Markey, D-Mass., who added that he would co-sponsor legislation
requiring close monitoring of the new plan to ``cap'' AT&amp;T's rates.
   Markey, who is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, said the FCC's plan
``does not contain sufficient consumer safeguards to ensure that
residential telephone customers will fairly share in rate reductions
which should result from new telephone technologies.''
   Since the mid-1960s AT&amp;T has been allowed to earn a set
percentage profit above its costs _ currently 12.2 percent. Under
this so-called rate-of-return regulation AT&amp;T's long-distance rates
have dropped 38 percent since 1984.
   Much of that decrease has resulted from higher prices consumers
have been paying to connect to local telephone networks. With
consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paid less to the
local telephone networks, and the FCC has forced AT&amp;T to pass those
savings along to its long-distance customers.
   The new price caps plan, which goes into effect July 1, will
allow AT&amp;T to raise rates to three percentage points less than the
rate of inflation in each of its three categories of service:
residential and small business; 800 calls; and other business
services, mainly for large customers.
   If the inflation rate were 4 percent, AT&amp;T could raise rates in
each of the three categories or ``baskets'' by 1 percent _ which the
FCC calls the price cap index.
   Within that residential-small business basket, prices may go up
or down for the six individual services in that basket _ daytime
calling; evening; weekend and night; international; Reach Out
America; and operator assistance and credit card calling _ as long
as the average increase for the basket of services does not exceed 1
percent.
   What worries critics is that an item inside the basket, such as
evening or weekend and night calling, may rise at the rate of
inflation plus the price cap index. So with an inflation rate of 4
percent, the prices for popular evening, night and weekend calling
would rise 5 percent, with other reductions bringing down the basket
average.
   ``It will possibly give you the first real long-distance
increases since the breakup of AT&amp;T,'' said Gene Kimmelman,
executive director of the Consumer Federation of America. Like other
critics, he says AT&amp;T has been trying to cut the discounts it gives
to evening, night and weekend callers and then lower rates in the
more competitive, business-dominated daytime segment.
   Prices in all categories within the basket also may not fall more
than 5 percent, which is designed to keep AT&amp;T from trying to drive
out competition with big price reductions.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said the change to price caps would
give AT&amp;T a profit incentive to cut costs and improve its
efficiency. Critics fear that service will suffer as a result.
   Others, such as Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., fear the FCC will
abandon the geographical rate-averaging philosophy that keeps prices
more or less constant in all areas of the country. Patrick has
maintained the agency will not change that philosophy.
   Cooper earlier this month introduced a bill that would delay
price caps. He said Thursday he would meet with Markey to determine
whether to continue with that legislation.
   AT&amp;T applauded the decision but said it was ``mystified that the
commission finds it necessary to continue treating AT&amp;T differently
by limiting our ability to reduce prices in such an extremely
competitive market.''

   Administration officials claim their new
approach to Third World debt could reduce developing nations' burden
20 percent over three years, but members of Congress doubt that will
be enough even if the plan works.
   Linking the issue to waves of illegal immigrants and tons of
illegal drugs entering the United States from Latin America _ as
well as the heightened political instability there _ both Democrats
and Republicans say they are disappointed the new initiative is not
bolder.
   ``I'm not sure that is going to be sufficient given the magnitude
of the problem,'' Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, told Assistant Treasury
Secretary David Mulford on Thursday.
   Mulford, testifying before House and Senate banking
subcommittees, described a 20 percent reduction in the $340 billion
owed by the 39 largest Third World debtors as a ``rough estimate''
of what can be achieved globally.
   He said some countries could do much better, depending on their
willingness to swap ownership of their natural resources or
industries to banks in exchange for forgiveness of some of the loans
or reduced interest rates.
   The new plan, unveiled last Friday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady and formally endorsed this week by President Bush and Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, for the first time calls on private
banks to discount their loans voluntarily.
   Whether the banks will go along remains to be seen. They largely
rejected urgings four years ago by former Treasury Secretary and now
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to increase their lending to
developing countries.
   Mulford, the chief architect of the new plan, said the first big
test will come when the banks try to negotiate among themselves for
waivers to provisions in many of the multi-bank loan packages that
now preclude them from writing down loans individually.
   Prior to that, however, the United States will get an idea
whether the plan will fly when the 151-nation World Bank and
International Monetary Fund meet in Washington early next month.
   Both Democrats and Republicans praised President Bush's
willingness to embrace the concept that private banks should forgive
a portion of the debt _ an idea brusquely rejected by former
President Reagan and his two Treasury secretaries, Baker and Donald
Regan.
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald Riegle likened Regan's
approach of emphasizing primarily investment-oriented austerity
programs in developing countries to telling ``people dying of thirst
not to be thirsty.''
   ``Secretary Baker put a glass in front of them and thought he
would be able to get water into the glass and it didn't work,''
Riegle, D-Mich., told Mulford. ``Now you've come with a glass and
with a concept that will put some water into the glass. The question
is will it be enough to address the thirst?''
   Senators from states with large populations of recent Third World
immigrants were more skeptical.
   ``In terms of a glass of water, I'm afraid we've been given
another rock,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla. ``We've been bombarded
with a series of small ideas on how to deal with this problem and I
had hoped we would hear a concept that had a breath of vision.''
   ``Many of the United States' most fundamental problems are tied
to this,'' Graham said. Among them, he cited increased drug traffic
because other trade is precluded and a ``staggering increase in
refugees'' from countries where a bulk of the earnings is devoted to
paying interest on the loans.

   In a bold move aimed at increasing Soviet food
supplies, Communist Party leaders have e
   The committee ended a two-day session Thursday by adopting a
long-awaited agricultural reform package that it says will eliminate
most food shortages by 1996.
   ``We are not promising something that we cannot achieve, but we
assure that we will be able to change the food situation for the
better,'' Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev told a news conference.
   Giant collective and state farms, onto which peasants were herded
by the millions during Josef Stalin's bloody collectivization
campaign of 60 years ago, will remain the backbone of the Soviet
farm system.
   But the reform is based on Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's proposal to give farmers long-term leases on the
state-owned land. Leases may range from five years to 50 years, and
may be inherited, said Vsevolod S. Murakhovsky, head of an
agricultural superministry formed in a previous reform effort.
   In an admission of failure, the Central Committee decided
Thursday to abolish the agency.
   Gorbachev has pushed the leasing idea hard since last year,
saying it is a critical element in solving what he views as the
Soviet Union's most urgent problem _ supplying people with enough
good quality food.
   In a dismal accounting of the Soviet farm system, he said
Wednesday that the food shortage ``creates social tension and
generates not merely criticism but actual discontent.''
   But those who take the risk of leasing land from their collective
or state farm often are regarded with suspicion and jealousy by
their neighbors and local officials, and sometimes forced out of
business.
   Ligachev, who once was considered the No. 2 Kremlin leader and
now oversees the party's agricultural policy, said leasing will be
accompanied by reliance on self-financing and making village life
more democratic.
   Distrust of especially prosperous farmers remains deeply embedded
in the Soviet countryside, the legacy of the collectivization
campaign when such farmers were branded ``kulaks'' and shot, starved
or sent into exile.
   Western experts say it may be hard to convince many Soviet
collective and state farmers to take the risk of striking out on
their own because of their neighbors' distrust and fears that
authorities could suddenly abandon the reforms.
   In contrast to the repression of Stalin's collectivization
campaign, no one will be forced to take up a lease, and the party
refused to set targets for leasing, Ligachev said.
   To set targets, he said, would be to invite Moscow to force the
reforms rather than to let them take hold naturally. That was an
unusual step in a system that has been geared for decades to
measuring itself by setting yearly targets.
   However, the party did set targets it wants to reach with its
reforms.
   The Soviet diet, product of a farm system dulled by mismanagement
and indifference, includes half the meat and fruit as the American
diet but twice as many potatoes and 50 percent more sugar.
   Ligachev said the party wants to bring the Soviet diet ``up to
generally recognized standards of nutrition'' by 1996, the end of
the next five-year plan. To do that, he said yearly meat consumption
should rise from 143 pounds to 176 pounds per capita.
   Consumption of fruit and vegetables should rise from 220 pounds
to 308 pounds, he said.
   Ligachev also called for better rural living conditions. ``If
peasants can't lead a normal life, society as a whole can't lead a
normal life,'' Ligachev said.
   Poor housing, education, supplies of food and consumer goods, and
transportation are causing a mass exodus from some rural areas of
the Soviet Union to the cities.

<BYLINE>Would Change How Residents Paint Houses, Light Barbecues, Spray
Hair</BYLINE>

   Residents of Southern California would have to
change how they paint their houses, light their barbecues and spray
their hair under a plan devised to clean up the nation's worst air.
   The changes are outlined in a comprehensive blueprint intended to
enable the metropolitan area to comply with federal clean air
standards by the year 2007.
   The Air Quality Management Plan, expected to be approved today,
is likely to touch nearly every aspect of Southern California life
for the next 18 years, said A. Norton Younglove, a Riverside County
supervisor and chairman of the South Coast Regional Air Quality
Management District's governing board.
   ``We're doing literally pioneering work,'' said Younglove.
``We're moving ahead of Congress, for example, on what they might do
to amend the Clean Air Act.''
   The regional agency devised the plan with the Southern California
Association of Governments, and the governing boards of both
agencies were to consider it at a meeting today.
   ``We've included as many things as possible,'' said Bill Kelly, a
spokesman for the air quality management district.
   New measures would restrict air pollutants in industries,
including electric power generating utilities, oil and gas
refineries, dry cleaners, furniture makers and auto body shops.
   District officials maintain that their regulatory approach is
fair, but the rules have aroused strident opposition among industry
executives and conservatives such as Los Angeles County Supervisor
Michael Antonovich.
   ``This proposal will destroy thousands of jobs, increase taxes,
raise consumer prices and exile businesses from our communities,''
said Antonovich, a dissenting member of the air management
district's 12-member governing board.
   Invoking a specter of Big Brother government, Antonovich said,
``If this measure passes we will have a new motto: `Use a barbecue _
go to jail.'''
   Once approved, the plan must be accepted by the state Air
Resources Board and the federal Environmental Protection Agency. The
plan's first provisions, however, could go into effect within a year.
   In big and small ways, rules set out in the plan attempt to
reduce the gaseous chemical stew permeating the air in Los Angeles,
Orange, Riverside and much of San Bernardino counties _ California's
most populous region.
   For example, one of the 160 proposed rules would require
metropolitan residents to forsake household aerosol sprays _
including hair spray and deodorants _ within the next five years for
manual-pump sprays.
   Another set of rules would reduce the reactive chemicals in
paints, coatings and solvents, making it more difficult to paint
homes and varnish furniture.
   Conventional lighter fluid would be outlawed in a shift to
electric charcoal starters for barbecues.
   Radial tires would be required on cars and light trucks.
   ``Radial tires last longer,'' Kelly said, explaining that tires
that last longer throw off less of the minute flecks of rubber that
contribute to pollutants.
   Such a rule may seem trivial, but not in a region where more than
12 million residents drive 8 million vehicles about 234 million
miles a day, Kelly said.
   By the year 2000, the exclusive use of radial tires would reduce
particulant pollutants by 3.1 tons a day, he said.
   Antonovich has rallied support among fellow conservatives and
several big labor representatives, who are alarmed about potential
economic impact.
   ``McDonnell Douglas cannot build airplanes if they can't paint
them; General Motors cannot build cars if they can't paint them and
Rocketdyne cannot build rocket motors if they can't test fire them
in the Santa Susana Mountains,'' said Tom Whalen, who represents
about 38,000 members of the United Auto and Aerospace Workers.
   Antonovich also cited a study prepared for the California Council
on Environmental and Economic Balance, which estimates the plan will
cost individual households $2,200 a year.
   Meanwhile, the Southern California Edison and the Western States
Petroleum Association have prepared alternative smog plans, which
they contend would meet federal standards faster and more cheaply.
   ``We have studied and seriously considered alternatives suggested
by industry,'' said James M. Lents, the air quality district's
executive director. ``They simply fail to attain all federal air
quality health standards as required by law.''

<HEAD>More Than 1,000 Workers Strike Bethlehem Steel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 1,000 Bethlehem Steel workers struck a
shipyard today after a last-ditch meeting with a federal mediator
failed to resolve a dispute over wages and benefits.
   Company officials said the strike could endanger the Sparrows
Point yard, which Bethlehem Steel said posted a $41 million deficit
last year.
   Strikers, who are trying to reclaim salary concessions made in
the early 1980s when Bethlehem Steel was on the brink of bankruptcy,
said the risk was worth it. Bethlehem Steel reported a $403 million
profit for 1988.
   ``It took me 37 years to make $10 an hour,'' said Ross
Caldarazzo, a sheet metal worker. ``I've got 37 years in, and I
won't get out with $500 (per month in pension benefits). They call
that a pension plan.
   ``We'll stay on strike as long as it takes,'' Caldarazzo said.
   Bethlehem Steel and union officials were called together by a
federal mediator Thursday afternoon but a two-hour meeting yielded
no progress, the union said.
   Workers on Wednesday rejected the company's latest offer by a
6-to-1 margin, following the recommendation made by leaders of Local
33, the International Association of Machinists-Industrial Union of
Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America.
   The three-year pact expired at midnight.
   Bethlehem Steel told union members this week that despite the
overall profit last year, the yard lost $41 million last year and
$30 million the year before.
   The union initially asked for across-the-board increases of $2 an
hour the first year of the contract and $1 an hour during each of
the following two years. But Murphy Thornton, president of the
shipbuilders' local, said the union lowered its proposal during
negotiations.
   Bethlehem Steel offered some wage increases but not enough to
replace wage concessions granted in 1984, union officials said. The
offer reportedly also did not contain pension improvements sought by
the union.
   Thornton said the last raise the members received was in 1983,
and that was followed in 1984 by a $1 an hour pay cut.
   Under the company offer, first-class mechanics, who now earn
$10.62 an hour with cost-of-living increases included, would get
raises of 85 cents an hour in the first year, 45 cents in the second
year and 50 cents in the third.
   Second-class mechanics who now earn $10.50 would see raises of 22
cents, 15 cents and 21 cents. Third-class mechanics would get raises
of 18 cents, 10 cents and 14 cents, Thornton said.

<HEAD>Alcohol Taxes Don't Cover Costs to Society; Smoking Pays Its Way,
Study Says</HEAD>

   Some representatives of the alcohol industry say
education, not a larger pinch of the wallet, is the way to curb
abuse and make up for heavy drinkers' costs to society.
   Their comments came in response to a study that found alcohol
taxes cover less than half the costs that heavy drinkers impose on
the public through auto accidents, sick leave and other expenses.
   The study recommends doubling the federal tax on alcohol, in
part, to serve as a deterrent to alcohol abuse.
   ``The real answer to alcohol abuse and any social costs
associated with it is education of the public, and especially the
young,'' said Gary Zizka of the National Beer Wholesalers'
Association in a telephone interview Thursday from Washington.
   ``In countries ... such as Sweden, where the
control-of-availability tactics have been tried, they have proven to
be monumental failure,'' said Janet Flynn of the Distilled Spirits
Council of the United States in Washington.
   Researchers writing in today's Journal of the American Medical
Association say smokers just about pay their own way.
   William G. Manning, a health economist who led the study for the
RAND Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif., found smoking costs to society
average 38 cents per pack _ just over the average 37 cents per pack
currently levied in state and federal sales and excise taxes.
   But alcohol costs society 48 cents per ounce, more than double
the current average state and federal tax of 23 cents per ounce,
Manning and his associates said.
   ``The contrast between smoking and drinking is that the drinker
sometimes takes an innocent bystander with him,'' said Manning, now
a professor at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.
   ``Higher beer taxes would make particular sense,'' he said,
``because it's the drug of choice for teens and young adults who
drive when they're drunk.''
   The research is the first to look strictly at the ``external''
costs of smoking and drinking _ the costs to society exclusive of
what smokers, drinkers and their families pay, the authors said.
   ``Previous studies reached markedly different conclusions,''
acknowledged Manning. ``But they often lumped both types of cost
together and didn't consider them over a lifetime. It's the cost to
others that is relevant in establishing tax rates.''
   The authors defined four types of external costs:
   _ Collectively financed benefits, such as health insurance,
pensions, sick leave, disability insurance and group life insurance.
   _ Insured property loss from smoking-related fires and drunken
driving accidents.
   _ Loss of life from such accidents.
   _ Alchohol-related costs in the criminal justice system.
   Non-smokers subsidize smokers to the extent that smokers' poor
health habits and shorter lives mean they pay less in taxes and
premiums than the expenses they incur in medical bills and death
benefits.
   But smokers collect fewer pension benefits, so their payments
underwrite non-smokers' retirement and nursing home care, the
researchers said.
   An estimated 2,400 deaths are attributed annually to breathing
other people's smoke.
   Traffic accidents killed an estimated 48,950 Americans in 1988,
and about half of those deaths were drinking-related, according to
the National Safety Council.

   Charges will be filed against whoever
introduced a banned pesticide into chicken feed, forcing the
slaughter of 400,000 tainted birds, a federal Food Safety and
Inspection Service official said.
   None of the contaminated meat reached consumers because the
presence of heptachlor was detected through routine testing before
the poultry made it to grocery shelves, inspection chief Lester
Crawford said Thursday.
   Authorities were investigating how the feed at Townsend's Poultry
Products in Batesville, Ark., was mixed with the suspected
cancer-causing pesticide that was banned for agricultural use six
years ago.
   Crawford said the pesticide was applied to a component of feed
Townsend's received and distributed to chicken producers.
   Townsend's, the ninth-largest poultry producer in the United
States, handles more than 23 million chickens each year for
producers around Batesville, which is about 90 miles northeast of
Little Rock.
   Since the pesticide turned up in January during routine tests of
chicken parts at a Campbell's Soup Co. frozen-foods factory in
Fayetteville, chickens worth $600,000 voluntarily have been
slaughtered, said Townsend's plant manager Tom Vanemburg. Two
million pounds of Townsend's poultry was stored in a warehouse for
testing, the Food Safety and Inspection Service said.
   Crawford said that if the Food and Drug Administration can find
out who first treated seed grain with heptachlor, prosecution is to
follow.
   ``We will always try to make a case, because this is an illegal
activity to add an adulterant to animal feed, whether intentionally
or unintentionally,'' he said.
   Checks during the last month at other feed mills around
Batesville haven't turned up heptachlor, Crawford said, ``but our
first suspicion is always treated seed.''
   The Batesville plant closed voluntarily for 11 days after the
contamination was discoverd.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Executive In England Charged With Theft</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British authorities have charged a former
executive at McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s international computer
subsidiary with embezzling at least $2.5 million from the company,
the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in a copyright story today.
   The executive, David Stears, was director of operations at
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems Ltd. in Hemel Hempstead,
England. He resigned last month.
   Stears was arrested March 6 and has been charged with theft from
the company, McDonnell Douglas officials told the Post-Dispatch.
   The St. Louis-based defense contractor, meanwhile, has filed a
civil suit against Stears in London's High Court to try to recover
money from him, said David Malaperiman, communications director for
the computer subsidiary.
   ``We are cooperating fully and assisting with the police in their
inquiries,'' Malaperiman said. ``Because the matter is still under
investigation, we cannot make any further comment at this stage.''
   The newspaper quoted a source who said investigators believed
Stears took between $2.5 million and $3 million from the company.
The source said the investigators believed that Stears funneled the
money from England to two interior-design companies in Orlando, Fla.
   Stears also is a subject in a grand-jury investigation in Orlando
of an interior-design firm that he helped found last year.
Authorities believe the firm, Montalbano-Lordan International Inc.,
and a related firm, Laura International Inc., submitted fake bills
to McDonnell Douglas. Stears in turn approved the payment of the
bills, said another source close to the investigation.

<HEAD>Boeing Anticipates Spending $1.1 Billion on Plants and Equipment
in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co. plans to spend $1.1 billion on
plants and equipment in 1989, a 63 percent increase over the past
year, according to the annual report of the aerospace giant.
   The report issued Thursday did not give any breakdown of the
spending plans, but Paul Binder of Boeing said, ``since we have most
activities here (in the Seattle area), the majority of these funds
would be spent here.''
   Boeing's plant and equipment expenses amounted to $690 million in
1988, $738 million in 1987 and $795 million in 1986.
   Earlier this week, Boeing officials announced plans for a $430
million expansion and overhaul over the next five years at the
company's Renton complex, where production of 757 and 737 jetliners
is being boosted from the current 19 a month to 24 a month by the
middle of next year.
   The report said capital spending this year will provide more
space and equipment for current research and development, new and
current programs and measures to improve productivity.
   Record orders have resulted in a backlog of 1,100 commercial
jets, and Boeing is boosting the production rate for the 767 and 747
as well as the 737 and 757. By late next year company officials
expect to be cranking out at least 34 planes a month.
   The annual report also confirmed previous reports of a 28 percent
gain in earnings in 1988 but contained a sour note in the form of a
$95 million loss in Boeing's military aircraft business.
   Analysts, many of whom had predicted lower losses, blamed
troublesome contracts, including one to build new wings for A-6 Navy
fighters.
   ``The A-6 re-wing project continued to be a major challenge,''
and company managers still face ``major technical and schedule
problems,'' the report said.
   ``They've got a real rocky picture there,'' said analyst Paul
Nisbet of Prudential Bache Securities in New York.
   Despite higher production costs and costly, embarrassing delays
in delivering new 747-400 jumbo jets, the company's commercial
airplane division logged $11.3 billion sales, a 15.6 percent
increase.
   Operating profits were $585 million for the division, the highest
in more than five years and an increase of 66 percent from 1987.
   Sales rose 37 percent to $1.45 billion for missiles and space
products, with operating profits rising by 4.2 percent to $124
million for the year.

<HEAD>Court Software Battle Points to Copyright Questions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court battle pitting Microsoft against
Apple Computer could highlight pivotal questions about copyright,
creativity and the future development of software for personal
computers, industry analysts say.
   ``The whole industry is going to breathe a sigh of relief when
this case is decided, even if the decision is unpopular,'' said
Kenneth Wasch, an attorney and executive director of the Software
Publishers Association in Washington, D.C.
   Apple sued Microsoft a year ago, charging the Redmond company
with copyright infringement.
   Apple claimed that Microsoft exceeded a contract granting it the
right to use the ``look and feel'' of Apple's Macintosh computer in
certain Microsoft ``Windows'' programs for IBM and compatible
computers.
   ``Look and feel'' is industry jargon for how a program appears on
a screen and is acted upon by the user.
   Microsoft, the nation's largest software developer for personal
computers, filed a countersuit saying that its contract permits
Microsoft to bring the simplicity and graphical look of Apple's
Macintosh to the IBM and compatible personal computer world through
Windows. Microsoft asked for a summary judgment dismissing Apple's
suit.
   Apple also names Hewlett Packard in the suit. HP licensed Windows
from Microsoft to develop a program called New Wave.
   Arguments in the case are scheduled to be heard Friday in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco before Judge William Schwarzer. If
questions are raised about the contract, the second phase of the
case would be heard in August.
   ``Right now Apple and Microsoft are speaking different
languages,'' said William Pope, senior corporate counsel for
Microsoft. ``We are looking at the same words and saying they mean
different things. We need the judge to give us a common language.''
   Apple had no comment on the litigation.
   The Seattle Times reported Thursday that underlying the contract
language dispute are more fundamental copyright questions, the
answers to which could affect the future course of software
development nationwide.
   What kind of software can be copyrighted? Who owns an on-screen
``look?'' What is an obvious programming technique and what is
infringement on somebody else's intellectual property? There are few
answers yet.
   ``These are pivotal issues in the industry,'' said Robert
Therrien, a stock analyst with PaineWebber in New York. ``Right now,
the legal status of who owns what is unclear.''
   The nation's No. 2 and No. 3 personal computer software companies
behind No. 1 Microsoft _ spreadsheet maker Lotus Development Corp.
and database maker Ashton-Tate _ are also suing competitors accusing
them of copyright infringement. Those cases have yet to go to court.
   Legal experts and the Software Publishers' Association see
dangers to the software industry in this litigious atmosphere.
   ``Nationwide there appears to be a trend that copyright and
patent protection is being used as a tool'' to protect market share,
said Esther Schachter, publisher of the Computer Law &amp; Tax Report.
   While that may bring short-term gains for companies, Schachter
said, the long-term effect on the industry may be devastating.
   ``We're talking about an industry in its infancy, which has a
great need for the maximum amount of freedom and creativity,''
Schachter said. ``Stifling that creativity may put a damper on the
development of the software industry.''
   Introduced in 1984, Apple's ``Mac'' computer is famous for its
ease of use, thanks to its copyrighted ``graphical user interface,''
or on-screen set of pictorial commands.
   ``What is happening now, is that the look and feel of the
Macintosh is being emulated all over the (IBM) PC world,'' Wasch
said.
   To most users and even software developers in the IBM world, that
is good news, Wasch said.
   Microsoft helped fuel the popularity of the Mac with a leading
spreadsheet and word-processing software. Now, Microsoft clearly
intends to duplicate its success on the world's 25 million
IBM-styled machines.
   The software that runs those PCs is called DOS, also from
Microsoft. Windows now gives DOS a Mac-like graphical user
interface. Microsoft says it sells 60,000 copies of Windows each
month, as many Macs as Apple sells.
   More recently, Microsoft and IBM have produced a newer version of
Windows called Presentation Manager, which is built into Microsoft's
and IBM Corp.'s new operating system, OS@2. Designed to
run only on newer, more powerful PCs, OS@2 is the heir apparent to
DOS.
   The new version of Windows means that if Apple wins big,
Microsoft and IBM could face a sudden and potentially disastrous
roadblock to bringing the ease of a Mac to the IBM PC.

<HEAD>Oregon Potato Growers Get Highest Prices In Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national shortage of potatoes caused by
last year's drought is helping Oregon growers get the highest prices
in years for their crop as the marketing season winds down,
officials say.
   ``We're shipping to processors in Michigan and California who
aren't usual buyers,'' said Will Wise, administrator of the Oregon
Potato Commission.
   ``We expected to see effects from drought in other states last
year and less acreage planted, and this is a manifestation of
that,'' Wise added.
   A U.S. Agriculture Department report last week showed a Klamath
Basin price of $12 per 50-pound carton of larger potatoes sized
70-90 per carton, Wise said.
   The price in the same week last year was only $3.50 a carton.
   Smaller spuds in the same area sold for $10 to $11.50 per 100
pounds, up from $4 a year ago, Wise said.
   The higher prices likely will drive up the prices of potato
chips, according to manufacturers.
   ``We can get all the potatoes we need but the price has about
doubled,'' said Simran Khalsa, chief operating officer at N.S.
Khalsa Co. in Salem, which makes Kettle Chips.
   The company plans to boost its wholsesale price 6 percent next
week and reduce advertisements and promotions, Khalsa said.
   Oregon has about 570 potato farmers who harvested almost 2.1
billion pounds last year from 45,000 acres, down from 2.6 billion on
55,000 acres in 1987.
   Low prices prompted growers to cut planting last year but drought
in the Midwest and Colorado caused the potato shortage nationwide.
   The shortage will encourage farmers to boost plantings this year
but high prices for wheat, hay and other commodities may keep some
acreage from being switched to potatoes, Wise said.
   Nels Iverson, who farms near Woodburn, said he will receive a
higher price for the 1989 crop he contracts to sell to chip makers
but he noted that inflation is boosting the price of chemicals,
fertilizer and other production costs.

<HEAD>Embattled Junk Bond Trader Gets Standing Ovation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Multimillionaire bond trader Michael Milken, who
is expected to be indicted for securities fraud, received two
standing ovations at a speech to the chief executive officers of
some of the nation's biggest companies.
   The address at Financial World magazine's ``CEO of the Decade''
dinner Thursday night was Milken's first public appearance in New
York since Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. agreed to fire him and
withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay as part of a plea deal
with the government.
   Milken, who technically still works for the New York investment
firm, did not address charges that include insider trading in a
Securities and Exchange Commission suit against Drexel that names
him.
   He made one oblique reference to his status when he noted he had
a cold. ``In the past two years I have been learning about rights I
no longer have. I was afraid they were trying to take away my right
to speak, but the doctors of New York have told me I will be all
right.''
   The 42-year-old financier has received a target letter from the
government indicating that he will be indicted on criminal fraud and
other charges.
   In a 30-minute speech, Milken said America's needs for the 1990s
include ``re-educating the last generation'' and motivating
students. He called for the appointment of more women and minorities
as company chief executives.
   Milken also defended a wave of management-led buyouts,
debt-leveraged corporate expansions and employee stock ownership
programs that have ``allowed employees to once again have a stake in
this country.''
   Milken received standing ovations before and after the speech
from an audience of about 700 at the black-tie dinner at the
Waldorf-Astoria hotel.
   Milken has headed Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., ``junk'' bond
financing department since the mid-1970s and is credited with
turning the high-risk, high-yield securities into a $175 billion a
year market. The bonds often are used to finance takeovers and the
growth of small- to medium-sized companies.
   Milken is challenging Drexel's settlement with the Manhattan U.S.
attorney's office of criminal securities fraud charges, which were
announced in January.
   Financial World named Wal-Mart Stores Inc. founder Samuel M.
Walton its ``CEO of the decade.''

<HEAD>Brokerage Chief Urges New Twist for IRAs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top Wall Street executive has begun a campaign
for a measure he says would stimulate savings without aggravating
the government's budget problems.
   William Schreyer, the chairman of Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., contends
that his idea would ``put some renewed sex appeal'' into individual
retirement accounts.
   At the same time, he says, it would help to pay in advance for
the future costs of health care and the well-being of the rapidly
growing numbers of older Americans.
   Schreyer's idea, put forward in speeches he has been giving this
month, is not to restore the tax breaks for IRA contributions that
were curtailed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 _ not right away, at
least.
   Rather, he is proposing that IRA savers be given the right to
withdraw money from their accounts in the future for certain
purposes _ medical, educational and home ownership _ without having
to pay tax on the proceeds.
   Schreyer's argument starts from the premise that the nation needs
to increase its chronically low savings rate if it is going to be
able to bear the costs of supporting an aging population in the
decades ahead.
   But he also acknowledges a more immediate need to settle current
accounts that are out of whack.
   ``The deficit crisis is real,'' he says. ``We've got to find ways
to encourage increased savings that take little or nothing out of
the Treasury's hide now.''
   Of course, Schreyer is hardly a disinterested party in the debate
over tax policy. When IRAs were opened up to all working Americans
in 1982, they became lucrative products for firms like Merrill Lynch.
   In 1987, when deductions for contributions ended for married
couples making $50,000 or more a year, and individuals with incomes
of $35,000 and up, the flow of money into these accounts slowed
significantly.
   But does his idea have merit? At first glance, at least, it looks
like a tax break that would benefit upper-income people the most.
Hence, it wouldn't seem to have much chance of attracting support in
Congress.
   However, supporters of the idea point out, the situation isn't
quite that simple. All IRA withdrawals, except for the amount of
non-deductible contributions made by the well-to-do, are now subject
to tax.
   So under Schreyer's proposal, all American workers would have a
greater incentive to put as much money as possible in IRAs. The
interest, dividends and capital gains that now build up tax-free
inside IRAs would remain tax-free when they were taken out.
   What's more, the accounts could be used to plan not just for
retirement, but for other goals Schreyer describes as socially
desirable, including education, and to help shoulder the burden of
the mounting cost of health care.
   But the idea raises several tough questions. First of all, what
would it mean for future government budgets?
   If taxpayers were able to build up large new amounts of money
that the government could lay no claim to, might tax rates on other
income have to be raised, and new types of taxes be created?
   Furthermore, would IRA contributors totally buy the idea that
their money could actually never be taxed?
   Recent tax changes have tainted principles that once were thought
to be sacrosanct: For example, ``no taxes on taxes.'' Well, state
sales taxes no longer are deductible and the deduction for state
income taxes barely survived the last debate about changing the
rules.
   Schreyer's case is that the nation should be thinking long-term
in handling its finances. As legions of financial advisers have
pointed out in recent years, that is hard to do in a climate where
the tax rules are subject to frequent and seemingly limitless
change.

   A new inflation shock rocked Wall Street today,
driving stock prices into a steep decline.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plunged 49.28 points to
2,291.43 in the first half hour of trading.
   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by about 9 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
108 up, 914 down and 303 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board reached 73.63 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The government reported this morning that the producer price
index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in February,
matching its increase the month before.
   That news came as a rude surprise to stock traders, who had been
expecting a gain of about half that size, and set off a new wave of
inflation and interest-rate worries.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, tumbled
about $17.50 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to take further steps
soon to tighten credit in its effort to keep inflatin restrained.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This situation prompts heavy trading by professionals engaged in
computer program strategies that involve both the options and
futures and individual stocks.
   Point-plus losers among the blue chips included Merck, down 1| at
64{; USX, down 1\ at 31|; Ford Motor, down 1{ at 49|; Exxon, down 1[
at 45, and General Electric, down 1\ at 45\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.32 to 164.78. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.65 at 328.87.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average had climbed 20.17 to
2,340.71, its highest close since it stood at 2,343.21 on Feb. 8.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 921 up, 510 down and 509 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 196.04 million shares, against 167.07

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two New York businessmen have denied
accusations that they cheated Coleco Industries Inc. out of millions
of dollars.
   Isaac Perlmutter and Bernard Marden are accused in documents
filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York by a group of creditors
involved in Coleco's Chapter 11 case.
   But Perlmutter and Marden said in court documents that all their
dealings with Coleco have been ``in good faith'' and ``without
fraudulent intent.''
   The two men have asked Judge Prudence B. Abram to dismiss the
lawsuit filed against them on Feb. 14. No trial date has been set.
   Coleco, based in Avon, filed for protection from creditors in
July, citing debts of $540.3 million.
   Perlmutter and Marden are together owed about $80 million and
represent one group, making them the toy company's single largest
creditor. They also are first in line to have their claims paid once
the bankruptcy matter is settled.
   The lawsuit was filed by a second group that includes
bondholders, manufacturers and advertising agencies owed a total of
$400 million.
   The two businessmen become Coleco's largest creditor when they
bought the company's bank debt from a group of U.S. and foreign
banks. But it is their past dealings with Coleco that has drawn the
wrath of the others.
   The creditors charge that Perlmutter and Marden cheated and
overcharged Coleco during the past two years through a complex
scheme involving the sale of the company' excess products in
exchange for television advertising time.
   Coleco often sold its excess toys to Beckman Group, a New York
close-out company owned by Perlmutter and Marden.
   The television credits were given through Admerex International,
another company owned by the two men. It specializes in buying
television commercials.
   The lawsuit charges that during a two-year period, Perlmutter and
Marden received $144 million of merchandise from Coleco and paid the
company $73 million in cash and $76.4 million in advertising credits.
   To use the credits, Coleco was required to pay 40 percent of the
cost of a television commercial and use the credits for the other 60
percent. So, $50.6 million in cash was needed to use the $76.4
million in credits, the lawsuit claims.
   The lawsuit charges that Perlmutter and Marden knew Coleco was
having financial problems and did not have money available.
Therefire, it claims, the two cheated Coleco out of $71 million by
giving the company worthless advertising credits.
   The lawsuit also accuses the two of overcharging Coleco $27
million for television commercials that the company did run in the
past two years.
   Coleco, which is not a defendant in the suit, said the charges
are ``without merit.''

   Senate Democrats moved to choke off debate
today on legislation to force federal intervention in the Eastern
Airlines strike, but the first test of strength was postponed until
after a two-week recess.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., made a move to short-circuit
Republican opposition while union officials appealed separately to a
Senate committee for changes in the federal bankruptcy law that
would weaken the company's hand in the bitter dispute.
   Under Senate rules, the vote on the Democratic attempt to advance
the legislation was put off until April 5. The measure, approved
earlier in the week by the Democratic-controlled House, would
require President Bush to name an emergency board to recommend a
solution to the strike and would impose a 26-day cooling-off period
during which the airline's employees would receive pre-strike wages.
   Eastern oppposes the bill, and Bush has argued that dispute
should be settled directly between the two sides.
   The maneuvering on the Senate floor came while union leaders
called on the Senate Judiciary Committee to allow Eastern's
creditors access to the assets of the parent company, Texas Air
Corp. The proposal brought an immediate objection from Texas Air
officials.
   Eastern sought protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy
code on March 9, five days after its unions began their walkout.
Negotiations to end the strike and an accompanying syumpathy walkout
by pilots are moribund, and the intensifying struggle in Congress
marked a new phase in the dispute.
   ``Bankruptcy has become a tool in the hands of people like Frank
Lorenzo to break their unions,'' said William Winpisinger, president
of the International Association of Machinists, whose dispute with
Eastern provoked the strike.
   Frank Lorenzo is the chairman of Texas Air and has been accused
by Eastern's unions of selling the carrier's assets to other Texas
Air subsidiaries to Eastern's detriment.
   Elliott Seiden, Texas Air's associate general counsel, countered
that the proposed legislation would threaten healthy companies
simply because they are partial owners of ailing subsidiaries.
   ``In the future, no corporation could or would consider acquiring
a troubled airline or starting a new airline,'' Seiden said.
   On the Senate floor, lawmakers debated another labor-supported
bill that would force President Bush to try to help end the bitter
strike.
   Republicans staved off Democratic efforts to consider the
House-passed measure quickly Thursday night, arguing that the issue
is so complex that it should be studied for at least a week by a
Senate committee. Bush has opposed the bill and his aides have said
he would veto it.
   GOP lawmakers made it clear Thursday night that they would use
Senate rules to block any vote at least until the chamber returns
from its two-week Easter recess, which begins tonight.
   ``I don't say there'd be a filibuster, but the debate will be
intense, and I think there are a lot of different views,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Under a filibuster, lawmakers attempt to use lengthy debate to
kill legislation.
   The legislation before the full Senate would require Bush to name
an emergency board to recommend a solution to the strike, and would
impose a cooling-off period of up to 26 days during which the
airline's employees would receive pre-strike wages.
   Bush has argued the dispute between Eastern and its unions, which
has built up over 17 months, should be settled directly between the
two sides.
   Supporters of the measure have argued that a presidential board
could present a proposal each side could agree to without appearing
to give in to the other.
   After hours of closed-door meetings between Democrats and
Republicans ended late Thursday, Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, tried to commence debate on the measure, arguing
that steps should be taken to end the two-week old walkout.
   ``The cooling-off period won't hurt. It will help,'' said
Mitchell. ``What would hurt is further delay and further inaction.''
   Republicans countered that more study was needed.
   ``To just ram this thing down on the floor. ... I think is just
rushing blindly into a situation where we might doom any potential
Eastern has to save itself at all,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
   The airline's 8,500-member International Association of
Machinists precipitated the walkout, and were followed by Eastern's
pilots and flight attendants.
   The House passed the union-supported bill by a 252-167 vote, with
all but 20 votes coming from its majority Democrats.

   Employee complaints helped prompt Grand
Metropolitan PLC to reinstate Pillsbury Co.'s director of
affirmative action at least until a company task force completes its
report.
   A group of employees called the Pillsbury Black Network, along
with the leader of the Twin Cities chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, had written to
company officials protesting the transfer of the affirmative action
director's duties to the human resources department.
   Grand Met, which acquired Pillsbury in January for $5.7 billion,
eliminated the affirmative action job along with 550 others at
Pillsbury's Minneapolis headquarters as part of a cost-cutting move.
   ``The thing that convinced management that this position should
be reinstated was really the employees' concern,'' said Mary
Carroll, vice president of external affairs for Grand Met's food
sector.
   ``One of the concerns the employees pointed out was that it was
fine to have a task force, but what would happen until the task
force makes its recommendations ... that was a major reason for
(the) reinstatement,'' Carroll said.
   Pillsbury spokesman Larry Haeg said today there has been no
litigation involving anything affirmative action-related at
Pillsbury, which has 67,000 employees worldwide, including 1,800 at
the corporate offices.
   Carroll said the affirmative action director, Jean Fountain, was
also appointed to the task force that will investigate how the
company should pursue affirmative action goals. Fountain's job will
be reinstated until the task force findings are in, ``and then we'll
have more to say,'' Carroll said.
   The company also will hire an affirmative action consultant to
work with the task force.
   Local NAACP leader Matthew Little said he is pleased with Grand
Met's willingness to reconsider its decision, and said it
demonstrates that the company is concerned about its impact on the
Twin Cities community _ a concern he said the community shares.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
today he had ``no hesitation in eating apples'' treated with the
chemical Alar, saying the health risk was minuscule.
   ``If you want to avoid food that has any potential health risk,
you're going to have a very narrow diet _ you'll be down to 75
pounds real fast,'' Yeutter told a meeting of the National Newspaper
Association.
   ``In my view the health risk of an apple that has been treated
with Alar is nominal, is minuscule,'' he said.
   The agriculture secretary's comments came as federal health
officials tried to reassure parents that apples are safe for
children amid conflicting claims about the possible health effects
of Alar and other chemicals used by growers.
   ``I have no hestitation in eating apples whether they do or do
not have treatment for Alar,'' Yeutter said. ``We ought not to be
frightened by actions of carefully orchestrated media efforts into
altering our consumption patterns,'' he said.
   ``I have five children and five grandchildren and I would not
hesitate to have them have these (apple) products now,'' Food and
Drug Administration Commissioner Frank Young said today on ABC's
``Good Morning America'' show.
   Officials from the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA
told Congress on Thursday there is no reason for parents or school
officials to stop giving apples or apple products to their children.
   After reminding a Senate subcommittee of the quick action taken
earlier this week by the FDA to get Chilean fruits off the market
because of fears of contamination, Young vowed he would do the same
for apples if he thought it necessary.
   But Young told the panel the FDA has never discovered residues of
Alar, a growth-regulating chemical technically known as daminozide,
in apples anywhere close to the minimum allowed by the EPA.
   In 800 samples tested since 1981 for Alar, he said, the highest
residue level found was 8 parts per million,. The EPA allows a
maximum level of 20 parts per million, he said.
   ``There does not appear to be a need for panic,'' he said.
   John A. Moore, acting deputy EPA administrator, said any
suggestion that children are gravely at risk ``is simply untrue.''
   Moore criticized the recent study by a private environmental
group, Natural Resources Defense Council, which suggested that
children may be exposed to dangerous levels of carcinogenic
chemicals in fruits and vegetables because they eat large amounts in
proportion to their weight. The study singled out Alar.
   Since the study, parents have reportedly been discarding apples
and apple products. School districts in Los Angeles, Chicago, New
York, San Francisco, Miami and elsewhere have stopped serving apples
in school cafeterias.
   Officials in Los Angeles said on Thursday that apples and some
apple products that have shown no traces of pesticides in tests
there are being returned to school district cafeterias.
   Although the EPA has acknowledged the link between daminozide and
cancer, Moore said Thursday he considers the health risk
insufficient at current use and residue levels to warrant its
immediate removal from the market.
   Nevertheless, Moore said, the EPA would reject daminiozide if it
were a new chemical up for approval now, and the agency plans to
seek its removal. He said that process could take three years.
   In a separate statement, the EPA, FDA and the Agriculture
Department said, ``The federal government believes that it is safe
for Americans to eat apples.''
   Despite that vote of confidence, the defense council reiterated
its concerns during testimony before the Senate subcommittee on
children, family, drugs and alcoholism.
   Actress Meryl Streep, a leader of Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits, questioned whether anyone knows the extent of the
danger from Alar and other pesticides on food products. She said
many of the older pesticides have yet to be re-examined using
current health standards.
   ``I think what we don't know about this issue is what's so
alarming,'' said Ms. Streep, who has three small children.
   Government and industry witnesses said growers have sharply
curtailed their use of Alar in recent years because of the health
concerns, even though its manufacturer, Uniroyal Inc., disputes EPA
claims that it is carcinogenic.
   ``The apple market is dead as a doornail right now across
America,'' said Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, whose family is in the
apple business.
   Thomas Hale, president of the Washington Apple Commission, said
after the Senate hearing that millions of dollars could be lost
because of the controversy, but that it was too early to assess the
economic consequences.

   Grain and soybean futures prices opened slightly
higher today on the Chicago Board of Trade, but just as quickly
trended lower in line with the financial markets.
   A 1 percent rise in the producer price index _ a signal that
inflation is rearing its head _ dropped a bomb on the stock market,
but should have been a boon for the commodities markets.
   Instead, after a short climb on the open, grain and soybean
prices quickly slid on a wave of local selling that some traders
attributed to concerns in the financial markets.
   Said one floor trader, ``The more the locals looked up at the
board and saw the stock market collapsing, the more they tended to
follow suit.''
   On the open, wheat was } cent to 3\ cents lower, with the

<HEAD>Bond Prices Dive on Inflation Report</HEAD>

   Bond prices plunged in their steepest drop of the
year and interest rates rocketed higher after the government
reported a stronger-than-expected rise in a key inflation measure
for February.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 2 points, or $20
per $1,000 face amount, at midday while its yield, which moves in
the opposite direction from price, climbed to 9.31 percent from 9.11
percent late Thursday.
   The previous biggest daily drop this year in the 30-year bond
price was a 1| point decline on Feb. 9.
   Traders scrambled to sell bonds within moments of the Labor
Department's report that wholesale prices soared 1.0 percent in
February, matching the previous month's rise. The gain was twice as
big as most analysts expected.
   Robert Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities
International, said the report was terrible news for the bond market
because it indicated inflation poses a problem despite the Federal
Reserve's efforts to curb it by pushing interest rates higher.
   ``Given what's going on with oil prices, we can't say we expect
good news next month either ... There is nothing good in this
report,'' he said.
   Inflation frightens bond investors because it erodes the value of
fixed-income securities and increases chances that the central bank
will encourage higher interest rates, further depressing bond prices.
   Brusca said he expects the Federal Reserve will respond to the
latest sign of growing inflationary pressures by encouraging a
steady rise in the federal funds rate, the interest rate banks
charge each other for short-term loans.
   Kevin Flanagan, a money market economist for Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., said his firm expects the federal funds rate will reach 10
percent in April.
   At midday today, the federal funds rate was quoted at 9~ percent,
up from 9} percent late Thursday.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments dropped { point, intermediate maturities were down by
between ~ point and 1\ points, and long-term issues fell 1| points,
according to Telerate Inc., the financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, was down 10.13 at 1,110.76.
   In corporate trading, industrials also were down. Moody's
Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price
movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or
longer, lost 1.47 to 297.15.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills jumped to 9.16 percent as
the discount climbed 15 basis points to 8.84 percent. Yields on
six-month bills rose to 9.45 percent as the discount rose 18 basis
points to 8.91 percent. Yields on one-year bills jumped 9.73 percent
as the discount advanced 22 basis points to 8.95 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.

   Shipments of Washington apples dropped by
152,000 boxes in the past week, a sign that some consumers have
stopped buying because of the Alar scare, an industry official said
today.
   The weekly report of out-of-state shipments of the nation's
largest apple crop showed a drop from 1.56 million boxes two weeks
ago to 1.4 million boxes last week.
   For the same week last year shipments were 1.5 million boxes,
said Bill DeWitt of the Wenatchee Valley Traffic Association.
   Based on the top price quoted Thursday for the three main apple
varieties in Washington, the loss to growers from last week's
shipment decline could be as much as $2.4 million.
   ``I'm sure part of this downtrend is the Alar scare,'' said
DeWitt, manager of one of two major apple shipment record-keeping
organizations in the state. ``There is no doubt in my mind.''
   Exports to foreign countries were down 35,000 boxes, from 173,000
boxes to 138,000 boxes last week, DeWitt said.
   ``That downturn is mostly Taiwan,'' he said, of the mass
cancellations of orders by Taiwanese exporters in recent weeks.
   The shipment figures are compiled by the state Department of
Agriculture from scores of warehouses across the state, and they
show the number of 42-pound boxes of apples purchased by retailers,
wholesalers, school districts, institutional customers and other
apple users.
   The shipment figures are considered an accurate barometer of
consumer sales.
   DeWitt said there was no way to tell how much of the drop in
shipments was related to a widespread ban of apple products in
school cafeterias, and how much was a drop in retail sales. Some
schools announced this week that apples would return to cafeterias
next week.
   The Alar scare was ignited in late February, when the non-profit
Natural Resources Defense Council issued a report saying eating
apples treated with the chemical daminozide, marketed as Alar,
increased the cancer risk in children.
   The apple industry has disputed the findings, and also maintained
that only about 5 percent of the crop is treated with the chemical.
   But the concerns raised by the NRDC were enough to cause many of
the nation's largest school districts to ban apples from cafeterias,
and prompted the cancellation of thousands of boxes worth of
Taiwanese orders.
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency, Food and Drug
Administration and Department of Agriculture this week also declared
apples safe for Americans to eat.

   Wholesale prices soared 1.0 percent in February
for the second consecutive month, the government said today in a
report that unsettled financial markets and shocked economists.
   Stock and bond prices plunged in early trading, with the Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks falling 49 points to 2,296 at
noon EST.
   The identical back-to-back increases, as measured by the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index, mean that inflation one stop
short of the retail level is running at a 12.6 percent annual rate
so far in 1989.
   That is more than triple the 4.0 percent increase for all of last
year and the worst two-month increase in nearly eight years.
   Prices in both January and February were pushed up by surging
energy and food prices, but the cost of other items, which are
generally more stable, increased at a worrisome rate in February as
well.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We are of course
concerned about any indications of more inflation,'' adding, ``We
also believe that the long-term outlook for inflation is that it
will remain low and under control.''
   The twin surges surprised analysts, who in advance of both
reports had predicted moderate rises of about 0.4 percent.
   ``It look bad. It's far worse than anyone expected,'' said
economist Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington forecasting firm.
``Based on these figures, no reasonable person could deny the
conclusion that inflation has worsened.''
   President Bush's chief economic adviser, Michael Boskin, speaking
in a television interview an hour before today's figures were
released, said, ``We want to remain prudent and vigilant against an
acceleration of inflation'' and urged Congress to act swiftly on a
credible plan to curb the budget deficit.
   ``We don't want to let that (inflation) genie out of the bottle.
That would be a bad thing and it would take quite a bit of work to
get that genie back in,'' he said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   Wholesale food prices rose 1.2 percent last month, the steepest
increase in 13 months. They had risen almost as much in January, 1.1
percent.
   Most food items were up except eggs, which dropped 15 percent
after rising 20.1 percent in January. Food prices were led by 35.3
percent increase in vegetables, including a huge 158 percent rise in
tomato prices.
   Energy prices jumped 2.4 percent overall in February, following a
4.9 percent increase a month earlier. The latest surge was led by a
4.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, the same as January's increase,
and a 1.9 percent advance in the cost of natural gas. Fuel oil
prices fell 3.1 percent, recovering somewhat from an 11.6 percent
surge a month before.
   Analysts expect little relief in energy prices in the next few
months as the vacation driving season begins. Crude oil prices, near
$20 a barrel, are at a 17-month high, propelled by the success of
oil-producing nations in controlling output.
   Wholesale prices, excluding the volatile food and energy
catagories, rose a worrisome 0.6 percent in February, up from a 0.4
percent rise a month earlier.
   Toilet paper, prescription medicines, books and flatware prices
all increased substantially.
   The overall February increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 111.7, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $111.70 last month. That
was up 70 cents from January and $5.60, or 5.3 percent, from
February 1988.
   Before today's inflation report, financial markets had been
rallying this week after the government reported evidence of some
welcome cooling in the economy last month.
   The Federal Reserve Board has been pushing interest rates higher
for the past year in an effort to moderate the strong economic
growth fueling inflation.
   The Fed has been concerned in particular about tight labor
markets, with unemployment at a 15-year low, and strains on factory
capacity.
   This week, analysts spotted what some thought were signs that the
Fed's tight money policy was beginning to bite. Use of factory
capacity eased in February for the first time in five months, retail
sales fell by the widest margin in a year and housing starts posted
the sharpest decline in nine months.
   But economist Allen Sinai of the Boston Co. said slower economic
growth does not immediately calm prices.
   ``There is a long time between when the economy softens and slows
down and when inflation, once entrenched, begins to recede,'' he
said.
   Despite the severe price hikes in February at the finished goods
level _ items such as bread and clothing, the index for earlier
stages of production indicated wholesale inflation likely will
moderate, at least from the pace set so far this year.
   Prices at the intermediate level, representing items such as
flour and cloth, rose 0.5 percent while the cost of crude goods _
commodities such as cotton and wheat _ dipped 0.1 percent.
   The Labor Department will report next Tuesday on how much
wholesale price pressure in February fed through to consumers. In
January, retail prices increased 0.6 percent, the steepest rise in
two years.

<HEAD>Newspaper: Trump Negotiating To Buy Unfinished Casino</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Developer Donald Trump is negotiating
to buy a long-dormant hotel-casino project that would expand his
holdings in this resort city, a published report said Friday.
   The Press of Atlantic City, quoting unidentified sources, said
Trump's representatives have been talking with owners of the former
Penthouse Boardwalk Hotel Casino project, which is located next to
the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.
   Trump could not be reached for comment Friday. His secretary said
Trump was not in his office and likely would not be available for
comment.
   Trump has tried to buy the Penthouse property in the past, but
was turned down by Penthouse. If he is successful, Trump is expected
to convert the project into a non-casino hotel linked to Trump
Plaza, the Press said.
   Last November, Trump sold Resorts International Inc. to
entertainer Merv Griffin and bought back from Resorts its unfinished
Taj Mahal casino complex here.
   A deal to buy the Penthouse project could be complicated by an
agreement between Penthouse and Pratt Hotel Corp., which planned to
convert the property into the Sands Hollywood Hotel Casino, the
Press said.
   The $55 million deal apparently also includes the site of a
proposed parking garage located one block away from the Penthouse
site. It remains uncertain how Trump could buy that property since
Penthouse bought it in partnership with Pratt Hotel Corp.
   William Weidner, president of Pratt Hotel Corp., told the Press
he knew about rumors that Trump and Penthouse officials were
talking. He questioned whether Penthouse would be able to sell the
property.
   ``We have a valid contract in place and I think they (Penthouse
officials) run the danger of some rather expensive litigation if
they try to do something other than sell it to us,'' Weidner told
the newspaper.

<TEXT>
   A federal grand jury has issued fraud indictments
against three former executives of an aerospace company that last
fall paid a record $115.3 million in fines for overcharging the
government on defense contracts.
   The three men were charged with conspiring to defraud the Defense
Department, scheming to conceal material facts and making false
statements.
   Sundstrand Corp. pleaded guilty in October to fraud and agreed to
pay a $115 million fine _ the largest fraud settlement in Defense
Department history.
   The indictments unsealed Thursday resulted from a continuing
three-year investigation of the Rockford-based defense contractor,
U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas said.
   The three middle- to upper-level executives were identified as
Joseph McCarthy, 53, of Rockford, a former division controller; Ray
John Chapel Jr., 46, of Reston, Va., a former division pricing
manager; and Ralph Hamann, 63, of Rockford, a former pricing group
supervisor.
   The three executives were all previously assigned to Sundstrand's
Advanced Technology Group, which manufactures electrical power
systems for military and commercial aircraft.
   ``Mr. McCarthy categorically denies that he conspired to conceal
from the government one of Sundstrand Corp.'s accounting
practices,'' said his lawyer, Henry F. Schuelke III of Washington.
   Chapel's attorney, Jack Bray, said the government has indicted
someone ``who was not part of the problem but part of the
solution,'' but declined to comment further. Hamann's attorney
refused to comment.
   If convicted, McCarthy faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in
prison and $1 million in fines; Chapel and Hamann could face 30-year
terms and $1.5 million in fines.
   Sundstrand spokesman Claude Vernam said the company was ``not
involved in the indictment of these individuals and they are not
employed here. For these reasons, it's not appropriate for the
company to comment further.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney William Clabault, who will be one of the
prosecutors if the men go to trial, declined to say whether the men
were acting on orders of company superiors or whether they have
agreed to cooperate.
   The government contended the aerospace manufacturer had
overbilled the government for aircraft parts; obtained some
contracts by underbidding actual costs, then attempting to recover
them through overhead accounts set up for other purposes; and
submitted claims for such things as babysitting expenses, country
club memberships and even servants for some executives.
   On Jan. 26, Sundstrand agreed to repay an additional $62.3
million to the Pentagon and make cost-saving concessions on future
contracts that one defense official estimated could be worth an
additional $34 million.

<HEAD>Fed Cattle Inventory Grows</HEAD>

   Cattle being fed for the slaughter market as of
March 1 in the seven major beef states totaled 7.66 million head, up
1 percent from a year ago and 7 percent more than inventories of two
years ago, the Agriculture Department says.
   The placement of new cattle and calves in fattening pens last
month was reported Thursday at 1.59 million head, up 15 percent from
a year ago and 10 percent more than two years ago. Officials said
the February placements were the most for the month since the
monthly seven-state records began in 1972.
   Marketings of ``fed'' cattle in February totaled 1.51 million
head, down 2 percent from a year ago but up 2 percent from two years
ago.
   As of March 1, feedlot inventories were larger than a year
earlier in California, Colorado, Iowa and Kansas, but were less in
Arizona, Nebraska and Texas. The seven states produce about
three-fourths of the nation's beef.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the seven
states. The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as
of March 1, and the second number is the percentage of a year
earlier.

<HEAD>Officials Plead for New Satellite to Avoid Disruptions</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: First 2 grafs new to clarify that money is for replacement satellite
in service since 1980. Picks up 3rd graf pvs, CPB President.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Public radio and television programming faces
serious disruption unless Congress finds money to replace a
satellite expected to fail in 1991, the Corporation for Public
Broadcasting said today.
   CPB officials, who also are seeking full financing of their
fiscal 1992 budget authorization of $265 million, urged a Senate
panel to provide an additional $143.19 million to replace the
satellite, which since 1980 has handled the public broadcasting
network.
   CPB President Donald Ledwig said failure to receive the satellite
money would ``force the public broadcasting system to divert scarce
resources away from programming and into satellite replacement.''
   He said that would ``seriously disrupt and adversely affect
public broadcasting's programming nationwide.''
   The satellite's useful life will end in 1991 when its
transponders, which relay TV signals to public radio and TV stations
around the country, run out of fuel.
   Congress last year authorized $200 million to replace the
satellite, but thus far it has appropriated only $56.81 million for
fiscal 1991 for the project, CPB said.
   The Bush administration has proposed freezing CPB's fiscal 1992
appropriation at its 1991 level of $242.06 million, with no
additional funds to replace the satellite.
   CPB Board Chairman R. Kenneth Towery, testifying before a Seate
Appropriations subcommittee, said the freeze recommendation
``directly counters the intent of Congress to fund CPB at levels
that reflect reasonable federal support for the nation's public
telecommunications system.''
   ``Dollar for dollar, the funds spent for public broadcasting are
the most efficient means of ensuring that all Americans have access
to outstanding educational, cultural and informational programming
and services,'' Towery said.
   CPB's request of $265 million in general programming support only
``amounts to approximately $1 for each U.S. citizen for the year,''
he said, adding that more than 100 million people watch public TV
each week and more than 10 million listen to public radio.
   ``Today, approximately three-fourths of all families with
children under the age of six watch and learn from public television
regularly,'' Ledwig said.
   He also said long-range funding is essential to public
broadcasting's ability to obtain the non-federal revenue that makes
up the 81 cents of every dollar the system spends.
   CPB is a private, non-profit corporation that was authorized by
the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 to develop non-commercial radio
and TV programs.

<HEAD>The High Cost Of No Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation is a nuisance, to say the least, but
would you really pay the price of getting rid of it altogether?
   If you say yes, you have made a decision that no president or
Federal Reserve chief has ever dared make.
   There is a very high price to eliminating inflation, or even
making the attempt, and whoever steers the economy in that direction
is likely to provoke his or her own good riddance.
   Inflation might have a bad reputation, but to some extent it is a
necessary evil in maintaining a strong economy. In a limited sense,
say some economists, it can even be a measure of economic
enthusiasm, vitality and intensity.
   Roger Brinner, economist at DRI McGraw-Hill, the old Data
Resources organization so highly esteemed by many economists,
recently accused the Federal Reserve of not having the courage to
eliminate the cussed curse.
   Brinner wasn't encouraging the Fed to pursue such a course; he
was merely stating what he believed to be a fact of economic life.
And to demonstrate this, he put some hypothetical numbers in his
computer economic model.
   He asked it:
   ``What unemployment rate would the Fed have to target in the
early 1990s in order to bring inflation to zero by 1995?''
   It answered:
   Unemployment would rise to an average of 8.6 percent over the
next five years. More than three million workers who are now
employed would be unable to find satsifactory jobs. Output would be
depressed an average of 5 percent.
   All this, observes Brinner, in order to cut inflation by four
percentage points relative to current rates and by five percentage
points relative to rates predicted for 1995.
   Such numbers clearly suggest why pursuit of zero inflation at
this time would be foolhardy: The gain would be minor, the damage
inestimable. For a president it would be political suicide, for a
Fed chairman professional ruin.
   The problem with attempting to erase ingrained inflation is that
it is bound to force unemployment higher and almost certain to
reduce output. While this might not be a law of economics, it is a
very powerful thesis.
   Simply put, says Brinner, ``the theory is that inflation will
continually fall as long as slack exists in labor and goods
markets.'' If that sounds innocuous, you may be sure it isn't.
   Right now, there is very little slack in either. Unemployment is
just a bit over 5 percent of the civilian labor force, a low figure
for recent years, while factories are operating at about 85 percent
of capacity, a high figure.
   When you reach those figures you are close to starting the fires
of serious inflation. Stressed, both markets react by pushing up
their price tags, i.e. wage levels and the prices of goods.
   To eliminate inflation, slack is necessary.
   ``The greater the slack, the greater the year-to-year decline in
inflation will be,'' says Brinner.
   The DRI McGraw-Hill model's conclusion explains to some degree
the adage that a lot of inflation is a dangerous thing while a
little inflation can be tolerated.
   Based on the current level of economic understanding, it is all
but impossible to fine tune the economy to zero inflation while
protecting the country from serious recession and political
explosions.
   In short, it's just not worth the effort. The price is too high.

<HEAD>UPDATES 4th graf with oil prices rising in morning trading</HEAD>

   Oil prices should slip lower in the second
quarter after a surprising $7 surge over the last six months, as
parties on both sides of the barrel adjust to a more favorable
petroleum climate, analysts say.
   The onset of warmer weather should dampen demand, which has been
running higher than normal this year.
   Moreover, the 13 OPEC nations might not want prices to rise much
higher for fear that such large non-OPEC producers as the United
States, Britain and Canada will be encouraged to start pumping more
of their own oil.
   On Thursday, the April contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark U.S. crude, finished at $19.84 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, the highest since the near-month contract
closed at $19.96 on Oct. 30, 1987. In early trading today, prices
topped the $20 level for the first time since October 1987.
   ``We're close to what I call a blow-off, which means we are ready
to set a top,'' said Nauman Barakat, vice president of energy
investments for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Barakat said Thursday he expects prices to top $21 over the next
few weeks before reversing and heading back toward $19.
   ``I don't think the market can sustain $20 for any length of
time,'' said James Steel, an energy analyst with Refco Inc. ``At
that price we will see more production from OPEC as well as Canada,
the United States and others.''
   ``OPEC has to watch out that they don't undermine their own
position like they did in 1979,'' Steel said.
   High oil prices in 1979 fueled by an Arab oil embargo against the
United States and Western Europe led to more exploration and higher
production by non-OPEC countries. Strong prices also encouraged
conservation, and demand for OPEC oil fell.
   Last October, crude prices sank to a two-year low of $12.60 a
barrel due to a world glut stemming partly from overproduction by
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In November,
after months of haggling, the cartel decided to set a production
limit of 18.5 million barrels a day to lift crude prices to $18 a
barrel.
   Although OPEC continues producing more than 19 million barrels a
day, the cutbacks have been enough to restore investor confidence
and spur demand among customers who had allowed their inventories to
dwindle, market observers say.
   Also, for the first time ever, several non-OPEC producers such as
Mexico and the Soviet Union have decided to cut exports by about
300,000 barrels in the second quarter as a show of unity with OPEC.
Problems with various oil producing facilities in the North Sea and
declining production in the United States also have contributed to
lower output.
   While production has declined, demand and prices have risen and
U.S. oil supplies have dwindled.
   Analysts said buyers had allowed their inventories to slip as
prices inched up, thinking prices would decline with the approach of
warmer weather. But that weakness did not materialize and customers
have been buying inventory to avoid possibly higher prices later,
Barakat said.
   A 48-cent surge in West Texas Intermediate on Wednesday stemmed
partly from an American Petroleum Institute report showing crude oil
and product inventories had fallen dramatically in the week ended
March 10. Heating oil stocks reached their lowest point since 1972,
due largely to a decline in U.S. refinery capacity and an increase
in Middle Eastern capacity, analysts said.
   Strong demand also reflects healthy economies in major producing
areas, including the United States, Western Europe and the Far East,
Steel said.
   However, ``there's not that much more demand to justify much
higher prices,'' Steel said. ``I don't see any pressure now, but I
think we will reach an equilibrium sometime soon.''
   Japan and some European countries already have lowered their
crude orders from February levels, analysts said.
   John O'Dea, manager of international energy futures at Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc., said that although strong demand and lower
output imply higher prices, $18 probably was closer to a long-term
price.
   ``Anything much over $18 a barrel, the (OPEC) countries will make
a pretty good profit,'' he said. ``But market share is also
important, maybe more so than profits.''

   The stock market took a sharp drop today as a new
inflation surprise rocked Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 47.14 points to
2,293.57 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by nearly 7 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
202 up, 1,375 down and 330 unchanged.
   Before the opening, the government reported that the producer
price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in
February, matching its increase the month before.
   That news came as a rude surprise to stock traders, who had been
expecting a gain of about half that size, and set off a new wave of
inflation and interest-rate worries.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about
$20 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to take further steps
soon to tighten credit in its effort to keep inflatin restrained.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This situation prompts heavy trading by professionals engaged in
computer program strategies that involve both the options and
futures and individual stocks.
   Losers among the blue chips included International Business
Machines, down 2] at 115}; General Motors, down 1\ at 83\; American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down ~ at 31~; Exxon, down 1\ at 44~, and
General Electric, down 1] at 45[.
   W.R. Grace fell 1] to 30{. The company denied rumors that
Chairman Peter Grace was planning to retire, which had led to talk
that the company might become a takeover target.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.12 to 164.98. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.44 at 329.08.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 174.15 million shares with two

   The Bush administration said today it would
allow Chilean fruit back on the U.S. market, ending a five-day
public health scare sparked by the discovery of traces of cyanide in
two grapes.
   ``With these and other safeguards in place we believe that this
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from
Chile,'' FDA Commissioner Frank Young told a news conference after
outlining a plan for stepped up inspections in this country and
abroad.
   Young said he had ``high confidence of detecting anything if
something was there.'' But he conceded, ``It is impossible to insure
100 percent safety'' and he urged grocers and consumers to make
their own checks when Chilean fruit reappears on the shelves in five
to nine days.
   The plan was announced despite a third poisoning threat received
by the U.S. Embassy in Santiago, Young said. He said he got word of
the latest threat, which was made today, a short time before he
announced the plan. He said the latest threat doesn't raise any more
concern than the first two.
   Young outlined the administration's plans for ending the five-day
public health scare after President Bush told reporters the
quarantine of Chilean fruit had been justified despite any economic
hardship it imposed.
   ``It has cost some economic hardship that I regret,'' Bush said.
   ``I think when the health of the American people might be
threatened you've got to take prudent action,'' the president told
reporters aboard Air Force One en route back to Washington.
   At a crowded news conference a few minutes later, Young said,
``We are now ready to reintroduce Chilean fruit beginning with
grapes, blueberries, raspberries and strawberries.''
   He said that since the small amounts of cyanide were found in two
grapes over the weekend, no additional evidence of contamination has
been uncovered. He said 13,000 crates of fruit have been inspected
since the two poisoned grapes were found.
   Young said Chilean fruit en route to the United States would be
subjected to increased inspection, and said the Chilean government
would take safety measures before allowing produce to leave the
country.
   He said fruit in some ships in port in Philadelphia also would be
inspected.
   But he said, ``Any Chilean fruit in the hands of importers...will
be destroyed to eliminate fruit that cannot be practically
inspected.''
   The discovery of the two poisoned grapes touched off a major
public health care in this country and difficulties of a different
sort in Chile, where fruit is a major export and where thousands of
agricultural workers have been threatened with the loss of their
jobs during the peak harvest season. The government has sent
high-level diplomats to this country in recent days to try and speed
a resolution of the problem.
   Chilean Foreign Minister Hernan Felipe Errazuriz called the U.S.
decision ``a workable solution.''
   ``It takes into account the interest of the U.S. citizens and the
Chileans, the consumers and the workers from Chile,'' he said at the
White House, where he met with Vice President Dan Quayle.
   Young dismissed questions about who would bear the cost of the
lost fruit and the inspections. ``The day I start to look at health
with regard to somebody's left hip pocket or pocketbook, then I am
not focusing enough in regard to safety,'' he said.
   In addition to the cost to importers, consumers may also feel the
pinch at the checkout lines. Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia
State University said fruit prices on supermarket shelves will rise,
at least temporarily, because of the Chilean scare.
   ``Most of what will be left on the shelves will be hothouse grown
(domestically) and that will be more expensive,'' he said.
   Young said the FDA would borrow inspectors from other agencies to
help with future inspections. He said that would begin with the
Agriculture Department, where Secretary Clayton Yeutter said he had
agreed to loan as many as 200 inspectors to help.
   Young said inspectors would examine 5 percent of the fruit that
arrives in this country from Chile _ a dramatic increase from the
normal 1 percent.
   At the same time, he called on consumers to conduct their own
inspections and look for ``injection marks, unusual appearance,
discoloration or chemical or almond-like smells.''
   He said Chile had already undertaken steps to ``eliminate
opportunities for tampering from the Chilean fields to the United
States.''
   Errazuriz met Thursday with Secretary of State James Baker and
called for ``swift action'' to avoid further economic and social
turmoil in Chile, according to a joint communique issued after the
meeting.
   The statement said 200,000 Chileans and their families face
``unemployment and even destitution.''
   The two sides agreed to address the problem on an ``urgent
basis,'' recognizing ``the danger to the Chilean economy and the
need to protect the safety of American consumers.''
   As part of an effort to cool tempers in Chile, the administration
has sought to assure Chileans that the sales suspension was not
politically motivated but rather was aimed at safeguarding the
health and safety of Americans.
   As Chilean fruit continued to pile up at airports and docks, the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration said a small team of FDA
inspectors was to be sent to Chile to check security on Chilean
fruit.
   Inspectors at ports in Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Miami have
examined 6,859 cases of grapes and nearly 4,000 cases of other
fruits: honeydew melons, nectarines, apples, raspberries, pears,
cantaloupes, plums, peaches, seedless watermelon, Juan Canary Melons
and blackberries.
   In Miami, Robert Aders, the president of the Food Marketing
Institute, said the entire food industry will be hurt by the
discovery of cyanide in Chilean produce and cancer-causing chemicals
in apples.
   ``The loss will probably be felt throughout the system,'' he said.

   Share prices plunged Friday in the worst single-day
loss this year on the London Stock Exchange, after the government
reported an unexpectedly strong rise in U.S. producer prices in
February.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index, which sank as
much as 49 points at midafternoon, recovered somewhat to finish the
day down 39.5 points, or 1.9 percent, at 2,073.1.
   Volume was 535.2 million shares, little changed from Thursday's
543.2 million shares.
   The report of a 1 percent rise in those prices triggered worries
that interest rates worldwide would head higher.
   The news hit a market already preoccupied by indications of
inflationary pressures and economic slowdown in the British economy.
   ``The first and by far the greatest fear is that international
interest rates have yet to go higher,'' said Paul Walton, an
equities analyst at Warburg Securities.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson ``has made it very clear
that if sterling weakens, and there are signs of inflation, he'll
jack up interest rates,'' in Britain, the analyst added.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended the day down 34.6 points
at 1,705.5. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 22.38 points to
close at 1,182.32.

   President Bush said today he has made no
decision on a deal that would enable Japan to build an advanced
version of the F-16 fighter plane.
   ``It's a good one to be sure you listen carefully to all sides
of...and that's what we are doing,'' Bush told reporters aboard Air
Force One as he flew back to Washington from Colorado.
   ``No decision has been made. I have not made any decision at
all,'' Bush said.
   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Thursday the administration
wants to go ahead with the controversial technology transfer
agreement involving the FSX warplane, which Japan wants to deploy in
the late 1990s.
   But, he said, ``there are at least three or four basic issues
regarding the agreement'' that still must be resolved.
   Fitzwater, speaking with reporters on Air Force One as Bush flew
to Houston for a speech, said a final presidential decision on the
FSX may not come until next week.
   He said Bush was reviewing documents and reading position papers
while on the plane. Once the president decides on safeguards, ``then
we would be able to announce that we are prepared to go ahead with
an agreement,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``What he's deciding are the terms of the agreement that we would
want to strike for the co-production of the plane,'' the spokesman
said.
   Under the U.S.-Japan agreement initialed late last year, St.
Louis-based General Dynamics would join forces with Japan's
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and co-produce the
next-generation fighter.
   Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal the
United States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition to
buying F-16s directly from the United States. They say the deal will
serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in both directions
while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.
   But critics contend the arrangement amounts to a giveaway of
advanced technology that Japan may use to help propel its civilian
aircraft industry into head-to-head competition with the United
States in the world market. They say Tokyo should purchase
American-made planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S. trade
deficit with Japan.
   Opposition to the aircraft deal within the administration has
been led by Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, backed by other
Cabinet members including budget director Richard G. Darman, U.S.
Trade Representative Carla Hills and Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins.
   Pushing for approval of the deal as negotiated with Japan have
been officials of the Pentagon and State Department, including
Richard L. Armitage, assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs.

<TEXT>
   A naval officer today denied a news report
that five Japanese ships were seized in retaliation for Japan's
decision to ban imports of Chilean fruit. He said the ships were
detained for safety inspections.
   On Thursday, Chileans ate grapes, apples and other produce in
defiance of a cyanide poisoning scare that resulted in the Japanese
ban and warnings in the United States and Canada that caused Chilean
produce to be removed from stores.
   Japanese officials said that only two fishing trawlers were
receiving a ``strict'' inspection by Chilean authorities.
   The Bush administration said today it would release Chilean fruit
for public consumption but said any produce already in storage must
be destroyed.
   ``With these and other safeguards in place we believe that this
program will provide the maximum feasible safety for fruit from
Chile,'' FDA Commissioner Frank Young told a news conference in
Washington.
   He outlined the administration's plans for ending the five-day
public health scare after Bush told reporters the quarantine of
Chilean fruit had been justified despite any economic hardship it
imposed.
   Since traces of cyanide were found in two Chilean grapes in
Philadelphia, tens of thousands of Chilean fruit workers have been
laid off and Chile has lost millions of dollars in export revenues,
Chilean officials say. Chile exports about 65 percent of its fruit
to the United States.
   Chile's foreign minister, Hernan Felipe Errazuriz, said in
Washington that 200,000 Chileans and their families face
``unemployment and even destitution.''
   Navy Lt. Jose Araya said in an interview with The Associated
Press today that the five Japanese trawlers were undergoing ``a
mandatory thorough safety inspection'' at three ports in southern
Chile.
   ``This is necessary for the safety of all people on board those
vessels,'' Araya said. ``Once inspectors are satisfied with the
safety standards of the boats, they will let them sail off.''
   He said he did not know how long the inspection would take.
   On Thursday, the official news agency Orbe quoted navy Capt.
Patricio Urbina as saying the five Japanese trawlers were ``seized''
in the ports of Talcahuano, Chacabuco and Punta Arenas in southern
Chile.
   It quoted Adm. Jose Merino, navy commander-in-chief, as saying:
   ``The Japanese have closed their market to Chilean fruits, so I'm
holding their ships.'' Merino, who is also president of the
law-making military junta, also was quoted as saying: ``None of them
is going to fish in our waters until they re-open the market to our
fruits.''
   But Araya said the ships were merely detained for safety
inspections and did not say the action was meant as a retaliation
for the Japanese ban.
   On Thursday, Pinochet made a surprise visit to a fruit-packing
house and said foreign reaction to the cyanide scare was
exaggerated. He ate several seedless white grapes to show they were
safe. ``They are very good,'' said Pinochet, who took power in a
bloody 1973 military coup.
   At rallies in Santiago on Thursday, Chileans waved anti-American
signs and ate the native grapes, peaches, pears, nectarines and
Granny Smith apples the U.S., Japan and Canada have urged consumers
to avoid.

combination of Pan Am and Eastern with employees' buyout; Picks up 2nd

<TEXT>
   A union leader at Pan Am Corp. said today he will meet with the
head of Eastern Airlines' striking Machinists union to discuss a
possible combination of the two airlines that would involve
ownership by employees.
   Meanwhile, strike-decimated Eastern told many of its remaining
workers to take time off without pay, and the chairman of its
parent, Texas Air Corp., hinted that selling the airline might be
his next step.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, told The Associated Press that he and Eastern Machinists'
leader Charles Bryan plan to meet Saturday to discuss strategy and a
possible employee buyout.
   Bryan confirmed he would meet with Genoese but declined to say
whether they would explore an Eastern-Pan Am combination.
   ``We're going to be discussing a whole range of subjects,'' he
said in a telephone interview from his office in Miami.
   Financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for Eastern is
financier Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World Airlines
Inc. The Eastern Machinists indicated last week they want him to
explore a possible buyout.
   Eastern, which once had 30,000 workers, told its 1,500 remaining
non-union employees Thursday to work 60 hours without overtime pay
some weeks, and take other weeks off without pay, as it sought new
ways to cut costs.
   ``There are not going to be any layoffs right now,'' said Eastern
spokesman James Ashlock. ``As we are now stabilized at this schedule
of about 110 flights a day, there's not enough work to justify the
amount of people on hand.''
   Eastern does not want to lose the employees because it still
hopes to rebuild, Ashlock said. But in an interview scheduled for
broadcast tonight, Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo said selling the
airline off could be more likely.
   ``It's possible that the most sensible way for Eastern Airlines
to proceed would be for some different types of ownership in some
way,'' Lorenzo told Barbara Walters for ABC's ``20-20'' show.
   Citing the planned sale of Eastern's profitable Northeast shuttle
to millionaire developer Donald Trump as an example, Lorenzo said
the deal would produce more than $300 million, and ``just the
interest on that $300 million is more than Eastern has ever earned
on the shuttle even in its best years.''
   Also Thursday, Eastern resumed jetliner service between Boston
and Washington, but Ashlock had no comment on reports that Eastern
was trying to hire new pilots it needs to add other routes.
   The company is operating at about 10 percent of its former
schedule of 1,040 daily flights. Ashlock said Eastern returned seven
direct round-trip flights between Boston and Washington to the
schedule Thursday, but ``the loads are not heavy. We have a lot of
seats.''
   Before Thursday, Eastern was offering only flights on its shuttle
service, between Boston and New York and between New York and
Washington, and some flights to Latin America.
   Federal regulations restrict pilots from flying more than 30
hours per week, preventing Eastern from returning to other routes
without more pilots.
   The Eastern pilots union, which estimates that fewer than 200 of
3,600 Eastern pilots have flown since the Machinists strike began,
predicted that Eastern's reported search for pilots would be
fruitless.
   ``I know they're out there trying to hire, but I don't know where
they would get them,'' said union spokesman J.B. Stokes.
   He said other airlines ``are offering better pay, better
conditions, certainly better management.''
   The strike began March 4 with a walkout by 8,500 Machinists
mechanics and ground service workers in a dispute over $125 million
in proposed wage cuts. The strike quickly escalated with the support
of pilots and flight attendants. Five days later, Eastern filed for
bankruptcy reorganization.
   Among other developments:
   _ In Denver, labor activists staged a rally Thursday to kick off
a campaign to discourage passengers on Continental Airlines and tie
up ticket lines. More than 1,000 union members and supporters
rallied outside the Stapleton International Airport terminal,
denouncing Lorenzo.
   _ In upstate New York, police said 21 members of the
Communications Workers of America were arrested for yelling at
passengers buying tickets inside the lobby at Syracuse Hancock
International Airport. Union officials said they only sang songs and
chanted in support of the striking Eastern mechanics.
   _ In Washington Thursday, Republicans used a parliamentary
maneuver to delay a Senate vote on a House-approved measure that
would require President Bush to appoint an emergency panel to try to
end the walkout. That could delay the vote until after the Senate's
two-week Easter recess, which begins Saturday.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission recommended that Eastern
Airlines ticketholders who purchased tickets for canceled flights
with a credit card appeal for refunds. Commission spokeswoman Anna
Davis said card companies are obligated under the Fair Credit
Billing Act to refund charges for which services were not performed.

<HEAD>Wholesale Prices Soar in February; Financial Markets Sell In Response</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 3 new grafs to UPDATE Dow average, bond prices. Picks
up 4th graf pvs, The identical...</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices soared 1.0 percent in February for the second
consecutive month, the government reported today, sending stock and
bond prices tumbling.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 leading industrial stocks, which
plunged about 50 points right after trading opened, was down 47.14
to 2,293.57 at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. That was off sharply from the
six-week high the popular market indicator had reached just Thursday
amid sentiment that inflation might be slowing.
   Bond prices _ a sensitive barometer of inflation speculation _
also fell sharply before leveling off. The government's bellwether
30-year bond was down nearly 2 points, or $19 per $1,000 of face
amount, at mid-day while its yield jumped to just over 9.3 percent.
   The identical back-to-back increases in wholesale prices, as
measured by the Labor Department's Producer Price Index, were
propelled by rises in energy and food prices.
   The increases mean that inflation at the wholesale level, one
stop short of retail, is running at 12.6 percent annual rate so far
in 1989. That is more than triple the 4.0 percent increase for all
of last year.
   Both large jumps had surprised analysts, who had predicted
moderate rises of about 0.4 percent. After January's numbers were
reported, economists dismissed them as an aberration and said
inflation would return to the 4 percent to 5 percent annual pace of
late last year.
   Wholesale food prices climbed 1.2 percent, the steepest increase
in 13 months. Energy prices jumped 2.4 percent, and analysts
anticipate little relief as the vacation driving season nears and
crude oil prices continue to hover around the $20-a-barrel mark.
   On Thursday, government reports on housing construction and
factory use indicated the economy might be cooling off.
   In its report on housing starts, the Commerce Department said new
homes and apartments were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate
of 1.5 million units in February, down 11.4 percent from January's
rate of 1.69 million units.
   Part of last month's decline was due to the weather, which turned
cold again after an unseasonably mild January. But analysts said
higher mortgage rates were taking their toll.
   Analysts said a longer-term slowdown in the housing market also
reflects the steady upward climb of interest rates.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said the nation's
industrial operating rate _ also known as factory use _ eased last
month for the first time since September.
   U.S. factories, mines and utilities operated at 84.3 percent of
capacity in February, down 0.2 percentage point from January, when
the 84.5 percent rate was the highest in nearly a decade, the Fed
reported.
   At the same time, the pace of industrial production held steady
in February after 12 months of steady advances, the central bank
said in a second report.
   The news was welcomed by those worried that the overheating
economy is pushing up prices. The closer factories get to full
capacity, the greater the fear they will have trouble producing
enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price
increases.
   Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson told reporters the
figures are ``consistent with the notion of some moderation in the
economy'' although it would be premature to say they signal a trend.
   The reports heartened traders in the stock market. The Dow Jones
average of 30 industrial stocks rose 20.17 to 2,340.71, its highest
close since it stood at 2,343.21 on Feb. 8. The day before that the
average hit a post-crash high of 2,347.14.
   Traders took the Fed reports as evidence that inflationary
pressures in the economy were easing, but analysts were cautious
about reading too much into one month's figures.
   Bond prices finished little changed in light trading. Analysts
said the government reports met the market's expectations.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 1-32 point, or 31
cents per $1,000 face amount, while its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from price, was about 9.11 percent, roughly even
with late Wednesday.
   Many traders remained on the sidelines, awaiting today's producer
price report.

<HEAD>Say SEC Wants Milken Fired Now</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has rejected a
government demand to fire financier Michael Milken immediately,
further delaying settlement of fraud charges against the investment
firm, sources said Friday.
   The refusal by Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph marks a
possibly significant roadblock in resolving civil charges, and could
complicate resolution of criminal charges stemming from a two-year
federal investigation into one of Wall Street's biggest and most
profitable companies.
   Drexel already has agreed to government demands to axe Milken,
withhold his multimillion-dollar 1988 pay and bar him from ever
speaking with members of the firm about any business matters.
   But the latest request by the Securities and Exchange Commission
would require the 42-year-old financier to immediately leave the
firm, which he helped develop into the leader in the high-yield
``junk'' bond market.
   Milken, who has emerged as a leading figure in a federal campaign
against securities abuses, is expected to be charged with a range of
fraud and racketeering charges. He has denied wrongdoing and has
been working part-time at Drexel's Beverly Hills, Calif., office
while preparing his defense.
   Sources who have direct knowledge of the settlement negotiations
said SEC enforcement director Gary Lynch made the new demand during
talks earlier this week. Joseph told Lynch the firm wouldn't do it,
said the sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified.
   ``Lynch told Fred Joseph they need to fire Michael prior to any
settlement being signed and agreed to by the SEC,'' said one source.
   ``The thinking by the SEC is that if (Drexel) does that then
Milken has less of a case because they're not mandating'' his
firing, the source said.
   Firing Milken would not be a written provision of the settlement
with the SEC, the source said.
   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder declined to comment on any part
of the negotiations as did a spokesman for Milken. SEC spokeswoman
Mary McCue also refused to comment.
   Drexel already has conceded to terminating Milken as part of a
deal settling criminal charges with the Manhattan U.S. attorney's
office reached in December. Drexel also agreed to plead guilty to
six felony counts and pay a record $650 million in fines and
restitution.
   Milken has asked a federal judge to reject or modify the pact,
which cannot be approved by a federal judge until the SEC deal is
completed. His lawyers say firing him and withholding earned
compensation denies him his legal rights.
   The SEC is said to want Milken ousted immediately regardless of
his legal challenge to the criminal settlement, on grounds that all
employees that the agency believes are responsible for illegal
activities should be purged.
   Sources said the government also wants to insure that Milken is
fired because his legal challenge may take months to resolve and he
could remain at the firm indefinitely.

   Soybean futures prices closed mostly higher, but
wheat and corn ended mixed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Because inflationary developments are viewed as favorable to
commodity prices, most traders expected the government's report of a
strong 1 percent rise in the producer price index would prove a boon
for the futures markets.
   Instead, after a short climb on the opening, prices in all three
pits quickly slid on a wave of selling that some traders attributed
to concerns in the financial markets where stocks and bonds fell
sharply.
   Wheat stayed in a narrow range all day as the market split on
conflicting forecasts of how much rain will hit the winter wheat
areas of the Plains this weekend.
   Soybeans, however, made a stunning recovery _ 15 cents on some
contracts _ on late buying by professional and commission houses
either covering short positions or squaring up for the weekend.
   ``There was no fresh news, but the same people who were selling
the market early turned out to be the ones who bought it late,''
said Vic Lespinasse, a floor trader for Dean Witter Reynolds.
   On the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to } cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.34 a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to { cent higher, with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were }

soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6} cents higher, with March at $7.69{

<HEAD>Foreigners' Share of U.S. Patents Continues to Rise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The share of U.S. patents issued to foreigners
continued to grow in 1988, the Commerce Department said Friday.
   The department's Patent and Trademark Office said it issued
84,272 patents last year, of which 47.1 percent were granted to
foreigners, up from 46.6 percent in 1987.
   Overall, the number of patents issued last year was down 5.7 from
1987.
   Japanese inventors kept the lead, receiving 16,984 of the patents
issued, down from 17,288 in 1987.
   West Germany remained a distant second, claiming 7,501 patents
last year, down from 8,030 in 1987.
   The percentage of U.S. patents obtained by foreigners has more
the doubled in the past 25 years. It reached the 20 percent level in
1966 and has increased each year since then.
   Patents and Trademarks Commissioner Donald J. Quigg said his
office is trying to counter that trend through an outreach program
``aimed at teaching students to think analytically.''
   ``I only hope our efforts to rekindle the spirit of invention are
not too late,'' Quigg said.
   Under international agreements, foreign residents may obtain U.S.
patents under the same terms as U.S. citizens. Americans are treated
in a similar fashion by foreign patent offices.
   Of the 44,570 patents issued to U.S. residents last year,
Californians claimed the most, at 6,875.
   Here are figures for the top 10 foreign countries in receipts of
patents last year: Japan, 16,984; West Germany, 7,501; France,
2,792; United Kingdom, 2,756; Switzerland, 1,298; Italy, 1,172;
Netherlands, 899; Sweden, 891; Taiwan, 536, and Australia, 486.
   Here are figures for the top 10 states in receipts of patents
last year: California, 6,875; New York, 3,647; New Jersey, 2,777;
Illinois, 2,612; Pennsylvania, 2,560; Texas, 2,540; Ohio, 2,376;
Michigan, 2,312; Massachusetts, 1,786, and Florida, 1,508.

   The stock market took a pounding today as a new
inflation surprise rocked Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 56.96 points to
2,283.75 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Declining issues overwhelmed advances by more than 6 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
221 up, 1,389 down and 334 unchanged.
   Before the opening, the government reported that the producer
price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in
February, matching its increase the month before.
   That news came as a rude surprise to stock traders, who had been
expecting a gain of about half that size, and set off a new wave of
inflation and interest-rate worries.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about
$20 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to take further steps
soon to tighten credit in its effort to keep inflatin restrained.
   Late in the session, the market was hit with another jolt when
International Business Machines, the No. 1 holding of investing
institutions, said its first-quarter earnings would fall short of
analysts' expectations.
   IBM shares fell 4{ to 113|.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This situation prompts heavy trading by professionals engaged in
computer program strategies that involve both the options and
futures and individual stocks.
   Aside from IBM, losers among the blue chips included American
Express, down ~ at 29~; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1 at
31}; Exxon, down 1] at 44}, and General Electric, down 1{ at 45.
   W.R. Grace fell 1] to 30{. The company denied rumors that
Chairman Peter Grace was planning to retire, which had led to talk
that the company might become a takeover target.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.64 to 164.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 3.55 at 328.97.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 196.50 million shares with an
hour to go.

   Southern Progress Corp. announced Friday
the purchase of controlling interest in the 3-year-old Southern
magazine.
   Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   The magazine's publisher, Alan Leveritt, said he had been
notified that the Little Rock, Ark., magazine was being purchased by
Birmingham-based Southern Living magazine and that Southern will be
moving to Birmingham.
   Leveritt said he would have preferred not to sell the magazine
``but they made our financiers a very generous offer and they have a
right to sell when they get a good offer.''
   He said Southern was to made its first profit this quarter.
   Leveritt had said earlier this week that negotiations were under
way for the sale of Southern, which has 20 employees and a
circulation of about 275,000, to Southern Progress Corp., a Time
Inc. subsidiary which publishes Southern Living and other regional
magazines.
   Southern Progress said Friday its agreement with Stephens Inc. of
Little Rock, the magazine's principal stockholder, calls for
Southern Progress to have a 70 percent interest in the partnership
and to be the managing general partner.
   ``We will have a minority interest in the magazine but we have no
control,'' Leveritt said. ``They (Southern Living) are making no
commitments on employing anyone at Southern magazine. I think
Southern Progress is an excellent company and that they are going to
do a good job with it and we wish them well.''
   Don Logan, chief executive officer of Southern Progress, said
combined issues of Southern will be published in May-June and
July-August to give more time to formulate an editorial strategy for
the magazine.
   ``We will announce more specific details about our editorial
plans in the next few weeks,'' he said.

   A new inflation surprise jolted Wall Street
today, driving the stock market into its sharpest decline in nearly
a year.
   Before the opening, the government reported that the producer
price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in
February, matching its increase the month before.
   That news came as a rude shock to stock traders, who had been
expecting a gain of about half that size, and set off a new wave of
inflation and interest-rate worries.
   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about
$20 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to take further steps
soon to tighten credit in its effort to keep inflatin restrained.
   Late in the session, the market was hit with another setback when
International Business Machines, the No. 1 holding of investing
institutions, said its first-quarter earnings would fall short of
analysts' expectations.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This situation prompts heavy trading by professionals engaged in
computer program strategies that involve both the options and
futures and individual stocks.

   The world's biggest futures exchanges
traded jabs Friday while pitching competing electronic trading
systems to hundreds of brokerages, but brokers said they want to use
the systems before expressing a preference.
   The systems are key elements in plans by both the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade to compete against
foreign exchanges for around-the-clock trading in the increasingly
globalized commodities markets.
   The systems also are seen as helping to monitor trading practices
that are object of an ongoing federal probe into alleged fraud and
other abuses in the Chicago futures markets.
   Both would replace the traditional open-outcry trading system, in
which traders crammed into pits on exchange floors make buy and sell
deals via hand signals and shouts.
   The Board of Trade's proposed Aurora system and the Globex system
being developed by the Merc and London-based Reuters Holdings PLC
differ in the way they look on computer screens _ Aurora resembles a
video game while Globex looks like a financial spreadsheet.
   The Merc has touted the development of Globex for some time,
while the Board of Trade _ formerly a critic of electronic trading _
only recently revealed that it planned its own electronic system.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's
executive committee, referred to the Chicago Board of Trade as a
``Johnny-come-lately'' to electronic trading. Board of Trade board
member Burt Gutterman alluded to the Merc's system as ``bombarding''
users with information.
   Some of the brokers who attended both presentations at the
Futures Industry Association's annual convention said they could not
express a preference until they have worked with both systems.
Neither system will be operational until this fall.
   ``If there was one system, or if there was some standardization,
that would be desirable,'' said John Conheeney, chairman of Merrill
Lynch Futures Inc.
   ``But apparently from what we've seen so far, that's not going to
happen.''
   Before the 1970s, futures markets traded only commodities, such
as gold, wheat or frozen concentrated orange juice. But the Chicago
Merc's first successful introduction of financial instrument
contracts such as Treasury bill futures in 1972 revolutionized the
industry and attracted investors from around the globe.
   The Chicago exchanges, which lead the world in financial futures
volume, want to make their markets accessible to investors in Europe
and Asia when their own trading floors are closed at night.
   All orders to buy and sell U.S. futures contracts now are
executed by open-outcry trading.
   The Board of Trade, which commands about half of all U.S. futures
volume, launched an evening trading session about two years ago in a
largely successful effort to give Japanese investors easier access
to its popular U.S. Treasury bond contract.
   The Merc, which trades foreign currency and stock-index futures,
announced plans to develop Globex in September 1987. At that time,
the Board of Trade criticized electronic trading, saying it could be
easily abused and would never match the efficiency of open-outcry
trading.
   But in early February of this year, the Board of Trade revealed
that it was working on its own computerized trading system. The
Board of Trade now says it had Aurora under development even while
it was criticizing Globex.
   But many industry observers believe Aurora is a response to the
January disclosure of a federal investigation of trading fraud at
the Chicago exchanges.
   The probe has raised questions about record-keeping by pit
traders. Record-keeping would be done by computers in an electronic
trading system, theoretically making it easier to detect cheating.
   Melamed recalled the Board of Trade's reversal on Friday and
alluded to its claim that Aurora, with its electronic replication of
a futures pit, is superior to Globex.
   ``Now come those critics again, those Johnny-come-latelys and
tell us, `Well, maybe it was a good idea after all but the
technology is all wrong,''' Melamed said.
   ``Globex, they say, is not like open-outcry. You bet it is not,''
Melamed said. ``While we recognize the value of open-outcry...it is
simply not the only, or last, or even the best answer to the world's
needs.''
   Melamed said Globex, which matches buy and sell orders
anonymously, evens the odds for small traders, thus improving on the
open-outcry system.
   Board of Trade officials emphasized Aurora's video game-like
display, which they hope will appeal to off-the-floor traders and
brokers who watch Globex-like price-quote screens all day.
   ``This protects the user from being bombarded with alphanumeric
symbols,'' said Gutterman.

   The stock market took its sharpest drop in nearly
a year Friday as a new surprise on inflation jolted Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 48.57 to 2,292.14,
for its biggest point decline since it tumbled 101.46 last April 14.
   That all but wiped out strong gains recorded earlier in the week,
leaving the average with a net increase of 10 points from the
previous Friday's close.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by almost 7 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached an eight-week high
of 242.90 million shares, against 196.04 million Thursday.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 278.31 million shares.
   Before the opening, the government reported that the producer
price index of finished goods rose a full percentage point in
February, matching its increase the month before.
   That news came as a rude shock to stock traders, who had been
expecting a gain of about half that size, and set off a new wave of

   In the credit markets, prices of long-term government bonds,
which move in the opposite direction from interest rates, fell about
$17.50 for each $1,000 in face value.
   Conjecture immediately began to spread in the financial world
that the Federal Reserve would feel compelled to take further steps
soon to tighten credit in its effort to keep inflatin restrained.
   Late in the session, the market was hit with another setback when
International Business Machines, the No. 1 holding of investing

   IBM shares fell 5| to 112{.
   The intensity of activity in the stock market was heightened by
the so-called ``triple witching hour,'' a quarterly occasion when
the last trading occurs in a set of expiring options and futures on
stock indexes.
   This circumstance prompts heavy trading by professionals engaged
in computer program strategies that involve both the options and
futures and individual stocks.
   In Friday's case, these program traders appeared to help the
market recover slightly by buying stocks at the close. At its worst
levels of the day the Dow was down more than 60 points.
   Aside from IBM, losers among the blue chips included Ford Motor,
down 1\ at 49~; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down } at 32; Exxon,
down 1 at 45, and General Electric, down 1| at 44~.
   W.R. Grace fell 1] to 30{. The company denied rumors that
Chairman Peter Grace was planning to retire, which had led to talk
that the company might become a takeover target.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $58.28 billion, or 1.97
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.45 to 164.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 8.23 to 337.78, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 6.75 at 292.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 7.32 to 402.19. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 328.36, down 4.16.

   A sharp stock market sell-off sparked by renewed
inflation fears Friday triggered futures trading limits aimed at
preventing another market crash.
   The price limits on stock-index futures trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange were used for the first time since being imposed
last year by major financial markets.
   Sparking the trading frenzy was the Labor Department's report of
a larger-than-expected increase in February's producer prices.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials plummeted about 50 points
on the opening and held at lower levels throughout the day as a new
wave of inflation fears and worries that the Federal Reserve would
boost interest rates rippled through the market.
   The Dow industrials finished down 48.57 points at 2,292.14.
   Last October, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved a series of so-called
``circuit-breaker'' measures designed to calm jittery, volatile
markets and prevent a repeat of the Black Monday crash of Oct. 19,
1987.
   Many critics blamed the effect of computerized strategies
involving simultaneous trading of stocks and stock index futures for
worsening the Black Monday crash, when the Dow Jones average fell
508 points.
   As a result, regulators approved plans to limit trading when it
appeared that sharp price movements in the futures markets _ where
stock index futures are traded _ might spark ensuing plunges in the
stock market.
   Part of the plan stipulates that S&amp;P 500 futures price movements
be limited for 30 minutes once the S&amp;P 500 contract drops 12 points,
to give the markets a cooling-off period. Such a decline is
equivalent to roughly a 100-point drop in the Dow industrials.
   On Friday, a separate five-point price limit on the S&amp;P 500
contract was in effect for the first 10 minutes of trading, when
traders sold off the contract following the inflation report.
   Merc officials and the New York Stock Exchange conferred by phone
during the opening limit, the Merc said in a statement issued after
the market close. The Merc said the S&amp;P 500 limit coordinated ``an
orderly opening'' and noted that the markets continued to trade
normally afterward.
   Although the plunge in the Dow was noteworthy, it came nowhere
near the 250-point drop required to temporarily suspend stock market
trading under the circuit breaker plan. Trading on the major U.S.
exchanges would be halted for an hour on days when the Dow drops 250
points.
   If there is an additional 150-point plunge, for a total of 400
points in a single day, a second circuit breaker would impose an
additional two-hour halt.
   Stock market activity also was intensified somewhat on Friday by
the triple witching hour, the quarterly, simultaneous expiration of
options and futures on stock indexes.
   This situation often prompts abnormally heavy trading by
professionals engaged in complicated strategies involving trading of
both the options and futures and the individual stocks.

   Placing undercover regulatory police on
the trading floors of futures exchanges sounds ``invasive'' but they
may be needed to help curb trading fraud, a high-ranking Chicago
Mercantile Exchange official said Friday.
   But the Chicago Merc's planned improvements to its internal
surveillance systems should make it unnecessary to have government
moles patrol the trading pits, added John F. Sandner, a special
adviser to the exchange's board of director's and its immediate past
chairman.
   Sandner made the comments in an interview with the Associated
Press following Rep. Glenn English's statement Thursday that he
would not rule out the possibility that his investigative panel
would consider giving federal regulators the authority to place
undercover watchdogs on the floors of futures exchanges to guard
against the kind of trading abuse being investigated by the Justice
Department in Chicago.
   ``It sounds like a pretty invasive approach but we don't object
to that approach if it is warranted,'' Sandner said.
   ``But once Congressman English sees what the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange is going to do as far as supervising our pits and
increasing surveillance, I think that will be unnecessary.''
   Officials of the Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest
futures market, declined to comment on English's remark.
   The Chicago Merc is the world's second-largest futures exchange.
   English, D-Okla., chairs a House agriculture subcommittee that is
examining the fitness of futures-trading regulation.
   He spoke Thursday at the Futures Industry Association's annual
meeting here.
   The federal undercover probe of suspected trading abuse at the
Chicago exchanges has not yet yielded any charges, but it has
focused attention on the opportunities for cheating and prompted
lawmakers to take a closer look at fraud detection and prosecution.

   A union leader at Pan Am Corp. said he planned to
meet the head of Eastern's striking Machinists union Saturday to
discuss a possible employee-led buyout that would combine the two
troubled airlines.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters union's Airline
Division, told The Associated Press that he and Charles Bryan
planned to discuss a possible combination of Eastern and Pan Am.
   ``His (Bryan's) fight is our fight,'' Genoese said Friday in a
telephone interview from Miami. ``We'll do everything we can do in
order to make this successful.''
   The employees of the two carriers would be able to secure
financing for a buyout by agreeing to labor concessions, said
Genoese, who also serves as head of the Teamsters local at Pan Am. A
combination of the two airlines would give Pan Am domestic routes to
feed into its international network, he said.
   Bryan confirmed that he planned to meet with Genoese but declined
to say whether they would explore an employee-led, Eastern-Pan Am
combination.
   ``We're going to be discussing a whole range of subjects,'' Bryan
said from his office in Miami.
   Eastern has been crippled since last its Machinists went on
strike March 4 and later were joined by most of the airline's pilots
and flight attendants.
   Spokesmen for other unions at the two airlines weren't available
for comment. Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon in New York and
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said their companies had no
comment on the meeting.
   Financial analysts say the leading potential buyer for Eastern
remains financier Carl Icahn, the owner and chairman of Trans World
Airlines Inc., who expressed his interest last fall. The Eastern
Machinists indicated last week they want him to explore a possible
buyout and he expressed a willingness to do so if Eastern did not
object.
   Eastern would provide TWA with the same sort of ``fit'' between
domestic and international routes that a Pan Am-Eastern combination
would create.
   Pan Am, like Eastern, has been racked by financial losses and
labor tensions. Pan Am Chairman Tom Plaskett recently said the
carrier probably would need to merge with another airline to ensure
its survival.
   Last year Pan Am imposed $35 million in pay cuts on its 4,200
Teamsters, who are led by Genoese, after they rejected a new
cost-cutting contract.
   ``Two negatives don't make a positive,'' said Robert Joedicke, an
airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., referring to a
possible Pan Am-Eastern combination. ``The cards are stacked against
them.''
   As the labor crisis at Eastern has escalated, Bryan has been the
nemesis of Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo. Genoese has long been a thorn
in the side of Pan Am and other airlines where the Teamsters are
represented.
   The Teamsters at Pan Am and the 8,500 Eastern Machinists both
represent baggage handlers, although there are differences in the
composition of the two unions.
   Bryan and Genoese said the Teamsters plan to contribute $100,000
to the Eastern employees' strike fund.

   Wholesale prices surged 1.0 percent in
February, matching the January increase and marking the worst
back-to-back news on inflation in nearly eight years, the government
said Friday.
   The identical increases in the Labor Department's Producer Price
Index mean that prices one stop short of the retail level have risen
at an annual rate of 12.6 percent so far this year.
   Not since March and April of 1981 have prices risen so sharply
for two months in a row. Wholesale prices rose 4.0 percent last year.
   Stock and bond prices tumbled after Friday's report. The Dow
Jones average of 30 industrial stocks plunged 50 points in the first
half hour of trading, and closed down 48.57 at 2,292.14. The
evidence of resurgent inflation renewed traders' fears that the
Federal Reserve Board will push interest rates higher.
   That would increase the government's cost of financing the $2.7
trillion national debt, which would be bad news for President Bush,
who is trying to trim the budget deficit without raising taxes.
   Bush, speaking to reporters as he returned to Washington from
Colorado, said his administration would ``always be vigilant against
inflation (and) never relax our concern.''
   He said the best way to beat inflation would be an agreement with
Congress to reduce the deficit and called Friday's report, ``Another
clarion call to do something.'' Negotiators from Capitol Hill and
the White House will exchange proposals next week on bringing down
the deficit.
   Bush's remarks amount to a shift in his rhetoric. Previously, the
president has said he is not overly concerned with inflation and
interpreted economic reports less negatively than the Federal
Reserve.
   Many economists had dismissed the January inflation news,
including a 0.6 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index, the
largest in two years, as at least a partial aberration and had
predicted only a moderate 0.4 percent climb in wholesale prices in
February.
   With the latest report, ``it's difficult to put a happy face on
it,'' said Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Ortner. ``There's no
other interpretation that can be put on it other than it shows a
pickup in inflation.''
   Prices in both January and February were pushed up by soaring
energy and food prices, but the cost of other items, which are
generally more stable, increased at a worrisome rate in February as
well.
   Wholesale food prices rose 1.2 percent last month, the steepest
increase in 13 months. They had risen 1.1 percent in January.
   Meat and most other food items rose, while eggs dropped 15
percent after rising 20.1 percent in January. Food prices were led
by 35.3 percent increase in vegetables, including a huge 158 percent
rise in tomato prices.
   Economist Donald Ratajczak of Georgia State University said beef
prices should continue to rise through the spring, until ranchers
can rebuild herds that were culled by extra slaughtering during last
summer's drought.
   He said fruit prices will continue to rise, at least temporarily,
because fruit grown domestically in hot houses is more expensive
than Chilean fruit held off supermarket shelves because of the
cyanide scare.
   Energy prices jumped 2.4 percent overall in February, following a
4.9 percent increase a month earlier. The latest surge was led by a
4.1 percent rise in gasoline prices, the same as January's increase,
and a 1.9 percent advance in the cost of natural gas. Fuel oil
prices fell 3.1 percent, recovering somewhat from an 11.6 percent
surge a month before.
   Ratjczak said he expects further increases in energy costs as the
vacation driving season begins. Crude oil prices, at $20 a barrel,
are at a 17-month high, propelled by the success of oil-producing
nations in controlling output.
   Wholesale prices, excluding the volatile food and energy
catagories, rose a brisk 0.6 percent in February, up from a 0.4
percent rise a month earlier. Toilet paper, prescription medicines,
books and flatware prices all increased substantially.
   The overall February increase left the Producer Price Index for
finished goods at 111.7, meaning that a hypothetical selection of
goods costing $100 in 1982 would have cost $111.70 last month. That
was up 70 cents from January and $5.60, or 5.3 percent, from
February 1988.
   Despite the severe price hikes in February at the finished goods
level, increases earlier in the production process were more
moderate. Prices at the intermediate level rose 0.5 percent while
the cost of crude goods dipped 0.1 percent after two months of
increases above 3 percent. A loaf of bread is an example of an item
at the finished goods level, flour at the intermediate level and
wheat at the crude level.

television networks and their local affiliate stations to two years.
   The FCC said the rule, adopted in 1945 when TV networks were just
forming and lining up local outlets for their programs, was no
longer necessary to assist in the development of new TV networks in
today's television industry of alternative delivery systems such as
satellites and cable.
   ``The current video marketplace provides so many opportunites for
establishing alternative network-type systems for the delivery of
video programming that existing networks will not be able to
foreclose the entry of new networks in the future,'' the commission
said.
   Without the rule, new networks may find it easier to attract
capital and advertisers if they can attract a stable crop of
affiliates, the FCC said.
   ``Elimination of the rule may, in fact, facilitate new entry and
thereby enhance competition and provide even greater program
diversity to the public,'' the agency said.
   Longer contracts may permit a more solid financial base for
networks, and affiliates with longer contracts will have a long-term
guarantee of programming that may make it easier for them to attract
advertisers, the commission said.

   Seagram Co. Ltd. said Thursday it posted a 13.1
percent rise in annual profit and credited the increase partly to a
strong performance by its beverage businesses.
   Seagram, a leading producer of juices, spirits and wine, reported
a profit of $589.5 million, or $6.12 per share, compared with $521.1
million, or $5.46 a share, in 1987.
   Sales rose to $5.1 million from $3.8 million a year earlier.
   Seagram said its dividend income from E.I. du Pont de Nemours and
Co. _ in which Seagram holds a 22.9 percent stake _ rose 12.8
percent to $202.5 million. Unremitted earnings from Du Pont rose
34.6 percent to $284.4 million.
   Seagram products include Chivas Regal, Crown Royal and Seagram's
7 whiskies, Martell cognac, Barton &amp; Guestier Wines and Tropicana
orange juice.

<HEAD>IBM Says Chip Problem Will Hurt First-Quarter Earnings</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS name of IBM spokesman in 10th graf, Judice sted Thonis.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp.'s stock
plunged and helped pull down the Dow Jones industrial average Friday
after the company said it expected its first-quarter profit to be
below security analysts' estimates.
   IBM attributed the earnings disappointment to a chip problem that
delayed delivery of some computers in its 3090S mainframe line and
said the problem had been fixed.
   IBM's stock sank $5.62{ a share to $112.50 _ a drop of nearly 5
percent _ in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading. IBM's
drop added to the decline in the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks, which had already been hammered by a report of a jump in
wholesale prices.
   A $5.62{ drop in IBM's price translates into an 8-point drop in
the Dow average. Overall, the average fell 48.57 points to 2,292.14.
   The decline in IBM's price occurred even though the company
simultaneously announced plans to increase prices for most of its
products and services by nearly 5 percent, effective immediately.
Higher prices would tend to increase revenue and profitability.
   IBM had acknowledged earlier this month that a chip problem was
delaying delivery of its big mainframe computers but at the time had
said it could not determine what effect, if any, there would be on
its quarterly results.
   It said it now had enough information to predict earnings below
analysts' forecasts. But the statement was ambiguous because it did
not specify which forecasts it would be below, said analyst Wendy
Abramowitz of Argus Research Corp. She noted that quarterly
forecasts range from $1.65 to $2.15 per share.
   Zacks Investment Research Inc. of Chicago said the consensus
earnings forecast of the analysts who report their results to it is
$1.79 a share for the first quarter and $10.98 for 1989 as a whole.
   That compares with IBM's actual earnings of $1.53 in the first
quarter of 1988 and $9.80 a share for 1988.
   IBM spokesman Peter Judice said the production problem involved
chips manufactured by IBM. A shortage of usable chips caused delays
in assembly and shipping of the mainframe computers they go into, he
said. He declined to be more specific.
   ``The chip problem that occurred earlier in the quarter has been
fixed, and the company is working hard to minimize any inconvenience
to customers,'' IBM said in a statement.
   For the year as a whole, IBM said, the delivery delays will make
it more difficult for IBM to achieve the higher end of the range of
analysts' earnings estimates. Those estimates range as high as
$11.80 a share.
   Excluded from the 5 percent price increase announced Friday are
Personal System-2 personal computers and base-layer system software;
maintenance agreement prices on all products; and recently announced
products and price changes, including the new Enterprise System-3090
Model 100S and newly introduced models of the Application System-400.
   Thonis said it was a coincidence that the earnings comment and
the price increase were released on the same day.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Takes Control Of Thrift Portfolio</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Government National Mortgage Association has
seized control of a $2.4 billion portfolio of loans from Heights of
Texas FSB, a thrift formed last year from four insolvent
institutions, federal officials said.
   The federal agency, known as Ginnie Mae, took over administration
of the portfolio after Houston-based Heights did not pass through
mortgage payments to investors who own the loans, said agency
spokesman Jack Flynn.
   The takeover ranks as the biggest single default for the agency,
The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday. The agency already has
contributed $15 million to make up for shortfalls in the payments,
Flynn said.
   Ginnie Mae, part of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development, insures securities backed by home mortgages. Lenders
pool their loans for sale to investors in secondary markets,
providing fesh cash to the institutions to make new mortgages.
   However, the thrifts usually retain servicing rights, including
the collection of mortgage payments for disbursement to holders of
the Ginnie Mae securities.
   Ginnie Mae only insures payments on loans already insured by the
Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Veterans
Administration. But those two agencies have increasingly refused to
take back homes, choosing instead to reimburse lenders at a flat
rate.

   A government report on inflation belted the stock
and bond markets Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average
plunging nearly 50 points on fears of spiraling prices, crushingly
high interest rates and a possible recession.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 48.57 points
to 2,292.14, its biggest drop since a 101.46-point plunge last April
14.
   In the inflation-sensitive bond market, the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond was down more than $17 for every $1,000 in face value
in late trading, pushing the yield to nearly 9.3 percent from 9.1
percent late Thursday.
   The shock came from a Labor Department report that wholesale
prices rose 1.0 percent in February, equalling January's surprising
rise and projecting an annual wholesale inflation rate of 12.6
percent.
   Inflation erodes the value of bonds and produces high interest
rates that sap money from the stock market. Wholesale price
inflation so far this year is more than triple the 4.0 percent rate
of 1988.
   Economists said if the Federal Reserve boosts interest rates too
high in its effort to cool off the economy and dampen inflation, it
could accidentally cut short the record 6{-year-old economic
expansion.
   ``This does increase considerably the chances for a recession,''
said Lawrence H. Meyer, the president of a St. Louis-based economic
consulting firm that bears his name.
   ``It's kind of the worst nightmare for the Fed: Inflation is
picking up just as the economy is beginning to slow down,'' Meyer
said.
   The financial market turmoil would have been worse if investors
concluded that wholesale inflation was going to hit double digits
this year. But most economists agreed the two-month trend is at
least partly a fluke.
   ``It certainly is a very, very discouraging report but it's going
to take more (information) to determine where inflation is going,''
said Thomas Holloway, a senior economist at the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America in Washington.
   Bond prices tumbled immediately after the release of the report.
Stock prices followed suit an hour later when the New York Stock
Exchange opened. Prices plunged so steeply in the opening minutes on
one stock-index futures contract in Chicago that a price limit was
triggered for the first time since it was instituted last year.
   Bargain hunters bought stocks at the lower levels and stabilized
the market in later trading. Trading activity was heightened by
strategies connected with the ``triple witching hour'' expiration of
stock index futures and options.
   The inflation report also knocked stocks lower abroad. In London,
the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index suffered its
worst loss of the year, falling 1.9 percent.
   ``The first and by far the greatest fear is that international
interest rates have yet to go higher,'' said Paul Walton, an
equities analyst at Warburg Securities in London.
   U.S. analysts agreed. ``If the next move is up in interest rates,
this market is going to sail south,'' said William Howard, manager
of over-the-counter trading at Sutro &amp; Co. Inc. in San Francisco.
   Most worrisome to economists was that inflation seemed to be
rising at a time the economy was slowing, as reflected in reports
this week on declines in factory use and housing starts and flat
industrial production.
   The recent rise in crude oil prices to $20 a barrel, if it
sticks, will keep pressuring inflation higher in coming months, said
Richard Stuckey, economist at Du Pont Co. in Wilmington, Del.
   The nature of inflation also seems to be shifting, from the kind
that comes from vigorous economic growth to the kind stemming from
longer-term pressures on labor and materials costs, said Bethel
Minter, economist at Suntrust Banks Inc. in Atlanta.
   This new inflation does not result directly from the economy's
strength and is thus harder for the Fed to stop by raising interest
rates, Minter said.
   Despite the latest inflation report, the Mortgage Bankers
Association continues to predict the national average rate on
fixed-rate mortgages will not rise above 11.5 percent this year,
from the current level of just under 11 percent.
   Still, all interest rates rise in tandem with a decline in the
credit markets and tightening by the Federal Reserve, economists
said. That includes adjustable-rate mortgages, which are tied to
short-term interest rates; many credit card rates and home-equity
loans, which often are tied to the prime rate set by banks; and car
loans, which often are tied to medium-term debt issued by financing
companies.

<HEAD>Burr: Eastern Crisis Raises Specter of Re-Regulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCY GORDON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former head of now-defunct People Express
Airlines says the labor crisis gripping Eastern Airlines has raised
the prospect that the government will try to re-regulate the airline
industry that it opened up a decade ago _ a task he says the
government is ill-equipped to handle.
   Donald C. Burr, the founder of People Express and former employee
of Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo, says the government
already is failing to oversee the industry adequately and would be
unable to do so if it again re-imposed stiff regulations on fares.
   Eastern has been virtually grounded by a two-week-old strike by
its Machinists union, which has been supported by most of the
airline's pilots and flight attendants. The near shutdown of its
operations forced the carrier to file for bankruptcy protection from
creditors on March 9.
   The possible disappearance of Eastern from the skies and the
temptation for its rivals to hike fares has given rise to public
debate about competition within the industry _ and, Burr said in an
interview Thursday, has raised the prospect of re-regulation.
   The federal government deregulated fare competition in the
airline industry in 1978, giving rise to cut-rate carriers such as
People Express.
   Burr, 47, a graduate of Harvard Business School, has placed
himself in the public eye again after about two years of shunning
the press and the spotlight. That fueled speculation he could be
putting himself forward as a possible participant in an Eastern
buyout.
   Burr said he would ``have to consider it'' if the Eastern unions
approached him about leading a buyout, but he stressed that is not
his primary intention.
   ``I've been president of three companies; I've already done
that,'' he said. ``I'm after the same things I've been after my
whole lifetime ... I would love to see the airline industry evolve
toward high-commitment service organizations.''
   Burr said he has talked about broad concepts with Lorenzo from
time to time before the Eastern strike that started March 4.
   Despite Eastern's travails, deregulation on the whole has been
``a stunning success'' that has opened air travel to more Americans,
Burr said. ``It freed the industry to be marketplace-oriented.''
   Burr quit his job as president of Texas International, Texas
Air's predecessor, in January 1980 to start up no-frills People
Express.
   Spurred by the removal of federal restrictions on fares, the
discount carrier quickly grew, by Burr's reckoning, into the world's
fifth-largest airline with revenue of about $2 billion at its peak
in the summer of 1985.
   People Express eventually was defeated by competitors who were
able to match and undercut its fares _ in addition to offering
full-fare services _ and to offer their own powerful computer
reservations systems, said Burr, who sold People Express to Texas
Air for $300 million in September 1986.
   His faith in deregulation undaunted by the experience, Burr
points to Lorenzo as the current ``low-cost warhound.''
   If Lorenzo's Eastern and sister carrier Continental Airlines
fail, ``we would lose the last major low-cost product,'' Burr warned.
   That event also could open the field to a new low-cost carrier _
which some observers say Burr might be inclined to start up.
   He currently is writing a book on People Express and lectures at
several universities, including Harvard, Stanford, Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University of North Carolina. He
says he also has looked at possible new airline deals from time to
time.

<HEAD>Opening Slide Prompts Use of `Circuit-Breaker' for S &amp; P 500s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock index futures plunged Friday under the weight of a
fast-falling stock market, prompting the first use of a trading
limit designed to halt panic sell-offs that had been put in place
after the October 1987 crash.
   On other markets, crude oil futures posted another strong gain,
but the rest of the complex slipped; precious metal futures advanced
slightly; and livestock and pork futures were mixed.
   The Standard &amp; Poors 500 stock index futures opened limit-down
and prompted the first use of a so-called circuit-breaker that was
designed to halt panic sell-offs.
   ``There was panic-type selling at the opening, and after the
limit, fear to enter the market for nearly five hours,'' said Roy
Postel, analyst with IDE Reports Inc. ``But looking back, I'd call
it an orderly sell-off in all respects.''
   A larger-than-expected 1 percent increase in wholesale prices
slammed the stock market at the opening bell, and the S&amp;P 500
futures contract for June on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange opened
simultaneously down 5 points.
   Merc officials responded by imposing a 10-minute trading limit on
the contract, following the terms of an agreement with the New York
Stock Exchange designed to prevent free-falling prices.
   The agreement, which calls for limits of trading of varying time
depending on how steeply prices fall, is triggered at the Merc
before the NYSE because of the quicker access to the futures
contracts than stock issues.
   After the circuit-breaker was lifted, the S&amp;P 500 contract
tumbled another three points, and moving in lockstep with the stock
market it tracks, stablized until about 1 p.m. EST.
   ``That's when word came out that IBM was going to have trouble
delivering a product line on time and hurt its earning prospects,
and the bargain hunters who were buying left about the same time,''
said Bob Ray, of Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago. ``We hit the lows
about a half-hour later, and pared back a little from then on out.''
   The S&amp;P 500 futures index settled 8.4 points to 8.5 points lower,
with June contract at 295.45.
   Crude oil, meanwhile, continued its steady climb at the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Unlike earlier in the week, however, heating
oil and unleaded gasoline failed to follow the move higher because
of adequate supplies and slackening demand for the products.
   Crude oil was 1 cent lower to 49 cents higher, with the April
contract crashing what some traders called an important
psychological barrier at $20 and settling at $20.33 a barrel;
heating oil was .03 cent to .26 cent lower, with April at 53.57
cents a barrel; and unleaded gasoline was .27 cent lower to .26 cent
higher, with April at 55.62 cents a gallon.
   Gold, silver and platinum futures all posted moderate gains, but
a number of traders were puzzled why the precious metals didn't
advance further in the wake of the inflationary implications of the
rise in wholesale prices.
   ``I think the problem is the market is still getting mixed
signals on inflation,'' said Peter Cardillo, commodity trading
adviser for Josephthal &amp; Co., New York. ``At the beginning of the
week, most of the (economic) indicators pointed to slowing growth. I
think the $64,000 question in the precious metals is will we see
slower growth in the next two or three months.''
   Gold settled $3.70 to $5.70 higher on the Comex, with the March
contract at $393.60 a troy ounce; silver was 6.5 cents to 10.2 cents
higher, with March at $6.124 a troy ounce. Platinum, traded on the
New York Merc, was $4.60 higher across the board, with April at
$550.10 a troy ounce.
   The livestock market on the Chicago Merc opened under pressure
because of a government cattle-on-feedlot report released after the
markets closed Thursday showed a record number of placements for
Feburary.
   But traders betting that slack demand will pick up after Easter
helped rally the April contract, and that forced those who were
holding contracts for the deferred months back into the market.
   Exactly the opposite situation prevailed in the hog contracts.
With several influential analysts predicting a USDA report on hogs
due March 31 will show some supply tightness later this year or
early 1990, traders flocked to the later month contracts.
   Live cattle settled .23 cent lower to .70 cent higher, with April
at 78.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .93 cent lower to .15
cent higher, with March at 79.67 cents a pound; hogs were .58 cent
lower to .15 cent higher, with April at 42.72 cents a pound; and
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent lower to .70 cent higher, with
March at 36.95 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices closed mostly higher, but wheat and corn
mixed Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   On the close, wheat was 3 cents lower to } cents higher, with the
contract for delivery in March at $4.34 a bushel; corn was } cent
lower to { cent higher, with March at $2.78\ a bushel; oats were }
cent lower to { cent higher, with March at $2.08 a bushel; and
soybeans were 1 cent lower to 6} cents higher, with March at $7.69{
a bushel.

<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge ruled Friday that Polaroid Corp.
can go ahead with its plan to buy back 22 percent of its shares and
reaffirmed the company's controversial employee stock ownership plan.
   Shamrock Holdings Inc., which is trying to take over Polaroid,
had sought an injunction against the stock buyback plan, which it
said would stack the deck in favor of Polaroid's current management
in a proxy fight.
   Vice Chancellor Carolyn Berger issued the rulings in Delaware
Chancery Court.
   Polaroid has been resisting Shamrock's hostile takeover bid since
July, when the Burbank, Calif., company made a friendly but
unsolicited offer of $40 a share. In January, Shamrock increased the
bid to $45, valued at $3.2 billion.
   Last July, Polaroid put 9.7 million shares into an employee stock
ownership plan. In January, the company announced a recapitalization
plan that included selling $300 million of stock to Corporate
Partners L.P., a private investment group.
   Shamrock, a radio and television concern owned by the Roy E.
Disney family, owns about 4.8 million shares of Polaroid and is
waging a proxy fight for control of the board of directors at the
May 9 annual meeting.

<HEAD>Ruling Clears Way for Apple's Copyright Claim</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge gave Apple Computer Inc. an
important preliminary victory Friday in its legal battle with fellow
computer giants Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., clearing
the way for a copyright suit over visual displays for Apple's
Macintosh system.
   U.S. District Judge William Schwarzer issued a tentative ruling,
which he affirmed by comments at an hour-long hearing, that a 1985
Apple-Microsoft licensing agreement did not entitle Microsoft to
produce a display program called Windows 2.03, the target of the
copyright suit.
   ``Windows 2.03, the product as it is now being offered, is not
covered by the license,'' Schwarzer said.
   The ruling means Microsoft cannot claim permission from Apple to
market a program with visual displays similar to those in the
Macintosh, Apple's biggest-selling model. But the case is far from
over.
   Apple still must prove that Windows 2.03 is ``substantially
similar'' to the Macintosh menu screen graphics, distinctive for
their use of pictoral symbols such as file drawers and wastebaskets,
rather than written commands, to enter and use the computer system.
   Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard, which uses the Windows display for
a computer program called New Wave, contend that Apple's own program
was not original but was derived from other companies' works.
   They also argue that the graphics Apple is trying to protect are
no more than basic ideas, like the use of office equipment as
symbols. Ideas cannot be copyrighted, only expressions of ideas;
courts have also refused copyright protection when an idea can be
expressed in only one way.
   Microsoft said it would have no comment until it had reviewed
Schwarzer's written ruling. Apple called it an important ruling.
Hewlett-Packard was not directly a party to the decision.
   The suit could have a large impact. Microsoft's program is
compatible with International Business Machines Corp. equipment; a
verdict that gave broad protections to Apple's ``user-friendly''
displays would keep similar systems off IBM computers and could slow
the development of software for systems like Windows and New Wave.
   Friday's ruling knocked out Microsoft's first line of defense
against the suit: that the 1985 licensing agreement with Apple,
allowing an early version of the display program called Windos 1.0,
was broad enough to cover a later version such as Windows 2.03.
   Schwarzer said his ruling was narrow and did not necessarily mean
that any particular visual symbols, called ``icons,'' could not be
duplicated. But the judge indicated disagreement with a suggestion
by Microsoft lawyer David McDonald that the copyright claim could be
decided by comparing each individual symbol in the two programs.
   ``I don't think you can go item-by-item,'' Schwarzer said. ``You
have to look at the visual display as a whole.''
   The judge did not decide, however, whether Microsoft had the
right to duplicate icons that were contained in the earlier Windows
1.0 as well as Windows 2.03.
   Schwarzer also expressed no view on Apple's argument that a
program with the same ``look and feel'' as the Macintosh display
would violate the copyright. That issue may be resolved when the
case goes to trial.
