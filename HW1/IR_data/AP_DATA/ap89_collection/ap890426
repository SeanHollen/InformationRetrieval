   The governing party on Thursday forced the 1989
budget through a parliamentary committee, paving the way for Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita to resign in a far-reaching political
scandal.
   Takeshita pledged Tuesday to resign after Parliament passes the
budget to take responsibility for the scandal, which involves
influence-peddling and questionable stock dealings among senior
government officials.
   The Liberal Democratic Party was expected to ram the budget
through Parliament later Thursday. The opposition is boycotting the
session, demanding new elections and that former Premier Yasuhiro
Nakasone be summoned to the assembly to testify about his role in
the scandal.
   The Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Japan's
powerful Lower House, took about two minutes to approve the budget.
   There still was no clear successor to Takeshita, since many
senior party leaders are linked to the scandal. Former Foreign
Minister Masayoshi Ito, 75, widely viewed as the top candidate for
interim premier because he is untouched by the scandal, expressed
reluctance again Thursday due to poor health.
   On Wednesday Takeshita met with Shintaro Abe, secretary general
of the governing party, and the two agreed to decide on a successor
after Japan's April 29-May 6 ``Golden Week'' holidays.
   The normally unflappable prime minister appeared shaken
following the suicide Wednesday of Ihei Aoki, 58, an aide since
1958 and the man who handled Takeshita's scandal-tainted political
donations.
   ``I strongly regret (his action),'' Takeshita told reporters.
``We walked side by side for over 30 years.''
   Aoki, who had served Takeshita since 1958, was found dead
Wednesday in his Tokyo apartment. Police said he had slashed a
wrist and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself after leaving
notes to his wife and several other people, including Takeshita.
Police declined to reveal the notes' contents.
   Takeshita said he had not seen Aoki's note, but thought it was
possible the suicide was linked to the stock-profiteering and
bribery scandal.
   Aoki's name, not Takeshita's, appeared on loans and share
dealings with the Recruit Co. that are under suspicion both for
political ethics and bribery. The company, an information services
conglomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence with
politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
   Author Yotaro Konaka, a government critic, said, ``Mr. Aoki had
used all his might to protect Prime Minister Takeshita by putting
all blame on himself, and he probably made his choice (to die)
after losing the object to protect when the prime minister
resigned.''
   Tetsuro Muroboshi, who has written books on a number of
corruption scandals, said he could not the motive was
responsibility for Takeshita's fall.
   ``I suspect Mr. Aoki was cornered by something _ something he
could escape from only by ending his own life,'' Muroboshi said.
   Takeshita announced his resignation plan after disclosures over
the weekend that Aoki had accepted a $384,000 loan from Recruit.
   Takeshita told Parliament on April 11 that he had received more
than $1 million in political donations from Recruit, but he did not
mention the loan. He told reporters later he had not known about it.
   Aoki's name also was on opposition parties' list of 154
influential people who earned handsome profits after buying
bargain-price stock in a Recruit subsidiary before it was offered
for public sale. Takeshita denied personal involvement in the stock
deal.
   Prosecutors had questioned Aoki several times. Fourteen
bureaucrats and businessmen _ but no politicians _ have been
arrested on bribery and securities law violation charges in the
case.
   The wide swath of Recruit's donations, loans and share
transactions cut through the political leadership have made it
difficult for the Liberal Democrats to find a replacement for
Takeshita.
   Ito's age and health _ he is a diabetic _ make most observers
consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months
while the party chooses a longer-term leader. The head of the
Liberal Democrats becomes prime minster because of the party's big
majority in Parliament.
   ``When the time is right, he will announce his acceptance,''
Keichiro Nakamura, a aide to former Prime Minister Miki, told The
Associated Press.
   Nakamura called Ito's acsencion ``certain'' and said his clean
reputation will boost the Liberal Democrats' ailing image.
   Hideo Sato, dean of the University of Tsukuba's College of
International Relations, agreed.
   ``I think we need exactly that kind of person,'' Sato said. ``He
is apparently not involved in big money-making connections with
business, and lives in a modest home.''
   Ito served as acting prime minister briefly after Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira died in June 1980.

<HEAD>Thornburgh Calls For More International Cooperation In Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WARREN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorney General Richard Richard Thornburgh on
Wednesday night praised a growing emphasis on international
cooperation in the war on drugs, and promised multinational
operations against drug traffickers.
   Thornburgh spoke at the 20-member International Drug Enforcement
Conference, which President Bush is to adress Thursday morning as
part of two-day visit to Florida.
   Thornburgh spoke to reporters before his address to a closed
session of the conference.
   ``Drug trafficking operations cross many national boundries and
are beyond the reach of any one nation,'' he said.
   The attorney general added that during his trip to Latin America
last month, he made plans for more combined efforts against drugs.
   Thornburgh praised the United Nations Drug Convention adopted
last December in Vienna, and called for its early ratification by
the Senate.
   The multilateral agreement by more than 100 drug-producing and
consuming nations is an effort to establish a set of
internationally recognized drug trafficking offenses as guidelines
for domestic law in each country.
   In his speech, released before the closed session, Thornburgh
praised the arrest earlier this month of Manuel Felix Gallardo, who
was thought to control much of the Mexican drug trade.
   ``None of us are naive enough to think that the arrest of one
kingpin will dismantle any cartel,'' Thornburgh said. ``But the
fact that we now have `untouchables' such as Felix Gallardo and
(former Colombian kingpin) Carlos Lehder behind bars sends powerful
signals worldwide.''
   All member nations of the conference have laws on the books or
pending to control drug-processing chemicals, Lawn said.
   Legislation signed into law last November by President Reagan
requires manufacturers to keep sales records and encourages them to
report suspicious purchases of precursor chemicals to the DEA.
   The law drew particular praise from the Colombian delegation,
which maintains its country has been blamed unfairly for the
international drug scourge.
   The seventh annual conference, meeting in the United States for
the first time, has drawn upper-level drug enforcement officials
from Latin America and Canada in an effort to develop a hemispheric
anti-drug strategy.
   On Thursday, Bush is scheduled to participate in a simulated
drug interdiction exercise and to address an opening ceremony at a
high-tech center where the U.S. Customs Service and the Coast Guard
will gather intelligence and coordinate the fight against drug
smugglers throughout the eastern United States.

   Three Soviet cosmonauts returned to Earth on
Thursday, leaving the space station Mir with no one at the helm for
only the second time since it was launched more than three years
ago.
   The descent module touched down in Kazakhstan in Soviet Central
Asia at 6:59 a.m. Moscow time, the official news agency Tass
reported. The Soyuz TM-7 landed about 90 miles northeast of
Dzheskazgan in cloudy skies with observation helicopters on hand.
   Launch director cosmonaut Vladimir Gzhenebekov told Soviet
television ``a little correction'' was made, but there were no
problems with the landing.
   Mir, considered the showpiece of the Soviet space program, is
expected to remain unmanned until August in what officials called a
money-saving move prompted by delays in preparing new scientific
equipment for the spacecraft.
   The Soviet media and and candidates in recent elections
complained the billions of dollars spent on space would be better
applied to social services on Earth.
   Officials also said the break also would give scientists a
chance to review the masses of information gathered since Mir was
launched in February 1986.
   Cosmonauts Alexander Volkov, Sergei Krikalev and Valery Polyakov
spent Wednesday packing a landing module and mothballing some
on-board systems, the Tass news agency reported.
   A new crew is scheduled for launch this summer for a six-month
mission aboard the orbiting station. The new cosmonauts are to
install new modules that will approximately double the station's
size and equipment and ``usher in the second phase of Mir's service
life,'' Tass said.
   In September, an Afghan and a Soviet cosmonaut were forced to
postpone the landing of their Soyuz TM-5 capsule in Soviet Central
Asia for a day because of equipment and crew errors. They touched
down safely a day late but were running dangerously low on food and
air.
   In December, two Soviet cosmonauts returned from the Mir after
breaking the record for the longest time in space with a year-long
stay. They and a French crew member stayed on board an unplanned
extra three hours because the memory of a computer aboard their
capsule overloaded, Soviet media reported.
   Gzhenebekov, however, denied that there were serious problems on
those occasions on the television news broadcast.

   Tens of thousands of Chinese students, cheered by
bystanders, surged through police roadblocks Thursday to press for
more democracy in a march that Communist authorities had vowed to
stop.
   Riot police fitted with helmets, shields and sticks closed
100-acre Tianamen Square, the students' destination at the center
of Beijing. Truckloads of police were parked along the square,
about nine miles southeast of the campus area where the march began.
   ``Police get out of the way, people's police belong to the
people,'' the students shouted as they pressed through a barricade
of about 300 police at a major intersection in northwest Beijing.
   Student leaders urged youths from dozens of Beijing universities
to march to Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of China, to
protest harsh government statements condemning their 11-day-old
campaign for democracy.
   Government officials, in mass meetings Wednesday, declared the
demonstrations illegal. Beijing Communist Party Secretary Li Ximing
told a special meeting of 10,000 city party officials, ``We must
firmly stop such riots.''
   However, by noon, the marchers had pushed through three police
blockades set up along the route. Authorities gave way, and there
were no injuries.
   ``It was like watching an iron bar bend'' one bystander said,
describing the police retreats. When three truckloads of armed
police pulled up at an intersection, it was surrounded by a crowd
shouting, ``People love the people's police, the people's police
love people.''
   Students with arms linked sang the national anthem and shouted
``long live democracy'' as they headed down the main road from
their campuses to the square. Others shouted ``down with
bureaucracy, down with corruption.''
   Students reported that thousands of troops had massed near the
Beijing Normal University along the student route toward the center
of the city.
   ``I already know that I might die today. I am prepared,'' said
one student.
   Thousands of bystanders along the street shouted ``Get out of
the way!'' and ``Don't beat them!'' when police temporarily blocked
the students at one intersection.
   Along the route, thousands of people leaned out windows and
applauded the students. Doctors and patients in bathrobes from a
local hospital grabbed for pamphlets the students were handing out.
   A Chinese journalist speaking on condition of anonymity said the
government moves against the protest were made by order of senior
leader Deng Xiaoping to stop the students' campaign against
official corruption and for sweeping democratic reforms such as a
free press.
   ``The peasants support us, the workers support us, the army
supports us, so why should we be bothered by students?'' the
journalist quoted Deng as saying Tuesday. The journalist, from the
official People's Daily, spoke on condition of anonmyity.
   Spurred by the April 15 death of ousted Communist Party chief Hu
Yaobang, a reformer, tens of thousands of students marched
repeatedly to Tiananmen Square last week. They held unprecedented
sit-ins outside government and party headquarters in the largest
student protest in four decades of Communist rule.
   More than 70,000 students from 41 Beijing schools began a class
boycott Monday. They have demanded that 84-year-old Deng step down,
and they want Premier Li Peng to open a dialogue with them.
   Loudspeakers at Beijing University appealed to the students
Thursday, ``We urge you to think what kind of problems will arise
if you leave the university. Think what kind of effect this will
have on your family and parents.''
   But the students have won widespread support from Beijing
residents, who have donated more than $8,000 to their campaign.
   Huge crowds have flocked to read the students' posters, and many
people have expressed agreement in unprecedented street-side
political debates.
   In front of the People's University, one middle-aged man told
several dozen listeners Wednesday he had canceled his newspaper
subscriptions.
   ``There's no point reading them, all the papers are the same,''
he said. Shanghai officials announced they had dismissed the editor
of Shanghai's weekly World Economic Herald, China's most outspoken
newspaper, and would reorganize it.

   A second day of bad weather prevented the Alaska
National Guard from bringing two Soviet defectors to the mainland
from Little Diomede Island, a Guard spokesman said Tuesday.
   Mike Haller said that when weather permits, a Guard helicopter
will fly the men from the island in the Bering Strait to Nome. From
there they will be flown to Anchorage to file formal requests for
political asylum.
   The two sought asylum just hours before officials signed a
protocol aimed at easing travel restrictions between Alaska and
Siberia.
   Their applications will be forwarded to the State Department for
review and a recommendation, said Gary Johnson, district director
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The final decision
rests with the INS, he said.
   The process usually takes several weeks, Johnson said.
   Soviet officials are aware of the defections, but ``at this
point we have no comment,'' said Andre Dronov, a Soviet vice consul
based in San Francisco.
   Johnson declined to identify the men or provide additional
information about them. But sources on the island, who asked not to
be identified, said the men were apprentice journalists from Moscow
in their mid-30s. They are staying at the local Guard armory.
   Johnson said they were the first Soviet defectors in his 10
years with the INS in Alaska.
   The men were reported missing when the Soviet delegation
prepared to leave the island by helicopter after a party following
the signing ceremony.
   Other National Guardsmen helped the Soviets search for the two,
said Jim Stimpfle, a Nome Chamber of Commerce official who had
reached the island before the weather turned bad.
   Stimpfle said the guardsmen apparently either didn't know about
the defections or felt it wasn't proper protocol to inform their
Soviet guests.
   Adj. Gen. John Schaeffer, commander of the Alaska National
Guard, said the timing of the defections was embarrassing.
   ``The governor is trying to get along better with the Soviets
and here comes a couple of people who are basically messing up the
operation,'' said Schaffer, ``All of us would have liked to say,
`Sorry guys, let's try next week.'''
   Stimpfle, still weathered in on the island, said the defectors
are being kept under tight security. ``Everything is hush, hush,''
he said. ``They've even got the armory windows blacked out with
ponchos or something.''

   No superheroes grace the pages of
Javier Juarez's comic books, no archvillains with maniacal plots to
control the world, and not a single ``Pow!'' ``Zap!'' or ``Bam!''
   Even so, the black-and-white adventures of ``Felipe'' and his
friends as they try to conquer a mountain of bureaucratic obstacles
to become legal U.S. residents may be the most dog-eared literature
in California.
   Distributed free at employment offices, churches and social
service agencies, the booklets are lessons in applying for
residency under the complex 1986 Immigration Reform and Control
Act, better known as the amnesty program.
   ``Amnistia'' or ``Amnesty,'' about applying for temporary
residency, was out of print soon after the release of 50,000 copies
a year ago. ``The Second Phase,'' about permanent residency and
avoiding disqualification, is in its second printing four months
after distribution of the first 30,000 copies.
   ``We've never had this kind of response with any material
before,'' said Emily Goldfarb, executive director of the San
Francisco-based Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights and
Services, which produced the books.
   The potential audience in California exceeds 1.58 million, the
number of applicants for residency status under the amnesty program.
   ``All this subject matter is deadly boring if you aren't
affected by it. If you are affected by it, it's not deadly boring _
it's terrifyingly boring,'' said Juarez, 39, a former Mexican
government economist who got the idea after he married a U.S.
citizen and moved from Mexico City to California.
   So Juarez lightened it up, capitalizing on the gallows humor and
love of storytelling he said is the heritage of Mexico, where
political cartooning has enjoyed a long tradition and soap
opera-style novellas are popular.
   ``Lots of people say, `Why a comic book? That's for a kid or the
mentally retarded.' There's nothing comic about the situations
portrayed in the comic books. Actually, it's a matter of life and
death. It's going to determine where they live and work. But
there's no reason to lose your sense of humor.''
   When the characters discuss the difficulties of obtaining
documents and witnesses' sworn statements to prove they've been in
the country since Jan. 1, 1982 _ the cutoff date for amnesty
applications _ Felipe laments: ``Even my mother-in-law wanted to
use the opportunity to get rid of me.''
   The idea was so good that the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, which had said it couldn't afford to produce Juarez's
book, followed suit. The government version also proved popular,
said Scott Nyborn, outreach coordinator with the INS in San
Francisco. ``I don't think we have any left, actually.''
   Juarez writes the scripts in Spanish, then translates them for
English editions. A former student of dramatic arts, he gets help
with illustrations from his media-wise family _ his father works in
advertising, his brother in film-making, and his sister is a
television director in Mexico.
   He strives to write the scripts in the idioms of everyday
Spanish, while accurately imparting information about the amnesty
program _ a task that can be a ``nightmare'' because experts
frequently disagree on the complex law.
   Goldfarb believes that unlike with government brochures, people
hang onto the comics and read them aloud to their families,
reaching illiterate people who otherwise might be misinformed or
exploited by swindlers.
   ``They're fun to read,'' she said. ``The graphics and the
conversations and the cultural aspects of it are things that people
can identify with.''
   ``Amnistia'' dealt with the first phase of the amnesty program,
but applying for residency is just the first step. The application
dealines were May 5, 1988, for aliens here since 1982 and Nov. 30
for seasonal agriculture workers who had picked perishable crops at
least 90 days between May 1985 and May 1986.
   The second phase deals with permanent residency and problems
like arrests, unemployment and welfare dependancy that can make
applicants ineligible.
   Two more issues are in the works to address mandated AIDS tests;
qualifying for government assistance including free and
reduced-price school lunches and prenatal and infant medical care,
and meeting requirements for a basic understanding of English, and
American civics and history.
   If the next issue wins a state grant, Goldfarb said the
Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition plans to print 70,000 copies
for distribution by its 80 nonprofit member organizations in the
San Francisco Bay area, then make it available to other
organizations throughout the state to reprint.
   Juarez said the widespread readership is its own reward and has
inspired him to try producing as his next project an analytical
Spanish-English language magazine for California's rapidly growing
Hispanic population.

   NBC domination of prime-time reached 44 weeks
_ two shy of the record, but ABC's comedy heavyweight ``Roseanne''
beat out ``The Cosby Show'' for the top spot.
   NBC had six of the top 10 shows and ABC had three, while CBS
managed only one.
   NBC's cumulative rating was 13.3, with a 23 share for last week;
CBS was second with an 11.8 rating and a 21 share; ABC 11.6 and 20,
according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
   Each rating point represents 904,000 households with
televisions. The share is a percentage of sets in use.
   Two sitcoms about families _ the blue-collar ``Roseanne'' and
NBC's upper middle-class Huxtables on ``The Bill Cosby Show'' _
placed first and second in the ratings, respectively.
   ``Roseanne'' served as a lead-in for the ABC premiere of the new
series ``Have Faith,'' with a spring debut at No. 3. The show is
about three Roman Catholic priests and a monsignor in a Chicago
parish.
   NBC's ``A Different World'' was fourth, followed by its
``Cheers''; ``The Wonder Years,'' on ABC; ``The Golden Girls,''
NBC; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS; and NBC's ``Empty Nest'' and ``Hunter.''
   NBC's ``Nick and Hilary'' made its debut at 18th place. The show
is a half-hour retool of the failed hourlong ``Tattinger's.''
   The made-for-television movie, ``Baywatch: Panic At Malibu
Pier,'' about muscular Southern California lifeguards, was in 11th
place for NBC. The show from former NBC chief Grant Tinker's
production company is a contender for a fall series.
   The ABC-TV movie ``Peter Gunn,'' returning one of television's
most popular detectives to the small screen, was in 21st place,
while NBC's two-part miniseries ``Around The World In 80 Days,''
starring Pierce Brosnan, landed in 30th and 31st places.
   In news, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' took first place for the
week with a 10.0 rating, followed by ``CBS Evening News'' with 9.3
and ``NBC Nightly News'' with 8.9.
   NBC is closing on the 46-week first-place Nielsens run that CBS
achieved in the 1962-1963 season, when the CBS schedule included
``The Andy Griffith Show,'' ``The Beverly Hillbillies,'' ``The Dick
Van Dyke Show'' and ``Perry Mason.''
   Fox Network's ``Married...With Children,'' recently under fire
by groups critical of the show's portrayal of family life, stood in
49th place and was the network's highest-rated show for the week,
followed by ``America's Most Wanted,'' at 58th and ``21 Jump
Street,'' in the 76th spot.

   The dancers looked like winners as the New York
City Ballet opened its spring season playing its strongest suit,
choreography by George Balanchine.
   ``Mozartiana,'' from 1981, ``Episodes,'' from 1959, and
``Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' from 1941, all choreographed
by Balanchine, comprised Tuesday's opening night program at the New
York State Theater.
   On this occasion, the modern movements in ``Episodes,'' to Anton
von Webern music, had the most bite and gave the most pleasure.
Helene Alexopoulos and Leonid Kozlov had a duet lighted by two or
sometimes one spotlight, just on them. This gave their very
athletic movements, as when he faced the audience with her clinging
upside down on his back, a look of mystery and futurism.
   We also saw modern-looking postures and moves in the duet by
Wendy Whelan and Jock Soto. These young dancers gave this great
performance art a new look. Miss Whelan, not yet a principal or
soloist, was filling in for ballerina Heather Watts.
   The other two couples in ``Episodes'' were Judith Fugate and
Jukka Aromaa and Maria Calegari and Otto Neubert. Peter Frame
seemed to be struggling with his angular solo.
   The very musical Kyra Nichols was joined by Jean-Pierre Frohlich
and Ib Andersen in ``Mozartiana'' to open the evening. Four tiny
girls from the School of American Ballet, as always, added charm to
``Mozartiana.''
   The final ballet, ``Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,'' has for
its leading ballerina role the same poignancy and elegance given
the star of ``Swan Lake.''
   When the ballet was new, its name was ``Ballet Imperial,''
because the choreography is in the tradition of the Russian
masters. Balanchine dropped the title and scenery in 1973.
   But Darci Kistler and Melinda Roy wore tiaras, which made them
look regal. And Adam Luders, a superb partner who can look like a
pale prince, is perfect for a mood of quietly heroic sadness, which
the music and dance sometimes dips into. Miss Kistler was
substituting for Merrill Ashley.
   Robert Irving conducted. Richard Moredock was the assertive
piano soloist in the Tchaikovsky.
   The season will run through June 25.

<HEAD>Newspaper Publishers Urged To Use Technology, Updated Ads, To Thrive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDSEY TANNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers must use the latest technologies and
updated advertising techniques in order to remain a competitive,
thriving force in their communities, publishers have been told.
   Some newspapers are already following that advice with
impressive results, news executives were told at the American
Newspaper Publishers Association's 103rd annual convention on
Tuesday.
   These papers, for example, are using telephone recordings of
up-to-the-minute sports scores and boldly colored ads in the middle
of their stock listings.
   ``If newspapers are going to be as successful in the future as
they've been in the past, we have to be much more zealous about
getting close to our customers and staying there. Technology can
help us do that,'' said James K. Batten, president of Miami-based
Knight-Ridder
   Batten spoke to more than 500 people gathered for a morning
session at the three-day meeting, which ends today.
   In 1967, he said, 73 percent of American adults said they read a
newspaper every day, while last year, ``everyday readership hit a
new low of 51 percent,'' and sank to 29 percent ``among the group
that is key to our long-term future _ adults between 18 and 29.''
   That decline, as well as the aging of the baby-boom generation,
an increase in two-income households and growing cultural
diversity, must be dealt with through technology, Batten said.
   ``Used intelligently, the telephone and the computer can let us
recreate the kind of personal relationships that newspapers had
with their customers 20 or 25 years ago,'' Batten said.
   He cited the Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin, which offers
telephone recordings of soap-opera updates, publishing an access
code for readers. The code is changed daily, so that those who want
to use the service must read the paper to find it. More than 20,000
calls a month are recorded on the system, Batten said.
   In Colorado, he said, the Boulder Daily Camera gets more than
77,000 calls a month for recordings of sports scores and stories
that come in after the paper has gone to press.
   The systems are relatively inexpensive, requiring little more
than a personal computer, phone lines and tape recordings, Batten
said.
   He said newspapers have little choice but to change with their
readers.
   ``These (changes in readers) are threats, not to our existence
but to our pricing flexibility, to our ability to finance the news
coverage that our communities deserve and that we want to
provide,'' Batten said.
   Other threats include a trend among advertisers toward using
direct mail and other techniques to communicate directly with
consumers, said Frank A. Bennack Jr., president and chief executive
officer of The Hearst Corp.
   Direct mail represents 14 percent of all U.S. advertising and
its growth is expected to outpace traditional media advertising,
Bennack said.
   Newspapers must develop new strategies for capturing
advertisers' dollars, such as updating their television guide
sections and standardizing ad sizes used in the guides, said Jerry
Tillis, marketing vice president at Knight-Ridder and president of
the Detroit Free Press.
   Tillis noted that with the spread of cable television, ``more
promotion dollars are being spent by networks, stations,'' and
others.
   Another recommendation is ``adoption of the `island position' on
the first page of agate stock listings in your financial
sections,'' he said.
   Craig Standen, president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau,
noted the recent introduction by Portland's Oregonian newspaper of
a boldly colored ad in the middle of its sports scoreboard.
   ``I think the long-term outlook for our business is bright,'' he
said. ``But that future depends on our ability to change and make
new opportunities happen.''

   Ten cars on a train hauling potentially
toxic chemicals derailed Tuesday night, forcing evacuation of
residents up to half a mile away, officials said.
   No injuries were reported and no chemicals were believed to have
leaked as result of the accident, which was reported around 7:45
p.m., said Oakland County sheriff's Sgt. Tom Parker.
   It was not known exactly how many people were evacuated, Parker
said. Evacuees were taken to Milford High School.
   The train was hauling chemicals from Dow Chemical Co.'s Midland
plant 80 miles north of here to Freeport, Texas. Milford is about
20 miles northwest of Detroit.
   The derailed cars were described as empty, but Dow spokesman
Patrick Goggin said they may have contained up to 100 gallons of
chemicals.
   At least nine of the other cars on the train that remained on
the tracks carried potentially toxic chemicals, Goggin said from
the company's Midland headquarters.
   The chemicals were styrene monomer, a liquid used in
refrigerator liners and auto interiors; vinyl chloride, a
compressed gas used as an adhesive; and propylene oxide, a liquid
used to make foam for seats and other products, he said.
   The cars were owned or leased by Dow, though the crew was
employed by a rail company, Goggin said. He said he didn't know the
name of the rail company.

<HEAD>Study: Minorities Vital To Future Of Newspapers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-ANPA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attracting more minority readers would enable
newspapers to tap into fastest-growing segments of the U.S.
population and could offset flat circulation trends, a publishers'
task force says.
   The group presented a 40-page report, titled ``Cornerstone for
Growth: How Minorities Are Vital to the Future of Newspapers,'' to
news executives at the annual convention of the American Newspaper
Publishers Association on Tuesday.
   The study recommends that newspapers pursue not only minority
readers, but minority employees and advertisers as well.
   ``What we have done, in a very quantifiable way, is to make the
case that what is right and fair is also smart business,'' said
David Lawrence Jr., publisher of the Detroit Free Press and
chairman of the task force.
   Daily newspaper circulation is about 63 million, barely more
than the 62 million of 1970.
   But the task force report noted that 87 percent of the U.S.
population growth between now and the year 2000 will be among
minorities, principally blacks, Hispanics, Asian-Americans and
native Americans.
   Further, the report concluded, more than 56 percent of workers
joining the labor force between now and the year 2000 will be
members of minorities. In order to attract both this advertising
target audience and future employees, newspapers will have to
adjust their sights to better serving minorities, the report said.
   ``This ... is a particularly useful tool for publishers as they
continue to change their newspapers to better meet the needs of
their communities,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The
New York Times and chairman of the ANPA.
   In addition to providing profiles on what some newspapers are
doing to adapt to the changing demographics in their markets, the
report debunks myths about minorities that researchers said have
slowed growth in newspaper readership, circulation and advertising:
   _ Although some have suggested pursuing minority markets is
futile because minorities don't read newspapers, the report found
minorities at higher income and education levels have the same
readership rates as non-minorities _ about 70 percent.
   _ Although some argue that Spanish-speaking and Asian groups
resist English-language newspapers, the report concluded their
children will be among the newspaper's future readers.
   _ Although some argue that minorities can't afford to buy
newspapers or advertise in them, the report found minority income
levels increasing and growing faster than non-minority income.
While non-minorities' disposable household income rose just 18
percent from 1980 to 1986, comparable figures show blacks' income
increasing by 21 percent, Hispanics' by 45 percent and
Asian-Americans' by 58 percent.

   Here are excerpts from radio
conversations taped March 24 after the Exxon Valdez ran aground in
Prince William Sound in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The exchanges timed off automatically and began 23 minutes after
the ship's log indicated the tanker ran aground. The tapes were
obtained under a Freedom of Information Act request filed by the
Anchorage Daily News.
   
   12:27 a.m. AST:
   Exxon Valdez Captain Joseph Hazelwood: ``We've fetched up hard
aground north of Goose Island off Bligh Reef. Evidently we're
leaking some oil and we're going to be here for a while.''
   
   1:07 a.m.
   Coast Guard Cmdr. Steve McCall: ``This is the captain of the
port, Commander McCall. Good evening. Do you have any more of an
estimate as to your situation at this time?''
   Hazelwood:``Ah, not at the present, Steve. Joe Hazelwood here. A
little problem here with the third mate, but we're working our way
off the reef. We've, ah, the vessel has been holed and we're
ascertaining right now, we're trying just to get her off the reef
and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.''
   McCall: ``Take it slow and easy. You know, I'm telling you the
obvious, but take it slow and easy, and we're getting help out as
fast as we can.''
   Hazelwood: ``We're in pretty good shape right now,
stability-wise, and, ah trying to extract her off the shoal here.
You can probably see me on you radar, and, ah, once we get under
way, I'll let you know, do another damage control assessment.''
   McCall: ``Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make
sure you don't you know, start doing any ripping. You got a rising
tide, you, another , about an hour and a half worth of tide in your
favor, ah, ah, once you hit that max, I wouldn't recommend doing
much wiggling.''
   Hazelwood: ``Major damage has kind of been done and we kind of
rock and rolled over it. We're just kind of hung up on the stern
here. We're just, ah, we'll drift over it. Ah, I'll get back to
you.''
   McCall: ``Captain of the port out.''
   
   1:59 a.m.
   McCall: ``Any update, captain?''
   A new, unidentified voice on the Exxon Valdez: ``We're still
surveying tanks, trying to assess the damage.''
   McCall: ``Roger, do you have capacity on board to internally
transfer if you need to?''
   The Valdez voice: ``Yes, we could do that.''
   McCall: ``OK, that's, obviously you know better than I do, but
that's highly recommended if, once you've determined which tanks
are holed, to drop the head if you can.''
   The Valdez voice: ``Yes, roger that.''
   McCall: ``Are you still working, trying to get off?''
   The Valdez: ``No, our engines are stopped right now. We're going
to wait 'til there's a little more water underneath us.''
   
   3:19
   McCall: ``Have you had a chance to detect whether or not any
noticeable amount of oil has dropped out of any tanks and, if so,
which tanks are they?''
   A voice from the Exxon Valdez: ``Ah, the initial figure is
138,000 and the chief mate's taking another check on it right now.''
   McCall: ``Which tank is that, or tanks?''
   The same Valdez voice: ``Right now, our starboard slop tank, two
starboard wing tanks, and possibly five center.''
   McCall: ``You said starboard?''
   The voice: ``Roger.''
   McCall (gloomily) _ ``Roger on that, and that was barrels,
correct.''
   The voice: ``That's correct.''

<HEAD>Bush's Ancestral Village Hopes for Presidential Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MESSING, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the day George Bush took over the
presidency from Ronald Reagan, a phone conversation between two
innkeepers added an Old World footnote to the transition.
   ``Well then,'' said John O'Farrell in Ballyporeen, Ireland, to
David Harris in Messing, England. ``I suppose it's over to you.''
   And so it was. On Jan. 20, one minute before opening time, the
mantle of presidential ancestral village passed from Reagan's
Ballyporeen to Messing, the English hamlet that Bush's forebears
left for the New World in 1631.
   When it comes to the business of presidential roots, it's the
pubs that seem to be first to have greatness thrust upon them.
   A highlight of Reagan's 1984 trip to the town of his
19th-century peasant ancestors was O'Farrell's pub, where he
stopped for a drink.
   Now David and Diane Harris, owners of the Old Crown Inn, are
hoping Bush will visit Messing when he comes to Britain at the end
of May and stop by for a pint of local brew.
   Tucked away in the Essex countryside, one hour's train ride east
of London, Messing is largely a bedroom community, so empty on
weekdays that ``you could shoot a cannon through it and nobody
would notice,'' according to Diane Harris, the innkeeper's wife.
   The prospect of presidential glory isn't universally welcomed.
   ``There are one or two people who are apprehensive of hordes of
tourists arriving and of commercialization and trivialization,''
says Roger Carter, chairman of the parish council.
   But he doubts it will happen. Messing's ``nice old buildings
would look pretty daft if they were all modernized and turned into
gift stores,'' said Carter, an engaging, tousle-haired man of 46
who takes Messing's presidential connection with a healthy sense of
humor.
   With one pub, one restaurant, four streets and 250 inhabitants,
the village is so small that its main street is called simply The
Street.
   But as tourism becomes one of Britain's biggest industries,
Essex county authorities have developed a heritage trail for
American visitors, and Messing wants a piece of the action.
   ``Business-wise, it will certainly be better for us. We die a
death during the week,'' says Mrs. Harris.
   Although there is no Bush ancestral home or family burial place
in Messing, the medieval church and quaint houses offer good photo
opportunities.
   George Bush, says Carter, is the biggest thing to happen to
Messing since an earthquake in 1884 knocked down the pub.
   ``Presumably if he comes the whole thing will be so
fantastically organized that we locals will get totally squeezed
out,'' he says.
   Hugh Peskett, the respected British genealogist who traced
Bush's origins to Messing, says the president is directly descended
from an aristocratic farmer who left for America in 1631.
   Mrs. Harris likes to daydream about the president's ancestor
strolling in for a drink at the very spot where she's now serving
breakfast.
   Messing's native population has dwindled over the centuries, but
it is now being replenished by affluent refugees from London.
   Carter, 46, moved here six years ago and commutes to a senior
post office job in London. The Harrises, who are in their 40s,
arrived in 1986 after six years in Bahrain and Kuwait and bought
the pub.
   Understandably, Messing rooted for Bush in the election, and the
pub served cake and champagne when he won. Carter invited him to
visit.
   Though noncommittal, Bush said in his reply that ``Messing will
always have a special place in our hearts.''
   In Ballyporeen, O'Farrell says he had no regrets about ceding
the crown.
   ``I felt quite good about it because President Reagan had a very
successful tenure and it was good to see someone going out on a
high note, especially when there's so much pessimism about these
days,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   As for Harris, he's just happy that fate has linked his village
with Bush. ``It's nice,'' he said, ``to see a local lad make good.''

intellectuals. Their parents are government officials, many of them
are Communist Party members and now they want to change China.
   The tens of thousands of students who took to the streets in
Beijing last week and began an unprecedented class boycott Monday
are by no means the downtrodden of this country of 1.1 billion.
   They are its future scientists, writers, teachers and diplomats.
And they are calling for a new China, one that is democratic, with
a free press and respect for human rights.
   Li Qiang, a senior at Beijing Normal University, remembers when
he first began believing something was wrong with his country.
   The son of a county official in China's northwest, Li, a member
of the Communist Party, recalled that ``people were always giving
us presents.''
   ``There were big meals, TV sets. We never paid for anything.
Last month we got a new video, now we have three,'' he said. ``I
didn't think this was strange until I left home and found out that
governments aren't supposed to work like that.''
   It was his first summer vacation from university.
   ``My father wanted to welcome me home with a banquet. We went
out and had a party. But we didn't pay. The hotel manager owed him
a favor because my father gave him state funds to repair his
building.''
   Li asked his father why he did not pay. ``This is China,'' was
the answer.
   ``This is not the China that I want to be a part of,'' Li said,
expressing a belief shared by many protesters.
   Li's classmate, a 24-year-old woman from Inner Mongolia, said
she was brought up to respect individual rights.
   ``My parents are doctors and we've always had a good
relationship. They let me live my life, never reading my private
letters like other parents. I only wish the government would treat
me the same.''
   Although not a member of the 48 million-member Communist Party,
the woman belongs to its Youth League, a training ground for young
communists.
   She said she believes participating in the protest does not
conflict with the Marxism pushed by the league.
   ``Karl Marx was a democrat. I don't pretend to understand the
real socialism that he wrote about, but I know this isn't it,'' she
said.
   Like many students, the woman was unclear about what kind of
government she wants in China.
   ``But I don't see that as a problem. I know I don't understand
democracy. But my worry now is not with the future, it's with the
present. We have a system that is rotten.''
   Indeed, compared to the pro-democracy protests of 1986-87,
student demands _a free press, more funds for education and
publication of the financial records of China's leadership _ are
relatively clear.
   Still, most students expect the protests to fail. They choose to
view their movement in a romantic light, as a glorious but
inevitably futile cause.
   ``When the time comes they will crush us,'' said one young man
as he gazed at thousands of Chinese soldiers during a demonstration
last week. ``I'm not afraid, but they will crush us just the same.''
   Students said China's increasing openness to the West and the
large number of books translated into Chinese also helped spark
their discontent.
   Several students cited the 1957 book, ``The New Class,'' in
which former Yugoslav official Milovan Djilas charged communism has
produced a new class of privileged leaders instead of a classless
society.
   ``It was an enlightenment for me because it comes from a
socialist country and from a top leader there, too,'' said a
20-year-old sophomore studying psychology.
   Many students said they looked up to leaders of Western
democracies.
   ``I read in the paper that Australia's prime minister, Bob
Hawke, admitted he had been a drinker and a bit of a playboy,''
said one student. ``That to me is a wonderful thing. None of our
leaders would ever do that. They lack honesty and guts.''
   Wu Xi, one of the few demonstrators from a peasant background,
said it was not until he took a trip back home after two years at
university that he made up his mind to try and change China.
   ``I remember when I was in high school. We were taught to love
Deng Xiaoping, and really we did love him,'' he said of China's
84-year-old leader who instituted 1978 agricultural reforms
returning land to peasants. ``But this time when I went home my
family could barely feed me. If this is not Deng's fault, then I
don't know who to blame.''
   Many students openly look down on their countrymen, expressing
impatience with their unwillingness to provide more than some
material and spiritual help to the demonstrators. But they also
doubt themselves.
   ``The Chinese people are numb. They are asleep,'' said one
student. ``But I don't know if we can wake them.''

   Student demonstrators in the past week have
shouted what few Chinese have dared to whisper _ that senior leader
Deng Xiaoping is losing the support of the people.
   In posters, speeches and chanted slogans, students are
proclaiming that the savior of China is too old and too autocratic
and should cede power.
   Deng, who turns 85 in August, is still believed to be widely
admired among the populace for his decade-long program of
market-oriented reforms. But many people are angered by his
government's failure to halt inflation and end rampant corruption.
   Rising public discontent was manifested when bands of youths,
many unemployed, burned and looted buildings in riots that followed
student rallies in two Chinese cities.
   During widespread pro-democracy demonstrations two years ago,
students praised Deng's reforms, which brought relative prosperity
to millions of Chinese. One banner affectionately read, ``Comrade
Xiaoping, how are you?''
   This time, posters appeared reading ``Deng Xiaoping, your time
has come,'' urging the old revolutionary to retire.
   One poster compared him to Tzu Hsi, the autocratic empress
dowager who ruled China from behind the scenes as China's last
imperial dynasty crumbled.
   Some participants in Beijing demonstrations last week smashed
soda bottles on the ground in a symbolic act of disdain for Deng.
The Chinese word for small bottle sounds the same as Deng's name,
``Xiaoping.''
   ``Deng Xiaoping is a great reformer, but he's a dictator and
dictatorship's time is done,''said Wu'er Kaixi, a student leader at
Beijing Normal University. ``We are disappointed in Deng,'' said a
Beijing University student. ``Now we think he has made many
mistakes. He is trying to control power to the point of autocracy,
even though he is retired in name.''
   Deng has sought to avoid the turmoil of Mao Tse-tung's final
years, when factions fought for power while the mentally and
physically enfeebled Chairman lay dying. In 1987, Deng stepped down
from all his posts except the chairmanship of the Central Military
Commission.
   But he is still China's undisputed leader, the man the Communist
Party and the government turn to when tough decisions must be made.
   Although Western diplomats who attended meetings with Deng
recently insist he remains mentally sharp, rumors persist he is
losing his grasp.
   ``A lot of people hope Deng will die,'' said one student. ``He
is old, maybe he is crazy.''
   General outrage over corruption and nepotism among China's
leadership has also not spared Deng. One poster referred to Deng's
son, who has been linked to shady business deals as head of the
China Welfare Fund for the Disabled, as ``Prince'' Deng Pufang.
   Intellectual disenchantment with Deng heightened after the
student demonstrations two years ago, when he allowed, or perhaps
instigated a numbing political campaign against Western liberal
thought.
   Deng also oversaw the ouster of his chosen successor, the
reformist party chief Hu Yaobang. It was Hu's death on April 15
that touched off the current demonstrations.
   Intellectuals also chafe at Deng's policy of pushing economic
liberalization without tackling democratic reforms.
   Deng has said political reform _ meaning mainly a reduction in
the party's role in government and business _ will take a decade,
and it will be at least 20 to 30 years before national elections
are possible.
   For most of China's 1.1 billion people, Deng is the man who
emerged from the ultraleftist chaos of the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution to restore family farms, encourage private initiative
and open China to the outside world.
   But in the past year the economy has been staggered by 30
percent inflation, severe shortages of materials and energy, panic
buying and pandemic corruption.
   Even the peasants, among the first to benefit when Deng moved
quickly to break up the communes, are unhappy about soaring prices
for fertilizer and feed and low prices for grain the state forces
them to grow.
   ``I remember when I was in high school, we were taught to love
Deng Xiaoping. And we really did love him,'' said one student from
the countryside. ``But this time when I went home my family could
barely feed me. If this is not Deng's fault, then I don't know who
to blame.''

   A group convicted for trespassing during
an anti-abortion demonstration said they would defy their sentence
of community service. So the judge decided to get tough.
   City Court Judge John Manning Regan on Tuesday sentenced the 11
to prepare two-page reports on civil disobedience after reading
essays by Plato and Henry David Thoreau. They had been convicted in
December of trespassing at a hospital during a demonstration last
May.
   ``I think it's a bold and honorable step on his part to fulfill
his duty under oath to pronounce sentence, yet to honor our
conscientious objections,'' said David Long, leader of Project
Life, a group that has conducted protests at abortion clinics.
   ``He's basically sentencing us to a dialogue with him about why
we do what we do.''
   Long said he and his co-defendants will obey the sentence
because it does not require them to ``repay society for an evil
done.''
   Regan told them he has the ``deepest respect'' for their
objection and ordered the essays sent to the court by June 16.

   A college student described as obsessed
with war games and sadomasochistic sex was convicted of murder
Tuesday in the 1987 Rambo-style slayings of two men who broke up an
outdoor party he was attending.
   Eric K. Steiger, who could receive the death penalty, stared
impassively as the verdict by a panel of three Superior Court
judges was announced after two days of deliberations.
   Judges Harry Hammer, Thomas V. Keefe Jr. and George W. Ripley
convicted Steiger, 25, of capital felony, two counts of murder and
one count of conspiracy to commit capital murder in the July 11,
1987 slayings of Daniel Seymour, 25, and William Price, 25.
   The judges tentatively set sentencing for June 6.
   Steiger's attorney, F. Mac Buckley, said he would apppeal. He
also said he would file a motion to dispense with the penalty phase
of the trial on grounds that the state's death penalty statute is
unconstitutionally vague.
   The bearded, heavyset Steiger is the great-grandson of the late
Albert Steiger, founder of the Springfield, Mass.-based Steiger's
chain of department stores.
   Seymour and Price broke up a party on a cul-de-sac near the home
Seymour's family had just moved into, authorities said. One of them
allegedly poked Steiger in the nose with an iron bar.
   Steiger, who was among the revelers, left the party, and went to
his home, where he picked up two guns, and put on camouflage
clothing and a black knit ski mask.
   He returned to Seymour's home with two friends and shot Seymour
and Price to death with a 9mm automatic pistol, firing at least 19
armor-piercing bullets at the victims.
   During the four-month trial, Steiger was described as being
obsessed with guns, war games and sadomasochism.
   Buckley conceded that Steiger shot the two men, but argued his
client suffered from mental disease.
   Steiger chose to have his case decided by the judges rather than
a jury.

   The wife of the late Shah of Iran says she was
reluctant to leave her homeland when her husband was deposed in
1979, and offered to stay behind as a symbol of hope for his
supporters.
   ``I said to my husband, `If you think you should go because it
would calm things, then let me stay.' Not that I would have
interfered politically, but if I had stayed, people would have seen
his representative, and it might have given hope to our
supporters,'' said deposed Empress Farah Diba in an interview in
the June-July issue of Memories magazine.
   Farah said she's not sure the Islamic revolution that forced her
husband from his Peacock Throne could have been avoided.
   ``Progress caused so any changes and brought with it so many
problems,'' she said. ``We were trying, in one generation, to jump
from feudal and semi-feudal conditions to the 20th century and
beyond.''
   She said if Iranians had known what his successor, Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini and his followers would be like, she's certain
there would not have been a revolution.
   Farah has homes in the United States and France.

   Singer Liza Minnelli is doggedly denying reports
that she had attempted to smuggle Lilly, her beloved Cairn terrier,
into Sweden.
   ``We were given the wrong information, weren't we Lilly?'' said
Ms. Minnelli during an interview in her dressing room at the Paris
Opera where she performed a benefit concert Tuesday night with
Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr.
   At the time of the incident April 9, Swedish authorities said
they suspected the American singing star had attempted to slip the
dog into the rabies-free country to circumvent a law requiring a
four-month quarantine. But Ms. Minnelli said they were barking up
the wrong tree.
   She said she traveled by private bus to Sweden because of an ear
infection, and when they got to the border they were waved through.
   The next thing Ms. Minnelli knew, two Swedish customs officials
were knocking at the hotel door, demanding that Lilly be
quarantined or face deportation. Lilly remained under house arrest
at the Grand Hotel in Stockholm before being put on a plane for
Paris.
   Ms. Minnelli paid a fine for breaking the law before leaving
Stockholm. ``The law is the law,'' she said.

   The first newspaper account of George
Washington's inauguration failed to sell at a Sotheby's auction
Tuesday timed to coincide with the bicentennial celebration
surrounding Washington's swearing-in.
   The May 2, 1789 issue of the Gazette was the ``solitary
disappointment'' of the sale, which otherwise brought in $1.4
million _ more than twice the pre-sale expectations, Sotheby's said
in a statement.
   The top item was an 1855 letter from Abraham Lincoln about his
U.S. Senate defeat, which sold for $77,000 to Chicago dealer Ralph
G. Newman. It was expected to bring at least $25,000.
   Newman also bought an autograph letter of Davy Crockett
concerning a ``true history'' of his life for $20,900. Its pre-sale
estimate was between $10,000 and $15,000.
   All prices include Sotheby's 10 percent commission.
   The Gazette account of Washington's April 25, 1789 inauguration
in lower Manhattan was expected to bring at least $10,000, but
bidding stopped at $4,500 and the item was pulled.
   ``The market for early American newspapers at auction is not a
large one,'' said Sotheby's printed book expert, Selby Kiffer.
   Among the other Washington-related items, a 12-page excerpt from
the diary of the man who served as Washington's secretary from 1786
to 1793 sold for $9,350, less than its pre-sale estimate of at
least $15,000.
   It provides, among other entries, a version of Washington's
memories of Benedict Arnold's treason in 1780.
   Two Washington letters also were sold: a 1780 letter to Gen.
Nathanael Greene commending his Revolutionary War service and a
1796 letter to John Marshall.
   Both letters had pre-sale estimates of at least $9,000. The
Greene letter sold for $23,100 to Maurice Neville, a
California-based dealer.
   The Marshall letter sold for $19,800. The name of the buyer was
not available, Sotheby's said.

   He weighs a half-ton, squeals a lot and
tries to bite the hands that feed him because his eyesight is poor.
   But that hasn't stopped 300 people statewide from offering a
home to Grunt the abandoned pig, Los Angeles County animal control
officials said Tuesday.
   ``We've had everything from a guy in Lomita who lived in an
apartment and thought the pig would be a cute pet to a man in
Northern California with a 400-acre pig farm who wants to use the
pig as a stud. That would be my choice,'' said animal control Sgt.
James Bay.
   Grunt has been at the department's shelter here the past week,
since he was taken from affluent Rolling Hills Estates, where his
owners abandoned him because they were moving.
   They gave their gardener permission to butcher him, but Grunt
was saved from becoming bacon when his frightened squeals alerted
neighbors.
   Since then, the 4-foot Grunt and his girth have appeared in
newspapers and on television, prompting about 300 calls from
Californians wanting to give the 3-year-old porker a home. One
offer included the Los Angeles County Fair, which keeps farm
animals year-round and wanted to exhibit Grunt.
   Bay said supervisors have made a decision on Grunt's fate but
wouldn't be announcing it immediately.
   Until then, ``He's just eating and having a good time.''

<HEAD>Cheating Beats Embargo, But South African Arms Growth Falls</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: EMBARGOED for release at 4 a.m. EDT. Time set by source</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The 25-year-old arms embargo against
South Africa has been beaten by cheating, smuggling and legal
loopholes but still has stunted the growth of South Africa's
military, a book published today asserts.
   The study by Signe Landgren of the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute says that although the South African arms
industry claims to be self-sufficient, it ``owes its existence to
foreign technology,'' most of it acquired legally.
   ``Arms and, increasingly, production know-how, have continued to
reach South Africa, coming from the very Western countries that
agreed in the United Nations to abide by the arms embargo
restrictions,'' Landgren says in the book ``Embargo
Disimplemented.''
   The book lists the United States, Britain, West Germany, Japan,
France, Israel and Italy as having been among the most helpful.
   Landgren said that no matter how inefficient, the embargo
remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on
South Africa and is valuable as a statement condemning the
country's apartheid system of racial segregation.
   In the latest example of Pretoria's cloak-and-dagger
acquisitions, French police arrested three members of a Northern
Irish Protestant militia and a U.S. businessman on Saturday. Police
said the four were delivering stolen parts of a British-made
Blowpipe missile launcher to a South African diplomat.
   British news reports said the state-owned Armscor, the Armaments
Corp. of South Africa, apparently supplied small arms or cash to
Protestant extremists in exchange for blueprints of sophisticated
British weaponry.
   The United Nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo on South
Africa on Aug. 7, 1963 and made it mandatory in 1977. Sanctions
were tightened in 1984 with a resolution discouraging countries
from buying South African-produced weapons.
   The ban often was ineffective and had the countereffect of
spurring the South Africans to build up their own arms industry,
the study said.
   But it also deprived Pretoria of updated weapons systems,
restricted its access to new technologies and curtailed the supply
of spare parts.
   The embargo ``has been a limiting factor to some extent in South
Africa's efforts to expand its military strength,'' says the study,
citing U.S. congressional testimony.
   The study also quotes a 1985 U.N. report that says buying
smuggled or black market weapons added 20 to 100 percent to the
country's arms procurement costs.
   Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies,
using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations at
sea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, it says.
   The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian
products which have military applications, such as electronics and
telecommunications gear, the study says.
   Nuclear technology was one area where the embargo failed to stop
South African advances, it says.
   It reports that by the time the United Nations ordered a halt to
nuclear cooperation in 1977, South Africa had acquired
weapons-grade expertise to go with its vast uranium resources, the
world's second largest reserves.
   ``Its possession of nuclear weapons remains an open question,
but its capacity to produce such weapons is equal to that of almost
any industrial nation in Europe,'' the book says.
   Unlike Western restrictions on technology transfers to the
Soviet bloc, no multinational organization exists to monitor the
embargo against South Africa and there is no list of banned goods
to guide enforcement, Landgren wrote.
   The 16-nation, Paris-based Coordinating Committee for
Multinational Export Control _ COCOM _ set up in 1948, has a
300,000-item list of military contraband, which could be applied
against South Africa, Landgren said.
   South Africa's arms production capability was acquired through
licensing agreements and by buying stakes in arms-making
multinational companies, the study says.
   In 1963, South Africa said it had 120 foreign licenses. Before
the embargo became obligatory 14 years later, Pretoria gained
licenses to produce weapons systems like the French Mirage
jetfighter, the Israeli Reshef gunboat and the Scorpion sea
missile, also Israeli.
   Equipped with the technology, the South Africans could continue
production after the franchises were withdrawn.
   One classic case of a clandestine acquisition was the G-5
artillery piece, based on howitzers obtained from the U.S.-owned
Space Research Corp. in Quebec, Canada and the Belgian Poudreries
Reunis de Belgique.
   The G-5 deal involved contacts through a CIA agent and Israeli
intermediaries. South Africa bought a Dutch-based firm and created
dummy companies in Liechtenstein, Barbados and Canada.
   The first shells were bought from West Germany, bound for Spain
and redirected to South Africa. Production lathes for the guns came
from France, and the shell fillings were imported from West Germany
by way of Paraguay and Brazil. The G-5 technology was later
re-exported to Iran.

<HEAD>Christians Reported To Have New Missiles In War With Syrians</HEAD>

   The Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main
militia, have obtained six surface-to-surface missiles from Iraq
capable of hitting the Syrian capital of Damascus, Christian
sources report.
   But the Christians, besieged in their coastal enclave north of
Beirut, are not likely to use the Soviet-designed, Frog-7 missiles
except as a last resort lest they bring down the full weight of the
Syrians' formidable firepower.
   The Christians, led by army commander Gen. Michel Aoun, have
been battling the Syrians and their Moslem allies since March 8.
   No independent confirmation could be obtained that the
Christians acquired the missiles.
   But Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, is known to have provided the
Christians with T-54 tanks, multibarreled rocket launchers, armored
personnel carriers and other weapons in hope of bogging Syria down
in the Lebanese quagmire.
   The Christians and their foes have been fighting it out with
heavy artillery, rockets and giant mortars, wreaking widespread
destruction on both sides.
   More than 100,000 shells have rained on Beirut and its environs
at what military experts estimate is a cost of $70 million in
expended ammunition.
   Hundreds of buildings have been hit and, by police count, more
than 270 people killed and nearly 1,000 wounded. Despite Arab
League peace efforts, the carnage shows no sign of ending.
   The Frog missiles carry warheads containing 1,210 pounds of high
explosive and have a range of 43 miles. That's enough to reach
Damascus if the missiles were fired from mobile launchers in the
mountains that form the Christian enclave's eastern flank.
   A high-ranking Christian officer in the Lebanese army conceded
that six missiles ``are not a serious number'' and that the Frog-7s
``can hardly affect the military balance except for a momentary
transfer of the battle to the Syrian capital.''
   A senior source in the 6,000-strong Lebanese Forces noted, ``We
would use the Frogs only when we're completely cornered, because
Syria's retaliation will be one of total obliteration.''
   Both men spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The Syrians have about 40,000 troops based in Lebanon, mainly
Moslem sectors, under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Military experts in Beirut say that totals 15 percent of Syrian
military strength and 10 percent of its firepower.
   They estimate that the Syrians have used just 60 percent of
their firepower in Lebanon against the Christians and have not used
their large air force.
   Syria possibly fears aerial clashes with Israel, which patrols
Lebanese airspace at will and conducts retaliatory raids on targets
in Lebanon after attacks against Israeli targets.
   ``If the Syrians really wanted to pulverize the Christians, they
could do it,'' one Western military analyst noted. ``So far, they
have chosen not to. But what they have deployed can wear the
Christians down through attrition.''
   A Lebanese army officer commented, ``Some of the howitzers used
were designed to demolish bunkers and knock out runways.''
   He referred to the Soviet-made, S-23 180mm howitzer with a range
of 26 miles and firing a 187-pound shell.
   The M-1952 240mm Soviet-designed mortars used by the Syrians is
one of the more destructive weapons being employed.
   One 220-pound shell pierced the residence of Spanish Ambassador
Pedro Manuel de Aristegui this month, killing him and several
family members.
   Chief Warrant Officer Youssef Bitar, a veteran army explosives
officer in Lebanon's 14 years of civil war, said: ``The shell
penetrated two stone ceilings leaving a one-meter diameter hole in
each before exploding in the dining room where the family was
sitting.''
   Ordnance experts believe the shell was probably fired from
Syrian positions in Schweifat, two miles south of the ambassador's
residence.
   The Christians probably fear the Syrians' BM-21 ``Stalin
Organs'' the most.
   These mobile rocket launchers can spew out 40 122mm rockets in
20 seconds, enough to blast a whole city block with high explosives.
   ``It's like hell breaking loose on doomsday,'' said Zeina
Sweidan, a 23-year old interior designer, whose home in the
Christian district of Sin el-Fil was bracketed by a BM-21 salvo
recently.

   The gaping hole in Gayane Gasparian's skull is
healed and the 12-year-old girl was eager to return to Armenia. But
doctors say she faces an uncertain future in her
earthquake-shattered homeland.
   She and 9-year-old Artjom Gasparian, who is also heading home
today after medical teatment here, probably will end up living in
makeshift housing, possibly even tents, doctors said.
   ``It's hard,'' Dr. Nishan G. Goudsouzian said. ``They don't know
what's waiting for them at the end of the line.''
   They are among 14 children returning to the Soviet Union today,
two months after U.S. doctors brought them from Armenia for
treatment of injuries they suffered in December's devastating
earthquake.
   They leave behind 23 other children who require additional care.
   The children, ages 9 to 14, were brought to hospitals in
Massachusetts, New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Missouri by
Project Hope, after a team of doctors who visited victims of the
earthquake selected them for advanced care.
   A day before her scheduled departure, Gayane danced in the lobby
of Massachusetts General Hospital shouting ``Armenia, Armenia!''
   In February, Gayane had a large hole in her skull with just a
thin patch of skin protecting part of her brain. Doctors grafted
skull from the back of her head onto her forehead.
   Artjom, who is not related to Gayane, arrived at Massachusetts
General with two badly crushed legs. The boy's grandmother, who
shielded him while he was buried underneath rubble for four days,
died from her injuries.
   ``In the beginning when they told me to stand up, I was scared,
I had no muscles,'' said Artjom, speaking through an interpreter.
``But now I can stand up.''
   Artjom walked into a room at the hospital barely using one
crutch. Doctors said he would have to learn to walk again because
of a lack of wheelchair facilities in Armenia.
   Gayane, Artjom and their mothers stayed in Armenian-American
homes in nearby Watertown during their treatment. They attended an
Armenian school where Gayane learned the English alphabet, doctors
said.
   Gayane still needs plastic surgery to reconstruct three missing
fingers on her right hand. She hopes to return to this country for
the surgery but for now is looking forward to returning home,
doctors said.
   Goudsouzian, chief of pediatric anesthesiology, said Gayane
spent hours kissing pictures of a brother who died in the quake,
which killed more than 25,000 people and left many thousands
homeless.
   The returning children will be treated at a new outpatient
clinic established in Yerevan, Armenia, to track the quake victims.

<HEAD>Cambridge Today Remembers A Great Philosopher</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   He was an architect and a hospital porter, an
aeronautical engineer and a sculptor, a decorated soldier and a
monastery gardener.
   Ludwig Wittgenstein also was one of the century's greatest
philosophers, and today, on the centennial of his birth, his memory
is being celebrated at Cambridge University, where he was professor
of philosophy.
   Wittgenstein conferences are taking place in Austria and other
countries, while in Britain, where Wittgenstein became a
naturalized subject in 1938, the highlight is today's concert at
Trinity College, Cambridge.
   ``We will have some Bruckner, Brahms and Schubert, and also
something by Josef Labor, an obscure composer, but Wittgenstein
liked him,'' said Nicholas Denyer, a teaching fellow in philosophy
at Trinity.
   Wittgenstein's complex theories of language, thought patterns
and logic led to the conclusion that everything that mattered most
could not be put into words.
   ``He is regarded as difficult to understand,'' says Denyer.
``His ideas are of such interest that they have attracted more
commentaries and expository works than most 20th-century
philosophers. He remains a controversial figure, and a lot of
issues he opened up in his later work are still being explored.''
   Wittgenstein was born in Vienna on April 26, 1889, and spent his
last 22 years at Cambridge. Three of his four brothers committed
suicide, and he lived on the edge of madness and suicide until
cancer killed him in 1951, at age 62.
   ``He was extraordinary,'' said Christopher Sykes, a film
producer who explored Wittgenstein's life in a film broadcast by
the BBC last week.
   ``He was a pretty good architect, an aeronautical engineer who
invented a jet system not long after the Wright brothers first
flew, a logician and philosopher of amazing talent, a fearless and
multidecorated soldier in World War I, a village schoolmaster, a
monastery gardener's assistant, a sculptor, hospital porter in
World War II and Cambridge professor,'' Sykes said in an interview.
   ``People who knew Wittgenstein described him as good looking,
striking, not very tall, with deep hyacinth-blue eyes, of military
bearing, aristocratic,'' he said.
   Most of Wittgenstein's only book published during his lifetime,
``Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' was written under fire on the
eastern front and completed in an Italian prisoner-of-war camp. It
proposed the idea of a logically perfect or ideal language, the
prototype of which he saw in mathematical logic.
   Seven other works were published after his death.
   His mentor, the British philosopher Bertrand Russell, said that
when he read the first sentence a Wittgenstein essay, ``I became
persuaded that he was a man of genius.''
   Wittgenstein was not really at home in the 20th century.
   ``Wittgenstein never married,'' said Sykes. ``He liked solitude,
in a log cabin he built in Norway, in a hut in Galway on the west
coast of Ireland and on the Gower Peninsula in Wales.''
   ``He liked detective stories and the cinema, especially
Westerns. He always sat in the front row so there would be nothing
in his field of vision except the screen, to try to free his mind
of the philosophical questions that troubled him.''

<HEAD>Dingell Vows to Go After `Scammers and Schemers' of the Elderly</HEAD>
<TEXT>

<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The elderly are inadequately protected from
medical insurance frauds, House Commerce Committee Chairman John D.
Dingell said today while vowing to introduce legislation that would
tighten enforcement.
   ``There will always be scammers and schemers, but we needn't
make their job so easy,'' Dingell declared in a statement kicking
off a hearing of the oversight and investigations subcommittee he
also heads.
   ``Taking advantage of old people is easy,'' he said. ``It is
also reprehensible. It must stop.''
   The Michigan Democrat _ who called state insurance regulators,
prosecutors, and members of elderly advocacy groups before the
panel _ acknowledged that insurance regulation can be highly
technical.
   ``But when regulations are policies are writen in terms that
only a select few can understand, the public has been hoodwinked,''
he said. ``No amount of legalistic babble can obfuscate the fact
that elderly people are being skinned and that the law is not
protecting them.''
   Dingell released the results of a General Accounting Office
study of the amount of claims paid out by hospital indemnity
policies compared with the amount of premiums collected.
   Using 1987 statistics, it showed an average loss ratio of 52.7
for 37 policies _ meaning the companies paid out nearly 53 cents of
every dollar collected in premiums.
   He had released another GAO study two weeks ago that showed only
marginally better payouts for Medigap policies sold to supplement
coverage under the giant Medicare health program for America's 33
million elderly and disabled.
   While Medigap plans cover such things as the one-day hospital
deductible not paid by Medicare, indemnity policies are those that
pay the beneficiary a certain amount of cash for each day
hospitalized.
   ``Simply put, hospital indemnity plans are not really medical
insurance, just a bad gamble for older persons,'' James P. Firman,
president of United Seniors Health Cooperative, told the
subcommittee in testimony submitted in advance.
   ``Hospital indemnity plans have always been a bad deal for older
persons,'' said Firman. ``Now, with improved hospital coverage
under Medicare, hospital indemnity plans do not cover any
significant risk faced by most older persons.''
   Earl R. Pomeroy, the North Dakota Commissioner of Insurance and
vice president of the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, told the subcommittee the association has already
revised the minimum standards required by Medigap policies to take
into account the expanded coverage under the expansion of Medicare
last summer to include catastrophic illness care.
   However, Pomeroy said, the restructuring of the private policies
has not meant a corresponding decrease in premiums for the private
policies purchased by more than two-thirds of Medicare
beneficiaries.
   ``Several factors have wiped out any refunds or credits and in
fact are contributing to net increases in the premiums on the
existing business,'' said Pomeroy. ``The factors ... are the length
of time since the last premium increase, recent loss ratio
performance, increase in utilization and in price of medical
services and addition of new benefits to the policies.''

   House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich says he
doesn't feel snared by his own trap, despite similarities between
the ethics complaint against him and the charges he instigated
against House Speaker Jim Wright.
   ``I knew full well that this issue might well come up when I
filed charges against Jim Wright,'' Gingrich said Tuesday,
referring to the complaint Rep. Bill Alexander, D-Ark., filed
against him with the House ethics committee. ``I knew full well the
intensity and savagery of the Democratic response.''
   The complaint, filed earlier this month, alleges 10 violations
of House rules in a partnership set up in 1984 to promote sales of
``Window of Opportunity,'' a book co-authored by Gingrich, his
wife, Marianne Gingrich, and political associate David Drake.
   Many of the investors in the partnership were Republican
political activists who later obtained tax writeoffs from the
arrangement.
   Gingrich and his wife, who was the general partner of COS
Limited Partnership, released hundreds of pages of documents
Tuesday and then appeared together at a news conference in an
effort to lay to rest the charges outlined in Alexander's complaint.
   But the news conference turned stormy as reporters persisted
with questions about the parallels between the ethics problems
facing Wright and those confronting Gingrich. Mrs. Gingrich, upset
by the questions, walked out of the room midway through the session.
   ``What we did, we did legally correct, we did ethically correct,
we did it out in the open and it is above board,'' Gingrich said,
``and I think that's a huge difference between us and Jim Wright.''
   The partnership involved 18 individuals and three corporations
that put up $5,000 each to promote the book, in exchange for a
promise of half of the publisher's profits. But the partnership
reported more than $100,000 in losses from 1984 to 1988, and those
losses were divided among the partners for tax writeoffs.
   Gingrich acknowledged that some of the partners had a direct
interest in legislation, and his office handled routine requests
for some of them. But he denied that he provided any of the
partners ``unusual or extraordinary personal help'' with any
problem they had with the federal government.
   House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts worth more
than $100 from persons with direct interest in legislation, but
Gingrich said the $5,000 each investor put into the deal did not
constitute a gift because each one ``thought there was a reasonable
chance that it might make money.''
   Gingrich and his wife each earned $7,018 in royalties on the
book, under a contract that provided the three authors with a total
royalty of 10 percent on hardback sales and 8 percent on paperback
sales.
   Gingrich said the arrangements surrounding his book may have
been unusual, but they were not unethical. In comparison, he said,
Wright's bulk book sales were unethical.
   Wright is charged with violating House rules limiting outside
income by arranging bulk sales of his book to special-interest
groups in lieu of speaking fees. Book sales are not covered by the
income limits, while speaking fees are.
   ``We wrote a real book, working with a real publisher,
distributed to real bookstores and sold to real people for a
realistic, standard royalty,'' Gingrich said. ``Jim Wright did none
of those things.''
   Gingrich also said that his wife's work for the partnership was
more substantial than that done by Wright's wife in a business
arrangement that prompted several ethics charges against the
speaker.
   ``She actually did the work for the money she got,'' Gingrich
said of his wife. He said the 350 pages of tax returns,
incorporation papers, and financial records released Tuesday
represent her work for the partnership.
   As general partner, she received a $10,000 payment in 1984 for
setting up the partnership, and later received a 2 percent interest
in the partnership and another $1,500 payment for her work.

<TEXT>
   Andre Previn's resignation as musical
director forces the Los Angeles Philharmonic to hunt for a new
conductor at a time when other major orchestras are trying to fill
vacancies.
   His decision to leave his $500,000-plus-a-year job was announced
Tuesday amid reports of artistic disagreements with Music Center
Executive Director Ernest Fleischmann. But Previn will continue as
guest conductor with the orchestra for several more years.
   Previn's resignation is the latest change to unsettle the
symphonic world, which on Monday learned that 81-year-old Herbert
von Karajan was stepping down as director of the celebrated Berlin
Philharmonic. Among the others searching is the New York
Philharmonic. The Chicago Symphony recently appointed Daniel
Barenboim to replace Sir Georg Solti.
   ``I have decided that, in the current structure of the Los
Angeles Philharmonic, it has become obvious to me there is no room
for a music director,'' the 60-year-old Previn told the board,
according to a statement from the philharmonic Tuesday.
   The resignation is effective at season's end.
   Previn, who became music director in 1986, clashed with
Fleischmann over guest conductors on recordings, how Previn edited
musical works _ even cutbacks on office supplies and coffee.
   The Los Angeles Philharmonic said a search for a new music
director would begin immediately.
   It took the San Diego Symphony 14 months before finding a
replacement for David Atherton. On Tuesday, the orchestra announced
the appointment of Israeli conductor Yoav Talmi as music director.
   The Berlin orchestra is already searching for a conductor to
replace Karajan, who is quitting for medical reasons. Zubin Mehta,
who once headed the Los Angeles Philharmonic, has announced his
resignation from the New York Philharmonic.
   Previn said he planned to conduct the Los Angeles orchestra as
guest conductor for seven weeks next season and six weeks each for
the 1990-91 and 1991-92 seasons.
   ``Because of my love for the orchestra, I am perfectly happy to
continue making music with them,'' he said.
   He also will take up the baton for some recordings, a May 1990
U.S. tour, and for the opening concert of the Carnegie Hall
centennial season in September 1990.
   Previn, an Oscar-winning composer and conductor, stepped down as
the Pittsburgh Symphony music director for the Los Angeles post. He
left Pittsburgh because he reportedly was unhappy about a lack of
support for his ``artistic goals.''
   Fleischmann had sought him for the job to replace Carlo Maria
Giulini.
   Previn began his composing career at MGM studios at age 16, and
eventually wrote scores for more than 30 movies.
   He won Oscars for ``Gigi'' (1958), ``Porgy and Bess,'' (1959),
``Irma La Douce,'' (1963) and ``My Fair Lady,'' (1964).
   He also has won seven Grammys, has recorded on several labels,
and led many of the top orchestras of the United States and Europe
during his career.
   During his tenure as music director, the philharmonic made 10
records, and toured Japan in the fall 1988. He also took the
orchestra on various domestic tours.

<HEAD>US, Anti-Sandinistas Say Election Being Rigged</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The State Department is joining a delegation
of Nicaraguan opposition leaders in accusing Sandinista authorities
of trying to rig national elections set for next February.
   The opposition leaders, ranging from an anti-Sandinista
communist to U.S.-backed Contra rebels, said Tuesday that
Nicaraguan officials are attempting to ensure victory by stacking
the all-powerful Supreme Electoral Council in their favor and by
denying the opposition equal access to media outlets.
   The State Department leveled similar charges and appealed to the
Sandinistas to meet opposition demands for a more equitable process.
   At issue is legislation approved by recently by the
Sandinista-dominated legislature setting forth ground rules for the
elections.
   Tuesday was the deadline, established at a Central American
summit meeting last February in El Salvador, for setting in motion
an electoral process that will culminate in national elections 10
months from now.
   Nicaraguan Embassy spokeswoman Cecilia Lopez said the new laws
were approved with the participation of the political parties
represented in the legislature and are in compliance with the terms
of the Central American summit.
   In a telephone interview, she said the law allows opposition
parties more air time for campaign purposes than they would have
received under their original request.
   In addition, she said, the Sandinistas, consistent with another
pledge made at the summit, have released about 1,700 National
Guardsmen who served the rightist regime which was ousted by the
Sandinistas a decade ago.
   Twelve opposition leaders outlined their criticisms at a news
conference after discussing the issue with United Nations and
Organization of American States officials.
   The delegates included Eli Altamirano of the Nicaraguan
Communist Party and three members of the U.S.-supported Contra
rebels.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
administration shares the criticisms of the opposition leaders.
   The electoral law approved last week ``is not the result of good
faith bargaining between the government of Nicaragua and the
internal opposition groups, and was unilaterally imposed after
being passed by the Sandinista-dominated legislature,'' she said.
   She said the law includes a provision requiring that the
election council which the Sandinistas control receive one-half of
any foreign political contributions.
   The law, she said, ignores proposals made by the internal
opposition for absentee balloting and procedures for ensuring
unlimited access for international election observers.
   A new law governing press conduct, she added, includes penalties
for disseminating information which the Interior Ministry
determines to be a violation of national integrity and allows
officials to order closures of up to four days.

<TEXT>
   A Justice Department brief defending the
administration's plan to test more than 1,500 White House employees
for drugs says two workers have been fired in the last 2{ years
because of illegal drugs.
   ``In one case the employee, a motor vehicle operator, tested
positive at a hospital for cocaine,'' says a declaration by Charles
Easley, the security officer for the Office of Administration. ``In
the second instance, an accounting technician was arrested for
possession of cocaine outside the complex shortly after departing
work.''
   Both employees were fired, Easley said in his declaration, which
is part of the Justice Department brief.
   The positions held by the two fired workers would be subject to
random drug testing under a plan originally proposed by the Reagan
White House and now being pursued by President Bush.
   The brief was filed late Monday in the U.S. District Court where
30 employees of the Executive Office of the President filed suit in
January to block the random drug tests as unnecessary and
unconstitutional.
   A hearing on the case is scheduled for May 11.
   There have been revelations earlier that two National Security
Council clerks resigned and there had been two resignations and two
firings in the Uniformed Division of the Secret Service stemming
from a drug investigation that surfaced last May.
   But there had been no previous mention of the two employees in
the Office of Administration the part of the Executive Office of
the President that provides administrative support to the rest.
   The plan calls for random drug testing of 1,520 of the 1,850
employees in the agencies in the Executive Office of the President,
including the Office of Management and Budget, the National
Security Council, the Council of Economic Advisers, the Council on
Environmental Quality and the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative.
   The Reagan White House announced last June 30 that everyone on
its payroll would be subject to random drug tests in 60 days. But
that program was held up by court challenges.
   The suit by the employees of the White House complex is one of
more than 50 suits filed by employees throughout the government to
stop drug testing.
   ``These are extremely loyal people, loyal to the president and
loyal to government administration,'' their American Civil
Liberties Union attorney, Jeffrey F. Liss, has said. ``They just
think random drug testing is unconstitutional, not justified, an
invasion of their privacy and demeaning.''
   The Justice Department in its brief cited two recent Supreme
Court decisions _ a 7-2 ruling in favor of testing of railroad
crews after accidents and a 5-4 ruling upholding a Customs Service
policy of testing applicants for law enforcement jobs _ in support
of the plan to test the executive office employees.
   The department also noted that those to be tested already had
willingly allowed extensive background checks in order to get their
sensitive jobs, thus voluntarily limited their right to privacy.
   ``The test involved here detracts little from their already
limited privacy rights,'' the brief says.
   The brief notes that the employees ``are the personal staff of
the president of the United States.''
   ``Just about all of these employees designated for random
testing have access to the president and the White House complex
... or to classified and@or sensitive information or to both,'' it
says.
   Their roles as advisers to the president and participants in the
development of domestic and foreign policies ``make random
urinalysis drug testing for such employees reasonable,'' the brief
says. ``Their regular access to highly sensitive or classified
information makes random drug testing a necessity.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said March 29 that
President Bush was displeased by the employees' suit, saying the
government must ensure ``a clean workplace.''

<HEAD>American in Costa Rica Said to Use Ranch for Drug, Arms Shipments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug planes used airstrips on the ranch of
John Hull in Costa Rica while the former Indiana resident helped a
secret U.S. operation to aid the Nicaraguan Contras, witnesses told
a Foreign Relations narcotics subcommittee.
   A Senate committee report on international drug trafficking says
five witnesses identified Hull as a participant in international
drug trafficking. Hull, whose property included airstrips, was
charged in Costa Rica last January with drug trafficking and
violating that nation's neutrality.
   The report said that in addition to his drug activities, Hull
also defrauded the Overseas Private Investment Corp. of $375,000
when he pocketed a loan for a wood products factory that never
produced anything.
   The report, obtained Tuesday from Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass.,
said only one of the five witnesses told the panel he personally
witnessed cocaine being loaded, in Hull's presence, onto planes
headed for the United States.
   The witness was identified as Gary Betzner, a drug smuggling
pilot serving a 27-year prison term for running a continuing
criminal enterprise for trafficking in cocaine.
   Another witness, Werner Lotz, said he heard about drug flights
to Hull's ranch from the Colombian and Panamanian pilots who
allegedly flew the planes.
   Lotz described the strips as refueling stops, and told the
subcommittee, according to the report, that Hull ``was paid'' for
allowing their use.
   Lotz, a Costa Rican, was convicted in the United States for
conspiracy to import drugs in 1985 and sentenced to four years in
prison. He was deported at the conclusion of his sentence to Costa
Rica.
   The report also said Hull and two associates applied for the
OPIC loan in 1983, saying they wanted to finance a ``joint venture
wood products factory that would make wheelbarrow and ax handles
for the U.S. market.'' The money was advanced on March 30, 1984.
   By the end of 1985, after one interest payment, the loan lapsed
into default, and OPIC officials ``began to recognize that the
project was a fraud, and that Hull had made false representations
in making the application to OPIC,'' the report said.
   The agency found, according to the report, that the money was
deposited in Hull's Indiana bank account and the funds withdrawn by
Hull in cash. Hull told OPIC that wanted the cash to buy Costa
Rican money on the black market to get a more favorable exchange
rate.
   ``In fact, Costa Rica has a favorable exchange rate for foreign
investment and the excuse Hull offered does not make sense,'' the
report said. ``What appears to have happened is that Hull simply
took the money, inasmuch as no equipment was purchased for the
factory, no products were shipped from it, and Hull's partner ...
testified that he never saw the money.''
   The Justice Department told the panel there's an ongoing
investigation into the loan.
   OPIC eventually tried to sell the property Hull put up for
collateral, but to prevent a sale far below the market price, OPIC
bought its own property for $187,500.
   Later, OPIC negotiated an agreement with a purchaser, who was
required to make no down payment, and to repay OPIC its $187,500
only from future proceeds of the sale of timber cut on the land.
   Hull was the focus of news reports during the unraveling of the
Iran-Contra affair citing the use of his ranch as a conduit for
arms to Nicaragua. There were also published reports at the time
that he was involved in drugs.

   A crippled United Airlines flight's crew worried
about staying aloft and boosted each other's spirits during the
harrowing return to Honolulu after their plane ripped open in
flight, according to a cockpit recording transcript released
Tuesday.
   The transcript was released as the National Transportation
Safety Board opened a hearing into why United Flight 811's cargo
door blew off, sucking nine passengers to their deaths and knocking
out two engines.
   Speculation has focused on the failure of a latch to work
properly, although the crew at first thought the damage might have
been caused by a bomb.
   The Federal Aviation Administration released its transcript of
recorded radio conversations between the airplane and the Honolulu
control tower earlier this month. The transcript of the cockpit
recording released Tuesday was the first indication of what crew
members said to each other during the 25-minute return to Honolulu.
   The Boeing 747 departed shortly before 2 a.m. HST on Feb. 24
from Honolulu, bound for Sydney, Australia, with 337 passengers and
18 crew. The flight was uneventful until 2:09 a.m., when pilot
David Cronin said: ``What the (expletive) was that?.''
   ``I don't know,'' replied first officer Al Slader, of Langley,
Va.
   Then there is the sound of a loud bang, and power to the
recording unit was interrupted for 21 seconds. There is the sound
of an alarm horn.
   ``Goin' down,'' Cronin of Incline Village, Nev., said, followed
by ``Emergency descent.''
   ``I think we blew a door ... or something,'' Slader says seconds
later.
   ``Tell the PA _ the, ah, flight attendant to get, ah, prepared
for an evacuation,'' Cronin said.
   The crew shut down the damaged No. 3 engine. Flight engineer
Mark Thomas of Albany, Ind., began dumping fuel as the plane limped
back to Honolulu.
   At 2:13 a.m., Cronin said: ``I think we might have some damage
out there.''
   ``We got a control problem here,'' Cronin said seconds later.
   At 2:14, Cronin noted a problem with the No. 4 engine, and the
crew discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines.
   ``Can you maintain 240 (knots)?'' Slader asked.
   ``Yeah, just barely,'' Cronin replied.
   ``Yeah, but we're losing altitude,'' Slader said.
   ``I know it,'' Cronin said.
   At 2:16, Thomas offered to go into the passenger cabin to check
the situation.
   Seconds later, Cronin announced no fuel flow to No. 4 engine.
   ``What a (expletive) of a thing to happen on your, ah, second to
last month,'' Slader told Cronin.
   ``No (expletive),'' Cronin, then 59 and on his second-to-last
flight, replied. Cronin retired 10 days later on reaching the
mandatory retirement age of 60.
   Immediately after, Slader noted a fire on the No. 4 engine.
   ``Go through the procedure, shut down the engine,'' Cronin said.
   ``We're not gonna be able to hold this altitude on two
(engines),'' Slader said.
   At 2:17, eight minutes after the trouble began, Thomas returned
to report the gaping hole.
   ``The right side is gone ... it's just open. You're just lookin
outside,'' Thomas said.
   ``Looks like a bomb,'' he said.
   ``Fuselage?'' Slader asked.
   ``Yes, fuselage, it's just open,'' Thomas said. ``Some people
are probably gone. I don't know.''
   After a six-second silence, the crew turned back to flying the
plane.
   At 2:19, Cronin told the tower they would ``like all the medical
equipment we can get.''
   Thomas warned against flying too fast because of the gaping
hole, and Slader wondered what the minimum airspeed was under the
circumstances.
   ``I wouldn't go below 240,'' he said.
   ``Is there a closer airport than this?'' Slader asked at 2:22.
   At 2:24, Cronin announced he couldn't hold altitude.
   ``OK don't, OK, ah well, we have 24 miles to go and we're
drifting down slowly ... '' Slader replied.
   ``You're gonna make it,'' Thomas said.
   ``Make sure we don't hit any (expletive) hills on the way,''
Slader added.
   At 2:24, Slader reported seeing the lights of the airport.
   ``OK ... we're 21 miles out and we're in good shape,'' Slader
said.
   At 2:25, Thomas began reading off the checklist for a two-engine
approach.
   ``I hear people screaming back there,'' Thomas said at 2:30.
   At 2:33 the plane's wheel touched the runway.
   At 2:34 a.m., Thomas signaled the evacuation of the plane. The
tape ended seconds later.

<HEAD>Star Wars Focus on Thousands of Tiny Satellites</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Star Wars research is focusing on a concept
called ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' consisting of thousands of satellites
under three feet long and designed to knock down enemy missiles,
says Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Cheney told Congress on Tuesday that he remains a strong
advocate of Star Wars, known formally as the Strategic Defense
Initiative, but is recommending that the budget for fiscal 1990 be
cut to $4.6 billion from the $5.9 billion proposed by former
President Reagan.
   He said President Bush ``believes very deeply that we need to go
forward with strategic defense.''
   Much SDI research will focus on the Brilliant Pebbles concept,
said Cheney, although SDI officials later said that weapon is one
of several space-based anti-missile satellites under consideration.
   The budget level for Star Wars ``will buy us the capability to
look aggressively at Brilliant Pebbles,'' said Cheney. ``If
Brilliant Pebbles does not work out, the ultimate deployment date
of the current space-based missile program would slip by two
years.'' He did not set a date.
   Plans call for the president and Congress to decide in 1993 or
1994 whether to go ahead with Star Wars, said Pentagon spokesmen.
Several years later, deployment could begin on the first elements,
surveillance satellites and ground-based missiles.
   Brilliant Pebbles drew backing from the outgoing SDI chief, Lt.
Gen. James Abrahamson, who predicted in a Feb. 9 memorandum that it
could be deployed in space for about $25 billion, far under
estimates of $45 billion for other SDI orbital systems.
   The concept calls for between 3,000 and 5,000 satellites, about
three feet long and weighing less than 100 pounds apiece, to be
placed in orbit up to 400 miles above the earth, according to
retired Lt. Gen. Daniel O. Graham, a strong backer of Star Wars.
   Each satellite would be housed in a protective cocoon, called a
``life jacket,'' from which it would be ejected in time of war. If
everything worked, sensors aboard the satellites would spot and
track enemy boosters, and rockets would propel the ``pebbles''
toward the boosters, destroying them before they could release
their warheads.
   The other space-based interceptor (SBI) under consideration
calls for several hundred satellites, each armed with about a dozen
interceptors, which would be fired at enemy boosters.
   Brilliant Pebbles and SBI rely on a Boost Surveillance and
Tracking Satellite, in high earth orbit, designed to spot boosters
at launch.
   Brilliant Pebbles is the brainchild of Lowell Wood, a physicist
at the federal Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California. He is a
protege of Edward Teller, who is known as the father of the
hydrogen bomb and helped persuade Reagan to launch his Star Wars
campaign.
   Cheney's remarks drew applause from SDI backers and skepticism
from Star Wars critics, who note that any space-based system would
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and thus lead to a
new round in the arms race.
   Graham, the head of the pro-Star Wars lobbying group High
Frontier, said he was ``delighted'' by Cheney's remarks.
   Critics noted that the Pentagon has done relatively little work
so far on Brilliant Pebbles.
   ``The fundamental problem is that there is no `there' there. At
this point it is just a neat idea,'' said John Pike, director of
space research for the Federation of American Scientists.
   ``I think it is entirely premature for the administration to be
making the claim that this will pan out,'' said Pike, calling
Cheney's remarks ``a triumph of faith over fact.''
   SDI is spending $40 million on Brilliant Pebbles this year, a
tiny fraction of its overall budget and only 10 percent of the $400
million it is spending on two ground-based interceptors that would
likely also be deployed in any anti-missile defense.
   The Brilliant Pebbles budget for fiscal 1990 has not been
disclosed, but an SDI spokesman, Maj. Alan Freitag, said ``we
certainly take our direction from the secretary of defense and the
administration. Technology will also be a determining factor.''
   SDI spokesmen stressed that Brilliant Pebbles was just one
possible component in a system that would include layers of
surveillance satellites, space-based kill vehicles and ground-based
anti-missile missiles.
   ``It's just one element among space-based interceptors that we
are looking at,'' Col. Louis Seelig, the SDI comptroller, told
reporters.
   Brilliant Pebbles is not what SDI officials call a ``mature
technology,'' on which much research has been done, said Capt.
Bruce Jackson, another SDI spokesman. But ``it is probably an
advanced concept that we could bring to fruition quickly'' and at a
lower cost than other versions.
   The SDI director, Lt. Gen. George L. Monahan Jr., is scheduled
to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee next Tuesday
to explain exactly how the lower budget proposal would affect SDI
research through fiscal 1990.

   The Rose Garden is one of the most
meticulously kept and manicured tracts of real estate anywhere, but
President Bush views it as another chunk of ``mother earth.''
   Nearing the 100-day mark in his presidency, Bush has been making
active use of the White House grounds _ especially now that the
weather lends itself to outdoor pursuits.
   ``I wish that all of you who love nature and love the earth _
mother earth _ could have been with (Agriculture Secretary) Clayton
Yeutter and me as we walked through the beautiful Rose Garden area
of the White House,'' Bush told a radio audience.
   ``It is at its most beautiful this time of year. And I get a
kick out of seeing all the tourists from Middle America and
agricultural America and everyplace coming to the people's house,''
he said during a recent broadcast sponsored by the Agriculture
Department.
   And while the 18-acre estate hardly qualifies as the Great
Outdoors, Bush is the latest in a string of presidents and their
families to enjoy the grounds since Thomas Jefferson first obtained
funds to fence them in.
   Woodrow Wilson grazed sheep on the rolling South Lawn during
World War I. An early photograph shows Benjamin Harrison posing
there with his grandson and a pet goat.
   Caroline Kennedy rode Macaroni, her pony, on the grounds. Amy
Carter had a tree hut.
   Herbert Hoover played medicine ball outside with his Cabinet.
Harry Truman pitched horseshoes _ an outdoor sport that Bush has
revived.
   Theodore Roosevelt, whom Bush sometimes refers to as a role
model, established the first tennis courts.
   Gerald Ford had an outdoor swimming pool built and swam there.
   Franklin Roosevelt did calisthenics on the White House lawn as
secretary of the Navy in Wilson's Cabinet.
   Rutherford Hayes marked off a croquet court. Warren Harding and
Dwight Eisenhower practiced golf shots on the lawns.
   The Rose Garden, which sits right outside the Oval Office, has
been a popular spot for Bush, who has been using it extensively in
recent weeks _ to honor championship basketball teams and volunteer
groups and to welcome foreign dignitaries.
   The recently negotiated budget agreement was announced in the
Rose Garden. And Bush used it for launching his $441 million
education package and for signing a bipartisan agreement on Contra
aid.
   The Rose Garden was also well used by other presidents.
   Gerald Ford ``campaigned'' for re-election from the Rose Garden
in 1976. And Ronald Reagan used it frequently for receptions and
ceremonies.
   The White House grounds are also the site for dog walks, now as
in past presidencies.
   ``Think of the deficit reduction as exercise: like walking the
dog every day,'' Bush told a California audience on Tuesday.
``Believe me, I know. Exercise keeps you at the top of your game.''
   That may be so, but if truth be known, Barbara Bush is the one
who usually walks first dog Millie on the White House grounds.
   Ever since Eisenhower first used the South Lawn as a landing pad
for helicopters, presidents have begun and ended trips there. Bush
is no exception.
   Coming home from their most recent weekend at the presidential
retreat in Camp David, Md., the president and Mrs. Bush stepped
from their helicopter and walked toward the White House. First dog
Millie was on hand and bolted away from a group of greeters toward
the president, who outstreched his arms.
   The dog zoomed right past Bush and stopped lovingly at the feet
of Mrs. Bush.
   Another recent vignette outside the White House was also played
without words.
   It was a crisp spring morning as Bush began his current four-day
trip across the country with a helicopter ride from the South Lawn
of the White House to nearby Andrews Air Force Base, the way he
starts all trips.
   First staff members, then the Bushes, boarded the helicopter,
known as Marine One. He gave a wave and the doors of the craft
swung shut. Its rotors began to whirl faster and faster _ and then
stopped.
   Something was wrong. The takeoff had been delayed. The several
dozen onlookers looked around expectantly. What was wrong?
   Then, all eyes swung to the right, where a solitary figure in a
business suit was hurrying across the lawn, clutching a brief case.
   The red-faced official looked disbelievingly at his watch,
shaking his head, huffing and puffing toward the waiting helicopter.
   A door swung open and a tardy chief of staff John Sununu climbed
aboard.

   The Bush administration pledged cooperation
with the successor to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, but analysts
say Japan's next government may be too weak to deal with the United
States on trade and other issues.
   Regardless of who succeeds Takeshita, U.S.-Japanese
relationships will be marked by disputes over Japan's $50 billion
trade imbalance, pressures in Congress for Japan to contribute more
to its own defense and Japanese criticism of the U.S. deficit.
   The resignation also leaves the troubled FSX fighter-plane deal
hanging at least until a successor to Takeshita takes office.
   ``We will continue to work closely with the new prime minister
and the new government,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said upon receiving news of the resignation Monday.
   And State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler emphasized to
reporters on Tuesday that U.S. relations with Japan remain strong.
   Ms. Tutwiler noted that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
had a ``close, personal, warm friendship'' with Takeshita. Baker
``will miss his good friend,'' she said.
   Baker worked closely with Takeshita when they both served as
their respective governments' chief financial officers.
   In remarks that hinted at the difficulties that may lie ahead,
House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., lauded Takeshita for
his courage in helping carry out trade agreements that were viewed
unfavorably at home.
   ``The decisions to import more American beef and citrus were
very deeply offensive to Japanese farmers and created a very
negative political reaction in Japan,'' Foley said.
   The congressman said he believed it may be ``extremely
difficult'' for the United States to win any further trade
concessions from Japan until a strong government is able to come to
power.
   Takeshita, linked to an influence-peddling scandal, has
announced his resignation but his successor and the timing of his
departure remain unclear. In the meantime, it appears possible an
elder politician might become interim prime minister.
   This could create some short-term uncertainties in the
relationship, analysts said.
   ``In the broadest sense, the effect will be of a weakened
government being unable to take bold actions,'' said Robert
Scalapino of the Asian Studies Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley.
   Scalapino, who specializes in Japanese political and security
issues, said the move toward a caretaker government or even one led
by an elder statesman means it will be difficult for the Japanese
to meet U.S. demands for any changes in policy, be it in trade,
defense or economic matters.
   ``A weak government can't support bold, new policies,'' he said.
   Susan Pharr, director of the Program on U.S.-Japan Relations at
Harvard University, struck a similar tone.
   ``It sets back U.S.-Japan relations, because it could slow
things down for a while,'' said Ms. Pharr, a professor of
government at Harvard. ``It's not a major setback, but it's not the
best situation you could hope for, either.''
   Ms. Pharr said that without a strong leader in place in Japan,
the country's bureaucracy tends to exert more influence.
   ``It doesn't help speed things along,'' she said. ``We want
things to happen more quickly than they will happen,'' she said.
   Paul Volcker, who worked closely with Japanese economic
officials during his eight years as chairman of the Federal
Reserve, said he did not believe Takeshita's resignation will have
any lasting impact on U.S.-Japan relations.
   ``It is not helpful to have a Japanese government leaderless for
a period of time, but I am not sure that is going to happen,'' he
said.
   Former Japanese Ambassador Yoshio Okawara predicted that the
policies of the current government, which have included significant
support to the United States in such areas as Third World debt,
would be continued by the caretaker government chosen to succeed
Takeshita.
   But he added that ``during this unstable political situation, no
new initiatives can be taken.''

<HEAD>Ordinance Would Recognize Homosexual `Marriages'</HEAD>

   Larry Brinkin couldn't take a leave from
his job after the death of his homosexual lover of 11 years, but a
proposed law would give him and other city employees the same
bereavement leave as married couples.
   The measure proposed Tuesday effectively would redefine the
family by legally equating homosexual and unmarried relationships
with marriage for 24,000 municipal employees.
   ``The legal world must reflect the realities that exist in our
private existences,'' said Supervisor Harry Britt, who wrote the
``domestic partnership'' legislation. ``Both gay people and
unmarried heterosexuals have been denied the fundamental right to
live in love and happiness.''
   A narrower version of the legislation was vetoed by then-Mayor
Dianne Feinstein in 1982. She called it too vague.
   But this time, Mayor Art Agnos endorsed the measure from the
start and eight members of the 11-seat Board of Supervisors signed
on as co-sponsors. The ordinance will be heard before a city
committee on May 11.
   If approved, it would be the most far-reaching measure of its
kind, although three California cities, Berkeley, Santa Cruz and
West Hollywood, allow municipal employees to add partners to health
benefit and pension plans.
   The ordinance would ban discrimination by any city agency
against people because of the non-traditional relationship status.
It also requires that steps be taken to extend many benefits to
people in committed relationships that now are provided only to
married people, including dependent health care and legal standing
in housing contracts.
   ``The message is that San Francisco is a place where it is
understood that the family unit, even if it is non-traditional, is
paramount to our lives in terms of our survival, the support we
need, to keep us free from loneliness, to help us economically,''
said Brinkin, who unsuccessfully sued his former employer, Southern
Pacific, over the denied leave.
   Although the ordinance would not apply to the private sector,
the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce announced it would begin a
study of the issue with the aim of informing businesses what
benefits they should offer employees in such relationships.
   Britt's measure would require domestic partners to have a joint
home and to share basic living expenses, although each could
maintain a second home. They also must register with City Hall or,
for those wishing confidentiality, with a notarized statement filed
with an independent third party, such as a private attorney.
   The measure has been criticized by some religious groups.
   The San Francisco Roman Catholic Archdiocese will not support
``any effort to weaken the institution of marriage, to tinker with
it, or put any parallel system alongside it,'' said spokesman
Norman Phillips.
   But Tom DiMaria, of the Washington-based National Gay and
Lesbian Task Force, called domestic partnership a ``fundamental
requirement'' for homosexuals to be accepted by society.
   ``This tells people that gay and lesbian relationships are a
viable, healthy and acceptable new form of the traditional
family,'' DiMaria said.
   The measure directs a city task force to examine all city
policies and practices to identify those that put non-married
couples at a disadvantage.
   Eventually, homosexual and unmarried heterosexual partners could
have legal standing in real estate and rental contracts and could
become eligible for rental and housing programs offered now only to
traditionally families. Sick leave for city employees whose lovers
or parents are seriously ill also would be expanded.
   Partners also would have hospital and jail visitation rights
similar to traditional family members.
   By city charter, supervisors can only ask the city's Health
Services System, an independent agency that runs city hospitals,
clinics and health benefit programs, to extend benefits to domestic
partners. With Agnos as mayor, Britt hopes the department's
compliance will be routine.
   If adopted, San Francisco would be the only major metropolitan
city with such a measure. Several other cities, including
Washington, D.C., and Madison, Wis., currently are studying the
issue.
   West Hollywood, which has a large homosexual population, also
offers a domestic partnership certificate, and 219 couples have
registered since 1985.

   Nine members of Congress warned in a letter to
the House Budget Committee chairman that a proposed reduction in
NASA's budget could so cripple the U.S. space station that
``cancellation becomes a real option.''
   The letter, sent to Rep. Leon E. Panetta, D-Calif., on Tuesday
said that a Senate resolution calling for a $1.3 billion reduction
in budget authority for general science and space would be absorbed
largely by reducing the amount allocated for Space Station Freedom.
   Cutting the station, the letter said, would be ``tragic'' for
the country because it would affect the nation's ability to produce
and utilize new technology that could be developed in space.
   ``It is imperative that we are not penny-wise and pound foolish
with our civil space program,'' said the letter. ``The
competitiveness of future generations depends on our vision.''
   The letter was signed Reps. Mike Andrews, D-Texas; Robert A.
Roe, D-N.J.; Robert S. Walker, R-Pa.; Bill Nelson, D-Fla.; Ronnie
G. Flippo, D-Ala.; Jack Brooks, D-Texas; Jerry Lewis, R-Calif.; F.
James Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., and Mary Roe Oakar, D-Ohio.
   ``This year is a crucial year in the development of the station
and a year when the funding must increase to keep the project on
track,'' the letter said. ``A cut of this magnitude may not `kill'
the space station, but it will so handicap its development that
cancellation becomes a real option.''
   In a related letter to Panetta, Dale D. Myers, acting
administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration,
said that if the space budget cut proposed by the Senate resolution
becomes law, ``we would have no choice but to restructure the
entire civil space program and, without doubt, the space station
would be a major victim.''
   Myers added: ``Discontinuation of the space station would be a
national tragedy. We would be cutting more than the space program;
we would be discarding our nation's aspirations for, and investment
in, the future.''
   The space station would be a permanently orbiting laboratory
that would permit astronauts and scientists to spend months in
space. The station also would have facilities for industrial
research. It is to be built with the joint cooperation and funding
of Japan, the European Space Agency and Canada.
   Deborah Matthews, an aide to Andrews, said the space station
received about $900 million under the fiscal 1989 budget that ends
Sept. 30, and that NASA has asked for about $1.5 billion for fiscal
1990.
   The House Budget Committee is to consider appropriations for
general science and space on Thursday.

<HEAD>Private, USDA Forecasters Disagree on Crop Conditions</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's an awkward time for crop and weather
forecasters who remember last year's drought and searing heat.
   Some say it's too early to tell what to expect. Others say it's
later than you think.
   Analysts in the Agriculture Department say the U.S. wheat crop
could be significantly larger than last year's drought-reduced
harvest. And they point out that most of this year's corn hasn't
even been planted yet.
   On the other hand, private economist John Schnittker said
Tuesday that poor moisture reserves in much of the nation's
midsection have already taken a bite out of this year's crop
yields. And it could worsen if the rains aren't abundant this
spring.
   Schnittker, head of Schnittker Associates, a Washington-based
agricultural consulting firm, said that the 1988 drought ``remains
the leading force in world agriculture,'' at least until more is
known about this year's crops of wheat and corn.
   Both Schnittker and the USDA project huge declines in world and
U.S. inventories as a result of last year's drought-shriveled
yields in North America.
   By July 1, he said, the global grain inventory going into the
new 1989-90 season will be down to a 61-day supply, compared with
an 87-day reserve last summer. That will be the smallest reserve
since the early 1970s, when global grain stocks were drawn down to
a 57-day supply.
   Speaking to a meeting of the National Association of
Agricultural Journalists, Schnittker said the supply situation puts
the United States ``sort of on the razor's edge'' because of the
uncertainties about 1989 crop conditions.
   Although many areas are dramatically improved from last summer's
drought, parts of the Great Plains and Corn Belt are still woefully
dry. Even in some areas that have moderate surface moisture, the
reserves deep in the subsoil are scant.
   ``And if we do have a second adverse crop-growing season, the
effect will be substantially larger in the commodities markets and
in the consumer food retail markets than they have been the past
year,'' Schnittker said.
   The reduced 1988 harvests forced up market prices for the major
crops as it became apparent that the U.S. granary would be
partially emptied.
   Schnittker said he finds himself ``disagreeing quite a lot''
with USDA's chief meteorologist, Norton Strommen, who told the farm
writers earlier that he was still optimistic about crop conditions
improving and that nationally the United States can have a
productive year.
   Strommen and others maintain that the fate of the U.S. winter
wheat crop will not be known for another month or so and that
farmers still have not planted spring wheat or made much of a dent
in planting corn.
   ``If I seem a little on the optimistic side, it may be that I'm
looking at changes that have occurred and the improvements that
have taken place since the fall of 1988 and the real harshness of
the 1988 drought,'' Strommen said.
   Acknowledging that there are ``pockets'' of drought problems
still around _ Kansas, for example, where about 75 percent of the
winter wheat is reported in very poor or poor condition _ Strommen
said many other sections of the country have had good moisture last
year in recent months.
   ``When you put all of the big parts together, the overall
outlook for the country is much improved over what it was last
year,'' Strommen said. ``But we are still deeply concerned about
the pockets and the problems we have in the western Great Plains
and the central part of the Corn Belt.''
   Schnittker said that Strommen ``may turn out to be right, but it
seems to me, with the extreme ... subsoil drought concentrated on
the central Corn Belt at the moment, that it is prudent for private
forecasters, at least, to reduce the probable corn yield a little
bit.''
   Already, he said, the moisture problems have shaved this year's
average corn yield somewhat. If all had been normal, the yield
trend pointed to an average of about 120 bushels per acre, but
Schnittker says he thinks 115 bushels are more likely.
   That would mean a 1989 corn harvest of about 7.54 billion
bushels, up from 5.1 billion bushels estimated for 1988. The USDA
currently estimates last year's corn harvest at 4.92 billion
bushels but has not projected the 1989 crop.
   Based on April 25 conditions, Schnittker forecast this year's
total U.S. wheat harvest at 2.15 billion bushels, about 300 million
bushels less than the output would be if moisture conditions had
been normal. Last year's wheat harvest was 1.81 billion bushels.

<HEAD>Safety Board Calls California Facility `Understaffed Pigpen'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal safety board is trying to stop the
workload from increasing at a major southern California air traffic
control center that officials say already has the reputation of an
``understaffed pigpen.''
   The National Transporation Safety Board, after a special
investigation into nine operational errors at the Coast Radar
Approach Control facility in Santa Ana, raised questions Tuesday
about the center's ability to keep airplanes from flying into each
other.
   ``You've got an understaffed pigpen here, by the FAA's own
evaluation,'' said board member Jim Burnett. He referred to a
statement by former Federal Aviation Administration chief Donald
Engen, who in 1986 visited the Santa Ana center and dubbed it ``the
pigpen of the FAA.''
   The board said controllers at the center regularly work six-day
weeks directing half a million flights a year between Los Angeles
and San Diego. Board staff members said there have been reports of
health problems at the center, with employees taking excessive sick
leave and complaining about working conditions.
   Full staff at the facility would be 66, but the FAA has only
been able to find 24 qualified controllers, primarily because of
the high cost of living in the area.
   The board recommended that the FAA seek to hire local military
personnel and others as assistant controllers so regular
controllers at the facility can receive additional training.
   The board, which met for four hours, said it opposed FAA plans
to expand the center and nearly double the workload unless the
staff can also be at least doubled.
   The board also called for a national task force to develop
changes in procedures at the center.
   An investigation began after a British Airways jumbo jet and a
smaller American Airlines jetliner came within 1.9 miles of each
other at the same altitude on Feb. 13 over Westminster, Calif. The
planes were far enough apart to avoid a ``near miss'' incident, but
FAA rules require aircraft in the area to be separated by at least
three miles horizontally and 1,000 feet vertically.
   The board blamed the incident on a controller who was distracted
by other duties at the facility.
   The inquiry was expanded after investigators found there had
been seven other operational errors in the past year. A ninth
occurred April 6. They also recorded several complaints from
officials and employees at the center.
   The board urged that the FAA give a high priority to
consolidation of air traffic control operations now handled by
separate facilities at Santa Ana, Los Angeles, Burbank and Ontario,
Calif. But board members acknowledged it could take five years or
more to build the new center for which a site has not yet been
selected.
   In another safety matter related to air traffic in Southern
California, the board called for a review of pre-arranged or
``silent coordination'' procedure used by controllers in southern
California and some other areas ``to determine if there is any
degradation of safety.'' The procedure, formerly outlawed by the
FAA, allows controllers to send planes from one control area to
another without orally alerting the controller who is to take over
handling of the plane.
   The board inquiry was its first major investigation into an air
traffic control operation since it began recommending upgrading at
Chicago's O`Hare International Airport after operational errors
increased there in 1986.
   The FAA has started a program to give O'Hare controllers extra
pay, and officials have said they expect the center to be up to
full staff by May.
   The pay program was originally intended to apply to several
facilities where the FAA has had difficulty hiring controllers, but
board members said there are moves in Congress to limit the pay
incentive to Chicago.

<HEAD>Heart Drugs Withdrawn for Patients with Mildly Irregular Heartbeats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors should stop using the drugs Tambocor
and Enkaid to treat patients with mildly irregular heartbeats
because studies show an unexpectedly high death rate among users,
federal authorities say.
   The two drugs may continue to be used to treat patients in
emergencies in which the heart has slipped into a life-threatening
rhythm.
   About 200,000 heart patients take the medicines regularly, and
most of these patients suffer only from mild heartbeat
irregularities, officials at the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute said Tuesday.
   The rate of deaths among patients taking the drugs was
discovered only after a mortality study was conducted by the NHLBI.
The study was intended to determine if heart attack patients who
suffered mild heartbeat irregularities lived longer if they took
medicine to modify that irregular beat, or arrhythmia.
   Instead, the study found that death was almost twice as frequent
among those who took the drugs as among those who took the placebo.
   ``I was stunned and shocked when I was presented with the
results of the drug trials,'' said Dr. Thomas Bigger, chairman of
the institute's steering committee for the drug trials.
   A third drug, called moricizine, will continue to be used in the
drug trials. That drug is not now on the market and has no brand
name.
   Frank Young, the Food and Drug Administration director, said
that letters will be sent to doctors to modify the use of Tambocor
and Enkaid and that labeling instructions also will be changed.
Doctors are being advised to discontinue use of the two drugs for
patients with only mild heartbeat irregularities.
   Young said, however, that patients taking the medicines should
not change the use or dosage until instructed to do so by a
physician.
   Tambocor and Enkaid are the only members of a pharmaceutical
class called 1C. Drugs in this group work to slow electrical
conduction in the heart fiber.
   Young said that there are other drugs still on the market for
treatment of mild heartbeat irregularities and that mortality
studies have not been conducted for them.
   Tambocor is manufactured by 3M Riker Laboratories. Its generic
name is flecainide. Enkaid, whose generic name is encainide, is
manufactured by Bristol-Myers.
   Representatives of both the drug companies said they were
working with the FDA to change the instructions on how their drugs
could be used. A Bristol-Myers official said that patients with
unused drugs could be reimbursed but a representative of Riker
Laboratories said no decision had been made by his company on that
issue.
   In the drug study, researchers were to select a total of 4,400
patients, aged up to 80, who had suffered a heart attack, recovered
and then experienced mild arrhythmias. Patients with such heartbeat
irregularities are known to have a two-to-three-times greater
chance of dying from a later heart attack than those without such
heart arrhythmias.
   Half of the patients in the study were prescribed one of the
three drugs, Tambocor, Enkaid or moricizine. The other half of the
patients were to take a placebo, usually a sugar pill.
   The study began in June 1987, and is still enrolling patients.
   On April 17, a board monitoring the safety of the trial noted
that of 730 patients receiving Tambocor and Enkaid for about 10
months, 57 died or suffered cardiac arrest, while of 725 patients
receiving placebos, only 22 died of cardiac arrest.

<HEAD>Shares Rebound Sharply, Dollar Up Slightly In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded
sharply after a setback earlier Wednesday, while the U.S. dollar
edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
438.86 points Tuesday, added another 190.15 points, or 0.57
percent, to finish trading at 33,434.93. The index lost 51.39
points during morning trading, but recovered in the afternoon
session.
   The dollar ended at 131.47 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's
131.17 yen close. It started at 131.38 yen and fluctuated between
131.30 yen and 131.53 yen.
   Stock dealers said the index began to rise when institutional
investors bought issues following the Nikkei's morning plunge to
pick up cheaper issues.
   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.3 billion
shares, up from 800 million on Tuesday.
   The currency rate moved little, mainly due to political
uncertainty stemming from the announcement Tuesday that Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita would resign soon and speculation about
interest rate hikes in Japan, traders said.
   Facing opposition calls for his resignation and public distrust
in his government tainted with a stock-profeteering scandal that
surfaced last summer, Takeshita announced Tuesday that he would
step down as soon as Parliament passes the fiscal 1989 budget.
   Also commenting on a possible move by the central bank to raise
its interest rates, a trader with Bank of Tokyo said; ``It's a
matter of timing.''
   Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita told a meeting of bank
branch chiefs the previous day that the central bank would promptly
take appropriate measures if prices become unstable.

   President Bush said he will nominate
Richard L. Armitage, the assistant secretary of defense for
international security affairs, to be the next secretary of the
Army.
   The 43-year-old Armitage was picked for the Army's top civilian
post by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney in late March after
originally accepting a post at the State Department.
   Assuming Senate confirmation, Armitage will replace John O.
Marsh, who has held the position since the first day of the Reagan
administration and who has made clear his desire to retire once a
successor was picked.
   In his current job, Armitage has played a key role in overseeing
American security assistance programs around the world as well as
counter-terrorism and Vietnam POW-MIA issues.
   Armitage becomes the second service secretary to be announced by
Bush. On April 13, the president said he would nominate Navy
Undersecretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to take over the top job
with that service.
   Pentagon sources, requesting anonymity, have said Cheney wants
Bush to nominate Donald B. Rice of the think tank Rand Corp. to
head the Air Force.

<NOTE>Defense Secretary Predicts Reforms Will Probably Fail</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says he believes
it's likely that Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's reform plans
would fail and he may be forced to change course or hand over power.
   Cheney told Congress on Tuesday that as a result, the United
States and its NATO allies must resist the temptation to respond to
Gorbachev's proposals for reducing arsenals and troop strengths and
stick to the policies it has advocated until now.
   Cheney, testifying before the House Armed Services Committee,
said he had watched Gorbachev and had ``become convinced that he
seeks change inside the Soviet Union, but primarily because the
Soviet system has been a failure.''
   However, ``I think it's going to be extremely difficult for him
to succeed, and I think there is a very real likelihood that he'll
either have to reverse course, or that for one reason or another,
ultimately have to resort to force, perhaps in Eastern Europe,
perhaps in terms of dealing with the ethnic unrest inside the
Soviet Union.
   ``And, of course, there's always the possibility that his
successor may arrive fairly soon and may pursue radically different
policies than he has,'' he said.

<NOTE>Spotted Owl Worthy Of Protection, Agency Decides</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has
reversed course and decided to give the spotted owl protection as a
threatened species.
   Environmentalists hope the decision will save the ancient
forests of the Northwest. The timber industry says the move could
lock up vast areas of the region to logging.
   A federal judge in Seattle had given the agency until Monday to
review its decision of more than a year ago not to list the owl
under the Endangered Species Act.
   ``We will present a finding to the court that listing of the owl
as a threatened species is warranted and begin steps to officially
propose it for listing,'' said Meg Durham, a spokeswoman for the
Fish and Wildlife Service.
   Once the owl is proposed for listing as a threatened species, a
year-long review will begin during which management plans for
protection of the bird could be developed and public comment sought.
   The Fish and Wildlife Service in December 1987 refused to list
the owl and environmental groups filed suit. District Court Judge
Thomas Zilly ruled the initial decision not to list the owl was
``arbitrary and capricious'' and gave the agency until May 1 to
review its decision.

   A light drizzle was falling and a breeze
blew across Prince William Sound when Coast Guard Cmdr. Steve
McCall radioed the grounded Exxon Valdez for a damage report.
   ``Ah, not at the present time, Steve,'' the tanker skipper
replied in a deep, slow voice.
   ``Joe Hazelwood here. A little problem here with the third mate
but we're working our way off the reef. We've, ah, been holed and
we're ascertaining right now, we're trying just to get her off the
reef and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.''
   Two hours later, the magnitude of the spill became clear to
McCall when the tanker reported that 138,000 barrels _ about 5.7
million gallons _ of oil had been spilled into the water, according
to transcripts of radio conversations released Tuesday.
   McCall, who had been roused from bed in the early morning hours
of March 24, told Hazelwood to ``take it slow and easy'' after the
skipper said he was trying to dislodge vessel from the reef.
   ``You know, I'm telling you the obvious, but take it slow and
easy, and we're getting help out as fast as we can,'' McCall said.
   ``We're in pretty good shape right now, stability-wise, and, ah,
trying to extract her off the shoal here,'' Hazelwood answered.
``You can probably see me on you radar, and, ah, once we get under
way, I'll let you know, do another damage control assessment.''
   ``Before you make any drastic attempt to get away, make sure you
don't you know, start doing any ripping,'' said McCall. ``You got a
rising tide, you, another, about an hour and a half worth of tide
in your favor, ah, ah, once you hit that max, I wouldn't recommend
doing much wiggling.''
   Hazelwood responded that ``major damage has kind of been done
and we kind of rock and rolled over it. We're just kind of hung up
on the stern here. We're just, ah, we'll drift over it. Ah, I'll
get back to you.''
   McCall told The Associated Press on Tuesday that Hazelwood
didn't sound inebriated.
   ``I perceived his voice to be that of someone stressed,
concerned about his vessel,'' McCall said.
   Hazelwood is charged with operating the vessel while
intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of
pollution into the water, all misdemeanors.
   Among other developments:
   _The state says 11.2 million gallons actually spilled. Exxon had
estimated it at 10.1 million gallons.
   _Seas up to 15 feet and gale force winds stymied oil skimmers
and today's forecast offered little hope of a break.
   _Hatcheries this week released the first 62 million salmon fry
into the sound since the spill, though their fate is uncertain,
said the Prince William Sound Aquaculture Corporation.
   The release was timed to coincide with the peak of flowering for
plankton that provide food for the tiny fish.
   ``You can't stop Mother Nature,'' said Heather McCarty,
spokeswoman for the non-profit association.
   The pink salmon fry, which made up most of the release, are due
to return as adult fish in the summer of 1990.
   _Two crews traveled six hours from Valdez to Green and Seal
islands where by Thursday they will use propane cannons and
``screamer shells'' to scare away migratory birds stopping over on
the oil-coated beaches.
   The taped conversations between the Coast Guard and the tanker
were released after a Freedom of Information Act request from the
Anchorage Daily News.
   Exxon said Hazelwood was not on the bridge when the ship ran
aground but had turned over the tanker to his third mate, who
wasn't licensed to steer the ship through the sound.
   Hazelwood's attorney, Dick Madson, says his client will return
to Alaska voluntarily, perhaps as early as next week and definitely
before a May 5 extradition hearing in New York.
   McCall stopped short of endorsing Hazelwood's attempt to refloat
the tanker but said he ``probably used all his mariner's skills''
after the ship ran aground.
   Not knowing whether he was stuck, rocking the boat gently was an
appropriate decision by Hazelwood that probably didn't worsen the
spill, McCall said.
   ``Once he satisfied himself the vessel was going to stay there,
he shut his engines down,'' McCall said. Had the ship freed itself
from the reef it probably would have sunk, he added.
   Judging whether Hazelwood's decisions were appropriate ``is a
tough shot to call from a warm office,'' McCall said. The ship's
captain is ``always in a better position to determine his fate than
we are.''

   A former fruit picker enjoyed his first
taste of freedom today after 21 years in prison because a judge
said perjury and prosecutorial misconduct got him convicted in the
deaths of his seven children.
   ``I don't feel freedom yet,'' 53-year-old James Richardson said
Tuesday following an eight-hour hearing in the DeSoto County
courthouse where he had been sentenced to death in 1968.
   ``I guess it's going to take a while to get use to it, but I'm
going to keep trying to make that step.''
   Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly, assigned to review the case
by the state Supreme Court, freed the black man who was convicted
by an all-white jury after agreeing with defense attorneys that
prosecutors allowed perjured testimony and withheld evidence.
   ``The enormity of the crime _ seven children poisoned to death _
is matched only by the enormity of the injustice to this man,''
said Kelly.
   Although the state has 10 days to order a retrial, Janet Reno, a
special investigator assigned to the case, said it will be closed.
   Richardson was released in the custody of attorney Ellis Rubin,
who took him to his condominium near Daytona Beach, where a press
conference was scheduled for this afternoon.
   Richardson's first wish was to eat a shrimp dinner, said Rubin.
   After Richardson was freed, his wife, Annie Mae, cried on the
courthouse lawn, threw her arms up and said ``Thank you, thank
you.''
   ``Right now I feel fine,'' Richardson said. ``Within my heart, I
knew that these great men were going to get me out _ they weren't
going to let me stay in there.''
   In addition to Rubin, he was referring to attorney Mark Lane,
whose 1971 book ``Arcadia'' raised questions about the conviction
in the October 1967 poisonings.
   ``A long and crooked path has brought us back to Arcadia,'' Lane
said. ``And after 21 years, it's appropriate that it should end up
again in Arcadia.''
   Rubin and Lane accused former State Attorney Frank Schaub of
railroading Richardson into a death sentence, which was commuted to
life in prison in 1972. They said Schaub manufactured testimony
against Richardson because of shoddy investigation and a failure to
find another suspect. They said Richardson was an easy target
because he was illiterate, poor and black.
   Schaub has filed a defamation of character lawsuit against the
two attorneys. He also accused state officials of conducting ``a
hatchet job'' and called Richardson ``a child-killer.''
   And retired Judge John Justice, who sentenced Richardson, said,
``As far as I am concerned, a mass murderer is going to walk the
streets.''
   But Ms. Reno, the Dade County state attorney appointed by Gov.
Bob Martinez to look into the case, said Richardson did not get a
fair trial.
   She said Schaub and then-Assistant State Attorney John Treadwell
withheld ``six key pieces of exculpatory evidence ... that could
have changed the outcome.''
   Lane charged that Schaub, Treadwell and then-Sheriff Frank Cline
forced jail inmates and others to testify against Richardson and
suppressed evidence favorable to the defendant.
   The defense also presented testimony pointing to babysitter
Bessie Reece as a prime suspect. Ms. Reece, 67, is in an Arcadia
nursing home suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is unable to
communicate with anyone, although two nurses filed affidavits last
year that she confessed to serving the children the pesticide-laced
food.
   The children, ages 2 to 8, died within hours after eating a
lunch of grits, beans, rice and gravy laced with parathion, which
is now banned. Richardson said he and his wife were working in a
citrus grove in the southwest Florida farming community when their
children were poisoned.
   Rubin told the judge that Richardson deserved not only freedom
but compensation from the state.
   The governor responded, ``Mr. Richardson has lost too many years
of his life in prison, but my hope is that this decision will give
him an opportunity to rebuild.''

   Bowing to audience complaints and advertiser
defections, the executive producer of NBC's fleshy ``Nightingales''
said the series will show less skin and more nurses in uniform.
   ``We did some things we're not proud of,'' Aaron Spelling told
reporters Tuesday. ``Mostly, we want to add to the patient-nurse
relationship.''
   The one-hour drama depicts the trials of five
less-than-brilliant and lusty nursing students. Spelling said if
NBC renews the show, it would return without lacy lingerie, bouncy
aerobic workouts and locker-room gossip-disrobing sessions.
   Critics, including irate nurses, said it demeaned the nursing
profession specifically and women generally.
   ``Nightingales'' is one of several television programs
criticized recently by advocacy groups.
   The Fox Broadcasting Corp.'s ``Married...With Children'' and
NBC's ``Saturday Night Live'' have been slammed for their frank
language and candid sexual references, and national advertisers
have backed out of both programs.
   Chrysler Corp. and Sears, Roebuck and Co. have pulled spots from
``Nightingales.''
   ``We're in a no-win situation,'' Spelling said of the assaults
on the show, which premiered in January. ``We've been beaten over
the head with baseball bats.''
   Spelling, whose program ``Charlie's Angels'' brought bikinis and
hot tubs to the world of TV private detectives, said the new
``Nightingales'' would have characters saying lines like, ``All I
want to do is be a good nurse and help.''
   The show's critics included American Nurses Association, the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and
several nursing schools.
   ``They're bimbos,'' Mary Ann Lewis, a president in the
California Nurses Association, said of the ``Nightingales''
characters. ``They're flighty females with few brain cells and
they're not competent. The show doesn't depict the nursing practice
as it is today.''
   Spelling said he will add a nursing adviser to the show's staff
and deal more realistically with the profession. He said, though,
that the nurses will continue to have personal lives. ``I'm not
going to tell you there will never be a love scene in
`Nightingales,''' Spelling said.
   Suzanne Pleshette, one of the show's co-stars, said at the news
conference that the actresses depicting the young nurses have been
uncomfortable with some of the scenes they've been asked to play,
finding them ``repugnant.''
   Pleshette said the show had erred in its fascination with the
nurses' shaving their legs and the ``ridiculous underwear'' some of
the nurses were asked to step into.
   ``We make our mistakes often,'' she said. ``We started from
scratch and we were struggling. A lot of things we saw we didn't
like.''
   Spelling said that in summer reruns, a much-discussed scene
involving a nurse having sex in a linen closet will be excised from
an episode.
   Although ``Nightingales'' has won its Wednesday night time
period in television ratings, its future is not certain. NBC's
decision about renewing it is expected within three weeks.
   Spelling and Pleshette said they were concerned that
advocacy-group complaints might possibly cross the line into
censorship.
   Said Spelling: ``If you bow to every group of censors, there
will be no television.''

<HEAD>Transcript Describes Eight Frantic Minutes In The Air</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The crew of United Flight 811 struggled with
their crippled jetliner for eight minutes before they realized
passengers had been swept to their deaths through a giant hole in
the plane, a transcript shows.
   The transcript from the cockpit recorder was released Tuesday as
the National Transportation Safety Board opened a three-day hearing
into why the forward cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off
shortly after the plane left Honolulu on Feb. 24. Nine passengers
were killed.
   Eight minutes after the trouble began, flight engineer Mark
Thomas returned to the cockpit after inspecting the damage.
   ``The right side is gone ... it's just open. You're just lookin'
outside,'' Thomas told pilot David Cronin and co-pilot Al Slader.
   ``Looks like a bomb,'' he said.
   ``Fuselage?'' Slader asked.
   ``Yes, fuselage, it's just open,'' Thomas said. ``Some people
are probably gone. I don't know.''
   Six seconds of silence followed, then the crew frantically
discussed flying the plane.
   At the hearing, Boeing engineer James Fitzgerald testified that
the 747's 800-pound cargo doors are safe.
   But Pan Am engineer Robert Dann told of a 1987 incident in which
a 747 cargo door partially opened on a flight out of London,
forcing the jetliner to return to the airport.
   More than a dozen times during the past six years Boeing 747s
turned back in flight because of indications that a cargo bay door
was open, federal investigators said.
   There has been speculation the cargo door might have broken free
when the latching mechanism failed. After the United accident, the
Federal Aviation Administration ordered all U.S. airlines to
reinforce the relatively lightweight aluminum latch mechanisms with
steel.
   The plane was bound for Sydney, Australia, with 337 passengers
and a crew of 18, when the accident occurred.
   The transcript showed the crew worried about staying airborne,
boosted each other's spirits during the harrowing 25-minute return
to Honolulu.
   Minutes into the flight, at 2:09 a.m. HST, pilot Cronin asked:
``What the (expletive) was that?''
   ``I don't know,'' replied Slader, of Langley, Va.
   A loud bang is heard. Power to the recording unit then was
interrupted for 21 seconds before an alarm horn is heard.
   ``Goin down,'' Cronin said, followed by ``Emergency descent.''
   ``I think we blew a door ... or something,'' Slader said seconds
later.
   The crew shut down the damaged No. 3 engine and Thomas, of
Albany, Ind., began dumping fuel.
   At 2:13, Cronin, of Incline Village, Nev., said: ``I think we
might have some damage out there.''
   ``We got a control problem here,'' Cronin said seconds later.
   At 2:14, he noted a problem with the No. 4 engine, and the crew
discussed flying the massive plane on just two engines.
   ``Can you maintain 240 (knots)?'' Slader asked.
   ``Yeah, just barely,'' Cronin replied.
   ``Yeah but we're losing altitude,'' Slader said.
   ``I know it,'' Cronin said.
   Then at 2:16, Cronin announced he had no fuel flow to No. 4
engine.
   ``What a (expletive) of a thing to happen on your, ah, second to
last month,'' Slader told Cronin.
   ``No (expletive),'' replied Cronin, who was on his
second-to-last flight. Cronin retired 10 days later, upon reaching
the mandatory retirement age of 60.
   Immediately after, Slader noted a fire on the No. 4 engine.
   ``Go through the procedure, shut down the engine,'' Cronin said.
   ``We're not gonna be able to hold this altitude on two
(engines),'' Slader said.
   Thomas warned against flying too fast because of the gaping
hole, and Slader wondered what the minimum airspeed was under the
circumstances.
   At 2:24, Cronin announced he couldn't hold altitude.
   ``OK don't, OK, ah well, we have 24 miles to go and we're
drifting down slowly,'' Slader replied.
   ``You're gonna make it,'' Thomas said.
   ``Make sure we don't hit any (expletive) hills on the way,''
Slader added.
   Shortly after, Slader reported seeing the lights of the airport.
   ``OK ... we're 21 miles out and we're in good shape,'' Slader
said.

<HEAD>U.S. Senator Confirms Investigation By Ethics Committee</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger says his
investigation by the Senate Ethics Committee concerning a lucrative
book contract is leftover from his re-election bid and will come to
nothing.
   ``The only reason there's an investigation is because in the
middle of my campaign, a bunch of Democratic lawyers decided they
wanted to make an issue out of something that was old news,'' the
Minnesota Republican said. ``And the (Ethics Committee) has to
follow up the investigation.''
   Durenberger confirmed Tuesday that the committee was
investigating a complaint that he ``laundered'' $100,000 in
speaking fees in a deal with Piranha Press for books written under
his name on defense and health issues.
   The deal appeared similar to the one that landed House Speaker
Jim Wright in political hot water, but the Senate investigation has
no connection with the House's queries into allegations against the
Texas Democrat.
   ``Mine was a legal arrangement,'' Durenberger said. ``This
coincides with Jim Wright, so it gets to be a little more news. I
can't imagine that there will be any consequences at all.''
   A group of Minnesota attorneys, many of whom are Democratic
officeholders or party activists, filed a complaint in September
with the Ethics Committee about the book-publishing deal.
Durenberger had abandoned the arrangement more than a year earlier
in the face of criticism.
   The complaint alleges that Durenberger collected about $100,000
in personal income by circumventing the Senate's self-imposed limit
on speaking fees. It alleges he redefined his audiences with
various interest groups as ``promotional appearances'' for the sale
of his books.
   The money from those appearances went to a publisher and then
back to Durenberger.
   Senators are paid $89,500 a year and they can keep up to 40
percent more in speaking fees, or $35,800. For 1987, Durenberger
reported an income range of $147,456 - $163,550 with honoraria of
$50,050, of which $15,350 was given to charity.
   In the Wright case, the House Ethics Committee has voted to
charge the speaker with using his book publishing contract to evade
the limits on outside income. The committee said Wright encouraged
groups to buy his book, ``Reflections of a Public Man,'' instead of
paying him a normal speaking fee.
   Durenberger or his staff members have said the senator cleared
his book-promotion arrangement with the Federal Election
Commission. The complaint alleges that the senator may have
misrepresented the exact nature of the deal to the commission.
   The complaint was filed during Durenberger's campaign to retain
his seat against a bid by Democratic state Attorney General Hubert
H. Humphrey III. Humphrey campaign manager Joe Tessmer acknowledged
in September that the campaign provided information to help the
lawyers group prepare the complaint.
   Durenberger said members of his staff have been interviewed by
the Ethics Committee, and said he expects to meet with the
committee. An official for the committee would not confirm or deny
any investigation.

   Pennsylvania's North American record lottery jackpot of at least
$100 million dwarfs the previous top 10.
   Spain's El Gordo, or ``the fat one,'' boasts the world's richest
lottery jackpot. A $159 million first prize last December was split
by hundreds of people.
   A $100 million Pennsylvania Super 7 jackpot, if won by one
person tonight, would mean almost $3.85 million a year for 26 years
for the winner.
   Marc Narducci, editor of Lottery Player's Magazine, Moorestown,
N.J., compiled a list of the top 10 previous jackpots in North
America. These are the U.S. state lottery jackpots, followed by the
jackpot figure, the date, and the number of winning tickets:

   Police said they found no witnesses to
verify a report by TV host Morton Downey Jr. that he was attacked
in an airport bathroom by skinheads who painted swastikas on him
and tried to shave his hair.
   As police Tuesday continued an investigation of the incident,
KOFY-TV owner Jim Gabbert said he would cancel local broadcast of
Downey's show if police find the tale was concocted as a publicity
stunt.
   Downey responded to reports that his claim could not be
substantiated, saying he would have to be ``bordering on a little
bit of insanity'' to have made up the attack.
   Downey, 56, was in San Francisco to promote his show when he
said he was attacked in a restroom at San Francisco International
Airport by someone who ``put his arm around my throat and his other
hand across my eyes and dragged me to a stall,'' he said.
   ``They sat me down on the toilet. One guy sat on me, and another
one started cutting my hair,'' said the bombastic program host
known for his arrogant, aggressive style.
   About the time Downey said he was assaulted, a bomb threat
forced KOFY to leave the air during the time slot for the
syndicated series. The show returned to the air after about 30
minutes.
   Downey said that the assault story is true but cannot be
verified because police were not in the bathroom where he was
jumped.
   ``You can listen to all the other stories of people who weren't
there, but that's fine,'' said Downey, in an interview with
WWOR-TV, in Secaucus, N.J., where he returned later Tuesday.
   Police at San Francisco International said they were
investigating the incident reported to them at 11:30 p.m. Monday.
   ``What he's claiming doesn't appear to be the case at all,''
airport spokesman Ron Wilson said. ``We have not yet been able to
confirm any of the statements Mr. Downey made.''
   Authorities found no evidence of skinheads in the area, he added.
   Downey was cleanly dressed when spotted later in a limousine at
the airport and showed no signs of being in a scuffle, said Wilson.
Scissors and a marking pen were found in the restroom, but no
physical signs of a fight were present, he said.
   In an interview with the San Francisco Examiner, Downey
displayed swastikas scrawled across his face, shirt and pants. His
right eye was bloodshot and bruised, his head partially cut.
   Downey said he believed his assailants to be skinheads, young
white supremacists with shaved heads who have been reviled on his
television show. He said his music director, David Lloyd, pulled
him from the stall where the attack reportedly occurred and helped
him out of the building.
   In an interview with KOFY while en route to New Jersey, Downey
said: ``I said to David, `Let's get the hell out of here, I don't
want to make a big deal out of this. I don't want any Geraldo-type
pictures taken.''
   He apparently was referring to published photos of a bloodied
Geraldo Rivera after a scuffle on his TV show.

<HEAD>Voters Decide Cheney's Congressional Successor Today</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters cast ballots today to fill
Wyoming's lone seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, vacated
when Dick Cheney was nominated defense secretary.
   The 40-day campaign often turned negative with the two
frontrunners, Democrat John Vinich and Republican Craig Thomas,
engaging in heated exchanges.
   The special election was watched by both national parties. The
Republicans hoped to salvage some pride after earlier this year
losing special elections in Indiana and Alabama; Democratics hoped
for a sweep with a Vinich victory.
   Officials predict turnout will be about 65 percent of registered
voters, slightly lower than normal.
   Some voters had had enough of the campaign.
   ``It's negative. It's dirty. It's sleazy,'' Cheyenne resident
Lee Foster said of the GOP campaign that called into question
Vinich's integrity and the Democratic portrayal of Thomas as a GOP
pawn.
   Appearing on the ballot as independents were Craig McCune, a
Cheyenne railroad engineer who collected just 1,900 votes when he
ran for the House seat as a Libertarian last November, and Daniel
Johnson, a white separatist who moved from California to Wyoming in
mid-March.
   Neither McCune nor Johnson were expected to gain many votes,
although the Casper Star-Tribune, Wyoming's largest newspaper,
endorsed McCune because of the ``assassination politics'' displayed
by Vinich and Thomas.
   In the last 10 days, polling by the Democrats and Republicans
showed a slight trend toward Thomas.
   Vinich has been campaigning for 19 months, beginning when he
entered a race for U.S. Sen. Malcolm Wallop's seat. He narrowly
lost, and then won the Democratic nomination for Cheney's seat.
   Thomas, 56, is general manager of the Wyoming Rural Electric
Association who was elected in November to his third term in the
Legislature. Vinich, 38, is a restaurant and bar owner who has
spent the last 15 years in the Legislature.
   At one point in the race, the National Republican Congressional
Committee seemed on the verge of torpedoing its own man's campaign.
   Ed Rollins, a high-paid strategist hired to reverse GOP
fortunes, played into Vinich's hands by declaring that he was
calling the shots for Thomas.
   ``Wyoming is something I've had hands on since day one,'' said
Rollins.
   Vinich used the comments to charge that Thomas didn't control
his campaign. But the Democrats had their share of mistakes. The
bulk of Vinich's campaign contributions came from out-of-state
labor groups; Thomas then portrayed the Democrat as beholden to
organized labor with little Wyoming support.
   Vinich also attacked Thomas for being ``soft on crime'' because
of a legislative vote the Republican cast in favor of a
split-sentencing bill. But the bill was opposed by only two
legislators and even former Gov. Ed Herschler, a highly popular
Democrat, disagreed with Vinich's position.

<HEAD>Survey Finds Three Out Of Four American Indian College Students Drop

   Nearly 75 percent of American Indian college
students don't earn degrees because of poor academic preparation,
inadequate financial aid or personal problems, according to a
survey.
   ``The simple truth is most Native Americans and their families
... do not have the financial resources required to pay their
college bills,'' concluded the study, ``The Forgotten Minority:
Native Americans in Higher Education,'' by Robert N. Wells, Jr., a
professor of government at St. Lawrence University in Canton.
   The survey, conducted by mail in August, included responses from
33 two- and four-year institutions with at least 4 percent American
Indian enrollment.
   It found that graduation rates had improved slightly during the
1980s, thanks primarily to better minority counseling and support
systems on some campuses.
   But the study concluded that retention and graduation rates
remain ``disturbingly low.'' It found that 27.3 percent of American
Indian students entering college earned degrees, but more than half
drop out in their freshman year.
   According to federal statistics, 20.1 percent of American Indian
college students from the high school class of 1980 earned either
bachelor's degrees or two-year associate degrees.
   Fifty-five percent of all students in four-year private schools
and 46 percent of four-year public college students eventually earn
bachelor's degrees, according to federal figures.
   Some 91,000 of the 12.5 million students in U.S. colleges are
American Indians or Alaskan natives, according to latest U.S.
Department of Education figures.
   The average cost of attending the schools in the survey was
$5,400, but the average financial aid grant was $1,531 per student.
That leaves at least a $3,000 unmet need for each American Indian
student.
   In an interview, Wells also cited lack of Indian faculty at the
institutions surveyed. There were an average of nine such teachers
at the colleges surveyed. At his own institution, St. Lawrence,
there are three Indians on the staff but none are classroom
teachers, he said.
   On the positive side, nearly half the schools surveyed, 16, had
teacher training programs tailored for American Indians.
   The colleges cited four culprits hindering American Indian
college students: inadequate academic preparation, difficulty
adjusting to the college environment, personal and family problems,
and financial difficulties.
   Some of the personal problems include lack of family support,
homesickness, substance abuse and inadequate transportation, the
survey found.
   Without solid support system on campus, ``the Native American
student will often split before the academic, financial or personal
problem is addressed,'' it said.

<TEXT>
   New federal tax laws and the 1987 stock market
crash put the squeeze on gifts to colleges and universities, with
contributions declining in 1987-88 for the first time in 13 years.
   ``The boomy days appear to be over, on campus as on Wall
Street,'' concluded an annual survey released Tuesday by the
Council for Aid to Education.
   It estimated that gifts to higher education totaled $8.2 billion
in the 1987-88 school year, down 3.5 percent from the $8.5 billion
the previous year.
   It was only the third year-to-year decline since the council
began the survey in 1954-55, said spokesman Paul R. Miller.
   But council officials noted the decline followed two years of
explosive growth in contributions, when alumni giving increased by
25 percent a year.
   ``The increases we have been logging over the past decade,
averaging some 12 percent annually, just could not be sustained
indefinitely,'' said John R. Haire, the council's president.
   Haire said donors apparently decided to make major gifts before
Jan. 1, 1987, anticipating changes in federal tax law that made
charitable contributions less advantageous.
   The October 1987 stock market collapse further depressed the
level of contributions, Haire said.
   The council said it did not expect a quick return to
double-digit annual increases.
   Alumni giving in 1987-88 totaled $2.04 billion, down 13 percent
from the previous year's $2.34 billion. Non-alumni contributions
were $1.93 billion, off 6.7 percent from $2.04 billion.
   Corporate giving totaled $1.85 billion, up 1.9 percent from
$1.82 billion a year ago. Foundation support rose 6.2 percent, from
$1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Religious organizations donated $197
million, 3.4 percent less than the $204 million a year earlier, and
contributions from other sources totaled $574 million, up 4 percent
from $552 million in 1986-87.
   The survey results were based on data gathered from 1,142
colleges and universities accounting for about 85 percent of all
private gifts received by higher education institutions.

<HEAD>College Giving Drops 3.5 Percent Due To '87 Market Crash</HEAD>

   New federal tax laws and the 1987 stock market
crash put the squeeze on gifts to colleges and universities, with
contributions declining in 1987-88 for the first time in 13 years.
   ``The boomy days appear to be over, on campus as on Wall
Street,'' concluded an annual survey released Tuesday by the
Council for Aid to Education.
   It estimated that gifts to higher education totaled $8.2 billion
in the 1987-88 school year, down 3.5 percent from the $8.5 billion
the previous year.
   It was only the third year-to-year decline since the council
began the survey in 1954-55, said spokesman Paul R. Miller.
   But council officials noted the decline followed two years of
explosive growth in contributions, when alumni giving increased by
25 percent a year.
   ``The increases we have been logging over the past decade,
averaging some 12 percent annually, just could not be sustained
indefinitely,'' said John R. Haire, the council's president.
   Haire said donors apparently decided to make major gifts before
Jan. 1, 1987, anticipating changes in federal tax law that made
charitable contributions less advantageous.
   The October 1987 stock market collapse further depressed the
level of contributions, Haire said.
   The council said it did not expect a quick return to
double-digit annual increases.
   Alumni giving in 1987-88 totaled $2.04 billion, down 13 percent
from the previous year's $2.34 billion. Non-alumni contributions
were $1.93 billion, off 6.7 percent from $2.04 billion.
   Corporate giving totaled $1.85 billion, up 1.9 percent from
$1.82 billion a year ago. Foundation support rose 6.2 percent, from
$1.5 billion to $1.6 billion. Religious organizations donated $197
million, 3.4 percent less than the $204 million a year earlier, and
contributions from other sources totaled $574 million, up 4 percent
from $552 million in 1986-87.
   The survey results were based on data gathered from 1,142

<HEAD>Britain Says Iran Expelled Or Refused To Re-admit 18</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Foreign Office said today that Iran has
expelled or refused to re-admit 18 Britons in apparent retaliation
for Britain's expulsion of 18 Iranians in the dispute over Salman
Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses.''
   A Foreign Office spokesman said Britain has formally protested
the Iranian move through the Swedish Embassy in Tehran.
   Sweden began looking after British interests in Iran when Iran
broke diplomatic ties with London on March 7 after Britain refused
to ban Rushdie's novel. Moslem clerics say the book blasphemes
Islam.
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, told
Moslems on Feb. 14 to kill Rushdie for writing the novel.
   Rushdie, an Indian-born British citizen, has been in hiding
since Khomeini's threat, which was backed by the offer of a $5.2
million bounty from two Iranian Moslem clergymen.
   The Foreign Office spokesman, who in accordance with British
practice declined to be named, said Iran's deadline for the Britons
to leave expired Tuesday and some were already back in Britain.
   ``We first heard something was happening on April 19,'' the
spokesman said.
   ``As we understand it, some (of the 18) were people who were in
Britain at the time they were expelled and are simply not being
allowed to return.
   ``They appear to have been a pretty random cross-section of the
Britons who are there. Some of them were long-term residents, some
were businessmen, some were academics _ a whole cross-section.
   ``We have told Iran through the Swedish Embassy that the action
is completely unjustified.''
   He could not say what official reason Iran had given for its
action over the 18 Britons.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government said when it
announced the expulsion of the 18 Iranians that they were perceived
as a security threat. Several of the 18 expelled Iranians were
classified as students in Britain who also worked at the Iranian
Embassy in London.

<HEAD>Two Plead Guilty in Animal Drug Smuggling Scheme</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROGER MUNNS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Guilty pleas by two men accused of
smuggling illegal animal drugs should serve as a warning to farmers
and veterinarians who consider using unapproved chemicals,
government spokesmen said.
   Dr. Robert Clack, a veterinarian from Pittsfield, Ill., and
Heinz Dall, an importer from Ossining, N.Y., each pleaded guilty to
two felonies in a hearing before U.S. District Judge David Hansen
on Tuesday.
   Clack pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and another of
making a false statement. Dall pleaded guilty to a conspiracy
charge and another stemming from the importing of the illegal drug
chloramphenicol.
   Both face up to 10 years in prison. Dall could be fined more
than $500,000 and Clack up to $260,000.
   Seventeen additional charges against Clack and a dozen
additional charges against Dall will be dismissed when the men are
sentenced July 18.
   Clack, Dall and a third man who previously pleaded guilty were
charged in November with conspiring to ship tons of outlawed drugs
from Canada to animal feed manufacturers, veterinarians and
sometimes directly to farmers throughout the Midwest.
   ``These three were among the largest people involved in the
black market trade,'' said prosecutor Henry LaHaie, a Justice
Department lawyer.
   Two of the 16 drugs involved are prohibited for use on any
animal being raised for food in the United States, and three other
drugs are prohibited in hogs or cattle because of their toxicity.
   The government said four others are carcinogens and one,
chloramphenicol, is a powerful antibiotic that has been linked to
aplastic anemia, a leukemialike blood disorder.
   The antibiotics are mixed with feed to prevent the spread of
disease in animals.
   Clack, Dall and Jeffery Engel, president and general manager of
the now defunct Custom Feed Blenders of Fort Dodge, were accused of
masterminding a scheme to truck tons of the untested, improperly
packaged or illegal veterinary drugs into the United States from
Canada, camouflaging the cargo in truckloads of wood chips or
furniture.
   Engel, who earlier pleaded guilty to three counts, will be
sentenced Aug. 25. He faces a maximum of 10 years in jail and a
fine of up to $750,000. As part of their pleas, all three also
agreed to cooperate with the government in future prosecutions
against other illegal importers.
   Farmers and veterinarians who used the drugs will not be
charged, LaHaie said. But he said the case should be a warning to
them to use only approved drugs.
   ``I think most of them are law-abiding and they'll straighten
up,'' he said.
   Richard Teske, deputy director of the Center for Veterinary
Medicine at the Food and Drug Administration in Rockville, Md.,
said the guilty pleas were a mixed blessing.
   ``I think a trial would have provided a good deal of focus and
public attention on this issue, so we'll lose some of that,'' he
said. ``But you never know what a jury is going to do.''
   He said he hopes the pleas would send a signal to farmers and
others who might be tempted to avoid higher prices of FDA approved
drugs
   ``We think it's important for people to understand the dangers
of using drugs that are essentially untried and not subjected to
the quality control process of those approved by the FDA,'' Teske
said.

   Mary Matlosz of Fourth Avenue won $2 in
the New Jersey Lottery but no share of April 15th's $69.9 million
Illinois Lotto jackpot. That was Mary Matlosz of Maple Avenue.
   Nonetheless, people have been calling the wrong Mrs. Matlosz to
offer congratulations and seek donations.
   Mrs. Matlosz of Fourth Avenue said she bought her first lottery
ticket _ a $2 instant winner _ the day Louis and Mary Matlosz of
Maple Avenue won a share of the Illinois lottery.
   ``I went to the store and bought a rub-off ticket. ... All of a
sudden I got a call from a cable television station. I thought, how
did they know I won a rub-off ticket? And this whole ... thing just
bombarded,'' she said Tuesday.
   Mrs. Matlosz said she and her husband, Leo, are not related to
the other Matlosz family. The last name is common in Elizabeth _
``like a Smith,'' she said.
   The hundreds of telephone calls and 20 cards haven't really
bothered her, said the $2 winner. ``I've got a good sense of
humor,'' she said. ``I got calls from nuns. ... I still think they
think I'm lying that I didn't win. They were looking for money for
a home for the aged.''
   Even their daughter left a message on their answering machine
asking if she should quit her job.

<HEAD>Victim Of Bomb at Indianapolis K mart Undergoes Eye Surgery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Doctors removed the lens of the left eye
from the 5-year-old victim of last week's K mart bombing, but they
refused to speculate on whether she would regain at least partial
vision in the eye.
   Erin Bower remained in satisfactory condition after Tuesday's
two-hour operation at Methodist Hospital, where she has been since
the April 17 bombing at a K mart store. Most of her left hand was
blown off and her eye ripped open when she picked up a pump
toothpaste container and detonated a concealed pipe bomb filled
with gunpowder and BB shot.
   The lens had to be removed to avoid inflammation and further
damage, said John Minturn, an eye specialist who operated on Erin.
The lens is located behind the iris and focuses light toward the
back of the eye.
   The blood that was within the left eye is showing signs of
dispersing, Minturn said.
   ``Still, we'll need time and further healing to decide and see
how much vision she'll recover,'' he added.
   The loss of a lens may require her to wear a corrective lens.
   ``If her eye has some potential vision in it, possibly a contact
lens would correct the loss of the normal lens,'' Minturn said at a
hospital news conference.
   Investigators said Tuesday that a woman who telephoned the K
mart to apologize for the bombing likely was not involved.
   ``The kind of statements she made could really be made by
anybody,'' said Detective Earl K. Cooper of the Marion County
Sheriff's Department.
   Of more than 400 calls received by authorities, Monday's call
was the first confessing to the bombing, investigators said.
   Investigators have concentrated their search on two men seen
leaving the store moments after the blast. One of those men, they
believe, might have bought BB shot at the same K mart three days
before the explosion.

<HEAD>Researchers Plan To Proceed With Adrenal Transplants</HEAD>

   Vanderbilt Univeristy researchers plan
to proceed with adrenal tissue transplants to treat Parkinson's
disease, even though only four of its 18 transplant patients showed
distinct improvement.
   The university performed the nation's first adrenal tissue
transplant in April 1987. Hospital officials in December announced
a clinical trial of 240 Parkinson's patients, half of whom would
undergo the surgery, to determine the transplants' benefits.
   Early results are expected to be published next week in the
Archives of Neurology. The publication follows a recent American
Academy of Neurology report urging ``great caution'' before
large-scale human studies of the procedure are launched.
   An estimated 100 adrenal tissue transplants have been performed
in the United States.
   Parkinson's disease, which afflicts an estimated 1.5 million
Americans, is marked by trembling and muscular rigidity, and is
caused by degeneration of the basel ganglia of the brain.
   Vanderbilt neurosurgeon Noel Tulipan agreed doctors should move
slowly.
   ``I think a lot of people started doing this operation without
having the vaguest idea what they were doing. The result is we
still don't know what the real benefits of the operation are and
that's the real reason for us to do the study we're doing,'' he
said.
   The surgery involves removing one of the patient's adrenal
glands _ on the upper part of the kidney _ and grafting the adrenal
medulla, or inner core, from the gland into a specific nucleus of
the brain.
   Based on the four patients who showed improvement, researchers
have been unable to determine which patients are more likely to
benefit from the operation.
   The Parkinson's trial under way at Vanderbilt will help
determine which, if any, patients suffering from the crippling
disorder will benefit from the operation, Tulipan said.
   Vanderbilt researchers led by Dr. George S. Allen, chairman of
neurosurgery, reported improvements that lasted for at least one
year in patients with mild, as well as severe, Parkinson's.
   The 18 patients, ages 35 to 69, were followed up at either six
or 12 months. Tulipan said no patient worsened because of the
operation. One patient died from a heart attack unrelated to the
transplant, he said.
   The reasons for the improvements are unknown, but Tulipan said
researchers concluded that older patients with existing cognitive
impairment should not undergo the operation until further study.
   They also hope patients who did improve during the follow-up
period may still benefit from the transplant.
   None of the four patients' showing improvements was cured,
Tulipan said.
   ``It's not as if their shaking has stopped or any of their other
symptoms have been cured,'' he said. ``It's just that they are
somewhat better.''
   The neurology academy said the positive results from the
transplants have been less dramatic than those originally reported
by Mexican researchers, who first attempted the operation.
   They reported in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1987
that two patients who had undergone the procedure had shown
impressive results.

   Runners and neighbors of the teens charged with
beating and raping a jogger in Central Park prayed for the comatose
victim as doctors studied discouraging results of tests on her
brain.
   Prayer vigils were held Tuesday for the 28-year-old investment
banker, who was ambushed by a gang of youths April 19, and a
Department of Correction spokeswoman said two of the eight suspects
had been attacked in jail by other inmates.
   Michael Brisco, 17, reported back and neck pain, and Kharey
Wise, 16, complained of an injured thigh after a fight Monday night
at the Rikers Island adolescent center, said the spokeswoman, Ruby
Ryles.
   She said the incident began in a room where Brisco and Wise were
watching television with other inmates.
   Both were put into a segregated area.
   Tenants of the a middle-income apartment complex where four of
the eight suspects live held a noon prayer vigil Tuesday outside
Metropolitan Hospital, where the victim is a patient.
   Mayor Edward I. Koch convened another vigil at the hospital at
6:30 p.m. where a rabbi, a Catholic priest and an Episcopal priest
offered prayers for the victim's recovery and for an end to
violence and racial discord.
   A crowd of 300 blacks, whites and Hispanics, many holding hands
and with their heads bowed, stood in silence as the clergy spoke.
   About 100 joggers ran from the hospital to the park near 102nd
Street where the attack had taken place. They were joined by
another 100 joggers. After observing a minute of silence, several
runners spoke about safety.
   Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, head of the surgical intensive care unit at
Metropolitan Hospital, said the victim was breathing well on her
own after being taken off a ventilator Tuesday.
   But he said an electroencephalogram showed a ``disorganized
pattern'' of brain waves, indicating ``no coordination between
different parts of the brain.''
   ``As a prognostic sign, this is not very happy,'' he said.

   Syrian gunners blasted the Christian
enclave's coastline with sporadic artillery and rocket fire today
as the Arab League began talks on ways to halt Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Police said the bombardment aimed to keep closed the only escape
route for about 1 million Christians trapped in the enclave north
of Beirut.
   There were no reports of casualties in the shelling that
targeted a 10-mile coastal stretch between Jounieh and Byblos.
   By police count, at least 272 people have been killed and 991
wounded since the current fighting broke out March 8.
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000 mostly Christian troops
are pitted against an alliance of Syrian forces and Druse warlord
Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militiamen.
   Two Cypriot-flagged ferry boats survived shelling by Syrian and
Druse fighters over the the past five weeks to evacuate more than
13,000 Christians from the port of Jounieh.
   But sailings by the Larnaca Rose and the Baroness M were
suspended Monday by Aoun so that a French navy tanker could unload
6,000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate power plants.
   Power was restored in Beirut Tuesday for two hours a day, ending
a 10-day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the main power plants
in Christian and Moslem areas of the divided capital.
   Shipping officials in Larnaca, Cyprus said it was not known when
ferry service to Jounieh would be resumed.
   An Arab League mediation committee began discussions Tuesday
night in Tunisia on a peace plan for Lebanon that would include
sending a multi-nation observer force of at least 200 Arab officers
to monitor a cease-fire.
   According to Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed
al-Sabah, head of the committee, Lebanon's parliament would then
elect a new president who would form a national unity government
committed to political reform.
   The plan was to be presented today to an emergency foreign
ministers' session of the 22-member Arab League at its Tunis
headquarters.
   Lebanon's parliament failed to elect a successor to President
Amin Gemayel before his 6-year term ended last September. Minutes
before he stepped down, Gemayel named Aoun, a Maronite Catholic
like himself, as head of an interim military cabinet to rule
pending election of a new head of state.
   But Moslems and leftists rejected the appointment and pledged
allegiance to the mostly Moslem cabinet of Acting Prime Minister
Salim Hoss, a Syrian-backed Sunni Moslem who governed under Gemayel.
   The rival Cabinets' struggle for power has split the army and
threatens to formalize Lebanon's de facto partition into sectarian
cantons.
   Aoun has approved sending an Arab observer force ``as a first
step'' toward ending the fighting, but stressed that ``the ultimate
objective ... remains ending the Syrian and Israeli occupation of
Lebanese territory.''
   Israel occupies a strip of territory in south Lebanon as a
buffer against cross-border attacks by Palestinian guerrillas.
Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Moslem areas of northern, eastern
and central Lebanon as well as west Beirut under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
   Shiite Moslem militia leader Nabih Berri, a major Syrian ally,
rejected the proposal for an Arab observer force, saying ``We need
them to help us politically ... We don't need more armies.''
   His statements were seen as a proxy rejection of the Arab League
plan by Syria, which considers Lebanon its own backyard.

<TEXT>
   The espionage case against an FBI agent
whose romance with a Soviet spy led to his imprisonment on two life
terms will be pursued, the prosecutor said after a court reversed
the conviction.
   ``We may re-appeal and we have other means,'' U.S. Attorney
Robert Bonner of Los Angeles said, apparently referring to requests
for appeals court rehearing or Supreme Court review. ``If those
fail, we will retry the case.''
   Bonner, who headed the prosecution in the case, said he would
weigh his options after reading Tuesday's decision by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals overturning Richard Miller's conviction.
   Miller, whose 1986 conviction for spying rested heavily on the
results of his lie detector test, was granted a new trial after the
court said such evidence should not have been allowed. He is the
only FBI agent ever convicted of spying.
   The court said U.S. District Judge David Kenyon wrongly allowed
prosecution witnesses to relate the questions Miller was asked by a
polygraph examiner, the answers he gave, and the examiner's
conclusion that he was probably lying.
   Miller, a 20-year FBI veteran, was charged with furnishing a
classified document to the Soviet Union in return for a promise of
$65,000 in cash and gold. He was sentenced to two life terms plus
50 years in prison.
   His attorney, Joel Levine, said he was pleased by Tuesday's
decision but that the victory comes a little late for Miller.
   ``We would be more pleased if we didn't have to wait almost five
years for a fair trial with a client in custody,'' referring to the
time Miller has spent behind bars since his arrest.
   Another defense lawyer, Stanley Greenberg, said they would seek
to have Miller released on bail pending a new trial. He said Miller
is in the federal prison in Rochester, Minn.
   ``The ruling that Miller did not have a fair trial should come
as no surprise to any fair and impartial observer of the Miller
proceedings,'' Greenberg said. ``The prosecution brought to this
case an end-justifies-the-means mentality that I have never before
witnessed in a court of law.''
   The polygraph evidence bolstered the credibility of Miller's
later admissions of wrongdoing, ``the heart of the prosecution's
case,'' said Judge Dorothy Nelson in the 3-0 decision.
   The court, like most others in the United States, has
consistently refused to allow lie-detector results as evidence of
truthfulness because of doubts about the device's reliability.
   Nelson also said Kenyon had made other errors, including
allowing testimony by a government witness identified as an expert
on Soviet recruiting methods to be used to attack Miller's
character.
   Miller was convicted in June 1986 of passing secrets to the
Soviets through his lover, Svetlana Ogorodnikova, a Soviet
immigrant whom he had met in 1984. She and her husband, Nikolay
Ogorodnikov, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage and
are serving prison terms.
   Miller was charged with furnishing a classified document that
sets forth annual U.S. intelligence needs to his lover for delivery
to the Soviet consulate in San Francisco in August 1984.
   He claimed to be playing along with the Soviets in an
unauthorized attempt to infiltrate their U.S. spy network. His
lawyers portrayed him as a well-meaning FBI misfit who dreamed of
redeeming his career. But prosecutors pictured him as a bitter,
vengeful failure easily recruited as a spy.

   At least 38 people were killed and 37
wounded today in fighting between groups involved in black market
activities along the Cambodian border, a Western aid official said.
   ``There was a big ambush on the trading route close to Ta
Phraya,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``So far we have 38 people dead.''
   He said 37 people were wounded, 10 seriously, in the fighting,
which began about 1 p.m. They were taken to the hospital at the
Khao-I-Dang refugee camp run by the International Committee of the
Red Cross.
   The aid official said the dead included Thais but that most were
Cambodians. He had no other details.
   Ta Phraya district is in the province of Prachinburi in eastern
Thailand and about 50 miles north of the Thai town of Aranyaprathet.
   Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along the
Thai-Cambodian border. The trading involves Thais as well as
Cambodian guerrillas and refugees in guerrilla-run camps along the
frontier.
   Also today, gunners continued attacks on Cambodian refugee camps
in Thailand, hitting the Site 2 camp with heavy shells that
seriously injured four refugees, the Western official said. The
injured were taken to the Khao-I-Dang hospital, he said.
   Site 2, with about 180,000 people, is the largest U.N.-aided
Cambodian refugee camp in Thailand. Its outer perimeter is only a
half-mile from the Cambodian border.
   Site 2 is controlled by guerrillas of the Khmer People's
National Liberation Front. The front is one of three guerrilla
groups fighting Vietnamese forces and troops of the Cambodian
government Vietnam installed after invading 10 years ago.
   It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced evacuation
of all but the most essential Western aid workers. The refugees
were not evacuated.
   In the past, shellings along the border escalated as the two
sides maneuvered in advance of diplomatic events. Cambodian
resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to hold talks in
Indonesia next week with Hun Sen, premier of the pro-Vietnamese
government.
   Aid officials said some shells passed over Site 2 on Saturday,
and two rounds landed in the camp Sunday, sending one man to the
camp hospital. A refugee was wounded in shelling there April 15.

   A judge has thrown out a $16 million defamation
lawsuit filed against ``60 Minutes'' humorist Andy Rooney for
saying a product designed to make rain and snow roll off
windshields doesn't work.
   U.S. District Judge Robert C. Broomfield on Tuesday ruled that
Rooney's comments about Rain-X were his opinion and were thus
legally protected.
   Unelko Corp. of Scottsdale, the maker of the liquid windshield
treatment, had sued Rooney over remarks made during a 1988 ``60
Minutes'' broadcast.
   In his ruling, the judge agreed with a statement Rooney made on
television after the suit was filed. ``This fellow sent me his
product to evaluate, and I did,'' Rooney had said. ``Was I only
expected to comment on it if I loved it?.''
   Rooney also said after the suit was announced that he hoped the
court would take American Express.

   Students said today that government threats to
suppress the largest student movement in Communist China's history
have only increased their resolve to make the country's leaders
embrace democratic reforms.
   Student leaders said a class boycott that began Monday has
spread to 41 universities and colleges around Beijing, involving
more than 70,000 students. At least four more schools joined the
protest today, they said.
   Two protest leaders said students were ready to stage street
demonstrations again as they did when they began their campaign 10
days ago.
   Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping on Tuesday ordered authorities to
crack down on the protest, said a journalist at the People's Daily,
the voice of the ruling Communist Party.
   ``The peasants support us, the workers support us, the army
supports us, so why should we be bothered by students,'' the
journalist quoted the 84-year-old Deng as saying.
   His remarks prompted the People's Daily to publish a harsh
editorial that called the student movement ``a planned conspiracy''
aimed at overthrowing the government. The editorial said further
protests would be forbidden.
   The country's major newspapers and radio stations carried the
editorial, and millions of Communist Party members met to discuss
it and to prepare for the crackdown.
   More than 1,000 party members met in Beijing and ``resolutely
condemned the illegal student activities,'' said the Beijing city
television news.
   The Beijing Daily, meanwhile, published an order from the city
government telling students to disband their ``illegal'' unions.
Most of the unions were formed last week after students in Beijing
voted down the official student organizations, which are set up by
university officials.
   About 10,000 troops from the 38th Army, a special force for
suppressing civic disturbances, have taken up positions in
buildings near university campuses, students and Chinese sources
said.
   Student leaders pledged to defy the government and said they
were ready to go back to the streets to protest if the government
does not heed their demands for negotiations.
   ``If the government does not agree to a dialogue we will march
in the streets,'' said Beijing University student leader Wang Dan
at a meeting attended by 2,000 students at the Political Science
and Law College. ``That is our right. We will take the movement to
the people.''
   Since early last week, tens of thousands of students have been
agitating for fundamental changes in China's political system,
including a free press and publication of the financial records of
China's leaders.
   They have also called for the resignations of Deng and of
Premier Li Peng.
   ``We will only develop into a strong country when we respect
human rights and allow the people more freedom,'' said one student
at Qinghua University. ``We've had an emperor for too long, what we
need is a president.''
   Students at several universities said they were outraged by the
editorial and accused the state-run press of distorting facts.
   ``The editorial is rubbish, it is filled with lies and it
insults the students,'' Wu'er Kaixi, a student leader from Beijing
Normal University, told the crowd at the Political Science and Law
College.
   The editorial accused the students of trying to overthrow the
government and insinuated their movement in Beijing was connected
to violence last week in Xian and Changsha, two provincial capitals.
   Last week, crowds of youths entered the ranks of protesting
students and went on rampages in Changsha and Xian, looting stores,
burning automobiles and buildings and beating policemen.
   The disturbances received prominent play in the Chinese press as
the government sought to associate them with the largely peaceful
protests in Beijing.
   The media has remained largely silent about protests Friday and
Saturday in Beijing when more than 150,000 students and their
supporters spent the night at Tiananmen Square to call for
democracy and commemorate the death of ousted Communist Party
leader Hu Yaobang.
   Hu, a relatively liberal politician, was purged in 1987 for not
cracking down hard enough on pro-democracy protests.
   The peaceful protest was one of the largest in Communist China's
40-year history and to date the clearest rejection by China's youth
of the system.

<TEXT>
   An aide who served Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
for 31 years and handled scandal-tainted donations that helped sink
Takeshita's career committed suicide today.
   Police said Ihei Aoki, 58, who had served Takeshita since 1958,
was found dead at his apartment in Tokyo. He had slashed a wrist
and an ankle with a razor and hanged himself, they said, and he
left notes to his wife and several other people, including the
prime minister.
   Takeshita appeared shocked by the death. He told reporters he
had not seen Aoki's note but thought it was possible the suicide
was linked to the long-running Recruit scandal.
   ``I strongly regret (his action). We walked side by side for
over 30 years,'' said Takeshita, who announced Tuesday he would
resign soon to take responsibility for his and his party's
involvement in the scandal.
   Aoki's name, rather than Takeshita's, appeared on loans and
share dealings with the Recruit Co. that now are under suspicion
both for political ethics and bribery. The company, an information
services conglomerate, is accused of trying to buy influence with
politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
   Prosecutors had questioned Aoki several times. So far, 14 people
face charges in the Recruit scandal but none of them is a
politician or political aide like Aoki.
   Last weekend, news reports said Aoki had accepted a $384,000
loan from the Recruit Co. in 1987, when Takeshita was campaigning
to succeed Yasuhiro Nakasone as prime minister. The money, which
was paid back, was said to have been used in the campaign.
   The revelation of the loan embarrassed Takeshita because he did
not include it in a report to Parliament on April 11, when he said
he had received more than $1 million in legal political donations
from Recruit. The loan forced him to change his account of his
involvement with the controversial company, and two days later
Takeshita announced his decision to resign.
   Takeshita did not blame Aoki in his departure statement, but
news reports Monday said he had not known of the loan at the time
he spoke to Parliament because his aide had not informed him of it
until Saturday.
   In 1976, a driver who had carried bribery cash committed suicide
after the emergence of the Lockheed scandal that led to former
Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka's conviction of bribery.
   Meanwhile, political factions in the governing Liberal
Democratic Party were consulting about a successor to Takeshita,
who said he would not leave office until Parliament passes the 1989
budget, likely some time next month.
   The most frequently mentioned candidate was Masayoshi Ito, 75, a
former foreign minister, who has appeared reluctant to take up the
post at a time of political crisis. He said Tuesday the post should
go to a younger person.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper reported today that Ito was the
choice agreed upon at meetings late Tuesday between Takeshita and
other party leaders.
   The daily Asahi Shimbun said a majority of governing party
members judged Ito as the only appropriate candidate because he is
untainted by the scandal.
   The Recruit Co. is accused of seeking influence and favors by
selling prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to
politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
   Takeshita, through Aoki and a relative, was a recipient of such
shares, which skyrocketed in value after they went on sale to the
public in late 1986.
   Profits from selling the shares reportedly went into political
funds _ not only Takeshita's, but Nakasone's and those of other top
leaders of the Liberal Democrats.
   Aoki received 2,000 of the shares, which yielded a profit of
about $30,000.
   The wide swath of Recruit's donations, loans and share
transactions cut through the political leadership have made it
difficult for the Liberal Democrats to find a replacement for
Takeshita.
   Ito's age and health _ he is a diabetic _ make most observers
consider him an interim choice who would serve for a few months
while the party chooses a longer-term leader. The head of the
Liberal Democrats becomes prime minster because of the party's big
majority in Parliament.

   The papal nuncio in Austria, Archbishop
Michele Cecchini, died today of cancer, the Roman Catholic news
service Kathpress reported. He was 69.
   Cecchini was appointed nuncio in Austria by Pope John Paul II on
Dec. 4, 1984, and assumed the post April 11, 1985. A nuncio
officially represents the pope and is accredited to a foreign
government.
   The archbishop was ill during most of his tenure in Austria, a
Catholic source told The Associated Press.
   The Italian-born Cecchini was ordained in 1944 and entered the
Vatican diplomatic service in 1951. In 1969 he was made titular
archbishop and sent to Madagascar as a nuncio.
   In 1976 he became nuncio in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. He later was
transferred to Vienna.
   Archbishop Hans Hermann Groer of Vienna will officiate at a
requiem Mass for Cecchini at St. Stephen's Cathedral on Saturday,
Kathpress said.

<HEAD>Rioting Between Mauritanians and Senegalese Leaves At Least 26 Dead</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Widespread rioting that began over
a land dispute between Mauritania and Senegal has left at least 26
people dead and 675 injured, hospital sources said today.
   The sources said they only knew about casualties taken to the
main public hospital of Nouakchott, the Mauritanian capital.
   Violence also has occurred in Dakar, Senegal's capital, and in
many other cities and towns in the two neighborhing West African
countries. But there has been no reliable word on the number of
casualties outside Nouakchott.
   On Tuesday, Mauritanian officials began airlifting their
countrymen out of Dakar to avoid further violence.
   The hospital sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
they had no breakdown of how many of the dead and injured were
Senegalese and how many Mauritanian. They said 20 of the injured
were in serious condition.
   Violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border
incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by
Senegalese and Mauritanians to farm areas along the Senegal River,
which forms the border between the two nations.
   The streets of Nouakchott were calm today. On Tuesday, police
rushed through the streets of the sand-blown capital of 500,000
people and broke up crowds who roamed the poor quarters and
occasionally surged onto the city's main streets to attack
Senegalese and sometimes wreck or burn shops.
   An 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew remained in effect in Nouakchott and
Nouadihbou, Mauriania's main port.
   In Dakar, 375 miles to the south, Mauritanian Ambassador Mokhtar
Ould Zamal said 100 Mauritanian men and women had been airlifted
out of the city Tuesday.
   Officials at the Mauritanian Consulate, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said thousands more Mauritanians had taken refuge at the
main mosque in Dakar.
   Anti-Mauritanian violence was not quelled in the Senegalese
capital until 4 a.m. Tuesday after the army was called out and
police fired tear gas.
   Both countries have reinforced their troops along the Senegal
River as tensions mounted over the land dispute.
   Both nations have tried to calm tensions since Mauritanian
soldiers allegedly killed two Senegalese farmers in Senegal's
Diawara border village April 9. At least two people have died in
violence in Senegal since then.
   Sporadic violence against Mauritanian shopkeepers in Dakar and
Senegalese in Nouakchott grew into widespread fighting on Sunday.
   Mauritania straddles Arab north and black West Africa.
Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber
extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river
region. Nearly all of Senegal's 7 million people are black.
   The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a
Senegal River island. Even before the colonial period, the black
Toucouleur people farmed both sides of the Senegal River. After
both countries became independent from France in 1960, Senegalese
Toucouleur continued to farm the Mauritanian side they had
considered their own for generations.
   Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm.
   But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up
new farmland and spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture. All
along the border, Senegalese are being forced off the land.

<TEXT>
   A wary state Board of Education has
endorsed a 10-year plan for Boston University to run the school
system in impoverished Chelsea.
   The board's 7-4 vote Tuesday followed hours of passionate
argument. Chelsea officials and parents hailed BU as the city's
rescuer; teachers and Hispanic groups protested that the plan runs
roughshod over constitutional rights.
   In giving its approval, the board attached strings to make BU
more accountable to the public.
   Chelsea is a down-at-the-heels city of 26,000 north of Boston
with a large proportion of immigrants and the elderly. Teacher
salaries are low, as are test scores, and the high school dropout
rate of 17 percent is among the state's highest.
   The takeover plan, which calls for BU to pump in millions of
dollars in donations and the know-how of its faculty and students,
is subject to approval by the Legislature, but that is considered
virtually certain.
   ``Boston University represents a hope, a dream for us,'' Chelsea
School Committee member Bruce Henderson pleaded during the board
meeting here.
   ``Boston University is our salvation,'' said Parent-Teacher
Association leader Rosemary Carlisle.
   But Juan Vega of the Chelsea Commission on Hispanic Affairs
complained that BU and city officials ignored requests for more
information and a Spanish translation of the plan.
   Others raised fears that BU would do away with bilingual
education in the school system, where about half the 3,300 students
come from homes of Hispanic origin.
   Teachers unions are fighting the plan in court as
unconstitutional.
   In its action Tuesday, the board said the Legislature should
make BU hold open meetings and make records available to the
public. If BU rejects this, the board said, the Legislature should
make the legislation expire in two years.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis said his opinion of the plan ``depends on
the terms and conditions.''

   Spago has ordered paparazzi who
linger like the smell of owner-chef Wolfgang Puck's designer pizza
to keep off the premises and leave the stars alone.
   The trendy eatery, whose regulars include Joan Collins and
Michael Caine and where super-agent Michael Ovitz has been seen
schmoozing with Kevin Costner, has even banned two photographers
for life.
   Puck has hired two plainclothes guards to keep the paparazzi off
the property, ending a nightly Hollywood ritual in which the
photographers creep ever closer from the sidewalk to snap the
patrons.
   Puck said he will also build a back entrance for camera-shy
patrons.
   All this came after a shoving match two months ago between
Puck's staff and photographers Jim Smeal and Ralph Dominguez, who
were trying to get a shot of Goldie Hawn and her boyfriend, Kurt
Russell.
   ``I hope the photographers don't come at all anymore,'' Puck
said. ``If it was up to me they could all go to (rival) Nicky
Blair's.''
   Which just might happen, say the paparazzi. They predict
celebrities will desert Spago's when they find out they won't be
seen at a see-and-be-seen restaurant.
   ``We can live without Spago,'' said photographer Scott Downie.
``But can Spago live without us?''

<HEAD>69-Year-Old Gets Electricity In His Home For The First Time</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WHITE TOP, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The isolated mountain home of Jack Blevins
had electricity this morning for the first time in his 69 years,
three months after volunteers began negotiating to get a power
company to bend its rules.
   ``It's somethin,' ain't it?'' Blevins said after the power came
on Tuesday afternoon.
   Blevins lives in a North Carolina mountain cove 200 yards from
the Virginia line.
   The only nearby utility, Appalachian Power Co. in Virginia, has
a policy against selling electricity across state lines. But it
agreed last month to route the sale through a North Carolina
electric cooperative.
   The volunteers who negotiated the arrangement celebrated with
Blevins by crowding into the cabin they had built for him and
switching on all the lights, the donated television and the donated
refrigerator at the same time.
   Caseworkers with the Blue Ridge Opportunity Commission
discovered Blevins last fall living with his now-deceased
73-year-old brother, Tom, in a wooden house with gaps in the walls
large enough to walk through.
   Since there was no road, the volunteers reached the house by
easing vehicles along an abandoned railroad bed and across a series
of rickety trestles high over Big Horse Creek.
   Workmen from Appalachian Power ambled toward the cabin from the
Virginia state line to see if all was working properly.
   Blevins stuck his head out the door and grinned.
   ``Come on in,'' he said. ``The power got here before you did.''

<HEAD>Senators Give Cheney High Marks for Tough Decisions</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New material, editing throughout with Nunn, Warner quotes today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman and ranking Republican on the
Senate Armed Services Committee today gave Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney high marks for crafting cuts in the Pentagon budget, but
expressed concerns about some of the specific reductions.
   Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., and John Warner, R-Va., commented a day
after Cheney outlined planned reductions, delays and cuts totaling
$10 billion before the House Armed Services Committee. The savings
were required to meet the fiscal 1990 budget level of $295.6
billion for the Defense Department agreed upon by the White House
and Congress.
   ``I think Defense Secretary Cheney and President Bush stepped up
to the plate and made some tough decisions here under very rough
circumstances,'' Nunn said on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   But, he said, he is ``very concerned'' about the decision to
scrap the Marine Corps' V-22 Osprey, a battlefield aircraft
designed to take off like a helicopter but fly like an airplane.
   ``That has very strong implications for future commercial
aviation as well as for the military,'' Nunn said.
   The Pentagon had hoped to spend $25.9 billion on 663 Ospreys,
including $1.3 billion in 1990. Cheney called the decision to drop
it his most difficult.
   Warner, interviewed with Nunn, gave Cheney ``very high marks''
and added, ``I think we're going to follow the Bush-Cheney plan
very closely.''
   However, Warner, a former secretary of the Navy, said he is
concerned about heavy cuts falling on that service.
   ``I'm concerned about our deployments beyond the United States,
where our young men in many instances and now women aboard ship
have to be gone for six and seven months, and the stress that puts
on families,'' he said.
   If the strategic assessment Bush has promised to send Congress
the first week in May ``tells us we can cut back on some of those
deployments abroad and the time, then I think the impact is
somewhat less severe,'' Warner said.
   Navy cuts outlined by Cheney included retiring the Coral Sea,
one of the last two World War II-era aircraft carriers;
transferring to the reserves 10 frigates; retiring seven
destroyers; canceling production of the F-14D fighter, and
scrubbing the purchase of the last Los Angeles-class nuclear attack
submarine.
   Cheney also got a generally approving reaction from the House
Armed Services Committee during his day-long presentation Tuesday.
   ``Now there's much in what you presented that I don't like, some
of which I disagree with, but I'm willing to buy it as a package,''
Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on the
committee, told Cheney.
   Among Cheney's proposals were a reduction for the Army, Navy and
Air Force in active-duty strength of more than 2.1 million by
16,800 men and women. The defense secretary left intact a proposed
3.6 percent pay hike for those in the military.
   Cheney, who has been on the job just 39 days, said the process
``for the ultimate Republican hawk,'' was extremely difficult, but
he knew of no other way to cut the budget.
   Among the big-ticket items facing major changes were:
   _``Star Wars,'' the program pushed by Ronald Reagan to develop
lasers and other exotic weapons to shoot down enemy nuclear
missiles, will lose $1 billion from its proposal 1990 budget,
giving it a new total of $4.6 billion.
   _The B-2 stealth bomber will have its production pushed back a
year to 1993. Almost $4.1 billion is being cut from the fiscal 1990
and 1991 budgets for the radar-evading plane. Recent estimates of
$500 million per plane make it the most expensive in history.
   _The National Aerospace Plane, a joint project with NASA, will
be scaled back drastically. The high-speed transport could fly
around the world in just hours. Cheney decided to cut the project's
fiscal 1990 budget by two-thirds, from $300 million to $100 million.
   _The Midgetman nuclear missile, a single-warhead missile that
would be small enough to be carried and fired from a truck
launcher, will be held to $100 million despite President Bush's
decision to develop the missile in addition to a rail-based version
of the MX nuclear missile.
   Spending for the MX in fiscal 1990 would total $1.2 billion,
with another $2.2 billion earmarked for fiscal 1991.
   Democrats and Republicans expressed their opposition to the
elimination of the V-22 Osprey, arguing that the technology
associated with the program makes it an aircraft whose time has
come.
   Rep. Solomon P. Ortiz, D-Texas, said he ``wouldn't be surprised
if 10 years from now we were buying the technology from someone
else,'' and Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., asked Cheney to provide the
documentation he used in deciding to kill the Osprey.
   ``You're going to hear much more about it,'' Weldon said. ``This
program has strong support in the Congress.''
   But Cheney stood by his decision, reminding House members that
Bush and Congress agreed on the total defense budget and in light
of the program's lack of affordability, he had no other choice.
   ``I urge you to work your wiles and come out with another $27
billion,'' Cheney told the panel after at least five lawmakers had
criticized the decision.
   Earlier, Dickinson had cautioned the defense secretary against
weakening his stand.
   ``If you don't hang tough and if you let them start opening the
package and the whole thing comes unglued, we're going to continue
to have the fights in the Congress with the admininstration across
the whole myriad of weapons systems and we really haven't
accomplished much,'' he said.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has dropped a quarter of the
most senior members of the Communist Party's top policy-making body
and installed his own men and women.
   At a Central Committee meeting Tuesday, the Soviet president
remolded the body's membership in a maneuver expected to make it
easier for him to wage his campaign for reform.
   Seventy-four of the committee's 301 full members retired,
including former President Andrei A. Gromyko and many other
holdovers from pre-Gorbachev days, and 24 people were promoted to
full membership.
   The committee also retired 24 of its non-voting members and 12
members of the Central Auditing Commission, which handles party
finances.
   Party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told a news conference
that all had volunteered to step down.
   The military lost a substantial voice in the Central Committee:
at least nine senior officers were dropped and just one officer was
promoted from candidate status to full membership.
   The changes left the Central Committee with 251 full members,
party personnel chief Georgy P. Razumovsky told the news conference.
   Medvedev told reporters the number of committee members might go
up or down later. The next opportunity to add voting members would
be at the party congress in 1991, but non-voting members could be
added at any Central Committee meeting.
   While the Politburo is the party and Soviet society's ruling
body, it is the Central Committee in its several meetings a year
that sets policy goals.
   The committee also is empowered to make changes in the
Politburo, and a stronger hand in its affairs could make it easier
for Gorbachev to bring supporters into the ruling body.
   The retiring officials issued a joint request that referred to
Gorbachev's campaign for perestroika, or restructuring: ``It is
essential for us, in the interest of the common cause, to give up
(our) powers.''
   Medvedev remarked, ``This is a serious and important milestone
in our course, perestroika, which shows that our party is
realistically assessing its own work and is quite critical about
its own activities.''
   The resignations followed the first contested, nationwide
elections in 70 years of Communist rule on March 26. Dozens of top
party and government officials, including more than 30 regional
party chairmen, were defeated.
   Medvedev said 83 members of the Central Committee had lost the
government and party jobs that entitled them to committee
membership. Officially, they lost their jobs because of poor health
or age, but some clearly fell from political favor.
   Medvedev said a few of the 83 were too ill to sign their
resignations.
   Western observers call such inactive officials ``dead souls''
and say they can be a conservative force slowing reforms. The term
was borrowed from Nikolai Gogol's 1842 novel ``Dead Souls.''
   Gorbachev has complained that opposition to his social and
economic reform program extends all the way to the Central
Committee, which has included many officials who were seated long
before he became party leader in March 1985.
   In a speech to the Central Committee, the 58-year-old Kremlin
chief praised the retirees for working hard for perestroika.
   ``Many of us had to give up our habits and stereotypes of
thinking. And still, at this time of utmost importance for the
development of our society, the Central Committee rose to the
occasion,'' Gorbachev said.
   But in remarks carried by the official Tass news agency, he
added, ``The situation has changed considerably, comrades. Vast
changes have taken place over this period also in state bodies, and
this required personnel changes.''
   Tass said the retirees included Gromyko, who retired as
president last fall; former Politburo members Geidar A. Aliev and
Mikhail S. Solomentsev and former non-voting Politburo member
Vladimir I. Dolgikh.
   Also dropped were Sergei Sokolov, who was retired as defense
minister in 1987 after West German teen-ager Mathias Rust flew a
plane onto Red Square, and Karen Demirchyan and Kyamran Bagirov,
who lost their jobs as first secretary of the Armenian and
Azerbaijani parties respectively in ethnic unrest last May.
   Among those promoted were Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of
the Soviet Academy of Sciences and thought to be a close Gorbachev
supporter, and the ambassador to West Germany, Yuli A. Kvitsinsky,
an arms control expert who negotiated on space weapons with U.S.
officials in Geneva.

   Seeking new cancer treatments and patients willing
to try them, American researchers are turning to the Soviet Union.
   Scientists from the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.,
and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston said Tuesday they
are starting the first joint study of experimental cancer therapies
with Soviet hospitals.
   The study will involve tests of new therapies on several hundred
Soviet and American patients over the next two years, said Dr. Emil
Frei III, director of the Dana-Farber institute.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy said the study marks a resumption of
collaboration in cancer research that began in 1972 but ended when
the Soviet army entered Afghanistan in 1979.
   ``It is one more sign that the Cold War is finally behind us,''
said the Massachusetts Democrat, whose son Edward Jr. was treated
for bone cancer at Dana-Farber.
   American researchers have had difficulty enrolling large numbers
of patients in clinical trials, which sometimes involve placebos
and side effects.
   Dr. Vincent T. DeVita Jr., a former head of the National Cancer
Institute, said last year that doctors' reluctance to put patients
in drug comparison studies was a ``national disgrace'' that slowed
the search for better treatments.
   Frei said the goal of the collaboration is to share expertise.
   ``We're not using them (the Soviets) in any sense,'' he said.
``They will be the primary beneficiaries of both the technology and
the treatments.''
   Hallie Baron, a spokeswoman for the Dana-Farber institute, said
the project was initiated by the Soviets, who are eager to receive
new technology and drugs from American companies.
   ``What the Soviet side is providing, the advantage of the Soviet
health care system, is that it is very centralized, which allows
them to get just the right patients from all over the country and
bring them to Moscow for these studies,'' said Chris Aho, another
spokeswoman for the institute.
   Kennedy said the study may involve exchanging some patients
between the countries.
   Besides the National Cancer Institute and the Dana-Farber
Institute, the American hospitals participating in the study are
the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center in Los Angeles and Roswell
Park Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y.

   The countdown for Friday's launch of
Atlantis with the Magellan Venus probe progressed in ``squeaky
clean'' fashion today, and some work was ahead of schedule, a NASA
test director reported.
   ``We have no significant open items and we're on schedule,''
Albert Sofge said.
   The countdown, which started Tuesday, continued toward a liftoff
at 2:24 p.m. Friday. Today's major task was the loading of liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant aboard the space shuttle's
power-producing fuel cells.
   Air Force Capt. Thomas Strange, shuttle meteorologist, said the
only weather concern remained the possibility of strong crosswinds
of about 17 mph that could be dangerous if Atlantis had to make an
emergency landing on a runway near the launch pad.
   Otherwise, he said, the forecast was for clear skies and
temperature of 87 degrees.
   Six hours after launch, astronauts Mark Lee and Mary Cleave are
to release the 7,600-pound Magellan probe and a rocket is to propel
it on a 468-day journey to Venus.
   Magellan is to reach its destination in August 1990, swooping
into orbit around Venus to begin a 243-day period during which it
is to map up to 90 percent of the cloud-shrouded planet's surface
with the probe's high resolution radar system.
   After releasing Magellan, the astronauts will conduct
experiments for four days, then return to Earth.
   ``We're not really in charge of the deep space probe,''
Commander David Walker said Tuesday after he and his four crew
members arrived from their training base in Houston.
   ``We're fortunate enough to be part of the team that gets to
send it up there. We're going to give it a little boost along the
way. Then the rest of the NASA team will make sure that it gets to
Venus and does its job. ... We're mighty proud to be part of it.''
   The other crew members are pilot Ron Grabe and mission
specialists Cleave, Lee and Norman Thagard.
   The mission costs $550 million and the radar images could reveal
much about the history of Venus and the evolution of Earth.
   Stephen Saunders, of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif., said it is hoped the computer-enhanced images
will answer ``a major question of why Earth and Venus evolved so
differently even through at the beginning of the solar system they
were almost identical.''

   The 6-year-old son of Tennessee Sen. Albert

weeks after being hit by a car.
   Albert Gore III was wheeled from his room at Johns Hopkins
Children's Center and driven home to Arlington, Va., by his parents.
   He suffered a broken rib, fractures of the thigh bone, a
ruptured spleen, bruised lung and a concussion when he ran into the
path of car after attending the Baltimore Orioles' opening day game
April 3.
   Police said the boy let go of his father's hand and was hit when
he ran out into the street near Memorial Stadium. The driver was
charged with a traffic violation.
   Gore ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential
nomination in 1988. He and his wife, Tipper, also have three
daughters.

<TEXT>
   Students at the University of California
at Berkeley will be required to take ethnic study courses beginning
in 1991.
   Students who packed the upper galleries of an auditorium cheered
Tuesday when the faculty approved 227-194 a resolution requiring
every student take a course on race, culture and ethnicity to earn
a bachelor's degree.
   Such courses must draw from three of five major American
cultural groups: African Americans, American Indians, Asian
Americans, Hispanics and European Americans.
   An important change from the original proposal was the addition
of European Americans, said Valli Israels, student body vice
president of academic affairs.
   ``There were a lot of people, many Jews, for instance, who
didn't like their culture being left out,'' she said.
   Whites make up 48.5 percent of the student body of 22,671
undergraduates. Asians constitute 26.5 percent; Hispanics 11.1
percent, and blacks 7 percent.
   ``California has a lot of cultures. A course like this can do a
lot to bring understanding,'' said Eddie LeRoy, a Latin American
student.
   In 1988 the faculty at Stanford University voted to replace a
Western culture course deemed racist by black students with one
that includes the study of women and minorities.

<TEXT>
   Opposition leaders today urged radical
students and workers to halt their protests and said South Korea
could be plunged into political chaos if they don't. Police clashed
with protesters in two cities.
   The leaders of the three main opposition parties also accused
President Roh Tae-woo's government of fomenting unrest with harsh
crackdowns on opponents and by failing to carry out promised
democratic reforms.
   Kim Dae-jung, Kim Young-sam and Kim Jong-pil, in a statement
aimed at radical students and workers, said: ``We warn against an
expansion of leftist forces trying to overthrow our democratic
system through violent revolution.''
   About 5,000 striking workers clashed with riot police for a
third day in Changwon, about 180 miles south of Seoul.
   Workers hurled firebombs and rocks at police and set fire to
drums of oil to hold back charging troopers.
   In another clash, about 600 radical students shouting ``Down
with Roh Tae-woo!'' hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police at
Hankook University in Seoul. Police used multiple tear gas
launchers to combat the students.
   Police said there were injuries in both cities, but they gave no
details.
   The government issued a warning today against a major rally that
radical workers and students planned Monday to mark the May Day
holiday. The government said police would block the Seoul rally.
   Organizers vowed to defy the warning and said they expected
100,000 people to attend.
   In another development, student leaders announced plans for a
march Friday to the North Korean border for talks with communist
students on reuniting the divided Korean peninsula. Police issued
orders banning the march and a planned rally Sunday in Seoul by
labor groups.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main
dissident alliance, said the police actions were an ``illegal abuse
of power'' and vowed to go ahead with demonstrations.
   The students and dissidents lack popular support because of
their violence and extreme views and are not seen as a serious
threat to the government. But government leaders say a wave of
strikes for better pay are damaging the economy and could lead to
serious political unrest.
   The Trade and Industry Ministry said today that strikes this
year had so far cost about $3.5 billion in lost production,
including nearly $900 million in exports.
   Two of the nation's three automakers, Hyundai and Kia, have
virtually halted production because of strikes at companies making
components, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   The opposition leaders, known as the three Kims, said they would
try to form a new opposition alliance and demanded the government
keep its promise to punish former officials of the authoritarian
regime of former President Chun Doo-hwan.
   Chun went into rural exile last November after apologizing to
the nation for corruption and rights abuses under his rule, but
opposition parties are demanding top Chun lieutenants also be
prosecuted for wrongdoings.
   The three Kims said Roh must keep an election promise to hold a
referendum. Roh called off such a vote in March, saying it would
divide the nation.
   The three opposition leaders have formed alliances in the past,
but they are deeply divided and have often clashed. The last
opposition alliance collapsed earlier this year in a dispute over
whether the government should hold Roh's promised referendum.
   Roh, a former general, won elections in December 1987 after the
three Kims all ran and split the opposition vote. Roh succeeded his
former ally, Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980.

   Elma Milotte, 81, died April 19 at the couple's home near
Tacoma. Her husband, 84, who had been ill and lived in a Gig Harbor
nursing home, died Monday.
   The Milottes worked as a husband-and-wife team for Walt Disney
for 11 years. They spent much of that time in Alaska, Africa and
Australia, collecting footage for prize-winning films including
``The African Lion,'' ``Beaver Valley,'' ``Seal Island,'' ``The
Alaskan Eskimo'' and ``Nature's Half Acre.''
   In Florida, they filmed ``Prowlers of the Everglades.'' After
retiring from the Disney studio, they shot a sequence for Alfred
Hitchcock's ``The Birds.''
   Alfred Milotte studied at the University of Washington, which
was then the Cornish School of Applied Arts in Seattle, and at the
Chicago Art Institute.
   The couple owned a photography studio in Alaska and were
independent filmmakers there before joining Disney.
   They retired from motion pictures in 1959. The couple
collaborated on three animal tales published by Alfred Knopf: ``The
Story of the Platypus,'' ``The Story of a Hippopotamus'' and ``The
Story of An Alaskan Grizzly Bear.''
   They are survived by a niece and two nephews.

   Vice President Dan Quayle heard
Australian grievances today about U.S. farm subsidies and told
Prime Minister ob Hawke that he must accept the ``political
reality,'' officials said.
   Quayle launched into talks with Hawke soon after he and his wife
Marilyn is arrival on the first leg of a four-nation tour of the
Pacific and the Far East.
   Australian and U.S. officials, briefing reporters, described the
private 90-minute meeting as particularly warm and said the
overriding theme of the talks was that Australian-U.S. relations
are in ``excellent shape.''
   Quayle is to spend five days in Australia representing President
Bush at this year's celebration of Australian-American Friendship
Week.
   Defense issues had been expected to overshadow the talks
following New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange's announcement
Tuesday that he is considering formally ending his country's
participation in the ANZUS military alliance.
   Instead, bilateral economic issues dominated, with Hawke
complaining about U.S. farm subsidies that he said hurt Australian
wheat exports.
   ``There were lengthy discussions on trade,'' said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Quayle, according to the officials, explained it was not the
U.S. intention to ``deliberately target Australia'' with its Export
Enhancement Program, which is designed to counter the trade
strategy of the European Economic Community.
   They said Hawke provided the vice president with analytical and
statistical evidence about how Australia was suffering from U.S.
trade policies and that Quayle took note of the concerns.
   While both leaders agreed on the need for free trade, Quayle
told Hawke ``that the U.S. farm bill is a political reality,'' the
sources said.
   Quayle and Hawke agreed that Australian-U.S. relations had
``never been in better shape'' and that Australia remains a
steadfast ally.
   New Zealand's Lange said he viewed the viewed the ANZUS defense
pact as dead because of continuing restrictions in its relations
with the United States, which virtually cut off relations because
of New Zealand's refusal to accept port visits by nuclear-capable
ships.
   But Hawke said it was impossible to view Lange's threat further
because ``at this stage it is only hypothetical,'' one official
reported.
   En route here, Quayle made a two-hour stop in sun-drenched
American Somoa, time enough to convince him he liked it and the
``happy campers'' who live there.
   ``Maybe I'll just stay for a few days,'' Quayle told the
islanders who honored him at a native ceremony and showered him
with gifts. As he spoke, a Samoan beauty queen in a sarong dress
shielded him from the hot sun with an umbrella.
   In exchange for the gracious reception, the vice president
proclaimed Tuesday a public holiday for the roughly 38,000 people
here.
   ``I have the power to declare this a holiday ... you can have
the rest of the day off,'' Quayle told a cheering crowd of about
2,000 gathered under palm trees at Tafuna International Airport.
   Townspeople greeted him with sweet-smelling flower leis and a
brass band.
   Later, Quayle told reporters the holiday had been the idea of
Gov. Peter Colema.
   The relaxation in Pago Pago came in sharp contrast to the
grueling pace Quayle had kept for the previous 32 hours.
   In that time, he delivered a speech in Chicago, met with former
President Ronald Reagan in Los Angeles, attended a security
briefing in Honolulu and played basketball at 3 a.m. at Hickam Air
Force Base there.
   Quayle proclaimed tropical American Samoa ``a delightful change
of pace.''
   ``You all look like happy campers to me,'' said Quayle, the
first vice president to visit the territory since Walter Mondale
came to the outpost 11 years ago. ``Happy campers you are, happy
campers you have been and as far as I'm concerned, happy campers
you will always be.''
   Quayle stressed to the islanders the importance of education as
a way of opening opportunities.
   School children waving miniature American flags lined the narrow
road that brought the Quayles to Nu'uli village, a cluster of
houses with corrugated iron roofs and open sides.
   At a traditional ceremony, the Quayles sat on grass mats under a
thatched-roof lodge belonging to the village chief. The Quayles
were presented with 30 cases of canned wahoo tuna, a decorated mat,
wooden jewelry for Mrs. Quayle, several wooden bowls and a basket
purse.
   The Quayles also were to visit Indonesia, Singapore and
Thailand. After returning to the United States they intended to
tour Alaska's Prince William Sound to monitor cleanup efforts from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill.

   When Brad Schranke of Seattle arrived at the
Supreme Court building to begin his 19-hour wait to witness an
argument on abortion rights, police officers told him he was nine
hours early.
   ``I got here at 3 p.m. yesterday,'' Schranke told a reporter
this morning. ``The police did not start giving out numbers for
courtroom seats until midnight but we arranged our own numbering
system.''
   At midnight, Schranke, a transportation engineering student at
the University of Washington, was given No. 1.
   Today's hour-long argument, scheduled from 10 to 11 a.m. EST,
focuses on abortion regulations in Missouri.
   But state officials and the Bush administration are urging the
court to use the case to reverse or curtail its landmark 1973
ruling that women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   Twenty-four people were arrested in protests outside the court
this morning, a court spokesman said. All were charged with
unlawful entry for crossing police lines, a misdemeanor carrying a
maximum penalty of 60 days in jail and $100 fine.
   Schranke said he opposes the earlier ruling. ``I believe that
God is the creator and man has no right to take a life God has
created,'' he said. ``The baby has to have the choice.''
   Dartmouth College sophomores Clay Fong of Alameda, Calif., and
Jordy Green of South Strafford, Vt., were among the earliest
arrivals.
   Fong described himself as a strong supporter of abortion rights.
``If the constitutional right to abortion were taken away it would
have a devastating impact on the country,'' he said. ``American
individual rights are at a crossroads.''
   Green said he was ``neutral'' on the abortion issue and ``trying
to learn more about it.''
   ``Both sides are very articulate in communicating their views,''
Green said, adding that his 16-hour wait in line had proved an
educational experience.
   Maureen Duffy, a Madison, Wis., lawyer, said she had come to the
court ``just because this is part of history.''
   ``I think that's why a lot of people are here,'' she said. ``To
see the court in action and to witness history in the making.''
   Between 150 and 200 members of the public usually can be seated
in the imposing courtroom on a first-come, first-served basis.
   But because the justices and other court officials had reserved
an usually high number of seats for friends and family members,
only 40 to 50 seats were available for the general public, court
spokeswoman Toni House said.

priest and detained him for about two hours, military and church
officials said today.
   The military, which did not charge the priest, accused him of
visiting a safe house used by communist guerrillas. The guerrillas
have claimed responsibility for killing the American, Col. James
``Nick'' Rowe.
   The priest, the Rev. Benjamin Alforque, denied any links to
Rowe's killers. Church and human rights groups denounced his
detention as part of a campaign to silence religious leaders
critical of military abuses.
   Alforque belongs to several religious organizations critical of
alleged human rights abuses by the military and of the presence of
U.S. military bases in the Philippines.
   Rowe, 51, of McAllen, Texas, was slain Friday on his way to work
at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group. Communist rebels said
they killed him to protest U.S. support for President Corazon
Aquino's counterinsurgency campaign.
   Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief of the Capital Command, said
Alforque was detained Tuesday night after visiting what the general
called a suspected communist safe house near where Rowe was slain.
   When police raided the house today looking for arms, it turned
out to be the office of the human rights group BALAI.
   ``They did not find anything,'' said lawyer Arno Sanidad of the
Free Legal Assistance Group. BALAI is an affiliate of the group.
Sanidad said police detained a volunteer but released him without
charge four hours later.
   Aguirre said the priest, chairman of the Justice and Peace
Committee of the Association of Major Religious Superiors and the
Promotion of Church People's Rights, was released to his superior
after being detained for two hours. Asked if Alforque's detention
was connected to the Rowe investigation, Aguirre replied: ``That is
the principal objective in the operation.''
   Alforque said he visited the offices of BALAI to pick up his
sister, Mariven, who works there. After finding she had left, he
drove toward his seminary-residence when he noticed he was being
followed by several cars of armed men in civilian clothes.
   ``When I saw them, I got scared,'' he said. ``They fired their
guns and it hit my car. When I made a left turn, I hit the wall of
the seminary and got out of the car. It was then that I was
handcuffed.''
   Alforque said the gunmen identified themselves as soldiers and
asked him why he visited his sister's office. He quoted them as
saying the office was used by rebels. Alforque said he was taken to
a police precinct for questioning and was released on orders of
Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.

   More than 80 Palestinian leaders from Jerusalem
and the occupied lands today rejected the prime minister's election
plan and demanded an international conference to resolve the Middle
East conflict.
   ``We believe real peace in the region cannot be achieved by
projects that are calculated to appeal to the media, to end the
(Palestinian) uprising and to win time,'' the leaders said in a
statement. It was the first formal response from local Palestinians
to the peace proposal Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir outlined in
Washington earlier this month.
   Shamir proposed elections be held in the occupied West Bank and
occupied Gaza Strip to select Palestinians who would hold talks
with Israel on an interim solution for the troubled region. After
two years, discussions would begin toward a permanent solution.
   The plan, as outlined by the Shamir government, rules out any
participation by the PLO, which Israel considers a terrorist
organization.
   In their statement, the Palestinian leaders called on Israel to
``recognize the necessity of negotiations with the PLO within the
framework of an international conference.'' It called the Palestine
Liberation Organization ``the sole legitimate representative of the
Palestinian people.''
   The statement said Shamir's election plan was ``an attempt to
divide our people into `inside' and `outside' Palestinians.''
   It said the signers' ``rejection of the election proposal does
not indicate a rejection of elections as a democratic process but
is the rejection of a project which ignores the essense of the
conflict.
   ``This isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how
it will lead to the end of the occupation and to Palestinian
national independence.''
   It urged that the United Nations be given authority to
administer the occupied territories during a transitional period to
Palestinian statehood.
   The statement, distributed in Arabic and English, was signed by
83 prominent Palestinians, many known to favor the PLO.
   Shamir's top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because
of the Passover holiday. Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said
he realizes the Palestinians want a final solution, not an interim
one, but that ``the Israeli thinking is if we start from the end,
we won't have a beginning. This is the idea behind the step-by-step
approach.''
   Chief among them was Faisal Husseini of Arab east Jerusalem, who
recently returned from meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo on
the Shamir plan.
   Husseini is considered the chief spokesman for the PLO in the
occupied lands. He has been held in jail without being charged for
most of the 16-month Palestinian uprising, and also has met with
Israeli officials on their peace plans for the territories.
   During the uprising against Israeli occupation of the
territories, 450 Palestinians and 18 Israelis have been killed.
   Others who signed the document included university professor
Sari Nusseibeh of Jerusalem; Haidar Abd al-Shafi, head of the Red
Crescent Society in Gaza; Gabi Baramki, head of Beir Zeit
University; Mayor Hilme Hanoun of Tulkarem; and Audeh al-Ranteesi,
an Anglican priest from Ramallah.
   The United States has backed the idea of elections in the
occupied lands and has called on Israel and the Palestinians to
work out a way to hold such balloting. President Bush said after
Shamir presented his plan that he believes Israel must end its
occupation of the territories but that he does not favor the
creation of a Palestinian state. Late last year, the United States
reversed a longstanding policy and opened talks with the PLO.
   The Soviet Union has been a major proponent of an international
conference, which also has the backing of major Arab states,
including Egypt and Jordan.
   Today's statement said Israel ``finds itself more
internationally isolated than ever before _ Israel has been
stripped of its main support and has been revealed as a terrorist
state suppressing, with blood and force, a civilian population
struggling with legitimate means for national independence.''
   The Palestinian leaders put forward a four-point plan calling on
Israel to:
   _Recognize the Palestinians as a people with a right to a secure
life and an independent state.
   _Recognize the necessity of negotiations with the PLO within the
framework of an international conference.
   _Allow the United Nations to administer the territories in the
interim.
   _Allow the international conference to ``give suitable
guarantees of security for all states in the region according to
definite principles agreed upon by all the parties.''

   A State Department official disputes evidence
in the Oliver North trial, saying the U.S. government backed away
from a plan approved by President Reagan to give Honduras extra
U.S. aid in return for supporting the Nicaraguan rebels.
   The comments Tuesday by Michael G. Kozak to a House subcommittee
came in response to disclosure of the plan at North's trial. The
jury in the trial returned to the courthouse this morning for its
fifth day of deliberations.
   Reagan initialed a Feb. 19, 1985, memo prepared by North and
introduced at his trial approving a plan to link more than $110
million in extra aid to Honduras' support for the Contra rebels.
   That support consisted primarily of allowing the rebels to
maintain base camps in Honduras. At the time, Congress had banned
military aid to the Contras.
   The month after Reagan approved the plan, then-Vice President
George Bush visited Honduras and told President Roberto Suazo
Cordova that Reagan had directed expedited delivery of U.S.
military items and other aid to the country, according to a 42-page
admission introduced at North's trial. Honduras did receive the
additional assistance and continued to support the Contras.
   But Kozak, acting assistant secretary of state for
inter-American affairs, maintains that the extra aid wasn't
conditioned on Contra support.
   ``The ... plan was disapproved, at the objection of the State
Department, on the grounds that conditionality _ linkage between
U.S. assistance and any assistance to the resistance _ was contrary
to U.S. policy,'' Kozak told the House Appropriations subcommittee
on foreign operations.
   Kozak offered no details on how the plan came to be scrapped. He
wasn't asked by the subcommittee about the fact that Reagan had
approved it.
   Kozak at one point mischaracterized the 42-page admission,
saying that North, whose lawyers prepared the document, ``has
linked a trip of the vice president ... to a secret plan that was
never approved.'' In fact, the admission does not address whether
Bush, during his visit to Honduras, told Suazo the extra aid was
contingent on Contra support.
   Bush has repeatedly refused to discuss the contingent aid plan
or his actions during the Honduran trip, saying it could prejudice
North's trial.
   The court admission was prepared by North's lawyers and the
prosecution, in concert with U.S. intelligence agencies.
   Kozak referred to the admission as ``a fiction'' and said it was
primarily the product of North and his lawyers. Some changes were
made by the independent counsel prosecuting the North case. But
administration officials were permitted only to screen it to excise
classified information, he said. Kozak said he was among the
officials who screened it.
   The plan which Reagan approved included an emissary who would
carry a signed copy of a letter by Reagan urging support for the
Contras, according to the Feb. 19, 1985, memo initialed by the
president. The emissary was then to ``very privately explain our
criteria for the expedited economic support, security assistance
deliveries and enhanced CIA support,'' said the memo from national
security adviser Robert McFarlane.
   The document, marked ``memorandum for the president,'' was
prepared by North and an NSC colleague, Raymond F. Burghardt,
according to a notation at the bottom of the document.
   Reagan put his initials in two locations, including the line
marked ``OK'' for the recommendation saying that ``you authorize us
to proceed as outlined above.''
   ``The whole proposed linkage that was included in (North's) plan
was disapproved, was not made, there was no `discreet emissary,'''
Kozak maintained.
   Another document introduced at North's trial reflects opposition
by Kozak's area of the State Department, then headed by Elliott
Abrams.
   A Feb. 15, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane says that Abrams'
operation ``has clearly indicated that they do not desire to have
an emissary, that there is no need to explain the
`conditionality.'''
   A Feb. 25, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane seems to suggest
that the emissary idea was proceeding. It says that Reagan's letter
to Suazo urging support for the Contras ``will be delivered by Ray
Burghardt,'' North's colleague on the NSC staff.
   ``We seem to be well on the way toward an early release'' of the
additional aid, North's memo continues.
   North is charged with 12 criminal counts including lying to
Congress to cover up the Iran-Contra affair, illegally converting
travelers checks from a Contra leader to his personal use, and
conspiring to defraud the Treasury.

   Thunderstorms from Indiana to North Carolina caused flooding
that closed schools and forced residents from a nursing home today
in West Virginia.
   The storms, which also ripped off roofs and produced hail that
dented trucks, dumped 4 inches in West Virginia. About 200
residents along the Elk River were evacuated, authorities said.
   A bridge was closed at Bergoo, where the river level was a
record 16 feet, about six feet above flood stage, and rising.
Bergoo is 70 miles east of Charleston.
   Schools were closed in four counties. In mountainous Pocahontas
County near the Virginia line, more than 60 people were evacuated
this morning from a nursing home in Marlinton to a hospital after
the Greenbrier River overflowed.
   Some areas of the state were hit Tuesday by half a dozen severe
thunderstorms. A 75 mph wind caused the collapse of a house under
construction in Lewisburg, killing a construction worker and
injuring two.
   In North Carolina, a thunderstorm near Durham toppled trees and
ripped off roofs. Several homes were severely damaged.
   High winds blew part of the roof off a Princeton, N.C., grocery
store and damaged mobile homes. Selma, N.C., police said they had
reports of a tornado that touched down on highways in Selma and
Princeton.
   A late-evening thunderstorm at Richlands, N.C., produced
half-inch hail and high winds.
   A night thunderstorm in Ohio blew the roofs of two houses in
Xenia and damaged at least six other homes. Fewer than 20 people
were treated at Greene Memorial Hospital for minor injuries, a
nursing supervisor said.
   In Hebron, a central Ohio community, Fire Chief Randy Weekly
said hail the size of golf balls dented cars and trucks.
   Elsewhere, a thunderstorm in western Oklahoma produced golf
ball-size hail. Wind gusting to 85 mph in Waynoka blew over an oil
rig.
   Cloudy skies and scattered rainshowers prevailed from the
Pacific Coast to the Dakotas. Clouds and drizzle were over the
upper Great Lakes.
   Jacksonville, N.C., received nearly 2.5 inches of rain in the
six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT, while an inch and a half fell in
Dayton, Ohio. More than an inch was recorded in Portland, Ore.
   Skies were fair early today over Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico,
New England, much of the Mississippi Valley and much of the
Southeast.
   Several temperature records for the date were set Tuesday,
including: Asheville, N.C., 86 degrees; Concordia, Kan., 93; Dodge
City, Kan., 90; Fort Myers, Fla., 93; Kansas City, Mo., 90; Lamoni,
Iowa, 91; Lincoln, Neb., 90; Monroe, La., 90; Nashville, Tenn., 89;
St. Joseph, Mo., 92; and Topeka, Kan., 92.
   In Dodge City, it was the fourth straight day of record highs.
   The high for the nation on Tuesday was 98 degrees at Laredo,
Texas.
   Today's forecast called for showers and thunderstorms scattered
from the northern and central Plains across the upper Mississippi
Valley, much of Indiana, and the upper Ohio Valley to the middle
Atlantic Coast; showers and thunderstorms, mixing with snow in
higher elevations, scattered over northern and central portions of
the Intermountain region and Rockies, and rain over the northern
and central Pacific Coast.
   High temperatures today were to be in the 40s and 50s from
northern and central Intermountain region across the northern
Rockies; in the 50s from North Dakota across northern Minnesota to
northern portions of the Great Lakes, and over much of New England,
and in the 80s and lower 90s across much of the central and
southern Plains, the middle and lower Mississippi Valley, the lower
Ohio and Tennessee valleys, the Gulf Coast states to the south
Atlantic coastal states. Elsewhere, highs were to be mostly in the
60s and 70s.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 25
degrees at Yellowstone Park, Wyo., to 78 degrees at Dallas.

<HEAD>Students Arrested While Protesting Defense Department Research</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMHERST, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student protest that resulted in 52
arrests will not stop military research at the University of
Massachusetts, the chancellor says.
   Police in riot gear Tuesday arrested 29 students camped inside
Memorial Hall on trespassing charges. Twenty-three others were
arrested for lying in front of the police bus to prevent it from
leaving, authorities said.
   Chancellor Joseph D. Duffey issued a statement telling the
students that Pentagon-funded research will continue on the
25,000-student campus.
   ``The policy will not be negotiated with students,'' he said.
``Until faculty and trustees in deliberate process modify these
policies, they remain policies governing faculty research at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst.''
   The occupation of the campus building began with about 35
students on Monday afternoon. By Tuesday evening, about 300
students stood outside, the chanting and looking on as the students
inside the hall were arrested.
   Christobal Bonifaz, an attorney for the arrested students, said
they refused to give their names to police, identifying themselves
as either ``John Doe'' or ``Abbie Hoffman.''
   UMass spokeswoman Jeanne Hopkins said about 40 students left the
building Tuesday morning after administrators told them they would
be arrested after 5 p.m.
   Graduate students were told they could face suspension, and any
teaching assistants arrested probably would lose their jobs, she
said.
   The takeover was the second against military research at the
campus in a week. Seven protesters were arrested April 19.
   All research at the university is non-classified and researchers
must make their work public under university rules.
   About $11.6 million, or 22 percent of all grant money received
at the university, came from the Defense Department in 1988,
according to the school.
   The local American Friends Service Committee contends that
Army-funded anthrax bacterial research is dangerous to the town,
which the school disputes.

<HEAD>Wright Gas Well Probe Snags When Investors Balk</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Top 8 grafs new with Rep. Myers raising possibility of contempt
citations; picks up at pvs 7th graf, The ethics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The senior Republican on the House ethics
committee, angered at being snubbed by key witnesses in the case of
House Speaker Jim Wright, suggested today that the panel might cite
the witnesses for contempt.
   ``There are a lot of options. A contempt citation is one,'' said
Rep. John Myers, R-Ind., who returned to Washington from a
fruitless trip to San Antonio, Texas, with ethics committee
Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif.
   ``We're in good faith trying to do what has to be done,'' Myers
said, relating how he and Dixon had waited Tuesday to interview a
group of five investors in a Texas gas well that yielded little gas
but did produce large profits for Wright's blind trust.
   A half-hour after the group failed to appear, a hotel employee
came to inform the investigators that the witnesses weren't coming.
   ``I don't think that's proper treatment for anyone,'' Myers told
reporters. ``We thought we'd get this behind us. But if they don't
want to cooperate, they can slow us down, and they have.''
   Myers said the ethics committee would meet Thursday to discuss
the status of the case, which has left Wright's position as speaker
in jeopardy. He said failure of the Texas witnesses to appear
raised questions about why they did not want to testify.
   ``Maybe there's something more to that,'' Myers said. ``I think
we have to look at this (with) even more scrutiny. Why didn't they
want to appear?''
   In the capital, Wright's colleagues continued to focus on
charges that he sold bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections of
a Public Man,'' to evade House limits on outside income. The
speaker said he might consider giving the profits to charity if the
ethics panel suggests it.
   The ethics panel issued its findings in the 10-month
investigation last week, formally charging Wright with 69 instances
of violating House rules. The panel said he had improperly received
$145,000 in gifts from a Fort Worth business partner with a direct
interest in legislation, and had used bulk sales of a book he wrote
to evade limits on outside income.
   The panel is considering whether there is ``clear and
convincing'' proof of the 69 alleged violations and, if so, whether
to recommend disciplinary action to the House.
   The committee left open one area of inquiry _ how Wright's blind
trust profited heavily from a one-day investment last May in the
drilling venture at Sabine Lake, near the Texas-Louisiana line.
Wright's investment partnership with developer George Mallick
invested $9,120 cash in the well on May 10, then sold the interest
later that day for a $340,000 profit even though oil and gas flows
at the time had dwindled. The well later was abandoned.
   The committee is studying ``the amount of profit over a few
hours' time,'' Myers said. ``It doesn't look good.''
   But in a letter to the committee, Washington attorney Stanley M.
Brand argued that the panel was ``overreaching'' in commanding the
testimony of five people he represents: San Antonio financier
Morris Jaffe; his son, M.D. (Doug) Jaffe; investors Jeff Prestridge
and Dave Myers; and Marlyn Cherry, Jaffe's bookkeeper.
   The ethics committee said it wanted to determine whether Wright
knew about the well deal, which involved the Jaffes, a West
German-owned firm and the blind trust established for Wright in
1987, said Richard Phelan, the ethics committee's special outside
counsel.
   Wright contends he was ignorant of the deal because it occurred
within his blind trust.
   Brand, in the letter he released, argued that the drilling
venture was outside the scope of the ethics committee's original
resolution of inquiry voted last June 9.
   ``Serious legal questions are raised by the sheer overbreadth of
these subpoenas,'' Brand wrote, adding that his clients were given
just a week to prepare for their testimony.
   The development threw another procedural roadblock in the way of
the case, which already was bogged down in negotiations between
Wright's lawyer, William Oldaker, and committee counsel Phelan over
conditions for Wright to appear before the panel for a personal
defense.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., told reporters many of her
Democratic colleagues have discussed the advisability of Wright
giving back any profits he made from the book deal, which is the
most troubling charge to many of the speaker's colleagues.
   ``We have all said that we thought that restitution made a lot
of sense,'' she said. Wright could say, `OK, I probably stretched
it too far,' and donate the money to charity without admitting
wrongdoing, she said.
   Asked about the suggestion, Wright said, ``If that's what the
committee wants me to do, of course I'd do it.''
   But he defended the book sales, saying, ``I never consciously
considered that ... buying books was payment for my making a
speech.''

   Soldiers shot and killed two teen-agers and an
8-year-old boy and wounded 37 other Palestinians today in the
occupied lands, Arab officials said. Palestinians killed a West
Bank Arab accused of collaborating with Israel.
   It was the sixth fatal attack in a week on an alleged
collaborator and came after PLO-backed leaders of the uprising
declared today ``a day of accounting for the collaborators.''
   In clashes with Israeli troops, 8-year-old Issam Omar Aniss was
shot in the chest when soldiers opened fire in the occupied West
Bank's Tulkarem refugee camp, Arab reports said.
   A 20-year-old man was shot in the right arm in the same
incident, and the army clamped a curfew on the camp and the
neighboring town of Tulkarem, the reports said.
   In the occupied Gaza Strip, 16-year-old Sharif El Khatib was
killed when soldiers shot at stone-throwing youths in the Sabra
neighborhood in Gaza City, Arab reports said. Officials at Ahli
Arab Hospitial said he was shot in the chest.
   Three other youths were reported shot in the head in Sabra,
hospital officials said.
   A 17-year-old girl was reported killed in the Shati camp in Gaza
City. She was identified as Ammal Hussein, and officials at Shifa
Hospital said she died of a gunshot wound to the head.
   An army spokesman confirmed the death of the alleged
collaborator. He said the army was checking the other reported
deaths but was having trouble because in at least two cases,
families immediately took the bodies for burial.
   The deaths brought to 451 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 16-month revolt against Israeli occupation. Eighteen Israelis
have died.
   The army confirmed 10 Palestinians were wounded.
   Arab reports said the 37 people wounded included a 2-year-old
girl who was shot in the head with a plastic bullet during a clash
between soldiers and stone-throwing youths in Gaza City. Four other
Palestinians were shot and wounded in the clash, Arab hospital
officials said.
   The alleged collaborator killed today was identified as Fayek
Erar, 40. Residents of Ras Atiya village said he was gunned down at
his home there because he was accused of helping Israeli
authorities.
   To prevent violence during a general strike today, the army
declared curfews on seven Gaza Strip refugee camps and the Sheik
Radwan neighborhood in Gaza City, ordering more than 200,000
Palestinians to stay in their homes.
   Arab reports said curfews also were imposed on most areas of
Hebron, a West Bank city of 79,000 where clashes have occurred for
the past two days between Palestinians and Jews after Israeli cars
or buses were stoned.
   The strike virtually shut down the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and
the Arab eastern sector of Jerusalem.
   Black smoke could be seen rising over Gaza City as Palestinian
youths blocked roads with burning tires.
   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, dozens of outlawed
Palestinian flags fluttered from electricity lines, and graffiti
painted in Islamic green across walls and shop doors urged stepping
up the uprising.
   The Moslem fundamentalist group Hamas ordered today's strike in
a leaflet calling for a shutdown of the occupied lands on the
anniversary of the capture of Mecca in Saudi Arabia by the Prophet
Mohammed in 630. Mohammed was born in Mecca, but he fled the city
when local leaders resisted his first preaching of Islam. Moslems
throughout the world say their five daily prayers facing Mecca.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the nation.
   April 25
   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on President Bush's first 100 days:
   No, we haven't noticed an increase in the number of times the
Pledge of Allegiance is being recited _ even though the pledge was
one of the biggest issues in last November's presidential election.
   But that, of course, can't be the standard by which we measure
the first 100 days of the Bush administration.
   Neither can we use what Bush has called, ``the vision thing.''
And nobody seems to have an accurate handle of how many thousands
of points of light started shining since the White House changed
occupants.
   But George Bush can be fairly judged on his handling of the
economy, the war on drugs, environmental protection, foreign
policy, government administration, and his pledge to transform
America into a kinder and gentler nation.
   In general, he's been doing a good job, a better job than we
expected. If we were to peg a letter grade to his performance, it
would be a C+. But his progress has come slowly _ slower than a
clock in a classroom on a beautiful morning in May.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on improving the educational system:
   Failure to improve the U.S. educational system could saddle
America's economy with ``enormous long-term costs,'' a
congressional Joint Economic Committee said (April 18).
   The committee said America is falling behind in promoting
literacy and job skills even though it already spends more money
per student than any other country in the world. ...
   Other nations recognized long ago that their economic futures
were closely linked to the education and training of their young
people. ...
   There are many valid reasons to promote education but the Joint
Economic Committee's reasoning provides a perspective we all
understand _ dollars.

   The Item, Sumter, S.C., on the ban on handguns:
   Few public debates are as impassioned as the one revolving
around the possession of firearms. ...
   The debate has long focused on handguns, but recent events have
shifted that focus to imported assault weapons. The use of AK-47s
in a number of horrific crimes lately, for instance, has led to a
temporary ban on imported semi-automatic assault weapons. ...
   It is certainly a simple task for a criminal to obtain an AK-47,
but to stop them from being imported is to deny a law-abiding
citizen the right to acquire one.
   Perhaps. But let it not be forgotten that the assualt weapon is
in fact a weapon. It was specifically designed for, and is almost
always used for, killing people.
   To put it in the hands of sportsman does not endow it with
anything more noble, and to compare it with a sportsman's fowling
piece is absurd.

   The Albuquerque (N.M.) Tribune on Congressional ethics:
   It was fitting that President Bush's plan for tightening ethical
standards in government was made public shortly before Speaker Jim
Wright was accused of 69 violations of House rules.
   It was a reminder that while the Democratic Congress has focused
so much attention of late on allegations of wrongdoing in the
executive branch, the national legislature has a substantial factor
of sleaze.
   In presenting his plan, Bush appropriately made the point that
the public finds it hard to understand why ``certain behavior is
considered criminal when committed by an executive branch
official'' but is ``perfectly legal when committed by someone in
another branch of government.''
   Bush said, ``If Washington is to be a level playing field, then
every player should be treated the same.''
   Well said.

   The Kansas City (Mo.) Times on the rape-attack in Central Park:
   The savage assault on a young investment banker by a gang of
teen-age thugs in New York's Central Park is a reminder of how
slowly mankind becomes civilized. And how thin civilization's
trappings are on seemingly ordinary people.
   Police described the 12 youths who raped and beat the
28-year-old woman as ``schoolboys'' who were part of a larger group
that harassed at least nine people during a two-hour period. ...
   Evil does exist in the heart of mankind. Sometime behavior is
simply rotten.
   The awful nightmare last week in Central Park illustrates both.

   The Hutchinson (Kan.) News on fusion:
   The continuing news about fusion is being pushed on the public
at a furious rate.
   But while we wish them well, we'd like someone to come forward
with a little glossary of terms so the rest of us can keep up with
advancements.
   Such things as heavy water palladium electrodes, and helium-4
make some of us wish we hadn't dozed during science class.
   For whatever it's worth, fusion might be something to get
excited about; but the bottom line is that for most of us, the
result is confusion.
   We can't wait for it to be invented; maybe then someone will
explain to us what it really means.

   The West Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on the USS Iowa explosion:
   In all, 47 sailors died in the horrible explosion aboard the USS
Iowa. Families, friends and all of us who relied on those men to
guard our seas want to know why they died.
   Was it because the Navy insists on maintaining a needlessly
dangerous and outdated weapons system? It is a question that
deserves careful study.
   The Navy already has jumped to the defense of its battleships
and its enormous 16-inch guns. ... This is not the time for that
type of defensive thinking.
   Instead, the Navy should thoroughly examine the reasons for the
explosion inside the World War II-vintage gun turret.
   Then, the Navy must realistically determine whether this is the
best and safest technology available to its fighting men.

   The Daily World, Aberdeen, Wash., on the USS Iowa explosion:
   The explosion that killed 47 men aboard the battleship Iowa was
a tragic reminder of the risk that goes with military service, a
risk often not fully appreciated by the American public. ...
   The accident has revived some of the criticism expressed several
years ago when the government reactivated four old World War II
``battlewagons.'' ...
   After the Iowa explosion (April 19), one critic was prominently
displayed on television complaining about the ship's
``old-fashioned ammunition, old-fashioned technology and
old-fashioned wiring.''
   Despite the criticism, the recommissioned battleships serve many
military purposes. They have been outfitted with the latest
communications and electronic warfare equipment and each has been
equipped with deadly Harpoon and Tomahawk missiles. ...
   To suggest, as some have, that the battleships should now be
re-mothballed is like saying that the frigate fleet should be
scrapped because the USS Stark, while on patrol in the Persian Gulf
in 1987, suffered many casualties when it was hit and nearly sunk
by a missile fired by an Iraqi warplane.

   San Gabriel Valley (Calif.) Tribune on foreign oil reliance:
   The spring surge in gasoline cost has boosted pump prices in
California by up to 30 cents a gallon. ...
   Not surprisingly, the Alaskan oil spill coupled with the
unvarnished greed of major American oil companies were all it took
to send gas prices soaring.
   Yet even before the disaster in Prince William Sound, crude oil
prices had been rising steadily for several months as the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other
foreign producers gained greater control over the world market.
   Today, in fact, the United States is potentially far more
vulnerable to price manipulation by the OPEC cartel than in 1973,
when the first oil shock dealt a body blow to the economies of the
industrialized democracies.
   During the 1970s, this country relied on imported oil for about
one-third of its total consumption. After seven years of declining
domestic production amid sharply rising fuel use, the United States
now depends on foreign sources for half of its petroleum needs.
   During 1988, exploration and drilling by the U.S. oil industry
declined to their lowest levels since record-keeping began in 1940.
...
   If fuel costs continue to mount, higher inflation will
inevitably hasten a recession in this country and probably on a
global scale as well.

   Huron (S.D.) Daily Plainsman on House Speaker James Wright:
   It would appear that House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas is in a
heap of trouble. ...
   In light of the recent charges, we do not believe that Wright
can function effectively in his role as Speaker of the House. It
would be best if he would step down from that position. ...
   Wright represents Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives. It
will be up to those voters as to whether or not he remains in the
House. ...
   The president already has been told by the U.S. Senate that his
first nominee for secretary of defense, John Tower, also of Texas,
was ethically unsuited for the job.
   Unfortunately, Bush and Tower didn't withdraw voluntarily. It
was put to a vote and the president lost.
   It would appear to us that until the investigation is completed,
Wright should step down as Speaker of the House.

   San Antonio Express-News on welfare reform:
   While some in Congress might think the welfare reforms they
enacted last year were sufficient, the Congressional Budget Office,
or CBO, has produced a detailed study of that complcated package
that makes it clear that it was reform in name only.
   The lawmakers who pushed through the Family Support Act of 1988
boasted that it would pay for itself by moving low-income families
off the welfare rolls and into productive employment.
   But the CBO now calculates that the measure will actually end up
increasing the number of families on welfare. The total package
will cost billions above current welfare costs.
   That would be OK if the result were to rescue poor people from
the welfare trap. Instead, Washington's continued resistance to
genuine reform will cause even more dependency.

   By peaceful and dogged persistence, he convinced the communist
government of Poland to recognize the outlawed labor union
Solidarity and to hold free elections. ...
   Will Poland set an example to other communist nations? You bet.
...
   Some governments and citizens _ Hungary's for example _ are
openly enthusiastic and excited about setting out on their own with
more political freedom and human rights for the people and a new
economic engine for the nation. ...
   It's no mystery why the Polish government yielded to Solidarity
and Walesa. It wants to gain economic help from the United States
and other Western nations. ...
   President Bush quickly pledged an economic aid package that may
total $1 billion. ...
   We can follow Walesa's example, and let time take its course. We
can quietly help (Soviet leader Mikhail S.) Gorbachev achieve the
reforms in the Soviet Union and in Eastern Europe that the West has
tried for so long to promote.

   Burlington County Times, Willingboro, N.J., on Bush and the oil
spill:
   President Bush has been keeping track of the Alaska oil spill.
But his observations have been from afar.
   Why should he take a presidential yacht into the filthy oil
slick, or an old Navy minesweeper, for that matter?
   It is better, the president figured, to permit the cleanup of
the Prudhoe oil without the distraction of a visit from the head of
state.
   And a visit is all it would have been; regardless of the
opportunity to get some good newsreel footage for the next
campaign, there is very little a clean shaven chap from Washington
can do when that oily ring threatens to creep above the shoe tops.
   Actually, the oil spill will probably be fuel for Bush's
opponent when the re-election effort starts. Remembering the
mileage Bush got from the filth of Boston Harbor, the Democrats
would be remiss if they didn't make reference ... to the
administration's hands-off handling of the spill situation.

   The Milwaukee Journal on college freshmen and varsity sports:
   Hunter Rawlings, president of the University of Iowa, has
lighted a fire of controversy by saying college freshmen should not
be allowed to participate in varsity sports.
   We agree.
   Rawlings announced his intention to bar freshman athletes from
playing or even practicing varsity sports if a national ban is not
enacted within three years by the National Collegiate Athletic
Association.
   He acknowledged that sports can tie students to a university,
but added that ``it goes too far when it causes a skewing of
priorities.''
   At Iowa, some athletes have taken ``courses'' in water-color
painting, karate, billiards and bowling. Rawlings realizes that the
main business of a university is intellectual, not physical,
training.

   Enterprise-Journal, McComb, Miss., on sports emphasis:
   The emphasis this country and several others puts on athletics
has gotten out of hand. The pressure to succeed, and the dreams of
multimillion dollar professional and endorsement contracts, is
corrupting amateur sports worldwide and having a detrimental effect
on the U.S. education system. ....
   To gain a competitive edge, players and coaches are willing to
bend or break the rules _ using illegal drugs, passing money under
the table, recruiting juvenile delinquents.
   The school also cooperate, giving preferential treatment to
athletes by holding them to lesser academic standards than the rest
of their student.
   Parents have also gotten in the act of trying to skirt the
system by holding back their children in school so they can have an
advantage. ...
   Sports is an after-school activity. Children are in school to
learn how to read and write, not how to throw a pass. ...
   If parents want their children to succeed, they'd be better
advised to focus their attention on books, not baskets.

<HEAD>Criminal Proceedings Launched in Use of Tear Gas in Georgia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A criminal investigation has been launched into
the use of tear gas by troops who broke up a pro-independence
demonstration in Soviet Georgia, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said
today.
   Nineteen people died in the clash April 9 and another person was
shot and killed for violating a curfew imposed to curb further
demonstrations. At least 1,100 people were injured in the melee in
the Georgian capital of Tbilisi.
   Vadim Perfiliev said at a news briefing that the investigation
is being carried out by the chief military prosecutor. ``Due to the
fact that tear gas was used on demonstrators in Tbilisi, a criminal
case has been opened,'' he said.
   Perfiliev denied anyone died as a direct result of tear gas or
any chemical substance used by soldiers to disperse the
demonstrators.
   ``When autopsies were performed, the reasons for death were not
the use of chemical gas or chemical substances,'' he said.
   This contradicted reports by the Georgian minister of health,
Irakli Managarishvili, who said Tuesday that at least two of the
victims died from gas used by troops. Managarishvili also said
several others died from asphyxiation that may have been induced by
the unidentified substance.
   Officials in Moscow have confirmed only that tear gas was used,
but doctors treating injured protesters said the victims were
suffering a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by an
unidentified chemical substance.
   One of the victims, Gilo Oniani, spoke with foreign
correspondents in Tbilisi on Monday during a trip arranged by the
Foreign Ministry.
   Mrs. Oniani, a 34-year-old factory worker who was sprayed in the
face with an aerosol, told reporters was unable to sleep due to
nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in her abdomen.
   Manana Gamsakhurdia, the wife of jailed protest organizer Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, said in a telephone interview today that two men came
to Mrs. Oniani's hospital room late Monday and threatened her for
speaking to reporters.
   Perfiliev said a commission made up of top scientists from
Moscow, Leningrad and other major cities had been formed and would
join in the investigation of the clashes.
   ``There are contradictory versions around the events in
Tbilisi,'' he said, including the question of how many gases were
used.
   ``The experts will be able to make their conclusions, and the
public and representatives of the mass media will be informed of
them as soon as possible,'' Perfiliev said.

   A cargo jet plunged into a slum area
near the coastal city of Barranquilla today, killing all five
people on board and two on the ground, the Civil Aeronautics
Administration said.
   Eleven people on the ground were injured, and five houses were
destroyed, the government agency reported.
   The plane, a twin-engine Caravelle of the Colombian airline
Aerosucre, took off from the Barranquilla airport at 2:42 a.m.,
according to the release.
   One of the engines failed two minutes after takeoff, and as the
plane tried to make it back to the airport the other engine failed,
a spokesman with the control tower in Barranquilla said in a
broadcast interview with the Bogota radio station RCN.
   A man and a child were killed on the ground, the agency said. It
said all those killed on the plane were crew members.
   Barranquilla is about 400 miles north of Bogota.

   Hundreds of truckers and other travelers
got off Interstate 80 looking for Easy Street. Even the winners of
a $46 million prize took a chance on tonight's North American
record $100 million lottery jackpot.
   ``You got to dream,'' said Daniel Moellring, of Clayton, Ill., a
trucker who bought five Super 7 tickets in this central
Pennsylvania town Tuesday.
   Dreams abounded in Pennsylvania as $24.35 million in lottery
sales Tuesday topped the state's single-day record and brought
total sales since Thursday to $67.26 million. Sales of the $1
tickets end about two minutes before the 6:59 p.m. drawing.
   ``The final total will be determined by how high sales go
today,'' lottery executive director Jim Scroggins said this morning
on NBC's ``Today.'' ``It's probably at this point in time safe to
predict that it'll be beyond $100 million.''
   Lines formed as early as 4:30 a.m. today at lottery outlets from
Philadelphia to rural Greencastle at the western end of the state.
   Race car driver Mario Andretti, who lives in Nazareth, Pa.,
bought $100 worth of tickets from money he said came from the
family grocery budget.
   In Philadelphia, police said people slept on curbs at several
locations, waiting for ticket outlets to open at 6 a.m.
   ``I don't believe in this stuff. I'm buying these for my
grandfather. He's hooked,'' said Kathy Bohensky, a clerk for a
federal agency who said it took her three days to find a place in
Harrisburg with a short enough wait.
   Because of the huge crush of sales, lottery official Michael
Keyser said the number of winning tickets, if any, would not be
known until Friday.
   But Kenny Kelly, a trucker hauling commercial carpets, had no
doubts at a truck-stop restaurant on the Allegheny Plateau.
   ``I've got the winning ticket. I've been praying,'' he joked.
   Even Donald Woomer and Linda Despot, a Hollidaysburg couple who
won a $46 million jackpot in 1987, got caught up. Woomer said he
bought 100 tickets for this week's Super 7, but he's not crossing
his fingers he'll win.
   ``Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said
by telephone from his home near Altoona.
   In Super 7, players pick seven numbers between 1 and 80. If all
seven of those numbers are among the 11 selected, the ticket wins
the jackpot. Lottery officials put the chances of having a winning
ticket at 1 in 9.6 million.
   Super 7 reached its staggering nine-figure jackpot because no
one picked the winning numbers for six consecutive weekly drawings.
The jackpot starts at a minimum of $2 million and rolls over to the
next drawing.
   A single winner of the $100 million would receive almost $3.85
million a year for 26 years before taxes, lottery officials said.
   The world's largest lottery jackpot, Spain's El Gordo, or ``the
fat one,'' was recorded in December when hundreds of players split
$159 million. The previous North American record was $69.9 million
in Illinois for the April 15 drawing. That prize was shared by the
owners of four tickets.
   Some out-of-state players drove into Pennsylvania and some even
flew commercial flights into Pittsburgh and Philadelphia for a
chance to win the gigantic jackpot.
   Citizens band radios crackled with lottery gossip, and many
out-of-state truckers wanted to know where to buy tickets,
travelers said.
   ``A lot of people from Pennsylvania were saying they should not
let them across the border to get their tickets,'' said Susan
Thornton, traveling to New York City with her mother.
   ``Some were saying, `the more the merrier,''' added Thornton, a
waitress from Columbus, Ohio, who was making her fourth stop
Tuesday. She said she bought five tickets each time.
   A few enterprising folks from Philadelphia ferried tickets to
New York City. Ed Kirlin and his brother, Joe, and Dan Dougherty
bought 2,500 of the $1 tickets and sold them for $3 apiece on
Manhattan streets Tuesday.
   In south-central Pennsylvania's Adams County, an elderly man
passed out after waiting four hours at the Snyder's Market in
Littlestown to buy a single ticket. Gerri Foster, a clerk at the
store, said the unidentified man was treated by an ambulance crew
called to the scene and left the store on a stretcher, clutching
his ticket.
   ``We gave him his ticket and saw that he got it before the
ambulance arrived,'' she said.

   Police are investigating at least 28 incidents in
which baby food bought at grocery stores contained glass shards,
pieces of razor blades, thumbtacks and caustic soda. Eleven cases
were reported today.
   The government said blackmail attempts had been made. The
tampering, which apparently began this month, has resulted in at
least two minor injuries.
   Scotland Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police
inquiry, but it refused to give details.
   The Daily Mail, a tabloid, reported blackmailers apparently were
trying to extort money from supermarkets and food companies. It
said several major supermarket chains and food manufacturers had
received threats.
   Home Office Minister John Patten told Parliament today that ``in
some cases there have been blackmail demands. It would not be
helpful for police investigations if I were to go into any greater
detail.''
   Deploring what he called a ``vicious attack on defenseless
babies'' by ``twisted minds,'' Patten said Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's administration ``is determined to resist all attempts at
consumer terrorism in this country.''
   The government said 28 cases had been reported since April 7,
including 11 today.
   Manufacturers say their investigations have determined that
products are not being spiked during production and distribution.
   One manufacturer, Heinz Co. Ltd, warned parents to be vigilant
when feeding their children canned and bottled food.
   Heinz said it shared parents' ``sense of outrage that a tamperer
is prepared to target a victim as precious and vulnerable as a
baby.''
   Heinz said stocks were removed from shelves and replaced in all
incidents where tampered products were found. But a supermarket in
the northwest England city of Blackpool removed all Heinz products
after a jar of baby food was found to contain slivers of glass.
   Spiked jars have been found in London, in the central cities of
Bedford and Leicester, and across southern England, news reports
said.
   In three incidents reported Tuesday, pieces of glass were found
in baby food bought in Bradford-on-Avon in southwest England, in
the south coast resort of Fratton, and in Newport on the Isle of
Wight off the south coast.
   In the incident at Bradford-on-Avon, Diana Tyndall said she cut
her lip on a piece of glass as she tasted a jar of fruit desert she
was about to feed to her 6-month-old daughter.
   No one else was reported hurt in Tuesday's incidents. But in
another incident earlier in the month, a 9-month-old girl in Oxford
cut her mouth on a razor blade in a pot of yogurt.
   Other incidents were reported at Rayleigh, east of London; at
the southern port of Southampton, where two incidents were
reported; and at the south coast resort of Worthing.

<DATELINE>MARION, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators today said they believe a
young woman found dead along Interstate 195 is the ninth victim of
a New Bedford-area serial killer.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina ``would be very
surprised if this were not a victim'' of the killer who left the
bodies of eight women along southeastern Massachusetts highways,
said Jim Martin, a spokesman for Pina.
   The woman was under 30 and had been dead 10 to 12 months, he
said. The body, found Monday, will be checked against dental
records of three missing women to identify the victim, Martin said.
   Investigators linked the body to the other killings because of
where it was found, the position of the body, certain evidence
found at the scene and information gleaned from the autopsy
Tuesday, the spokesman said.
   He would not be more specific about the findings.
   The autopsy, which was to continue today, did not immediately
determine the cause of death, he said. Bristol County investigators
have declined to say how seven of the eight other victims died.
They have said one was strangled.
   The eight victims so far identified all had links to New
Bedford's Weld Square area, a district known for drugs and
prostitution. The first of the bodies was found in July.
   The body of the apparent ninth victim was found in Plymouth
County, about six miles from New Bedford.

<TEXT>
   The villagers of Langa on Wednesday
mourned the loss of one of Sweden's last wolves, which had made
friends with villagers' dogs but pillaged reindeer herds.
   The wolf was killed last week, six months after wandering into
the area displaying an unusual lack of fear of humans. A $1,600
reward was offered for the arrest of the killer.
   Police and the Nature Protection Department refused to say how
the animal was killed while the case was being investigated.
Reindeer herdsmen denied responsibility.
   The killing ended a month of squabbling over the wolf's fate and
whether it should be moved to another area.
   The department said it concluded the wolf would try to go back
to its old hunting territory if it was moved, and attempts to scare
it away with rubber bullets failed.
   The 150 villagers in Langa, 240 miles northwest of Stockholm,
said the wolf had caused them no harm. They said it had played with
their dogs, ignored sheep flocks and at times passed within six
yards of humans.
   The wolf's death left only nine known wolves roaming wild in the
valleys and deep forests of Sweden.
   Hunting regulations allow reindeer herders to shoot a wolf only
if it is caught in the act of attacking their herds.

<HEAD>Man Says He Took Bus On Cruise Because He Wanted To Be Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORTHAMPTON, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A homeless man who told police he
wanted to be jailed took a bus for a cruise and dropped it off at
police headquarters. He got his wish.
   According to police, Samuel Gallezzo, 23, initially tried to get
arrested by tossing a newspaper vending machine through a window
Saturday night, but officers only gave him a summons for
misdemeanor vandalism.
   Then, police said, he walked into police headquarters early
Sunday and told Sgt. Richard Rogalski: ``I want to be arrested.''
   Rogalski asked why. ``For stealing a bus,'' Gallezzo said.
   ``What bus?'' Rogalski asked.
   ``The one parked out front,'' Gallezzo replied.
   Rogalski found a $175,000 bus belonging to Western Massachusetts
Bus Lines parked at the curb and accommodated Gallezzo.
   But Gallezzo was only briefly a guest of the city. After he
pleaded innocent to larceny of a motor vehicle Monday, he was
released on his own recognizance.
   ``If all he wanted was a night in jail there are easier ways he
could have done it,'' said police Chief David Labato. ``And if he
was looking for a place to sleep, he could have just stayed in the
bus or gone to one of several shelters.''
   Director William Nagle said he let Gallezzo stay at the
Northampton Honor Court, a facility for alcoholics, when Gallezzo
told him last week that he was living in a tent, but asked him to
leave Saturday.
   ``He started some trouble with one of my boys, so I sent him
packing,'' Nagle said.

<HEAD>Investors Said to be Eager to Buy Shares in Medieval Map</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investors are lining up to become shareholders in
the Mappa Mundi in a plan to keep the 13th-century map at Hereford
Cathedral, organizers said Wednesday.
   A new company called Mappa Mundi PLC is offering the public
7,450 shares at about $1,700 each to raise more than $12 million to
keep the map at Hereford and pay for repairs to cathedral.
   Hereford Cathedral caused a national uproar when it announced
last year it was auctioning off its medieval treasure, possibly to
foreign buyers, to pay for the much-needed repairs.
   It then had hoped to raise $4.3 million selling the 708-year-old
map, which shows Jerusalem at the center of the world and Hereford
at the edge.
   But the Church of England subsequently joined forces with
financiers to launch the unusual privatization.
   The bishop and the dean of Hereford Cathedral said they have
been inundated with more than 100 applications from as far away as
the Indonesian capital of Jakarta and Israel to buy shares in the
map.
   Bishop of Hereford John Eastaugh said he planned to buy a share
for his wife and that many members of the Friends of Hereford
Cathedral also planned to take up the offer.
   Eastaugh said: ``We are asking people to give a particular sum
and to have an actual share in this great treasure which belongs to
the nation.
   ``I feel very excited. I shall feel relieved when we've got the
money in.''
   The offer opens May 3 for a 42-day period and all shareholders
are to receive reproductions of the map, bearing a seal and signed
by the bishop, and the dean, Peter Haynes.
   The idea was dreamed up by marketing specialist Paul Billingham
who was upset when he read about the planned sale in the
newspapers. He approached financiers, who then put the idea to the
bishop and the dean.
   ``I think they had a tough time and it was a difficult decision
for them to make. We had to explain something to them that was
obviously alien, but I'm glad they've gone this route,'' Billingham
said.

<HEAD>EDS: New thruout to UPDATE with eight arrests, injuries; Fans threatening

<DATELINE>ROTTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soccer fans hurled bricks, smashed
store windows and looted a toy store today in unrest that broke out
before the Netherlands-West Germany World Cup qualification match,
police said.
   Dutch fans threatened to storm the stadium unless more tickets
were made available.
   Eights fans were arrested and an undetermined number were
injured in the clashes, which began in the afternoon as fans were
arriving for tonight's match in Rotterdam's Feyenoord stadium, said
police spokesman Ger de Jong.
   Police on horseback and officers in riot gear were called in to
disperse the estimated 500 rioting fans. In one case, a police
helicopter suddenly dived to within about 30 feet above a group of
marauding youngsters.
   Dozens of store windows were smashed, De Jong said. Shopkeepers
lowered steel blinds and boarded up windows in an effort to protect
their property.
   ``It's not really clear to us whether there's a confrontation
going on'' between rival Dutch and West German fans, De Jong told
The Associated Press.
   Most fans in the downtown shopping area, where the rioting took
place, appeared to be Dutch because of their orange scarves. Orange
is the color of the Dutch national team.
   Authorities said the Rotterdam stadium, which holds 57,000
people, was sold out except for 5 percent of the tickets, which
were not being sold to avoid overcrowding. Dutch groups said they
would storm the stadium unless more tickets were sold.
   A stampede at a soccer match April 15 in Sheffield, England,
killed 95 people when fans, some apparently without tickets, rushed
into a standing-room-only section of the stadium.
   Police deployed 600 officers, including 250 riot police, to
quell any disturbances during the match.
   Fans will be subject to rigorous ticket checks and be frisked
before being admitted to the stadium, De Jong said.
   Last year, in the semifinal match of the European soccer
championships, the Dutch national team beat West Germany 2-1. That
event sparked widespread street revelry.
   On Monday, the team of West German coach Franz Beckenbauer was
forced to evacuate its hotel in nearby Wassenaar because of a bomb
threat. No bomb was found. An unidentified person claiming to be a
member of West Germany's Red Army Faction terrorist group made the
threat over the telephone.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For More Oil Drilling in Texas Speech</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today the nation must
accelerate exploratory oil drilling and make greater use of natural
gas and coal resources.
   Saying the United States remains too heavily dependent on
foreign oil more than 15 years after the energy shortage that
produced long gas lines in 1974, Bush told a joint session of the
Texas Legislature: ``We need a national energy policy that relies
not only on oil, but on many other sources.''
   Bush, who set himself up in the Texas oil business in the late
1940s and became a millionaire before entering public life, said in
his prepared remarks, ``I know there are still a few dark clouds
remaining on our economic horizon.''
   But he said Texas is showing signs of recovering from the
business slump brought about by the decline of the energy industry
in recent years, and this has happened because an increasingly
diversified economy has brought tens of thousands of high-tech jobs
to the state.
   ``Still, no matter how diversified and high-tech Texas has
become, a strong domestic energy industry is important to the
future of this state and all of America,'' Bush said. ``I find it
disturbing that nearly 50 percent of America's oil is imported.
This is not good for our national security.''
   Maximizing use of oil resources will make the country less
dependent on imported fuel, he said, and increasing reliance on
alternative energy resources will give the country a cleaner
environment.
   The president reiterated that the nation must not retreat from
oil exploration because of the huge spill from the tanker Exxon
Valdez off the coast of Alaska.
   ``We are using federal resources intelligently in the cleanup
effort,'' he said. ``We are working with industry to develop an
improved plan in the event of a future spill.''
   ``But shutting down our domestic energy production is no answer,
and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil,'' Bush
said. ``To reduce our dependence on foreign oil, we must return to
high levels of exploratory drilling.''
   He said he intends to stimulate domestic oil drilling ``with tax
credits and other incentives.''
   Bush did not cite those incentives. But during his campaign for
the presidency, he suggested a 10 percent tax credit for oil and
gas exploration up to $10 million of costs and 5 percent above that.
   He also proposed eliminating 80 percent of intangible drilling
costs as subject to the alternative minimum tax for independent
producers.
   In his speech today, Bush called on Congress ``at long last, to
fully decontrol natural gas. I believe that this will happen soon.''
   He said he believes the nation ``can and must use more safe
nuclear power'' and said that ``coal has a bright future.''
   ``As we all become increasingly concerned about the need for
clean air, we must look more to natural gas and to nuclear power,''
he said. ``We must produce more of our corn crop to produce
ethanol, more of our natural gas to produce methanol.''
   ``Greater use of these two will rapidly improve the air quality
of our most heavily populated cities,'' the president said.

   Hundreds of protesters jeered and a scuffle
broke out as Chippewa Indians went spearfishing under treaty rights
held since the 1800s.
   Law officers broke up the scuffle Tuesday night at the Big Eau
Pleine Reservoir, which Indian fishermen had reached by driving 100
miles from their reservation in a 30-vehicle convoy escorted by the
State Patrol. No injuries were reported.
   An estimated 400 protesters also gathered at a boat landing at
Lake Nokomis. Three were arrested, two for disorderly conduct and
one for property damage, said George Meyer, state Department of
Natural Resources administrator of enforcement.
   The protesters object to the Chippewa being allowed to leave
their reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and other
trophy-sized fish before the rod-and-reel season begins. The
spearing season began Sunday.
   The Indians' treaty rights were upheld in 1983 by a federal
court.
   At the reservoir, on the southern fringe of Indian land deeded
to the United States in the 1800s, 120 protesters carried an effigy
with ``Injun Joe'' on its shirt and held signs that read, ``Spear
an Indian, save a walleye,'' ``Equal rights for all Americans'' and
``Stop treaty abuse.''
   The crowd cheered when someone yelled, ``Let's scalp 'em.''
   Spectators were separated from tribal fishermen on a boat
landing by a police ribbon. Many surged forward after a Chippewa
crossed in their direction in response to taunts.
   About half a dozen uniformed officers moved in and separated the
man from the hecklers. He said he was pushed and shoved but
unharmed.
   ``They taunted me to walk across and I walked across,'' said
David Vallier, 29. ``They were just being pretty mean and
name-calling.''

   Linda Despot and Donald Woomer are big, big
fans of the Pennsylvania lottery. They bet $100 would get them the
$100 million jackpot in Wednesday's drawing to add to the $46
million they won two years ago.
   ``We want to be part of the action,'' said Woomer, 57, of
Hollidaysburg.
   ``We don't want to be left out,'' said Despot, 38. ``You get
caught up in the excitement of it, so you want to be a part of it.
It's fun.''
   As long as they don't win, that is.
   ``If we win, that's a different story,'' she said.
   ``Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said.
   On Oct. 19, 1987, Woomer and Despot claimed a $46 million
jackpot, which was, at the time, the biggest prize in U.S. history.
   The couple, who have been living together for seven years, quit
their jobs, bought a few things _ cars, a farm, a horse _ and threw
a party with fireworks for their central Pennsylvania town on the
first anniversary of their win.
   But for the most part, Despot and Woomer are spending money as
if they've won thousands, not millions. And they say that's the way
it's going to stay.
   ``They say lotteries are the stuff dreams are made of, and
that's what it is if you don't let it get ahead of you,'' Despot
said in a telephone interview Tuesday night.
   ``Money gives you security so that you don't sit and worry about
your bills. But you still have problems. It's not the answer to
everything. It can't buy you your health. If we get sick, we're
sick like everybody else,'' he said.
   Woomer was a self-employed plasterer and Despot a $13,000-a-year
bookkeeper for a car dealership when Woomer's $25 investment in
lottery tickets won them $46 million in the Super 7 game.
   They quit their jobs and now live on annual installments of $1.4
million, with 20 percent deducted for federal taxes. The payments
are spread over 26 years.
   After 18 months, the millionaire lifestyle is slowly catching on.
   They still live in the same two-story, red-brick house in a
development overlooking a section of Hollidaysburg, a town of
6,000. They plan to build a new home soon. Despot's 15-year-old
daughter, Heather, still attends the public high school, and their
neighbors still take care of their goldfish when they're out of
town.
   ``Most people said we haven't changed,'' Woomer said. ``We're
still ourselves, and this is the way we want to stay. This is our
home town, and we decided this is where we want to live.''
   For the first year, unsolicited requests for money came from
every state and dozens of countries. Despot said she reads all the
letters but rarely answers and never sends money.
   ``After so many of those letters, they all sound alike, and you
don't know which are legitimate or not. We can't start it. We can't
save the world,'' she said. ``We'll know if we're to help somebody.
It will happen. I'm not looking, but it will happen.''

   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop on Wednesday
joined the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer
Society in a campaign to get physicians to help their patients quit
smoking.
   They have put together a brochure outlining basic steps doctors
should take to make smoking advice part of standard medical
practice, and they're sending the pamphlet to 100,000 primary-care
physicians.
   ``Seventy percent of Americans see their doctors at least once a
year,'' Koop said. ``If doctors can get across to their patients
some self-rewarding goal for stopping smoking, I believe the
problem can be nearly licked.''
   About 48 million, or 29 percent, of American adults smoke, and
one in every six deaths in the United States is attributed to the
effects of smoking, according to public health officials.
   The surgeon general, the country's most outspoken public health
official in the fight against smoking, said new clinical trials
conducted by the National Cancer Institute ``show that smokers
whose doctors help them quit are up to six times more likely than
other smokers to kick the habit for good.''
   However, many physicians are reluctant to counsel their patients
on smoking because they are uncomfortable with the subject, don't
believe they can help and feel they are intruding on a patient's
privacy, he said.
   By giving doctors the information they need to help patients
quit and offering training sessions for physicians, Koop believes
doctors will join the campaign and actively work to help their
patients stop smoking.
   ``If only 10 percent of physicians routinely advised smokers to
quit, and succeeded with only one in 20 patients, more than a
million smokers would quit each year'' in addition to the million
or so who already quit annually, said Joseph W. Cullen, deputy
director of the division of cancer prevention and control at the
National Cancer Institute.
   The four-step guidelines, developed by the institute and the
cancer society on the basis of clinical trials, advise physicians
to ask patients about their smoking habits and advise each smoker
to quit.
   Then, doctors are asked to help patients willing to try to quit
by setting a quit date, giving the patient self-help material and
prescribing nicotine gum if needed for heavier smokers. Finally,
they should arrange for follow-up support, including phone calls or
office visits.
   The booklet also advises physicians on how to help patients
manage weight gain and other withdrawal symptoms.
   Nearly half of all American adults who have ever smoked have
stopped, Koop said, noting that physicians have been leading the
way, as less than 10 percent of them smoke.
   ``Now it's time for doctors to act in another way _ to preach
what they practice,'' Koop said.

<HEAD>Vietnam to Hand Over 21 Sets of Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam on Thursday will return 21 sets
of remains that it believes may be the remains of Americans missing
from the Vietnam War.
   A U.S. military team is to pick up the remains in a ceremony at
Hanoi airport, then fly them to army laboratories in Honolulu for
analysis and identification.
   More than 1,700 Americans are listed as missing in action in
Vietnam while others are missing in Cambodia, Laos and China. The
war ended in April 1975 with a communist victory over the
U.S.-backed South Vietnam government.
   Vietnam has returned large numbers of remains since August 1987,
when it agreed to accelerate cooperation on the issue in exchange
for Washington's help in encouraging private humanitarian aid to
Vietnam.
   Ten U.S. military specialists have been in Vietnam since April
12, working with Vietnamese counterparts in the fifth joint field
investigation on MIAs. They are interviewing villagers who
witnessed plane crashes and seeking other evidence of the missing
men.
   The investigators will work until April 30 in the longest such
project thus far.
   Progress on the MIA and other humanitarian issues between the
United States and Vietnam has been hampered by the lack of
diplomatic relations, blocked by Washington's opposition to Hanoi's
military occupation of Cambodia. Vietnam has announced it will
withdraw all its troops by Sept. 30.

<HEAD>Vineyard to Pay Anheuser-Busch $1.1 Million for Grape Switch</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vineyard accused of trying to squeeze too
much profit from Anheuser-Busch by passing off wine made from
cheaper grapes instead of zinfandel has agreed to pay the alcohol
company nearly $1.1 million.
   The settlement, made last month and disclosed in court documents
Tuesday, involved a lawsuit filed in federal court earlier this
year.
   The suit said Anheuser-Busch had contracted to buy 900 tons of
100 percent zinfandel grapes from Bavaro Brothers, a grower in the
San Joaquin Valley town of Escalon. The grapes were to be sent to
Verdugo Vineyards in Acampo for processing into white zinfadel wine.
   But a government inspection found some of the wine delivered to
Master Cellars, an Anheuser-Busch division, was made from as little
as 22.9 percent zinfandel juice. That meant the wine, by law, could
not be sold as white zinfandel.
   ``Instead of having a value of $1 million, it's worth barely
$197,359,'' the suit said.
   Under the agreement approved by U.S. District Judge A. Wallace
Tashima, Bavaro agreed to pay Anheuser-Busch nearly $1.1 million.
In return, Bavaro can try to sell the thousands of gallons of wine
and apply the money to the settlement.
   A ton of zinfandel grapes can sell for $950, compared to $150
for, say, chenin blanc, according to the suit.

<HEAD>House Panel Begins Amending Bush S&amp;L Package</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 9th graf, After the, to CORRECT name of bank to Frost National
Bank of San Antonio.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The House Banking Committee today prayed for
divine guidance to rise above ``narrow self-interest'' as it began
work on savings and loan legislation, and then immediately adopted
a provision designed to favor the hometown bank of a powerful
lawmaker.
   Other amendments to help out two of the nation's largest bank
holding companies _ First Interstate of California and Chemical
Bank of New York _ swiftly followed.
   The votes came as the panel debated legislation recommended by
the Bush administration to bail out the savings and loan industry,
and the thorny issue of what type of capital requirements should be
imposed on S&amp;Ls.
   Both the administration and the two party leaders on the
committee now want to make S&amp;L owners put up $2.25 of their own
money as ``tangible'' capital for every $100 they lend.
   ``If we adopt weak standards _ and allow the kitchen sink to
count as capital _ we are voting to shift the burden to the
taxpayers,'' committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, said in an
opening statement.
   However, Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., chairman of the panel's
financial institutions subcommittee, said the new standards will
drive healthy, honest S&amp;L operators out of business and precipitate
the need for another taxpayer-financed bailout in the future.
   ``Instead of going in and removing the crooks, we are choosing
to launch a poison gas attack on the industry and adopting the
philosophy of `kill 'em all,''' Annunzio said.
   The unusual opening prayer was offered by Del. Walter Fauntroy,
D-D.C., a Baptist minister, who said that in his 19 years in
Congress he had never felt such a need for divine guidance before.
   After the prayer, the committee approved, 37-11, an amendment
that Gonzalez said was intended to protect from a liability
provision only the Frost National Bank of San Antonio, his hometown.
   Annunzio, who favors less-stringent S&amp;L capital standards than
the administration now wants, led the opposition. ``Your amendement
comes at a bad time,'' he told Gonzalez. ``Everyone is asking for
private legislation.''
   Immediately afterwards, the committee approved an amendment by
Reps. Elizabeth Patterson, D-S.C., Thomas Carper, D-Del., and Steve
Bartlett, R-Texas, exempting First Interstate and Chemical Bank
from financial liability in their acquisition of two institutions
in Texas.
   Both amendments were unopposed by the administration. Several
more calling for similar exemptions were on the committee's
schedule.
   Gonzalez said his, Wylie's and the administration's new desire
for stricter capital standards than first sought are ``the guts of
this whole issue.''
   Anything less, he said, will ``simply mean that we let the
industry, once again, roll the dice with taxpayers' money.''
   However, S&amp;L supporters and even some of the industry's harshest
critics in the past expressed fears that a new demand for a cash
equity infusion that large and that quickly _ by June 1991 _ will
drive 800 to 1,200 of the nation's 2,950 remaining thrifts out of
business.
   ``The Bush administration wants to come in and practice
euthanasia on institutions that are not in trouble,'' complained
Rep. John J. LaFalce, D-N.Y., a past critic of S&amp;L practices.
``These immediate and precipitous demands are going to create a
bank panic that will bring 10 times as much trouble as we need.''
   LaFalce said Bush's initial $90 billion bailout proposal was
built on the premise that roughly 500 S&amp;Ls would fail the capital
test he first sought, instead of the 800 to 1,200 that would be
unable to meet the proposed new $2.25 ``tangible'' standard.
   ``If we drive institutions unnecessarily into insolvency, it is
the American taxpayer who will bear the increased cost _ a far
greater cost than anyone is presently contemplating,'' he said.
   Congressional sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
estimated the cost to the government of liquidating S&amp;Ls that fail
to meet the proposed new ``tangible'' capital standard at $130
billion _ twice what Bush's initial proposal and a Senate-approved
version would cost.
   Bush's initial proposal unveiled in February called for doubling
the capital required of S&amp;Ls from the current 3 percent to 6
percent. But none of that capital under his proposal had to be
``tangible'' _ in the form of stock or retained earnings easily
convertible to cash.
   Theoretically, an S&amp;L could remain in business with no direct
equity investment by its owners under Bush's initial legislative
initiative.
   The House Banking Committee's financial institutions
subcommittee two weeks ago imposed a 1.5 percent ``tangible''
capital requirement, as did the Senate last week.
   Both of those actions were praised by administration officials,
who then decided late last week that even more ``tangible'' capital
should be required, according to congressional and administration
sources.
   Among the 2,700 technically solvent S&amp;Ls at the end of the year,
only about half of their $60 billion in capital was ``tangible.''
   The rest _ $21 billion in so-called ``supervisory good will,''
$4 billion in subordinated debt and $3 billion in deferred loan
losses _ is all the result of what critics call ``smoke and
mirrors'' accounting practices.
   That ``phantom capital'' accounting was greatly expanded by
Congress and the Reagan administration in the early 1980s to
encourage healthy S&amp;Ls to take over sick ones as a way of avoiding
payouts from the federal deposit insurance fund, which is insolvent
itself.

   Pennsylvania's North American record lottery jackpot of at least
$100 million dwarfs the previous top 10.
   Spain's El Gordo, or ``the fat one,'' boasts the world's richest
lottery jackpot. A $159 million first prize last December was split
by hundreds of people.
   A $100 million Pennsylvania Super 7 jackpot, if won by one
person Wednesday night, would mean almost $3.85 million a year for
26 years for the winner.
   Marc Narducci, editor of Lottery Player's Magazine, Moorestown,

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor calls it the biggest white-collar
crime case in state history, with the main trial expected to last
three months and charges pending in several counties _ and it all
concerns a clam.
   Not just any clam. This is about the world's second-largest
species of clam, a long-necked ugly thing called a geoduck,
pronounced gooey-duck, after an Indian word for ``dig deep.''
   With about 135 workers, Washington's geoduck industry in 1987
generated $1.8 million for the state, which leases tracts for
harvesting in Puget Sound, Hood Canal and other inland marine
waters. State officials said they had no figures on the commercial
value of the harvest.
   At an auction this spring, four of 12 bidders won rights to
seven tracts covering 300 acres at a record average price of 68
cents a pound, said James McKillip of the state Department of
Fisheries. Depending on the catch, the state could realize $1.9
million to $3.5 million, said Bob Hoyser, a state Department of
Natural Resources leasing manager.
   But booming demand also generated ``Clamscam,'' a complex
criminal case against seven people and eight corporations and a
``criminal profiteering'' civil suit against most of the same
parties and a few others.
   The defendants are accused of overharvesting and taking geoducks
from outside their leased tracts since 1970.
   The clams are found along the West Coast from British Columbia
to Southern California and weigh as much as 10 pounds.
   Washington and neighboring British Columbia have the only
noteworthy geoduck industries, with average known harvests of 4.6
million pounds in Washington and 10 million pounds in British
Columbia between 1980 and 1985, said McKillip.
   In the United States geoduck is frequently used in canned and
fast-food chowder and occasionally as an entree in restaurants.
   ``It's got kind of a sweet taste. You can tell'' when it's used
in chowder, said McKillip.
   The succulent flesh also is a sushi superstar and top-quality
live geoducks sell for as much as $12 a pound in Japan.
   But the monster mollusks look, well, odd, with a sinuous brown
neck or siphon that extends from several inches to a few feet out
of a shell six inches or longer, producing disgust, disdain and
occasional titters at seafood stands.
   ``Would you promise me one thing? Please don't call me the
geoduck queen,'' pleaded King County deputy prosecutor Marilyn B.
Brenneman in a telephone interview last week. ``This is the kind of
case that could follow me the rest of my life.''
   Brian D. Hodgson, 50, of Olympia; Carol K. Kondo, 58, of Federal
Way, and Mark E. Pearce, 37, of Olympia, each could face life in
prison if convicted of leading organized crime. Four others,
including Kondo's daughter, Cindy Rommel, face lesser felony
charges.
   As top officers, suppliers and associates of the now-defunct
Washington King Clam Inc. of Fife and related companies, they are
accused of illegally taking more than 1 million pounds of geoducks
worth at least $1.8 million.
   Brenneman called it ``the largest state white-collar crime case
ever tried in Washington courts.''
   Two of the nine people initially charged in the criminal case
have pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to testify for
the state.
   Hodgson, Kondo, Pearce, Rommel and another criminal defendant
also are among those being sued by the state for treble damages, an
amount that could exceed $3 million.
   Brenneman predicted the King County criminal trial will last at
least three months with testimony from 130 to 150 of the 180
potential witnesses she has listed. She also planned to present
1,000 to 2,000 of the 70,000 bank records, shipping receipts and
other documents identified as potential evidence.
   Jury selection began last week and was expected to run at least
through late this week, court officials said.
   Charges involving other areas of Puget Sound and Hood Canal are
pending in Kitsap, Mason, Jefferson and Pierce counties.
   Washington King Clam, formed in 1970 by Hodgson with Kondo
holding a minority interest, led in developing the export trade and
in recent years controlled 90 percent of the state's geoduck
industry, McKillip said.
   Documents filed by Prosecutor Norm Maleng said about 40 former
Washington King Clam employees or business associates told of
illegal harvesting of the brobdingnagian bivalves since the company
was formed.
   Dan Donohoe of the prosecutor's office said the 20-month
investigation unearthed a pattern of crimes that began as far back
as 1970 and continued over the years, with the most recent incident
last October.
   With the filing of charges last fall, the state canceled five
leases to Geoduck Harvest, by then owned by a Japanese company, and
principals in the case were banished from further bidding.

   President Bush said today he wants former
President Reagan to take on ``various missions and assignments'' in
the foreign policy field.
   Answering reporters questions as he and Reagan began a meeting
at the former president's office here, Bush said he wanted to keep
Reagan ``fully informed'' about world events.
   The president also said that in his talks with some 35 world
leaders since taking office last Jan. 20, he has found that ``the
respect for him (Reagan) around the world knows no bounds.''
   ``I hope I can talk him into various missions and assignments as
time goes by,'' Bush said as he sat next to the man he served as
vice president for eight years.
   Reagan said he considers the White House ``in good hands'' as
Bush nears the 100-day mark of his presidency and that his
successor was ``doing fine.''
   Bush did not specify what assignments he was considering giving
to Reagan, and the former president did not respond to Bush's
statement about his plan.
   But Bush did say that ``I have a lot more to learn from
President Reagan, and I learned a lot about principle and the world
as it really is. I wanted to talk to him about change abroad ...
get his advice.''
   Neither Bush nor Reagan would respond to reporters' questions
about the Iran-Contra trial of fired White House aide Oliver North
on grounds the matter was still before the courts. ``Here's one
where I think we're both in the same boat,'' Reagan said.
   Reporters had asked Reagan whether he had been aware of White
House documents that were never seen by the congressional
investigative committees.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Tuesday that
Bush has talked by phone to Reagan a few times. Bush, chatting with
reporters aboard Air Force One earlier this week, said, ``I don't
ever say what I talk to the president about.''
   But then Bush did acknowledge he had called Reagan recently to
discuss news reports that quoted Bush aides anonymously as making
disparaging statements about Reagan. ``I thought an explanation was
in order,'' the president said.
   One such story, which had unnamed Bush aides mocking Reagan's
laid-back management style, led White House chief of staff John
Sununu to warn presidential aides against making such statements.
   The Bush-Reagan meeting comes at a time when Bush is making
high-profile public appearances aimed at restating administration
themes as Bush nears the 100-day mark of his presidency.
   Bush put in a 14-hour day in California Tuesday, giving a
business-oriented speech at the Ford Aerospace plant in Palo Alto,
then visiting a 213-acre ranch in the Orange County hill country
that had been a drug distribution center.
   He was reunited with Hispanic Republican supporters on the
campus of the University of California at Los Angeles and wound up
the day by watching major league baseball's Baltimore Orioles beat
the California Angels 8-1 at Anaheim Stadium.
   ``Many of you know the history of the ground we stand on,'' said
Bush, as he stood before huge stacks of money _ more than $4
million _ seized in the raid that broke up the drug-dealing center.
   ``Once a warehouse of death, now it's a source of hope,'' he
said.
   Speaking to the Hispanic audience, Bush noted that he soon was
to meet with ``one of America's greatest presidents. I'm talking
about California's always-favorite son and my good friend, Ronald
Reagan.''
   The former president and his wife, Nancy, are enjoying their
retirement here, said Reagan spokesman Mark Weinberg. He said the
Reagans spend a considerable amount of time answering mail and will
continue to travel and speak.
   But the former president has not attracted huge crowds at some
public speaking engagements, and he recently waived his $50,000
honorarium when a smaller-than-expected crowd turned out for a
speech at Arizona State University.
   In his more than three months in office, Bush also has distanced
himself from some Reagan policies and has adopted a more energetic
presidential management style.
   Bush, though a lifelong member of the National Rifle
Association, has moved to limit the proliferation of assault-type
weapons by imposing a ban on imports of many of these guns.
   Unlike Reagan, he moved quickly to strike a bipartisan agreement
with Congress that essentially puts the United States on a
diplomatic, rather than military, course, in seeking democratic
reforms in Nicaragua.
   Bush also has proposed a more far-reaching ethics package and
will likely seek a strengthening of the Clean Water Act, a more
environmentalist position than Reagan took.

<HEAD>Bangladesh Gets Rain After Residents Offer Prayers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rain fell in parts of Bangladesh on
Wednesday after people across the country prayed for an end to a
drought that threatens to destroy almost 50 percent of the rice
crop.
   Hours after the prayer by more than 75,000 Moslems led by
President Hussain Muhammad Ershad, it rained in the capital of
Dhaka and three other districts, the weather bureau said.
   The rain, .16 inches to .96 inches, was not enough to ease
drought conditions, but it was a welcome relief.
   Religious Affairs Minister Nizamuddin Al Azad said people knelt
in mosques, temples, churches and pagodas across the nation to pray
for rain. Thousands more could not attend the ceremonies because of
traffic jams.
   About 26 of the country's 63 administrative districts have been
suffering by a lack of rainfall. Agriculture is the main occupation
of most of the country's 110 million people.
   Some areas have irrigation channels and pumps but most of the
canals ran dry when subterranean ground water levels plunged, news
reports said.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest countries with a per
capita annual income of $160, alternates between flood and drought.
Last summer, more than 1,400 people died in floods that submerged
four-fifths of the low-lying nation.
   Bangladesh produces about 17 million tons of grains a year. The
target of the spring rice crop _ which has been affected this year
by the drought _ was 5.6 million tons.
   In addition, Bangladesh imports about 2 million tons of grains a
year to meet the shortfall of 1.5 million tons in production and
build a reserve.
   The drought and the hot weather has also threatened operations
at the country's lone hydroelectric power plant near the southern
port city of Chittagong, about 120 miles southeast of Dhaka. The
project was set up in the mid-1960s by the United States.
   Weather forecasters say there will be no respite from the
drought for another two weeks, and a hot spell will aggravate the
situation in the coming days.
   An Agriculture Ministry official said nearly half the crop would
be destroyed if the drought persisted a few more days.
   ``I fear the crop loss may be 50 percent of the total. No rains
in the next few days may spell disaster for agriculture,'' the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A senior government official said Monday the government had
sufficient grain reserves to prevent people from starving.
   ``The government is determined that no one will die for want of
food,'' said Relief Minister Sirajul Hussain Khan.

   Representatives of the nation's cities and
counties pleaded with Congress Wednesday not to use higher gasoline
taxes to reduce the federal deficit.
   ``The federal gasoline tax has been used to construct a fine
highway system in this country and it should only continue to be
used to improve and enhance this system,'' James J. Snyder,
president of the National Association of Counties and a Cattaraugus
County, N.Y., legislator, told a news conference.
   ``The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that between
$261 billion and $314 billion in capital investment is needed just
to maintain the nation's urban road network at 1985 levels,'' said
Irving Mager, an Annapolis, Md., alderman speaking for the National
League of Cities.
   ``We must not let a serious problem grow into a calamity by
diverting the funding source that is intended for our vital
transportation needs,'' Mager said.
   Some key members of Congress advocate a hefty increase in the
9.1-cent-a-gallon tax to bring down the budget deficit. The levy
now is earmarked for transportation.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, speaks often in favor of such an increase,
although President Bush has specifically listed a gasoline tax as
one he opposes.
   City and county officials spoke at a news conference sponsored
by The Road Information Program, which is financed by the highway,
energy and insurance industries.
   William M. Wilkins, executive director of the organization, said
a 50-cent increase in the tax would reduce federal, state and local
spending for roads and bridges by more than $28 billion over the
next 10 years.

   Masayoshi Ito, a senior politician with a
reputation for integrity and consensus building, has led Japan
through troubled times before.
   Now chairman of the Executive Council, the governing party's
main decision-making body, Ito is considered a likely successor to
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita because of his experience in senior
party posts and his image as a clean politician untainted by the
Recruit influence-peddling scandal.
   Ito appears to be reluctant to accept the post of acting prime
minister, saying his age _ 75 _ and his health problems as a
diabetic should disqualify him. Nevertheless, many observers
believe he would serve if asked.
   Ito served as acting Prime Minister nearly 10 years ago
following the sudden death of his political mentor, Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira.
   It was a difficult time for the Liberal Democrats. They had just
suffered serious losses in an election called by Ohira. Then,
divided by internal battles, the governing party lost a
no-confidence vote in Parliament.
   National elections followed less than two weeks later.
   Under Ito's stewardship, the governing party closed ranks and
won. Zenko Suzuki became prime minister in July 1980 and named Ito
as foreign minister.
   Ito served in that capacity until 1982 when he resigned in a
dispute over relations between Japan and the United States.
   After a summit meeting, the opposition objected when the
government used the term ``alliance'' to describe the Japanese-U.S.
ties. The government blamed Ito's ministry for failing to explain
the term did not imply Japan would build up its military or be
dragged into future U.S. wars.
   Ito resigned in typical Japanese fashion to ``accept
responsibility'' for mixup, a move that further bolstered his
reputation for integrity.
   Hideo Sato, dean of the University of Tsukuba's College of
International Relations, said Japan would do well to offer Ito the
job.
   ``I think we need exactly that kind of person to cope with the
crisis,'' Sato said. Ito ``is a low-profile person, a consensus
builder. He is apparently not involved in big money-making
connections with business.''
   Ito also has no party power base of his own and is instead a
member of a faction headed by Kiichi Miyazawa, a former prime
minister hopeful who was forced to resign as finance minister due
to ties with Recruit.
   Ito, a 1936 graduate of the prestigious Law Faculty of Tokyo
University, which has produced much of Japan's postwar elite, was
elected to the House of Representatives for eight straight terms
from a prefecture in northern Japan.
   His first term in elected office began in 1963, after he rode
the bureaucratic fast track to the posts of vice minister of
agriculture and forestry and director general of the Fisheries
Agency.
   Ito served as chairman of the Policy Affairs Research Council,
one of the party's top three positions, under Takeshita's
predecessor, Yasuhiro Nakasone.

<HEAD>Early Assessments In, Bush Not Yet Tested</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

   Under the handy but artificial deadline of 100
days, President Bush is receiving the first report card of his
presidency before any real test of his ability to handle the job.
   The early assessments offer neither rave reviews nor harsh
criticism. Bush wins praise for his outstretched, bipartisan hand
and his open style, but catches grief for what he might call ``the
vision thing,'' his failure to articulate any direction other than
an intention to pursue a moderate version of Reaganism.
   Even Mikhail S. Gorbachev has expressed impatience with how long
it is taking the new administration to complete its foreign policy
review.
   Perhaps the most difficult ordeal of the Bush administration's
first months was the fight over his nomination of former Texas Sen.
John Tower to be secretary of defense.
   The Senate rejected the nomination after a long, partisan
bloodletting, an event sure to leave scars. But despite widespread
expectations that it signalled Congress' intent to challenge the
new president for dominance, the bitter fight has largely faded
from memory.
   In fact, Bush's willingness to work with the
Democratic-controlled Congress has led to compromises on the budget
and Contra aid, issues on which the Reagan administration never
came close to agreement with the Democrats.
   ``I think he's done a pretty good job,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. Mitchell said benchmarks like
100-day assessments were ``completely arbitrary ... simply a
creation of others.''
   While there is no magic to the 100-day mark, Bush himself walked
into that trap. The day after his landslide victory, he said, ``We
will now have 70-whatever days it is to formulate a game plan, a
first 100 days priorities, if you will, and they'll be specific,
and I will do my level best to fulfill my commitments to the
American people.''
   No such specific game plan emerged, either during the transition
or in his inaugural address, which was more an exercise in setting
a stylistic tone than spelling out an agenda.
   ``A good start,'' was the president's own low-key assessment of
his first three months in office.
   He cited bipartisan agreements with Congress on the budget and
Contra aid and his plan to stabilize the troubled savings and loan
industry.
   Presidential scholar James David Barber of Duke University was
less generous: ``I think his grade is incomplete. We still have yet
to see what he's going to do if anything.''
   But the ultimate tests of presidents are events that adhere to
no timetables.
   Let the economy turn sour, the stock market drop or interest
rates, inflation or unemployment jump; or let America's image
abroad be shaken by a terrorist act or other foreign policy crisis
and the public will take its measure of the president's
philosophical bearings and leadership ability.
   Bush has not yet faced a major crisis. His predecessors, Ronald
Reagan and Jimmy Carter, are remembered far differently for their
ability to deal with hard times.
   Few presidents could match Reagan's skill dealing with
adversity, whether it was the prolonged recession that marked his
first two years in the White House or the deaths of 241 American
servicemen in 1983, when a terrorist bomb destroyed a U.S. Marine
barracks in Lebanon.
   Few presidents showed less talent for dealing with adversity
than Carter, who was unable to deflect public unease over an
economy battered by OPEC and the frustration that built during the
Iranian hostage crisis.
   At the hundred-day mark of their administrations, Reagan and
Carter either couldn't predict or didn't recognize the events on
which their terms would be judged.
   Carter began with the image of a president with a distinctive
style who knew where he wanted to go. He gave a positive assessment
of his first 100 days, citing his energy program, nuclear arms
reduction proposals and emphasis on human rights.
   Four years later, Reagan was firmly in charge and looking
certain to win congressional approval of his tax and budget cutting
proposals. He weathered an assassination attempt and gave a clear
demonstration of the style and wit that would serve him so well
throughout his presidency.
   While Reagan was president, he clearly was the dominant figure
in Washington.
   Is Bush somehow less a commanding figure than his predecessor?
   ``For six of his eight years, Reagan had a Republican Senate,''
said Mitchell. ``I think there was a marked difference between
Reagan's first six years and his last two (when the Democrats were
back in control of the Senate). ... I think the fairer test is
Bush's first months against Reagan's last two years and there, I
think the difference is not so great.''
   The Maine Democrat called Bush's effort to reach out to Congress
``a marked improvement over the Reagan years.'' He cited the
agreement on Contra aid, which he said was ``an initiative of his
administration.''
   But Bush didn't escape free of criticism. Mitchell said there
was ``a complete failure of leadership on the Alaska oil spill,''
and he criticized Bush's stands on legislation to increase the
minimum wage and to intervene in the Eastern Air Lines strike.
   ``Both he and we recognize there will be differences,'' said
Mitchell.

   The Bush administration came down Wednesday on
the side of the changes Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has
engineered in the Communist Party leadership and said it hoped the
result would be a strengthening of democratization and openness.
   In a statement, the administration described Gorbachev's purge
of 74 Central Committee full voting members and the promotion of
several of the Soviet leader's proteges as dramatic and stressed
they were a matter of internal Soviet policy.
   But the administration then went on express hope that ``whatever
changes occur, their effect is to strengthen and promote the reform
process in the Soviet Union toward greater democratization and
openness.''
   The statement was read by Margaret Tutwiler, the State
Department spokeswoman, in response to questions at the
department's daily press brefing. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III will hold talks in Moscow May 10-11 with Gorbachev and Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   They are expected to set a date for a resumption of U.S.-Soviet
negotiations to reduce long-range nuclear missiles and to discuss
prospects for Arab-Israeli negotiations. Baker also may make
preliminary preparations with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze for a
summit meeting between President Bush and the Soviet leader.
   Bakr last week praised the economic reform program Gorbachev has
undertaken but said the Soviet leader could be in trouble unless
``there are consumer goods on the table and in the markets.''
   Baker told the American Society of Newspaper Editors that the
risk to the Soviet leader could come from opponents of change,
entrenched elements of the bureaucracy and from ``sources of
nationalistic discontent.''
   He said Gorbachev's economic program, known in Russian as
perestroika, was in the best interest of the United States and the
world because it would lead to a more secure and stable Soviet
Union.
   ``We very much want perestroika to succeed,'' Baker said in
response to a question after a speech. ``We very much want the
general secretary to succeed.''
   But, Baker said, political reform in the Soviet Union was
proceeding faster than economic reform. ``That might trigger
something,'' he said. ``These things generally have to proceed
apace.''
   The purged 74 party officials and another 35 non-voting members
who also were jettisoned represented a potential source of
opposition to Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``The situation has changed considerably, comrades,'' Gorbachev
said after the removal of nearly one-fourth of the Central
Committee membership. ``Vast changes have taken place over this
period also in state bodies, and this required personnel changes.''

   A man pulled his son off a life-support system
today while holding hospital staff members at bay with a gun and
cradled the baby in his arms until the child died, authorities said.
   Rudy Linares, 23, of Cicero, was charged with murdering his
16-month-old son, Samuel, said Lisa Howard, spokeswoman for the
Cook County state's attorney's office.
   Police said Linares and his wife, Tamara, walked into
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center about 1 a.m. and were
escorted to the pediatric intensive care unit, where their son's
breathing had been sustained on a ventilator since an accident in
August.
   About 20 minutes later, Linares pulled out a .357-caliber
handgun, ordered the lone nurse out of the unit, unhooked the
infant from the life-support system and sat with his son in his
arms, said police Sgt. William Rooney.
   The child died about 30 minutes later, Rooney said.
   About a half-dozen security personnel responded to the nurse's
call for help, and gathered just outside the room.
   ``I'm not here to hurt anyone. I'll only hurt you if you try to
plug my baby back in,'' Rooney quoted Linares as saying.
   ``He never pointed the gun at anyone other than the child,''
said Rooney. ``He sat there in a chair until the baby had expired,
then turned the gun over to the officers.''
   Linares ``did a lot of crying,'' said Detective Gary Bulava.
   Mrs. Linares said the couple had planned to see a lawyer Friday
about having the child's life-support system disconnected. She was
not charged in the case.
   ``This is the best thing,'' she said in an interview with radio
station WBBM-AM. ``Sammy is out of his misery.''
   Hospital spokeswoman Carolyn Reed said Samuel had been brought
to Rush-Presbyterian by ambulance last summer after he swallowed an
object _ believed to be either a balloon or a small piece of
aluminum foil _ that blocked his windpipe.
   Oxygen deprivation left him ``partially brain dead,'' and he had
been in a coma since his arrival, said Ms. Reed. Doctors had
notified the parents earlier Tuesday that the child was to be
transferred to a long-term care unit, she added.
   ``You can understand the motivation,'' said Rooney. ``I guess he
didn't want his child to continue living under those conditions.''
   Bulava said Linares unhooked his son's life-support system
during a visit Dec. 30, but the staff reconnected the apparatus.
When Linares arrived today, he spoke briefly with security
personnel but was not searched, Bulava said.
   Rooney said Linares is a painter who has two other children,
both under 5.
   In 1985, a father shot to death his severely brain-damaged
3-year-old daughter in a hospital crib in Miami. Charles Leroy
Griffith, who was sentenced to life in prison for murder, said he
``didn't want to see her hurt anymore.'' The girl has been injured
when her head became caught in the foot rest of a living room
recliner.

   The actor who played Little Ricky on the
``I Love Lucy'' show said Wednesday he spent more time with Lucille
Ball than he did with his own family in the five years he played
the comedian's TV son.
   Miss Ball died of a ruptured aorta at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles Wednesday morning, hospital officials said.
She was 77.
   ``She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so
I was not shocked by her death,'' said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age
6 began playing Miss Ball's drum-playing son on the comedy series
that continues in syndication around the world. ``I'm sure all this
is going to hit me a little later on.''
   Thibodeaux grew up on the set, playing Little Ricky from 1956
until 1961 under Miss Ball's watchful eye.
   ``I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was
very much in control of everything,'' said Thibodeaux, who began
playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and
is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group.
He lives in Jackson with his wife, Kathy, a ballerina.
   Thibodeaux, 38, said he got his break in show business when big
band leader Horace Heidt persuaded his father to bring him from
Lafayette, La., to California for the ``Swift Premium Hour,'' a
traveling radio show that led to a string of one-night stands
across the country.
   That led to an audition for the ``I Love Lucy'' role in
Hollywood.
   ``I remember Lucy saying, `that's him,' and from that time I was
Little Ricky,'' said Thibodeaux, who then used the name Richard
Keith. ``I signed a seven-year contract with the studio in 1956 and
the first episode I was in was aired that December with Bob Hope _
I just turned 6.''
   Thibodeaux said that during the series' run he spent as much
time with Miss Ball as with his own family in Lafayette.
   ``And I spent more time with her off the set at her home than at
the studio,'' he said. ``I remember her as very strict but with a
lot of love. She had her ways but despite all, she was a great
person, very, very talented.
   ``I know everybody remembers her as zany and wacky but that was
only on the show. Actually, she was just the opposite and was very
serious. ... That's what made her a great actress.''
   He said Miss Ball often gave him gifts and that he remembers
spending at least one Christmas at her home.
   ``I remember she once gave me an Indian tepee, then my own
dressing room,'' he said. ``She gave me bicycles and an identical
set of drums.''

   Thieves took nearly $1,000 from

shooting the movie ``Madonna and the Dragon,'' police said
Wednesday.
   Beals, 25, best known for starring in the 1983 hit
``Flashdance,'' discovered the theft when she returned to her room
at the swank Manila Pavillion hotel late Monday night, said police
Sgt. Potenciano Gregorio.
   ``Beals said she left some 23,000 pesos in three envelopes
inside her purse while she went out to shoot some scenes for her
new movie,'' Gregorio said. ``But when she returned, she only found
2,500 pesos ($125) left.''
   Gregorio said police were questioning employees because the room
did not appear to be broken into.

<HEAD>Regulators Considering Deal to Create Nation's Biggest Utility</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators on Wednesday took a first
step in considering whether to approve a merger of Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, a hotly contested
deal that would create the nation's largest private utility.
   The case has broad implications for the electric power industry,
including a possible impact on legal and political clashes over
utilities' use of their monopolistic powers.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission voted to send the
proposed California merger to an administrative law judge for
hearings on a limited number of issues. The judge would then
recommend a final action by the commission.
   Last week, stockholders of the two utilities approved the deal,
under which Southern California Edison's parent company, SCEcorp,
based in Rosemead, would acquire San Diego Gas &amp; Electric in a
stock swap valued at about $2.56 billion. The surviving company
would be controlled by SCEcorp.
   The deal requires approval by a variety of regulatory agencies,
including the California Public Utilities Commission and the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
   The San Diego utility serves 1 million customers in San Diego
County and parts of Orange County. Southern California Edison has
3.8 million customers in central and southern California.
   The two utilities have pledged to cut power rates for San Diego
commercial, industrial and agricultural customers by 5 percent, and
to make a 10 percent reduction in rates for residential customers.
This would mean a savings to customers over the next decade of $1.7
billion, the companies have said.
   San Diego and several other California cities, as well as the
state attorney general and some utility industry associations are
opposed to the proposed merger on a variety of grounds, mainly that
it would dimnish competition.
   The city of San Diego has raised especially strong objections.
It has accused Southern California Edison of coercing the San Diego
utility into agreeing to the merger.
   A legal petition by the city includes depositions from two
former members of the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric board of directors
who testified under oath that Southern California Edison
``inflicted transmission access problems'' on its merger target.
The city claims this was done to pressure San Diego Gas &amp; Electric
to agree.
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier said there was
not enough evidence of coercion to formally consider the matter,
but in its order Wednesday the commission said it would allow the
city of San Diego to present more information.
   In its order to the administrative law judge, the commission
rejected a request by a group of California cities, including
Riverside and Anaheim, to deny the merger before holding hearings.
The cities contend the merger is anti-competitive.
   The federal order also rejected a request by the city of San
Diego that the merger's possible environmental implications be made
part of the review process.
   The commission said that based on currently available
information, the proposed merger raised no issues that would
require an environmental impact statement. It added, however, that
it might reconsider the matter if new evidence arose later in the
merger review.
   Among the issues to be considered at the administrative law
hearing are the probable effects of the merger on utility rates and
the expected benefits of integrating the two merging companies'
electrical generation and transmission systems.
   No date was set for the hearings. The companies' merger
agreement of last year sets a deadline of March 31, 1990, for
gaining final regulatory approval.

   The death toll from a killer apparently stalking
prostitutes and drug users rose to nine Wednesday as investigators
tentatively identified another body left along a southeastern
Massachusetts highway.
   Authorities said an autopsy on the ninth victim, found Monday
along Interstate 195 in Marion, yielded a preliminary
identification. But they declined to release the name pending
confirmation with dental records.
   Police said the position of the body and other details matched
those of the previous eight victims, all women ages 25 to 36 who
lived in or near the seaport of New Bedford.
   But investigators declined to make the details public, citing a
rash of false confessions.
   ``We have people who have come in here and confessed to these
crimes, but we ask them, `How did you do it? What transpired? How
did you leave the women?' and the information they give is just
very wrong,'' said Jim Martin, a spokesman for the Bristol County
district attorney's office.
   Accounts by a highway worker and others who found the bodies
have led to speculation that the women have been strangled with
their clothing and left face down, or in fetal positions. But
almost any conversation on a New Bedford street is likely to yield
a new theory.
   None of the murders appears to be recent. Forensic experts said
the bodies, all found since July, had been lying along the highways
for months.
   Despite the decomposed state of the bodies, investigators have
been able to identify all of the previous eight as drug users or
prostitutes.
   Bristol County District Attorney Ronald A. Pina has said he has
several suspects, and a grand jury has been hearing evidence for
months, but no indictments have been issued.

<HEAD>Debate Over Where to Inter Rest of Author's Ashes</HEAD>

   It's the kind of story William Saroyan
might have written, if he were still alive.
   The plot:
   What to do with the ashes of the late author, that is to say the
half of his ashes that weren't sent to Soviet Armenia after he died
in 1981 at age 72.
   The characters in this ``Human Comedy,'' to borrow the title of
Saroyan's most popular novel:
   _ Friends who want his remaining ashes interred in the local
Armenian cemetery topped by a monument fitting for Fresno's famous
native son.
   _ The William Saroyan Foundation, which isn't certain what
should be done with Saroyan's ashes.
   _ Newspaper columnist Eli Setencich who is having the time of
his life writing about Saroyan's ashes.
   It was Setencich who started the fuss by writing in his Fresno
Bee column last week that half of Saroyan's ashes still were
sitting on a shelf in a local mortuary, and some folks were
thinking of putting them in Ararat Cemetery.
   An Associated Press story about Setencich's musings drew the
attention of Robert Setrakian, president of the William Saroyan
Foundation in San Francisco, which was one of the places Saroyan
spent time when he wasn't in Fresno or Paris.
   Setrakian wrote a letter to Ben Amirkhanian, one of the Fresno
folks who favors a move to the cemetery for Saroyan's ashes, which
are encased in an urn carrying an inscription that calls Saroyan an
``author and humanitarian.''
   ``Frankly, I find this whole article disturbing what with the
apparent cavalier approach by some of Mr. Saroyan's friends, as
well intentioned as they may be,'' Setrakian wrote.
   The letter pointed out that Saroyan directed that upon his death
he be cremated and half of his ashes be taken ``to an appropriate
location in Armenia.''
   The directive quoted by Setrakian makes no mention of any
desired final resting place for the other half of his ashes,
whether on a shelf or wherever.
   Setrakian insisted, however, that the foundation has legal
control of the ashes. He said trustees would consult with Saroyan's
sister, Cosette Saroyan, about her wishes.
   Amirkhanian said Tuesday Saroyan's sister ``thought it was a
wonderful idea'' to build a monument at the cemetery, and he would
work with the foundation in an attempt to locate the ashes there.
   Setencich concluded on Wednesday that Saroyan probably is up
there somewhere enjoying the squabble over his ashes and ``writing
a neat story about it.''

   More than 80 influential Palestinians in the
occupied territories Wednesday turned down Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir's plan for elections leading to an interim solution to the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.
   In their first formal response to the Shamir proposal, the
Palestinian leaders said no elections could be held while Israel
maintained forces in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   They derided the Shamir plan as a stalling tactic aimed at
ending the 16-month-old Palestinian uprising and called for
``negotiations with the PLO within the framework of an
international conference until the establishment of a Palestinian
state.'' Many of the statement's signers are pro-PLO figures.
   Shamir's plan calls for elections to select Palestinians from
the occupied territories to hold talks with Israel on an interim
solution for the troubled region. After two years, discussions
would begin toward a permanent solution.
   Shamir rules out any participation by the PLO, which Israel
considers a terrorist organization, and says there never will be an
independent Palestinian state in the territories.
   The plan, outlined by Shamir during a visit to Washington
earlier this month, won the cautious approval of President Bush.
But the Soviet Union and major Arab states, such as Egypt and
Jordan, have said they favor an international conference under U.N.
auspices.
   Shamir's top spokesmen could not be reached for comment because
of the Passover holiday.
   Alon Liel, Foreign Ministry spokesman, said: ``I realize the
difficulty the Palestinians are having with the fact that Shamir is
speaking about an interim agreement and is not indicating anything
about the final status.'' But he said that Israelis fear the gap
between the two sides is too great to bridge without a phased
approach.
   ``I want to stress that the Israeli thinking is if we start from
the end, we won't have a beginning,'' Liel said. ``This is the idea
behind the step-by-step approach that was accepted by the
Americans.''
   The Palestinians' statement, issued in Arab and English,
described the Shamir plan as ``calculated to appeal to the media,
to end the uprising and to win time.'' It insisted that the PLO is
``the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people''
and that any election plan that excluded the PLO was ``an attempt
to divide our people into `inside' and `outside' Palestinians.''
   The statement did not rule out elections entirely but said they
must come in a framework that would lead to formation of a
Palestinian state.
   ``This isolated occurrence of elections does not illustrate how
it will lead to the end of the occupation and to Palestinian
national independence,'' it said.
   The United Nations, it said, should be authorized to administer
the territories during a transitional period to Palestinian
statehood.
   Chief among the 83 signers of the document was Faisal Husseini
of Arab east Jerusalem, who has met with Egyptian officials on the
Shamir plan. He earlier met with Israeli officials on their peace
proposals.
   Husseini is considered the main spokesman for the PLO in the
occupied territories, and he was held in jail without charges for
most of the uprising.
   Others who signed the document included university professor
Sari Nusseibeh of Jerusalem; Haidar Abd al-Shafi, head of the Red
Crescent Society in Gaza; Gabi Baramki, head of Beir Zeit
University; Mayor Hilme Hanoun of Tulkarem; and Audeh al-Ranteesi,
an Anglican priest from Ramallah.

<HEAD>Interior Urged to Strengthen Regulations Used to Estimate Oil Spill
Damage</HEAD>

   Environmental groups and six states called on
the Interior Department on Wednesday to strengthen regulations
being used as guides in estimating damage to natural resources from
the Alaska oil spill.
   The present regulations, which Interior officials have confirmed
are being used in negotiations with Exxon Corp., already are the
subject of a lawsuit claiming they are too lax on polluters and
prevent adequate compensation for major oil or toxic chemical
spills.
   The regulations place ``an absurdly low value on wildlife and
other resources,'' maintained Joan Claybrook, president of Public
Citizen, an advocacy group which is among those who have challenged
the regulations in court.
   The critics asked in a letter to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
that the regulations be rewritten so that more than ``market
value'' of destroyed resources is used in assessing recovery costs
in a long-term settlement on damages caused by the Alaska spill.
   In addition to Ms. Claybrook, the authors of the letter included
the attorneys general of Ohio, Colorado, Maine, Texas, Rhode Island
and Connecticut. The regulations also have been criticized by the
National Wildlife Federation and officials of a number of other
states as being too easy on polluters.
   Interior Department officials acknowledged in interviews Tuesday
that the government has agreed to use guidelines giving polluters
the option of paying only the ``market value'' of resources they
destroy, rather than the cost of restoring the environment to its
pre-spill condition if the market value is cheaper.
   The decision comes despite administration promises to seek
``complete restoration'' of losses from the Exxon Valdez tanker
spill that has fouled Alaska's wildlife-rich Prince William Sound.
   The regulations in question stem from the 1980 Superfund law
which required Interior to establish guidelines on assessing damage
resulting from an oil spill or discharge of toxic chemicals.
   The regulations were supposed to make it easier for states and
federal trustees of public lands to recover damages. But Interior
took nearly six years to draw them up and, according to critics,
did so in 1986 substantially along the lines sought by the oil
industry.
   ``The rules are there, they make sense and we're going to start
to use them,'' said Cecil Hoffman, a senior Interior official
involved with the damage assessment effort. ``The intent is that
we're going to set a dollar value'' on the damages.
   Ms. Hoffman said, however, that the regulations are viewed as a
framework for making the assessments and do not necessarily
preclude other actions being taken.
   The rules, however, are under challenge in the federal courts.
Three environmental groups and 10 states have filed suit accusing
Interior of violating the Superfund law by making the regulations
too lax.
   In February, six weeks before the Exxon spill, the Justice
Department vigorously defended the regulations at a hearing before
the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. No decision has yet been
made by the court.
   ``The rules create a myriad of ... economic, scientific and
administrative obstacles to the recovery of funds needed to restore
damaged resources,'' maintains Eric Glitzenstein, an attorney for
Public Citizen.
   Erik Olson, an lawyer for the National Wildlife Federation,
another plaintiff in the suit, said if the damage assessments are
determined under Interior's regulatory guidelines, Exxon could well
escape substantial liability.
   During the recent court hearing, Justice Department attorneys
defended the reliance on ``use value'' and ``market value'' to
determine damages on natural resources. Lawyers for the
environmental groups and states argued that total cost of
``restoration and replacement'' should be required.
   Under some guidelines, the value of a seal might be as little as
$15 because that has been determined as the value of its pelt,
while a seabird such as the puffin might be merely $7.88, the
environmental lawyers said.
   Other plaintiffs in the suit which was filed last year are the
Environmental Defense Fund and the states of New York, New Jersey,
Ohio, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine,
Rhode Island and Vermont.

<HEAD>Read My Lips: No More Smooching Under Daylight Rule, School Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEDERLAND, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials have embraced a ``Daylight
Rule'' to ban kissing and other affectionate displays between
students, but the American Civil Liberties Union says the rule
smacks of violating constitutional rights.
   The daylight rule, which means daylight must be visible between
students, was enacted at Nederland School last week. About 270
students, grades 7 through 12, attend the rural mountain school
west of Boulder, which offers many teen-agers their primary meeting
place.
   ``As a faculty, we just got tired of saying things to kids about
kissing in the hallways,'' said teacher Marsha Skaro.
   Students who violate the rule get a written warning; a second
offense merits a letter to parents. A parent-student conference
with school authorities is required for the third. Further
discipline is not specified.
   Boulder County schools Superintendent Jim Hagar said the rule is
the school's prerogative.
   However, David Miller, regional legal director of the ACLU, said
discipline beyond notification of parents could threaten
constitutional rights of privacy and freedom of association. ``As
soon as they start to discipline somebody, then we at the ACLU will
take the matter very seriously,'' Miller said Tuesday.
   Students said they resent the crackdown as a violation of basic
human rights that will only drive them into surrounding forests.
   ``I think the teachers are going way too far,'' said Danny
Brennan, 16. ``I'm friends with a lot of girls. And now I can't
even touch them.''
   ``I think it's kind of dumb,'' said Stephanie Dewey, 16, who had
been caught with the arm of Dave Lund, 17, around her shoulders.
The teacher ``told us to be careful . ... But (Dave) goes, `I'll
put my arm around my girlfriend if I want to.' We got written up.''

   A spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command in
Panama was arrested and held in jail for more than 24 hours earlier
this week on charges of possessing marijuana, the command said
Wednesday.
   Mercedes Morris, a civilian employee of the public affairs
office at the Southern Command's headquarters, was arrested Monday
afternoon on returning from a family outing at San Blas Islands,
the command said.
   She was arrested while claiming her baggage at the Paitilla
Airport by Panama Defense Forces officials and taken to a women's
detention center outside Panama City. She was released Tuesday
evening to the custody of American officials.
   The command, in a brief statement, said U.S. officials had filed
a protest with Panama over Morris' treatment, alleging several
violations of the Panama Canal Treaty. They include a failure to
honor the American request for transfer of custody within 10 hours
of detention; not notifying U.S. authorities within two hours of
her detention; not allowing access to Morris by U.S. consular or
military officials, and not allowing Morris legal representation on
request.
   According to defense sources who asked not to be named, U.S.
authorities in Panama have opened an investigation into the
circumstances surrounding Morris' arrest.
   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said
Wednesday the United States was not ruling out the possibility that
Morris' arrest was part of Panama's ``deliberate campaign to harass
U.S. and Panamanian employees of U.S. agencies in Panama.''

<TEXT>
   Arms dealer and financier Adnan
Khashoggi, once reputed to one of the world's wealthiest men,
appeared as prisoner 67391 in police mug shots published Wednesday
in Swiss newspapers.
   The photos of Khashoggi, 54, were dated April 18, the day he was
arrested in Bern on a U.S. warrant charging he helped hide assets
that deposed President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and his
wife Imelda allegedly stole from their country.
   The photos were apparently leaked to the press, and Swiss
authorities have launched a judicial investigation to determine
whether their publication was illegal, according to Bern's
investigating judge, Alexander Tschaepaett.
   Markus Schneider, a Bern police spokesman, confirmed the photos
were from police files but said they had not been officially
published.
   Khashoggi's attorneys say they plan to ask Switzerland's highest
court this week for his immediate release.
   U.S. officials have said they will ask for Khashoggi's
extradition to face racketeering and other charges. A New York
court has indicted him for allegedly posing as the owner of art and
property that the Marcoses allegedly plundered from the Philippines
before Marcos was ousted as president.
   Khashoggi also was allegedly the main middleman and financier in
the Iran-Contra affair and has been involved in several kickback
scandals.
   His name also has been mentioned by Pamella Bordes, a former
call girl and researcher in Britain's Parliament whose sex and
scandal memoirs involving rich and powerful men around the world
were serialized by the London tabloid.
   One installment contained lurid tales of sexusal encounters with
Khashoggi, with a Saudi prince and with a cousin of Libya's leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi.
   In its Wednesday editions, the Swiss tabloid Blick quoted a
local government official as estimating that Khashoggi's stay in
jail costs taxpayers $55 a day, excluding meals.
   ``The billionaire has never before lived so cheaply,'' the
newspaper said.
   Swiss officials say Khashoggi receives no special treatment in
the downtown Bern jail which is reserved for people in pretrial
preventive detention.
   His cell measures 30 square feet and is furnished with a bed,
table, chair, sink and toilet. He can wear his own clothes and
order out for meals.
   His jail cell is near the luxury Schweizerhof hotel where he was
staying before his arrest. He has had some of his meals delivered
from the hotel.

   Free speech took on new dimensions outside the
Supreme Court building Wednesday as the explosive issue of abortion
rights turned a normally placid scene into a ``people's park.''
   The court's stately, marble edifice served as the backdrop for
demonstrations that led to some arrests, a crush of reporters and
television cameras recording both spontaneous and planned news
conferences, and competing rallies that spilled over to the nearby
U.S. Capitol grounds.
   Inside the courtroom, lawyers discussed in measured tones the
constitutional right to privacy and a Missouri law restricting
abortions.
   Outside the building, the arguments were less formal as more
than 200 demonstrators and onlookers milled about.
   ``Not the church, not the state, women must decide our fate,''
chanted a group of abortion rights demonstrators. They later
switched to: ``One, two, three, four. Open up the clinic doors.
Five, six, seven, eight. You can't make us procreate.''
   Far-outnumbered ``pro-life'' forces responded in kind. A group
unfurled a banner saying, ``We pray for equal justice under the law
for the babies.''
   A few feet away a cluster of black anti-abortion activists
chanted, ``Abortion is wrong. Slavery was wrong.''
   Some ``pro-choice'' protesters _ including members of a group
supporting the rights of AIDS victims _ broke through police
barricades on the building's front plaza. Twenty-seven were
arrested on charges of unlawful entry for crossing police lines.
   Their hands were bound behind them and they were led off singly
or in pairs. A few went limp and had to be dragged off.
   Activists on both sides of the abortion fight circulated among
reporters, offering their views on the potentially momentous legal
battle taking place inside.
   Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority,
said, ``I'm feeling very up.'' But she said her optimism is
tempered by the current court makeup.
   There are four new justices since the court legalized abortion
nationwide in 1973, three of them appointed by then-President
Reagan.
   ``We're very concerned about the Reagan influence on the
court,'' she said, adding that a ruling upholding the Missouri
regulations, while not banning abortions, could ``end access to
abortions for the young and the poor.''
   A stream of speakers filed to a bank of microphones on the court
plaza when the morning argument session ended.
   James Bopp, general counsel to the National Right to Life
Committee, said opponents of the Missouri law ``are seeking to
expand the right to abortion. The question is whether the court is
ready to make that right more absolute.''
   Next in line was St. Louis lawyer Frank Susman, who had just
completed his arguments opposing the Missouri regulations.
   Cutting through any legalese, Susman said he would offer ``a
sound bite'' to sum up his views that the court should reaffirm its
historic 1973 decision, Roe vs. Wade.
   ``Roe works,'' Susman said. ``You cannot put the cork back in
the bottle. You can't turn the clock back 16 years.''
   Some people arrived at the court as early as Tuesday afternoon
hoping to get one of the 40 or 50 seats inside reserved for the
general public. Hundreds had to be turned away.
   First in line was Brad Schranke of Seattle, a University of
Washington engineering student who arrived at the court at 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
   ``I believe that God is the creator and man has no right to take
a life God has created,'' Schranke said. ``The baby has to have the
choice.''
   Some 400 people _ including more than 100 journalists _ were in
the courtroom. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist foreclosed the
possibility of a larger audience, sticking to the court's
traditional policy banning television cameras or radio equipment.
   Four of the justices' wives and numerous other special guests
attended the session. In the public section sat Norma McCorvey, the
``Jane Roe'' whose legal challenge of a Texas ban on abortion led
to the 1973 landmark ruling.
   In recent years, many arguments have had a relaxed,
conversational tone. But there were few smiles among the justices
Wednesday, clearly reflecting the political stakes.
   Seven of the nine justices asked questions. Only Justices
Thurgood Marshall and Harry A. Blackmun, author of the court's 1973
ruling, remained silent throughout.
   Blackmun spent part of the time perusing a foot-high stack of
legal briefs on his desk. They included the views of a record
number of ``friend-of-the-court'' participants, tangible evidence
of the public concern generated by the case.

   The importation of millions of baseball-style
cloth caps from China does not threaten material injury to the
American headgear industry, the U.S. International Trade Commission
said Wednesday.
   The commission voted 6-0 to reject an ``antidumping'' petition
filed by the Headwear Institute of America, representing 32 U.S.
enterprises. The petition sought to establish that the Chinese caps
were being sold at an unfairly low price that threatened harm to
U.S. producers.
   If the commission had approved the petition, additional duties
of about 20 percent would have been added to the price of
Chinese-made cloth caps, hats and visors.
   The commission found that $367 million worth of the headgear
covered in the case was sold last year in the United States, half
of it imported.
   Chinese shipments last year, representing 28 percent of the
value of all such imports, amounted to 78,468,000 caps and visors
with an import cost of $51.5 million. Even more came from Taiwan,
which accounted for 31 percent of the imports, while 27 percent of
the foreign-made headgear came from South Korea.
   U.S. cap manufacturers, employing 4,895 people, are scattered
about the country, with many concentrated in Missouri, Iowa and
Kansas, the commission said.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers accompanied by tanks,
missiles and rockets paraded through Kabul on Wednesday to mark the
11th anniversary of the communist coup, but fears of guerrilla
attacks kept celebrations to a minimum.
   The parade was held a day early to avoid attacks. As it passed
through central Eidgah Square, insurgents fired a rocket into the
capital.
   Later, as the parade was ending, Moslem guerrillas who had moved
into an abandoned village about 15 miles from the capital fired on
troops along the Salang Highway, which leads from the city to the
Soviet border.
   The two sides exchanged fire for nearly eight hours, with
helicopter gunships attacking the village and soldiers firing
artillery on the mud-and-stone compounds.
   There were no reports of casualties.
   The observance of the Saur (April) Revolution that installed a
Marxist government was about one-fifth the size of last year's
parade, military officials said.
   ``We did it for security reasons. We didn't want to take any
chances,'' said one officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Many in the capital seemed aware of the observance, and the area
around the central square was sealed off.
   Hundreds of soldiers from the army, air force, special guard and
commando units as well as military training schools paraded past
the reviewing stand where President Najib and other political
leaders stood.
   The parade included dozens of freshly painted Soviet-made tanks,
rocket launchers, howitzers, rockets and long-range Scud missiles.
   Absent were diplomats from the United States, Britain, France,
West Germany, Austria and Japan. Those countries shut down their
missions in Kabul shortly before the Soviet pullout, citing concern
about the military's ability to defend the capital.
   The Moslem insurgency began soon after the April 1978 coup.
   Soviet military forces entered Afghanistan in December 1979,
replaced one Communist government with another and stayed to help
fight the U.S.- and Pakistani-backed guerrillas.
   On May 15, 1988, the Red Army began leaving Afghanistan under a
U.N.-mediated accord. The Soviets completed their withdrawal Feb.
15.
   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, returning from a visit to New
York, said Wednesday he met with the chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., Armand Hammer, during his stay in the United
States and that Hammer offered to act as a liaison between the U.S.
and Afghan governments.
   ``He, like many people, doesn't understand why this war is still
going on,'' Wakil said. ``He has offered to do what he can to
help.''

   The Lone Star Cafe, which for 12 years rode high
in the saddle billing itself as the best honky tonk north of
Abilene, faded off into the sunset (over the Hudson River) as
auctioneers sold its contents.
   The sale Tuesday was a sullen, but not necessarily sober,
occasion for some 200 former patrons, many of whom brought their
own beer to have a few final drinks at the Texas-style eatery and
watering hole.
   Much of the bidding was subdued. A set of steer horns fetched
$30 and 22 parquet tables sold for just $9 each.
   Not surprisingly, a 41-foot, 3,000-pound iguana that adorned the
Greenwich Village restaurant's roof brought the highest price.
Stewart and Lynne Anne Fisher of Glen Cove, on Long Island, bid
$17,500 for the polyurethane lizard.
   ``I bought it for my wife. It's one of a kind. It's a piece of
New York history and I'm a little crazy,'' explained an elated
Fisher.
   Minutes later, Mrs. Fisher was up on the roof hugging the
iguana. She insisted she had bought it for her husband, a
real-estate developer. Both agreed it would adorn their horse farm
near Charlottesville, Va.
   The iguana's sculptor, Bob Wade of Dallas and Santa Fe, had
hoped his friends would bid on it. But they had stepped out to buy
some beer and when they returned the iguana was sold.
   Everything was sold except for four cans of nacho cheese sauce.
The kitchen sink sold for $50.

   Midshipmen from the U.S. Naval Academy
might be heavily favored against nearby rival St. John's College in
their match-up Saturday if the contest were in football, or in
nattiness.
   But croquet is the game. Of the six annual matches between the
liberal arts college and the academy, St. John's has won four. The
trophy, called the Annapolis Cup, is displayed in neutral territory
above the bar at the Little Campus restaurant near both campuses.
   The middies plan to wear formal yachting attire with red ties
for luck. The team from St. John's College is expected to shun its
traditional tie-dye apparel in favor of sneakers and contemporary
plaid.
   The croquet match is the only competitive sporting event
scheduled between the two Annapolis schools.

   Advocates of food irradiation called on
Wednesday for widespread use of the controversial processing
technique in the United States to help prevent health risks from
infected poultry and other food.
   ``It is estimated that nearly 40 percent of the poultry sold in
this country contains deadly salmonella bacteria,'' said David
Rothbard, president of the Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, a
Washington-based group promoting food irradiation.
   Rothbard told a news conference that ``this bacteria infects
more than 2 million Americans annually and is responsible for at
least 2,000 deaths each year.''
   He said irradiation can be effective in dealing with salmonella
bacteria as well as other micro-organisms, parasites and insect
pests in food which present ``serious health risks.''
   Opponents of food irradiation contend that the process creates
new chemicals in food, some of which may be harmful.
   They have also voiced concern over potential nuclear
contamination of the environment from radioactive isotopes _
cobalt-60 and cesium-137 _ which are used in the irradiation
process.
   Rothbard noted that Maine has already adopted legislation
banning food irradiation and ``a similar bill is likely to pass the
Massachusetts and New Jersey legislatures. Many other states are
considering similar measures.''
   He said his organization was launching ``a national grass roots
program designed to educate citizens and government officials about
the benefits of this safe technology.''
   Rothbard contended that opponents of food irradiation have
relied on flawed scientific studies and used ``scare tactics'' to
block widespread use of the processing technique.
   The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow describes itself as a
newly formed non-profit group that ``promotes free-market and safe
technological solutions to various consumer and environmental
concerns.''
   Rothbard said the group's funding comes from individual
contributions, foundations and corporations, but he declined to
provide details about specific foundations and companies involved
with the effort.
   Also appearing at the news conference was Edward S. Josephson, a
biochemist representing the Council for Agricultural Science and
Technology, a non-profit organization based in Ames, Iowa,
supported by 28 professional societies involved with food and
agriculture.
   ``There is no single confirmed piece of evidence that eating
irradiated food can be harmful to health,'' he said.
   Josephson said that while food irradiation currently is being
used in the United States only to process spices, elsewhere around
the world it is being utilized with 14 foods in 20 countries
including France, Japan and the Soviet Union.
   Jason Liles, an aide to Rep. Douglas Bosco, D-Calif., said Bosco
was planning to introduce in the House within the next few days a
bill that would rescind a 1986 decision by the Food and Drug
Administration permitting sale of pork and certain vegetables that
have been irradiated.
   The legislation also would call for the National Academy of
Sciences to determine whether food irradiation is safe. Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, is planning to introduce a
companion bill in the Senate, Liles said.
   Sharin Sachs, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service, said that in fall
1987 USDA asked the FDA for clearance to propose use of irradiation
on poultry. To date, however, the department has received no
response from the FDA, she said.
   In January 1986, USDA approved the use of low-dose irradiation
on fresh pork to sexually sterilize microscopic worms, to prevent
them from multiplying within the body and causing the disease
trichinosis.
   Groups opposed to food irradiation include the San
Francisco-based Coalition to Stop Food Irradiation.
   Denis Mosgofian, the organization's director, said last July
that scientific studies showing adverse effects have been ignored
or suppressed. One study, he said, found chromosome damage in
humans four weeks after they ate freshly irradiated wheat.
   ``Irradiation of food actually changes the food, rearranges its
chemistry, creates new chemicals, many of which are toxic,''
Mosgofian said. ``Irradiated food has been shown repeatedly to
produce adverse effects to both animals and humans who consumed
it.''

   Sitting in the audience as the Supreme Court
heard arguments on abortion Wednesday was Jane Roe, a Texas
cleaning woman whose case brought the 1973 landmark Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortions.
   Roe, whose real name is Norma McCorvey, has emerged from
anonymity to enter the public fight over abortion and to argue that
the decision she won should be preserved.
   ``I'm very overwhelmed,'' she acknowledged, seeming a bit
bewildered as she met with reporters away from the hectic scene of
demonstrators outside the Supreme Court.
   McCorvey, 41, answered questions with great difficulty,
stumbling through a nine-line written statement and later questions.
   But assisted by her attorney, Gloria Allred, McCorvey disputed
suggestions she has been used in the case and said she has stepped
forward at considerable risk because she still believes in the
cause of a woman's right to an abortion.
   ``Our law is in jeopardy for all the women of the United
States,'' she said. ``... I have to protect Roe vs. Wade.''
   Allred, a feminist lawyer from Los Angeles, said McCorvey has
been in hiding in Los Angeles since April 4, when someone fired
three shotgun blasts into her Dallas home as she slept, hitting
windows and the front door.
   ``Norma feels that it is likely that the attack was made by a
person or persons who oppose the Roe vs. Wade decision and who wish
to frighten her out of speaking about the issue,'' she said. ``She
has also in the past been subjected to other forms of harassment.''
   As a result, McCorvey was accompanied by security guards who
checked credentials and searched some bags of reporters meeting
with her.
   McCorvey, as Jane Roe, said she agreed to become a test case in
the legal challenge of anti-abortion laws when she became pregnant
with a second child in 1970. She said she considered an illegal
abortion and was revolted by conditions at a visit to a back-alley
abortionist.
   But she didn't have an abortion. Instead she gave birth and put
her child up for adoption _ without knowing even its gender. Her
lawyer said McCorvey considered the experience ``far more traumatic
to her than an abortion would have been.''
   Yet McCorvey said she has recently begun efforts to locate that
adopted child, whose conception triggered the landmark case.
   Allred, who says she is not assisting in that search, insists
there's no irony or inconsistency there. ``The whole point is it's
about a woman's right to choose,'' she said.
   So what would Norma McCorvey, once Jane Roe, say to this child?
   ``Well, I obviously wouldn't discuss politics right away,'' she
said. ``I'd just say, `I'm your mom. How about a hug.'''
   Allred said McCorvey has only a modest income, cleans other
people's homes for a living, and has a 10th grade education. A
movie is being made of her life, and she is receiving money as a
consultant on the project. She has also set up a Jane Roe
Foundation, to finance her security and conduct pro-choice
activities.

   The prime minister Wednesday presented
parliament with three bills that would normalize relations between
the communist state and the Roman Catholic Church and guarantee the
church autonomy.
   Passage of the bills, expected next month, will clear the way to
establishing diplomatic relations between the Polish People's
Republic and the Vatican. The Vatican for years has refused to
grant relations until the local church's status is resolved.
   Proclaiming the start of a ``new era,'' Prime Minister
Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski introduced the package in a speech to the
460-member Sejm, or parliament, that dwelt on the long, rocky
history of church-state relations after communists came to power in
1944. The legislation was agreed to by church negotiators earlier
this month.
   To a large degree it formalizes freedoms that the church had
already won in practice for itself and the more than 90 percent of
Poland's 38 million people who consider themselves Roman Catholic.
   One bill defines the state's attitude toward the church as a
sovereign organization operating within the constitution but free
to manage all its internal affairs. A second bill grants equal
rights to all denominations, bars discrimination based on religion
and guarantees freedom of worship. The third bill entitles clergy
to state old-age pensions.
   The bills were referred to an extraordinary committee pending
the next meeting of the Sejm in May.
   ``It is a historical event,'' said Professor Stanislaw Stomma, a
Catholic lawyer and former Sejm deputy who participated in many of
the early battles with the state over church issues.
   ``The negotiations were long because of political reasons, but
now the situation is mature and it is a wise step on both sides, a
great new historical fact,'' he said in an interview with The
Associated Press.
   Rakowski told the Sejm, ``It will be up to historians ... to
determine the scope of the responsibility and the fault of the
sides which participated in the historic argument over the role of
the Catholic church in the socialist system. Today we have those
arguments behind us. We live in a different era.''
   But he implied that much of the blame rested with the
authorities. ``Generally, revolutions do not tolerate dialogue,''
Rakowski said.
   Rakowski noted that meetings between the head of the Communist
Party and the head of the Polish church were so rare in the 1970s
as to be ``sensations every time.'' But in the last eight years, he
said, First Secretary Wojciech Jaruzelski and primate Cardinal
Jozef Glemp have met 14 times. Contacts between provincial party
leaders and local bishops also have become routine, he said.
   After World War II, communist leaders abrogated the prewar
agreement giving the legal basis for church activities in Poland,
and the episcopate was forced to wage a constant battle for the
church's survival in the years that followed.
   In the Stalinist-era drive to strip the society of religion,
church properties were seized, heavy taxes were levied on parishes,
seminarians were drafted into the army, bishops faced show trials
and the unbowed primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski of Warsaw, was
held under guard in harsh conditions for three years in 1953-56.
   Unions of ``patriotic priests'' opposed to the church hierarchy
were set up, and PAX, a Catholic lay group loyal to the
authorities, was created with the right to publish religious works.
   Wyszynski was released in October 1956 as Wladyslaw Gomulka came
to power, replacing the Stalinist Boleslaw Bierut. But Gomulka
continued a cold war against the church, virtually forbidding
construction of churches and attempting to restrict the teaching of
catechism to children.

   Fighting broke out Wednesday between
groups involved in black market activities along the Cambodian
border, and Western aid officials said at least 38 people were
killed and 37 wounded.
   ``There was a big ambush on the trading route close to Ta
Phraya,'' said one official, speaking anonymously.
   Another official said a group of traders was ambushed as it
returned to the Thai district from Cambodia. ``While many of them
were running away from the gunfire, they found they were in the
middle of a minefield. They got blown up by the mines,'' he said.
   The officials said 37 of the wounded were hurt seriously.
   ``We have truckloads of wounded and we haven't seen the end
yet,'' said Urs Boegli, head of the Red Cross delegation in
Thailand. The injured were taken to a hospital at the Khao-I-Dang
refugee camp run by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
Boegli said the Red Cross recalled a third surgical team for the
crisis and had blood brought up from Bangkok.
   Officials said the casualties included Thais, but most were
Cambodians living on the other side of the border.
   It was one of the most serious clashes along the border since
the devastating 1984-85 Vietnamese offensive on the Cambodian
resistance camps.
   Other details were not available.
   Ta Phraya district is in the eastern border province of
Prachinburi and about 50 miles north of the key Thai border town of
Aranyaprathet.
   Black market trading and clashes over it are rife along the
border and involve Thais as well as Cambodian guerrillas and
refugees in guerrilla-run camps. Three Cambodian guerrilla groups
based along the frontier are fighting Vietnamese forces and troops
of the government Vietnam installed there after invading the
country 10 years ago.
   Also Wednesday, gunners continued recent attacks on Cambodian
refugee camps just inside Thailand, hitting the Site 2 camp with
heavy shells that seriously injured four refugees, a Western
official said.
   Site 2 is along the border in Prachinburi province and with
180,000 people it is the largest U.N.-aided Cambodian refugee camp
in Thailand.
   It was not clear who fired the shells, which forced the
evacuation of all but the most essential Western aid workers. The
camp is controlled by guerrillas of the Khmer People's National
Liberation Front.
   In the past, shellings of the camps escalated as the two sides
maneuvered in advance of diplomatic events.
   Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk is to hold
talks in Indonesia next week with Hun Sen, premier of the
pro-Vietnamese government.

<HEAD>Political Appointees Taking Over Some Career Civil Service Jobs</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional report shows that political
appointees are taking over mid-level federal jobs traditionally
held by career civil servants, a House subcommittee chairman said
Wednesday.
   Rep. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., chairman of the human resources
subcommittee of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service,
released a General Accounting Office report showing that 64
political appointees in 18 agencies had recently been converted to
career status.
   ``The increasing number of conversions of political appointees
into career positions is troubling, especially where ... (they)
infiltrate mid-level management positions traditionally held by
long-time civil servants,'' Sikorski said.
   Sikorski called upon the Bush administration to implement some
of the recommendations of the privately financed National
Commission on the Public Service, which has recommended among other
things a decrease in the ratio of political to career employees.
   The commission, in recommendations submitted to the president
last month, called for reducing the number of political apointees
from 3,000 to 2,000.
   The GAO said that in its survey, which covered the last quarter
of 1988, 42 agencies reported that they had not named any political
appointees to career positions.
   Eighteen agencies reported 64 such appointments, 29 of which had
actually been made earlier but not reported, said the GAO, an
investigative arm of Congress.
   Fifty-three of the appointments were made competitively and 11
were noncompetitive, according to the GAO report.
   A task force of the National Commission on the Public Service,
in a report submitted to members of Congress on Tuesday, said,
``The more of these (mid-level management) positions that are
converted to political appointments, the more civil servants are
forced to recognize that they are in dead-end career tracks.''
   In the report it submitted to the president, the commission said
federal civilian employment ``has held remarkably steady over the
past three decades, even as the number of presidential appointees
has doubled, then doubled again.''
   ``There is growing evidence ... that excessive numbers of
presidential appointees may actually undermine effective
presidential control of the executive branch,'' the commission said.

   Anti-Senegalese violence in the
Mauritanian capital has killed at least 26 people and injured 675
in the past two days, a hospital source said Wednesday. Soldiers
patrolled the streets.
   Clashes stemming from a land dispute between the West African
neighbors also have broken out in Dakar, Senegal's capital, and in
many other cities and towns.
   But there has been no reliable word on the number of casualties
outside Nouakchott.
   The roving mobs of shouting, club-wielding Mauritanians
disappeared from Nouakchott's streets Wednesday as army units
patrolled the city.
   Mauritanian officials said residents respected the 8 p.m. to 6
a.m. curfew imposed by President Maaouiya Ould Sid'Ahmed Taya and
there were no incidents overnight. It was not known when the
curfew, imposed Tuesday, would be lifted.
   Interior Minister Gibril Ould Abdallahy on Tuesday condemned the
violence and called attacks on Mauritania's Senegalese residents
unacceptable.
   A source at Nouakchott's main public hospital, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said 26 Senegalese and Mauritanians had
died and 675 were injured.
   He said others may have died or been treated for injuries at the
capital's other clinics and medical facilities.
   Other unofficial sources confirmed more than two dozen deaths
and hundreds of injured. The government said it had no casualty
report on the riots that exploded Monday and Tuesday.
   Violence has been spreading for two weeks since a border
incident set off rising tensions over competing claims by
Senegalese and Mauritanians to farm areas along the Senegal River,
which forms the border between the two nations.
   On Monday and Tuesday, angry crowds in the capital of 500,000
hunted down Senegelese citizens and beat them. Their shops and
homes were sacked and burned.
   Police broke up the rioting with tear gas and clubs.
   The Mauritanians were angered by similar treatment of their
compatriots in Senegal.
   In Dakar, 375 miles to the south, Mauritanian Ambassador Mokhtar
Ould Zamal said 100 Mauritanian men and women had been airlifted
out of the city Tuesday.
   Soliders and police using tear gas quelled anti-Mauritanian
violence in the Senegalese capital early Tuesday.
   Both countries have reinforced their troops along the Senegal
River as tensions mounted over the land dispute.
   Diplomatic observers said the clashes have shaken both
governments.
   ``Neither of these governments can be comfortable with these
events, and I'm talking about their stability,'' said one senior
diplomat on condition of anonymity.
   Both nations have tried to calm tensions since Mauritanian
soldiers allegedly killed two Senegalese farmers in Senegal's
Diawara border village April 9. At least two people have died in
violence in Senegal since then.
   Mauritania straddles Arab north and black West Africa.
Two-thirds of its 2 million people are Moors of Arab-Berber
extraction. The rest are black, mostly from the southern river
region. Nearly all of Senegal's 7 million people are black.
   The dispute concerns the right of Senegalese to farm on a
Senegal River island. After both countries became independent from
France in 1960, the black Toucouleur people of Senegal continued to
farm the Mauritanian side they had considered their own for
generations.
   Moors to the north, traditionally nomadic herders, did not farm.
   But the recent completion of two dams on the river has opened up
new farmland, spurred Mauritanian interest in agriculture and
prompted them to force Senegalese off the land.

<TEXT>
   King Hussein said Wednesday there may have
been errors in the government's economic policies, and he appealed
for unity and an end to riots over price increases.
   It was the monarch's first address to the nation since last
week's unrest, which killed nine people.
   Speaking on state-run Jordan Television, Hussein did not name a
new Cabinet to replace that of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai. Rifai
resigned Monday because of the rioting.
   The king vowed to ``take all appropriate measures'' and promised
to ``move in quick steps toward holding parliamentary elections.''
   Jordan has not had general elections since 1967, when Israel
captured the West Bank, which supplied half the deputies in
Jordan's now-suspended 60-member Parliament.
   Hussein last year severed links with the West Bank, and a new
election law calls for a 72-member legislature elected wholly from
Jordan.
   Many observers said the lack of a public voice in government fed
frustrations and contributed to the riots, during which protesters
called for Rifai's ouster and blamed him for falling living
standards.
   ``Yes, there may have been a mistake here or a mistake there as
a result of the endeavors of this official or that regarding the
priorities assigned to internal development,'' he said. ``But
someone who looks closely and fairly at these mistakes cannot
possibly see in them anything but minor forces compared with the
extent of the straits we are facing.''
   Four days of disturbances were triggered April 18 by increases
of 10 percent to 50 percent in the price of gasoline, cigarettes,
heating oil and other goods. The increases came on top of a
steadily devalued dinar, which has severely reduced living
standards.
   The rioting was the worst domestic violence in Jordan since the
army crushed Palestinian guerrillas in 1971.
   Hussein said his economic austerity program ``was painful.''
   ``But to turn to violence, destruction, burning and killing is
not a modern method of expressing discontent, and it is not a
method which we know in our country, where all channels between
citizen and official are open,'' he said.
   He noted that violence was aimed at government property ``such
as health centers, water pumps and transportation services.''
   ``Aren't we ashamed and sorry because we damaged ourselves, we
the people of a stable nation, the nation of dialogue and
development?'' he asked.
   The king noted that much of the nation's $6 billion debt was
incurred to build up Jordan's armed forces ``on the longest
confrontation strip with Israel.''
   He also alluded to the fact that other Arab states failed to
provide much of the $12.5 billion over 10 years promised at a 1978
Arab summit.
   ``Was it a mistake to support our armed forces? Or is is a
mistake to trust a brother who promised help, which is the promise
which encouraged us to borrow?'' Hussein said.

   Soviet television on Wednesday said a research
center would be built near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear
disaster, but a scientist said officials are withholding data on
atomic energy three years after the disaster.
   In Kiev, people gathered in the main soccer stadium Wednesday
night to mark the anniversary of the April 26, 1986 reactor fire
and explosion, which sent a plume of radioactive debris into the
atmosphere and killed at least 31 people.
   The mass meeting in the Ukrainian capital, 80 miles from the
nuclear plant, was entitled ``Chernobyl should not be repeated.''
   The evening news show Vremya announced that scientists worldwide
would study at the new research center near Chernobyl. It did not
say when the center would be built or specify its exact location.
   Izvestia reported Wednesday that energy authorities still
routinely censor sensitive information about the number of
accidents, fires, fatalities and pollution of the atmosphere.
   Despite President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost,
strict limits remain on what can be disclosed about the nuclear
power program, Boris Paton, president of the Ukrainian Academy of
Sciences, told the government newspaper.
   ``We cannot obtain information about atomic and conventional
energy, the number of accidents and fires at stations, breakage of
equipment which causes material damage, losses of human life and
even about the catastrophic pollution of the environment,'' he said.
   Paton said he wanted to publish excerpts of an Energy Ministry
decree in connection with the anniversary of the disaster, but the
decree carried a notice banning publication of its contents ``in
non-confidential correspondence, telegraph messages and those
materials printed in the regular press or destined to be taken
abroad.''
   Paton criticized the policy that allowed ministry officials to
determine what was secret.
   In an accompanying editorial, Izvestia called on energy
officials to end secrecy but noted: ``Unfortunately, and scientists
confirm it with conviction, it is too early to speak about full
glasnost in the field of atomic energy and the consequences of the
(Chernobyl) accident.''
   The newspaper said 116,000 people were moved from their homes in
the contaminated area and $8 billion was spent in cleanup
operations.
   ``Loss of human life, which cannot be evaluated, and loss of
faith in atomic energy are just the top layer of problems which we
all face after the tragedy,'' Izvestia said.
   A deputy to the chairman of the Ukraine Council of Ministers, E.
Kachalovsky, told Izvestia, ``there is still not enough reliable
information (about Chernobyl) and existing information is often
distorted.''
   The effects of the Chernobyl explosion are still being felt in
the region surrounding the nuclear plant, which still has four
reactors in operation.
   The weekly Moscow News said there were widespread rumors that
people living in the region of Chernobyl would be allowed to buy
individual Geiger-counters, but so far no such devices are on sale.
   ``In short, to stop all these rumors about the high rate of
radioactivity, Geiger counters should be available to everyone,''
the newspaper said.
   ``Any new project of building an atomic power station, even the
existence of old ones, raises doubts of the people,'' it said.
``Only in the conditions of total glasnost and under public control
can such tragic events like what happened in Chernobyl can be
prevented. That has to be remembered by everybody who is connected
with the atomic energy field.''
   A group of foreigners visiting Chernobyl Wednesday was told that
scientists believe the destroyed reactor is cooling down, the
television said. The report said a repaired section of the atomic
station is scheduled to resume functioning on Friday.

<HEAD>Philippine Stocks Gave World's Best Returns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An investor looking for a place to put $1,000
in 1984 might not have thought of the Manila stock market, but if
he had taken the plunge he would have found the average return on
his investment at the end of last year to be $14,880, said a study
published Wednesday.
   On U.S. markets, the average return for the four years _ the
value of the stocks themselves plus dividents _ would have been a
tame $1,910.
   Manila showed the best average return worldwide in a study by
the International Finance Corporation, which looked at stock
markets in both major money centers and 31 Third World countries.
   The corporation, owned by 133 governments, is the agency of the
World Bank that lends to private industry.
   The corporation's Charles O. Sethness said the large gain in the
value of stocks on the stocks on the Manila exchange ``was all due
to the instability until (former President Ferdinand) Marcos left.''
   The Manila exchange jogged along through 1985 without much
change, despite the violent political campaign that led to the
victory of President Corazon Aquino, but took off after Marcos flew
to exile in Hawaii in February 1986.
   By June 1987, the average return on stocks had reached a level
nearly 16 times the level of 1985.
   There was a sharp drop in Manila when markets worldwide crashed
in October 1987. But, by the end of last year, total returns were
back almost to their peak.
   Returns on stock in the Third World seem to have little to do
with a country's prosperity. According to the World Bank, the
average Filipino had an annual income of only $590 in 1987, a
slight increase after a decline of several years. The country has
an active Communist insurgency and a $30 billion debt.
   An investor in the market of relatively prosperous South Korea
would have done well, but only a little more than half as well as
in the Philippines. His $1,000 would have turned into $7,890 in the
four years.
   In the southern African republic of Zimbabwe headed by President
Robert Mogabe, a professed Marxist, the return would have been only
a little less, $7,320.
   The survey does not cover other countries where governments call
themselves socialist but are experimenting with capitalism.
Sethness said a market in Shanghai deals only in what he considers
preferred stocks, while in Budapest the trading has been largely in
bonds. He reported that the Yugoslav government has been consulting
with the corporation on the possibiity of opening a market but has
not yet done so.
   Brazil turned in the best market performance in 1988 although
the country has the Third World's largest debt and inflation was
running at more than 1,000 percent by the end of the year. The
hottest stock was Acesita, a steel company, which chalked up a
return of $8,313 for shares worth $1,000 at the start of the year.
   As in any market, investors can lose their shirts on Third World
exchanges. Stock prices were mostly down last year in southern
Europe and Africa, by 37 percent in Turkey and Venezuela and by 25
percent in Portugal.

<HEAD>Meter Maid Attacks Increase; Weapons Include Beer Bottles and Watermelon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONNI EFRON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacks on the city's meter maids more than
doubled last year, and now average about three assaults per week.
They have been punched, spit on, pelted with beer bottles and run
over.
   One angry parking violator smashed a watermelon over a ticket
writer's head.
   A popular bumper sticker reads ``Meter Maids Eat Their Young.''
   The hostility is palpable in this city where car owners feel the
Boston Tea Party led to an inalienable right to park where they
please as long as they want. The problem is compounded by office
towers that have shot up, bringing in more drivers, while the
number of legal parking spaces has stayed the same.
   But city officials are cracking down on meter maid abuse. The
134 meter maids _ 30 of whom are men and all of whom prefer to be
called ``parking enforcement officers'' _ are being trained to walk
away from irate motorists, and are told to use their walkie-talkies
to call for help. And the city is aggressively prosecuting
offenders.
   ``Slowly but surely, the word's getting out that people can't
beat up on meter maids any more,'' said Investigator Edward T.
Oliver, 34, one of eight officers assigned to protect the
ticket-writers.
   Still, Oliver's tales would discourage job applicants. On
Friday, while a meter maid was writing a ticket, the driver looked
straight at her, backed up over her foot and drove off leaving her
prone on the sidewalk, he said. A few minutes later, the suspect
came back without his car and was arrested, he said.
   ``It turned out he owed over $400 worth of parking tickets,''
Oliver said.
   He also recalled a drunk who swung a beer bottle at a meter
maid, a motorist who ran over a meter man and sent him to the
hospital, and the man with the watermelon.
   ``We had a couple of kids from a local college, after knocking a
woman to the ground and hitting her, they spat on her and left,''
he said. ``I found this woman old enough to be my mother sitting on
the sidewalk crying, with saliva dripping off her face. It was
terrible.''
   Transportation Commissioner Richard Dimino refused to allow
meter maids to be interviewed for this article because ``they've
had an awful lot of bad press'' in the past, a spokeswoman said.
   But one meter maid buttonholed while she was shooing away a
double-parked car Wednesday said she is harassed and insulted
``about 30 times a day.''
   ``Just now a guy called me a bad name,'' she said, adding that
once a man ``threatened to shoot me.''
   The woman, who refused to give her name, said more police
protection is needed.
   About 250 people have been prosecuted for verbal or physical
abuse in the last two years, and the conviction rate has been close
to 100 percent, said Robert Francis, the city's director of
municipal security.
   Francis attributed some of the increase in assaults, from 50 in
1987 to 134 in 1988, to stepped up enforcement, including
round-the-clock parking patrols begun last year.
   The statistics also may be inflated by better record-keeping and
increased reporting from meter maids, who for the first time are
seeing their tormentors punished, Francis said.
   Deputy Transportation Commissioner Rina Cutler said the number
of tickets written has increased only slightly. She blamed the
attacks on more cars fighting for the available parking spaces, a
problem that will only get worse when reconstruction of the city's
Central Artery begins.
   ``There will never be enough parking spaces in Boston for
everyone who wants to bring their car in,'' she said.

<HEAD>USS Iowa Families To Get Expedited Benefits</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government will speed up the
handling of benefit claims for the families of 47 sailors who died
in an explosion aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials said
Wednesday.
   ``The Department of Veterans Affairs and DOD have expedited the
claims from these families and also are providing assistance to
them to help them apply for the benefits,'' said Jim Holley, a
staffer with the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
   All 47 crew members who were killed April 19 when an explosion
tore through a turret during a training exercise carried the
maximum of $50,000 in life insurance available under a military
policy administered by the Veterans Department. Those checks should
be mailed within a month, said John Brizzi, counsel to the House
Veterans Affairs subcommittee on compensation, pensions and
insurance.
   It usually takes 30 to 60 days to process monthly death benefit
claims after the forms are filed by families, he said.
   ``I would expect benefits might be payable as early as June or
July,'' Brizzi said, explaining that that estimate takes into
account the time it takes the family to file for the claim in
addition to the processing. ``They'll receive a lot of assistance
here because this is an abnormal case.''
   Holley said benefit claims also were expedited when large
numbers of service personnel were killed in an airplane crash over
Newfoundland, in the bombing of Marine headquarters in Lebanon and
in the Iraqi missile attack on the USS Stark.
   Aside from the insurance payment and monthly benefit checks, the
families will receive six months' salary from the Department of
Defense. The military also will pay funeral costs.
   The families will receive educational benefits and health
coverage as well, Brizzi said.
   A private fund-raising drive sponsored by Shearson Lehman
Hutton's Norfolk office has collected more than $35,000, said Gary
Compton, a company vice president. He said the money will be
distributed to the families beginning this week.

<HEAD>South Africa Hands Over 31 Captured Guerrillas to U.N.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   South African-led security forces on
Wednesday handed over 31 captured nationalist guerrillas to U.N.
officials as part of efforts to get Namibia's independence process
back on track.
   The guerrillas were taken by U.N. and Red Cross officials from
the northern garrison town of Oshakati to Ruacana, on the border
with Angola. Later, they were to be transported to bases of the
South-West Africa People's Organization inside Angola.
   Territorial officials said four other captured guerrillas
accepted an amnesty offered by South Africa and asked to remain in
Namibia.
   The turnover of prisoners occurred a few hours before the South
African army and police units were to be confined to their bases so
guerrillas still at large could have unhindered passage across the
border into Angola.
   Radio stations, aircraft and police vehicles have been
broadcasting recorded messages from SWAPO commanders telling
guerrillas that by Wednesday evening, only U.N. forces would watch
the border.
   More than half of the 1,600 guerrillas who crossed into Namibia
earlier this month have gone back, the state-run South African
Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday. Only a dozen have appeared at
U.N.-monitored assembly points because security forces are nearby.
   About 290 guerrillas and 27 security force members were killed
in fighting after the incursion, according to police. The conflict
jeopardized the U.N. independence plan, which calls for elections
in November that SWAPO is favored to win.
   South African officials says the 60-hour safe passage period
will be SWAPO's last chance to get its fighters out of the
territory and into U.N.-monitored bases in Angola.
   The fighters may return, unarmed, in a few weeks to participate
in the U.N.-supervised election campaign. SWAPO is favored to win
the election.
   Albert Nekewaya, one of the guerrillas released Wednesday, said
he and his comrades had been ordered to enter Namibia and report to
U.N. peacekeepers.
   ``We didn't know there would be trouble ... but they (the
security forces) shot and so we shot back,'' he said. ``Our aim was
not to fight against anybody but only to give ourselves up to UNTAG
(the U.N. force).''
   SWAPO guerrillas, mostly operating from bases in Angola, have
fought since 1966 to end South Africa's 74-year rule over Namibia,
also called South-West Africa.
   Under the U.N. plan, SWAPO and South African forces were to be
confined to bases starting April 1, but there was no arrangement
for SWAPO fighters inside Namibia. The incursion prompted South
Africa to seek and receive U.N. permission to let its military
units leave their own bases to pursue the guerrillas.

   Abortion opponents led by the Bush
administration urged the Supreme Court in a long-awaited courtroom
showdown Wednesday to overturn its landmark 1973 ruling that women
have a constitutional right to end their pregnancies.
   Outside, police arrested 27 abortion-rights activists, among a
noisy crowd of people demonstrating on both sides of one of the the
nation's most divisive issues. Those arrested were charged with
crossing a police line.
   In sharp contrast, the hour-long argument session took place in
a packed but hushed courtroom.
   ``The United States asks this court to reconsider and overrule
its decision in Roe vs. Wade,'' said Harvard law professor Charles
Fried, referring to the ruling that legalized abortion.
   But Frank Susman, a St. Louis lawyer representing those who
successfully challenged an abortion-limiting Missouri law in lower
courts, argued, ``There can be no ordered liberty for women without
control over their ... childbearing.''
   Missouri Attorney General William Webster urged the court to
restore the state's abortion regulations even if it does not
reverse the broader 1973 decision, which was based on women's
privacy rights.
   Fried, a former Justice Department official called back to
government duty for Wednesday's session, argued, ``We are not
asking the court to unravel the fabric of ... privacy rights which
this court has woven. We are asking the court to pull this one
string.''
   Susman responded, ``It has always been my personal experience
that when I pull a thread my sleeve falls off. There is no
stopping. It is not a thread he is after.''
   Questioning by the justices was brisk but not as aggressive as
it has been in many argument sessions of recent years.
   Seven of the nine court members probed the positions of the
three lawyers in front of them. Only Justices Thurgood Marshall, a
strong supporter of abortion rights, and Harry A. Blackmun, author
of the 1973 decision, remained silent.
   The justices, who do not necessarily have to reconsider Roe vs.
Wade in resolving the Missouri dispute, gave little indication as
to how broad their decision will be. They are expected to announce
their ruling by July.
   At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia _ a potential ``swing
vote'' along with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M.
Kennedy _ asked whether the court must consider the nature of a
fetus.
   ``Can you derive (a fundamental right to abortion) without
making a determination as to whether the fetus is human life or
not?'' Scalia asked.
   ``It is very hard to say ... it must be a fundamental right
unless you make a determination that the organism that is destroyed
is not a human life,'' Scalia suggested.
   Susman said an assertion that ``life begins at conception,'' as
stated in the Missouri regulations, is not a verifiable fact but
``a question verifiable only by reliance upon faith.''
   Fried said the Bush administration was not asking the court to
end all protections for women whose lives might be endangered by
childbirth.
   ``We are not here suggesting that the court allow bloodthirsty
regulations,'' he said.
   When asked by O'Connor whether he thinks there is ``a
fundamental right to decide whether to have a child or not,'' Fried
said, ``I would hesitate to formulate the right in such abstract
terms.''
   Even if the court rules on the Missouri abortion regulations
narrowly, the decision will be viewed as a barometer of the current
justices' commitment to the 16-year-old ruling in Roe vs. Wade.
   The three justices appointed by former President Reagan _
O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy _ are conservatives generally
considered skeptical about the legitimacy of the earlier decision.
   The justices will take their initial vote in the Missouri case
Friday in a closed-door meeting only they attend. They will discuss
their views, beginning a process that will include drafting and
redrafting opinions.
   In an attempt to sway the justices, Americans in record numbers
have been writing and telephoning the court to express their views.
Tens of thousands of letters arrive each day, and the court's two
switchboards were so flooded with calls that a rarely used third
board had to be activated.
   The ``Roe'' of the 1973 ruling, Norma McCorvey, was in the
audience for Wednesday's arguments. The Texas cleaning woman has
emerged from anonymity to enter the public fight on the side of
abortion rights.
   In Roe vs. Wade, the court said a woman's decision to have an
abortion during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to
her and her doctor.
   The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and
may take steps to protect fetal life only in the third trimester _
24 to 28 weeks into the pregnancy when the fetus can survive
outside the womb. Recent scientific advances have called into
question some of the cutoff points in the decision.
   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down
five provisions of the Missouri law as unconstitutional:
   _A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for
performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life.
   _A ban prohibiting any public employee from performing or
assisting an abortion.
   _A ban on using tax money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus older than
19 weeks is capable of surviving outside the womb, by determining
lung maturity and other testing.
   _A declaration that the ``life of each human begins at
conception.''

improve the country's scientific and technical workforce and its
competitive status.
   The group, called CORETECH, said the nation's technological
development and commercialization efforts are threatened by an
erosion of that workforce and said training of future scientists
and engineers has been neglected.
   CORETECH recommended the following:
   _Bolster elementary and secondary math and science education.
   _Substantially increase federal support for undergraduate and
graduate education.
   _Increase the percentage of women and minorities in the
scientific and technical workforce.
   _Support and stimulate career-long continuing education
opportunities.
   _Foster collaboration among government, industrial and
educational partners.
   CORETECH has 162 corporate, university, research institute and

   Legislation to improve the transportation of
coal from mines to distant power plants through the construction of
pipelines cleared the House Interior Committee Wednesday.
   The committee approved the bill, the Coal Pipeline Act, on a
22-13 vote. It allows coal pipeline companies approved by the
interior secretary to use the federal power of eminent domain to
gain access to land so they can lay pipes.
   The technology has existed for years to use pipes to transport
coal mixed with water. The bill covers such ``slurry'' pipelines as
well as those in the future using other media, such as natural gas,
to transport coal.
   The railroad industry has opposed the legislation.
   Rep. Morris Udall, D-Ariz., who chairs the Interior Committee,
said pipelines could carry about 70 million tons of coal annually,
while total coal production each year for the next two decades is
expected to be about 275 million tons.
   ``It is difficult for me to understand how the railroads will
suffer loss of jobs when there will be at least 200 million
additional tons of coal for them to haul,'' Udall said.
   He said other countries, like the Soviet Union and Italy, have
jumped ahead of the United States by building coal pipelines, using
the technology developed here.
   ``This legislation will increase our energy security, create new
jobs, and provide much needed competition in the coal
transportation market,'' he said.
   The bill requires that the interior secretary determine that
pipeline construction is in the national interest before approving
use of eminent domain for any pipeline construction company.
   It also says construction could occur only if state water laws
and other regulations allow it.
   Udall said the major issue that has stood in the way of the bill
in the past has been whether jobs would be lost.
   An amendment added to the bill at the suggestion of Rep. Austin
Murphy, D-Pa., requires that pipelines be constructed only with
U.S. made products unless those supplies are 20 percent more
expensive than products from abroad.
   Udall, who sponsored the bill, emphasized that construction and
use of the pipeline must not damage the environment.
   The legislation has not been taken up yet by the Senate.

<HEAD>Researcher Says South African Arms Industry Relies on Pirates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Africa, which once had access to
top-line arms technology, is now dependent on pirates and arms
smugglers to update its military weaponry, the author of a new book
on the South African arms embargo said Wednesday.
   Signe Landgren of the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute said the embargo hindered, but could not stop, the growth
of South Africa's power.
   The United Nations imposed a voluntary arms embargo Aug. 7,
1963, which was made mandatory in 1977. Restrictions were further
tightened in a 1984 resolution urging countries to boycott South
African arms exports.
   The embargo was defeated for many years through cheating or
exploiting legal loopholes, said Ms. Landgren, whose book ``Embargo
Disimplemented'' was published Wednesday.
   ``All South Africa's military technology was imported from the
very same nations which took part in the embargo,'' she said at a
seminar on her book.
   ``The general conclusion can be one of a long history of
failure. That's correct if you look at each individual sale,'' she
said. ``But I see very visible effects of this embargo.''
   She cited South Africa's refusal to deploy Mirage aircraft in
Angola last year for fear of losing any to anti-aircraft missiles.
Equipment problems could have been ``a contributing factor to the
decision to withdraw from Angola and Namibia,'' she said.
   The study argues that no matter how inefficient, the embargo
remains one of the few military sanctions that can be imposed on
South Africa and is valuable as a political statement condemning
the country's apartheid system of racial segregation.
   Ms. Landgren also said that a growing interdependence in
developing new technologies and greater adherence to the embargo
are factors making Pretoria increasingly vulnerable to the
sanctions.
   ``South Africa is more and more isolated,'' she said, noting
that Israel, one of its stronger allies in recent years, had
distanced itself from Pretoria.
   ``It is left completely in the hands of private smugglers, with
all that that implies in terms of insecurity,'' said Ms. Landgren.
   In the latest example, French police last weekend broke up an
alleged plot by Protestant extremists from Northern Ireland to hand
over to a South African diplomat parts of a stolen British-made
Blowpipe shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missile.
   Last year, West German authorities uncovered an attempt to
smuggle submarine blueprints to South Africa, which has announced
plans to build its own submarine by 1992.
   Ms. Landgren estimated that buying smuggled weaponry on the
black market and pirating their design cost the South Africans
three or four times the normal price.
   As a member of the British Commonwealth, South Africa in the
1950s had state-of-the-art equipment. Britain and the United States
stopped their open sales of equipment after the first embargo.
   ``The West Europeans fell all over each other to conquer a part
of this lucrative market,'' said Ms. Landgren.
   ``After the Europeans came Japan and Israel. It is pointless to
look for one scapegoat. We are all part of the South African
market,'' she said.
   South Africa launched an arms manufacturing program by 1961, and
the embargo ``was a belated attempt to stop a development which
already had begun,'' she said.
   In the book, Ms. Landgren said the ban had the countereffect of
spurring the South Africans to further develop their arms industry.
But it also deprived Pretoria of modernized weapons systems,
restricted its access to technology and curtailed the supply of
spare parts.
   Smuggling operations are hidden by creating dummy companies,
using phony labeling, diverting shipments to new destinations at
sea or in midflight, and forging end-user certificates, the book
says.
   But legal avenues were more important for building up the
industry, it says.
   By the time the embargo took effect, South African had 120
foreign licenses to produce weapons. Before the arms ban became
obligatory 14 yeas later, the Armaments Corp. of South Africa
(Armscor) was legally producing weapons systems like the French
Mirage jetfighter and the Israeli Reshef gunboat armed with the
Scorpion sea missile.
   The embargo also is circumvented legally by importing civilian
products which have military applications, such as electronics and
telecommunications gear, the study says.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said Wednesday
it plans to offer a commercial-free daily news program for schools
that would give teachers an alternative to the ad-supported Channel
One service tested recently by Whittle Communications.
   Turner Chairman Ted Turner said his Cable News Network would
begin providing the daily 15-minute news show, called CNN Newsroom,
Aug. 14.
   The show would be carried on CNN before dawn each school day and
could be recorded for later use in the classroom. A teacher's guide
would also be available each day with tips on how to use the
programming.
   Several cable system operators, including Tele-Communications
Inc., Continental Cablevision Inc. and Jones Intercable, joined
Turner at a news conference to express support for the program and
pledged to see that schools in their areas each were equipped to
get receive the show. The three operators serve about a third of
the estimated 50 million homes with cable nationally.
   Whittle plans to provide an average of $50,000 in video
recording equipment, television monitors and satellite dishes to
each of the schools participating in the Channel One daily news
program. Turner said the decision of how much equipment to provide
schools so they can receive his program would be left up to
individual cable operators.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle is evaluating results of a
25-show test of Channel One completed last week in six schools and
hopes to decide by mid-summer whether to expand the program
nationally. The tentative date for national service is the fall of
1990.
   Whittle plans to pay for the equipment and the programming by
selling up to two minutes of commercial time in each 12-minute
show. Schools are required in exchange to run the full show for the
entire student body each day. In the test, ads were run for
shampoo, candy bars, jeans and sneakers.
   Turner said he had a last-minute change of heart on the issue of
advertising, and decided to ban it altogether after hearing
complaints from educators at a meeting that preceded the news
conference.
   Gary Marx, an official of the American Association of School
Administrators, said he told Turner that he found any kind of
advertising objectionable on a news show for schools.
   Christopher Whittle, who heads Whittle Communications and has
overseen the development of Channel One, said in a statement
following Turner's announcement that ``we wish the cable industry
the best of luck in its endeavor to bring free news and information
programming to schools.''

<TEXT>
   A senior PLO leader said Wednesday that
the Palestine Liberation Organization will accept elections in the
occupied territories only after Israeli troops withdraw and only
under international supervision.
   ``The PLO does not accept elections in the shadow of the
occupation,'' said Salah Khalaf, No. 2 to Yasser Arafat in the
PLO's largest component group, Fatah.
   The statement from Khalaf, better known as Abu Iyad, was issued
by the PLO Information Department. It was described as a
``reaction'' to a report quoting him as saying the PLO modified its
position to accept elections possibly before a complete Israeli
troop withdrawal from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Khalaf said in the statement, ``The elections must be conceived
in the framework of a plan ... which includes both an intermediary
and a definitive period allowing the Palestinian people to decide
their fate and define their independent status.''
   Khalaf said the elections must be held ``under international
supervision and after the evacuation of Israeli forces.''
   He said the plan for such elections should be defined through
consultations with the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council ``and in the framework of an international peace
conference,'' by the five members and concerned parties, including
the PLO.
   The five permanent Security Council members are the United
States, the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France.

<HEAD>Fans, Friends Say Goodbye To Lucy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For baby boomers who watched her in reruns, for
fellow comics who sought her counsel, for former presidents and
television executives still in awe of her, Wednesday was the day to
say it once more:
   ``I Love Lucy.''
   Lucille Ball, 77, died unexpectedly at Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center eight days after surgery to repair a ruptured aorta near her
heart. She was recovering well, eating, taking small walks and, of
course, joking.
   But the aorta ruptured again in a different spot and Miss Ball
died despite efforts by intensive care unit doctors and nurses at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.
   On Hollywood Boulevard's Walk of Fame, flowers were placed on
Miss Ball's star.
   Gale Gordon, who worked with Miss Ball on three television
series _ ``Here's Lucy,'' ``The Lucy Show,'' and ``Life With Lucy''
_ reflected on how many mourners Miss Ball had.
   ``I think my grief, although it is deep ... is nothing compared
to the grief her family must feel, and in her case, the entire
world,'' said Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta.
   ``Oh, what a blow! What a shame! Damn!'' lamented fellow
comedian Dick Van Dyke. ``She didn't deal in jokes. She dealt in
human behavior. She was a great physical mime with all the
instincts of a (Charlie) Chaplin.''
   Comedian George Burns, 93, said he shared the shock, and related
her death in show business terms: ``What can you do? When the guy
knocks on your door and gives you back your pictures, you gotta
go.''
   ``To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing,''
said ``Saturday Night Live'' comedian Victoria Jackson, who at 30
was born two years after the ``I Love Lucy'' show went off the air
as a regular series. ``She didn't make me laugh out loud, I
remember, she just made me happy about life.''
   ``No matter how many tears we shed today, the laughs outnumber
them. I love Lucy,'' said actress Betty White of ``Golden Girls.''
   Bob Rosati, a neighbor who stood for a few moments outside the
Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said
he was watching a rerun of ``I Love Lucy'' on Wednesday morning
when the screen went black and the words ``In Memory of Lucille
Ball, 1911-1989'' appeared.
   ``I felt I had lost someone in my family,'' said Rosati, 40.
   Television and film actor Danny DeVito recalled getting a
personal congratulation from Miss Ball in 1981 when he won an Emmy
for his work on the TV series ``Taxi.''
   ``It made it like it had been blessed,'' he recalled.
   ``Working with Lucy was like receiving an M.A. or a Ph.d. in
comedy,'' Joan Rivers recalled in a statement. ``What she forgot
about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever
learn in a lifetime.''
   Danny Thomas, whose ``Make Room for Daddy'' series was shot on
the Desilu lot, traded guest appearances with Miss Ball for decades.
   ``She was the best female clown that ever lived, no question.
... Lucy did everything _ jumping in a barrel of cement, light her
nose, eat candy off the conveyer belt.''
   Actress-comedian Jane Curtin, costar of the ``Kate and Allie''
series, said she was among the scores of comics influenced by Miss
Ball.
   ``Probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what I do, but it
couldn't be helped, because I memorized her shows,'' Ms. Curtin
said in a statement.
   ``She set a standard of television comedy for everyone to
follow,'' said ``Tonight Show'' host Johnny Carson.
   Many took comfort in preservation of Miss Ball's talent through
television reruns.
   ``God has her now and, thanks to television, we'll have her
forever,'' said comedian and longtime friend Bob Hope.
   ``Lucy is gone, but she'll always be with us,'' said Burns.
   ``All those wonderful things they did together ... those
wonderful TV shows ... are still available,'' said comic Tim Conway
in Detroit.
   ``Lucy will always have a special place in our heart, and she
will live on forever,'' former President Reagan and his wife Nancy
said in a statement.
   ``Nobody is going to take her place and nobody can compare with
her, really,'' said actor Art Carney.
   Miss Ball ``will always be the first lady of CBS,'' said CBS
chairman William Paley, who headed the network when it began
running ``I Love Lucy'' in 1951.
   Burns, ending a short meeting with reporters, said:
   ``I Love Lucy. Everybody loves Lucy.''

   Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the
western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a
century ago.
   ``It is a sad day for all of us. But I'm sure that feeling is
shared by many people around the world,'' said Nelson Garifi,
organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held
next month.
   ``She was always so full of life,'' said Pauline Lopus, who went
to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her. ``It
seemed like she would just go on forever.''
   The 77-year-old comedian died of a ruptured aorta, the main
heart artery, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where
she was recovering from emergency heart surgery last week.
   The American Heart Association's Jamestown office was deluged
with calls from Miss Ball's fans who wanted to make a memorial
donation, officials said.
   ``We just can't process as many memorials as we've received,''
said office manager Nathan Lax.
   Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in this city of 40,000 people
about 60 miles south of Buffalo, the daughter of an electrician and
a concert pianist. She grew up in nearby Celoron, a rural hamlet on
Chautauqua Lake.
   Friends said some of the characteristics of her most famous role
_ the zany, excitable star of television's ``I Love Lucy'' _ were
evident during her childhood.
   Mrs. Lopus said Miss Ball dreamed of fame, either as a dramatic
actress in New York City or as a dancing girl in musicals.
   At age 15, she worked as a barker at a local amusement park,
screaming pitches for popcorn and hot dogs until she lost her voice.
   In high school, she starred in high school plays and made her
first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace
Theater here. As a model, she caught Hollywood's eye and in 1933,
she was off to Hollywood.
   Although the comedian hadn't visited Jamestown since 1956 and
had no family there, she regularly donated money to charities,
civic events and Jamestown Community College, said Mayor Steven
Carlson.
   Miss Ball was to have received an honorary degree from the
college at the homecoming scheduled for May 20.
   Residents had hung posters saying ``Jamestown Loves Lucy'' in
storefronts and house windows.
   After she fell ill last week, residents signed the posters and
sent them to her as a get-well greeting. They sent more than 150
posters with 10,000 signatures.
   The honorary degree will be awarded posthumously, said Garifi,
who is community relations director at the college.
   Celoron had planned to rename a street in Miss Ball's honor
during her visit, and still plans to rename it as Lucy Lane, said
John Goodell of Celoron's Historical Society.
   Goodell said that when the group was formed about a year ago,
``We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she
sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.''

<TEXT>
   Officials have launched a criminal investigation
into the use of tear gas by soldiers who rushed thousands of people
demonstrating for independence in Soviet Georgia, a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said Wednesday.
   But the spokesman, Vadim Perfiliev, denied that tear gas or any
other chemical substance used by the soldiers killed anyone in the
April 9 clash in the southern republic's capital of Tbilisi.
   The denial contradicted reports by the Georgian minister of
health, Irakli Managarishvili, that at least two of the 20 victims
died from the gas and several others died from asphyxiation that
may have been induced by the unidentified substance.
   At least 1,100 people were injured in the melee, in which
soldiers charged the rally with sharpened shovels.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, in remarks carried Wednesday by
the news agency Tass, said the ruling Politburo ordered ``that
everything that happened (in the clash) be thoroughly
investigated.''
   ``But it's already clear now that we should all use political
methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything
similar,'' Gorbachev said in the closing speech at a meeting
Tuesday of the policy-setting Central Committee.
   In his first direct statement on the Georgian clash, Gorbachev
said the incident showed that party leaders must improve their
communication with the masses.
   Perfiliev told a news briefing that the investigation is being
carried out by the chief military prosecutor. ``Due to the fact
that tear gas was used on demonstrators in Tbilisi, a criminal case
has been opened,'' he said.
   He said none of the victims had died from tear gas or other
chemicals.
   ``When autopsies were performed, the reasons for death were not
the use of chemical gas or chemical substances,'' he said.
   The announcement of the inquiry came one day after the United
States denounced the use of poison gas on demonstrators and urged
the Soviets to investigate what happened during the confrontation.
   Officials in Moscow have confirmed only that tear gas was used,
but doctors treating injured protesters in Tbilisi said they were
suffering from a paralysis of the central nervous system caused by
an unidentified chemical substance.
   One of the victims, Gilo Oniani, spoke with foreign
correspondents in Tbilisi on Monday on a trip arranged by the
Foreign Ministry.
   Mrs. Oniani, a 34-year-old mother and factory worker who was
sprayed in the face with an aerosol, told reporters she was unable
to sleep due to nervous agitation and unable to eat due to pain in
her abdomen.
   Manana Gamsakhurdia, wife of jailed protest organizer Zviad
Gamsakhurdia, said in a telephone interview Wednesday night that
two men came to Mrs. Oniani's room late Monday and threatened her
for speaking to reporters.
   Perfiliev said a commission made up of scientists from Moscow,
Leningrad and other major cities had been formed and would join in
the investigation of the clashes.
   Perfiliev said the the inquiry would take some time. ``There are
contradictory versions around the events in Tbilisi,'' he said,
including the question of how many gases were used.
   On Tuesday, Givi Gumbaridze, chief of the Georgian Communist
Party, acknowledged that soldiers used a harmful gas and said
``some people died from poisoning.''
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star on Saturday identified a
chemical used against the protesters as an incapacitating agent
dubbed ``cheremukha.''
   Its main ingredient is chloroacetophenone, the newspaper said. A
Western military attache in Moscow said the substance was similar
to but stronger than tear gas.
   Demonstrations in Georgia first began April 4 when protesters
criticized calls from members of the republic's ethnic Abkhazian
minority to break away because of alleged discrimination by
Georgians.
   Other protesters have demanded Georgia secede from the Soviet
Union because of alleged interference from the central government.
   The republic's senior party official, Dzhumber Patiashvili, took
responsibility for the April 9 attack and resigned.

<HEAD>House Democrats Assail Bush MX-Midgetman Missile Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's plan to develop both
the MX and Midgetman missiles came under attack Wednesday from
House Democrats, with a handful directing their criticism at the
Armed Services Committee chairman for dealing with the White House
without their consultation.
   Lawmakers said the Pentagon proposal of $1.2 billion funding in
fiscal 1990 for the rail-based version of the multiple-warhead, MX
nuclear missile and $100 million on the single-warhead Midgetman
sounds the death knell for the latter program.
   ``It's not a two-missile package in reality. It's really a
one-missile package,'' said Rep. Les AuCoin, D-Ore., who referred
to the plan as ``a sucker deal.''
   ``If you go through with those figures you might as well kiss
the Midgetman missile good-bye,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules,
D-Mass.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney had recommended moving the
nation's 50 MX missiles from silos to deployment on railroad cars
rather than developing the Midgetman. Former President Reagan and
scores of congressional Republicans have favored the MX.
   But President Bush chose quick deployment of the MX and
research-and-development funding for the Midgetman.
   Democrats, including Senate Armed Services Chairman Sam Nunn of
Georgia and House Armed Services Chairman Les Aspin of Wisconsin,
supported the Midgetman and urged Cheney to include funding for the
missile in the Pentagon budget.
   About a dozen House Democrats met with Aspin to express their
opposition to the MX-Midgetman plan and their displeasure with his
efforts to arrange a deal without their advice.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., charged that when Aspin worked out a
deal on strategic weapons with Cheney he was not representing the
``united Democratic opinion.''
   Another Massachusetts Democrat, Rep. Edward Markey, said a
``deal of this nature should not have been cut without full
consultation of the Democrats.''
   ``We are grandstand observers,'' he said.
   Aspin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee since 1985, said
he was ``speaking for myself. I was talking for my own point of
view.''
   The Wisconsin Democrat said he sought assurances from Cheney
when the defense secretary testified Tuesday before the committee
that the Midgetman would not be ``squeezed out.''
   Aspin argued that U.S. arms control negotiators need both the MX
and Midgetman as a bargaining chip with the Soviet Union in
strategic talks, and said he made that point with his colleagues
after Frank left the meeting.
   The Massachusetts Democrat claimed the position was a brand new
one for Aspin.
   The Armed Services chairman played down the meeting, rejecting
suggestions that the session was ``cantankerous.'' Mavroules called
the session ``healthy ... there might have been some
disagreements.''
   But Frank said the meeting was ``loud'' and AuCoin indicated
that when members told the Armed Services chairman that
``consultation is different than notification,'' there was ``some
testiness on that point.''
   Frank, asked if the meeting signals a rebellion among the party,
said: ``It is not a rebellion. It is a reminder to him (Aspin) that
he was never authorized to make this kind of deal.''
   Aspin, chairman of the Armed Services Committee since 1985, was
voted out of his post in 1987 by House Democrats angered by the
Wisconsin congressman's support of the MX missile and aid to the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   He later rallied and won back his chairmanship. Frank was one of
the liberal Democrats who supported Aspin.
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., a member of the House Armed
Services Committee who attended the meeting, said those in
attendance, which included members who have worked on arms control
and Aspin's selection, were unhappy with the chairman's failure to
consult them.
   ``Nobody thought we were given a proxy for this. We were very
upset that there was arrogance that they had this deal,'' Schroeder
said.
   The Colorado Democrat, who has expressed an interest in the
chairmanship, said the ``tom toms are beating.''

   The Supreme Court is considering, in reviewing
invalidated provisions of a Missouri law, whether to alter its 1973
ruling in Roe vs. Wade that women have a constitutional right to
abortion.
   In 1973, the court said a woman's decision to have an abortion
during the first three months of pregnancy must be left to her and
her doctor.
   The court said states may interfere in the abortion decision
during the second trimester only to protect the woman's health, and
may take steps to protect fetal life in the third trimester only
when the fetus can survive outside the womb. The court said that
occurs sometime between 24 and 28 weeks.
   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck down
these provisions of the Missouri law as unconstitutional:
   _A ban on the use of public hospitals or other facilities for
performing abortions not necessary to save a woman's life and a ban
prohibiting any public employee from performing or assisting an
abortion.
   _A ban on using tax money for ``encouraging or counseling''
women to have abortions.
   _A requirement that doctors determine whether a fetus thought to
be at least 20 weeks old weeks is capable of surviving outside the
womb, by testing for weight, gestational maturity and lung capacity.
   _A declaration that the ``life of each human begins at
conception.''
   In arguments Wednesday, the Bush administration's lawyer,
Harvard law professor Charles Fried, focused on the 1973 decision
while Missouri Attorney General William Webster emphasized the
state law's provisions.
   St. Louis lawyer Frank Susman, representing opponents of the
Missouri law, urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling.
   Fried said: ``The United States asks this court to reconsider
and overrule its decision in Roe vs. Wade.''
   Webster said: ``States have effectively been forbidden, not only
to prohibit abortion, but usually to regulate abortion in any
significant way. ... We contend that the government is certainly
not obligated ... to become an advocate for abortion.''
   Susman said: ``There can be no ordered liberty for women without
control over their ... childbearing.''

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega called
the political opposition in Panama traitors on Wednesday.
   Noriega, head of the Defense Forces and as such de facto leader
of Panama, is not running for president in May 7 elections, but is
actively campaigning for the government coalition.
   While talking to hundreds of local leaders Wednesday, Noriega
quoted an article in U.S. News &amp; World Report as saying the U.S.
government is spending $10 million to help the opposition in the
Panamanian elections.
   The story, appearing in this week's edition of the
Washington-based weekly newsmagazine, said President Bush ordered
the expenditure. U.S. officials have declined comment.
   Noriega said accepting the money amounts to ``betrayal by the
unpatriotic Panamanians.''
   The official news agency Panapress said Wednesday the $10
million is part of a $120 million program the U.S. government has
promised to the opposition.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara has denied
the reports of U.S. financing.
   ``We have not asked for, nor received, nor will we ever receive
any money from foreigners in the United States or any other
power,'' Endara said.
   According to Noriega, ``Now none of them (opposition) can say
that they haven't received $10 million. We don't know to whom they
gave it, but we know they have it.''
   Noriega said in answering a reporter's question that differences
with the United States are ``no more than the reincarnation of
provocations since we signed that wretched treaty'' for the Panama
Canal in 1904.
   Noriega pressed Panamanians not to retreat from the 1977
agreement with the United States under which control of the
waterway reverts to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   ``Not one step back,'' the general declared.
   He insists that problems with the United States are based on
U.S. plans to break that treaty and refuse to turn over the canal.
   U.S.-Panamanian relations have been poor since February 1988,
when Noriega orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo
Delvalle. The United States still recognizes Delvalle as Panama's
head of state.
   Delvalle had tried to fire Noriega after a federal grand jury in
Florida indicted him on drug smuggling and money laundering
charges. Noriega denied the charges.
   American election observers have announced their intention to
watch the Panamanian balloting, but Panama has complained about
their presence.

   A package of federal relief measures to help
farmers in Kansas and other states recover from the current dry
spell that has gripped parts of the nation's midsection was
announced Wednesday by Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   ``Rain is what these states need, but I can't guarantee that,''
Yeutter said. ``However, I trust the assistance we are able to
provide will help.''
   The assistance included permission for qualified farmers to
graze livestock and cut hay on land taken from production under
conservation portions of this year's crop programs.
   Livestock and poultry producers also will be able to buy surplus
grain owned by the department's Commodity Credit Corp. at half
price. In a related program, CCC will help pay feed cost for
farmers who must purchase more than usual amounts of feed for
livestock.
   Yeutter said he had directed the Agricultural Stabilization and
Conservation Service to respond within 24 hours to requests from
the agency's state offices for drought aid.
   Kelly Shipp, Yeutter's press secretary, said the aid package is
essentially the same as USDA made available in the 1988 drought,
which spread by summer throughout most of the nation and cut last
year's harvests sharply.
   Asked if there were significant changes from what was offered
last year, Shipp said, ``Not really, it's pretty straightforward.''
   Shipp said that while Kansas is expected to benefit greatly from
the emergency assistance, farmers in a number of other states are
expected to be eligible, including Iowa, Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Texas. Others are expected to qualify, too, she said.
   Yeutter also announced that a 1989 USDA drought task force has
been established, headed by Undersecretary Richard T. Crowder, who
oversees international affairs and commodity programs.
   The action followed Yeutter's visit April 14 to the hard-hit
winter wheat drought area, with Sens. Robert Dole and Nancy
Kassebaum, Rep. Pat Roberts, Kansas Republicans, and Gov. Mike
Hayden.
   On Capitol Hill, meanwhile, USDA's chief meteorologist, Norton
Strommen, told members of Congress that except in the central Great
Plains, the weather outlook for crops has improved greatly.
   ``Conditions are much more encouraging than in 1988,'' Strommen
said.
   But he said the damage from a February freeze and lack of spring
rain has caused irreversible damage to a large part of the winter
wheat crop in the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles, west Kansas and
southern Nebraska.
   Strommen said he expects a more normal distribution of summer
rainfall and a weather pattern favorable to the spring planting
that is beginning.

<HEAD>Panel Backs Bill To Overturn Restrictive Policy On Soviet Refugees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House panel on Wednesday endorsed
legislation that would ease the way for Soviet Jews and
Pentecostalists seeking refugee status in the United States.
   The legislation seeks to undo a change in Justice Department
policy last summer that substituted case-by-case review for the
previous practice of allowing into the United States all Soviet
Jews and evangelical Christians on the grounds they were suffering
from religious persecution.
   The bill's author, Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., said he hoped
the Bush administration would act on its own to undo the action of
then-Attorney General Edwin K. Meese III.
   But, if Attorney General Dick Thornburgh doesn't act, Morrison
said, ``We'll push the bill through.'' The committee approved the
legislation on a 5-4 vote.
   The legislation states that both Jews and Pentecostalists have
been persecuted by the Soviet government and should be granted
refugee status automatically.
   The bill, which would be valid for only 17 months, to give time
for a longer-term solution to be devised, would also grant
automatic refugee status to residents of Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia
wishing to enter the United States.
   Meese restricted the refugee flow to deal with a growing flood
of Soviet Jews, Armenians and Pentecostalists taking advantage of
the Kremlin's liberalized emigration policies.
   Morrison, chairman of the House subcommittee on immigration,
refugees and judicial reform, called Meese's decision ``an
overkill'' that placed unnecessary hardships on thousands of Soviet
citizens wanting to come to the United States.
   About 5,000 of an estimated 30,000 Soviets who have applied
since Oct. 1 for refugee status have been turned down. The
rejections, as well as an unprecedented number of applicants, have
created a backlog of more than 20,000 Soviets waiting to enter the
United States.
   To counter the growing backlog and respond to the increasing
number of applicants, Thornburgh proposed legislation earlier this
month that would allow the administration to admit 30,000 people as
special immigrants to the United States every year.
   Jewish groups contend Thornburgh's proposal would absolve the
administration of having to pay for the Soviets' resettlement _ as
must be done for refugees _ and would send a signal to the Soviet
leadership that the United States now accepts Soviet human rights
policy.
   ``We have people suffering, waiting in Moscow and wondering if
Gorbachev is going to change his mind,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. He said the matter was ``obviously not a high priority for
the administration.''
   But Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, one of four Republicans to vote
against the bill, argued that the administration was nearing the
start of consultations with Congress on raising the ceiling of
refugees allowed into the country.
   The administration has been saying since February that it would
ask Congress for additional refugee slots beyond the 94,000
approved for this fiscal year to take care of some of the Soviet
overflow.

<HEAD>FCC Rules on Murdoch's Ownership of Boston Newspaper, TV Station</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday granted media executive Rupert Murdoch's request to
transfer his Boston TV station to a trust in order to comply with
FCC rules barring ownership of a broadcast station and newspaper in
the same city.
   The FCC, in a 3-0 vote, said Murdoch's Twentieth Holdings Corp.
could turn over UHF station WFXT in Boston, where Murdoch's News
America Publishing owns the Boston Herald, to trustees Edward W.
Brooke, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and Hugh L.
Carey, the former New York governor.
   But the commission said that in order to assure the station was
properly ``insulated'' from Murdoch and his affiliate companies,
which include the 20th Century Fox film and TV operations,
Twentieth Holdings could not have approval of any possible sale of
the station.
   The commission also said the station could have ``no
communications'' _ that is, it could not use _ Fox programming or
be an affiliate of the Fox TV network of stations.
   At the same time, the commission denied two competing
applications for the license of WFXT.
   The commission said its no-communications standard for broadcast
trusts ``was well established when Twentieth bought the station (in
1986) and that any communication between the trustees and any
Twentieth affiliate, no matter how limited, is prohibited.''
   However, the commission allowed the station to use syndicated
programs for which it previously had contracted until the existing
contracts expire.
   ``This action, as a practical matter, will end the station's
ability to remain a Fox affiliate and to acquire programming from
Fox on an on-going basis,'' the commission said.
   FCC Chairman Dennis R. Patrick called the provision barring
continued affiliation ``a harsh result,'' but said precedent was
well established regarding the overall provisions of trust
transfers.
   Twentieth Holdings has 60 days to comply. It also could ask the
FCC to reconsider, appeal to the courts or ask for a commission
hearing on the conditions. Or it could divest the property.
   Attorneys for Murdoch did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
   Under terms of the transfer, Murdoch will relinquish control but
still receive any profits. The trust will expire if WFXT shares are
sold, if the station stops operations or if the Boston Herald is
sold. If the station is sold, the trustees must try to sell the
shares to one buyer and the price must exceed $35 million.
   The station has been valued at between $30 million and $50
million.
   Murdoch engaged in a bitter battle with Congress in 1987 over
his ownership of the two Boston media outlets, as well as his
ownership of the New York Post and WNYW-TV in New York.
   Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., had
pushed a measure through Congress late in 1987 prohibiting the FCC
from eliminating or modifying the cross-ownership rules and barring
it from extending any waivers to the rules.
   The Herald at the time, which had been editorializing against
Kennedy, called his congressional action ``a vendetta.''
   The FCC had given Murdoch a waiver allowing him to own both
Boston outlets until June 30, 1988.
   A federal appeals court overturned the congressional action, but
Murdoch decided to seek FCC permission to transfer the station to
the trust. The FCC gave him another extension while it considered
the request.
   Murdoch, through his Australian-based News Corp., owns extensive
newspaper holdings in Europe, North America and Australia.

   Here is a brief look at some of the comments
made Wednesday during Supreme Court arguments in a case in which
the justices are being asked to overturn the court's 1973 decision
that said women have a constitutional right to abortion.
   ``First, we are not asking the court to unravel the fabric of
unenumerated and privacy rights which this court has woven in
(previous) cases.... Rather we are asking the court to pull this
one thread,'' said Charles Fried, for the Bush administration.
   Frank Susman, for those who challenged the Missouri law,
disagreed, saying: ``... he (Fried) does not seek to unravel the
whole cloth of procreational rights but merely to pull a thread. It
has always been my personal experience that when I pull a thread my
sleeve falls off. There is no stopping. It is not a thread he is
after. It is the full range of procreational rights and choices
that constitute the fundamental right that has been recognized by
this court.''
</TEXT>
<NOTE>___</NOTE>

   Susman said: ``I think the basic question ... whether this is a
human life or whether human life begins at conception, is not
something that is verifiable as a fact. .... Both sides would agree
as to when a heartbeat can first be detected. Both sides would
agree as to when brain waves can first be detected. But when you
try to place the emotional labels on what you call that collection
of physiological facts, that is where people part company.''

<TEXT>
   Two of Britain's leading food manufacturers
offered a $170,000 reward Wednesday for information leading to
blackmailers who have put glass shards, pieces of razor blades,
thumbtacks and caustic soda in baby food.
   H.J. Heinz Co. Ltd. and Cow and Gate Ltd. offered the joint
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the
culprits. The companies said they received blackmail demands but
would not elaborate.
   Since April 7, 28 incidents of tampering involving baby food
have been reported, including 11 on Wednesday, the government said.
At least three people have suffered minor injuries.
   Scotland Yard said it was coordinating a nationwide police
inquiry.
   ``It is difficult to imagine the twisted minds that could mount
such a vicious attack on defenseless babies,'' Home Office Minister
John Patten told the House of Commons. He said the government
pledged to resist ``all attempts at consumer terrorism.''
   The victims so far are a 9-month-old girl in Oxford, who cut her
mouth on a piece of razor blade, and two mothers cut by glass
hidden in jars of infant food. None required hospital treatment.
   In one incident, sodium hydroxide, or caustic soda, was used to
spike a jar of baby food. The white substance is a strong caustic
base used in chemistry and oil refining.
   London's Daily Mail reported Wednesday that blackmailers
apparently were trying to extort money from supermarkets and food
companies. It said several major supermarket chains had received
threats.
   Heinz, whose parent company is the Pittsburgh-based food giant,
and Cow and Gate said internal investigations determined their
products were not tampered with during production. They said they
would not submit to blackmail.
   Patten told Parliament there were no signs the baby food had
been infected during the manufacturing process and that police had
``considerable evidence of contamination at a later stage.''
   Heinz warned parents to be vigilant when feeding their children
and said it shared parents' ``sense of outrage that a tamperer is
prepared to target a victim as precious and vulnerable as a baby.''
   It said stocks were removed from shelves and replaced in all
incidents where tampered products were found.
   Ted Smyth, director of corporate affairs for H.J. Heinz Corp. in
Pittsburgh, said the parent company ``shares the universal
outrage'' over the tampering.
   He said in reply to a question, ``We have no reason at all to be
concerned about tampering of products in the United States.'' Smyth
said the cases were limited to Britain.
   A supermarket in the northwest city of Blackpool removed all
Heinz products after a jar of baby food was found to contain
slivers of glass, and other supermarkets said they were considering
withdrawing all Heinz and Cow and Gate products.
   Spiked jars were first found in London and the central cities of
Bedford and Leicester, but more cases have since been reported
across southern and western England.
   In Bradford-on-Avon, Diana Tyndall said she cut her lip on a
piece of glass as she tasted a jar of fruit dessert she was about
to feed her 6-month-old daughter.
   In Luton, a mother who had heard news reports of the tampering
said she cut her finger while checking a jar of egg custard
intended for her 7-month-old daughter.
   ``As I took the second spoonful out it hit something in the
food,'' said Susan Hunt, 24. ``I put my finger in to see what it
was and a piece of glass cut me.
   ``I think they are out of their minds doing this,'' she said.
``At the moment my baby could be in hospital because of them. It is
murderous. I am going to feed her on packet food from now on.''

   President Bush mourned Lucille Ball's death
on Wednesday, saying that the loss was ``immeasurable'' but ``so is
her legacy of laughter.''
   ``Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter. But she also
embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love,'' Bush said
in a statement. ``She appealed to the gentler impulses of the human
spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She was Lucy
and she was loved.''
   Bush, who telephoned Miss Ball's husband, Gary Morton, to
express his condolences, said the family's loss ``is immeasurable.''
   ``But so is her legacy of laughter. It is timeless, it spans the
generations. No television program in history was better named than
`I Love Lucy.' Mrs. Bush joins me in mourning the death of this
legendary figure. We, too, loved Lucy. So did the world.''

<HEAD>U.N. Official Says Emergency Food Program Will Miss Target</HEAD>

<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An emergency food program for war-plagued
southern Sudan will move less than half the needed grain before
rains cut off outlying villages, a U.N. official said Wednesday.
   Relief workers began the $132-million U.N. operation April 1
with the intention of shipping 115,500 tons of food to locations
around the southern Sudan by mid-May. The rainy season begins then,
isolating villages and making roads and airstrips unusable.
   However, James P. Grant, the director of Operation Lifeline
Sudan, said Wednesday that only 37,000 tons of food had been
delivered and 10,000 more tons would be distributed in the next 10
days or so.
   He acknowledged that the program would not meet its goal of
moving 115,500 tons of food by mid-May.
   ``We clearly are going to fall short of that target, but we
certainly will get more tonnage in,'' Grant told reporters after
returning from inspecting the program's progress.
   ``In short, everything is moving, but also everything is moving
slower than we would have hoped,'' he said.
   Operation Lifeline Sudan is seeking to stave off up to 100,000
anticipated deaths from starvation. Last year, as many as 500,000
Sudanese died because of famine caused by floodings and civil war.
   Grant said delivery of food will go on through the rainy season,
but much of the grain will have to be stored at central
distribution points. He said hunger will drive many remote
villagers to the storage sites, compounding the problems of a
population displaced by the fighting.
   The Sudan Peoples Liberation Army has been fighting the central
government since 1983. The Christian and animist rebels want
greater autonomy from the Moslem-controlled government in Khartoum.
   Among the difficulties Operation Lifeline Sudan has encountered
are attacks on a convoy by tribesmen, a railroad strike, and
Ethiopia's refusal to allow shipments of food on its roads
bordering Sudan.
   Grain deliveries are now being divided about equally between
rebel-held and government-controlled areas, Grant said. He said
both sides have agreed to let food convoys, trains, barges and
airlifts pass through designated ``corridors of peace.''
   UNICEF, which Grant directs, is coordinating the relief effort
with the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International
Committee of the Red Cross, governments, and private agencies.

   Hundreds of rival soccer fans
battled each other and attacked police Wednesday during riots on
the day of the Netherlands-West Germany World Cup qualifier. At
least 23 people were reported injured.
   Fans also rampaged downtown before the game, hurling bricks at
police and smashing windows.
   Police said they arrested 40 fans, mostly during fights outside
the Feyenoord Stadium while the two teams were playing inside,
according to police spokeswoman Ellen Peeters. She said rival fans
attacked each other and battled police who intervened.
   About 1,500 fans were involved in that disorder, police said.
   Authorities deployed 600 officers, including 250 riot police,
during the match for fear of a repeat of the stadium disaster in
Sheffield, Britain, on April 15, when 95 people were killed in the
crush of the crowd.
   Dutch fans had threatened to storm the 57,000-capacity stadium
on Wednesday unless more tickets became available for the sold-out
game. Some people believe such a stampede is what caused the deaths
in Sheffield.
   Earlier Wednesday, police battled about 500 fans, some of whom
hurled bricks and wooden sticks, in a downtown shopping
neighborhood, police said. They said the rioters also looted a toy
store and smashed dozens of shop windows.
   Police on horseback and riot officers with batons broke up the
crowds. In one case, a police helicopter dived to within about 30
feet of a group of marauding youngsters.
   Dutch television said 40 people were injured, including three
policemen. The discrepancy with police figures could not be
resolved immediately.
   Wednesday's game ended in a 1-1 tie.
   After least year's European championship semifinal against West
Germany, Dutch fans cheered their country's 2-1 victory with street
revelry and open hostility toward the Germans. Some saw the win as
revenge for Nazi Germany's occupation of the Netherlands in World
War II.

<TEXT>
   About 400 to 450 people rallied Wednesday
at the state Capitol to protest Chippewa Indian treaty rights that
allow them to spearfish off their reservations before anyone else
is allowed to fish.
   While protesters gathered outside, more than a dozen business
people from northern Wisconsin urged state officials to do act on
the spearfishing issue before the annual spring ritual permanentlu
damages the tourism industry.
   ``Northern Wisconsin, be it just or not, is perceived as a
fishless and a raciallly bigoted vacation land,'' said John
Sprister, a resort owner. ``You've got our lives in your hands.
Don't drag this thing out.''
   The protesters object to the Chippewa being allowed to leave
their reservations and spear walleyed pike, muskellunge and other
trophy-sized fish on public lakes before rod-and-reel season begins.
   The Indians' spearing season began Sunday and on Tuesday one
band was met at lakes by hundreds of protesters, three of whom were
arrested Tuesday.
   The Indians' treaty rights on fishing, hunting and gathering
food plants were upheld in 1983 by a federal court.
   The businesssmen said they did not doubt the sincerity of
Attorney General Don Hanaway and Gov. Tommy G. Thompson in trying
to negotiate a settlement with the Chippewa, but that the public
did not realize what they were doing.
   ``I'm sure you people are working night and day on this, but the
perception is that nothing is being done,'' campground owner Al
Vehrs said.
   ``The efforts are not in question here. It's the results of
those efforts that we're not satisfied with,'' said Jim Galloway,
president of the Boulder Junction Chamber of Commerce.
   The 1983 ruling on the tribe's fishing rights came in a suit
filed on behalf of the tribe 15 years ago. Parts of the suit, on
such issues as timber rights, are still unresolved.
   Hanaway said public officials need the help of business leaders
to convince the people of northern Wisconsin that the case would
take an additional five or six years to resolve in court, and that
a negotiated settlement is the only way to quickly resolve the
issue.
   Tribal members are expected to spear only about 30,000 fish this
spring, compared with an annual hook-and-line walleye catch of
about 800,000 fish annually in northern Wisconsin.
   Hanaway also said northern Wisconsin was being falsely labelled
as a racist area because of the protests against spearfishing.
``The fact is that there is racism, but it's by a very, very tiny
minority,'' he said.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 1983 that the
rights the Chippewa retained to hunt, fish and gather on public
lands off their reservations in roughly the northern third of the
state had not been extinguished by later treaties or other federal
actions.
   Since then, U.S. District Court rulings have defined broad
treaty rights for the state's roughly 18,000 Chippewa Indians,
including the right to a ``modest'' standard of living from fish,
game and timber on public lands.

   James Richardson tearfully thanked
God, his attorneys and the governor Wednesday on his first full day
of freedom after spending 21 years behind bars in the poisoning
deaths of his seven children.
   ``Free at last, free at last. Thank God almighty, I'm free at
last,'' Richardson said, borrowing the phrases that were
immortalized by civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.
   A judged ruled late Tuesday in Arcadia, the southwest Florida
town where the children died, that the former orange picket's 1968
trial on a charge of murder was tainted by prosecutorial misconduct
and perjured testimony.
   Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly, assigned to review the case
by the state Supreme Court, released Richardson to the custody of
Miami attorney Ellis Rubin.
   Richardson, 53, started his day with a stroll on the beach near
the state prison where he spent much of his confinement, which
included a harrowing stay on death row.
   ``It's a pleasure to walk on the beach, see the sunlight,
picking up sand and dirt, kicking my feet in the water. I've never
felt that in 21 years,'' he said.
   Richardson's wife, Annie Mae, called her husband's release ``a
miracle from God.''
   Former comedian Dick Gregory has offered Richardson a 10-year
contract to work for him at his Fort Walton Beach nutrition center,
and discussions are under way for a feature-length movie on
Richardson's ordeal.
   Richardson described the horror of being on death watch, having
his body shaved and watching his coffin being built before his
sentence was commuted in 1972, when the U.S. Supreme Court struck
down the nation's death penalty statutes.
   ``You can almost taste the sense of death on your tongue,'' he
said.
   He said he thought he was going to die during heart surgery 18
months ago. But Richardson said he feels no bitterness toward those
who put him on death row: ``I don't have no hate in my heart.''
   The state has 10 days to order a retrial, but attorney Mark
Lane, whose 1971 book ``Arcadia'' claimed Richardson was framed,
predicted the case will be closed.
   Gov. Bob Martinez issued an executive order that leaves the
final determination about a new trial to Janet Reno, the special
prosecutor he appointed to review the case.
   The governor also encouraged Ms. Reno to continue her
investigation into the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of
officials involved in the prosecution.
   Rubin and Lane accused former State Attorney Frank Schaub of
using manufactured testimony to railroad their black client in the
trial before an all-white jury.
   Schaub denies there was anything improper in the trial and has
filed a defamation-of-character suit against the two attorneys.
Schaub accused Lane and Rubin of orchestrating Richardson's release
to feed ``the ever increasing demand for fictionalized stories from
the news and closely allied entertainment industries.''
   Reno told Kelly: ``James Richardson did not receive a fair
trial.'' Key evidence was withheld ``that could have changed the
outcome,'' she said.
   Richardson's lawyers and the special prosecutor presented
testimony pointing to baby sitter Betsy Reese as a prime suspect.
   Ms. Reese, 67, is in an Arcadia nursing home suffering from
Alzheimer's disease. Two nurses filed affidavits last year that she
confessed several years ago to poisoning the children, ranging in
age from 2 to 8.
   The children died Oct. 25, 1967, hours after eating a lunch
tainted with insecticide. Richardson and his wife were working in a
citrus grove eight miles away when the baby sitter served the lunch.

<HEAD>More Than 200 Excavated From Mass Grave</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

   Authorities excavated the bodies of more than 200
people who had been shot during Josef Stalin's rule and buried in a
mass grave outside Kiev, the official news agency Tass reported
Wednesday.
   Tass, quoting from a report in the weekly Literaturnaya Gazeta,
said the bodies of foreigners were among those found during four
days of excavation at a site in the Darnitsa Forest. It did give
the exact days for the excavation.
   The government has estimated the site contains from 6,000 to
68,000 bodies, but unofficial estimates said bodies of up to
300,000 people were stacked in the grave.
   A government commission in March found that the bodies buried at
the site were those of victims killed under Stalin's repressions,
not by Nazi soldiers, as three previous official inquiries had
ruled.
   The commission's conclusion in March supported testimony of
elderly witnesses in the nearby village of Bykovnia, who said they
saw trucks that dripped blood rumbling to area in the 1930s, before
the Nazis occupied the area.
   ``The personal belongings found in the mass graves will
undoubtedly help clear up the Bykovnia case,'' said Tass, quoting
the newspaper.
   Tass said gunshots pierced many of the skulls.
   It said the grave also contained servicemen and civilians from
other countries, citing evidence of foreign uniforms, footwear and
toothbrushes.
   Earlier commissions on Bykovnia had blamed the Nazis for the
killings even though villagers insisted the bodies were already
there when the Germans occupied Kiev in September 1941.
   The report blamed ``several generations of bureaucrats in Kiev''
with covering up ``Stalinist crimes'' at the site.
   The villagers broke five decades of terrified silence to accuse
Josef Stalin's secret police of the killings after the Ukrainian
government erected a monument in May 1988 blaming Nazi occupiers
for the crime. The villagers forced Ukrainian authorities in
December to establish the commission.
   Western historians estimate 20 million Soviets were killed under
Stalin, particularly during the Great Purge of the late 1930s, but
Soviet officials ignored the dark side of Stalin for most of the
past 50 years.
   The examination of Stalin's crimes begun briefly under Nikita S.
Khrushchev and was revived in 1987 under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness.
   Western historians also blame the Soviets for the massacre of
4,250 Polish officers unearthed in 1943 in a mass grave 310 miles
away in the Katyn Forest. Earlier this year, Polish authorities
said Stalin's forces killed the officials, although official Soviet
commissions have blamed the Nazis.
   A joint Polish-Soviet commission is examining Katyn and other
``blank spots'' in Soviet history.

Amendment</HEAD>

   House Democratic leaders pulled a $4.7 billion
spending bill off the floor Wednesday after rebellious lawmakers
rejected a plan to cut $1 billion from the Pentagon budget to
strengthen the war on drugs and finance other domestic programs.
   House Speaker Jim Wright of Texas, responding to defeat in the
first budget test of the year, pledged ``corrective surgery'' that
would satisfy disgruntled Democrats and Republicans.
   Leaders wanted to pay for the spending in the bill by curtailing
defense, foreign aid and many domestic programs by $1.4 billion.
But the effort failed when minority Republicans were joined by
Democrats seeking to protect their favorite programs from
across-the-board cuts.
   House Majority Leader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who offered the
spending-cut amendment, said the vote was a sign of the
divisiveness of budget issues and not a signal that the Democratic
leadership was weakened by the controversy surrounding Wright and
his personal finances.
   ``I don't think it reflects on leadership problems,'' Foley
said. ``This is not a vote of confidence issue.''
   One of the 92 Democrats who voted against their leaders' plan
was Rep. Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House Science, Space
and Technology Committee. Roe said he opposed the across-the-board
cuts because they would have sliced too deeply into the programs he
oversees.
   ``From our point of view, we were battling the loss of about
$100 million from science and space,'' he said.
   Foley's proposal would have produced $1.4 billion in savings by
shaving .57 percent off most government programs. The provision
would have produced cuts this year of $1 billion in defense, $353
million in domestic programs and $43 million in foreign aid.
   White House budget director Richard Darman had sent lawmakers a
policy statement in which he said he would urge President Bush to
veto the ``fiscally irresponsible'' measure.
   And in a letter to House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the defense cuts would force the
Pentagon to stop paying re-enlistment bonuses, reduce training
hours, eliminate five to 10 construction projects, lay off
scientists and engineers and curtail weapons testing.
   ``This would have very serious consequences for the manning of
our forces,'' he wrote, adding that he, too, would seek a veto.
   But loyal Democrats countered that the spending cuts were slight
and could be dealt with by federal agencies.
   ``All we're talking about are revisions of .57 percent so we can
cover some of the priorities we in Congress think are needed,''
said Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa.
   Looming over the battle was the veto threat from the Bush
administration, which labeled the overall bill ``fiscally
irresponsible'' and said the Democrats' proposed $1 billion in
defense cuts would be too harsh.
   The legislation, deemed a ``dire emergency'' by its supporters,
would provide money for the 1989 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
Included would be $1.2 billion for veterans programs, $892 million
for guaranteed student loans, $822 million for anti-drug efforts,
$600 million for last year's forest fire costs.
   Republicans complained that the legislation would leave spending
levels well above limits agreed to in a 1987 budget pact between
Congress and then-President Reagan. They also said it would push
this year's deficit even further beyond the $135 billion limit set
in the budget. The 1989 shortfall is expected to surpass $163
billion, without counting this measure.
   ``If a satirist wanted a perfect lampoon about how the Congress
of the United States makes economic policy, if a cartoonist was
looking for the biggest blubbering whale in the ocean to harpoon,
if he wanted a model of a turkey, they need to look no further''
than this bill, said Rep. Silvio Conte, R-Mass.
   The legislation was endowed with symbolic importance because of
the recently concluded agreement between Bush and congressional
leaders on next year's budget.
   Republicans argued that with work on 1990 deficit reduction just
beginning, it looked bad for Congress to begin its work this year
by boosting the 1989 shortfall. The ranking Republican on the House
Budget Committee, Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, called the
legislation ``the moral equivalent of banana republic fiscal
policy.''
   Democrats used some of the bill's spending _ such as its funds
for new prisons, training for new law officers and other anti-drug
measures _ as a test of Bush's willingness to pursue initiatives he
has endorsed.
   ``If you're serious about dealing with the drug problem in this
country, you'll vote yes,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., the
deputy House whip.
   But Republicans argued that the drug expenditures, and other
parts of the bill, could have waited until next year.
   ``It makes a good show, great charade, `I'm for drug abatement
and against abuse and all of that sort of thing,''' said Michel.
``But I tell you folks, they've got more money now than they can
spend.''
   The $4.7 billion measure would also provide $423 million for
state foster care programs, $250 million for reparations for
Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, $154
million for the homeless, $127 million for unemployment assistance,
$100 million for refugee assistance, and $88 million for public
housing.
   The Senate has yet to consider the spending bill.

   Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and killed
three Palestinians and wounded at least 63 during a general strike
Wednesday in the occupied lands, and masked attackers killed an
Arab accused of collaborating with Israel.
   Also Wednesday, more than 80 Palestinian leaders in the occupied
lands rejected a government proposal for elections leading to an
interim peace plan. The leaders, many of them pro-PLO, said the
elections were a ploy ``calculated to appeal to the media, to end
the (Palestinian) uprising and to win time.''
   They said only an international peace conference with PLO
participation can solve the Middle East conflict. Their signed
statement was the first formal response by local Palestinians to
Shamir's proposal.
   In another development, the leaders of five major Christian
denominations in Jerusalem denounced Israel's crackdown on the
uprising, protesting what they described as ``excessive use of
force'' and the ``unprovoked harrassment'' of Palestinians.
   The joint statement marked the sharpest criticism of Israel by
Christian leaders since the December 1987 start of the uprising. It
was signed by the heads of the Greek Orthodox, Roman Catholic,
Armenian, Syrian and Anglican churches.
   Wednesday's violence occurred mostly in the Gaza Strip, a
stronghold of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, which called
the strike on the anniversary of the capture of Mecca in Saudi
Arabia by the Prophet Mohammed in 630.
   The widespread clashes apparently were sparked by the death of
Sharif Khatib, 16, who was killed by troops during a confrontation
in Gaza City's Sabra neighborhood, Arab reports said. The army
confirmed that Khatib was killed by army gunfire.
   About 300 Sabra residents _ some waving outlawed Palestinian
flags and chanting ``God is great!'' _ carried Khatib's body
through the streets. Troops fired live ammunition to disperse the
funeral march, wounding at least 13 Palestinians, Arab reports said.
   The violence spread, and 17-year-old Ammal Mohammed Hussein was
fatally shot in the head by troops in the nearby Shati refugee camp.
   An army official confirmed the death but said the circumstances
were under investigation.
   At least 45 other Palestinians, most of them teen-agers, were
shot and wounded in stone-throwing clashes with troops in Gaza.
They included a 2-year-old girl from Gaza City who was seriously
injured by a plastic bullet in the head.
   In the West Bank, 8-year-old Issam Omar Aniss was fatally shot
in the chest when soldiers opened fire on stone-throwers on the
Tulkarem refugee camp, Arab hospital officials said. A least five
Palestinians were wounded in West Bank clashes, including a
9-year-old boy from Tulkarem camp who was reported in critical
condition with a plastic bullet in the eye.
   An army official confirmed 10 wounded in the occupied lands and
said he was investigating the report of the Tulkarem death. He
noted that in two cases bodies were taken by relatives for quick
burial before army investigators arrived. The army usually lags
hours behind hospitals in confirming casualties.
   Masked assailants carrying automatic rifles gunned down the
alleged collaborator, Fayek Erar, at his home in the northern West
Bank village of Ras Atiya, Arab reporters said. The 40-year-old
property dealer became the sixth victim in a week apparently
targeted for cooperating with Israel.
   The army confirmed the death and said police were investigating.
   The PLO-backed leadership of the 16-month uprising declared
Wednesday ``a day of accounting for the collaborators.''
   The four deaths brought to 451 the number of Palestinians killed
in the uprising. Eighteen Israelis also have died in the violence.
   Also Wednesday, a Palestinian detainee was found dead in his
cell at the Israel's Ketziot detention camp, where hundreds of
Palestinians are held without charge or trial.
   An army official said the man, identified as 21-year-old Omar
Hassan Ismail Sakut from Gaza's Bureij refugee camp, apparently was
killed by fellow prisoners during a dispute. He did not elaborate.
   The Palestinian leaders called on Israel to ``recognize the
necessity of negotiations with the PLO within the framework of an
international conference'' and described the PLO as the
Palestinians' ``sole legitimate representative.''
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan calls for elections in the
occupied lands to choose leaders who would negotiate an interim
settlement with Israel.
   Shamir has ruled out talks with the PLO, Israeli withdrawal from
occupied lands and the formation of a Palestinian state. The
Palestinians said they did not reject the idea of elections but
wanted any vote to be part of an overall plan leading to Israeli
withdrawal and Palestinian independence.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Alon Liel said Wednesday he
understood ``the difficulty the Palestinians are having is with the
fact that Shamir's plan is speaking about an interim agreement and
is not indicating anything about the final status.''
   However, he said the plan's main objective is to open talks.

<HEAD>New Team Taking Over in State Bureau</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five senior State Department officials are
being replaced in a major overhaul of the bureau that deals with
the Arab-Israeli dispute and India and Pakistan.
   A U.S. official, insisting on anonymity, confirmed on Wednesday
a Washington Times report that the five had been notified by John
Kelly, who is awaiting Senate confirmation to head the bureau, that
they should seek new jobs elsewhere in the foreign service.
   Kelly told them at a meeting at the department last Friday that
he wanted to make a ``fresh start,'' the official said. Kelly is
recalling James P. Covey, the U.S. deputy ambassador to Egypt, to
serve as his principal deputy in the Bureau of Near Eastern and
South Asian Affairs.
   The five officials being reassigned include Paul J. Hare, who is
running the bureau while Kelly awaits confirmation by the Senate.
   Hare, a former U.S. ambassador to Zambia, played a key role in
the meetings President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III held here this month with three visiting Middle Eastern
leaders, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir and King Hussein of Jordan.
   Hare, son of Raymod Hare, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt, is
considered primarily a specialist in African affairs. The four
others being reassigned are Howard Schaffer, A. Peter Burleigh,
William A. Kirby and Edward S. Walker.
   The bureau, one of the most complex in the State Department,
deals with the Middle East, the Persian Gulf and the Indian
subcontinent. Schaffer has specialized in India, Pakistan and
Afghanistan, Burleigh in the Gulf and Kirby and Walker on
Arab-Israeli issues.
   Covey, a protege of former Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger, has served in Israel and Egypt. Kelly, meanwhile, is a
former U.S. ambassador to Lebanon who was publicly criticized by
former Secretary of State George P. Shultz for not informing him of
instructions he had received from the National Security Council
during the surreptitious sale of U.S. weapons to Iran.
   Whether Kelly will play a dominant role in shaping U.S. policy
in the Middle East is not apparent. Dennis Ross, who heads the
Policy Planning Staff, is a specialist on the subject and one of
Baker's closest advisers. Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence
Eagleburger also is deeply interested in the area.

   The government declared its support
for the strained NATO alliance Wednesday in a rebuttal of U.S. and
British officials dismayed by its call for early superpower talks
on short-range nuclear arms.
   ``There has never been a German intention to pursue an
independent course,'' chief government spokesman Hans Klein said at
a Bonn news conference. ``It is not our intention to jeopardize the
alliance.''
   U.S. and British officials have harshly criticized Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's decision to press for prompt superpower talks to
reduce the number of short-range nuclear weapons.
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney described such negotiations
as a ``dangerous trap.'' He said it would be a mistake to risk
cutbacks in this kind of weapon while the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact
holds an advantage in conventional forces in Europe.
   Referring to criticism from British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Klein said Kohl would restate his government's position
when the two leaders meet in West Germany on Sunday.
   ``The chancellor will endeavor to explain the West German
position again in an atmosphere of trust and friendship,'' Klein
said.
   Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday harshly rejected Kohl's proposal. She
said short-range missiles are part of NATO strategy, which ``cannot
be undermined by any one country.''
   However, the West German government, responding to domestic
pressure and overtures from Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
contends the climate is right to step up arms control efforts with
the Soviet bloc.
   West Germany has said NATO should postpone a planned upgrading
of short-range missiles while pursuing negotiations on reducing
their number.
   In Copenhagen, Denmark, the Danish government on Wednesday
joined several other NATO allies that have backed West Germany's
stand on the short-range missiles.
   ``There is no need to decide on the modernization of NATO's
short-range missiles in Europe until the beginning of the 1990s,''
Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen told visiting Foreign
Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany.

   Ronald Reagan, defending President Bush
against criticism he was moving too slowly in dealing with the
Soviets, insisted Wednesday that Bush was ``doing just fine'' his
first 100 days in office.
   For his part, Bush said as he met with Reagan for the first time
since taking office, he had ``a lot more to learn'' from the former
president. About what, reporters wanted to know. ``Life its own
self,'' Bush said.
   ``I learned a lot in eight years, learned a lot about principle,
learned a lot about the world as it really is,'' Bush said.
   In a gesture of respect, Bush went to Reagan's office, 34
stories high above Los Angeles, rather than have the former
president come to him at a hotel suite. It was their first meeting
since Bush's Jan. 20 inauguration.
   Bush said he wanted to draw on Reagan's knowledge about
``changes that are taking place abroad _ Japan, NATO, Europe, all
over the place _ and get his advice.''
   Reagan, asked about Bush's first months in office, told
reporters, ``I think he's doing just fine.''
   ``He was a major part of everything that we did'' during
Reagan's eight years in office, the former president added.
   When a reporter mentioned that Bush has been criticized for
taking his time in returning to arms talks with the Soviets and
opening contacts with President Mikhail Gorbachev, Reagan
reiterated: ``He's doing just fine.''
   Asked about Oliver North's trial, in which the former National
Security Council aide said he believed he had Reagan's
authorization for operating a clandestine scheme to arm the
Nicaraguan Contras, Reagan said he and Bush both were ``in the same
boat,'' in that they could not comment on the case.
   Reagan also refused to criticize his one-time vice president for
cutting back funding for Reagan's once-prized Star Wars missile
defense plan and for seeking humanitarian aid _ not military
assistance _ for the Contra rebels.
   ``I think that I can rest assured that he means to maintain our
national security,'' Reagan said.
   Both Bush and Reagan said they hoped that arguments being heard
Wednesday that the Supreme Court would set the stage for outlawing
abortion.
   Bush said he hopes to tap Reagan for some missions or
assignments in the future. He said he had nothing specific in mind
but added, ``the respect for him (Reagan) around the world knows no
bounds.''
   Nearing the end of a hectic four-day trip, Bush later flew to
Austin to address the Texas Legislature, then he was heading to
Miami where on Thursday he will participate in a series of events
to highlight anti-drug efforts and also will dedicate an
Alzheimer's disease center.
   Addressing issues dear to the hearts of Texans, Bush called on
Congress to pass a ``responsible'' savings and loan bill and said
America was buying too much foreign oil.
   He told the lawmakers ``there is no place on Earth like Texas.''
Bush claims Texas as his adopted home state.
   ``Now, I'm no cowboy,'' Bush said. ``I pitch horseshoes for a
living but I don't ride broncos.''
   Texas' oil industry has been battered for several years by low
petroleum prices. Moreover, the state has more failed savings and
loans than any other.
   Bush said unemployment was at its lowest level in four years and
that the energy industry was being depended upon less for jobs.
   ``Still, no matter how diversified and high-tech that we become,
a strong domestic energy industry is important, still important, to
the future of this state and, in my view, all of America,'' Bush
said.
   ``I find it disturbing that nearly 50 percent of America's oil
is imported,'' said Bush, a one-time oil man. ``This is not good
for the national security of the United States of America.''
   Bush reiterated his position that the massive oil spill in
Alaska should not lead to cutbacks in oil exploration.
Conservationists have called for a ban on drilling in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.
   Bush said that ``shutting down our domestic energy production is
no answer and would merely increase our dependence on foreign oil.''
   ``We must and we will maintain a strong energy industry.''
   Bush said the continuing crisis of failures in the savings and
loan industry was among ``the few dark clouds'' still on the
horizon.
   The president praised the Senate for acting quickly on an S&amp;L
bailout bill and said ``I call on the House of Representatives to
pass a responsible S&amp;L bill as soon as possible.''
   He said his proposal includes $37 million for the Justice
Department ``so that those who willfully abuse the trust of small
savers can expect to be pursued, tried and, if guilty, put in
prison.''
   Bush flubbed a line in his speech where he was talking about
hopes to ``conquer cancer.'' Instead, he said ``cancer conquer.''
   He made a good recovery by referring to the speech given by
Texas state Treasurer Ann Richards ridiculing him during last
summer's Democratic National Convention.
   ``Ann Richards was right,'' Bush said. ``I kept putting that
silver foot in my mouth.''
   She was standing in the front row of the legislative hall and
applauded along with the rest of the crowd.

   Two researchers who say they've used ordinary
lab equipment to master fusion, the process that powers the sun and
the stars, told Congress Wednesday they will duplicate their
experiments for government scientists in hopes of quieting skeptics.
   ``We have 19 experiments being set up now,'' University of Utah
chemist Stanley Pons told the House Science Committee, including a
demonstration of room-temperature fusion for scientists from the
Los Alamos National Laboratory.
   Pons said the federal scientists will monitor the experiment at
Utah, then dismantle it and take it to the national laboratory in
New Mexico for further tests.
   Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann, of the University
of South Hampton in England, are making the arrangement to silence
some of the skepticism about their claim to have discovered a way
to achieve fusion using ordinary lab equipment assembled on a table
top.
   Their announcement of cooperation with Los Alamos came after
Rep. Sid Morrision, R-Wash., questioned them closely about why so
many other laboratories have not been able to duplicate their
results and asked if they would perform the experiment before
independent observers.
   ``We are very happy to tell people how we have been able to do
it,'' said Fleischmann, but he added that those who can't duplicate
the process should ``publish in full'' reports of their failures.
Several other researchers have said their experiments appeared to
confirm the Utah scientists' endeavors.
   Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., said reports on the fusion process
indicated that the energy levels achieved were low. She asked Pons
and Fleischmann if they had actually achieved a ``useful
temperature'' with the reaction.
   ``We've had a cell warm up to the boiling point,'' said
Fleischmann, adding, however, that scaling the process up to a
useful level, ``raises many new problems.
   ``We think it's feasible, but it will require a very high
effort.''
   Pons and Fleishmann announced their discovery March 23, stunning
nuclear physicists around the world who have attempted to achieve
fusion for 25 years using multimillion-dollar machines.
   The hearing was jammed with journalists, scientists and
industrial representatives anxious to learn more about a reaction
that some predict could produce plentiful electric power with
little environmental pollution or threat.
   Pons told the committee how he and Fleischmann had inserted
electrodes of platinum and palladium in a flask containing
deuterium oxide, or heavy water. Electrical current was applied to
the platinum electrode, Pons said, forcing deuterium atoms into the
crystal lattice of the palladium.
   He said that after the experiment ran for several hours, the
deuterium became compressed and fused, giving off heat almost four
times as great as the energy the experiment had consumed.
   The Utah researchers said they built their initial experiment
for about $100,000, but Fleischmann said that ``production of a
scale-up device will cost about 10 times that'' and that the next
phase, producing enough energy to be useful, ``would cost
millions.''
   Chase Peterson, president of the University of Utah, appeared
with Pons and urged the committee to respond quickly to the fusion
discovery by pushing for federal aid to establish a fusion research
center at the university.
   Peterson said that the Utah legislature had allocated $5 million
for the project and had collected more than $1 million in private
donations.
   ``What level of funding do you believe is needed,'' asked Rep.
George E. Brown Jr., D-Calif.
   ``The figure that comes to mind is $25 million,'' said Peterson.
   Several committee members reacted favorably to his suggestion,
but added that coming up with the money would be difficult in a
climate of budgetary restraint.
   Other scientists who testified urged the committee not to rush
to support of the Utah research.
   ``We (scientists) need at least two months to evaluate the
significance of this process,'' said Steven Jones, a Brigham Young
University fusion researcher.
   George Miley, a fusion researcher at the University of Illinois,
told the committee that putting millions of dollars into the Utah
experiment now could hurt energy research in general.
   ``A failure could set fusion research back by years,'' he said.
``I urge us to no overeact and put all our eggs in one basket.''
   Mike Saltmarsh, head of the fusion energy program at the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, said his lab and other
federal facilities have all tried to duplicate the Utah process.
   ``The results have all been negative,'' he said. ``We have seen
no heat'' generated by the process.
   Saltmarsh told the committee, ``It would be a real mistake to
try to dray firm conclusions at this point.''
   He said many questions about the Utah experiment still need to
be answered before it is understood.
   One of the elements to be investigated, said Fleischmann, is the
metal that can be used in cold fusion. The palladium used by the
Utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a
few places on Earth.
   Fleischmann said other experiments are under way to find if
other metals can be used. ``Palladium may be the best choice but
there may be also other possible choices,'' he said.
   Researchers in Texas, California and Washington have reported
what may be fusion reactions, but many other laboratories have
reported failed efforts. Scientists in the Soviet Union and Hungary
reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion.
   Fleischmann said follow-up articles detailing how the experiment
is being conducted will be published in scientific journals.
   Pons said part of the controversy revolves around the different
way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their
work. The Utah experiments have come under heavy criticism from
fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication
of the work have not been released.
   Pons said that physicists typically circulate a pre-publication
copy of their research to colleagues for informal review.
   ``For chemists, it is done in a different way,'' he said. ``The
review is left up to the journal.''
   The March 23 announcement stunned the international physics
community, which has spent millions of dollars over the last
quarter century attempting to achieve fusion using massive machines
filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100 million
degrees.
   Many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source.
The nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that
now powers atomic generating plants. Fission occurs by splitting
atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel.
   Fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or
hydrogen together. The reaction produces an atom of helium, a burst
of energy and a neutron. Experts believe fusion energy would
produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste, and that fusion
power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide, or heavy
water, a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater.
   Natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the
stars to shine. Stellar fusion is created when the massive force of
gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse, giving off heat,
light and helium. Most ``hot'' fusion research is an attempt to
duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun.

<HEAD>Judge: AIDS Child May Attend Public School, Without `Glass Cage'</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 5 grafs after 5th graf, ``All she ..., to UPDATE with
further comment from lawyers.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An incontinent, retarded 7-year-old with AIDS
may attend public school and sit at a desk alongside other mentally
disabled children her age, a federal judge ruled Wednesday.
   Eliana Martinez had been told she could attend class only if she
remained isolated inside a glass booth. Her adoptive mother, Rosa
Martinez, took her battle to court, saying she would not send her
daughter to school to sit in a ``glass cage.''
   Eliana won't have to be separated from her 10 classmates under
the ruling by U.S. District Judge Elizabeth Kvachevich, which the
child's attorney thinks will have effects around the country.
   ``And she will be at class Thursday with bells on,'' said the
attorney, Steve Hanlon, after Ms. Kovachevich ruled the child posed
no significant health risk to other children.
   ``All she understands is she will be going in to play with some
little people. She doesn't know what school is; she hasn't been to
it,'' said her mother.
   ``The judge has finally entered a ruling. I am recommending it
be followed,'' said school board attorney Crosby Few. ``The
partition is a moot question now. There won't be one. She will be
in the classroom just like the other kids. I hope this is the end
of it''
   Few said school officials had hoped to have a couple of days
before Eliana attended class. ``We had hoped to be able to educate
the parents first ... to answer all their questions and inquiries
before hand. The education will just have to come later.''
   ``It's been a difficult time for all of us,'' said Hanlon. He
said he thinks school officials ``will be as glad as we are to put
this matter behind us.''
   ``There's been a great deal of misinformation in the case,'' he
said, adding that he approved of a court requirement that the
school system educate pupils and parents at Eliana's school about
AIDS.
   The judge also noted that Mrs. Martinez didn't object to a
one-on-one aide for Eliana or a daily examination by a school nurse
to determine if attendance is advisable that day.
   In December, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sent the
case back to Ms. Kovachevich, saying the child must be placed in a
regular classroom unless evidence proves Eliana posed a significant
risk to other children through bodily secretions.
   Through affidavits and sworn statements, Ms. Kovachevich said
she learned Eliana is ``capable of being instructed not to suck or
mouth her fingers and that she is well on her way to being fully
toilet-trained.''
   The judge said she took that into consideration in making her
decision as well as two other factors. The child's doctor told the
court he doesn't think the risk merits such precautions as
isolation, and the pediatric association now makes no
recommendation for a restricted environment for youngsters who
cannot control bodily secretions.
   Initially, Ms. Kovachevich ruled Aug. 8 than Eliania could
attend Manhattan Elementary School but had to remain inside an
enclosed plexiglass partition until she was toilet-trained and
learned to stop sucking her fingers.
   Hillsborough County school officials fought attempts to admit
her. They feared she might transmit the deadly, incurable acquired
immune deficiency syndrome virus through bodily fluids.
   But Hanlon and Mrs. Martinez, a nurse who adopted Eliana as an
infant in her native Puerto Rico, isisted that to develop fully
Eliana needed to be with other children.

<HEAD>Measure Will Start National Trend, Proponents Predict</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An ordinance that would give unmarried or
homosexual city workers equal standing with married employees will
start a nationwide trend in both the public and private sectors,
supporters predicted Wednesday.
   City officials are expected to approve the measure, which
virtually redefines the family. Mayor Art Agnos endorsed the
measure at its introduction Tuesday, and eight of the 11-member
Board of Supervisors signed as sponsors.
   ``This is landmark: Putting into city law in the first major
city in the country that lesbian and gay couples and unmarried
straight couples have a right to dignity in their relationships,''
Larry Brinkin of the city's Human Rights Commission, said Wednesday.
   If approved, the ordinance would be the most far-reaching of its
kind in the country, said Matt Coles of the American Civil
Liberties Union's San Francisco chapter, who spent more than a year
helping draft the final version.
   The measure, broader than one approved in 1982 by city
supervisors but vetoed by then-Mayor Dianne Feinstein, applies to
24,000 city employees. It is not known how many would be directly
affected.
   The ordinance would ban discrimination by city agencies because
of non-traditional relationships, and would extend many benefits _
like dependent health care and pension benefits _ currently
provided only to married couples.
   It also would expand sick and bereavement leave for employees
whose lovers or parents are seriously ill or have died.
   The ordinance would also formalize non-discriminatory policies
already in effect, such as visiting rights for domestic partners at
city hospitals and city jails, said Coles.
   The only policy in practice that has not been changed to
accommodate non-traditional families is one that grants free passes
to transit workers' spouses, he said.
   Controller Sam Yockey has determined that the provisions of the
plan will not cost the city since city employees pay for dependent
health benefits.
   Supervisor Harry Britt, author of the original and the new
version of the measure, defended the need for the legislation
Wednesday.
   ``Society must not interfere with the basic relationships that
make up our lives,'' said Britt, who is gay.
   Coles believes the measure's biggest impact will be in the
private sector.
   ``This will be used by private employers and private
instutitions to finally acknowledge these types of relationships,''
he said. ``We know many have wanted to do this, but needed us to
show them how and by what standards and under what conditions.''
   The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce announced Tuesday that it
is reviewing domestic partnership policies that can voluntarily be
adopted by businesses. The chamber has not taken a stand on the
ordinance.
   Britt aide Rick Ruvolo said his office has been flooded with
inquiries about the proposal from governments, citizen groups and
companies around the world.
   San Francisco has about 158,000 ``non-family households,'' which
includes roommate situations as well as committed non-marital
relationships, said Agnos, citing 1980 Census Bureau figures. The
city has 140,000 family households.
   The only major opposition is expected to come from religious
groups.
   Norman Phillips of the San Francisco Roman Catholic Archdiocese
said the church cannot support ``any effort to weaken the
institution of marriage, to tinker with it, or put any parallel
system alongside it.''
   The law would require domestic partners to have a joint home and
share basic living expenses, although each could maintain a second
home. They also must register with City Hall or, for those wishing
confidentiality, with a notarized statement filed with a third
party, such as an attorney.
   To put the measure into effect, the board will have to negotiate
with 10 different insurance providers and with three unions which
each have seats on the seven-member health board.

<HEAD>Information Minister Reveals Details Of Alleged CIA Network</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Iran's information minister on Wednesday
revealed details of what the Iranians say is a U.S. spy operation
in Iran, alleging the agents included military officers, clergymen
and civilians, official reports said.
   In a televised news conference, Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri
said the CIA had ``carried out acts of terrorism and sabotage in
Iran, including assassinations of high-ranking officials,'' the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported. The dispatch was monitored
in Nicosia.
   ``These spy networks were organized by the United States to
infiltrate the Islamic Republic system and divert the revolution in
the next decades,'' Reyshahri said.
   IRNA quoted him as saying the Iranian agents had been recruited
by the CIA ``mainly from those Iranians calling at U.S. embassies
abroad for various purposes such as obtaining visitors visas to the
United States.''
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said last week he
had no information on the Iranian allegations. ``They make similar
claims every once in a while about American spies when they need a
little attention,'' he said.
   Reyshahri said the agents all were linked to a CIA base at
Weisbaden near Frankfurt in West Germany. He said West Germany and
an unidentified neighboring country of Iran cooperated with the CIA
in the operation.
   Reyshahri identified 20 of the alleged agents, seven of them
officers in the armed forces. He said they were only some of those
who had been arrested.
   Among those named were three senior naval commanders who,
according to unconfirmed reports from Iranian dissidents, were
executed in early April for plotting to overthrow the government.
   Reyshahri identified them as Commodore Kianoosh Hakimi, Capt.
Ghahreman Malekzadeh, and Capt. Touraj Riyahi.
   Reyshahri did not say whether any of the accused agents were
still alive or if they had been executed.
   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani, who broke the news about
the arrests on Friday, said all the alleged agents were still alive
and under interrogation.
   Though Resyhahri did not name the neighboring country accused of
cooperating with the American spy operation, he read from the
testimony of one alleged agent who said they were taken for
training to another country via Turkey.
   He said agents in the armed forces had given the CIA information
about Iranian naval movements in the Persian Gulf during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
   Reyshahri said tens of agents had been arrested and that other
arrests would follow in the coming weeks, IRNA reported.
   But he said that if the agents identified themselves before
being caught, their sentences would be shorter.
   Responding to a question from an Iranian reporter, Reyshahri
said the Iranian intelligence service, known as SAVAMA, learned
about the alleged CIA network in 1985, but that the arrests were
made only a few months ago.
   The alleged agents all passed lie detector tests before being
recruited and were given regular annual training in espionage
techniques, including the use of codes, development of photographic
film, and use of special radios and cameras, Reyshahri said.
   He said equipment used by the alleged agents, such as special
photgraphic film and cameras were imported into Iran packaged as
medicine.
   The agents allegedly reported to the CIA about Iranian military
sites, number of personnel in the armed forces and government
offices, and military and civilian flight routes, Reyshahri said.
   Reyshahri named the head of one of the alleged networks as
Masoud Dalvand, IRNA reported.
   Among the others was a Foreign Ministry expert on legal affairs,
Bahman Aqaei, and another lawyer, named Manuchehr Azar.
   Two other spies included Masoud Bidvar and Jamshid Amiri, both
employed in the oil industry.
   The only clergyman among the group was identified as
Heshmatollah Maqsudi.

   Lucille Ball, the daffy comedian whose
harebrained schemes drove her television family crazy but delighted
viewers for four decades, died Wednesday of a ruptured abdominal
artery. She was 77.
   The actress, star of the hugely popular ``I Love Lucy'' and
related situation comedies seen in more than 80 countries, had
undergone major heart surgery April 18.
   She had been recovering steadily, getting out of bed and joking
with the staff, but shortly before dawn Wednesday, she went into
cardiac arrest due to internal bleeding and could not be revived,
said Cedars-Sinai Medical Center spokesman Ronald Wise.
   She suffered a complete heart failure at 5 a.m. and 47 minutes
of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless, Wise said. ``There was
nothing to indicate this would happen,'' Wise said. ``The heart
itself apparently was not involved in Miss Ball's sudden death.''
   In the 6{-hour surgery at Cedars-Sinai, doctors replaced her
aorta and aortic valve. Although the replaced portion of Miss
Ball's aorta did not apparently fail, the entire artery was in poor
condition when she was operated upon, said Dr. Robert Kass.
   Kass, who performed the operation, said at the time the tearing
in Miss Ball's aorta ``progressed all the way down into her
abdomen.''
   Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was
considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the
sitcom format.
   ``I and 100 million others will miss her,'' said comedian George
Burns. ``But we haven't lost Lucille Ball because she's still with
us on television and we can see her on and on.''
   ``Lucille Ball possessed the gift of laughter. But she also
embodied an even greater treasure _ the gift of love,'' President
Bush said in a statement. ``She appealed to the gentler impulses of
the human spirit. She was not merely an actress or comedienne. She
was Lucy and she was loved.''
   ``Her red hair, her antics on the screen, her timing and her
zest for life made her an American institution,'' former President
and Nancy Reagan said in a statement. ``Just the mention of her
name brings a smile. ... We love Lucy and will miss her deeply.''
   ``It's a shock after working very closely with her and loving
her for over 35 years,'' said Miss Ball's frequent sidekick, Gale
Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta.
   While in the hospital, the comedian was deluged with thousands
of cards, letters, flowers and phone calls from fans as far away as
Australia and Europe.
   Miss Ball and her late former husband, Desi Arnaz, starred in
``I Love Lucy'' from 1951 to 1957 and have been seen since in
widely syndicated reruns. The late Vivian Vance and William Frawley
played their neighbors, Fred and Ethel Mertz.
   Her split-second timing, wide-mouthed wails and exaggerated
pratfalls made the ``I Love Lucy'' show one of the most popular in
television history.
   Bridge clubs and bowling teams changed their meeting nights to
watch Lucy and Ethel cook up still another ridiculous scheme that
would push their long-suffering husbands to exasperation.
   Miss Ball's real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in
television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the
inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953,
to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky. The real birth occurred
just four hours before the previously-filmed show was broadcast.
   Miss Ball's singularity as a comedian was matched by her talent
as a show-business entrepreneur. She and Arnaz established one of
TV's first major independent studios.
   Desilu, as their production company was called, made some of the
top comedy shows of the 1950s and '60s, including ``December
Bride,'' ``Our Miss Brooks'' and ``Make Room for Daddy.''
   As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and
Arnaz signed an $8 million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with
CBS in 1953 _ the largest in television history at the time and a
figure scarcely any TV star can touch today.
   The couple stopped making weekly ``I Love Lucy'' shows in 1957.
Despite riches and two children, Lucie and Desi Jr., their marriage
foundered, and the couple divorced in 1960.
   In 1961, Miss Ball married nightclub comic Gary Morton, who
became her executive producer, and remained on TV for 12 more years
in the weekly ``Here's Lucy'' and ``The Lucy Show.''
   Miss Ball was born Aug. 6, 1911, in Jamestown, N.Y., the
daughter of an electrician and a concert pianist.
   Young Lucy, a brunette, was dazzled by the stage, but her
ambitions were discouraged by an acting school _ ``They sent my
mother a letter saying she was wasting her money,'' Miss Ball once
said _ and she turned to modeling under the name Diane Belmont.
   Her ads for Chesterfield cigarettes caught Hollywood's eye, and
in 1933 she went to California. As a blonde, she appeared with the
Marx Brothers in ``Room Service,'' with Fred Astaire in ``Follow
the Fleet'' and with Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers in ``Stage
Door.''
   In all, she appeared in more than 75 movies.
   In 1940, her tresses colored the fiery trademark red, Miss Ball
met Arnaz, a rumba star. They married within six months.
   In 1951, when CBS decided to move her radio series, ``My
Favorite Husband,'' to television, Miss Ball insisted that Arnaz be
her co-star. But the network wasn't sure Arnaz would be a hit with
the American public.
   The couple went on a nationwide vaudeville tour and proved
audiences would watch a leggy, blue-eyed comedian and a Cuban-born
band leader with a heavy accent. They also produced their own pilot
episode on borrowed money.
   CBS relented, and ``I Love Lucy'' was an immediate success.
   The show revolutionized television sitcom production in the days
before videotape. It was filmed in advance before a live audience,
employing three cameras instead of the traditional one used for
motion pictures.
   The actress was last seen at the 61st Academy Awards ceremony
March 29, where the svelte actress received a standing ovation and
laughed freely throughout her brief bit with Bob Hope.
   Her last series _ ``Life with Lucy,'' once again co-starring
Gordon _ was carried by ABC at the start of the 1986 season. But
the show, her first series in 12 years, was canceled after less
than two months when it drew spectacularly low ratings. She ``felt
terrible. ... It really devastated her,'' daughter Lucie Arnaz said
at the time.
   Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie ``Stone
Pillow,'' considered one of the most challenging roles of her
career. She was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over, but
the movie was a minor critical and ratings success.
   Just this month, Miss Ball had signed a deal for a reported
$750,000 with Putnam to publish her autobiography.
   Said CBS Chairman William Paley: ``Lucille Ball will always be
the first lady of CBS. ... Lucy's extraordinary ability to light up
the screen and brighten our lives is a legacy that will last
forever.''
   Funeral arrangements were pending.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev said in a speech released
Wednesday that shortages of housing, food and consumer goods are
growing despite his reforms. He blamed runaway government spending
and Soviets who ``forgot how to work.''
   In one of his frankest admissions of the Soviet Union's
problems, he said citizens vented their anger March 26, when at
least three dozen senior Communist Party candidates were defeated
in parliamentary elections.
   Gorbachev said perestroika _ the program he launched four years
ago to overhaul Soviet economy and society _ remains the proper
course, but reforms are not being put into effect properly,
particularly at the local level.
   His harsh criticism appeared to set the stage for even more
radical measures.
   ``The food problem is far from solved,'' the president said.
``The housing problem is acute. There is a dearth of consumer goods
in the shops. The list of shortages is growing. The state's
financial position is grave.''
   He also blamed top party leadership. In an unusually pointed
attack, he singled out those responsible for particular failures,
such as importing millions of medical syringes with no needles.
   The construction industry, he said, ``has been shoveling
billions of rubles into the ground and is creating actual ruins.''
He said building a factory to produce detergent is in its ninth
year, while people face daily shortages of soap and detergent.
   Individual workers share the blame, he said.
   ``Many forgot how to work. They got used to being paid often
just for coming to work.''
   However, he said people ``respond badly to shortages and to
queues, which take time and, to put it frankly, humiliate people.''
   He spoke in a closing address Tuesday at a closed-door meeting
of the party's policy-making Central Committee, but the news agency
Tass did not release the speech until Wednesday.
   The speech followed a housecleaning in which the Central
Committee swept 110 senior officials from leadership. Many had
already retired or been ousted from posts entitling them to seats
on the committee or its financial arm.
   Gorbachev told the session, ``The activity of a series of party
committees and Soviet organs in their attitudes, in style and work
methods, in their understanding of the processes taking place did
not keep pace with life. ... This also relates to the party's
Central Committee and to its Politburo.''
   Many leaders were caught in an ``inertia of old thinking,'' he
said.
   Retiring the so-called ``dead souls,'' many of them holdovers
from the era of the late Leonid Brezhnev, and promoting nearly wo
dozen non-voting members named after Gorbachev took power to full
voting membership helped strengthen the president's hand in
pressing for further reform.
   The 58-year-old Kremlin chief paid tribute to those stepping
down, calling their resignations ``a brave step'' that represented
a shift to a new generation of party officials.
   He said that in light of the voting in the Soviet Union's first
competitive nationwide balloting, all levels of party and
government must review their work ``so their activity meets the
scale of the tasks being tackled by the country.''
   He proposed that the Central Committee convene again before the
first session of the parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies,
to review election results and set procedures for the new body.
   Gorbachev regularly complains about Soviet problems which for
decades were routinely ignored or denied. But this time he went
into considerable detail and said the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power
plant disaster and falling price of oil _ the Soviet Union's main
export _ cannot be cited as catch-all excuses.
   The explosion at Chernobyl, near Kiev, killed 31 people and sent
a cloud of radioactive dust into the atmosphere.
   Gorbachev blamed poor agricultural production on ``the work
level, initiative and responsibility of local leaders.''
   He said the problem became especially acute after the central
leadership began delegating some power and decision-making to the
local level.
   When people turn to local bureaucrats for help, they encounter
``the old atmosphere, where every visitor is looked down upon as
being very nearly persona non grata, an undesirable phenomenon,''
he complained.
   ``This causes special resentment,'' he said.
   He said in many areas, the economy has deteriorated and
shortages are increasing, in part because economic reforms were not
fully thought out before being implemented. He said many problems
can be traced to wasteful government spending.
   Economists project the budget deficit will amount to $162
billion this year.
   Gorbachev also noted crime has risen as society has become more
democratic, especially in areas where nationalism is on the rise.
   He pledged a thorough investigation of the bloody April 9 clash
between troops and pro-independence demonstrators in Soviet Georgia.
   ``It's already clear now that we should all use political
methods and the force of law not to permit a repetition of anything
similar,'' Gorbachev said in his first public remarks about the
incident.

   A former senior federal housing official on
Wednesday denied violating any ethics or conflict of interest laws
when she became a consultant on U.S. commercial trade activity with
the Soviet Union shortly after leaving her government post.
   Appearing before the House Government Operations subcommittee on
employment and housing, June Koch, former assistant secretary of
Housing and Urban Development, described her contacts with her
former colleagues at HUD as ``distinctly and definitely
informational.''
   She said her contacts with agency officials were not an attempt
to influence their decisions concerning visits by Soviets in
connection with a cooperation agreement in the field of housing and
other construction.
   Koch served as HUD's assistant secretary for policy development
and research from July 1984 until she resigned in October 1987.
   She was appointed in 1985 to direct commercial trade activities
with the Soviets in connection with the agreement, making her
responsible for organizing and managing an international trade show
``Stroyindustriya '87'' in Moscow.
   HUD sponsored about 110 U.S. companies at the event at a cost of
$1.6 million which the Government Operations panel last year called
``misguided, mismanaged and misspent.''
   During the panel's probe, several companies complained of being
``misled and pressured'' to participate in the show and questions
arose about the propriety of the former housing official allegedly
trying to solicit them as clients after leaving HUD.
   After leaving the housing agency Koch became president of
Construction, Marketing and Trading Inc., a consulting firm
providing assistance to U.S. companies wanting to do business with
the Soviet Union.
   She also was hired as a HUD consultant for six months, an
agreement the GAO said was extended twice and terminated in January
1989. Koch contended that she ``worked for HUD consulting all of
five or six days.''
   ``This is not a case of a revolving door at HUD. Rather it
appears that the door at HUD was never closed to June Koch,''
Lantos said as he opened the hearing.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, said
Wednesday that he asked the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, to investigate Koch's actions and
business activities after leaving the government.
   Koch said that while still a HUD assistant secretary and a
member of a HUD delegation accompanying then-Housing Secretary
Samuel Pierce to Moscow in early October 1987 she discussed with
Soviet officials her impending resignation.
   She said the Soviets wanted her to arrange meetings with U.S.
business representatives that could provide construction products
and services.
   GAO determined that Koch's contacts with HUD were not
informational but ``for the purpose of securing meetings and
receptions on behalf of herself and her clients with members of the
visiting Soviet delegations,'' said John Ols, a GAO official.
   GAO criticized HUD's monitoring of Koch's post-government
activities and recommended the matter be referred to the Justice
Department for further investigation. Lantos said would decide soon
whether to follow the GAO recommendation.

   Crews worked Wednesday to repair cracks in an
aqueduct one day after it was damaged in an earthquake that killed
one person and shook an area from the capital to the Pacific coast
resort of Acapulco.
   Four people were injured in Tuesday's quake, which measured 6.8
on the Richter scale, but little major damage was reported.
   Cracks appeared in buildings in Mexico City and Acapulco, and
telephone, electrical and subway service in the capital were
interrupted.
   The tremor felled a power line just north of the city center
that electrocuted a man of about 30, said Maria Cortina Benitez, a
city police spokeswoman.
   Water was being trucked to neighborhoods in the southeastern
part of the city that were left without service because of the
aqueduct damage. Officials said said residents of affected areas
should have clean water again by Friday.
   Inspectors checked schools and some high-rise office buildings
for damage.
   The movement set off landslides on a rural road near Acapulco,
the Excelsior news service said.
   The epicenter of Tuesday's quake was 40 miles east of Acapulco,
about 200 miles south of Mexico City, said the U.S. National
Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.
   The tremor terrified people who recalled a 1985 quake that
crumbled many buildings in the capital and killed at least 9,500
people.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage in populated
areas. A quake of magnitude 7 is considered a major earthquake,
capable of widespread, heavy damage in populated areas.

   Attackers shot and killed a leftist
politician, his wife and their 8-year-old daughter as they slept at
home Wednesday in a highland city, and an anti-rebel death squad
was suspected, police said.
   Police said the politician, Benigno Ayala, was an official in
the local branch of the United Left Party, a Marxist coalition and
Peru's second strongest party. Ayala had been suggested as a
candidate in congressional elections set for 1990.
   The shooting occurred in Cangallo, about 250 miles southeast of
Lima. The impoverished highlands around nearby Ayacucho are a
stronghold of the Maoist Shining Path guerrilla group, whose
nine-year insurgency has claimed more than 14,000 lives.
   Police said the newly formed Rodrigo Franco Command is suspected
in Wednesday's attack.
   The group is named after a member of the governing center-left
Aprista Party, who was shot to death by the Shining Path. The
Franco Command has vowed to kill people it considers leftist
guerrillas or their supporters.
   The government has denied any links to the Franco Command.

   Syrian soldiers fired rockets at the
coast north of Beirut on Wednesday, sending a ship fleeing from
port and blocking the only escape routes for thousands of
beleaguered Christians, police said.
   The sporadic bombardment coincided with renewed efforts by the
Arab League to halt the latest round in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil
war and arrange political reforms to give Moslems an equal share of
power with the Christians.
   Police said the Syrians and militiamen of Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party fired their multibarreled
rocket launchers from hilltop positions around Beirut overnight and
during the day.
   Their fire targeted a 10-mile coastal stretch between Jounieh
and Byblos, the main ports of the besieged 310-square-mile
Christian enclave.
   An unidentified commercial ship docked in Amsheet harbor just
north of Byblos sailed quickly out to sea when shells fell around
it, police said.
   Army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian forces struck
back with 155mm artillery fire at Syrian and Druse positions around
Moslem west Beirut.
   No casualties were reported on either side.
   At least 272 people have been killed and 991 wounded, by police
count, since the current round of civil war fighting broke out
March 8.
   Two Cypriot-flagged ferry boats had been running the gantlet of
Syrian and Druse shellfire in the past five weeks to evacuate more
than 13,000 Christians from the blockaded enclave through Jounieh.
   But sailings by the Larnaca Rose and the Baroness M were
suspended Monday in a shipping ban imposed by Aoun so that a French
navy tanker could unload 6,000 tons of fuel needed to reactivate
Lebanon's shuttered power plants.
   Power was restored in Beirut on Tuesday for two hours a day,
ending a 10-day blackout caused by lack of fuel at the capital's
main power plants.
   A convoy of 10 trucks carrying 35 tons of medical supplies from
Kuwait rolled into west Beirut on Wednesday, completing a three-day
journey across Iraq, Jordan and Syria. Dr. Mohammed Mohanna, a
senior Health Ministry official, said the aid would be split
between Moslem and Christian areas to ease an acute shortage of
medicines in hospitals throughout Lebanon.
   In Tunis, Arab League foreign ministers opened an emergency
meeting on Lebanon, and Secretary-General Chedli Klibi said a
cease-fire must take effect before the country's problems can be
solved.
   The ministers are discussing a peace plan for Lebanon that would
include sending a multinational observer force of at least 200 Arab
officers to monitor a cease-fire.
   Aoun has given tacit approval to the dispatch of an Arab
observer force ``as a first step'' toward ending the fighting. But
he said he still intends to end ``the Syrian and Israeli occupation
of Lebanese territory.''
   Syria maintains 40,000 troops in Moslem areas under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League. Israel occupies a border
strip in south Lebanon as a buffer zone against cross-border raids
by Palestinian guerrillas.
   Hoss also declared support for the Arab League peace plan,
saying in statement released Wednesday that an ``immediate end
should be put to the horrific cycle of violence gripping Lebanon.''
   But Shiite Moslem militia leader Nabih Berri, a major Syrian
ally, rejected the proposal for an Arab observer force.

<HEAD>Hungarian Cabinet Reshuffled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth proposed six new
ministers to the Presidential Council for approval in a major
Cabinet reshuffle, the state news agency MTI reported Wednesday.
   Nemeth, a 41-year-old economist, announced plans to revamp the
government on April 14, two days after changes were made in the
Communist Party's ruling Politburo.
   He was quoted as complaining then that his government lacked ``a
necessary harmony in outlook and unity of action,'' leading to
``delays, vacillations and hurried acts.''
   MTI said Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi will become Hungary's
ambassador in Washington and Gyula Horn, secretary of state at the
Foreign Ministry, will become foreign minister.
   In other changes: deputy minister Laszlo Bekesi will replace
Miklos Vilanyi as finance minister; Ferenc Horvath, secretary of
state in the Industry Ministry will replace Frigyes Berecz as
industry minister; Csaba Hutter, president of an agricultural
cooperative at Szecseny, will succeed Jenoe Vancsa as agriculture
minister; historian Ferenc Glatz will succeed Tibor Czibere as
minister of education and culture, and Ernoe Kemenes, secretary of
state of the National Planning Office, will replace Janos Hoos as
planning chief.
   Parliament is to approve the new ministers at its next session
on May 10.
   Under the constitution, Parliament has supreme power. It elects
a Presidential Council, which exercises the functions of Parliament
between sessions.
   Imre Pozsgay, Hungary's leading Politburo reformer, said
Wednesday that he hopes elections with competing parties will be
held in Hungary next year.
   Interviewed by Channel 4 News in London, Pozsgay said he favored
advancing the limited election planned for 1995 and expanding it to
a fully contested election.
   ``I think it could be that we will bring forward the free
elections and it's possible that the Hungarian Socialist Workers
Party (the ruling Communist party) will come out as winner of this
election,'' he said.
   Pozsgay, who held talks on Tuesday with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, said he would like to see Hungary adopt some aspects of
her free-market, monetarist economic principles.
   Pozsgay is visiting Britain as patron of a Hungarian arts and
music festival that opens in London on Oct. 25.

<HEAD>Damaging Thunderstorms in Iowa; Record Highs in the Southeast, Midwest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Flooding forced hundreds of West Virginians out of their homes
Wednesday, and intense thunderstorms pummeled Iowa with winds up to
75 mph and hail as big as golf balls.
   High-temperature records were set or tied in 12 cities in the
Midwest and Southeast, while up to 8 inches of spring snow fell in
the mountains of the West.
   Heavy overnight rains in central West Virginia caused floods
that forced at least 200 people out of their homes Wednesday
morning and closed schools in four counties, officials said.
   Widely scattered light rain and drizzle fell across sections of
the state during the day, but most small streams receded to normal
levels and evacuees returned to their homes in the afternoon.
   Some rivers continued to rise. The Little Kanawaha River was
expected to rise 3 to 4 feet above flood stage at Creston, W.Va.
   Northern Iowa's storms blew a roof off a barn and destroyed a
hog barn near Little Rock. Winds gusted to 75 mph and golf
ball-size hail fell in Spirit Lake and gusts were clocked at 70 mph
in West Okoboji. In the Estherville area, dime-size hail and
three-fourths of an inch of rain fell in just 20 minutes.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell in southern Minnesota,
western Wyoming and central Montana. Rain showers were scattered
across eastern Washington state.
   Snow fell at higher elevations of northwest Wyoming, southeast
Idaho. About 8 inches of snow has fallen at the Alta, Utah, ski
area.
   The snow was expected to spread across the Montana Rockies. A
winter storm watch was in effect for Wednesday night and Thursday
in the mountains and foothills of Montana and for Thursday in
south-central Montana.
   Record heat that baked the western Plains earlier this week
spread Wednesday to the Mississippi Valley and the southern
Atlantic Coast. Temperatures were in the 80s and 90s from the
southern Plains and Kansas to the middle and lower Mississippi
Valley, the western lower Ohio Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the
Gulf Coast states, the southern Atlantic Coast and Florida.
   High-temperature records for the date were set in eight cities
and tied in four.
   Nashville, Tenn., tied its all-time high temperature for April,
set in 1980, with a reading of 90 degrees.
   Other records included Lincoln, Neb., where the reading of 94
degrees exceeded the old mark set in 1987 by 2 degrees; Topeka,
Kan., (93, 92 in 1987); Evansville, Ind. (89, 87 in 1981); Paducah,
Ky. (87, 85 in 1986) and Charleston, S.C. (90, 88 in 1984).
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 36
degrees at Jackson and Cody, Wyo., to 95 degrees at Medicine Lodge,
Kan. The nation's low Wednesday morning was 15 degrees in Truckee,
Calif.
   Thursday's forecast called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Plains to the middle and upper Mississippi
Valley and rain showers in parts of the northern and central
Rockies, with snow in higher elevations of the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 40s and 50s from eastern
portions of the north-central Intermountain region to the northern
and central Rockies, much of the northern Plains, northern
Minnesota, the northern Great Lakes region and New England; the 80s
and low 90s from the central and southern Plains to the middle and
lower Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the Gulf Coast
states, Florida and the southern Atlantic Coast; the 80s in the
desert Southwest; and generally in the 60s and 70s in the rest of
the nation.

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Leaders Call For Conference To Halt Natal Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-apartheid leaders
Wednesday called for a peace conference to end fighting between
political factions in Natal province that has killed more than
1,400 blacks since 1986.
   Representatives of the banned United Democratic Front and the
Congress of South African Trade Unions told a news conference that
their affiliates in Natal share a commitment with the Zulu
political organization, Inkatha, ``to a mass movement for peace.''
   Crowds supporting the two sides fought in the Natal town of
Mpophomeni Tuesday, killing five people and injuring five. Police
firing tear gas and birdshot broke up the battle and arrested 196
people, authorities said.
   Both sides agree the violence must stop, but previous peace
initiatives have failed to halt the beatings, arson fires, and
revenge killings that occur almost daily in Zulu townships and
villages.
   United Democratic Front spokesman Murphy Morobe, who is not
restricted from political activity even though his organization is
banned, said affiliated community groups in Natal had approved the
peace plan.
   However, Morobe said he was wary of possible government
interference.
   ``It would seem to us that when we are on the verge of a major
political initiative to break through the cycle of violence, the
apartheid state has moved systematically to undermine the political
process we are engaged in,'' he said in a statement.
   He referred to a speech Monday by Law and Order Minister Adriaan
Vlok that blamed front supporters for the violence. Vlok predicted
the peace efforts would fail and said church officials organizing
the initiative were naive.
   The front is allied with the outlawed African National Congress.
The ANC criticizes Inkatha's opposition to boycotts, sanctions and
other confrontational methods of battling South Africa's policy of
racial segregation.

<HEAD>Dubcek Appears On Hungarian TV Despite Prague Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungarian television ignored a protest
from Prague on Wednesday and broadcast a second excerpt of a
three-hour interview with Alexander Dubcek, leader of
Czechoslovakia's 1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms.
   It was the first official Soviet bloc interview with Dubcek
since he was ousted as Czechoslovak Communist Party leader in April
1969.
   The 40-minute excerpt showed Dubcek making a spirited attack on
Leonid I. Brezhnev, who was Soviet president at the time. Brezhnev
died in 1982.
   ``It was Brezhnev's dogmatism that endangered socialism,''
Dubcek said, recalling a meeting three weeks before the Soviet-led
Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968.
   Dubcek said he rejected Kremlin pressure to halt his reforms.
   ``I could not become the gravedigger of our new policies,'' he
said. ``I told the Russians that we have the overwhelming support
of the people.''
   ``I want to make it clear that there was no counterrevolutionary
threat,'' Dubcek said, contradicting the Kremlin's justification
for the invasion. ``Yet they keep teaching this lie.''
   He was referring to Czechoslovak history books still in use
today.
   Czechoslovakia's current president, Gustav Husak, and current
party leader, Milos Jakes, were among those most active in crushing
Dubcek's reforms.
   Many of the reforms initiated by Dubcek are similar to those now
under way in the Soviet Union, Hungary and Poland.
   While Hungary is slowly rehabilitating the leaders of Hungary's
1956 anti-communist revolt, Jakes last week ruled out Dubcek's
rehabilitation.
   The first installment of the Dubcek interview was shown on April
17.
   On Wednesday, Czechoslovak media reported that Prague's
ambassador to Hungary, Vlastimil Ehrenberger, formally protested
the April 17 broadcast, in which Dubcek attacked former Hungarian
and Polish leaders for not doing more to prevent the 1968 invasion.
   Dubcek spoke in Slovak, dubbed over in Hungarian and translated
into English by The Associated Press.
   Hungarian TV is widely received in southern Slovakia, home to
about 700,000 ethnic Hungarians.
   Czechoslovakia was invaded by Warsaw Pact forces of the Soviet
Union, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria and East Germany in August 1968.
   Wednesday's late-night broadcast also contained an interview
with Yugoslav dissident Milovan Djilas, who was jailed in the 1950s
and ousted from his senior Communist Party positions after
challenging then Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito.
   He spoke mostly on the ethnic tension in Yugoslavia, saying a
system with competing political parties would not necessarily solve
the conflicts and might even foster more nationalism.

<HEAD>FCC Allows Phone Company to Test Cable TV System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday gave General Telephone Co. of California permission to
build a coaxial cable TV system and permission to test a
state-of-the-art fiber-optic system that will allow customers to
order movies every 15 minutes by phone.
   The ruling, which was watched closely by cable TV operators who
fear entry of huge telephone companies into their turf, affirmed a
preliminary decision last year to let General Telephone build and
operate the coaxial (bundled copper wire) cable system in the Los
Angeles suburb of Cerritos. GTE of California also provides phone
service to Cerritos.
   The FCC said there had been no adequate bids submitted to the
city of Cerritos for cable service except from General Telephone.
GTE is leasing the system to Apollo CableVision to provide
programming.
   A GTE affiliate, GTE Services Corp., will install a fiber-optic
cable network to experiment with services such as near-video on
demand, which will allow customers to phone in orders for movies
that will be running on 30 channels. Some movies will begin every
15 minutes.
   Wednesday's decision was challenged immediately by the National
Cable Television Association, which said it appears to violate
federal rules generally barring telephone companies from the cable
TV business.
   Current rules bar phone companies from generating cable
programming in the same areas where they provide telephone service.
Federal rules also bar the seven regional Bell operating companies
from owning cable services anywhere in the country, but allow
companies like GTE to do so outside their service areas.
   The FCC in July 1988 preliminarily voted to consider
recommending to Congress that telephone companies be allowed into
cable TV in the regions they serve. The FCC also suggested it would
try to encourge telephone companies to enter cable TV, even if
Congress fails to act, by broadly defining ``good cause'' for
waivers.
   The FCC said it probably would grant waivers if telephone
companies wire homes with fiber and allow competitors to use those
wires to sell video programs too.
   FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick said Wednesday's ruling did not
presage any final FCC judgment on the cable-telephone company issue.
   ``This grant of this very limited waiver may produce very
valuable information that will be useful to the commssion and the
Congress in evaluating that more generic question,'' he said. ``The
precedent that results is narrow.''

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's purge of the Communist
Party's hierarchy had been long expected but became more pressing
with the party's poor electoral showing and his growing impatience
with the pace of reform.
   The Central Committee personnel changes he oversaw and his
highly critical remarks at a committee meeting Tuesday about poor
management by leaders appeared to set the stage for even more
radical reform in his program of perestroika, or wholesale
restructuring of the economy and society.
   Many senior party officials fared poorly in March 26 elections
to the parliament, the Congress of People's Deputies, when they
faced opposition for the first time.
   And when the Congress meets May 25, party members may encounter
true dissent for the first time in such a setting, from the likes
of human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov and historian Roy A.
Medvedev.
   Although the vast majority of the 2,250 deputies are party
members, several, such as ousted Moscow party boss Boris N.
Yeltsin, are outspoken mavericks.
   In addition, at least three dozen party chiefs from around the
country, including Yuri Solovyev, a non-voting member of the ruling
Politburo who is party boss in Leningrad, and the premiers of
Latvia and Lithuania, were defeated.
   The president's carefully orchestrated removal of 110 officials
at the Central Committee meeting came exactly one month before the
congress convenes to pick a smaller, more powerful legislature.
   It was not immediately clear whether any of the 110 ousted
officials had run in the parliamentary elections, but their
departure allows Gorbachev to put the party's house in order before
the congress convenes and begins a new phase in political reform.
   Those purged included Andrei A. Gromyko, Mikhail S. Solomentsev
and other holdovers from the Leonid I. Brezhnev era, now denounced
as ``the period of stagnation.''
   Last summer, at the party's first nationwide conference in 47
years, Gromyko and Solomentsev came under fire for conducting
now-discredited Brezhnev policies.
   Gromyko was retired as president, and Solomentsev lost his seat
on the ruling Politburo last fall in another shake-up.
   The elections gave a clear signal to the party to move fast on
perestroika.
   ``The Soviet people have pronounced themselves not just for
perestroika, but also for its further deepening, for greater
resolution in its implementation, for a most rapid change for the
better in all spheres of our life,'' Gorbachev said in a closing
speech to the Central Committee.
   All party bodies, including the Politburo he heads, must realize
that they ``did not keep pace with life,'' said Gorbachev, also the
party's general secretary.
   After the meeting, party ideology chief Vadim A. Medvedev told a
news conference that the party was reviewing election results to
determine whether losing candidates should retain their posts.
   Last week, Leningrad party officials decided not to remove
Solovyev as their leader despite his embarrassing loss at the
polls, even without an opposing candidate.
   Gorbachev promoted younger, more dynamic figures on the
policy-making body, trimming it to a more manageable size with a
higher proportion of tested supporters. The Central Committee,
which fell from 301 to 251 full members, has not been so small
since the days of Nikita S. Khrushchev, who ruled from 1953-1964, a
Western diplomat said.
   Among the new full members thought to be close to Gorbachev are
Yevgeny P. Velikhov, vice president of the Academy of Sciences, and
Yevgeny M. Primakov, director of the Institute of World Economics
and International Relations.
   Gorbachev said some officials had wanted to overhaul the Central
Committee at last summer's party conference, but that action was
postponed.
   Personal changes were required now, he said, because after the
election, ``the situation has changed considerably.''
   Normally, such changes would be made at a party congress, but
the next session isn't scheduled until 1991, and it appeared
Gorbachev couldn't wait that long to prune dead wood.
   The senior officials offered Gorbachev a tactful, graceful way
to remove them out without antagonizing their supporters. In a
letter, they themselves offered to step aside.
   ``This way they go with honor. This would ensure they retain
privileges of a pensioner,'' the diplomat said on condition of
anomymity.

   Here are excerpts from Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's speech Tuesday at the full meeting of the Communist
Party Central Committee, as translated and released Wednesday by
the Tass news agency:
   On recent elections to the new Soviet parliament:
   In this sense much food for thought has been offered by the past
elections which became, as we now say, an effective referendum, one
in favor of perestroika (restructuring). The elections
unequivocally said yes to perestroika.
   On food shortages:
   The food problem is far from solved. It keeps us concerned and
we dealt with all related issues at the last Central Committee
plenum. The housing problem is acute.
   There is a dearth of consumer goods in the shops. The list of
shortages is growing. The state's financial position is grave.
   People respond badly to shortages and to queues which take time
and, to put it frankly, humiliate people. People regard this
situation as a gap between words and deeds, as inconsistency
between promises and real changes in life.
   On nationalities:
   Further sharp issues have arisen from, let us be blunt about it,
the long-neglected need to perfect the Soviet multinational
federation, and nationalist, extremist and anti-Soviet elements are
attempting to exploit this fact in a number of localities. They are
being joined in these attempts by people who are political failures
or, more frequently, ordinary careerists.
   On general discontent:
   They (people) are displeased with the organization of the work
of the trade and services sphere and city transport, with the
long-neglected sanitary condition of the cities, with the absence
of resolute struggle against economic mismanagement, violations of
the rule of law, with the ecological state of the cities and
settlements, with the attitude to cultural monuments.
   On reaction to political reforms:
   The fact is that some have already gone as far as saying that,
in a manner of speaking, both democracy and openness are very
nearly a disaster. And the fact that the people have begun to act,
that they no longer wish to remain silent and insist on their
claims, is perceived as taking restructuring too far.
   On causes of the economic crisis:
   What happened? Of course, there were things that could not be
foreseen _ the Chernobyl accident, the decline of prices on the
petroleum market and some other things. But, comrades, this can
hardly account for all that has taken place in the economy,
particularly on the consumer market.
   Military spending, uncompleted construction, managerial costs,
and expenditures on the realization of some huge-scale projects and
so on continued to grow.
   The major economic principle _ the priority of the rise in labor
productivity over the increase in wages and salaries _ was
seriously undermined. Negative trends in this field go on gathering
strength so far rather than fade out.
   On economic mismanagement:
   The outcome of mismanagement which repeated itself from year to
year was that a whole system of parasitic elements developed. ...
The system which sows seeds of corruption, economic and criminal
offenses, and anti-social morality around itself. The system which
defends the conditions of its parasitising, and in many cases not
without success.
   People see all these ugliest facts of mismanagement and justly
demand a strict punishment of the culprits, not because of
vengeance but to assert the realisation that it is inadmissible and
impossible to throw the people's resources to the winds.
   I think, comrades, and this is opinion of the entire Politburo _
that we can no longer put up with mismanagement which literally
compromises perestroika and does a tremendous damage _ economic and
moral _ to the whole of society.
   On Georgia:
   The Politburo gave instructions to painstakingly analyze
everything that has happened there. It is clear already now,
however, that we must do everything, using political methods and
the force of the law in order to prevent a repetition of similar
developments. The deepening and broadening of the party's natural
ties with the masses, the working people, their cohesion and unity
are the guarantee of the success of society's renewal that has
begun, and of the success of restructuring.
   On Central Committee members who were retired:
   One generation of party members has naturally to replace
another. This process should be perceived as such. Its correct
perception also presupposes the fact that each generation makes its
contribution to the history of the country and the people and that
a new stage in the development of our state, our society and in
achievement of new frontiers is connected with each generation.

   The birth of the second baby conceived in the
United States by non-surgical transfer of a fertilized egg into one
of the mother's fallopian tubes was announced Wednesday by a doctor
in suburban Fairfax, Va.
   Dr. Joseph D. Schulman, director of the Genetics &amp; IVF Institute
in Fairfax, said the 4-pound, 15-ounce baby girl was born April 12
by caesarian section.
   Although premature at 36 1@2 weeks, the baby was pronounced
healthy shortly after her birth, Dr. Schulman said.
   Another baby girl conceived through the same procedure was born
April 9 by normal delivery at the University of California at
Irvine.
   Both babies were conceived by a process known as zygote
intrafallopian transer, or ZIFT. A zygote is fertilized egg.
   This process and gamete intrafallopian transfer, or GIFT, are
relatively new techniques that can be used when at least one of a
woman's fallopian tubes appears normal, said a news release from
the institute.
   A gamete is a mature sex cell, either sperm or egg.
   In vitro fertilization has been accomplished by non-surgical
means for some time, but the ZIFT and GIFT procedures had until
recently required placement of the zygotes or gametes into the
fallopian tube by a surgical procedure, the release said.
   The baby's parents, who reside in the Washington area, were not
identified. The announcement said they were referred to Dr.
Schulman in May 1986, after failing to conceive as a result of more
standard treatments.
   The woman had three fertilized eggs placed non-surgically in her
right fallopian tube in August 1988. She was confirmed to be
pregnant about 11 days later.

<HEAD>United Official Says Airline Failed To Inspect Door</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cargo door that blew off a United Airlines
Boeing 747 in an accident that killed nine people went uninspected
after major repairs, violating a federal requirement, a United
executive testified Wednesday.
   Robert Doll, a vice president for technical services, told
National Transportation Safety Board investigators that the airline
was unaware it had to inspect the locking mechanism after the Dec.
23 repairs in Chicago.
   ``I can't explain why it was missed,'' Doll said in the second
day of the hearing as investigators continued to press the airline
for details on the maintenance and operation of the forward cargo
door.
   The door is a prime suspect in the accident, in which nine
passengers were hurled to their deaths Feb. 24 over the Pacific
Ocean near Hawaii. The cargo door and part of the fuselage tore off
United Flight 811 at 23,000 feet about 85 miles southwest of
Honolulu.
   The plane was bound for Sydney, Australia, via Auckland, New
Zealand, with 337 passengers and a crew of 18.
   Speculation has focused on a possible malfunction in the locking
mechanism of the cargo door which remains on the bottom of the
Pacific Ocean. No decision has been made on whether to spend
millions of dollars to retrieve the door.
   The hearing is to gather information for the NTSB report, which
will be released months from now in Washington, D.C.
   During the highly technical testimony, Doll also admitted that
some United ground crews had used power tools to operate cargo
doors even though The Boeing Co. has recommended against using such
tools.
   He said sworn documents from ground crews indicated power tools
were not used on the cargo door of the ill-fated plane in the
months prior to the accident.
   Doll's comments were made the same day United announced in
Chicago that it was ordering as much as $15.7 billion worth of new
Boeing jetliners.
   Since 1987, when a cargo door partially opened on a Pan Am 747
flying out of London, the FAA has required that lock mechanisms of
all 747s be visually inspected for signs of wear, said United
spokesman Robert Doughty.
   The company inspected all 31 of its 747s and found no problems,
Doughty said.
   The rules also required that some older aluminum lock mechanisms
be reinforced with steel, he said. United wanted to get a jump on
the extensive reinforcing work on 21 of its older 747s, and went
ahead with it based on a preliminary document, Doughty said.
   However, the work had not been completed on the plane involved
in the accident, United officials have said.
   United apparently did not see a later FAA directive requiring
new inspections of all cargo doors that had to be operated manually
because of problems with the electrical closing systems, Doughty
said.
   The ill-fated plane had electrical closing system problems
during flights over the Pacific in December, and the door was
operated manually for more than a week before repairs were made in
Chicago, the company said.
   United failed to again inspect the locking mechanism and the
plane made 130 successful flights before the accident occurred,
Doughty said.
   United officials discovered their error several weeks ago when
they were going over paperwork to prepare for the NTSB hearing, he
said. ``It's really unclear what implication this had to the whole
thing,'' Doughty said.
   Doll said the ill-fated plane did not have a history of unusual
cargo door problems, and that United recorded a total of 112
problems with forward and aft cargo doors in its 747s between March
1986 and February 1989. Eight of those were on the ill-fated plane,
but other 747s reported more problems, he said.
   ``I would not call the cargo door a maintenance problem,'' Doll
said.
   Doll also told investigators that the company had authorized use
of some power tools with limited output because it found that it
reduced damage to locking mechanisms during manual opening and
closing of the cargo door.
   Boeing has recommended against such use.

   New York's highest court waded into a
dispute over what is a family Wednesday as it heard a homosexual
man's appeal to keep the rent-controlled apartment he shared for a
decade with his late lover.
   The case being argued before the state Court of Appeals revolves
around New York City's tight and pricy housing market and the
question of whether people in non-traditional living arrangements _
homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexuals _ have the same
protection as married couples and relatives.
   When Leslie Blanchard died in 1986, his name was on the lease to
the apartment he and Miguel Braschi shared on Manhattan's East Side.
   Braschi says he deserves to keep the apartment, with its
government-controlled rent, because he and Blanchard considered
each other spouses. Their friends considered the apartment the home
of ``any happily married couple,'' according to court papers.
   Braschi, 33, said the men exchanged bracelets in 1977 as a
symbol of their commitment. He now wears both. Blanchard was about
10 years older than Braschi.
   Blanchard, who had hired Braschi to run his successful Manhattan
beauty salon, left his lover $5 million.
   Since Blanchard's death, Braschi has been fighting eviction. The
landlord, Stahl Associates Co., maintains Braschi wasn't a member
of Blanchard's ``traditional family unit ... those related by
blood, marriage or adoption.''
   Under New York City's rent-control law, leases can pass from
parent to child or spouse to spouse.
   Braschi has argued that as a ``family member'' he should have
automatic rights to the apartment even though his name wasn't on
the lease.
   ``What we're talking about is a family member,'' William
Rubenstein, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing
Braschi, told New York's top court. ``What we're asking for is no
different from what any other family member would get.''
   But lawyers for the landlord said no provisions were in the rent
control law to protect ``surviving gay life partners'' from
eviction.
   ``His (Braschi's) grievance is really with the law, which
prohibited him and Mr. Blanchard from marrying,'' Dean Yuzek,
Stahl's lawyer, told the court.
   If Braschi were evicted, Stahl could raise the rent
significantly for the apartment to ``fair market value.''
   Braschi pays about $700 a month for the one-bedroom apartment
near the East River on East 54th Street, according to his lawyers.
Actual market value in that section of Manhattan could be hundreds
of dollars higher.
   Braschi's departure also would make it easier for the landlord
to convert the building into more lucrative cooperatives.
   ``We're talking about the right to charge fair market rent for
an apartment that is currently occupied by a person who has just
inherited $5 million,'' Yuzek said after Wednesday's court hearing.
   If Braschi is allowed to stay, his rent increases would be
restricted to 6 percent annually on a one-year lease or 9 percent
on a two-year lease by the city's rent-control law.
   Stahl's lawyers have accused Braschi of trying to turn the case
into a referendum on homosexual rights.
   But ACLU attorney Nan Hunter said the landlord wanted to create
that impression ``to prejudice the atmosphere'' and that the case
is simply about family rights.
   New York's lower courts have disagreed on the case. A
trial-level judge halted the eviction, citing the ``time, love and
commitment given by Braschi to Blanchard.'' But the judge was
overturned on appeal.
   Braschi has been allowed to stay in the apartment while the case
makes its way through the courts.
   Gay rights activists have called the case the most important in
the nation dealing with non-traditional living arrangements.
   ``The case is about individuals who live in families that vary
from the Ozzie and Harriet mold,'' said Thomas Stoddard, executive
director of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a national gay rights
organization.
   Stoddard said the Court of Appeals' decision _ not expected
until June _ could be applied to numerous other social areas where
the term ``family'' is crucial, such things as group health
insurance, hospital visitation and inheritances.
   New York's Court of Appeals ruled in 1984 that one member of a
homosexual couple couldn't adopt the other to keep from being
evicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to live
together.

   An Exxon tanker carrying more than 22 million
gallons of Alaskan crude oil lost power and drifted off the
Washington coast for nearly seven hours Wednesday before it was
taken in tow.
   The 810-foot Exxon Philadelphia had drifted to the northwest,
away from land, in an area without reefs and in water 600 feet deep
with calm seas and mild winds, Coast Guard Andre Billeaudeaux said.
   A tugboat began towing the vessel to Port Angeles for repairs
shortly after 3 p.m., Billeaudeaux said. The trip should take about
20 hours.
   The single-hulled tanker was about nine miles off Cape Flattery
and 12 miles west of the entrance to the Strait of Juan de Fuca
when a boiler tube failed about 8:30 a.m., shutting down the
propulsion system, said Joe Tucker of Exxon in Valdez, Alaska. The
crew of 20 never was in danger, Tucker said.
   The incident occurred less than a month after the tanker Exxon
Valdez ran aground March 24 near Valdez, dumping 11.2 million
gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound.
   The Philadelphia, built in 1970, underwent a shipyard inspection
one month ago, Tucker said.
   The tanker left the Alaska pipeline terminus at Valdez early
Sunday for a non-Exxon refinery in Anacortes, about 65 miles north
of Seattle, said Tucker and John Ratterman of Alyeska Pipeline
Service Co. in Anchorage.
   It carried 532,862 barrels of oil, or 22.38 gallons, according
to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation in Valdez.
   One or two tankers a day make the journey from Valdez to
Anacortes.

   The Soviet Union and the United States
traded charges of hypocrisy, lies and bad faith Wednesday in one of
their most acrimonious public exchanges about Afghanistan before
the Security Council.
   Ambassador Patricia Byrne, U.S. representative to the council,
and Soviet Ambassador Alexander M. Belonogov, council president
this month, clashed over the issue of U.S. and Pakistani support to
Afghan rebels and Soviet support to the Kabul government.
   Each side accused the other of violating the U.N.-mediated
Geneva accords agreeing to non-interference in the affairs of
Afghanistan and Pakistan. The United States and the Soviet Union
were co-guarantors.
   ``It is the height, or depth of hypocrisy for the representative
of the Soviet Union to claim that the regime in Kabul and the
U.S.S.R. are fulfilling their obligations under the Geneva accords,
and that the United States and Pakistan have failed to do so,''
Ambassador Byrne told the council.
   Belonogov responded: ``As for the nonparliamentary response by
the United States about lies and hypocrisy, it seems to me that the
world community ... has formed a very clear idea about who is
hypocritical and who has been lying in this hall.''
   The council held its seventh meeting in more than two weeks to
hear Afghanistan's complaint that Pakistan is violating the
agreements by arming and training Afghan rebels, sending their arms
to Afghanistan and deploying its own army, intelligence services,
logistics units and militia to fight the Afghan army.
   Pakistan denied the charges, but Ambassador S. Shah Nawaz, in a
scathing speech, would not say from where the arms came or how they
were transported to Afghanistan.
   The United States is known to supply the rebels with Stinger and
Blowpipe missiles and other arms. The Soviet Union supplies the
Kabul government with Scud missiles and other sophisticated weapons.
   The meeting was adjourned without a date being set for another
meeting. No vote or statement was expected.
   Pakistan, which openly aides the Moslem, anti-government rebels,
says it is not directly involved in the conflict. Afghanistan and
the Soviet Union have cited numerous alleged instances of Pakistan
sending armed men and weapons into Afghanistan.
   The Afghan rebels were not party to the Geneva accords and have
rejected it. The Soviet Union has called on the United States to
agree to a joint cut-off in aid to their respective sides, but
Washington has refused.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in 1979 to help the Marxist
government battle the Moslem rebels. More than 100,000 Soviet
soldiers were in the country before the withdrawal began in May
1988. The last soldiers left in February.
   Earlier, Pakistan, responding to an Afghan threat, warned the
Security Council it would retaliate against any Afghan aggression
and accused the Soviet Union and Kabul of turning Afghanistan into
a new ``killing fields.''
   U.S. Ambassador Herbert S. Okun, the acting permanent U.N.
representative, told the council: ``The Kabul regime is desperately
clinging to power by force of arms _ through extensive and ongoing
imports of foreign (Soviet) arms _ against the will of the vast
majority of its people.''
   He said the current debate has not furthered either the cause of
peace or the self-determination of the Afghan people.
   ``It is ridiculous to expect the Afghan people to accept as
their freely chosen leader a former secret police chief (Najib) who
was installed by a foreign power,'' Okun said.
   ``The Kabul regime, even with outside help, will inevitably fail
... Pakistan is not and never has been the aggressor.''

   Actor Gale Gordon, a sidekick of
Lucille Ball from radio days who appeared with her in three
television series, recalled on Wednesday how the comedian never
thought of herself as particularly funny.
   ``Oh, but when she told a story or recalled an event that
happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face,''
the 83-year-old Gordon said in a telephone interview. ``She never
saw it, but she was extremely amusing.''
   Gordon, who is appearing in a play in Edmonton, spent the day in
an Edmonton hotel room, mourning the death of Lucille Ball in a Los
Angeles hospital Wednesday at age 77 and quietly remembering his
funny friend.
   ``The world will miss her greatly,'' the actor said. ``I
personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the
world ... a wonderful, warm friend and a bit of a genius _ the only
one I've ever really known.''
   In his first television series alongside Miss Ball, Gordon was
the flustered banker Mr. Mooney in ``The Lucy Show'' from 1962-68.
The next six years saw him as Harrison Carter on ``Here's Lucy.''
   They were reunited briefly in 1986 for the short-lived ``Life
With Lucy.''
   Gordon first met Miss Ball in 1947 on the radio program ``My
Favorite Husband,'' which later became ``I Love Lucy'' on
television.
   ``I thought she was a very good-looking young woman, and very
talented,'' he recalled. ``She was very pleasant to work with. None
of us knew what was going to happen _ television was very young
then and it wasn't taken too seriously. We never dreamed it would
ever become the power it was ... and the great stars it would
produce.''
   Gordon last spoke to Miss Ball from Edmonton on his birthday,
Feb. 20, when ``she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has
done for years and years.''
   Gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of
Edmonton-based dinner theatres called Stage West. He is currently
appearing with that company's Mayfair Dinner Theatre as a priest in
the play ``Mass Appeal.''
   The play has another month to run and Gordon says that means he
won't be able to attend Miss Ball's funeral.
   ``I couldn't do that because it would put people out of work,''
he said. ``She would be the first one to scream her head off if I
did that.''

   About 20 armed Colombians infiltrated
Venezuelan territory and attacked a military patrol Wednesday,
killing one national guardsman and wounding three, military
spokesmen said.
   Gen. Fernando Ochoa, national guard commander in Maracaibo, said
the attack occurred outside a national guard post at Mata de Coco,
about 400 miles west of the capital city of Caracas, at 7 a.m.
   He said authorities were not certain if the men were bandits or
guerrillas.
   ``Whoever they were, they stole five automatic FAL rifles,''
Ochoa said.
   The Belgian-made rifles are used by the Venezuelan military.
   Ochoa said military patrols were combing the area looking for
the assailants.
   Mata de Coco is on the Colombian-Venezuelan border. Venezuelan
forces accuse the Colombian gunmen of kidnapping local cattle
ranchers and sabotaging oil installations.

   Vice President Dan Quayle on Thursday
challenged the Soviet Union to move from ``rhetoric to reality'' by
taking concrete steps to lessen military tensions in the Pacific.
   Quayle, in his first major address since arriving here less than
24 hours ago, said communism has failed and the world's democracies
must ``capitalize on this triumph.''
   ``We should, because we are strong and prudent, continue to ask
hard questions such as when are the Soviets going to move their
troops out of the northern territories of Japan,'' Quayle said in
remarks prepared for delivery to the National Press Club.
   ``When are the Soviets going to stop providing more modern arms
to North Korea and when will the Soviets actually decrease rather
than increase their military aid to Hanoi to promote peace in
Southeast Asia?'' Quayle said.
   Quayle's first trip to the Pacific comes against a backdrop of
the upcoming Sino-Soviet summit. Next month Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev travels to China for the first summit between the two
countries in 20 years.
   But Quayle said, ``We must challenge the Soviets to move from
rhetoric to reality, from pledges about tension reduction to real
tension-reducing measures.''
   On Thursday, Quayle met with Australian Defense Minister Kim
Beazley and Australia's foreign affairs minister, Gareth Evans.
   Earlier, the vice president held a 90-minute session with Prime
Minister Bob Hawke at which the two discussed economic and defense
issues and the common strains with New Zealand.
   In his speech, Quayle said any minor economic frictions should
not be allowed to harm the strong alliance that has developed
between the United States and Australia.
   The two discussed New Zealand's threat to withdraw from the
ANZUS Council as well as economic issues, according to U.S. and
Australian officials who briefed reporters but refused to be quoted
by name.
   Quayle's visit, timed to coincide with Australian-American
Friendship Week, comes at a time when the relationship between the
allies is in ``excellent shape,'' the Australian official said. He
categorized the discussions as ``very friendly indeed,'' and said
the two might try to hold additional talks before Quayle leaves the
city on Thursday.
   Of concern to the leaders, however, was the threat by New
Zealand Prime Minister David Lange to withdraw from the
Australian-New Zealand-U.S. defense alliance, known as ANZUS. Lange
made his comments in the United States earlier this week.
   New Zealand has been excluded from the ANZUS Council since Lange
announced in 1984 that his government would not allow nuclear ships
to visit New Zealand ports. However, that country has not formally
withdrawn from the ministerial council.
   Quayle raised the issue of New Zealand in an attempt to gauge
the seriousness of New Zealand's threat, but Hawke was unable to
tell him whether Lange's speech amounted to a fundamental shift in
New Zealand policy, the U.S. and Australian officials said.
   Hawke also talked about initiatives for greater Pacific regional
cooperation on economic matters, ones that Quayle said the United
States supported, the officials said.
   The vice president also told Hawke that the U.S. decision to
subsidize grain exports was not designed to hurt Australia. The
Australians have complained that such subsidies hurt their wheat
exports.

<HEAD>Authorities Round up Eskimos at Anti-NATO Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOOSE BAY, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Military and federal police
dragged about 50 Eskimos from a runway at an air base Wednesday to
break up a protest against low-level NATO flights, a military
spokesman said.
   For the past seven months, the Eskimos have mounted a series of
such protests at the Goose Bay air base, which they say is built on
their ancestral hunting grounds.
   The Innu Eskimos got onto the base Wednesday by cutting through
a gate, said Lt. Col. Robert Jodoin, a Canadian Forces spokesman.
He said the men, women, and children then fanned out across a
runway, yelling, ``We don't want NATO!''
   They were herded into military buses and police cars. The chief
of the local Innu, Daniel Ashini, was among those rounded up, a
spokesman for the protesters said on condition of anonymity.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police could not say afterward how
many demostrators were kept in custody.
   Those arrested will be charged under military regulations with
trespassing, Jodoin said.
   The demonstration followed last week's acquittal by a provincial
court of four Eskimos who were charged with public mischief for
protesting last fall at the base on this Canadian island province
in the Atlantic Ocean.
   In his landmark ruling, Judge James Igloliorte cleared the four
on the basis that they honestly believe the ground where the base
is located belongs to the Eskimos.
   The Eskimos say the low-level flights are turning their
ancestral hunting grounds into a war zone. The North Atlantic
Treaty Organization flights are made by Canada, West Germany,
Britain, and the Netherlands.
   The military says the Eskimos are using the protests to pressure
the government in longstanding territorial disputes.

   Three senior members of the Senate Iran-Contra
investigating committee asked Wednesday for an congressional
intelligence committee probe into why the panel did not receive
crucial Reagan administration documents that have come out at the
trial of Oliver North.
   An initial review by Senate staff members found that four
documents introduced as evidence in North's trial never were turned
over to congressional investigators in 1987 when they looked into
the administration's Iran arms deal and Contra support initiatives.
   Two other documents in the committee's files are similar to ones
released at the trial, but are missing important attachments or
notations.
   One document, an April 25, 1985, memo from then-National
Security Adviser Robert McFarlane, recommends that Reagan telephone
Honduran President Roberto Suazo to reassure him of U.S. backing
for the Contras. Missing from the congressional copy is the
notation, ``cc Vice President,'' apparently signaling that George
Bush was sent a copy of the memo.
   ``These six documents are sufficient to raise questions about
the procedures followed by the executive branch in providing
documents to the Iran-Contra Committee and the completeness of its
compliance with agreements on the provision of documents,'' said a
letter asking for the investigation.
   The request was sent to Sens. David Boren, D-Okla., and William
Cohen, R-Maine, chairman and vice chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, and was signed by Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Sens. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., the chairman and vice chairman of the
Iran-Contra panel.
   President Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, told reporters
aboard Air Force One on Wednesday, ``We will cooperate in any way
we can, but otherwise we don't know much about it.
   ``This doesn't involve us directly,'' Fitzwater said. ``This is
between the senators and the intelligence committee. They're
looking into the last administration's procedures and it doesn't
relate to us. It's an internal matter for the Senate to look into.''
   White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray, in a letter to Mitchell,
said his office had contacted Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr., who was
Reagan's counsel during much of the time at issue, and that
Culvahouse has offered to review the matter and informally brief
the senators.
   ``We have confidence that the last administration followed the
agreed procedures (for releasing the material) and that its
representatives will be able to address your concerns,'' Gray's
letter said. ``We, of course endeavor to be as helpful as we
can...''
   Boren, in a statement, promised to ``look at this matter
expeditiously and in a businesslike, non-political manner.''
   The letter said some of the documents contain key evidence about
the way U.S. officials conducted policy in Central America in 1985
``and raise questions regarding ... possible efforts to circumvent
the provisions of the law'' which barred direct or indirect U.S.
aid to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   A similar request was made two weeks ago by Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind., who was chairman of the House Iran-Contra committee. An
aide to Hamilton said Wednesday that he had not yet received a
response to his request of White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.
   The congressional committees, after an extensive investigation,
concluded that a ``cabal of ... zealots'' in the Reagan
administration seized control of policy in the affair which sent
weapons to Iran and profits from the sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.
   But documents and testimony during the North trial suggest that
senior officials up to and including Reagan and then-vice president
George Bush were more involved in the affair than the committees
knew.
   Among documents which the congressional panels did not receive
were a Feb. 19, 1985, memo outlining a plan to step up U.S. aid to
Honduras in return for that nation's support of the Contras, and a
memo dated the following day making it clear that the
administration knew it was forbidden from providing aid under those
circumstances.
   Also not turned over to congressional investigators was an Oct.
30, 1985, memo from North to McFarlane about reconnaissance of
Nicaragua and mentioning the air drop of two recoilless rifles to
the rebels.
   Mark Belnick, a New York attorney who was on the staff of the
Senate panel, said the documents clearly should have been sent in
response to congressional requests and would have been helpful in
the investigation. But he added, ``If this is the sum and
substance, ... they wouldn't have materially changed any of the
conclusions'' reached by investigators.

   She was nervous, like thousands of young women who have gone
before her.
   Still, the 23-year-old woman made final arrangements Wednesday
for her abortion at the St. Louis clinic that challenged Missouri's
restrictions on the procedure.
   She said she was afraid the showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court
``might change things.''
   ``I wanted the services to be available to me legally,'' said
the woman, who asked that her name not be used. ``My finances won't
let me have another child. I think I should have the right to
choose.''
   While the tension at the Reproductive Health Services clinic was
subdued, thousands of protesters from California to Connecticut
staged demonstrations on both sides of the issue.
   ``This is a monumental day of reckoning for women's lives in the
U.S.,'' Victoria Lambert said in Atlanta, where about 800
pro-choice demonstrators marched at the Georgia Capitol.
   The St. Louis clinic initiated the case of Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services by challenging restrictions in
Missouri's abortion law. The Supreme Court could use its ruling in
the case to tighten or even overturn its landmark 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision legalizing abortion.
   ``There were more concerns in the waiting room this morning,''
said Amelia McCracken, the clinic's director of community
education. ``There is an awareness, an edge today that I haven't
seen previously.''
   The increasingly bitter debate has made it even more difficult
for women coming to the clinic to make a decision, said Jody Sova,
director of counseling at the clinic.
   ``Abortion has always been a very serious, difficult choice for
women,'' Sova said. ``Anytime something like this is fought over in
public, it adds to the difficulty.''
   In Sacramento, Calif., about 2,000 pro-choice demonstrators
rallied at the state capitol as a half-dozen abortion opponents
rallied nearby.
   Placard-carrying abortion foes approached the rally, but were
surrounded by poster-toting pro-choice demonstrators. State police
separated the two groups, then stayed between them throughout the
protest.
   ``This is not a women's issue,'' actor Tim Busfield, who plays
Elliot Weston on ABC's ``thirtysomething,'' told the pro-choice
rally. ``It's a family issue. It's a human rights issue.''
   Nola Jones, who said she had two abortions before becoming an
abortion foe, told reporters that ``abortion is a major death
experience. Women cannot participate in the death of their own
child and not be psychologically impaired.''
   In Baton Rouge, La., state Rep. Woody Jenkins introduced a bill
declaring abortion centers public nuisances in the event the high
court overturns Roe vs. Wade.
   Jenkins, a Democrat, has drafted most of the state anti-abortion
laws that parallel Missouri's.
   In Raleigh, N.C., more than 800 pro-choice demonstrators shouted
slogans and carried white coat hangers dipped in red paint to
symbolize back-alley abortions.
   About 300 people attended a pro-choice rally at the University
of California at Berkeley in the culmination of an on-campus vigil
that has been going on for days.
   Rallies were also held in Albany, N.Y.; at Yale Law School in
New Haven, Conn.; Columbus, Ohio; and Fort Wayne, Ind.
   Operation Rescue, which has mounted a series of major
anti-abortion protests aimed at blocking access to clinics, is
planning protests in 65 cities Friday and Saturday, said
spokeswoman Barbara Magera in Binghamton, N.Y.
   She said the group would work for a ``human life amendment'' to
the Constitution, and would seek bans on abortion in individual
states in the event the Supreme Court overturns Roe vs. Wade.

   Stomachaches and stress are plaguing many
Alaska natives who live off the sea and have lost their traditional
diet of fish and seal meat because of the Exxon oil spill.
   Native people, warned about contamination in Prince William
Sound, have had to turn to beef, chicken and canned luncheon meat
for protein.
   ``It takes the body a while to adapt to eating that stuff,''
Gary Kompkoff, president of the village council in Tatitlek, said
Wednesday. ``There are a lot of problems with it, a lot of diarrhea
and stomachaches.''
   Tatitlek is 28 miles from Valdez and eight miles from where the
tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24.
   Meantime, a break in the weather sent crews back to cleaning up
the oil on Alaska's coastline and the governor urged Congress to
buy back oil leases in a rich fishing bay. A federal judge also
consolidated 27 civil cases already filed against Exxon Corp.,
owner of the tanker that ran aground and caused the nation's worst
oil spill.
   Gov. Steve Cowper, noting the oil spill's effects in Prince
William Sound, said that such an enviromental disaster in Bristol
Bay, which oil companies have paid the federal government $114.7
million for the right to explore, ``is unthinkable.''
   ``It is time to cancel the sale and refund the bid money,'' he
said.
   Skimmers were deployed across the Gulf of Alaska coastline and
around the southern tip of Kenai Peninsula to Homer. The giant
Soviet skimmer was deployed near Seward.
   Exxon, which is responsible for the estimated 11.2 million
gallon oil spill, has begun sending food shipments to Tatitlek,
Chenega Bay, Port Graham and English Bay.
   The Alaska Division of Subsistence is working on ways to help
people in those villages resume their traditional diets as oil from
the nation's worst spill continues to pollute sections of the south
central Alaska coast.
   Slackening weather enabled some crews to resume cleanup in the
sound, and the Navy transport USS Juneau left Valdez with 200
workers who will scrub oil off hard-hit beaches on Smith and
Eleanor islands.
   However, the disposal of 14,000 pounds of waste accumulated in
the cleanup still hasn't been resolved, and the state is concerned
the dispute points to more problems with an oil consortium's plans
to clean future oil spills.
   The state Department of Envirnomental Conservation wants the
waste burned at the consortium's incinerator in Valdez.
   However, Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. says its incinerator has
been working around the clock and its facilities can't hold any
more broken booms and oily absorbent pads.
   ``It seems like Alyeska doesn't want to be readily involved in
this,'' said Jeff Mach of the environmental agency.
   ``This continues to be a matter of commitments that were made
with regards to how the trans-Alaska pipleine system was to be
operated ...,'' Mach said.
   The spill has disrupted normal operations all over the sound.
   One possible exception is the salmon hatcheries, which are
releasing millions of fry this week as plankton _ a food source for
the young fish _ reaches its peak bloom.
   Jack Lamb, vice president of the fishermen's union Cordova
District Fishermen United, said salmon will be caught and tested
for oil contamination before the scheduled May 15 opening of the
Copper River salmon harvest.
   For the natives in Tatitlek, the spill has affected more than
their diet.
   It has cast their way of life into turmoil as seasonal routines
associated with gathering and preserving food are thrown off,
council president Kompkoff said.
   ``We've been set in our ways for so many years. There's a lot of
stress, a lot of worry about what the future holds for us,'' he
said.
   Robert Wolfe, research director for the state Division of
Subsistence, said this is a critical time for harvests.
   ``This is the time of year when major food resources arrive and
are put up for the year,'' he said.
   Harvests of herring and herring roe already have been missed
because of the spill. And collection of shellfish such as clams
also has been disrupted, he said.
   There are concerns the salmon harvest that begins in mid-May and
provides about one-third of the subsistence food supply will be
affected, as well.
   ``No residents here have been able to harvest anything,''
Kompkoff said. Many of their boats have been hired by Exxon to help
with the cleanup.
   An Exxon contractor has sent two shipments of food to Tatitlek
and one each to Chenega Bay, English Bay and Port Graham since
distributions began May 14, said Judy Meidinger, rural affairs
specialist for the oil company.
   Fish has been requested and likely will be provided in future
shipments, she said.
   Some people are uncomfortable with the idea of food being sent
in, Kompkoff said.
   ``We get this oil spill and Exxon thinks it can replace our
subsistence resources by sending food,'' he said. ``They can't.''
   Meidinger said Exxon's program is intended to help people
through difficult times while work to deal with effects of the oil
spill is under way.
   ``I think that's appropriate,'' she said.

<HEAD>Pinochet Asks For Resignation of Cabinet</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Right-wing military President Augusto
Pinochet asked for the resignation of all 15 of his Cabinet members
Wednesday to allow changes in some posts, a government spokesman
said.
   The measure coincided with local media reports that Gen.
Pinochet had disagreements with his interior minister, Carlos
Caceres, over proposed democratic reforms.
   No official explanation was given for the shake-up, however. The
government declined to say what portfolios would be changed.
   It is customary in Chile for all Cabinet ministers to hand in
letters of resignation even when only one or two changes are
planned.
   The government spokesman, army Gen. Jaime Garcia, told
journalists at the government palace that the resignations were
requested at a 70-minute meeting of Pinochet and his full Cabinet
late in the day.
   ``He expressed his intention of making changes in the current
Cabinet,'' Garcia said. He said Pinochet ``is evaluating the
current political situation'' and asked all government ministers to
hand in their resignations so the president would have ``freedom of
action.''
   Garcia did not say when the changes would be announced. ``There
is no date yet for swearing in the new Cabinet,'' Garcia said.
   According to some local news reports, Pinochet and Caceres have
differed over proposed amendments to the country's 1980
constitution and other legal reforms.
   According to the reports, Caceres wants to allow several
democratic reforms sought by opposition political groups before
scheduled Dec. 14 national elections to pick a successor to
Pinochet and a Congress. Pinochet has said he will remain army
commander after the elections.
   Pinochet, who seized power in a violent 1973 coup, was forced to
call the elections when he lost a yes-or-no referendum last October
on a proposal to extend his rule to 1997.

   The government of Okinawa has decided to move the
proposed site of an airport to protect a rare blue coral reef,
officials announced Wednesday.
   The government of the Japanese prefecture, changing a 7-year-old
plan, decided to build the new airport 2.5 miles north of the
original site on the east coast of Ishigaki Island, Japanese
Environment Agency official Masaaki Sakurai said.The location is
1,140 miles southeast of Tokyo.
   Okinawa Governor Junji Nishime said the regional government
chose the new site as the best alternative to protect the coral
reef.
   Environmentalists had warned that under the original plan, the
coral would have been buried in concrete. They said there are about
130 species of coral in the reef.

   Players drove, flew, took the train and
walked to the nearest Pennsylvania lottery ticket counter up to the
last minute Wednesday before the winning North American record
jackpot of more than $100 million was drawn.
   The official winning numbers were 06; 16; 24; 34; 35; 37; 40;
41; 45; 60; 71. A winning ticket must have seven of the 11 numbers
drawn.
   James Scroggins, the lottery's executive director, said the
prize would be ``something higher than $100 million when it's all
said and done.''
   How much higher won't be known until sometime Thursday, but
unofficial estimates have put the jackpot at more than $110 million.
   Thursday also is the earliest it will will be known whether
there is a jackpot winner, said lottery spokesman George Anderson.
And it won't be until Friday when the number of winners, if any, is
known, officials have said.
   ``We are now running the computer to go through all 87 million
transactions in an attempt to identify if there are any winners,''
Anderson said, referring to the $87.3 million worth of tickets sold
since last Thursday.
   The huge jackpot set off a lottery mania. Players took planes
and trains from around the country to join in the buying frenzy.
   ``Being frivolous, it was worth it. Being conservative, I
could've found better things to do with my money,'' said Irene
Tasca, of Philadelphia. ``No one at work concentrated on work for
the past two days.''
   At the Penn-Ohio Drug Store in Sharon, night supervisor Debbie
Trinckes, of Hubbard, Ohio, said there were 75 to 100 people in
line trying to buy tickets when the machine closed for the drawing.
   ``We kept going out and telling them they weren't going to make
it,'' she said. ``Some left, but some stayed. Most were from
out-of-town.''
   In an average week, the state usually sells about 4 million or 5
million tickets, but on Tuesday alone about 24 million tickets were
sold, said Karl Ross, deputy revenue secretary. From 6 a.m. to 11
a.m. Wednesday, about 7 million tickets were sold. Players came
from all over the country.
   But lottery officials considered the nightmarish possibility
that no one would win Wednesday night's Super 7 drawing.
   The odds of any one ticket bearing seven winning numbers is one
in 9.6 million. With more than 74 million tickets sold in the last
week, and the jackpot rolled over because of no winner in six
previous drawings, Ross said the odds are about 4,000-to-1 against
another rollover.
   Although a winner or winners could come forward, lottery
officials said that because of the high volume of sales they
wouldn't know for certain until sometime Friday if a winning ticket
had been sold or how many had been sold. They said the computer
would give them a preliminary indication Thursday afternoon, but
that it would take another day to complete backup reviews of ticket
numbers.
   If there is a rollover, next week's jackpot could approach $200
million, payable over 26 years, and some lottery agents would run
out of tickets.
   ``We couldn't handle another week like this, selling all these
tickets, without having spot shortages,'' Ross said in a telephone
interview. As a precaution, he said, the lottery was lining up
vendors to do emergency printing runs if necessary.
   ``We're in a brave new world, uncharted waters,'' Ross said. If
a rollover occurred and the jackpot soared beyond $150 million, he
added, ``I think the atmosphere would be even weirder.''
   At least one vendor also hoped against another rollover.
   ``I've already told my customers not to come in if there isn't a
winner tonight,'' said Theresa Donavich, owner of Theresa's Cards
and News in Burgettstown, near the Pennsylvania-West Virginia-Ohio
border.
   ``I'm locking the doors and I'm leaving town until after next
Thursday,'' she joked. Vendors receive 5 cents for each $1 ticket
they sell.
   She said a constable and police officer were posted in the
store, in part to alleviate her fear of being robbed, because of
extra money from ticket sales.
   ``I've been terrified to stay in my own home for fear of
somebody breaking in and demanding money, even though I don't keep
it there.''
   But if state officials and vendors were wearing out, players
weren't. Lines of a dozen people or more were reported at most
establishments and ticket sales were still brisk.
   The volume prompted the state to press into service about 100
spare machines that are usually kept in reserve.
   At Rainbow Entertainment, in a shopping mall near the Capitol,
only about six people waited in line, including Paulita Vidot, a
Harrisburg housewife who planned to buy one ticket. She laughed
guiltily when her husband spied her in line, explaining, ``This is
my first time. Usually I give him a hard time for playing ... I
just wanted to say I participated.''
   Also in line was Kathy Bohensky, a federal clerk who said she
didn't believe in lotteries but was buying five tickets.
   ``I don't feel one person should get $100 million,'' she said.
``These are for my grandfather. He's hooked. I'd like to see him
win. He's very, very sick. (The jackpot) could go towards his
medical expenses.''
   Even Linda Despot and Donald Woomer, winners of the previous
Pennsylvania record jackpot of $46 million, bought a piece of the
action.
   Woomer, of Hollidaysburg, said he bought $100 worth of tickets,
but mostly for fun and not really in hope of winning.
   ``Nobody would want to play anymore if we won again,'' he said
with a laugh.

   An American professor drowned when
floodwaters swept his four-wheel drive vehicle from a bridge over a
raging river, police said Thursday.
   Steve Johnson, 41, a former resident of Pawling, N.Y., was
trapped on the roof of his vehicle before being swept away
Wednesday by the rising waters of the swollen Little Nerang River.
   The vehicle apparently had stalled on the bridge, police said
Thursday. They later reported finding his body.
   Johnson was a professor at the Law and Business School at Bond
University in the Gold Coast region of Queensland state.
   Witnesses said fast-rising floodwaters had forced Johnson out of
his vehicle. They said they watched as he stood on the roof of the
vehicle, but were unable to reach him.
   ``We were hoping he would grab onto a tree or something,'' said
Kerry Anstey, an eyewitness. ``We saw him dragged under into a deep
hole in the creek. He surfaced again, then disappeared.''
   Johnson's vehicle later was discovered two miles downstream,
near where the body was discovered.
   Johnson was previously the coordinator of doctoral programs in
accounting at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania
and at the Graduate School of Business of Columbia University in
New York, said Bond University spokesman Professor Don Watts. He
was married and had two children.
   Johnson was the second victim of bad weather that produced wild
storms and heavy seas along Queensland's southeast coast Tuesday
and Wednesday.
   A man was electrocuted Tuesday night north of Brisbane after
trying to start a generator during a blackout. Power lines were

<HEAD>First Official Soviet Visit In 33 Years</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Soviet diplomat arrived here
Wednesday to discuss a troubled peace plan for Namibia in what was
the first official visit to South Africa approved by Moscow in 33
years.
   The Soviet Union broke relations with South Africa in 1956 over
its racial policies. Since then, the two countries have had direct
dealings only in a few international agencies and in cartels
dealing with diamonds and gold.
   Security men taped a small cardboard Soviet flag to the
windshield of a limousine that carried Soviet official Vyacheslav
Ustinov away from D.F. Malan Airport after he was greeted by Neil
van Heerden, director-general of the South Africa Foreign Affairs
Department.
   He arrived on the same plane carrying the U.S. delegation to the
talks, which also involve Cuba, Angola and South Africa. The
discussions are part of regularly scheduled meetings of the Joint
Monitoring Commission, set up to monitor an agreement that provided
for withdrawal of Cuban and South African troops from Angola and
independence for the South African-controlled territory of Namibia.
   The plan was disrupted on April 1 when hundreds of South-West
Africa People's Organization guerrillas crossed the border from
Angola into northern Namibia, instead of waiting to return in
mid-May, unarmed, as outlined in the agreement.
   More than 300 men have been killed in the fighting, and South
African officials have said that U.N. Resolution 435, the
independence plan for Namibia, might be in jeopardy if the SWAPO
guerrillas do not leave the territory.
   South Africa has said its forces will be confined to their bases
in northern Namibia from Wednesday evening through Saturday morning
to give the SWAPO guerrillas a chance to return to Angola
unhindered.
   Ustinov, making his first trip to South Africa, ruled out the
possibility of any talks with the South Africans except on the
subject of Namibia and Angola.
   ``If you mean bilateral talks in the sense of having some
political or other relations, I have no intention of this at the
present time,'' he told a news conference.
   The U.S. delegation was led by Chas W. Freeman, Jr., acting U.S.
assistant secretary of state for African affairs.

   A man who officials say used bogus
resumes and references to land government jobs across the country
was ordered Wednesday to serve 90 days in jail and pay $18,000 in
restitution to an Alaska village.
   Carl Keyser Jr., 34, was sentenced on a first-degree theft
charge stemming from his brief tenure as Kake city administrator
last year. He pleaded no contest to the felony charge, which
alleged he took $28,000 in salary, benefits and expenses before he
was fired in December.
   Superior Court Judge Thomas Schultz placed Keyser on probation
for seven years, ordered him not to accept any government job
during that time and gave him credit for 60 days of jail time
already served.
   Schultz rejected Keyser's request to be freed without additional
jail time, and ordered him to write lettrs of apology to the towns
of Kake and Pikeville, Ky., as well as serve the final 30 days of
the sentence.
   ``This is pretty reprehensible conduct,'' the judge said of
Keyser's employment record.
   District Attorney Mark Ells said he will dismiss a
theft-by-deception charge filed against Keyser by officials in
Pikeville, where Keyser was employed briefly as city manager in
August. Keyser sent the city $707 in restitution Tuesday, and the
Pikeville prosecutor asked to drop the charge, Ells said.
   The Pikeville restitution represented expense money Keyser was
paid before he resigned amid allegations he faked his resume.
   ``What I did here was wrong,'' said Keyser, who is married and
has four daughters. ``I lied on my resume because I needed a job to
feed my family, and instead of doing it the right way ... I took
too many shortcuts.''
   Keyser said he would move once he finished serving his time in
jail, but was unsure where. His lawyer, Mary Treiber, said Keyser
was considering a move to Seattle.
   Schultz said Keyser could move out of Petersburg, where he has
been unable to find a job since posting bail. But the judge
expressed concern that Keyser would try to get a government job
again, and ordered him to check monthly with his probation officer
in Alaska.
   ``I'm not sure that Mr. Keyser is going to be able to make the
kind of money honestly that he made lying,'' the judge said.
   Schultz did not order Keyser to pay the $28,000 in restitution
the state requested, saying Kake did get some value from his work.
   Residents of Kake, a small fishing and timber town on the
northern tip of Kupreanof Island in southeast Alaska, became
suspicious of Keyser shortly after he arrived to take the
$44,000-a-year administrator's job.
   He bought a luxurious $66,000 double mobile home, rifles and
1,000 rounds of ammunition with city money, and refused to release
his resume for public inspection.
   A check of police records revealed the outstanding Kentucky
warrant in December, and he was arrested.
   Interviews with prosecutors and city officials in several states
revealed that at least 19 of Keyser's jobs since 1980 were with
city or county governments. Records and the interviews showed
Keyser used false information to obtain at least 11 of the jobs.
   Law enforcement officials said Keyser apparently earned a living
by cashing as many salary and expense checks as he could before his
bosses became suspicious and he either quit or was fired.
   Wednesday's sentence was the second time Keyser has been
convicted of a charge stemming from his false resumes.
   Keyser, a native of Huntington, W.Va., was placed on a year's
probation after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor perjury charge in
Oak Hill, Fla. The charge alleged he used false information to get
hired as Oak Hill police chief. He was fired after four months when
the discrepancies in his resume were reported in the news media.
   Other states in which Keyser allegedly applied or obtained jobs
under false pretenses include Idaho, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas,
West Virginia and Wyoming.

<HEAD>Two Teens Indicted In Central Park Wolfpack Attack on Jogger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury Wednesday indicted two teen-age
boys in last week's Central Park ``wolf pack'' beating and gang
rape of a jogger that left the 28-year-old Wall Street investment
banker in a coma.
   Yusef Salaam, 15, and Raymond Santana, 14, are among the eight
youths charged in the attack.
   Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer told Manhattan
Criminal Court Judge Harvey Glasser that the grand jury had
returned an indictment against Salaam, but refused to give the
charges or other details.
   Ms. Lederer didn't mention Santana, but sources who spoke on
condition of anonymity said the grand jury had indicted him as well.
   Both Salaam and Santana, who was not in court, have been charged
with first-degree rape, second-degree attempted murder and
first-degree assault.
   The victim was attacked by a ``wolf pack'' of up to a dozen
youths as she jogged through the park that night. She was raped,
beaten unconscious and left for dead in underbrush, where she was
found several hours later.
   In a written confession, Salaam admitted fondling the victim and
hitting her with a pipe but denied raping her. The other seven
suspects made videotaped confessions, police say.
   Lederer's announcement complied with a law requiring that a
defendant charged with a felony be indicted within five days of his
arrest or be released on their own recognizance.
   Glasser scheduled May 10 for a bail hearing before another judge.
   Ms. Lederer told the judge additional charges would be filed
against the defendants. Robbery, rioting and assault charges have
been filed against four of the eight defendants in attacks on other
people the night of April 19.
   Indictments against the other six youths involved in the attack
were expected Thursday.
   Salaam's mother, aunt and several cousins and friends of the
family were in the courtroom Wednesday.
   Family friend Paul Friedman, a third-grade teacher at P.S. 225
in Brooklyn who tutored Salaam in math, said he would be very
surprised if the boy took part in the attack. He said Salaam was an
easy-going, artistic boy who had some learning problems.
   The victim remained in stable but critical condition one week
after the April 19 attack, said Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, head of the
surgical intensive care unit at Metropolitan Hospital. ``She still
is in a comatose state,'' he said.

   The Bush administration has agreed to assess
Exxon Corp. for oil spill damage to Alaska's natural resources
according to guidelines that already are under court challenge for
allegedly being too easy on polluters.
   The decision comes despite administration promises to seek
``complete restoration'' of losses from the Exxon Valdez tanker
spill that has fouled Alaska's wildlife-rich Prince William Sound.
   Interior Department officials acknowledged in interviews Tuesday
that the government has agreed to use guidelines giving polluters
the option of paying only the ``market value'' of resources they
destroy, rather than the cost of replacing them.
   Under the rules, for example, a seabird with little potential
for commercial exploitation might be declared to be worth just a
few dollars.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev has taken a major step toward
mastering the Communist Party's top policy-making body by easing
out a quarter of its most senior members and installing his own men.
   At a meeting of the Central Committee on Tuesday, the Soviet
president remolded the body's membership in a maneuver expected to
make it easier for him to wage his campaign for reform.
   Seventy-four of the committee's 301 full members retired,
including former President Andrei A. Gromyko and many other
holdovers from pre-Gorbachev days, and 24 people were promoted to
full membership.
   The committee also retired 24 of its non-voting members and 12
members of the Central Auditing Commission, which handles party
finance.

   ``I don't feel freedom yet,'' 53-year-old James Richardson said
Tuesday following an eight-hour hearing in the DeSoto County

   ``I guess it's going to take a while to get use to it, but I'm

   Retired Circuit Judge Clifton Kelly, assigned to review the case

by an all-white jury after agreeing with defense attorneys that
prosecutors allowed perjured testimony and withheld evidence.

   Investors who could provide the last piece of

abruptly stopped cooperating with investigators looking into how he
profited handsomely from a nonproducing gas well.
   The chairman and vice chairman of the ethics committee, who had
traveled to San Antonio, Texas, to interview businessmen involved
in the drilling venture, returned to Washington without completing
their inquiry.
   In the capital, Wright's colleagues continued to focus on
charges that he sold bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections of
a Public Man,'' to evade House limits on outside income. The
speaker said he might consider giving the profits to charity if the
ethics panel suggests it.
   Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and senior Republican John T.
Myers of Indiana declined to say whether they would seek contempt
citations against the Texas investors who spurned the committee's
subpoenas.

   Conditions shifted in U.S. society
between 1950 and 1970 and ``it is no longer natural, normal and
American to grow up Christian,'' says the Rev. William H. Willimon,
a Duke University professor.
   ``Paganism is in the air we breath and the water we drink,''
Willimon, a United Methodist, said in a lecture at Southern Baptist
Theological Seminary. ``If our children grow up in faith, we are
going to have to put them there.''
   He said the ``world has declared war on the church in the most
subtle ways.'' Therefore, he said, Christians must form strong
worshipping communities because ``being a Christian is too
difficult a way to walk alone.''

   The miniseries comes to ``Mister Rogers'
Neighborhood'' next week, and the show's cardigan-clad creator
promises a message as gentle and reassuring as ever.
   The three-part musical, titled ``Josephine the Short-Neck
Giraffe,'' tells the story of a young giraffe who yearns for a
long, graceful neck like all the other giraffes. She eventually
grows, Fred Rogers confided, ``not on the outside, but on the
important side.''
   ``It's very much like the usual message of the Neighborhood,
that you can be acceptable as you are,'' he said, smiling. ``It's
not so much the outsides of us that are important.''
   A song sung by Josephine and her friend Hazel the elephant sums
it up best, according to Rogers.
   ``You're much more than a neck, Josephine. And you're much more
than a trunk, Hazel. A chicken's more than a peck, and there's more
than a smell to a skunk,'' Rogers quietly sang during an interview
at Pittsburgh's WQED-TV, home to his children's programs for the
past 35 years.
   The special week of new programs gets under way Monday on Public
Broadcasting Service stations with a trip to the San Diego Wild
Animal Park, where viewers are introduced to real-life giraffes and
elephants. On Tuesday, Rogers visits a film processing lab to have
his animal photographs developed.
   The miniseries, which features a cast of 15, elaborate animal
costumes and five sets, runs Wednesday through Friday. Rogers
gently guides his young audience from one day to the next,
summarizing the main events and hinting at what might lie ahead for
Josephine.
   In the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, where animals sing, dance
and play the trombone, Josephine is befriended by J.R., a shy
giraffe who overcomes his problems by helping Josephine conquer
hers. He accomplishes that with help from Hazel the elephant, who
advises him to ``just let your heart speak.''
   ``There isn't a time that I see the scene in which J.R. talks
and sings with Josephine ... that I haven't gotten chills up my
spine,'' Rogers said, tapping his right hand against his back.
``And this is something I've worked with for years. There's
something so redemptive about someone who is trying so hard to help
somebody else.''
   Rogers, 61, wrote ``Josephine the Short-Neck Giraffe'' for a
French class assignment at Florida's Rollins College in 1950. He
named J.R. the giraffe after fraternity brother John Reardon, who
went on to sing with the Metropolitan Opera and was a frequent
guest on ``Mister Rogers Neighborhood.'' Reardon died a year ago,
and the miniseries is dedicated to him.
   Rogers set the story to music in the late 1950s, and about 1,000
records were pressed. Writer Barry Head transformed ``Josephine the
Short-Neck Giraffe'' into a poem for children in 1975.
   For years, Rogers tried to have the musical produced on stage or
as an animated film.
   ``I still think it would be great for animation and a stage
production,'' he said. ``But I thought unless we get it out on the
air, I don't think anybody's going to know about it.''
   The story Rogers wrote 39 years ago is vastly different from the
musical airing next week. It is the Neighborhood's 13th musical.
   ``At the end of the (original) story, when people are telling
Josephine that they like her just the way she is, she raises her
head to look at them because she hasn't really heard this message
before and her neck starts to grow. And it grows and grows and
grows until her neck is as tall as everybody else's,'' Rogers said.
   In the musical, Josephine's neck remains short.
   ``I think it shows how much we've grown,'' Rogers said. ``You
know, you don't have to look like everybody else to be acceptable
and to feel acceptable. And wishes don't always come true.
   ``Because for a year and a day I've been wishing, she sang. That
was one of her first songs. Her wish was for a longer neck, she
thought. But really her wish was to have people like her exactly as
she is. So often what we say we're wishing for isn't necessarily
what is behind the wish. This is very philosophical.''
   Will pre-schoolers be able to grasp such a serious message, even
in such a light-hearted setting?
   ``Maybe not in words, but let their hearts speak to them the way
Hazel said to J.R., `Just let your heart speak,''' Rogers said. ``I
think that that's the way an awful lot of communication takes
place.''

<HEAD>Churches' Shareholder Clout Seen Having Impact</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corporate America rarely admits that its
business decisions are swayed by demands of religious idealists.
But the churches keep trying and see evidence of results.
   The effects often aren't immediate, and defeats are numerous,
but ministers, priests and nuns stick to prodding the stockholder
meetings, and eventually, company changes come, by degrees.
   ``It's a cumulative impact,'' said Timothy Smith, executive
director of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibillity.
``The churches also have become more sophisticated about it and are
working with a broader network. They're having a more powerful
influence on companies.''
   The religious persistence has loosed a stream of 166
church-sponsored shareholder resolutions into scheduled meetings
this year of 124 corporations, pressing for various actions. Some
of the requests are expected to be settled in advance through
negotiation without coming up for a vote, indicating the
consideration given church proposals.
   ``From a fourth to a third of the resolutions are withdrawn in
negotiations through a meeting of minds,'' Smith said. ``It has
become standard wisdom for companies to be open to these talks.''
   Altogether, the 22 Protestant denominations and agencies and 220
Roman Catholic orders and dioceses working to influence corporate
polices hold stock worth a total of $25 billion.
   ``The religious community is challenging corporations to raise
their standards and make accountability to society and community a
part of their success formula,'' Smith said.
   When the movement first began 18 years ago, churches could
seldom garner the 3 percent of the votes needed to keep an issue on
the ballot for the next meeting, but now they regularly win 10
percent to 25 percent.
   ``That's of pretty strong significance, and can't just be
ignored,'' Smith said.
   The church clout has been strengthened by combining on many
issues with various other institutional shareholders, public and
private, bringing the total shareholder leverage to more than $260
billion.
   Reflecting results of the efforts, a total of 117 U.S. companies
in the last five years have sold their holdings in South Africa,
repeatedly targeted by church resolutions because of its system of
racial separation.
   That still was a prime concern this year, with 100 companies
asked to end business ties with that country, such as extended bank
loans and trade or franchise arrangements, even though many of the
companies have quit direct operations there.
   ``The business climate is changing in regard to South Africa,
and companies are seeing its best to disengage,'' said Diane
Bratcher, communications director of the interfaith coalition.
   ``We're no longer just little shareholder resolutions, but
selective buying and other profit forces are at work.''
   The center, a unit of the National Council of Churches, is
coordinating resolutions on numerous other matters, including
asking 17 companies to halt nuclear weapons production and begin
converting to peaceful alternatives.
   ``U.S. security is served more effectively through jobs and
trade competitiveness and that is where expertise should be
applied,'' said Sister Valerie Heinonen, the center's program
director on arms issues.
   Protestant and Roman Catholic shareholders also are asking 11
companies for affirmative action on behalf of women and racial
minority employes.
   Dara Demmings, director of the center's equality program, said
companies have become ``more open to suggestions from religious
affiliated investors'' about their affirmative-action programs.
   Religious investors also are questioning 21 U.S. companies about
equal employment practices in plants in Northern Ireland, asking
for stepped up efforts against religious discrimination, blamed in
the strife there.
   Smith, a United Methodist, said that while many companies are
reluctant to admit it, ``they're paying a great deal more attention
to resolutions coming from the churches than before.''
   He said one corporate official described the churches concerns
as an ``early social warning system'' pointing to problematical
situations needing to be treated before they become severe.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle Rate Their 100 Days</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In back-to-back appraisals, Vice President Dan
Quayle and President Bush issued their own report cards on their
first 100 days. Not surprisingly, the marks were excellent.
   Bush said his administration is off to a good start in
confronting problems that demand ``urgent attention and decisive
action,'' and in setting a steady course for long-term progress.
   Quayle said the United States is disproving ``the so-called
declininsts,'' who see signs of national retreat. The vice
president said his message on a 12-day mission to the Pacific is
one of optimism, with alliances flourishing, trade booming, U.S.
political and economic principles ascendant.
   There are other grading systems, of course.
   Not all of them are quite so enthusiastic about the first
semester of the new administration.
   For example, while Bush boasted of a bipartisan budget agreement
that kept ``my no new taxes pledge intact,'' the deal does not
deliver the decisive deficit curbs he also promised during the 1988
campaign. Indeed, some critics have called the deal a sham that
simply puts off the day of budget reckoning until next year. Bush
said it was ``a strong first step.''
   Quayle, then Bush addressed members of The Associated Press in
Chicago on Monday, two hours apart. The vice president's speech
was, in his phrase, a ``pre-trip briefing'' on his trip to
Australia, Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. That turned out to
fit one of his 100-day observations _ Quayle said his biggest
surprise was how much he enjoys foreign travel. The Bush script was
an assessment of the first 100 days.
   His staff also turned out a 17-page background summary on
accomplishments but skipped setbacks like Senate rejection of John
Tower's nomination to be secretary of defense.
   The vice president answered questions from AP member publishers,
and said he senses a change in the way he is viewed and covered
after a season of constant criticism.
   ``Now in the position of approaching the 100 days, I think the
people of America are going to judge me on my job performance and
that's the way it should be,'' he said. ``And I believe that's the
way the news media is and will continue to cover me as the vice
president of the United States and I believe that's fair.''
   Quayle's account of what he has learned about that job, and
about himself, since the inauguration sounded as though he'd been
taking a refresher course in political science.
   ``... I think what I have learned most about the job is what the
true responsibilities of the office of vice president are and what
the responsibilities of the office of president are,'' he said. ``I
work every day in close contact with President Bush and I see how
he formulates his policies. I'm there to give my opinions. I see
the inner workings of the office of the president. So I have a much
keener appreciation from a practical day-to-day operation how the
two offices work.''
   That plus a keener appreciation of traveling abroad on Air Force
2.
   Quayle said that as a senator, most of his travel was back and
forth to Indiana, except for a couple trips to Europe. He said he's
been surprised at ``how much I am enjoying myself in foreign policy
travel...'' to Latin America and now to Southeast Asia. He said his
foreign missions have had a very positive impact.
   The Bush appraisal was a summary of proposals and plans,
designed to counter complaints that his administration has drifted
without a clear agenda. ``I think the work we've done these past
three months demonstrates the value of tough, principled
negotiations between this administration and Congress,'' the
president said.
   He cited the budget agreement, a deal for non-military aid to
the Contras, the savings and loan reform and bailout bill that has
passed the Senate, his ethics reform bill, the drive against drugs,
his education and child care proposals.
   Bush said thorough reviews of foreign and defense policy issues
will be completed late in May, pointing to strategies for a time of
``remarkable change in international affairs.''
   The president said there's a running debate now on what it takes
to move the nation forward. He said it takes principle,
performance, ideology, action, ``and this administration
understands that the American people expect all of these _ and
something more.
   ``They expect results.''
   Results will be the final exam on each of issue. Those are the
grades that really will count.

   The rules of the border rarely change.
   Despite the ``Not Welcome'' signs, Central American refugees
keep coming. Despite the immigration service's recent crackdown and
new detention camps, they stream by the thousand to the United
States.
   And despite criminal convictions, waning interest around the
country and little money, Southside Presbyterian Church, home and
heart of the sanctuary movement, is still welcoming and
transporting refugees who want to make America home.
   This scraggly, pale blue barrio church spawned an international
underground railroad seven years ago by declaring itself a
sanctuary for illegal aliens. Now Southside is making another
statement.
   The church plans to break ground this summer on an addition that
will double its size and for the first time provide bedrooms for
aliens, who have slept on the chapel's floor over the past seven
years.
   The addition is a sign of the movement's uneasy truce with
federal authorities, its survival despite eight members' felony
convictions and its struggle to cope with the recent wave of new
business.
   ``It's a recognition that we're in it for the long haul, that
we're going through a transition from emergency assistance to
institutionalizing this thing,'' said Southside's lanky,
blue-jeaned minister, John Fife, the sanctuary movement's founder.
   ``We're still doing sanctuary, and we're doing so quite
publicly.''
   Fife, who is currently free on five years' probation, and others
here have continued to sneak refugees across the U.S.-Mexico border
about once a week, sheltering immigrants in Southside every night,
and helping move them along to other U.S. cities or Canada.
   In the last six months, church workers aiding aliens say they
have seen a new wave of Central Americans heading north to escape
war and economic troubles.
   The new flood of aliens and a resulting border crackdown in
south Texas by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service may
well mean revival of the sanctuary movement, which federal
authorities have declared dead, Fife and others said.
   ``In the last six months, we've sent more individuals into
sanctuary congregations than the previous two years combined,''
Fife said.
   ``It's really picked up since the first of the year,'' agreed
the Rev. Gustau Shultz, head of the National Sanctuary Defense Fund.
   In Tucson, the sanctuary movement has chosen to ward off the INS
by staying out in the open. Federal officials are notified of all
actions _ even plans to construct a new building. When there are
mailings or notices, the INS is sent a copy.
   ``What we do on the border has become routine, almost
bureaucratic,'' said Jim Corbett, a Quaker who helped found the
movement with Fife and who was one of three acquitted in the Tucson
trial. Sanctuary workers send letters informing the INS of each
border crossing.
   Volunteers now fear stumbling into drug smugglers on the border
more than Border Patrol agents.
   Indeed, when the local jails or detention centers fill up, even
the authorities deliver aliens to Southside, where they know they
will be housed and fed. One night, three Tucson police squad cars
delivered 16 Guatemalans, Fife said.
   The federal government, which used informants and bugged Bible
study groups to build its case in Tucson, apparently pays the
movement little attention now, as the nationwide network of
sanctuary churches has largely faded away.
   Today, aliens prefer to slip into cities such as Los Angeles and
Miami or go on to Canada. Most volunteers have gone on to other
efforts.
   ``We're seeing a more contemporary manifestation of sanctuary,''
said Shultz. ``It's really turning much more to some direct
services, helping people find housing, assisting with medical care,
education, jobs.''
   Shultz said he recently polled some of the 500 congregations
that had publicly declared themselves part of sanctuary in the
mid-1980s. About 25 percent were still assisting some refugees. The
others were asked if they were still willing.
   ``Some said yes, some no. I'd say more were willing than were
not,'' Shultz said.
   Along the border in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona, only a
handful of sanctuary activists continue moving aliens on their own,
with help from established refugee shelters and a few churches.
Most, intimidated by the government's actions, prefer to remain
anonymous and secret.
   ``What is done here in New Mexico is done very quietly,'' said
Glen Remer-Thamert, an Albuquerque, N.M., Lutheran minister
acquitted of smuggling charges last year on the basis of former
Gov. Toney Anaya's 1986 state sanctuary declaration.
   Albuquerque has only one declared sanctuary church, and it
houses no refugees. A few people still secretly move refugees, but
most of the work focuses on direct social services, said Jane
Bergquist, New Mexico's Sanctuary Defense Fund representative.
   INS officials maintain those in Tucson and Albuquerque who faced
charges were smugglers. Although INS district director Bill
Johnston in Tucson meets with Corbett and others, he warned, ``If
somebody from my office encountered illegal activity, we would
still today arrest them.''
   Fife and Corbett believe that since they have continued their
activities and the INS has not acted, they have established
themselves as part of the quilt of U.S. immigration.
   ``I think what we've established simply by keeping on is de
facto acceptance of the church voluntarily protecting refugees and
functioning as a human rights organization on the border,'' Fife
said.
   As for the movement's relationship with the government, Corbett
doesn't think the INS will plant informants again.
   ``There's no reason for them to infiltrate,'' he said. ``They're
on our mailing list.''

<TEXT>
   After a long spell of rising interest rates,
some financial advisers now contend that the time is at hand for a
change in money-management tactics.
   The economy is slowing, they say, and interest rates are likely
to start falling by midyear, if not sooner.
   If this is actually going to happen, how can savers and
investors make it work to their advantage?
   First of all, never forget that forecasting interest rates is a
guessing game in which no one has all the answers.
   You can consult your banker, broker, accountant or
brother-in-law for an informed opinion. But, experts or not, none
of these people can give you a sure-fire answer.
   Of course, an awareness of this uncertainty doesn't obviate the
need to make decisions based on your best guess about what the
future holds.
   Savers with maturing certificates of deposit must pick a new
place to put the proceeds. Many people buying houses face a choice
between fixed- or adjustable-rate mortgages.
   If you have a strong conviction that rates are headed
substantially lower over an extended period of time, an adjustable
mortgage might look especially appealing.
   No matter how hard it may be to practice it successfully, the
operative rule in managing your savings is simple.
   If you think interest rates are going to decline, you emphasize
investments with longer maturities that enable you to ``lock in''
today's prevailing rates.
   That might mean rolling over a maturing three-month or six-month
certificate of deposit into, say, one that runs for 18 months, two
years or even longer.
   Or it might mean switching some cash now sitting in a money
market mutual fund into a fund that invests in intermediate- or
long-term bonds.
   Should rates decline, yields on money market funds would follow
them down. Longer-term funds, by contrast, would benefit from an
increase in the market value of the bonds they own, and those
funds' net asset values per share should rise.
   Right now extending maturities doesn't bring as much potential
benefit as it traditionally does at this stage of the economic
cycle. It turns out that many bankers also are expecting interest
rates to be lower six months or a year from now.
   So at a typical institution, you may find that the going rate
on, say, a 14-month CD is no higher, or even slightly lower, than
what is offered on a seven-month CD.
   Still, picking a longer maturity assures you of a known return
for a greater period of time.
   Is all the time and trouble involved in this exercise worth it?
How much difference in dollars and cents does it make if you earn
an extra fraction of a percentage point on your money for an
additional year or two?
   For some people who need every dollar of income they can squeeze
out of their savings, the effort may be a necessity. For others, it
is a challenge with psychic as well as financial rewards.
   If you would rather devote your time to other things, however,
there is a strategy to cushion the impact of interest-rate
fluctuations on the return your savings earn.
   You could simply divide your money into equal short,
intermediate and long-term piles. Whenever a CD or other investment
matures, you order it automatically rolled over into a new one of
the same kind and maturity.
   One nice thing about this sort of ``no-brain'' strategy: It
assures that you won't outsmart yourself.

<HEAD>Does Steel Still Need Protection?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resting on a cushion of $2 billion in earnings
from last year, the steel industry hardly appears to be in need of
protection. But some industry leaders say appearances deceive.
   While the domestic steel industry is again profitable, said
David M. Roderick this week, ``it has not fully recovered from the
depressed state of the 1982 to 1986 period.''
   Roderick, chairman of USX, made his comment in announcing
first-quarter earnings of $296 million, an 89 percent increase over
the similar period in 1988, aided partly by strong performances in
areas other than steel.
   At the same time, Bethlehem Steel reported quarterly operating
income of $137 million from basic steel operations, an increase of
40 percent from the $98 million profit earned in the first quarter
of 1988.
   Figures such as these aren't likely to contribute to a
resolution of what has become a perennial debate in the past two
decades: Does the American steel industry, once the world's most
powerful, need protection from imports?
   The issue, always a hot one, could burn political and business
hides this time around. President Bush indicated in his election
campaign that he might consider continuing protection if foreign
governments didn't end subsidies.
   Some of those who have been supporters, however, are among those
who oppose protectionism. They concede that steel jobs are at stake
and that steel is an industry vital to American defense. But they
holler at the cost of protection.
   A report by the Center for the Study of American Business at
Washington University, St. Louis, indicates that current quota
restrictions saved 17,000 U.S. steel industry jobs but destroyed
54,200 jobs in steel-using industries.
   The Heritage Foundation, influential in the Reagan and Bush
administrations, has issued a report exhorting the president to end
quotas, claiming that ``five years of steel quotas have added $18
billion to the cost of U.S. steel.''
   That figure, from a 1985 Office of Management and Budget
estimate of the cost to the nation of four more years of so-called
Voluntary Restraint Agreements, caused Bryan Johnson, Heritage
researcher, to observe trenchantly that ``VRAs have `saved' 17,000
jobs, with salaries averaging $40,000 annually, at a yearly cost of
$200,000 per job.''
   The issue crosses the usual political support lines. It divides
business too. Business people often lend support to each other on
controversial matters. But a spokesman for Caterpillar Inc.
recently denounced steel protectionism, saying ``we and our workers
are paying the price.''
   Looking back, some critics say protection never should have been
granted, and that it enabled a backward industry to loaf instead of
putting its house in order. But supporters say there would be no
industry today without protection.
   The origin of supports goes back to the late 1960s, when more
modern Japanese and European producers increased their shipments to
the United States, allegedly with their governments' help. American
producers yelled ``dumping.''
   In an effort to allow American producers time to modernize and
otherwise become more competitive, Washington arranged Voluntary
Restraint Agreements limiting shipments by foreigners. They were to
be temporary.
   During the 1970s steel production abroad grew while world demand
fell. In 1977, Trigger Price Mechanisms were begun; if steel
shipments into the United States fell below a certain price,
anti-dumping cases were triggered.
   When the TPMs expired in 1982, the U.S. government then put
limits on steel from Europe. Finally, in 1984 the Reagan
administration went back to VRAs, which will expire in September _
unless extended by Bush.
   Years of training have enabled elected officials to juggle hot
potatoes with ease and felicity. But this one's something else,
less of a potato than a white-hot steel ingot, and it's being
passed to George Bush.

<HEAD>Iran Buys New Weapons, Rebuilds Battered Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ED BLANCHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite severe economic problems, Iran is
spending up to $5 billion a year to rebuild its military now that a
cease-fire has been declared in the 8-year-old war with Iraq,
analysts report.
   Iran's relations with Moscow also are warming and the
fundamentalist Moslem regime is turning to the Soviet bloc
increasingly for arms, apparently paying for tanks, artillery and
other weapons with crude oil.
   ``Strengthening the Islamic Republic's defense capabilities is
one of the major tasks we face during the reconstruction period,''
President Ali Khamenei told senior military commanders at a recent
conference.
   Both belligerents have large forces along the cease-fire line
and, with peace talks deadlocked eight months after they began,
Iran's rapid buildup is causing concern among Western officials.
   ``It's very worrisome. They're rebuilding much faster than we
expected,'' a senior official of the U.S. Defense Department told
The Associated Press, on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq also is seeking new weapons to modernize its armed forces,
and both countries have been developing their own arms industries,
including missile production, since the cease-fire Aug. 20.
   Earlier this month, the Tehran daily Payam e-Enqelab said the
missile firepower of the Revolutionary Guards Corps will ``increase
five-fold in the near future'' using domestically produced weapons
with ranges of up to 100 miles.
   The American source said of the Iranian rearmament program: ``It
appears they're talking in the range of $20 billion over the next
4-5 years. They've got serious economic problems and yet they're
spending this kind of money on rebuilding their military. The
question is: to what end?''
   U.S. and other Western officials said Iran's major arms
suppliers in the latter stages of the gulf war, China and North
Korea, still are its main sources.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf region reported recently
that the Chinese are helping Iran build a plant to produce
surface-to-surface missiles.
   Al-Ittihad, a daily in Abu Dhabi, quoted military sources last
month as saying China would provide 40 new Silkworm anti-ship
missiles, a reconnaissance satellite and batteries of HQ-2J
surface-to-air missiles, the Chinese version of the Soviet SAM-2.
   Evidence increases, however, that Iran also is turning to
Eastern Europe for Soviet-designed weapons. U.S. sources said most
of the equipment is tanks, trucks, artillery and small arms rather
than high-technology weapons.
   Gulf newspapers have said Romania would supply nearly 500 tanks,
armored vehicles and tank transporters; help build a naval base on
Qeshm Island in the Strait of Hormuz, and convert a tractor factory
Arak to produce armored vehicles.
   Czechoslovakia will supply Iran with 180 T-54 and T-55 tanks and
help build a plant to make anti-tank weapons, the papers have
reported.
   No independent confirmation of the reports was available, but
Iran has made trade agreements with several Soviet bloc states,
including Romania, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, providing for
payment in crude oil.
   It has a similar pact with Brazil, now the world's sixth largest
arms exporter.
   Iran's official media, monitored in Nicosia, said only that the
deals involve ``products and services,'' but analysts believe arms
are involved.
   ``The East bloc will be swimming with T-54s and T-55s because of
East-West force reductions and it makes a lot of sense that Iran
would be getting a lot of hardware from this quarter,'' said
Hans-Heino Kopietz, a Middle East specialist with the International
Institute for Strategic Studies in London.
   In the U.S. source's view, arms deals with the Soviet bloc
``have obvious advantages, including all-land transportation
through Russia,'' Iran's northern neighbor.
   Tehran also has strengthened military links with its eastern
neighbor Pakistan, a Moslem nation. The Pakistanis are developing
their own arms industry and are advanced in the production of
missiles and some other high-tech weapons.
   Both Brig. Gen. Mansour Sattari, the air force commander, and
Ali Shamkhani, the Revolutionary Guards Corps minister, visited
Islamabad in recent weeks to meet with senior Pakistani military
officials.
   ``We'll soon see the fruits of these talks, which have defense
and other objectives,'' Shamkhani said without elaboration.
   Official Iranian media have reported a defense allocation
equivalent to $5.85 billion in this year's budget, described as
about half last year's total.
   Reselat, a Tehran daily, said Parliament also approved a secret
budget bill in which defense spending was considerably higher.
   Exiled opponents of the regime claimed to have a copy of the
secret budget. They said it included $4.9 billion for the Defense
Ministry and $3.6 billion for Revolutionary Guards.
   The Mujahedeen Khalq, based in Iraq, also told The Associated
Press those figures did not represent Iran's ``entire planned
military spending,''
   Analysts have estimated that, on the basis of such needs as
combat jets, tanks, radars and missiles, Iran would spend about $5
billion a year on new weapons.

   A close aide to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita
committed suicide Wednesday, a day after Takeshita announced he
would resign because of the financial scandal embroiling his
government.
   The aide, Ihei Aoki, was involved in financial dealings that
linked Takeshita personally to the scandal.
   Takeshita, condemned in public opinion polls for the huge stock
and bribery scandal, had announced Tuesday that he was resigning
``to restore the people's trust in government.''
   Japan Broadcasting Corp. said Aoki, who had served as
Takeshita's personal secretary for three decades, took his life by
cutting his wrists with a razor and hanging himself at his home. It
quoted police as saying an ambulance crew, responding to an
emergency call at 10:04 a.m., found Aoki dead.
   Officials at the Tokyo Metropolitan Police headquarters
confirmed the account that Aoki, 58, had slashed his wrists to kill
himself.
   As Takeshita's personal secretary, Aoki handled political
donations, stock transactions and loans, including those from
Recruit Co., the company at the center of the scandal, that linked
the prime minister to some of the deals.
   Last weekend it was disclosed that Aoki had accepted a $384,000
loan from the Recruit conglomerate in 1987 for use in Takeshita's
campaign to succeed Yasuhiro Nakasone as prime minister. The money
was later paid back.
   Recruit is accused of seeking influence and favors by selling
prelisted shares in a subsidiary at bargain prices to politicians,
bureaucrats, business leaders and media executives.
   Takeshita, through Aoki and a relative, was a recipient of such
shares that soared in value after they went on sale to the public
in late 1986. Profits from selling the shares reportedly went into
political funds.
   Aoki received 2,000 of the shares, which yielded a profit of the
equivalent of $30,000.
   Takeshita spend most of Tuesday meeting with other leaders of
the governing Liberal Democratic Party to select a successor but no
clear choice emerged.
   Whoever the party chooses as its new leader is assured of
becoming prime minister because of the party's majority in
Parliament.
   Japanese news reports said former Foreign Minister Masayoshi
Ito, now one of the party's three key leaders, was approached about
acting as an interim prime minister.
   Ito, 75, is chairman of the party's Executive Council and
untainted by money or stock questions. But he is diabetic, and said
Tuesday that a younger leader should take over.
   Japan's news media reported Wednesday that Ito is the probable
successor.
   The Yomiuri Shimbun daily said Takeshita and other party leaders
virtually agreed Tuesday night that Ito should be selected. Another
major newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, said a majority of party
members considered Ito the only appropriate candidate.
   The question of timing also was unclear. Takeshita, 65, said he
would resign after Parliament passes the budget for the 1989 fiscal
year that began April 1. But the budget has been delayed by an
opposition boycott of Parliament over the stock-trading scandal.
   Takeshita said he would go ahead with a planned nine-day trip to
five Southeast Asian nations beginning Saturday, indicating he
hoped Parliament would pass the budget in early May.
   Other potential successors to Takeshita include former Prime
Minister Takeo Fukuda, 84; ex-Deputy Prime Minister Shin Kanemaru,
74; Masaharu Gotoda, 74, who served as a key aide to Nakasone, and
Michita Sakata, 72, speaker of the House of Representatives.
   Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Shintaro Abe and
Kiichi Miyazawa, both leading candidates when Takeshita was chosen
party leader in November 1987, are considered out of the running
now because of their own ties to the scandal.
   Miyazawa was one of three Cabinet ministers who resigned because
of links to the scandal involving Japan's giant Recruit Co., an
information services conglomerate. In addition, prosecutors
arrested 14 people, including two former vice ministers, on bribery
or securities law violation.
   The Recruit scandal broke last summer with revelations the
company had sold cut-price shares in a real estate subsidiary to
more than 150 politicians, bureaucrats, business leaders and media
executives.
   The shares, often bought with money lent by another Recruit
subsidiary, yielded fat profits when sold after the subsidiary went
public in 1986.
   Prosecutors are investigating politicians and aides who bought
such shares from Recruit, which allegedly sought to influence
government policy.
   Takeshita acknowledged this month receiving more than $1 million
in political donations from Recruit, but said they were legal. His
decision to resign came after his further admission during the
weekend that Aoki had borrowed $384,000 from Recruit.
   ``I could feel distrust among my constituents when I visited my
home district,'' said Motoharu Moriyama, a Liberal Democratic Party
lawmaker.
   Adding to Takeshita's unpopularity was a 3 percent consumption
tax. Takeshita had pushed the tax through Parliament as tax reform
package that also included income tax cuts.
   Japan's political opposition said Takeshita's resignation was
not enough.
   ``The only reasonable path is complete political reform,'' said
Takako Doi, chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party. ``The Cabinet
must resign en masse, Nakasone must be brought to testify (about
the Recruit scandal) under oath in Parliament, and new
parliamentary elections must be called.''
   Elections are scheduled this summer for half the seats in
Parliament's upper house, but the government does not need to call
elections for the more powerful lower house until next year.
   The stock market also reacted calmly and positively to the news,
rising 439 points or 1.34 percent, its third-largest gain this
year. Traders said Takeshita's announcement did away with some
political and economic uncertainty.

<HEAD>Group Announces Seal Of Approval For Computer Interconnection</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An influential group of computer makers and
users has announced a seal that will certify computers that
interconnect easily with other makes.
   Big computer buyers led by General Motors Corp. and the federal
government demanded such a program because of dissatisfaction with
the existing cacophony in communications between computers. The
seal is called the COS Mark.
   The seal was unveiled Tuesday by the McLean, Va.-based
Corporation for Open Systems International, or COS. The
organization touted the program as a step toward making computers
``interoperable'' _ that is, as easy to connect as telephones.
   The interoperability of computers, while helpful, does not solve
the problem that programs for one computer still may not run on
another. But it does help with things like sharing electronic mail
and data files.
   While some basic communications standards have been set,
high-level standards that cover things like how information appears
on the screen and plugs into programs are still in flux.
   General Motors, plagued by incompatible computers in its
factories, has demanded that computer makers comply with the
Map-Top interconnection standard. GM developed that standard, which
has since been adopted by other users.
   The world's biggest computer user, the U.S. government, has its
own interconnection standard, which will be imposed on all would-be
suppliers to federal agencies starting Aug. 15, 1990.
   The COS Mark seal of approval complies with both those
standards, the organization said at a Washington news conference.
The organization will have a testing program to decide whether
computers and communication devices deserve its seal of approval,
it said.
   ``There is no doubt that today's unveiling of the COS Mark
program is one of the most important milestones, not only in COS'
history, but in the history of the information services industry as
well,'' Lincoln D. Faurer, the group's president and chief
executive, said in a written statement.
   ``What they're trying to do is very ambitious. It's hard to set
and implement a standard among competitors,'' said Mary Modahl, an
analyst of network strategy at Forrest Research Inc. in Cambridge,
Mass.
   Achieving interoperability is so difficult that engineers from
competing companies may have to sit down together in some cases and
work out problems identified by the COS Mark certifiers, she said.
   Products from three companies _ Hewlett-Packard Co., Motorola
Inc. and Concord Communications Inc. _ were the first to receive
the COS Mark under a trial certification program.
   Statements of support for the COS Mark program were issued by
other companies, including Data General Corp., NCR Corp., Northern
Telecom Inc., Unisys Corp., Xerox Corp. and American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co.
   Also backing the program were such users as GM and the Defense
Communications Agency.
   Easy interoperability is a threat to the world's two biggest
computer makers, International Business Machines Corp. and Digital
Equipment Corp., which traditionally locked customers into their
own software and communication systems. But even those companies
have been forced to adopt industry-wide standards because of their
customers' demands.
   Representatives of IBM and Digital said Tuesday their companies
are active members of the Corporation for Open Systems and support
the COS Mark program.

<HEAD>Florida Sues Touche Ross For More Than $100 Million</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Florida has filed suit against Touche
Ross &amp; Co. for more than $100 million in damages as the
court-appointed receiver for now-insolvent International Medical
Centers Inc.
   The lawsuit seeks to recover damages due to alleged gross
negligence, breach of fiduciary duty and negligent
misrepresentations by the auditor, according to a news release
Tuesday by the Florida Department of Insurance.
   IMC, once Florida's largest health maintenance organization, was
declared insolvent and placed in receivership May 14, 1987.
   ``As a regulator, we rely upon companies to submit audited
financial information that is accurate,'' State Treasurer and
Insurance Commissioner Tom Gallagher said. ``If it is not, we can't
do our job and carry out the law.''
   Robert W. Mannix, associate general counsel for Touche Ross at
the company's headquarters in New York, said the Big Eight
accounting firm had conducted IMC audits thoroughly and
professionally.
   Mannix also said that Florida's insurance department had been
conducting its own examinations and was fully informed of events
and developments at IMC before taking over the HMO.
   ``This phenomenon of regulators suing Big Eight accounting firms
in an effort to blame the accounting profession for the regulators'
own failings has become quite familiar lately,'' Mannix said.
   Miguel Recarey Jr., former president of IMC, fled the country in
1987 in the face of indictments on federal charges including
wire-tapping, bribery and embezzlement in the wake of the collapse
of IMC.
   The insurance department also sued Touche Ross in April 1988,
claiming that the firm should have informed the state that IMC was
due a $2.2 million federal income tax refund. The refund paid to
Recarey Enterprises eventually went to Miguel Recarey just before
he fled.

<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines has been given two weeks to
reach an accord with travel agents on a new policy for
ticketholders seeking refunds due to the 7-week-old strike against
the carrier.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland, who is overseeing
Eastern's Chapter 11 reorganization, held a brief hearing Tuesday
on the matter. He then adjourned the session for two weeks.
   Zack Clement, an attorney representing Miami-based Eastern, said
the airline will try to reach an accord with the American Society
of Travel Agents and plans to propose a new refund plan to the
court in a few weeks.
   ASTA has petitioned the court to require Eastern to pay refunds
on unused tickets to travel agents, who would pass the refunds on
to their customers.
   The airline has said its debts include about $165 million in
unused tickets issued before its March 9 bankruptcy filing in the
New York court. Eastern estimates it sells 75 percent of its
tickets through travel agents.
   Under Eastern's current policy, consumers holding unused tickets
purchased before the Chapter 11 filing have several options but
must apply for any refunds directly from Eastern.
   The customers can use the tickets to fly their original
itineraries on existing Eastern flights where available _ the
carrier has been operating only about 10 percent of its pre-strike
schedule _ or on sister carrier Continental Airlines if seats are
available.
   Alternatively, consumers can apply for refunds from credit card
companies for tickets they charged on the cards or can apply to the
bankruptcy court as unsecured creditors.
   Although airlines generally honor each other's tickets, charging
a fee for the service, competitors stopped honoring Eastern tickets
after it filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors.
   ``There's a lot of hardship'' for Eastern ticketholders, James
Flug, an attorney representing Consumers Union, told Lifland. The
situation breeds ill-will toward the airline, Flug said.
   Consumers Union, the non-profit consumer advocacy group that
publishes Consumer Reports magazine, has joined the travel agents'
petition, seeking to broaden it to include passengers who purchased
tickets individually rather than through agents. The group has
asked the court to require Eastern to reimburse those passengers
before the company pays off other creditors.
   The Consumers Union request ``clearly requires the payment of
more than the company can afford to pay,'' Clement told Lifland.
   At an earlier hearing Tuesday, Brian Bradford, Eastern's
director of cash management and credit, said the airline has about
$183 million in cash on hand. That reserve is expected to drop to
about $107 million by the end of May, excluding proceeds from any
asset sales made before then, he said.
   Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. of Houston, told its major
creditors Monday that it intends to sell its Northeast shuttle
service and its Philadelphia hub as part of a plan to rebuild as a
smaller carrier. Those two sales, which must be approved by
creditors and the bankruptcy court, would give Eastern a cash
balance of just under $500 million, Bradford said.
   Clayton Glasgow, the airline's director of financial performance
analysis, told the hearing that Eastern is losing about $1 million
a day.
   In a statement Tuesday, the Air Line Pilots Association
criticized Eastern's downsizing plan as unrealistic.
   The union, which represents Eastern pilots, most of whom have
walked off the job, said the plan cannot be realized because the
company won't be able to hire and train the 1,700 pilots it says it
needs. The union also questioned the carrier's belief that the plan
would lead to profitability since the airline still would be
saddled with high fixed costs.

<HEAD>Drexel Selling Half Its Retail Brokerage Business To Smith Barney</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Venerable Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. is
buying about half of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s retail brokerage
business in a deal Drexel hopes will help it shed the stigma of the
Wall Street insider trading scandal.
   The sale announced Tuesday came a week after the 157-year-old
firm, a leading purveyor of debt securities called junk bonds,
disclosed restructuring plans that included the sale of the retail
network and a 33 percent cut in staff.
   The restructuring was prompted partly by bad publicity due to an
intensive federal fraud probe of Drexel and the historic settlement
of securities fraud charges stemming from the scandal that surfaced
more than two years ago. The settlement raised the prospect that
Drexel could lose its broker license in some states.
   Smith Barney would get 19 Drexel offices, including some of its
largest retail branches, and about 500 of Drexel's
biggest-producing account executives.
   Neither firm disclosed a sale price, but Wall Street brokerage
experts have said the entire division was worth $50 million to $200
million.
   Drexel said it would sell the remainder of its 43-office
brokerage network piecemeal and ``will be working with our branch
people to assure the orderly transition of those offices.''
   Spokesman Steven Anreder declined to say whether any sales were
under negotiation or to elaborate on the fate of the 600 other
account executives in the unsold offices.
   For Smith Barney, a 115-year-old firm with a stodgy image
symbolized by television ads that its brokers ``make money the old
fashioned way _ they earn it,'' the addition of Drexel offices and
people would mark a major step in its effort to become a more
powerful force in the brokerage business.
   Smith Barney is a unit of Primerica Corp., a diversified
financial services company based in Greenwich, Conn. The brokerage
has said it wants to become bigger, more specialized and more
profitable.
   Primerica stock fell 25 cents Tuesday to close at $20.87{ a
share in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Drexel said the offices to be sold to Smith Barney include
branches in Manhattan; Boca Raton, Miami Beach and Miami, Fla;
Baton Rouge and New Orleans, La; Boston; Denver; Encino and Palo
Alto, Calif; Houston; Paramus, N.J.; Providence, R.I.; Rockville,
Md; St. Louis, Mo.; Scottsdale, Ariz; Washington, D.C.; and White
Plains, N.Y.
   Smith Barney will get the leases, furniture and fixtures in all
branches as part of the deal.
   Drexel was the biggest target of a federal investigation that
grew out of revelations provided by stock speculator Ivan Boesky,
the inside trader serving a three-year prison term.
   As part of an agreement to settle criminal and civil fraud
charges, Drexel agreed to pay $650 million in fines, plead guilty
to six felonies and subject itself to unprecedented federal
scrutiny of the way it does business.
   Drexel is privately owned and does not disclose earnings or
revenue figures, although it is considered one of Wall Street's
biggest and most profitable firms. Drexel has said the brokerage
unit accounts for only about 10 percent of overall business and
that its primary money-maker is the firm's leading role in the $175
billion junk bond market.
   The sale to Smith Barney came a day after three Drexel workers
affected by the restructuring filed a class-action suit accusing
the firm's top managers with breach of contract and violations of
their duties.
   The suit, filed in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan,
contends that the sale of the unit will cost the brokers millions
of dollars because they will be forced to sell their Drexel stock
for far below its true value. Drexel officials have declined to
comment on the suit.

<HEAD>Motorola Introduces Smaller Cellular Phone</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. has introduced a dramatically
smaller cellular telephone that can be carried in a purse or coat
pocket.
   The device, half the size of any other portable cellular model,
is about as wide and long as a checkbook. It is about as thick as a
fat wallet at the earpiece while tapering down to half the
thickness of a deck of cards at the mouthpiece.
   The phone, introduced here Tuesday, has a shorter-than-usual
battery life. The 10.7-ounce model has a 30-minute rechargeable
battery, while the 12.3-ounce one has a 75-minute battery. It needs
no wires or base to operate.
   The device, called the Micro Tac Personal Telephone, is expected
to retail for $2,995 and be available six weeks after being
ordered. Motorola officials said they were taking orders
immediately.
   ``This is a new category of cellular _ the personal cellular,''
said Jim Bernhart, vice president and director of distribution for
Motorola's cellular subscriber group. ``We view it as the wave of
the future.''
   Officials of the Schaumburg, Ill.-based company would not reveal
development costs for the new device, but said the company had
invested about $350 million in development of cellular telephones.
   Bob Weisshappel, Motorola vice president and director of the
North American subscriber division, said the device has the
identical range to the company's larger, Dynatac portable.
   Cellular telephones work as radio transmitters and receivers.
Metropolitan areas offering cellular service are divided up into
sections called cells, with each cell containing a
receiving-transmitting antenna to connect many calls simultaneously
with the local phone system.
   According to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the United States has about 2 million cellular
subscribers. Nearly 839,000 subscribers were added in 1988, the
association said.
   In the last six months of 1988, cellular service revenues were
$1.07 billion, and the average monthly cellular phone bill was
$98.02, the association said.

<HEAD>NCNB Chairman Explains Why Bank Dropped C&amp;S Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. may have lost its bid to take over
Citizens &amp; Southern Corp. of Atlanta, but Chairman Hugh McColl says
the North Carolina-based bank plans to continue its growth ``from
Baltimore to Miami.''
   ``It's a fact we're becoming a national company,'' McColl said
Tuesday. ``It's a fact that we're growing instead of dying.'' He
added that NCNB has no plans to expand outside the Southeast and
Texas.
   McColl predicted that large-scale mergers soon will become a
necessity in the banking industry.
   ``We plan to become a major banking company in the U.S.,''
McColl said. ``There will be far fewer players who are much larger.
We will survive.''
   McColl said NCNB has no intention of resubmitting an offer for
C&amp;S, calling his withdrawal of the $2.4 billion bid Monday ``the
end of the saga.''
   ``We have put this chapter behind us,'' he told reporters at a
news conference at NCNB's Charlotte headquarters.
   The C&amp;S takeover would have been the largest bank merger in U.S.
history, combining the assets of the biggest banks in North
Carolina and Georgia. With $76 billion in assets, the new bank
would have been the nation's sixth-largest. On March 30, NCNB,
which has more than $50 billion in assets, shocked the banking
industry by launching the stock bid for the Atlanta bank. When it
appeared the takeover attempt was about to turn nasty, McColl
dropped a bombshell on Monday by abruptly withdrawing the bid.
   ``We always wanted it to be a friendly deal,'' he said. ``We
never said we'd do a hostile deal. When we couldn't pull it off, we
decided to withdraw.''
   The withdrawal marked the second time that NCNB failed to gain a
foothold in the lucrative Atlanta banking market. The bank lost out
to rival Wachovia Corp. of Winston-Salem for First Atlanta Corp. in
1985.
   Meanwhile, NCNB took out full-page ads Tuesday in newspapers in
Charlotte and Atlanta and several other large North Carolina cities
in an apparent effort to explain its side of the takeover battle.
   ``If all you know about NCNB is what you've been reading in the
business section, you're missing a big, big part of what we're all
about,'' the advertisement said.
   ``For example, we at NCNB see a day when Southerners won't have
to go outside the region to secure the capital they need,'' the ad
said. ``We've already made loans that a few years ago no Southern
bank could make.
   ``The way we look at it, being big isn't a goal,'' it said.
``It's a result of doing the absolute best we can for employees,
customers, communities and shareholders.''
   McColl deferred questions about the purpose of the ads.
   Just four months ago, NCNB effectively doubled its size when it
was selected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire the
largest bank in Texas, First RepublicBank Corp.
   Since 1982, NCNB has expanded aggressively into new markets in
Florida, South Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee. The First
RepublicBank move was the biggest until the C&amp;S offer.

   A former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. bond trader
has pleaded innocent to federal racketeering and fraud charges in
two major Wall Street securities cases.
   Also Tuesday, a federal judge tentatively set the trial of
former Drexel junk bond financier Michael Milken for June 30, but
also scheduled a more likely March 1990 date.
   The former bond trader, Bruce Lee Newberg, 32, denied all
charges made against him in a March 29 indictment that also
targeted Milken and charges in an August 1988 indictment of the
defunct securities firm Princeton-Newport Partners LP.
   The two cases are considered the most prominent pending trials
in the three-year government investigation of stock crimes
developed from information provided by by jailed inside trader Ivan
Boesky.
   Newberg already has agreed to set aside $1.6 million in assets _
equal to his 1987 salary _ to guarantee forfeitures he might have
to make if convicted in the Milken case under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act.
   Last year, Newberg posted $2.5 million with the government in
connection with the RICO forefeiture provisions in the
Princeton-Newport case, which also charged five partners of the New
Jersey securities firm.
   No bail was set in connection with the Milken indictment because
Newberg already remains free on $250,000 bond in the
Princeton-Newport case. His attorneys actually entered an innocent
plea for him in that case in August, but he made a personal plea on
Tuesday.
   Both pleas on Tuesday were entered before U.S. District Judge
Kimba Wood.
   Lawyers have called the dual RICO indictment of Newberg a
rarity. Defense attorneys have indicated they plan to seek
dismissal of all counts against Newberg based on the constitutional
prohibition of double jeopardy, which bars citizens from being
tried twice on the same charges.
   The charges in the 98-count Milken indictment and the 35-count
Princeton-Newport case parallel each other. They focus on a series
of alleged stock manipulations and so-called stock ``parking''
schemes involving Princeton-Newport, Drexel, Milken and Boesky.
   Defense attorneys claim Newberg was charged in both indictments
in an attempt to pressure him into cooperating with prosecutors.
   The Princeton-Newport trial is to begin June 5. At a hearing
Tuesday, Wood set the June 30 trial date for Newberg, Milken and
Milken's brother Lowell because of federal criminal law procedures,
but the additional March 1, 1990, date was considered more
realistic because of the complexity of the case.
   Milken and his brother have pleaded innocent to the charges, as
have the five other Princeton-Newport defendants.
   Newberg did not attend the original April 7 arraignment in the
Milken case because he was injured in a skiing accident.
   Newberg, who reported directly to Milken at Drexel's high-yield
bond division in Beverly Hills, Calif., was present for the
arraignment at Manhattan federal court. He made no remarks other
than to plead not guilty to the judge.

<TEXT>
   Westinghouse Electric Corp. says it will pay
to clean up polluted drinking water for 9,000 suburban Pittsburgh
residents whose supplies have been tainted for the past year.
   State officials found Westinghouse's Vanport factory to be the
source of the chemical pollution, although the company has not
admitted specifically that it is to blame for the spread of
trichloroethylene in the water table.
   The chemical, known as TCE, is a degreasing compound believed to
cause cancer if ingested in large amounts over a long period of
time.
   The chemical was discovered a year ago in wells near the Ohio
River operated by the Vanport Municipal Authority in Beaver County.
The concentration in the water has since soared.
   Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse agreed Tuesday to supply water to
authority customers while purifying facilities are built.
   The cleanup could cost Westinghouse as much as $2 million at the
outset. But the company has not yet set a figure since it has
agreed to pay for permanent operation of facilities to remove the
chemical as long as it continues to seep into the deep wells from
which the water is drawn.
   Westinghouse's Vanport plant makes circuit breakers used in
commercial and industrial applications.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has picked Nov. 6 for the start
of the third GAF Corp. stock manipulation trial.
   U.S. District Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, who twice declared
mistrials in the Wall Street corruption case, scheduled the
November date Tuesday after meeting with lawyers for both sides.
   Prosecutors and defense attorneys had agreed on a September
trial date but Lowe had to push the GAF trial back two months
because she is already scheduled to preside over the stock
manipulation trial of independent financial adviser Salim B. Lewis
in September.
   GAF Corp., a Wayne, N.J.-based chemicials and building materials
manufacturer, and its vice chairman, James T. Sherwin, are accused
of securities fraud and other criminal charges for an alleged
scheme to manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp. stock in
October 1986.
   GAF, two subsidiaries and Sherwin, 55, of Princeton, N.J., were
indicted last July for allegedly trying to boost Carbide's stock
shortly before unloading millions of Carbide shares acquired in an
unsuccessful takeover attempt.
   They also were charged with securities fraud, wire fraud and
conspiracy.
   If convicted of all charges, GAF and the subsidiaries face
maximum fines totaling $12 million, or $500,000 on each of eight
counts. Sherwin faces up to 40 years in prison and fines totaling
$2 million, if convicted on all counts.
   Lowe declared a mistrial Jan. 10 _ four weeks into the first
trial _ because a prosecutor failed to disclose a report that
concluded a major piece of evidence had been altered.
   A second trial with a new jury began Feb. 1. But on March 23,
the second jury said it was deadlocked after 12 days of
deliberations, prompting Lowe to declare a second mistrial.
   The GAF trial is the first courtroom test of information
stemming from the insider trading scandals that rocked Wall Street
in 1986-87.
   The main prosecution witnesss was Boyd L. Jefferies, former head
of a Los Angeles-based brokerage who struck a plea bargain with
prosecutors after being implicated by master insider trader Ivan F.
Boesky.

<HEAD>Johnson Wax Launches New Insecticide Line</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RACINE, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   S.C. Johnson &amp; Co. Inc. plans to spend $100
million advertising its new major weapon in the battle for
dominance in the bug-killing market.
   The Racine-based company, popularly known as Johnson Wax,
unveiled Raid Max, its first major new line of insecticides since
it introduced Raid in 1956.
   The company promised the new product would zap cockroaches not
only on the prowl but in their nests and do the same to ants, fleas
and other pests.
   Johnson is No. 1 in the $500 million U.S. household-insecticide
business, with a roughly 47 percent share of the market. But in
recent years, it has seen its share threatened by competitors,
among them American Cyanamid Co.'s Shulton subsidiary.
   Shulton hopped into the roach market with Combat, a poison
contained in small adhesive-backed containers that prevents roaches
from digesting food. Since 1985, Combat has taken 12 percent of the
market, according to trade publications.
   Johnson Wax, however, thinks it has an answer.
   ``We've gone to the top chemical companies in the world and got
state-of-the-art technology. That's the reason were saying that
these are superior,'' Beth Pritchard, vice president of the
insect-control division of Johnson Wax, said Tuesday.
   ``This is a new generation of insecticides. The formulations are
unique. These formulas have been specifically put together for
heavy infestations.''
   The Raid Max line is positioned as a premium product, with
prices from $2.99 to $4.99 _ about $1 to $1.50 more than Raid
products. The new line has four products: a roach-and-ant spray
killer, a fogger, a roach bait and an ant bait.
   Pritchard said consumer tests in three southern states showed
that the products worked better than anything else available.
   Some analysts, however, were skeptical.
   ``They haven't brought out anything to date as good as Combat,''
said Harvey Sober, a Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. anaylst. He noted
Combat had $20 million in sales the first year on the market.
   It took Johnson Wax six years to develop Raid Max, and the
company is banking on it to stabilize its insecticide sales.
Raymond Farley, president and chief executive officer, acknowledged
earlier this year that sales were off about 8 percent in 1988
because of drought in several parts of the country.
   Johnson Wax, with annual sales of about $2 billion, is a
worldwide manufacturer of personal and homecare products.

   United Press International says it has formed
a wholly owned subsidiary, UPI Broadcasting Inc., to operate its
English and Spanish-language broadcast services.
   UPI President Paul Steinle said Tuesday the new organization
``will allow our broadcast operations to run as a
bottom-line-oriented business, managed by someone responsible not
only for quality but also for its business success.''
   A search was under way for a president to head the subsidiary,
UPI said.
   UPI Broadcasting will develop and expand the UPI Radio Network

broadcast enterprises.
   ``This new organizational arrangement, which reaffirms our
commitment to the broadcasting industry, gives our radio operation
the prominence it deserves _ both in terms of long-term strategy
and of daily operational needs,'' Steinle said.
   Earlier this year UPI implemented a new sales strategy for
radio, with special UPI component news products being offered to
broadcasters.
   As part of the establishment of UPI Broadcasting, UPI also is
launching a syndicated Spanish-language radio service effective
June 1 to replace its barter Spanish-language network.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar held firm in subdued European
trading this morning as the market remained bullish on the U.S.
unit despite potentially bearish factors.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said they were surprised by the
dollar's strength despite bearish factors including last week's
hike in the West German Bundesbank's discount rate and Tuesday's
news that the West German government plans to repeal a 10 percent
witholding tax on interest income.
   Dealers added that the market was quiet ahead of today's
announcement of first-quarter U.S. gross national product figures.
If the figures indicate a slowing of the American economy, as
expected, the dollar will probably fall, they said.
   ``The dollar is still well-bid, although I don't really see
why,'' said a dealer at a European bank in Frankfurt. ``Based on
the fundamentals, the dollar should go weaker.''
   In London one British pound cost $1.6965 today, cheaper for
buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7030.
   Other mid-morning rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with
Tuesday's late rates, included: 1.8702 West German marks, up from
1.8625; 1.6518 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3303 French francs,
up from 6.3065; 2.1085 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1.1885
Canadian dollars, down 1.1910.
   The U.S. unit also stood at 1,370.50 lire, up from its late rate
of 1,366.00 Italian lire Tuesday in London. Italian markets were
closed for a holiday Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, where the business day ends before Europe's begins,
the dollar closed at 131.47 yen, up from Tuesday's late 131.17.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $383.75 a troy ounce,
down from $385.75 late Tuesday. At mid-morning, the city's main
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $384.40.
   Zurich gold was trading at a bid price of $384.30, down from
$385.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold dropped the equivalent of 98 cents to
close at $385.59.
   Silver bullion traded in London at $5.785 bid a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.81.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index, overcoming a
setback in early trading, shot up to a record high today, while the
dollar edged up against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended at 131.47 yen, up 0.30 yen from Tuesday's
131.17-yen close. It opened at 131.38 yen and fluctuated between
131.30 yen and 131.53 yen. The dollar had slipped 1.11 yen over the
three previous trading days.
   The dollar gradually rose against the yen in connection with
dollar-buying against the West German mark, said a trader with the
Bank of Tokyo. Many market participants remained on the sidelines
to await the release later today of the U.S. gross national product
figure for 1989's first three months, he added.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 438.86 points Tuesday, added another 190.15
points, or 0.57 percent, closing today at 33,434.93, a new high.
   Profit-taking following Tuesday's gain sent the index down 51.39
points in morning trading but it rebounded as institutional
investors began buying up shares that had declined in the morning,
analysts said.
   ``Of course (Prime Minister Norobu) Takeshita's remarks (on his
resignation) yesterday wouldn't remedy the whole thing, but
investors expect that it at least will clear up some of the
uncertainties,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama with Nikko Securities in
Tokyo.
   Amid growing public distrust in his government, tainted by a
stock-profiteering and bribery scandal that surfaced last summer,
Takeshita announced Tuesday he would step down as soon as
Parliament passes the fiscal 1989 budget.
   Investors reacted positively to this indication that the budget
would be put through, Shimoyama said.
   ``Some may think it strange that share prices started rising
following the prime minister's announcement he would resign soon,
but it lightened up market psychology,'' he said.

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The big incentive packages introduced recently
helped boost car and light truck sales by 5.4 percent in mid-April,
but one analyst said automakers might have to cut production
further to pare excess inventories.
   The eight companies making cars and light trucks in North
America said Tuesday that they sold vehicles at an average of
41,380 a day during the April 11-20 period this year, compared with
a 39,257 vehicle-a-day rate in mid-April last year.
   Car sales were up 3.7 percent and truck sales rose 8.6 percent.
   ``I'm breathing easier today,'' said analyst Doug Laughlin of
Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. of New York City. ``The selling rate is up and
up against a good number a year ago, and it's part of what we need
to get the inventories back in line.''
   On Tuesday, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. said they
had trimmed their second-quarter and early third-quarter production
schedules.
   The strategy is to combine sales inflated by incentives and
production cuts to reduce inventories before the companies change
manufacturing to the 1990 models later this year.
   ``It looks like they've made both of the necessary
adjustments,'' Laughlin said. ``It should put them in better
inventory shape when the model year rolls around.''
   But analyst David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. in New
York wasn't so sure.
   ``I don't think the (production) cuts that have been made or 20
days of improved sales are going to be enough to solve the
inventory problem,'' he said, adding that the cuts may have to go
deeper and the incentives may have to be sweetened.
   ``I think the incentives are working,'' said analyst Charles
Brady of Oppenheimer &amp; Co. of New York. ``I would have been
surprised if it would have been anything else.''
   The mid-April sales increase wasn't evenly spread across the
major makers. Ford's car sales soared 14.5 percent, compared with a
1.5 percent decline for GM and a 10.3 percent drop for Chrysler
Corp.
   ``What you have here is the strength of Ford's product
momentum,'' Laughlin said. ``When you've got roughly comparable
incentives, this is what happens.
   ``Chrysler, that's a lot tougher one to look at. You've got a
lot of models which aren't in production right now'' and are
sitting on dealer lots, he added.
   Automakers were looking for rising sales rates this month when
they put on the newest incentive packages in late March and early
April. March and April traditionally are strong vehicle buying
periods, but last month proved to be weaker than expected.
   That prompted the Big Three to put on the new incentive
packages, a bit of a gamble since the costs of low-interest
financing and cash rebates come out of manufacturers' profits.
   For 1989, car and truck sales by the eight makers are running
3.9 percent behind the pace of last year, the second-best in
industry history. Car sales are off 6 percent. Light truck sales
are nearly even.

<HEAD>Northwest Gains Ground On Two Fronts To Ward Off Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA WILKINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines gained some ground on
two fronts in its battle with hostile suitor Marvin Davis as a
Delaware judge turned down Davis' effort to void some of
Northwest's defenses and the Minnesota commerce commissioner
ordered the oilman to provide more information on his plans.
   Chancellor William P. Allen of Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington rejected Tuesday Davis' request for an injunction that
would have barred NWA Inc., Northwest's parent, from issuing
``poison pill'' stock rights to shareholders before NWA's annual
meeting May 15.
   But the judge left the door open to another legal challenge of
the poison pill, which makes it more difficult and costly for a
group to take over a company. Allen indicated he would make a final
determination on the legality of the pill within 45 days of the
company's annual meeting.
   Allen ordered NWA to inform its shareholders that the pill might
be invalidated later.
   Davis is offering to buy Northwest for $2.7 billion, or $90 a
share. The NWA board has rejected the offer as inadequate.
   A spokeman for Davis said the oilman's investor group would have
preferred an injunction, but nonetheless was pleased by the judge's
order that shareholders be notified that the pill could be ruled
illegal.
   The decision means Davis could still succeed in acquiring the
nation's fourth-largest airline if he can win control of NWA's
board of directors.
   Tom Ryan, a Northwest spokesman, said he had not fully reviewed
the ruling and could not comment on it in detail, but ``It's fair
to say we're pleased with it.''
   Davis got another blow Tuesday night from Commerce Commissioner
Michael Hatch, who gave Davis' lawyers a Wednesday noon CDT
deadline to give further details on the takeover bid.
   ``The financial statements given to the bank, the lenders, I
think ought to be made available to the shareholders so at least
the offering becomes believable in terms of the ability of the
acquirer to operate an ongoing airline,'' Hatch said.
   Under a 1984 state law, the registration of the Davis offer must
be reviewed by the commerce commissioner. If Hatch decides that
Davis has not made a sufficient explanation of his plans, the
commissioner can order the offer be suspended.
   Davis attorney George A. Vandeman said after the hearing he
would try to convince Hatch that the disclosures of Davis'
financial plan for the Eagan-based airline are adequate and
accurate.
   Hatch said he would issue a ruling by 6 p.m. Wednesday if one is
needed. If he issues a suspension order, Davis would have a chance
to appeal it at a Thursday night hearing at the state Department of
Commerce, Hatch said.
   Vandeman said a suspension would not delay Davis' effort to
acquire Northwest.
   The NWA board of directors on Monday unanimously rejected Davis'
bid, charging that the offer is unfinanced and in part illegal
under securities laws. But the board said it is willing to
negotiate with Davis and other qualified bidders.
   In other developments, the NWA board decided, at least
temporarily, against a planned $1.6 billion order for new planes.
Instead, it authorized its plane-leasing subsidiary to buy 10 used
DC-10s and 14 used DC-9s to lease to Northwest and other carriers.

   The stock market was mixed today in an
innconclusive response to the latest data on the state of the
economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 5.50 to
2,3881.41 in the first half hour of trading.
   But gainers outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 454 up, 309
down and 529 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22.39 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
gross national product rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   Without the effects of last year's drought, however, the agency
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent.
   So analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the
Federal Reserve has sought to restrain inflation.
   But the inflation figures that accompanied the GNP report were
not so encouraging, brokers said, indicating that prices were still
rising at a 5 percent to 5.5 percent annual rate.
   USX rose [ to 33~. On Tuesday the company reported sharply
higher earnings for the first quarter.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .30 to 171.30. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .05 at 343.02.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.77 points to
2,386.91.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 820 down, 681 up and 461 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 165.43 million shares, against 142.10
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy, surpassing the $5 trillion
mark for the first time, expanded at a robust annual rate of 5.5
percent in the first three months of 1989, the fastest pace in more
than a year, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said that almost half of the increase in
the gross national product came from a statistical catch-up from
last year's drought.
   But even discounting this bookkeeping factor, the GNP,
representing the country's total output of goods and services,
advanced at a 3 percent annual rate, down only slightly from a 3.5
percent non-farm growth rate in the final three months of 1988.
   The dollar fell against most major currencies in domestic
trading after the release of today's report, while bond prices were
mostly lower.
   The Bush administration hailed the GNP report as good news that
the economy is continuing to expand at a healthy rate.
   Officials noted in particular the fact that the trade deficit,
which had been widening for two consecutive quarters, showed
improvement again in the first three months of the year while
business investments rose at the fastest pace since last spring.
   ``There is nothing to indicate a recession in 1989 from these
numbers,'' J. Antonio Villamil, the Commerce Department's chief
economist, said at a news briefing. ``We are getting solid,
moderate growth with the kind of mix we need at this stage of the
expansion.''
   The non-farm growth was slightly better than economists had been
expecting. Most analysts believe the U.S. economy will slow
substantially this year under the weight of higher interest rates.
   For the past year, the Federal Reserve has been pushing rates
higher in an effort to fight rising inflationary pressures.
   However, the report contained information that inflation is
rising. A GNP price index which measures a fixed marketbasket of
goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first
quarter, up from a fourth-quarter rate of 4.2 percent.
   Half of the increase came from a pay raise for federal
employees, with rising food and home costs accounting for much of
the rest of the increase.
   The 5.5 percent overall increase in the GNP was more than double
the 2.4 percent advance in the October-December quarter, the last
period in which output was held back because of the lingering
effects of last summer's drought.
   With the start of the new year, the government returned its
estimate of farm output to normal levels, thus accounting for 2.5
percentage points of the 5.5 percent increase in the first quarter.
   Economists expect growth for the remainder of the year to slow
dramatically as the economy adjusts to the year-long credit
tightening done by the Fed.
   The Bush administration and some private economists have begun
to express fears that the central bank could overdo its
anti-inflation battle and risk pushing the country into another
recession.
   However, other analysts believe the Fed will be able to engineer
the tricky ``soft landing'' in which interest rates rise enough to
dampen inflaionary pressures but not enough to choke off the
six-year-old recovery, the longest in peacetime history.
   Today's GNP report showed that the country's total output
climbed to $5.117 trillion, the first time in history it topped the
$5 trillion mark.
   This figure is before inflation is taken into account. After
adjusting for inflation, the GNP rose $54.8 billion in the first
quarter to $4.088 trillion. This figure is expressed in 1982
dollars.
   The 5.5 percent GNP increase was the largest advance since a 6.1
percent jump in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   For all of 1988, the GNP rose 3.9 percent, the best performance
in four years. The Bush administration, counting on continued
strong growth to help reduce the federal budget deficit, is
forecasting that growth in 1989 will dip only slightly to 3.2
percent.
   However, many private economists believe that forecast is far
too optimistic and total growth for the year will be 2.7 percent or
less, a sluggish rate which would not be enough to keep
unemployment from rising.
   The first quarter GNP report provided some evidence that the
economy was slowing.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of all economic
activity, rose at a rate of just 1.3 percent, the slowest advance
in more than a year. Purchases of durable goods such as autos
actually fell by 3.2 percent in the first quarter while purchses of
products not expected to last three years edged up 2 percent.
   Housing construction, another key consumer sector, dropped at an
annual rate of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, the first decline
in a year as the housing industry suffered under the impact of
rising mortgage rates.
   While these two key sectors were flashing signals of a slowdown,
other segments of the economy demonstrated strength from January
through March.
   The country's intractable trade deficit, which had actually been
rising for two consecutive quarters, posted a modest improvement in
the first quarter as a 10.6 percent rise in exports was enough to
offset a 2.3 percent increase in imports.
   In a separate report, the government said that corporate
profits, after taxes, increased 3.2 percent in the fourth quarter
of last year, slighlty better than the previous report which had
put the increase at 2.8 percent.
   The latest survey of 50 top economists issued each month by Blue
Chip Economic Indicators, an investment newsletter, showed that
more than half of the panel now expect a recession to begin by late
this year or early next year. The Blue Chip consensus forecast
calls for GNP growth this year at a lackluster rate of 2.7 percent.

   DuPont Co. said Wednesday its
first-quarter earnings rose 25 percent over last year with strong
performances in the company's petroleum and industrial products
subsidiaries.
   DuPont reported net income of $736 million, or $3.08 a share,
compared with $590 million, or $2.45 a share, in the same 1988
period.
   Sales increased 10 percent to $8.7 billion from $7.9 billion in
last year's first quarter.
   ``The results reflect very good performance across most of the
company's businesses, with a particularly large gain in the
petroleum segment,'' outgoing company chairman Richard E. Heckert
said at the company's annual meeting.
   Edgar S. Willard took over today as chairman and chief executive
officer of the chemical giant.
   Earnings in DuPont's petroleum subsidiary nearly doubled to $217
million from $112 million a year ago. The company's industrial
products division reported a 51.5 percent earnings gain, to $147
million from $97 million. Fibers, polymers and coal also showed
increases.

   Grain and soybean futures opened mixed today on
the Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for more rain forced down
wheat prices and increased demand for soybean meal in Europe pushed
up soybean prices.
   The higher soybean prices reversed a downward trend of the past
two days. The early rally was given a push by the resumption of a
strike by Brazilian dock workers.
   The Kansas wheat crop, damaged by drought, is expected to be
helped by forecasts for rain.
   Corn prices were firm, rising a half cent to a penny in early
trading, as farmers reduced their sales of corn stocks.
   In early trading, wheat was 1} cents to 3{ cents lower with the

   Researchers told Congress today that they are
taking measures to resolve the controversy and skepticism
surrounding their cold-fusion experiment by having government
investigators observe in their laboratory.
   Stanley Pons, a University of Utah chemist who announced the
cold-fusion process to produce energy last month, said his
laboratory has arranged experiments duplicating the process and
have invited scientists from the Los Alamos National Laboratories
to observe.
   ``We have 19 experiments being set up now, including a
demonstratiion for Los Alamos,'' Pons told the House Committee on
Science, Space and Technology.
   Pons said that once the experiment is operating satisfactorily,
the Los Alamos scientists will take it back with them to the
federal laboratory for a detailed analysis.
   Pons and his collaborator, Martin Fleischmann of the University
of Southampton in England, announced at a news conference March 23
that they had achieved fusion at room temperature by using simple
laboratory equipment.
   The Utah researchers said they placed electrodes of platinum and
palladium in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy water, and then
applied an electrical current to the electrodes. They said the
setup split the heavy water into atoms of deuterium and oxygen and
forced deuterium nuclei into the crystal lattice structure of the
palladium metal.
   After operating for a number of hours, the researchers said, the
experiment caused deuterium to become so compressed within the
metal that the nuclei fused. This reaction, they said, produced
heat energy equal to about four times the amount of energy used to
cause the fusion.
   The announcement stunned the international physics community,
which has spent millions of dollars over the last 25 years
attempting to achieve fusion using massive, multimillion-dollar
machines filled with plasmas heated to temperatures of up to 100
million degrees.
   Pons and Fleischman appeared before the House committee today in
a room packed with spectators, journalists and representatives of
other laboratories.
   The two defended their work before sharp questioning by
committee members who probed not only the findings of the
experiment but the manner in which the researchers announced their
work.
   Fleischmann said follow-up articles detailing how the experiment
is being conducted will be published in scientific journals.
   Pons said part of the controversy revolves around the different
way in which chemists and physicists announce the results of their
work. The Utah experiments have come under heavy criticism from
fusion experts because the precise details needed for duplication
of the work have not been released.
   Pons said that typically physicists will circulate a
pre-publication copy of their research to colleagues, who will
informally review it.
   ``For chemists, it is done in a different way,'' he said. ``The
review is left up to the journal.''
   Fleischmann said that in one experiment researchers have been
able to cause water to reach the boiling point. He added, however,
there was still much work yet to be done to develop a way of
harvesting useful energy from this process.
   The Utah researchers said they built their initial experiment
for about $100,000, but Fleischmann said ``production of a scale-up
device will cost about 10 times that'' and that the next phase,
where useful energy was actually developed, ``would cost millions.''
   The researchers also said it could take years to turn the
cold-fusion process into a useful energy source. ``We think it is
feasible but it will require a very high effort,'' Fleischmann said.
   One of the elements to be investigated, said Fleischmann, is the
metal that can be used in cold fusion. The palladium used by the
Utak researchers is an expensive metal that is available in only a
few places on Earth.
   Fleischmann said other experiments are under way to find if
other metals can be used. ``Palladium may be the best choice but
there may be also other possible choices,'' he said.
   The University of Utah was planning to use today's hearing to
request $25 million from the federal government toward a $100
million institute devoted to commercializing the process, The New
York Times reported today.
   While such lobbying for funds is not new, it is highly unusual
for researchers to seek congressional support before their findings
have been confirmed, the newspaper said.
   The day-long hearing was to include at least three nuclear
physicists who have reported that they have been unable to
duplicate the Utah experiments.
   In testimony released to the committee, scientists from the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, Princeton University and Massachusetts
Institute of Technology all expressed strong and sharp skepticism
and doubt about the Utah experiments actually achieving nuclear
fusion.
   Researchers in Texas, California and Washington have reported
what may be fusion reactions, but many other laboratories have
reported failed efforts. Scientists in the Soviet Union and Hungary
reported experiments with reactions that may be fusion.
   Many experts believe fusion to be the ultimate energy source.
The nuclear process is the opposite of the fission reaction that
now powers atomic generating plants. Fission occurs by splitting
atoms and the process leaves behind highly radioactive spent fuel.
   Fusion derives its energy by forcing atoms of deuterium or
hydrogen together. The reaction produces an atom of helium, a burst
of energy and a neutron. Experts believe fusion energy would
produce a much smaller amount of radioactive waste, and that fusion
power plants could be operated with deuterium oxide, or heavy
water, a chemical that can easily be extracted from seawater.
   Natural fusion energy is the power that causes the sun and the
stars to shine. Stellar fusion is created when the massive force of
gravity in stars forces hydrogen atoms to fuse, giving off heat,
light and helium. Most ``hot'' fusion research is an attempt to
duplicate the pressure and heat process seen on the sun.

   The House grappled today with a $4.7 billion
domestic spending bill, and a Democratic plan to pay for it with
savings from defense and other programs drew a veto threat from the
Bush administration.
   The measure would provide money for this year for anti-drug
programs, veterans and college students, and was defended by
Democrats as a way to provide badly needed money for important
priorities.
   Republicans said the bill was loaded down with unnecessary
spending that could wait until next year.
   But it was a plan by the chamber's majority Democrats for saving
money that drew the most fire.
   The Democrats proposed saving $1.4 billion by cutting most
federal programs across-the-board by 0.57 percent. The plan would
pare $1 billion from defense, $353 million from domestic and $43
million from foreign aid this year, according to House
Appropriations Committee estimates.
   Richard Darman, the White House budget director, said he would
urge President Bush to veto the measure if defense spending was cut
and if the ``fiscally irresponsible'' overall bill was not reduced
in size.
   And in a letter to House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said the military cuts would do
``enormous damage'' to the Pentagon's personnel, operations and
maintenance, and research programs.
   Republicans planned to propose a money-saving amendment of their
own, which would reduce portions of the bill and cut many domestic
programs, but would leave defense spending alone.
   With Democrats controlling the House, Speaker Jim Wright,
D-Texas, predicted, ``I anticipate that the leadership amendment
prevails.''
   Critics have complained that without reductions, the spending
bill would push this year's deficit beyond its projected total of
$163 billion. The fiscal year ends Sept. 30.
   Only $1.4 billion of the bill's total spending would occur this
year. The rest would not actually be spent until future years.
   Excluded from cuts under the Democratic plan would be domestic
programs in which spending is required by law, such as benefits
paid to poor people or to the elderly.
   The Senate has yet to consider the spending measure.
   Meanwhile, members of the House Budget Committee held a
closed-door session Tuesday to work on a budget resolution for the
1990 fiscal year.
   The spending plan, which the panel expects to complete Thursday,
is expected to resemble closely the $1.2 trillion document the
Senate Budget Committee adopted last week. It will also reflect the
savings and spending totals set in the budget deal worked out
earlier this month between President Bush and congressional leaders.
   According to documents provided by a participant in Tuesday's
meeting, the House plan is likely to increase Senate spending
levels for education, health and community development programs,
while reducing expenditures for energy, agriculture, and law
enforcement.

   Turner Broadcasting System Inc. said today it
is planning to launch a daily commercial-free news program for
schools in August, challenging one containing advertising that was
recently tested by Whittle Communications LP.
   Turner Chairman Ted Turner told a news conference that his Cable
News Network would begin offering the daily 15-minute program for
schools, CNN Newsroom, starting Aug. 14.
   Whittle is evaluating the results of the test of its news
service, Channel One, in hopes of expanding it nationally in the
fall of 1990.
   Turner said he decided at the last minute against including any
advertising because of some educators' objections.
   He said he had planned to allow corporate sponsors to buy time
to deliver public service messages such as ones encouraging
literacy and discouraging school dropouts and drug abuse, but
changed his mind today after discussions with education officials.
   Turner said the company was profitable and would absorb the
multimillion-dollar expense of the program.
   ``Helping students learn to cope with an increasingly complex
and sometimes threatening world through daily news and information
programming is a natural next step for us,'' he said in a written
statement.
   Representatives of cable operators Tele-Communications Inc.,
Continental Cablevision Inc. and Jones Intercable, which serve 50
million households, said they would provide the Turner service free
of charge to schools in their areas.
   In contrast to the Whittle service, Turner's does not envision
major donations of video equipment and televisions to schools.
   The program will be broadcast by CNN in the early-morning hours,
recorded by the schools and shown to students during the day.
   At the press conference, cable networks Arts &amp; Entertainment,
C-Span and The Discovery Channel said they planned to expand their
own educational programming and see that cable operators provided
it free to schools.
   The Knoxville, Tenn.-based Whittle launched Channel One, a daily
12-minute news show with two minutes of paid advertising, in six
test schools March 6. The schools were each given about $50,000 in
video equipment, TV monitors and satellite dishes in exchange for
agreeing to run the program every school day.
   Some education groups have complained about the advertising on
Channel One, saying students should not be subjected to paid
pitches for candy bars, jeans or anything else while they are in
the classroom.
   But many of the teachers and students involved in the test have
said they considered the advertising a reasonable price to pay for
the equipment and the topical programming.
   Turner has been involved for two years in a venture called
``News Access'' that has made CNN's ``The Week in Review'' program
available to schools along with a detailed classroom guide with
suggestions on how to use portions of the show in class.
   C-Span, the Discovery Channel and Arts &amp; Entertainment each have
previously made separate arrangements for sharing programs with
schools.
   But none of those efforts has drawn the attention that Whittle's
Channel One test did.
   Whittle is reviewing the results of the seven-week test ended
last week and hopes to decide by mid-summer whether to make the
program available nationally in as many as 10,000 schools in the
fall of 1990.

   A federal appeals court today refused to remove
a roadblock to the final settlement of civil securities fraud
charges against Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The settlement Drexel reached with the Securities and Exchange
Commission earlier this month has been blocked from final approval
because of a legal challenge to the district judge presiding over
the case.
   The SEC and Drexel asked the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
to modify its stay of all proceedings before Judge Milton Pollack
in the Drexel civil case to allow another judge to consider and
possibly approve the settlement.
   But the 2nd Circuit said ``that decision does not rest with us''
and refused to intervene.
   The decision means that the landmark settlement of civil
securities fraud charges against the Wall Street investment giant
remains in limbo.
   Resolution of the SEC pact also is needed before Drexel can
formally plead guilty to six felonies and pay $650 million to
settle criminal charges brought by the Manhattan U.S. attorneys
office.
   The appeals court declined to reconsider or clarify its ruling
pending a possible U.S. Supreme Court ruling on whether Pollack
should be removed from the case on grounds that he has a conflict
of interest.
   The 2nd Circuit has issued a stay on all proceeding before
Pollack pending a decision by the Supreme Court, which has not yet
decided whether it will hear the appeal.
   Last week, the SEC and Drexel sought to sidestep the stay by
asking the 2nd Circuit to let another judge handle the settlement.
   But the 2nd Circuit held that ``a decision to assign the case,
or any part of the of it, to another judge rests with Judge Pollack
or with those responsible for the assignment of cases'' at the
district court level in New York.
   Indicted former Drexel bond financier Michael Milken and his
brother Lowell sought to bar Pollack because his wife had an
interest in a company involved in a Drexel transaction.
   ``Judge Pollack is entitled to remain in this case, absent a
Supreme Court ruling to the contrary or new facts which would
warrant his (removal),'' the appeals court said.
   The Milkens, who were not included in the SEC settlement, also
have appealed the criminal settlement alleging it illegally forces
Drexel to withhold their multimillion-dollar 1988 salaries and
dismiss them.
   The two-page appeals court ruling appeared to put new pressure
on Pollack, who refused Drexel's attempts to disqualify him, to
step aside.
   ``So long as Judge Pollack remains assigned to this case, we
must accept his position as part of the status quo,'' said the 2nd
Circuit.
   ``It was in this context that we ruled earlier that the Milken
group has a right to have the Supreme Court determine whether Judge
Pollack should remain in the case before he is allowed to consider
a proposed settlement which may affect the interests of the Milken
group,'' the three-judge panel said.
   As part of its settlements with both the SEC and the U.S.
attorney's office in Manhattan, Drexel is required to fire Michael
Milken and suspend his brother, and not engage in business dealings
with either brother.

   A $400 million blend of big-league
filming and Hollywood stargazing debuts Monday when Florida's top
entertainment resort opens the Disney-MGM Studios theme park, a
135-acre playground with diversions that range from do-it-yourself
music videos to a 1950s sitcom set.
   The complex at Walt Disney World combines working movie-TV sound
studios with backstage tours for the public, a mixed-media
ride-through show and other special effects adventures.
   ``It is a theatrical environment that is very close to the
original conception by Walt Disney,'' Michael Eisner, Walt Disney
Co. chairman, said in an interview. ``It's been on the shelf since
the 1940s and is the culmination of a company dream. This
attraction is unlike anything else we have.''
   It's all themed to the golden age of Hollywood in the 1930s and
1940s, when tyrannical cigar-chomping moguls ran studios and art
deco dominated the building scape.
   Mom, dad and the kids can walk through re-creations of
palm-lined Hollywood Boulevard and Grumman's Chinese Theater, peek
at movies under production, take a role in a television show, make
their own music videos, get a screen test and rub elbows with the
stars at the Brown Derby restaurant.
   Movie and TV production began last summer with the ``Superboy''
syndicated TV series and parts of several large-screen films while
construction continued on the tourist portion.
   The event was preceded by glitzy parties and previews that
included a television special, a parade of famous Hollywood actors
and actresses on the boulevard and live tapings of a mew ``Mickey
Mouse Club'' TV series.
   Dick Nunis, president of Walt Disney Attractions, said he
believes bringing a bit of Hollywood to Florida will reinvigorate
the resort, already visited annually by an estimated 25 million
people that reportedly pump about $2 billion into the area's
economy.
   ``We talked of doing a studio tour when Walt was alive,'' said
Nunis. ``We've wanted to do this for a long, long time. It's a
dream come true.''
   Disney will get a year's jump on some formidable competition in
the high-stakes family entertainment business, in which the company
founded by the late cartoonist has emerged as one of the undisputed
leaders. Universal Studios Florida is building a rival $500 million
complex to be finished next May.
   Just a few miles away, Universal is billed as the nation's
largest working studio outside of Hollywood. Movie and TV
production already is under way at the 440-acre facility owned by
MCA Inc. and Rank Organization PLC of London.
   Universal will feature what it calls a ``total experience'' of
Hollywood-style filmmaking to the public, making the visitor a
participant in the action. It expects to attract up to 6 million
visitors a year.
   Despite their well-publicized rivalry, Disney and MCA officials
insist the competition is good for each other as well as Florida,
where family-oriented entertainment has become one of the dominant
industries.
   ``We've always had competition _ from Sea World, Busch Gardens,
Cape Canaveral, Boardwalk and Baseball and many others,'' Eisner
said. ``We welcome competition. It's good for Central Florida.
Disney does things in its own way, and we feel comfortable that we
will have our niche in the community.''
   The Disney-MGM theme park is the centerpiece of a $1
billion-plus renaissance of the 27,400-acre resort in the pine
woods and citrus groves of central Florida, once populated largely
by alligators and armadillos before it opened 18 years ago.
   Not that a rebirth is needed.
   ``We're having a phenomenal year in both (hotel) occupancy and
(theme park) attendance,'' said Disney World publicist Charlie
Ridgway.
   After achieving a record $3.4 billion in revenues and $522
million in profits in fiscal 1988, Disney has on tap a number of
``openings'' at its Florida resort this year besides the studios.
   On schedule to open this fall is part of what it calls the
largest convention-hotel complex in the Southeast. Making their
debut this summer will be Typhoon Lagoon (``the world's largest
water park'') and the Pleasure Island nighttime entertainment
district.
   Built for the teen-age crowd, Nunis says Typhoon Lagoon will
make all other water attractions as obsolete as Disneyland made
amusement parks in 1955.
   ``We're finally going to be able to make waves,'' says Nunis.
``Surfing, a 100-foot mountain, a saltwater snorkling reef,
including sharks and other live critters (in an enclosed area). I
can hardly wait to put on my bathing suit.''
   Pleasure Island is for those who still have energy left at the
end of an exhausting day at the Disney-MGM Studios park, Epcot
Center or the Magic Kingdom. The complex of restaurants, shops and
nightclubs is built on a six-acre island at the Disney Village.
   Opening this fall is the 770-room Swan Hotel, which along with
the larger Dolphin Hotel will form the lodging side of the
convention-hotel complex near Epcot Center. The 1,500-room Dolphin
is to open in July 1990.
   The more modestly priced Caribbean Beach Resort hotel opens an
additional 800 rooms this summer for a total of 2,112. The 907-room
Grand Floridian Beach Resort, a luxury Victorian-style hotel,
opened last summer.
   Also set for completion this fall will be a new Epcot pavilion,
the Wonders of Life, featuring a simulated ride through the human
bloodstream and a movie that takes a viewer from conception through
birth.
   All Disney's doings are coming together during a busy start for
Florida tourism this year. More than 3.4 million tourists visited
the state in January, an 18.6 percent increase over the first month
of 1988, the Florida Department of Commerce says.
   State tourism officials predict the number of visitors will
increase 6 percent this year. That means the state would host 38.7
million tourists, vs. 36.6 million in 1988.
   Disney's Ridgway attributes the improved season to a generally
strong U.S. economy and a larger number of foreign tourists.
   For local Floridians, Disney World's building spree is one of
the main economic engines providing jobs.
   One of Disney's most-popular spots is the employment office,
currently hiring 2,500 new workers at a minimum pay of $5 an hour
to help staff new attractions that will swell the Disney complex's
workforce to about 28,000, nearly twice the level of eight years
ago.
   The new attractions also have prompted a $1 increase in one-day
admission prices at the Magic Kingdom and Epcot Center and the
introduction of a new four-day passport good at any of the three
theme parks, effective Monday.
   The new ticket will cost $94 for adults and $77 for children 3
to 9 years old. It provides unlimited admission to the three parks
for four days. New single-day admission prices for any one park
will be $29 for adults and $23 for children.

   Police arrested about 100 striking union
members today for trying to block a coal mine, and hundreds of
supporters interfered with buses taking the miners away, officials
said.
   Members of the United Mine Workers were arrested at the entrance
to the Pittston Coal Group's Lambert Fork Mine, said State Police
Lt. J.D. Willis.
   ``We took them away in buses and tried to disembark them for
processing at several places in Dickenson County but were turned
away because of crowd control problems,'' Willis said. He would not
disclose where the bus ended up.
   Strike supporters at a Clintwood elementary school continued a
rally after turning away buses, Willis said.
   ``Everbody's dressed in camouflage, there're hundreds of people
standing there clapping and cheering at the miners in the buses,''
said a woman in the county clerk's office who would not give her
name. ``You'd never know this many people lived in Dickenson
County.''
   The escalation in the union's 3-week-old strike against Pittston
has resulted in hundreds of arrests and a walkout by about 150 high
school students since Monday.
   State Police said at least 200 miners and relatives were
arrested Tuesday for sitting in the entrance and blocking traffic
to and from a coal preparation plant. Union officials estimated the
number at 380.
   State Police made several trips with at least four buses and
several vans before they could remove the protesters and reopen the
truck entrance to the plant. Some pickets were dragged across the
road to the waiting buses.
   About 200 miners were arrested Monday during a sitdown at
Pittston's McClure mine, touching off a daylong rally at the
Dickenson County Courthouse by the miners' friends and relatives
that closed downtown Clintwood.
   On Tuesday, about 150 students walked out of class at high
schools in Dickenson and Wise counties to join the rally. Many of
the youngsters wore camouflage, the strike uniform worn by the
miners, and waved signs at passing cars and trucks.
   Despite the threat of suspension, Kim Childers, a senior at
Clintwood High School, said she expects the protest to continue.
   About 1,700 UMW members have been on strike at Pittston mines in
Virginia and West Virginia since April 5.
   The miners had been working without a contract for 14 months,
and the union accused Pittston of engaging in unfair labor
practices during negotiations, a claim Pittston denies.

   The stock market was little changed today in a

economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.65 to 2,388.56 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 670 up, 668 down and 554
unchanged.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
gross national product rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   Without the effects of last year's drought, however, the agency
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent.
   So analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the
Federal Reserve has sought to restrain inflation.
   But the inflation figures that accompanied the GNP report were
not so encouraging, brokers said, indicating that prices were still
rising at a 5 percent to 5.5 percent annual rate.

<TEXT>
   Prices closed sharply higher on the London Stock
Exchange Wednesday as favorable British trade figures helped to
calm the market's fears of an imminent rise in interest rates.
   The trade report propelled the key Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-stock index briefly above the 2,100-point level, the
top of the recent trading range and an important level both
psychologically and for those charting the market's progress.
   But the index later drifted back as buying interest wasn't
sustained.
   At the close, the index was up 22.2 points, or 1.1 percent, at
2,093.4.
   Volume was relatively high, with 567.7 million shares changing
hands, compared with 577.7 million shares on Tuesday.
   The government reported that Britain had a current account
deficit in March of 1.19 billion pounds, or $2 billion. This was
considerably lower than February's deficit of 1.7 billion pounds,
and well below market expectations of a 1.5 billion-pound gap.
   Analysts cautioned, however, the report might merely have bought
some time, noting that inflationary pressures in the economy could
still force official interest rates higher at a later point.

   The U.S. dollar ended higher against all major
currencies except the Canadian dollar in European trading
Wednesday. Gold prices declined.
   Foreign exchange dealers said sentiment toward the dollar
remains bullish, although trading was not affected by the latest
U.S. economic figures released Wednesday.
   The U.S. government said the gross national product figures
expanding at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.5 percent,
larger than expected.
   ``I have no explanation for the dollar's rise but people want to
buy dollars,'' said Swiss bank dealer Peter Kane at Credit Suisse.
   The British pound rose initially on the narrowing of the trade
deficit in March to $2 billion from $2.8 billion in February, since
a larger deficit had been expected. But the pound eased with the
consequent lessening of pressure for an upward revision of British
interest rates as a counter-inflationary measure.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6932 late Wednesday,
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7030.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Tuesday's late rates: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8625;
1.6555 Swiss francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3395 French francs, up from
6.3065; 2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1,374.00 Italian
lire, up from 1,366.00; and 1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1910.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 131.47 Japanese yen from
131.17 Tuesday. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded higher
at 132.00 yen.
   Gold bullion prices fell. The late gold bid price in London was
$384.25 a troy ounce, down from $385.75 late Tuesday. The Zurich
late bid price was $383.50 an ounce, down from $385.00.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.55 an ounce, down
from $385.65.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.77 a troy
ounce, down from $5.81.

<HEAD>Blimpie Goes After Health-Conscious Consumers With New Low-Cal Menu</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Blimpie is going skimpy on calories.
   The fast-food restaurant known for submarines heaped with meats
and mayo said Wednesday it is expanding the menu to include
low-calorie sandwiches and salads in an attempt to woo
calorie-conscious consumers who might otherwise be avoiding fast
food.
   Industry analysts and nutritionists say the additions _ which
include seafood, turkey, chicken and low-calorie mayonnaise _ is a
response to increased public interest in healthier food, even
though such traditional fast-foods as hamburgers and french fries
remain king.
   But experts also said past attempts at healthier fast food have
produced mixed results, even though most chains now offer salads or
other ``light items.''
   ``We feel there's a mounting hunger for variety among the
public,'' said Tony Conza, chairman of New York-based Astor
Restaurant Group Inc., Blimpie's parent.
   ``The Blimpie Lites appeal to those customers we feel have
abandoned fast food because of the calories,'' Conza said.
   Conza and other Astor executives were in Atlanta to unveil the
new menu to Georgia franchise operators. The Blimpie Lite menu will
be test marketed in Georgia beginning in June and will be
introduced in the chain's 14 other states later in the year.
   Blimpie's regular menu, including 12 sandwiches as well as
salads, will remain in effect at the chain's 350 outlets.
   The new items, developed with the Boston-based Diet Workshop
chain of weight-control facilities, each have less than 300
calories. They include tuna, seafood and crab, chicken, turkey and
tova fish stuffed into whole wheat pita bread or spread on a salad.
The sandwiches will have low-calorie mayonnaise and the salads will
have vinegar dressing.
   ``It fits in with the whole movement in the food industry, not
just fast food, to offer good-tasting, low-calorie, low-fat
items,'' said Jay Freedman, who follows the industry for the
investment firm Kidder Peabody.
   Freedman said introduction of such items in fast food outlets
has produced mixed results, with a major flop being D'Lites, a
Norcross, Ga.-based nutritious fast food chain that filed for
bankruptcy in 1986.
   ``People think about eating healthy, but they do little about
it,'' he said. ``Clearly, there hasn't been an across-the-board
ramp-up of people buying only low-calorie, healthy foods.
   ``My guess is the demographics of the average Blimpie customer
won't fit into someone who is calorie- or fat-conscious.''
   Chris Rosenbloom, associate professor in the Department of
Nutrition and Dietetics at Georgia State University, said consumer
demand has forced the fast food industry to offer alternatives to
its basic menu items.
   Mrs. Rosenbloom also credited consumer groups, such as the
Center for Science in the Public Interest, for alerting people to
the content of fast food and noted many chains such as McDonald's
now have registered dietitians at the corporate level.

   Soybean futures prices recovered modestly from
two days of steep declines on the Chicago Board of Trade on
Wednesday as traders who sold the market earlier in the week bought
in again.
   Corn futures prices increased and wheat futures dropped slightly.
   Soybean prices rose amid talk that a strike by Brazilian dock
workers could go on for some time.
   ``The strike may provide the United States with some export
business, although it hasn't so far,'' said Joel Karlin an analyst
for Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
   ``The market has assimilated most of the bearish news about
weather,'' he said, referring to forecasts for increased rain in
key crop-producing states.
   The Agriculture Department is trying to decide whether to
subsidize additional grain sales to the Soviet Union as talks
continue in Washington with Soviet representatives.
   The department is expected to announce its decision after talks
end Thursday.
   At the close, wheat was 1\ cents to 4 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.10{ per bushel; corn was { cent
to 1} cents higher, with May at $2.65} per bushel; oats were 4\
cents to 5} cents lower with May at $1.83\ per bushel; soybeans
were 2\ cents to 7 cents higher with May at $7.39{ per bushel.

   A travel boom in the Asia-Pacific region has
touched off a scramble among U.S. and Asian airlines for business
in a market growing at twice the pace elsewhere.
   There's a competitive atmosphere in which government policy and
underlying trade friction can have as much to do with an airline's
bottom line as the allure of Singapore Airlines' romantic
advertising or the upgraded, Japanese-speaking service touted by
United Airlines.
   Some Asian airlines complain at what they call unfair advantages
enjoyed by United and Northwest but they want equal privileges in
the U.S. market rather than to retaliate against the far-flung
networks of the big U.S. carriers.
   ``We don't fear the size of these big U.S. carriers but we're
worried about the frequency of their stops in the Southeast Asia
and Pacific region,'' said Nares Hovatanakul of Thai Airways
International in Bangkok. ``We would like to see reciprocity, not
retaliation, because that would not be fair business.''
   The Thai spokesman said U.S. government negotiators refused to
permit more than five weekly flights by the Thai carrier to Seattle
via Tokyo's Narita international airport. ``They won't lift this
restriction and we feel that fair competition is halted,'' he said.
   Everyone wants more landing rights, especially in the United
States and Japan. The Japan-U.S. routes are the most lucrative,
heavily used by business travelers as well as by the fast-growing
number of Japanese tourists.
   U.S. airlines, meanwhile, complain in varying degrees about poor
Japanese facilities and hindrances by the Japanese government.
   ``Narita is the most congested airport in the world,'' said
Clyde McAvoy, Continental Airlines' vice president for the Far
East. He said Narita, only 10 years old, and a new airport under
construction at Osaka were structured ``as very sophisticated
non-tariff barriers.''
   ``By pleading a lack of facilities, Japan in effect is in a
position to curtail competition,'' he said.
   Continental's tactic is to use the island of Guam as a hub
rather than Narita. To avoid Narita's crowded check-in area, the
airline will pick up first- and business-class passengers at their
Tokyo hotels and drive them to Narita in luxury vans, checking them
in during the ride.
   Such competitive wrinkles _ United offers a concierge to
shepherd business- and first-class passengers _ reflect the
scramble for well-heeled Japanese travelers. ``They are a wonderful
consumer to do business with once you earn their loyalty,'' said
McAvoy.
   Statistics from 1987, the most recent year obtainable, show 12.5
million people arriving and departing Japan on routes to the U.S.
mainland, Hawaii, Micronesia and Southeast Asia including Hong
Kong. The number of Japanese travelers to the United States totaled
1.7 million in 1986 and 2.4 million in the first 11 months of 1988.
   An economic boom that extends to Southeast Asia is behind the
increase in travel, and it's fueled by decisions in South Korea and
Taiwan to permit their citizens to travel abroad more freely.
   ``We see overall Pacific travel growing 10 to 12 percent a
year,'' said Bill Speicher, United's senior vice president for
Pacific operations, ``and we believe it will continue indefinitely
in the future, while air traffic in the rest of the world is
forecast to grow about 5 percent a year.''
   United has aggressively sought permission to fly the
Chicago-Tokyo route nonstop but was recently turned down by the
U.S. Transportation Department. The issue will come up in
U.S.-Japan talks on air rights scheduled for mid-May.
   What will Japan's attitude be? Norifumi Ide, deputy director for
international air transport in Japan's Ministry of Transport, said
the two countries' airlines are now balanced on the route: Japan
Air Lines and Northwest each can fly Chicago-Tokyo nonstop.
   Ide hinted Japan will reject United's request, though there
might be some flexibility if Washington permits Japanese cargo
flights on the Chicago route.
   ``U.S. companies, Flying Tigers and Northwest, have enjoyed a
monopoly for many years in that important cargo market,'' Ide said.
``We always table it (in U.S.-Japan negotiations). It is a symbol
of the imbalanced relationship in favor of the U.S.''
   United's Speicher, speaking in a telephone interview from
Hawaii, implied a willingness to see more competition than the U.S.
government now permits.
   ``We will have to find ways in negotiations to accommodate both
sides.'' Speicher said
   Japan Air Lines, which carried 1.2 million trans-Pacific
passengers in the first half of fiscal 1988, a 10.3 percent
increase over the comparable period a year earlier, urges that
competition not be unleashed as happened in the deregulated U.S.
aviation market.
   ``The industry would be dragged into the chaos of price wars and
oversupply,'' JAL board member Yoshiyasu Mayumi warned in a recent
speech.
   The Transport Ministry has a chart showing U.S. airlines with
all the advantages: 19 U.S. gateway cities to 11 permitted to
Japanese carriers; five points in Japan to three used by Japanese
trans-Pacific flights; nine ``beyond points'' in Asia for U.S.
carriers but only one (Rio de Janeiro) permitted to Japanese
airlines flying to the United States; seven U.S. airlines compared
with three Japanese; 380 U.S. flights in and out of Japan each week
to 210 for Japanese airlines.
   One Transport Ministry official, asking not to be named,
criticized what he called ``predatory American carriers coming in
and ripping off our backyard.''
   The Americans disagree. Northwest's Tokyo spokesman, Doug
Killian, said that Japan Air Lines ``also uses Narita for a hub to
Southeast Asia and other points, so there is a similar route
pattern (to the U.S. airlines). We don't feel like everything is
balanced in favor of the U.S. carriers.''
   Northwest is embarking on what it calls its ``most aggressive
single-year route expansion'' in the 42 years it has operated in
the Pacific, launching six new Pacific routes. It was the first to
bring the new Boeing 747-400 jumbo to Tokyo, where it was blessed
by a Shinto priest.

   The haggard wraith at Changi International
Airport didn't have to speak. His gray unshaven face and rumpled
clothes signaled bad news for my attempt to fly to London without a
confirmed reservation.
   ``I've been here three days,'' he said as we hung around the
transfer desk with dozens of people begging for seats out of
Singapore to London, Frankfurt, Bombay, Tokyo and elsewhere.
   Days later, when I was close to resolving my problem, a
Singapore Airlines agent advised, ``Don't pay for a ticket unless
you get a confirmed reservation.''
   But what if plans change? I had a confirmed reservation to
London earlier but stayed in Thailand a few days longer than
expected. Now I was waylaid in an airport with the same name as the
famed Japanese POW camp of World War II .
   My unshaven companion, a West German, said he had suffered a
minor injury while vacationing in Thailand. `I decided it was best
to go home right away,'' he said. He reached Singapore easily but
got stuck trying for a seat to Frankfurt.
   What do you do here for three days?
   ``No clothes, no shave, just wait,'' he said.
   An hour later came news that I and 27 other standbys wouldn't be
flying to London that night on Singapore Airlines. The plane was
full, like nine of 11 flights I took in four weeks of travel on
Asian airlines starting from Tokyo, up and down Southeast Asia, on
to London and back to Tokyo via Singapore.
   Statistics show travel in Asia on a steep up curve, and I can
vouch for that. Airports were jammed. Tourism in the region may be
held back only by a shortage of planes and airport gates.
   When my Thai Airways International Airbus landed on the tropical
paradise island of Phuket, the first big rush was not to the
sparkling beaches but to the airport desk to reconfirm your seat
out _ essential if you want peace of mind while watching the sunset
over the Andaman Sea.
   Back to Changi. I decided not to be a prisoner of the airport,
though I started to wonder when my first five choices of hotel were
all full. Finally a room was available and I spent two days
exploring Singapore before I got a standby seat to London.
   Why are the planes so full? I asked during a visit to a
Singapore Airlines ticket office.
   ``People want to have a good time now. Now they have money,''
the agent replied, as if tomorrow the bubble would burst.

<HEAD>Minorco Wins A Majority Stake In Gold Fields, Has Another 21 Days</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Minorco SA said Wednesday enough shareholders have
accepted its hostile $6 billion bid for Consolidated Gold Fields
PLC to give the South African-controlled bidder a majority stake
and another three weeks to proceed with the offer.
   If it hadn't won the majority stake, Minorco's offer, the
equivalent of 3.5 billion pounds, would have expired at 1 p.m.
Wednesday.
   ``We are naturally pleased at the market's judgement and will
now consider very carefully what action to take,'' said Chairman
Sir Michael Edwardes said.
   Gold Fields Chairman Rudolph Agnew responded, ``We don't believe
that it is in the interests of Gold Fields and its shareholders for
Minorco to gain control. We don't intend to be swayed from our
responsibilities by the bully-boy tactics of Minorco.''
   The takeover of the British gold mining giant would be Britain's
largest corporate acquisition ever. The battle has been a
protracted and expensive one.
   Minorco, the Luxembourg-based investment arm of the South
African Oppenheimer family's gold and diamond mining interests,
said it had counted acceptances from holders of 53.21 million Gold
Fields shares, representing 24.9 percent of all Gold Fields' stock.
   Together with the nearly 30 percent already owned by Minorco,
the acceptances bring its stake to 54.84 percent, or 117.16 million
shares.
   That means that under British takeover regulations, Minorco now
has 21 days to clear up any other outstanding conditions on the bid.
   Principal among these is the lifting of a preliminary injunction
issued by a U.S. court that bars Minorco from purchasing more than
30 percent of Gold Fields shares.
   On Monday, the U.S. court refused to lift the injunction, which
arose from an antitrust suit.
   ``The (U.S. antitrust) litigation will proceed to a full
trial,'' Agnew said Wednesday.
   Minorco has twice sweetened its offer since it first launched it
in September. It currently is offering half a Minorco share and
11.75 pounds in cash for every Gold Fields share.
   Gold Fields has fought the offer vigorously, offering its
shareholders a special dividend if it doesn't meet it own earnings
targets. It has raised concerns about the concentration of control
over the world's gold supplies and potential harmful effects to
Gold Fields from being owned by a South African-controlled company.
   Minorco is 60 percent owned by Anglo American Corp. and De Beers
Consolidated Mines Ltd., the Oppenheimers' gold and diamond mining
giants.

<HEAD>On Secretary's Day, Xerox Announces Quietest Ribbon Typewriter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PETER COY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Xerox Corp. chose National Secretary's Day to
unveil what it calls the world's quietest ribbon typewriter, a
machine nearly as quiet as a computer keyboard.
   The typewriters introduced Wednesday use a patented technology
that gives the printer heads the vibrational characteristics of a
hammer weighing nearly 35 pounds, Xerox said. That makes them
vibrate at a pitch nearly six octaves lower than usual, almost
inaudible to the human ear.
   The quiet typewriters could help Xerox take some business from
International Business Machines Corp., the market leader in
top-of-the-line typewriters for Fortune 1000 companies, said Julie
Voss, a consultant at Venture Development Corp. in Natick, Mass.
   The big question is whether customers will pay the extra $300
Xerox is asking for the feature, said Anthony Polifrone, a vice
president of Buyers Laboratory in Hackensack, N.J.
   ``There's no doubt that the machine is incredibly quiet,'' he
said.
   Xerox is the traditional No. 2 in the big-business market,
although it fell to third in 1988 because of a big federal
government order to an importer of Japanese-made typewriters.
   The Xerox 62 Series typewriters have six patents and five more
pending, which should make it impossible for competitors to copy
the noise-reducing characteristics, said Andrew Gabor, the inventor.
   Gabor is the co-inventor of the daisywheel printer system, which
was brought to market in 1972 when he was at Diablo Systems. His
company was acquired by Xerox a short time later. He is a senior
research fellow at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in Silicon
Valley.
   Gabor at a news conference Wednesday demonstrated a 1960s-era
IBM Selectric with a golf ball-type head (noisy), two earlier
models of Xerox Memorywriters with daisywheels (quieter), and the
new 62 Series (soft clacking).
   Thermal printing typewriters, in which marks are burned onto the
page, are even quieter than the new Xerox models, but they have
drawbacks such as the inability to handle carbons and multi-part
forms. Xerox said its research found 65 percent of all secretarial
typing involves multi-part forms.
   The 6225 model is $1,995 and the 6240 model, which includes a
disk drive for memory storage, is $2,595. Xerox said those prices
are about $300 above corresponding models that are noisier.
   Xerox said the 62 Series produces 52 decibels at 20 characters
per second, which it said is 15 decibels less than other designs.
Ms. Voss, using different decibel numbers, said the Xerox models
would displace Canon's AP 800 as the quiet champion.
   The lower vibrational pitch is achieved by rigidly connecting
the print tip to several heavy elements inside the typewriter,
including a connecting rod and print bail. The greater mass
produces a lower tone, much as a thick, long piano wire produces a
lower tone than a thin, short one.
   Gabor said patent examiners were so incredulous about the
achievement that they demanded a demonstration, which Gabor and
others gave in a hotel conference room in Washington.

<HEAD>Koito Questions Pickens' Share Ownership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Koito Manufacturing Co. demanded
Wednesday that U.S. takeover specialist T. Boone Pickens Jr.
disclose whether he is the real owner of the shares he is using to
claim management rights as Koito's largest shareholder.
   Three weeks ago, Pickens bought 20.2 percent of the shares of
Koito, an auto parts manufacturer closely linked with Toyota Motor.
In a highly publicized visit to Tokyo last week, he demanded
management rights as a shareholder in a direct challenge to deeply
entrenched Japanese business convention, which generally abhors
anything that smacks of a hostile takeover.
   In a letter to Pickens, Koito President Takao Matsuura said,
``Substantial questions have been raised concerning the nature of
Boone Co.'s ownership of Koito shares _ questions which you have
pointedly declined to answer in your recent statements to the
press.''
   Matsuura noted that speculation ``concerning whether Boone Co.
is in fact the real owner of these shares subject to the full
economic risk of its investment.''
   In the letter, Matsuura declined to answer Pickens' earlier
written request for three seats on Koito's board of directors until
Pickens disclosed whether he had an option, repurchase or security
agreement with a Japanese shareholder.
   The Japanese press has speculated Pickens may have an agreement
to sell back the block of shares he bought from Kitaro Watanabe's
Azabu Motors Co., to bring profits both to himself and the company.
   Such an agreement would allow Watanabe to use Picken's
internationally known name to up the ante in a greenmail bid
against Toyota Motor, which owns 19.1 percent of Koito, the press
reports suggested.
   An agreement for Azabu Motors to buy back the shares at a fixed
price would protect Pickens from a loss.
   In corporate greenmail, an investor aqcuires a large block of a
company's shares, threatening to take it over. The greenmailer then
profits when a friendly company saves the target company by buying
the shares at a higher price.
   Pickens has denied any greenmail effort in the Koito share
purchase.
   Analysts say the negative reaction of the Tokyo markets to
Pickens' action is reflected in the share price of Koito, which
closed Wednesday at 4,350 yen, or $33.21, down from a 5,470 yen
high the week before Pickens' purchase and below the 4,830 yen
price shortly after the purchase was announced.
   In the United States, share prices usually rise when there is a
greenmail attempt.

<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The board of Goodman Fielder Wattie
Ltd. said Wednesday it had rejected as inadequate a $2.4 billion
takeover offer from Ranks Hovis McDougall PLC of Britain.
   The directors said in a statement the bid ``doesn't reflect the
underlying value of the company.''
   They also said a takeover by Ranks Hovis would result in the
loss of effective Australasian control over ``vital elements of the
local food industry.'' Goodman Fielder Wattie is the biggest food
processor in Australia and New Zealand.
   The board also called the offer highly conditional, and
criticized the fact it is denominated in British pounds and would
expose shareholders to exchange-rate movements.
   The directors also said Ranks Hovis has not clarified its
intentions about possible asset sales and the future of Goodman
Fielder Wattie's 20,000 employees.
   Ranks Hovis said Wednesday it had raised its stake in Goodman
Fielder Wattie to 14.9 percent through purchases on stock markets
in Australia and London.
   The British company's offer to buy Goodman Fielder Wattie is
worth 3.1 million Australian dollars.
   Ranks Hovis said it would offer stock valued at 3.07 Australian
dollars per share for Goodman Fielder. The offer is four new Ranks
Hovis shares for every 11 Goodman Fielder shares and a cash
alternative of 2.71 Australian dollars a share on the full bid.
   Ranks Hovis' offer was conditioned on it gaining acceptance for
at least 50 percent of Goodman Fielder shares and Australian
government approval.

<TEXT>
   With his bushy mustache and bell-bottom
sideburns, Paul A. Bilzerian looks more like an early-'70s campus
radical than a corporate raider who plopped down $1.06 billion to
muscle a takeover of Singer Co.
   He surprised Wall Street with hardball tactics that helped him
make more than $50 million in four failed takeovers before a
stunning victory in a battle for the former sewing machine company
turned electronics defense contractor.
   Bilzerian now is breaking ground in another way: His trial on
securities fraud charges set to start Monday will be the first
courtroom test of government efforts to prosecute so-called stock
``parking'' schemes.
   Bilzerian, 38, a Harvard Business School graduate and Vietnam
veteran, is charged with 11 counts of securities and tax fraud,
conspiracy and making false disclosures in what the government
describes as a two-year lawbreaking spree.
   His trial at Manhattan federal court _ the OK Corral for defense
lawyers and prosecutors in the more than three-year crackdown on
Wall Street crime _ also will test anew the credibility of a key
government informant, stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies.
   Jefferies has given the government information for several
indictments in exchange for leniency in his sentencing on two
felonies. He was the main witness in the GAF Corp. stock
manipulation case _ which has twice ended in a mistrial, a major
setback for the government.
   `If they go after a second major case and lose it they've got a
real problem,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a securities law
professor at Columbia University Law School.
   Bilzerian is accused of conspiring with Jefferies, who ran a Los
Angeles brokerage bearing his name, to violate securities laws in
the attempted takeovers of Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Hammermill Paper
Co., and H.H. Robertson Co., and a stock sale in Armco Inc., in
1985 and 1986.
   The deals all included stock arrangements that have been chased
by the Securities and Exchange Commission for years but gained
prominence during the scandals that engulfed the business world in
the mid-1980s.
   Stock parking refers to the sale or transfer of securities to
conceal true ownership and avoid federal disclosure or tax laws.
Under a typical parking arrangement, someone buys stock with the
secret understanding that the real owner will repurchase it at a
set later date.
   While parking itself is not defined anywhere as a crime, any
``willful'' violation of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act can
be prosecuted criminally.
   ``I might give (stock) to you if I was going to Antarctica for
two years and I wanted it safely kept,'' said Sam Scott Miller, a
New York securities lawyer. ``There's no crime if we're not trying
to evade disclosure or tax requirements.''
   The parking charges in the Bilzerian case allege the Tampa,
Fla., investor sought to conceal his level of ownership to mask
possible takeover bids. SEC laws require public disclosure when 5
percent of a company is acquired.
   Other cases _ including plea deals made by Jefferies and
imprisoned inside trader Ivan Boesky _ have charged violators with
temporarily swapping stock for cash to allow them to take positions
larger than their capital base would permit.
   But defense lawyers maintain the government is attempting to
criminalize highly technical securities regulations, a tactic one
attorney equated with ``trying to shoot a butterly with a cannon.''
   They say such violations should be dealt with by the SEC, which
has the power to levy huge fines and ban broker-dealers from the
securities business for life.
   ``It's against the law but people had never thought of that as
something that should be prosecuted as a crime as opposed to
something that should be dealt with by regulators,'' said Gandolfo
V. DiBlasi, a New York securities litigator.
   Added Arthur F. Mathews, Bilzerian's lawyer: ``The government is
trying to stretch and make criminal something that has never been
prosecuted before criminally.''
   Parking activities have been included in the SEC's case against
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office
indictment of Drexel financier Michael Milken as well as the Boesky
and Jefferies cases.
   It will have a high courtroom profile in the Bilzerian case, and
the racketeering and fraud cases against defunct Princeton-Newport
Partners LP and Milken, which charge overlapping parking schemes.
   ``The line between civil and criminal law is wavy in this
area,'' said Columbia's Goldschmid.
   ``Fundamentally if something nasty is being done in terms of the
parking it seems legitimate to criminalize the area,'' he said.
``The problem is that too extensive a use of the criminal law may
trivialize enforcement.''
   Bilzerian's January 1988 takeover of Stamford, Conn.-based
Singer is not mentioned in the indictment. He has denied all
charges and faces a maximum five years in jail and $250,000 fine on
each count.
   Since becoming chairman of Singer, Blizerian has gradually
dismantled the defense contractor, selling off its 12 operating
units and making an estimated $100 million above his acquisition
costs.

<TEXT>
   Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc., the world's leading
maker of contact lenses, has decided that it's not a good idea to
wear extended-wear soft contact lenses continuously for more than a
week without removing and cleaning them.
   Wednesday's announcement may be the first indication that the
end is near for the soft contact lens that can be worn for long
periods of time.
   ``I think you'll see the FDA come out with a similar policy very
soon,'' said Dr. Michael Lemp, professor and chairman of the Center
for Sight at Georgetown Medical School in Washington.
   Extended-wear lenses, first introduced in 1984, are currently
approved by the Federal Drug Administration for continuous wear of
up to 30 days. There are about 4.6 million Americans who wear
extended-wear lenses.
   Lemp said a recent, as yet unpublished, study conducted at the
Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston, has indicated that
the longer lenses are worn continuously, the greater the risk to
the eyeball's outer coating, the cornea.
   ``My own impression, is that people have been shying away from
extended-wear lenses for a long time because of safety concerns,''
Lemp said Wednesday. ``This announcement says that seven days is an
acceptable time period.''
   A spokeswoman at the FDA in Rockville, Md., said the agency was
reviewing its policy about extended-wear lenses and would probably
issue a statement next week.
   But Carol Herman, a spokeswoman in an FDA office that is
concerned with the safe use of medical devices, said the agency is
drafting a letter urging the nation's eight major contact lens
makers to voluntarily change their labels and packaging to reflect
a seven-day, instead of a 30-day, maximum.
   The question of the safety of extended-wear lenses has been
hotly debated in the eye care industry for the past five years.
   ``Our review of the research tells us that ... the risk of
complication increases at longer-wearing periods,'' said Hal
Johnson, president of the professional products division at Bausch
&amp; Lomb.
   The company sent a telegram to 30,000 ophthalmologists and
optometrists around the country Monday recommending that
extended-wear lenses only be prescribed for seven days' continuous
use, rather than 30 days.
   ``We believe that successful wear is most easily achieved within
the seven-day window. We're saying at or before seven days, the
lenses should be removed, cleaned and disinfected,'' said Johnson.
   The much-talked about Boston study, which examined both
daily-wear and extended-wear soft contact lenses, has been
completed, but is being examined by statisticians to ensure
accuracy, said Regina Kilfoyle, a spokesman the Eye and Ear
Infirmary, a hospital affiliated with Harvard Medical School.
   Results from the study have been made available to contact lens
makers and some eye doctors, but they have not been published and
are still being confirmed, she said.

   The stock market drifted in a narrow range today
in an inconclusive response to the latest data on the state of the
economy.
   The Commerce Department reported this morning that the nation's
gross national product rose at a 5.5 percent annual rate, after
adjustment for inflation, in the first quarter of the year.
   Without the effects of last year's drought, however, the agency
said the growth rate would have been just 3 percent.
   So analysts concluded that the figures provided support for the
belief that economic growth lately has been losing momentum as the
Federal Reserve has sought to restrain inflation.
   But the inflation figures that accompanied the GNP report were
not so encouraging, brokers said, indicating that prices were still
rising at a 5 percent to 5.5 percent annual rate.

<TEXT>
   About 100 striking United Mine Workers
members were arrested Wednesday and other UMW members used their
cars to block entrances to a coal preparation plant in the third
day of civil disobedience aimed at shutting down Pittston Coal
Group operations.
   The miners were arrested when they tried to block the entrance
to Pittston's Lambert Fork mine near Dante, said Lt. J.D. Willis of
the Virginia State Police.
   ``We took them away in buses and tried to disembark them for
processing at several places in Dickenson County but were turned
away because of crowd control problems,'' Willis said.
   Miners also blocked both entrances to Pittston's Moss No. 3
preparation plant by parking their cars on both sides of the road,
leaving space for passenger cars but not coal trucks. State police
sealed off the road and called two tow trucks, whose drivers
refused to tow away the cars.
   At least 600 miners have been arrested since the civil
disobedience tactics _ largely blocking roads and mine entrances _
went into effect Monday.
   About 1,700 UMW members have been on strike at Pittston mines in
Virginia and West Virginia since April 5. The miners had been
working without a contract for 14 months, and the union accused
Pittston of engaging in unfair labor practices during negotiations,
a claim Pittston denies.
   The UMW was joined Monday by 750 Westmoreland Coal Co. workers
the union called off the job for three of the 10 ``memorial days''
_ or personal days _ permitted under their contract.
   The union also has called selective strikes Monday at three
non-Pittston operations in West Virginia. About 100 miners are
striking Gilbert Imported Hardwoods Inc. and Lynn Land Co. in Mingo
County and Belva Coal Co. in Logan County.
   Those also miners had been working without a contract since
February 1988.
   ``We're looking closely at several other independent companies
that have also failed to negotiate successor agreements,'' said UMW
District 17 President Bob Phalen in Charleston, W.Va.
   Phalen refused to say whether there will be additional walkouts.

   Transamerica Corp.'s earnings more than
doubled in the first quarter because of a one-time charge that
reduced earnings in the year-earlier period, the company said
Wednesday.
   Transamerica had first-quarter earnings of $70.8 million, or 89
cents a share, compared to $30.7 million, or 36 cents per share in
the same quarter of 1988, the financial services company said.
   Revenue totaled $1.59 billion, up from a restated $1.53 billion
a year earlier.
   However, the company pointed out in a statement that results for
1988 included a $36.9 million one-time reduction for ``the
cumulative effect of a change in accounting for income taxes.''
   Operating income for the three months ended March 31 was $70.8
million, or 89 cents a share, up 5 percent from $67.6 million, or
85 cents per share, a year ago.

   The dollar pushed higher Wednesday against all
major currencies in brisk trading after the government released its
latest data on economic growth.
   Gold prices declined. Republic National Bank of New York quoted
a troy ounce of gold at $384.50 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down 25 cents
from late Tuesday.
   Currency traders said that sentiment toward the dollar remains
strong and escalated after the Commerce Department's gross national
product report was released.
   The agency said the economy, as measured by GNP, expanded at a
robust annual rate of 5.5 percent the first three months of 1989,
the fastest pace in over a year.
   About half of that increase came from a catch-up from last
year's drought. Without the farm sector, the growth rate would have
been just 3 percent, down from a 3.5 percent non-farm growth rate
in the 1988 fourth quarter.
   Robert Ryan, senior trader for Irving Trust Co., said the
currency market interpreted the report as bullish for the dollar,
nonetheless, because it meant interest rates probably would remain
firm in the near term to combat signs of inflation.
   Ryan said technical factors and rising oil prices, particularly
in wholesale gasoline, also helped push the dollar higher.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar rose to 131.47 Japanese yen from 131.17 Tuesday.
The dollar traded higher in London at 132.00 yen, and in New York
at 132.105 yen, up from 131.475 yen late Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6932 late Wednesday,
cheaper for buyers than Tuesday's late $1.7030. Sterling fetched
$1.6900 in New York, down from $1.69945.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's levels, included: 1.8793 West German marks, up from
1.86655; 1.6580 Swiss francs, up from 1.64625; 1.18955 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.18925; 6.3595 French francs, up from 6.3175; and
1,377.375 Italian lire, up from 1,367.20.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Tuesday's rates
included: 1.8770 West German marks, up from 1.8625; 1.6555 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6435; 6.3395 French francs, up from 6.3065;
2.1150 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1000; 1,374.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,366.00; and 1.1900 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1910.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery fell to $385.30 a troy ounce from $385.70 late Tuesday.
   The late gold bid in London was $384.25 an ounce, down from
$385.75 late Tuesday. The Zurich late bid was $383.50 an ounce,
down from $385.00.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $384.55 an ounce, down
from $385.65.
   Silver prices also lost ground. On the New York Comex, silver
bullion for current delivery was bid at $5.763 a troy ounce, down
from $5.789. Silver fell in London to $5.77 an ounce from $5.81.

   Compaq Computer Corp., citing strong sales
overseas, on Wednesday reported first-quarter profits of $83
million, up 78 percent from the $47 million in the same period a
year ago.
   The earnings, which amounted to $1.95 per share, up from $1.21

percent from $439 million in the three-month period ending March
31, 1988.
   In spite of the big gain, Compaq's stock fell because of
statements by the company to analysts that forecasts of $8 a share
in 1989 earnings were aggressive though achievable.
   The stock fell $1.50 a share to $77.75 in consolidated New York
Stock Exchange trading.
   ``Compaq sales outside North America were particularly strong,
accounting for 46 percent of first-quarter revenue,'' Rod Canion,
president and chief executive officer, said in a written statement.
   Sales of some products were limited by lack of supply, Canion

<TEXT>
   Union Carbide Corp. shareholders on Wednesday
soundly rejected a proposal that the company provide humanitarian
relief to Bhopal, India, where a 1984 gas leak from a company plant
killed more than 3,000 people.
   ``That should be the last of the direct financial effects of the
Bhopal tragedy,'' Robert D. Kennedy, chairman and chief executive
officer of Union Carbide, said after an orderly two-hour meeting.
   In their first meeting since the company reached a $470 million
damage settlement with the Indian government in February,
shareholders also approved formation of a holding company and
establishment of its domestic and plastics business as a
wholly-owned subsidiary.
   But most of the focus Wednesday was on the settlement, which
protesters decried as inadequate.
   The Dec. 2-3, 1984, leak of poisonous methyl isocyanate gas from
a Union Carbide chemical plant in Bhopal left an estimated 20,000
people injured, according to government statistics. Activist groups
cite figures of 4,000 dead and 200,000 injured.
   The Supreme Court of India on Feb. 14 directed the Danbury,
Conn.-based company to pay $470 million ``in full settlement of all
claims, rights and liabilities related to and arising out of the
Bhopal gas disaster.''
   Minority shareholders, including church-affiliated groups, had
introduced a resolution urging that the company take additional
steps to provide immediate humanitarian relief to India, but it was
rejected by 93 percent of the voting shareholders.
   Shareholders also rejected a resolution to sell Union Carbide's
South African holdings.
   Kennedy said the company had attempted to provide additional,
direct aid to the people of Bhopal, but the government rejected the
effort. Protesters, including three Bhopal victims touring the
country to draw support for their cause, said the settlement amount
was inadequate.
   About a dozen protesters displayed banners and distributed
information outside before the meeting and several shareholders
called for additional company aid during the meeting.
   ``We are here to tell that this settlement has been rejected by
the people of Bhopal,'' said Satinath Sarangi, who later was
arrested along with three others for trying to enter the Hyatt
Regency Hotel and distribute contradictory reports on the accident.
   ``They do not accept it because they know that this amount is
insufficient to meet the health care requirements (of victims),''
Sarangi said. ``To accept such a settlement is to accept certain
death, and they are not prepared to accept it.''
   The settlement is on appeal and its distribution is being
withheld by the government, Union Carbide said.
   Kennedy said the company was securing the protesters' release
from jail and was not involved in their arrests. He apologized for
the incident and offered to meet with them later.
   ``The end of litigation does not mean that Bhopal is
forgotten,'' Kennedy said. ``Although we have evidence to prove
that a Bhopal employee of Union Carbide India Ltd. sabotaged the
plant, we know the tragedy will always be linked in people's minds
with Union Carbide Corp.''
   The shareholder-approved restructuring, designed for more
efficient use of Union Carbide's multinational operations, creates
a subsidiary to be called Union Carbide Chemicals and Plastics
Company Inc. It joins two other core subsidiaries created in
January: Union Carbide Industrial Gases Inc. and UCAR Carbon
Company Inc.
   The change was approved by more than 85 percent of the voting
shares.
   Kennedy said the restructuring would give management at each
subsidiary more flexibility and authority to respond to changing
markets.

   Mobil Corp., the largest U.S.
holdout in South Africa, may have bowed to political and financial
pressure to disinvest its holdings at fire-sale prices after 90
years of doing business in that country, published reports said
Wednesday.
   Business Day of Johannesburg quoted banking and other sources as
confirming the sale by Mobil of about $400 million in assets for
$150 million to Trek, the largest privately owned oil company in
South Africa.
   The local financial daily also said the Mobil properties would
be sold in separate deals over a period of time.
   Mobil representatives in South Africa and the United States
remained silent about the reports. Jack Lord, spokesman for Mobil
at its New York headquarters, said Wednesday the company had no
comment.
   ``We'd heard rumors they'd been doing contingency plans for
withdrawal,'' said Diane Bratcher, a spokeswoman for the Interfaith
Center on Corporate Responsibility, a New York-based church group
that pressures American companies to leave South Africa. ``It sort
of flies in the face of everything they've been saying.''
   News of the possible sale sent Trek shares soaring 15.3 percent
from Monday to Tuesday on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Trek is
a subsidiary of General Mining Union Corp., a South Africa mining
conglomerate.
   Mobil employs almost 2,800 people in South Africa and has been a
symbol of foreign business reluctance to leave the country, despite
widespread condemnation of the white-minority government's
suppression of the black majority in the system known as apartheid.
   Partly because of South Africa's race policies, more than 170
American companies have withdrawn over the last four years. Most
have sold their operations at low prices to South
African-controlled business.
   Since Exxon Corp., the largest U.S. oil concern, pulled out of
South Africa in 1986, Mobil had insisted it would not bow to
pressure to disinvest, despite pressure on the company by
anti-apartheid groups in the United States.
   At least two shareholder resolutions exhorting Mobil to vacate
South Africa are on the agenda at the company's annual meeting,
scheduled for May 11.
   The Star of Johannesburg, the nation's largest daily, reported
that ``industry sources confirmed'' Mobil was selling its South
African assets for an estimated 500 million rand, roughly $125
million.
   The Citizen, another Johannesburg daily, quoted ``local and
overseas'' sources as saying that Mobil was considering
disinvesting. The paper said Mobil is the largest non-South African
controlled employer in the country with 1,000 gasoline stations, a
$225 million investment in an oil refinery, and a distribution
network.

<TEXT>
   The Federal Communications Commission on
Wednesday granted media magnate Rupert Murdoch's request to
transfer his Boston televison station to a trust to comply with
cross-ownership rules.
   The FCC, in a 3-0 vote, said Murdoch's Twentieth Holdings Corp.
could turn over UHF station WFXT in Boston, where Murdoch's News
America Publishing owns the Boston Herald, to trustees Edward W.
Brooke, the former U.S. senator from Massachusetts, and Hugh L.
Carey, the former New York governor.
   But the commission said that to assure the station was properly
``insulated'' from Murdoch and his affiliate companies, which
include the 20th Century Fox film and TV operations, Twentieth
Holdings could not have approval of any possible sale of the
station.
   The commission also said the station could not use programming
from the Fox TV network of stations or be an affiliate of that
network.
   The commission said its no communications standard for broadcast
trusts ``was well established when Twentieth bought the station (in
1986) and that any communication between the trustees and any
Twentieth affiliate, no matter how limited, is prohibitedng
contracts expire.
   Fox has 60 days to comply. It also could ask the FCC to
reconsider, appeal to the courts or ask for a commission hearing on
the conditions. Or it could divest the property.
   Attorneys for Murdoch did not immediately return a call seeking
comment.
   Under terms of the transfer, Murdoch will relinquish control but
still receive profits. The trust will expire if WFXT shares are
sold, if the station stops operations or if the Boston Herald is
sold. The trustees also must use their best efforts to sell the
shares to one buyer and the price must exceed $35 million.
   The station has been valued at between $30 million and $50
million.
   Murdoch engaged in a bitter battle with Congress in 1987 over
his ownership of the two Boston media outlets, as well as his
ownership of the New York Post and WNYW-TV in New York.
   Sens. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., had
pushed a measure through Congress in the waning hours of 1987
prohibiting the FCC from eliminating or modifying the
cross-ownership rules and barring it from extending any waivers to
the rules.
   The Herald at the time, which had been editorializing against
Kennedy, called his congressional action ``a vendetta.''
   The FCC had given Murdoch a waiver allowing him to own both
Boston outlets until June 30, 1988.
   A federal appeals court overturned the congressional action, but
Murdoch decided to seek FCC permission to transfer the station to
the trust. The FCC gave him another extension while it considered
the request.
   Murdoch, through his Australian-based News Corp., owns extensive
newspaper holdings in Europe, North America and Australasia.

<TEXT>
   Airport congestion, deteriorating service,
rising fares and concern about safety have intensified pressure on
the federal government to re-regulate the U.S. airline industry,
economist Alfred E. Kahn said Wednesday.
   Kahn, widely regarded as the primary architect of the
government's October 1987 deregulation of airline fares and routes,
also said there could be a partial re-regulation of the industry.
   Kahn said the public's appraisal of the industry was a ``mixed
bag.'' While deregulation has brought cheaper fares and opened air
travel to larger numbers of Americans, it also has created
congestion and delays, he said.
   ``Clearly, we have been delinquent in failing to expand
supply,'' Kahn told a luncheon organized by New York University's
C.V. Starr Center for Applied Economics.
   More airport capacity and better air traffic control are needed,
but deregulation actually has been accompanied by a decline in the
number of federal flight inspectors, he said.
   Kahn said it was difficult to know whether strikebound Eastern
Airlines would be able to compete rebuilt as a smaller carrier, as
its managers recently proposed.
   Eastern has been operating a drastically reduced schedule since
a March 4 strike by its Machinists, joined by its pilots and flight
attendants unions. Several buyout offers have been made but none
have been acceptable to parent Texas Air Corp., which has indicated
it would reorganize the airline into a roughly one-third smaller
carrier.
   ``It is possible for small, compact airlines to find niches,''
he said in response to a question. But he said it was difficult to
see what Eastern's niche could be and how it could compete such
against expanding rivals as Delta Air Lines and American Airlines.
   ``The race seems to be going to the big airlines,'' said Kahn, a
former chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board.
   Unlike the airlines, other deregulated industries such as
telecommunications and financial markets appear unlikely targets of
re-regulation, Kahn suggested.
   ``I don't see any possibility of putting the technological genie
back in the bottle ... The faith in the market continues
unabated,'' he said. However, if there were a deep economic
depression, ``all bets are off,'' he said.

   Energy futures prices were mixed in active
trading Wednesday with gasoline prices continuing to rise amid
uncertainty over summer supplies.
   Unleaded gasoline for May delivery rose 1.96 cents to finish at
78.12 cents a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Other
contract months also gained.
   Crude oil prices, meanwhile, turned lower after a sharp rally in
the previous session. West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade
of U.S. crude, fell 22 cents to close at $21.19 a barrel. Contracts
for delivery through November were down as much as 33 cents.
   Heating oil contracts also declined, with May down 1.10 cents to
50.98 cents a gallon on the exchange.
   Analysts said ongoing concern about tight gasoline supplies for
summer months helped keep prices firm. The concerns stem partly
from reduced refinery capacity, high demand and new federal octane
regulations that increase the amount of crude oil needed to make
gasoline.
   A weekly report from the American Petroleum Institute added more
bullish news for the market. The report showed that gasoline
inventories fell by more than 2 million barrels in the week ending
April 21.
   The May gasoline contract also got a lift from buyers taking
late positions in advance of the contract's expiration on Friday,
brokers said.
   The weekly API report, meanwhile, helped soften crude prices.
The report showed that crude stocks rose last week by more than 9
million barrels.

<HEAD>GE Awarded $750 Million Contract From Japanese Utility</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Electric Co. has been awarded a
$750 million contract to build a power plant in Japan that will
become the world's largest combined-cycle power plant, the
company's top executive announced Wednesday.
   ``This is the largest fossil generation order ever for GE,'' GE
Chairman John F. Welch Jr. told shareholders during the company's
annual stockholders meeting here.
   Tokyo Electric Power Co., a privately owned utility, awarded the
contract to GE. Once in operation, the combined-cycle power plant
will be capable of generating 2,600 megawatts of power _ 600
megawatts more than the world's largest combined-cycle plant
currently in operation, Welch said.
   Combined-cycle power plants use the exhaust heat from a gas
turbine to generate steam, which in turn drives a steam turbine,
thus generating power from energy that would have been wasted.
   The power plant is scheduled to begin commercial service in the
Tokyo area in the mid-1990s.
   All eight of the proposed power plant's gas turbines will be
manufactured in GE's Greenville plant and the eight steam turbines
and hydrogen-cooled generators will be manufactured in GE's
facilities in Schenectady, N.Y.
   The order from Toyko Electric comes on the heels on a $250
million order from Duke Power Co. in March.
   During the shareholders' meeting, held amid heavy security and
marked with often heated exchanges among GE executives and
shareholder-activists, Welch said the company would try to become
``simpler, faster'' and more ``self-confident'' during the 1990s.
   GE, which employs about 298,000 workers worldwide, reported
sales of $50 billion in 1988. Profits for the year were $3.9
billion, slightly less than the gross national product of Costa
Rica.
   ``GE is one of the best corporations to direct the attack on
nuclear weapons because it's one of the largest manufacturers of
nuclear weapons,'' said Bill Stuart Whistler, a former GE employee
now with an organization called Infact.
   The Boston-based group initiated a boycott against Nestle Foods
Corp. several years ago and is now promoting a boycott against GE's
involvement in the manufacture of nuclear weapons.
   At the shareholders meeting, Infact requested that GE's board of
directors play ``an active role to ensure that the company conduct
itself more ethically.''
   The group asked GE's board to provide information to the public
on GE's activities that ``dramatically impact on our health and
lives,'' and participate in public forums to address those issues.

   The board of directors of Anheuser-Busch Cos.
Inc. on Wednesday approved creation of employee stock ownership
plans that will borrow $500 million and use the proceeds to buy
common stock from the company at the market price.
   The ESOP shares will be allocated to participants over the next
15 years as contributions are made to the plans.
   The company said the plan will enhance stock ownership of
employee participants and improve shareholder value.
   In a related move, the board authorized the purchase by the
company of up to 15 million shares of company stock in addition to
previously announced repurchase plans.
   Anheuser-Busch also announced record first-quarter earnings of
$167.1 million, up 9.6 percent from net income of $152.4 million
for the same period in 1988. Earnings per share increased to 58
cents, up 13.7 percent from 51 cents in the first quarter last year.
   Gross sales were reported at $2.4 billion, up 5.9 percent from
$2.26 billion a year ago.

<TEXT>
   The government reported Wednesday the U.S.
economy topped the $5 trillion mark for the first time last
quarter, powered by a strong 5.5 percent growth rate that caused
some analysts to express concern about rising inflation.
   Even discounting for a statistical bounceback from the 1988
drought, a major factor in the overall increase, the gross national
product grew at a solid 3 percent annual rate during the
January-March period, the Commerce Department reported.
   The stock market's response was inconclusive, with stock values
drifting in a narrow range. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
edged up 2.20 to 2,3889.11.
   J. Antonio Villamil, chief economist for the Commerce
Department, said the economy's performance in the first quarter
``appears to be consistent with moderate, sustainable growth for
the balance of the year'' and contains no threat of a recession.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said the growth pattern, in
which the pace of consumer spending slowed while exports and
business investment rose, was ``a desirable one for the
sustainability of the economic expansion.''
   Private analysts cautioned, however, that the report offered
some troubling indications that inflation was accelerating.
   A GNP index that measures prices for a fixed marketbasket of
goods and services rose at an annual rate of 5 percent in the first
quarter, up from 4.2 percent during the previous three months.
   While half of the increase was linked to a pay raise for
government employees, ``certainly it suggests we're in a period of
accelerating inflation,'' said economist David Jones of Aubrey G.
Lanston &amp; Co. in New York.
   Robert G. Dederick, chief economist for Northern Trust Co. in
Chicago, said the economy's strong growth in the first quarter was
``too much of a good thing.''
   ``The report suggested that the economy was still growing at a
rate too fast for comfort and the manifestation of this was in the
inflation figure,'' Dederick said. ``No matter what you look at,
the inflation worry is there.''
   Villamil said that discounting the effects of the pay raise and
recent food and energy price increases, the underlying inflation
rate seems to be holding ``at a stable lower level of about 4 or 4{
percent.''
   The nation's total output reached an annual rate of $5.117
trillion last quarter before adjusting for inflation, the first
time it had exceeded $5 trillion. After adjusting for price
increases, the GNP rose at an annual rate of $4.088 trillion last
quarter, up $54.8 billion from the previous quarter.
   The 5.5 percent annual rate of growth was the highest since a
6.1 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1987.
   It reflected an improvement in the trade deficit after two
negative quarters, as exports rose 10.6 percent while imports
advanced just 2.3 percent, and a strong 9.6 percent increase in
business investment.
   Some signs of a softening in economic growth were evident as
well, in a 3.6 percent decline in housing construction and a slim
1.3 percent increase in consumer spending, the slowest growth in a
year.
   The drought-discounted figure for the overall economy _ a growth
rate of 3 percent _ was down only slightly from the 3.5 percent
pace at which the non-farm economy grew during the final three
months of 1988. When the drought's effects are added in, the
country's total output of goods and services grew at a 2.4 percent
pace during the fourth quarter.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said the spending patterns were of just the right mix to prolong
the economic expansion without causing prices to surge.
   ``Clearly 3 percent economic growth is sustainable and does not
add to inflationary pressures,'' he said.
   While the overall GNP figure for the first quarter was a strong
one, a series of government reports that chronicle monthly economic
activity suggest that growth began to slow as the three-month
period progressed.
   Most analysts expect the economy to cool further as the year
continues in response to a yearlong campaign by the Federal Reserve
Board to restrain inflation by driving up interest rates and
dampening demand.
   ``Within the quarter, the economy's growth apparently slowed
dramatically,'' Dederick said. ``Unless the economy begins to get
some new fuel in the second quarter, the growth is likely to be a
lot slower.''
   Some analysts worry that the Fed's anti-inflation campaign may
prove so potent that it unintentionally pushes the country into a
recession late this year or early in 1989, but others are
optimistic the central bank will be able to restrain growth just
enough to control prices without halting the expansion.
   Many analysts expect growth for the year overall to be around
2.7 percent, down significantly from the 3.9 percent recorded in
1988 and also below the Bush administration's forecast of 3.2
percent.

<HEAD>Platinum Prices Rise As Confidence In Market Grows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Platinum futures prices surged on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on Wednesday following published reports in Japan that
prices could regain the $600 an ounce levels of late 1988.
   On other markets, gasoline prices rose sharply while crude oil
and heating oil prices fell; pork prices rallied but cattle were
little changed; grain and soybeans were mixed, and cocoa prices
plunged.
   Platinum settled $9 dollars higher across the board, with July
at $557.30 a troy ounce.
   Platinum prices were trading near $600 an ounce last year, but
the market collapsed in mid-December after the Ford Motor Co.,
announced its development of a platinum-free catalytic converter.
   Platinum is a key component in most of the automobile
pollution-control devices, which account for a third of the metal's
use worldwide.
   ``A constructive story on platinum in Japan saying the market
could rise to near $600,'' keyed the surge in platinum prices, said
Bernard Savaiko, an analyst with PaineWebber, Inc., in New York.
   Platinum demand is expected to outstrip production into the
1990s, and the market has been rising lately as traders
increasingly focus on supply and demand.
   Gold settled at 40 cents to $1 lower, with June at $388.20 a
troy ounce; silver was 3.2 cents to 3.6 cents lower, with May at
$5.763 a troy ounce.
   Gasoline prices soared on the New York Mercantile Exchange in
hectic activity as traders holding contracts for delivery of
gasoline in May scrambled to escape that obligation ahead of the
contract's expiration this Friday. Crude oil and heating oil prices
fell.
   Crude oil settled 12 cents to 33 cents lower with June at $21.19
a barrel; heating oil was 1.09 cents to 1.43 cents lower with May
at 50.98 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline oil was .30 cent to 1.96
cents higher with May at 78.12 cents a gallon.
   Pork futures rallied strongly for a second day on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange amid speculation that hog marketings will
subside in early May. Cattle futures were little changed.
   Hog slaughters typically slack off and prices typically rise
during May in a normal seasonal pattern. But signs of a seasonal
decline have not surfaced yet, so the market's recent strength has
been almost entirely speculative, said Chuck Levitt, an analyst in
Chicago with Shearson Lehmann Hutton Inc.
   Live cattle settled .05 cent lower to .25 cent higher with June
at 70.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent lower to .25
cent higher with May at 75.90 cents a pound; live hogs were .03
cent lower to .45 cent higher with June at 46.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .65 cent to 1.10 cents higher with May at
32.65 cents a pound.
   Soybean futures prices recovered modestly from two days of steep
declines on the Chicago Board of Trade as traders who sold the
market earlier in the week bought contracts to take profits. Corn
futures prices increased and wheat futures dropped slightly.
   Soybean prices rose amid talk that a strike by Brazilian dock
workers could continue for some time.
   ``The strike may provide the United States with some export
business, although it hasn't so far,'' said Joel Karlin an analyst
for Research Department, Inc. in Chicago.
   Wheat settled 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with May at $4.11 per
bushel; corn was { cent to 1} cents higher, with May at $2.65} per
bushel; oats were 4\ cents to 5} cents lower with May at $1.83\ per
bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 8 cents higher with May at $7.40{
per bushel.
   Cocoa futures fell sharply on the New York Coffee, Sugar and
Cocoa Exchange in response to weakness on the London market and to
greater availability of cocoa.
   Cocoa settled $22 to $45 lower with contract for delivery in May
at $1275 a metric ton.

<HEAD>NCNB May Bid For Texas Banks, McColl Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 7 grafs to CORRECT that NCNB is considering bid for
former MCorp banks, not MCorp itself.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NCNB Corp. Chairman Hugh McColl said Wednesday
that his bank may bid for 20 troubled banks formerly owned by
Dallas-based MCorp, two days after dropping its unsolicited offer
for Citizens and Southern Corp.
   At a news conference following NCNB's annual shareholders'
meeting, McColl said the company had been invited by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. to enter the bidding for the troubled Texas
banks, which were placed in federal receivership last month
following heavy real estate and energy losses. MCorp itself still
operates five banks in Texas.
   ``We don't think we have an edge, but we already have 1,100
people running a bank for the FDIC,'' McColl said. ``We feel we
could do the same for some of their other asset problems.''
   Just four months ago, NCNB effectively doubled its size when it
was selected by the FDIC to acquire the largest bank in Texas,
First Republicbank Corp., also of Dallas. It renamed the bank NCNB
Texas National Bank.
   Francis ``Buddy'' Kemp, chairman of NCNB Texas National Bank,
said acquiring the former MCorp banks was one of several
possibilities for NCNB to expand into new markets in Texas.
   ``There are several markets in which we would like to build on
our strength,'' he said. ``Houston and San Antonio are areas where
we'd like to have more strength.''
   Tim Hartman, a vice chairman of NCNB Texas, said NCNB remained
``several weeks away from making a bid'' for the former MCorp banks.
   NCNB is North Carolina's largest bank with more than $50 billion
in assets.
   If the deal with Citizens and Southern had gone through, it
would have been the largest bank merger in U.S. history and created
a bank with more than $70 billion in assets.
   NCNB launched its $2.4 billion stock-swap bid for Citizens and
Southern on March 30, but it withdrew the offer Monday after
running into a solid wall of resistance from the Atlanta bank's
board of directors.
   ``They rejected our offer for reasons I'm sure were entirely
clear to them,'' McColl told shareholders, ``although they're not
entirely clear to me.''

<HEAD>Vacuum Cleaner Maker Files For Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RAHWAY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financially troubled Regina Co. Inc., a
leading vacuum cleaner maker, filed for bankruptcy protection
Wednesday.
   The petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws was filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Jersey,
the company said in a statement.
   Regina, which produces vacuum cleaners under such brand names
Electrikbroom and Housekeeper, said it anticipates continued
business operations during the pending bankruptcy case.
   Malcolm L. Sherman, chairman of Regina, said the company's
primary secured lenders have agreed to interim financing as a
debtor-in-possession, subject to court approval.
   Analysts have said Regina's problems have been linked partly to
the quality of its Housekeeper line of vacuum cleaners, introduced
about three years ago.
   Two former top officers of Regina are scheduled to be sentenced
in federal court Friday on charges that concerned a $100 million
loss for investors.
   Former Chairman Donald D. Sheelen and former Chief Financial
Officer Vincent P. Golden admitted to falsifying company records to
mislead stockholders and the Securities and Exchange Commission and
to keep stock prices up.
   Sheelen owns more than one-third of the company's 9.1 million
outstanding shares.
   He admitted telling Golden to falsify sales by not subtracting
returned appliances from the company's sales figures.
   They also admitted to inflating company income by $15 million to
$27 million by using falsely reduced cost figures and false
invoices, and reported inflated per-share earnings.
   In September, when the executives resigned, Regina withdrew its
financial statements showing a $10.9 million profit for the year
ended June 30, 1988, on sales of $181.1 million, calling them
inaccurate.
   Its share price, as high as $27 in August, plunged to $3.75 in
October and down to 36 cents a share in January. Earlier this
month, Regina's stock was removed from the NASDAQ over-the-counter
trading system.

   Democrats on the House Banking Committee
overrode objections from the Bush administration and voted
Wednesday to force the troubled savings and loan indusry to
subsidize home buying by poor people.
   With four Democrats joining 20 Republicans in opposition, the
panel voted 27-24 to require the 12 regional Federal Home Loan
Banks to set aside 5 percent of their profits to provide
low-interest loans for housing the working poor.
   The amendment, sponsored by the committee chairman, Rep. Henry
B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, would provide about $75 million a year for
four years and more per year after that. Consumer groups said
that's enough to give 500,000 home buyers a 2 percentage point
break on their mortgages.
   The regional banks, although created by the federal government,
are owned by the S&amp;L industry and pass their profits on to
individual S&amp;Ls. Republicans argued that the regional banks are
already being tapped to pay for part of the industry's bailout and
that further demands will only hurt the chances for restoring the
ailing industry to health.
   ``To play social games with this legislation at this point in
time, I think, would jeopardize confidence in the system,'' said
Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
   Democrats, however, said the Gonzalez amendment amounted to a
modest subsidy to the poor in a bill that was providing more than
$100 billion to protect S&amp;L depositors and said without it there
was little reason for a separate savings industry.
   ``If we don't subsidize low-income housing, they're going to be
the only people who don't get subsidized in this bill,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.
   The four Democrats siding with the GOP were Reps. Frank Annunzio
of Illinois, Stephen L. Neal of North Carolina, Carroll Hubbard Jr.
of Kentucky and Doug Barnard Jr of Georgia.
   Earlier, committee members prayed for God's help to rise above
narrow self-interest and then began exempting individual
institutions from reform provisions of Bush's plan.
   The panel started what is expected to be at least two days of
work on the S&amp;L bill by exempting an institution in Gonzalez'
district from provisions that would make each bank or S&amp;L in a
holding company liable when another commonly controlled institution
fails.
   The amendment, passed by 37-11 vote, is designed to help only
the Frost National Bank of San Antonio.
   In a subsequent 44-2 vote, the panel adopted an amendment by
Reps. Elizabeth J. Patterson, D-S.C.; Thomas R. Carper, D-Del., and
Steve Bartlett, R-Texas, that carves out another exception for
Chemical Bank of New York and First Interstate Bancorp of Los
Angeles.
   By voice vote, lawmakers exempted two institutions in Nebraska
from the provision at the request of Rep. Peter Hoagland, D-Neb.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is seeking to broaden the
financial responsibility of holding companies in bank and S&amp;L
failures as a way of limiting losses to the government insurance
fund and to taxpayers.
   The 51-member committee had begun the session with bowed heads
as Walter Fauntroy, the District of Columbia's non-voting delegate
and a Baptist minister, prayed, ``Help each of us to rise above our
own narrow self-interest.''
   Fauntroy, a Democrat, said that in 19 years in Congress he had
never felt compelled to begin a committee session with prayer, but
was moved to offer one because of the extraordinary importance and
expense of the savings and loan legislation, described as the
biggest taxpayer bailout ever.
   Bush's bill, which passed the Senate last week, provides at
least $157 billion over 10 years, the bulk of it from taxpayers, to
pay for closing or merging more than 500 failed thrift institutions.
   It also contains a number of reforms designed to prevent the
problem from recurring, chief amog them a requirement that S&amp;L
owners back their lending with more of their own capital.
   Some of the committee members objecting to the exemption for the
bank in Gonzalez' district, including Annunzio and Rep. Mary Rose
Oakar, D-Ohio, are opposing the chairman's effort to stiffen
capital requirements as passed earlier this month by Annunzio's
Subcommittee on Financial Institutions.
   The subcommittee version would require S&amp;L owners to risk $1.50
in ``real money'' or ``tangible'' capital for every $100 in
lending, the same standard adopted by the Senate.
   Gonzalez, with an amendment that his opponents privately
conceded was likely to pass, would boost that to $2.25. He is
supported by Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the panel's senior
Republican.
   Annunzio argued that overly tough capital rules would force
hundreds of otherwise healthy institutions out of business.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, in a letter to Wylie,
repeated his threat to recommend that Bush veto any bill with weak
capital standards. Brady is seeking a 3 percent minimum for
tangible capital, but said Gonzalez's 2.25 percent standard ``shows
a marked and welcomed improvment.''
   In an attachment to his letter, Brady promised, ``Thrifts with
low capital and a reasonable chance of survival will not be
summarily liquidated.''
   However, he said they ``should not be allowed to grow and should
be under the supervision of the regulator.''
   On another matter, the committee voted 32-10 to adopt an
amendment by Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., aimed at prohibiting
banks from running advertisements disparaging the condition of the
S&amp;L deposit insurance funds. Backers argued that such ads
needlessly cause drains from S&amp;Ls since both banks and S&amp;Ls are
backed by the federal government. Opponents said the amendment
violated constitutional guarantees of free speech.

<HEAD>Wang Labs Accelerates Restructuring</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN COOPERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. said Wednesday it would
accelerate a planned restructuring, laying off employees faster and
cutting the pay of its top executives as it struggles to return to
profitability.
   The Lowell-based computer maker announced earlier this month
that it would trim its work force from 30,200 to 28,500 or less by
June 1990. The company said Wednesday it would reach that goal nine
months earlier, by Sept. 1989.
   The company also announced 20 percent pay cuts for An Wang, its
chairman and chief executive, and his son Frederick A. Wang, its
president and chief operating officer.
   Vice Chairman Harry H.S. Chou is also to take a 10 percent pay
cut, and all executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents
will take 5 percent cuts. The company said the reductions took
effect immediately and would be lifted when the company returns to
profitability.
   Wang reported last week that it had a $55 million pre-tax loss
in its third quarter, the second-largest ever, after a $78.6
million loss in December 1987.
   Founded in 1951, Wang ranks 145th on Fortune magazine's list of
the 500 largest American companies with revenues of $3.07 billion
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1988.
   After building its reputation on office word processors in the
1970s, the company faltered in recent years as sales of its
mid-range computer systems have been eaten away by powerful
personal computers and workstations.
   In addition, Wang has suffered from heavy discounting of its
mainstay VS line of minicomputers and competition from
International Business Machine Corp.'s AS400 minicomputer.
   In an effort to revive the company's fortunes, founder An Wang
has begun to take a more active role in day-to-day operations. The
company also has moved to cut costs and revise its product lines.
Over the last three months, it has cut its work force by 880,
mainly through attrition.
   Wang is now betting heavily on the success of its Freestyle
personal computing and imaging system, introduced in November,
which allows computer-shy office workers to alter electronic
documents with their voices and handwriting, as well as with a
keyboard.

<HEAD>Holly Farms Considers Leveraged Recapitalization</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holly Farms Corp. renewed its resistence
to a $1.15 billion takeover bid Wednesday and told shareholders an
overall refinancing of the company is being considered.
   Holly Farms has opposed a takeover by rival poultry processor
Tyson Foods Inc. since October. Holly shareholders voted last week
to reject a management-backed move to merge their company with
ConAgra Inc. of Omaha, Neb.
   In a statement announcing a quarterly dividend of 38 cents a
share, Holly managers said a ``leveraged recapitalization'' is
under consideration.
   Such a refinancing would involve mortgaging company assets to
pay dividends to stockholders, said Ted Bailey, a Holly Farms vice
president.
   ``It would just get some current value out to our shareholders.
It doesn't have anything to do with blocking Tyson,'' Bailey said.
   Bailey said he did not know how many company assets or which
ones might be mortgaged.
   Napoleon Overton, an analyst with Morgan Keegan &amp; Co. in
Memphis, said Holly Farms is in good financial shape and the
recapitalization could be a way to keep shareholders loyal to Holly
managers.
   ``Holly Farms management believes that a leveraged
recapitalization is now a viable alternative to either a merger
with ConAgra or an acquisition by Tyson Foods,'' Overton said.
   The recapitalization would greatly increase Holly Farms' debt,
he said. A debt increase often is used as a tool to fight off an
unwanted suitor.
   Jim Blair, general counsel for Tyson Foods of Springdale, Ark.,
said Holly managers should consider their shareholders' vote on the
ConAgra deal as a call to sell to Tyson.
   ``It looks to me a little like they're in the process again of
telling their shareholders what's best for them rather than
listening to their shareholders,'' Blair said.
   Tyson is offering Holly stockholders $63.50 a share in cash,
while the proposed merger with ConAgra was worth about $60 a share
in a stock swap.
   Holly Farms stock closed Wednesday at $60.75 a share, down 25
cents, in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading.

<HEAD>Davis Begins NWA Proxy Solicitation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: ADDS 3 grafs on Minnesota commerce commissioner's demand of
Davis.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil mogul Marvin Davis on Wednesday began his
proxy campaign to unseat the board of NWA Inc., mailing letters
seeking shareholder support for replacing the board with nominees
who would sell the airline company to Davis.
   ``We believe that a failure to elect our nominees will give the
NWA board an excuse to continue to pursue alternatives which do not
result in a prompt sale of the company,'' the letters read.
   NWA, parent of Eagan-based Northwest Airlines, has rejected
Davis' $90 a share tender offer valued at $2.7 billion but has
pledged to explore alternatives to maximize shareholder value.
   Davis, who owns about 2.8 percent of NWA's 29.1 million shares,
wrote in his letter that he is skeptical of the claim.
   He cited the company's refusal to withdraw its ``poison pill''
takeover defense plan and a requirement that Northwest suitors sign
a restrictive confidentiality agreement.
   ``Ask yourself whether NWA is truly seeking the best price for
you when they insist that we, the only announced bidder, sign an
agreement calling for us to consent to a standstill, abandon this
proxy contest, abandon our tender offer and abide by whatever
course or alternative the NWA board unilaterally approves,'' Davis
wrote.
   Northwest closed down 25 cents at $100 a share Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.
   Eleven board members are up for election at NWA's annual meeting
May 15.
   A group of dissident shareholders are attempting to change the
record date for the vote, which now is limited to shareholders of
record as of March 17.
   Hennepin County District Judge Delila Pierce said Wednesday that
the request deserves a hearing next week and denied a request by
NWA to refuse the change.
   Karl Cambronne, an attorney for the shareholders, said more than
65 percent of Northwest stock has changed hands since March 17.
Rivard said new owners of Northwest stock probably are takeover
speculators and would be more likely to vote for Davis' slate of
nominees.
   Lawyers for Northwest also asked Pierce to suspend the rest of
the Minnesota shareholders' lawsuit, saying jurisdiction in
shareholder matters belongs in the courts of Delaware, where
Northwest is incorporated.
   Pierce took that request under advisement without saying when
she would rule.
   NWA's poison pill would prevent Davis' proposed board from
selling the company for six months after getting control. A
Delaware judge on Tuesday denied Davis request to invalidate the
provision.
   Also Wednesday, Minnesota Commercer Commissioner Michael Hatch
said Davis must make supplemental disclosures to Minnesota
shareholders by 2 p.m. CDT Thursday to explain how he would operate
the airline in light of the large amount of money he proposes to
borrow to complete the purchase.
   If the ``objective facts'' are not supplied by the deadline, the
tender offer in Minnesota will be suspended, Hatch said. But the
commissioner also left open the possibility of another hearing on
the matter for Thursday night if Davis requests it.
   There was no immediate comment from Davis, said his spokeswoman,
Mary Conway.

<HEAD>Closure Of Terminal Curtails Britain's North Sea Gas Supplies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with officials now saying shutdown

<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7 percent of Britain's North Sea
gas supplies were halted following the shutdown Wednesday night of
the onshore St. Fergus gas terminal operated jointly by the Shell
and Esso oil companies, British Gas PLC said.
   The terminal near this east Scottish oil port city handles gas
from 16 production platforms in the British sector of the North Sea
oil and gas field.
   It was shut down after routine inspection revealed defects in
equipment that ``could be of a serious nature,'' Shell said.
   Shell initially reported that the shutdown involved the whole of
the terminal, which a spokesman for the Scottish sector of British
Gas PLC said handled about a third of Britain's North Sea gas
supplies. British Gas is the monopoly company responsible for gas
supplies to homes and industry throughout Britain.
   But a Shell spokesman subsequently said that only part of the
terminal had been shut and that this part accounted for about 7
percent of Britain's North Sea gas supplies.
   The shutdown is the second North Sea setback in eight days. The
North Sea's Brent oil field has been shut since April 18 when a gas
leak and explosion on Shell's Cormorant Alpha platform halted
production of 472,000 barrels of oil a day, or nearly a quarter of
the British sector's oil production.

   Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. said Tuesday it wants
to buy rival apparel maker Cluett Peabody &amp; Co., which is a
division of West Point-Pepperell Inc. of West Point, Ga.
   New York-based Phillips-Van Heusen said it is negotiating with
Farley Industries of Chicago, which recently bought West
Point-Pepperell, on a possible sale.
   ``We've been competitors of Cluett for 20 years, and we think we
can do lots for them to regain the aggressiveness they had before
they were bought by West Point-Pepperell,'' said Phillips-Van
Heusen President Bruce J. Klatsky.
   Officials of Farley Industries could not be reached for comment,
according to The New York Times.
   Each company has about 20 percent of the men's shirt market.
Cluett's chief brand is Arrow. Phillips-Van Heusen, which sells
under the Van Heusen label as well as others, also owns G.H. Bass &amp;
Co., the maker of Bass shoes.

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Rules Against Davis Effort To Void NWA Poison Pill</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS last graf with 5 new grafs to UPDATE with commerce commissioner
holding hearing, NWA board deferring plane order.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge on Tuesday denied oil
billionaire Marvin Davis' effort to void parts of a measure
designed to thwart a hostile takeover by Davis or other unwanted
suitors of Northwest Airlines' parent company.
   Chancellor William P. Allen of Delaware Chancery Court in
Wilmington rejected Davis' request for an injunction that would
have barred NWA Inc. from issuing ``poison pill'' stock rights to
shareholders before NWA's annual meeting May 15.
   A poison pill makes it more difficult and costly for a group to
take over a company.
   The stock-rights plan include a provision that bars any newly
elected NWA board from dropping the poison pill until 180 days
after the board is in place.
   Davis said the plan would put him at a competitive disadvantage
in his bid to take over the nation's fourth-largest air carrier
because it would effectively block a new board of directors from
selling Northwest for 180 days.
   Davis attorney Gilchrist Sparks argued Monday that the prospect
of a long delay would discourage shareholders from supporting Davis
in the proxy fight Davis planned at NWA's annual meeting.
   Davis' attorneys did not argue against the poison pill, saying
they would favor such a plan if Davis' group gained control of NWA.
But they challenged the 180-day umbrella.
   Allen wrote that he was ``rather unimpressed'' by Davis'
argument that the delay in canceling the poison pill ``will be a
material factor to those NWA shareholders who might otherwise (be)
for the Davis slate ... .''
   Allen ordered NWA to notify shareholders that his ruling is not
a final decision on the validity of the delayed redemption
provision, however. He said Davis may return 45 days after NWA's
annual meeting to seek a ruling on the plan's validity.
   In a statement, a Davis spokeman said: ``While we would, of
course, have preferred that the court grant the relief specifically
requested in our motion, we are most gratified that its is
requiring NWA, as a condition to the issuance of the rights, to
give stockholders notice that the provision may be invalidated and
that the court is committed to deciding the merits of the issue
soon after the annual meeting.''
   Tom Ryan, a Northwest spokesman, said he had just received the
ruling and could not comment on it in detail.
   ``It's fair to say we're pleased with it,'' he said.
   The NWA board of directors on Monday unanimously rejected Davis'
$2.7 billion, $90-a-share bid, alleging that the offer is
unfinanced and in part illegal under securities laws. But the board
said it is willing to negotiate with Davis and other qualified
bidders.
   NWA's stock closed at $100.50 Tuesday, down $2.25, on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   Minnesota Commerce Commissioner Michael Hatch has threatened to
suspend Davis Acquisition Inc.'s registration statement in which
Davis offers to purchase all of NWA's outstanding shares. Hatch
said Monday the statement is deficient in several areas.
   At a hearing Tuesday night, lawyers for Davis reacted coolly to
Hatch's request that they submit more information about Davis' bid.
   Los Angeles attorney George A. Vandeman said after the hearing
that he would try to convince Hatch that the disclosures already
made of Davis' financial plan are adequate.
   Hatch requested that more information be submitted by noon
Wednesday. If he decides that Davis has not made a sufficient
explanation of his plans, he can order that the offer be suspended
in the state.
   In a development Monday, the NWA board decided, at least
temporarily, against a planned $1.6 billion order for new planes.
Instead, it authorized its plane-leasing subsidiary to buy 10 used
DC-10s and 14 used DC-9s to lease to Northwest and other carriers.
