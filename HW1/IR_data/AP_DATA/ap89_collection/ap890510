<HEAD>Grand Jury Hearing Into Highway Killings Postponed Because of Funding
Cuts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Special grand jury hearings on the
slayings of nine women whose bodies were found by highways have
been postponed indefinitely because of state funding cuts,
officials said Wednesday.
   The Bristol County grand jury, which has been meeting off and on
for at least two months, will not reconvene until investigators get
enough evidence and serve subpoenas, said Jim Martin, a spokesman
for District Attorney Ronald Pina.
   That could take a long time because state troopers are no longer
authorized to work overtime, Martin said. Most subpoenas have been
served at night and on weekends because witnesses, primarily street
people, are hard to find, he said.
   The female victims were found along or near three highways near
this city close to Rhode Island since July.
   Troopers have run up thousands of overtime hours trying to track
leads, and investigators have gotten some of their best clues at
night, Martin said.
   The end of overtime puts the investigation ``further and further
behind,'' he said. ``Every day that we lose, we can't get back.''
   Another Bristol County Superior Court Grand Jury on Wednesday
indicted Anthony R. DeGrazia on 13 rape and assault charges.
   DeGrazia was arraigned in district court last week after a
witness who appeared before the special grand jury said she had
identified his photo.
   Martin said the indictment had nothing to do with the killings,
and refused to comment on whether DeGrazia had been linked to the
investigation.
   The state Senate has enacted a $17.4 million deficiency budget,
but the Legislature did not approve $2.1 million in emergency
overtime pay for troopers through the end of the fiscal year June
30.

   The woman called the ``godmother'' of a
drug-smuggling cult that killed 15 people was charged Wednesday
night with two other members in the weekend deaths of their leader
and his right-hand man, authorities said.
   ``Godmother'' Sara Aldrete Villarreal, 24; Omar Francisco Orea,
23, and Alvaro de Leon Valdez, 22, were formally charged in the
Saturday shootings, reported Marco Antonio Diaz de Leon, director
of judicial proceedings for the Mexico City attorney general's
office.
   Earlier Wednesday, a source in his office said Ms. Aldrete has a
split personality and U.S. Customs Agent Oran Neck told a news
conference that Ms. Aldrete ``confessed to conspiracy and
involvement'' in ritual killings.
   She and the other two also were charged Wednesday with criminal
association, resisting arrest, shooting a firearm at authorities
and for injuries incurred in the Saturday gunbattle with police.
   Cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and his chief
lieutenant, Martin Quintana Rodriguez, were killed in a Mexico City
apartment during a shootout with police. Constanzo, a Cuban-born
American from Florida, reportedly instructed de Leon Valdez to kill
him and Quintana as police moved in.
   The cult believed that ritual killings would give them occult
protection in their drug-running.
   The three charged with homicide, along with two other Mexico
City women, still have not been arraigned, Diaz de Leon said. An
arraignment date was not announced.
   Diaz de Leon said two other Mexico City women arrested Saturday,
Dr. Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez, 23, a physician, and Maria del
Rocio Cuevas Guerra, 43, were charged with cover-up _ a federal
crime _ in the ritual deaths at the border city of Matamoros,
Mexico, across from Brownsville, Texas.
   Aldrete, a Mexican who attended college in Texas; Orea, and De
Leon Valdez were charged only in crimes said to have taken place
within the jurisdiction of Mexico City. They have not been charged
with the 15 ritual slayings near Matamoros.
   Ms. Aldrete and Orea were charged in the deaths of Constanzo and
Quintana ``because they had agreed and made a pact before the
deaths in case they were going to be arrested,'' Diaz de Leon said.
``This death pact was carried out.''
   Also on Wednesday, Orea; suspected cult members Salvador Antonio
Gutierrez Juarez, arrested in the capital on Tuesday, and Juan
Carlos Fragoso, arrested Wednesday, were charged in the July 1988
killing of Ramon Baez, a transvestite who was killed in a Mexico
City suburb.
   Authorities earlier said Gutierrez, also known as Jorge Montes,
confessed to participating along with Constanzo in Baez's slaying.
Ms. Aldrete was charged with cover-up in the Baez killing.
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete were wanted on both sides of the
border since April 11 when Mexican police, acting on a tip, dug up
15 mutilated bodies at a desolate ranch near Matamoros.
   One body was identified as that of Mark Kilroy, 21, a pre-med
student from Santa Fe, Texas.
   U.S. authorities said Wednesday that Ms. Aldrete admitted to
involvement in some of the earlier ritual slayings.
   Diaz de Leon would not comment on any confession, saying only
that Ms. Aldrete ``most certainly is immersed in these crimes.''
   The source at the Mexico City attorney general's office,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Ms. Aldrete loses that
``charming aspect'' she exhibits when she faces television cameras
and seems to revert to another self when talking to police about
cult rituals.
   ``I would say she has three personalities,'' he said.
   One personality comes out when she faces the cameras and denies
any involvement in the human slayings, another emerges when she
talks to police and ``the third one comes out when she talks to
herself,'' the source said.
   U.S. agent Neck returned to Brownsville on Wednesday from a
72-hour trip to Mexico City. He and a Cameron County investigator,
Lt. George Gavito, assisted Mexican authorities in the closing
stages of the case.
   Neck told reporters, ``Sara has kind of lost touch with reality.
No question about it. Her dual personality is coming up pretty
strong right now. When you talk to her without the TV cameras
there, she's pretty truthful.''
   ``She's giving a lot of data with great detail to investigators
working this case right now. It seems like when the cameras come
on, she kind of reverts back to this nice, young, clean-cut kid
from Texas Southmost College,'' Neck said
   ``When the cameras were there, she was real nice. When she was
with us she was the same ol' witch,'' Gavito said.

<HEAD>Area Where Sinatra And Liddy Roamed To Turn Into Office Space?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The city where tough guys Frank Sinatra and
G. Gordon Liddy grew up has voted to replace the gritty docks
featured in the movie ``On the Waterfront'' with condominiums and
offices.
   By a nearly 2-1 margin Tuesday, voters in the one square-mile
city rejected a referendum that would have converted the 31-acre
Hudson River waterfront tract into a park with a tremendous view of
the Manhattan skyline.
   ``The vote shows the concern of the city about being rational in
the proportion of parklands,'' said Councilman Steve Cappiello, one
of the leaders against the referendum. ``I think the area is
located so that it would not have too much impact on the city of
Hoboken.''
   Cappello said Wednesday that city leaders want to convert the
prime waterfront space into office and residential space.
   The issue highlights the friction caused by the rapid
gentrification the Hudson County community is undergoing. Newer and
younger residents, many of whom fled Manhattan for lower rents,
sought the park. Older residents want the tax revenues that new
development might bring to the city.

   A City Council candidate says he regrets
throwing water into an opponent's face at a public forum after she
called him a wife beater.
   ``It's something that on sober reflection I shouldn't have
done,'' Frank Little said Wednesday.
   ``Under the circumstance, she's lucky that's all I did.''
   The scuffle between Little and candidate Helen Hull occurred
Tuesday at Homewood Carnegie Library.
   After the water was thrown, Hull slapped Little as the two
tangled briefly on the stage, witnesses said. Hull said Little
tried to strike her.
   At that point, witnesses said, spectators rushed the stage and
subdued Little while Hull's supporters led her away.
   Hull, who was executive director of a shelter for battered women
from 1981 to 1983, said she does not remember striking Little.
   ``If I did, he deserved it,'' said Hull.
   The candidates are running in Tuesday's Democratic primary.

   The scales of justice took on a
whole new meaning when a man decided to try and prevent a Detroit
suburb from making him move 16 boa constrictors and pythons out of
his one-bedroom apartment.
   Eric Larson, 26, who owns the snakes, has sued Sterling Heights
to prevent its enforcement of an ordinance that makes it illegal to
keep ``an animal not commonly kept or housed as a household pet,''
said Lori Finazzo, an assistant city attorney.
   Two of Larson's pets _ Colah, a 10-foot, 50-pound anaconda, and
Beauregard, a 2-foot, Bolivian, red-tailed boa constrictor _ were
entered Monday as evidence by defense attorney Charles Langton.
   Larson lifted Colah from its cage and wrapped the snake around
his neck while explaining to Macomb County Circuit Judge Raymond
Cashen that he lets eight of his larger snakes slither freely
around his apartment. The eight smaller snakes are kept in cages in
the bedroom, while Larson sleeps in the living room, he said.
   The prosecution is arguring that the snakes could escape through
plumbing and make their way to other apartments,
   ``Anacondas are aquatic,'' Finazzo said. ``They'll go straight
for the toilet.''

   Some sports fans are getting a chance to
show their stuff on the evening sportscast. But if they're not a
hit with viewers, they may be hit with a gong.
   Ten people, including Billy Martin Jr., son of the former
Yankees manager, are getting their shot on KAMC-TV.
   The ABC affiliate has uirged viewers to call in and rate the
performances.
   Those who flunk get to watch KAMC-TV news director Larry Elliott
pull out his mallet and strike the gong ending their brief
broadcasting careers.
   After the station's sports director left last month, Elliott
announced on the air that he was accepting applications from any
resident with guts enough to appear on the 6 p.m. newscast and read
the sports news.
   ``You always figure there's someone out there that could do it
but doesn't think they could or hasn't had the opportunity,'' said
Elliott, a former welder who believes ordinary people can present
news as well as professionals.
   The contest ends Friday.
   Elliott concedes he may end up hiring a professional, but before
he does he plans to broadcast some of the audition videotapes he's
gotten.
   The professionals will face a call-in vote _ and the gong _ just
like the amateurs, Elliott said.

   The deaths of six riot troopers in
South Korea's latest wave of protests could bring a lull to the
country's turbulent politics, but there seems little chance of
lasting peace.
   South Koreans were shocked by the killings of the officers, set
on fire by radical students May 3, and angrily demanded an end to
demonstrations. Government and opposition leaders all say the
protests have gone too far and the violence must end.
   Some radical students have promised to stop violent
demonstrations and using firebombs. Several dissident groups
apologized to police for the deaths, and many observers predict a
lull in protests.
   At the same time, most political leaders and other observers
agree the basic causes of unrest have not changed and the struggle
between the government and its opponents is far from over.
   South Korea must overcome many problems to achieve stability,
including ending a legacy of authoritarian rule, bitter rivalry
between political parties and the impact of rapid economic and
social change. Violent demonstrations are a symptom of these larger
problems.
   Since violence is the radicals' most effective tool, it seems
unlikely they will renounce it for long, especially if the
government continues to crush dissent. Violence has been a part of
Korean politics and life for many years, and there is little chance
of it disappearing overnight.
   Government statistics show there were 1,512 major protests in
the first four months of this year, in which students used more
than 300,000 firebombs and injured 3,800 police officers.
   Korean politics are dominated by an acrimonious power struggle.
Opposition parties have not accepted the government of Roh Tae-woo
and constantly try to weaken or discredit it.
   Roh, a former general who narrowly won 1987 presidential
elections after rival candidates split the opposition vote, insists
he is committed to bringing full democracy. But critics on the left
and the right charge Roh is indecisive and is not overcoming many
of the problems.
   Bitter feuding between the government and opposition has
produced constant political confusion and unrest. The opposition
parties' drive against the government has been blunted only by
chronic feuding and attempts to wreck each other.
   Opposition leaders are targets of growing public criticism for
pursuing their own ambitions for power and failing to help build
stability. Many Koreans say they are tired of politics, but the
regional loyalties and factionalism on which politics are based
help keep squabbling politicians in power.
   South Korea still is dominated by a traditional ruling elite
drawn from the military, government bureaucracy and industrialists,
despite democratic reforms since the authoritarian regime of Chun
Doo-hwan was forced out after massive riots in 1987.
   Some political observers and opposition leaders say real
democracy won't be possible until the control of the elite is
ended. The opposition says the establishment will try to block
democracy if its hold on power is threatened.
   The deepest changes in South Korea may come from rapid
industrialization and Westernizing of this once poor, backward
society. South Korea's meteoric rise as an industrial power has
been accompanied by the growing sophistication of many of its
people, who expect to run their country and share in its new wealth.
   Professionals, skilled workers and others who produce the cars,
ships and other goods that have made South Korea an economic force
are not willing to accept unresponsive governments that try to
order people around.
   A wave of labor strikes in recent months has been inspired by
demands for better pay and an end to the long hours and poor
working conditions many Koreans endure for little better than
subsistence wages.
   Radical students and dissidents contend the Roh government is a
front for military rule. Dissident leaders call for the overthrow
of the government and creation of an ill-defined government of the
masses.
   The government says the radicals are leftist revolutionaries
trying to destroy democracy. But the radicals have virtually no
public support because of their extreme views and violent tactics.
They are no major threat to the government.
   Radical leaders say time is on their side because industrial
workers eveutally will join them and fight for their utopian dream.
But most observers say the workers want a share of Korea's wealth
and a democratic government controlled by the people.
   The problem is overcoming the many obstacles that stand in the
way.

   Millionaire businessman P.J. Morgan was
elected mayor Tuesday, ending a political comeback bid by former
Mayor Mike Boyle.
   With only absentee ballots remaining to be counted, Morgan had
56,774 votes, or 53.35 percent, to 48,115 votes, or 45.21 percent,
for Boyle in the non-partisan race.
   Boyle, who was recalled from his second term as mayor two years
ago amid allegations he abused his executive power, said during the
campaign that he was a changed man.
   In his concession speech, he echoed his campaign theme of Omaha
as a ``family town,'' and urged supporters to work with Morgan to
solve the city's problems.
   ``We pull together after we fight,'' Boyle said.
   Morgan, a real estate manager, said in his acceptance speech,
that it was time for the city to move forward and meet the
challenges of fighting drugs and improving Omaha's economic base.
   ``I'm ready to turn the dream of a better Omaha into reality,''
Morgan said.
   During the campaign, Morgan outspent Boyle by a margin of nearly
2-to-1.
   But he said Tuesday night that he didn't believe money made the
difference in the race.
   ``I think this: since April 4, the spending has been pretty
close,'' Morgan said. ``We spent more in the primary, but it's been
pretty close since then.''
   Boyle said money was a factor.
   ``We were outspent pretty substantially; yet, I think we were
doing really well,'' he said before making his concession.
   Morgan said he believed the endorsements of Mayor Walt Calinger
and City Councilman Fred Conley played a part in his victory.
   ``We focused on the issues,'' he said. ``The people of the
community accepted our message, our vision of the future.''
   Douglas County Election Commissioner Vickie Edwards Florine had
predicted a 60 percent turnout. The April 4 primary with seven
mayoral candidates had record turnout of nearly 100,000 registered
voters in the city of 340,000 people.
   Boyle, 45, contended the recall was prompted by his
controversial management style, something he says has changed. He
said during the campaign that he's a recovering alcoholic and
hasn't had a drink in more than a year.
   The effort that led to Boyle's ouster by a vote of 55,275 to
42,832 was led by the group Citizens for Mature Leadership, which
re-emerged in an effort to keep him out of office.
   Morgan, 49, is a member of the Omaha Airport Authority, was a
Douglas County commissioner in the 1970s and a state senator from
1971-72. He said his business experience could benefit the city.
   Street gangs, drugs and economic development in this Missouri
River city were the main campaign issues.
   The city has had three mayors since 1985. The City Council chose
council member Bernie Simon to succeed Boyle in 1987. Council
member Walt Calinger became mayor after Simon's death in April
1988, but lost his bid to retain the job in last month's primary.

<TEXT>
   A zoologist frustrated by
a lack of live animal specimens has found a unique path to
scientific discovery _ the Everglades roads.
   Eric Juterbock scours roads in the park every night for
flattened frogs, splattered snakes and other wildlife that couldn't
make it in the fast lane.
   Juterbock, an assistant professor on sabbatical from the
University of Ohio at Lima, says he turned to the roads after
failing to find enough specimens of salamanders for a study.
   ``I just got tired of working on things that you can't find many
of,'' he said recently.
   His new search for what sanitation workers call ``road pizza''
is proving more successful. The 41-year-old scientist has found as
many as 358 dead frogs on a one-mile stretch of highway.
   Many specimens are too squashed to be of use, but others are
almost intact. Juterbock keeps a cooler with his better finds,
including coiled, jewel-colored snakes and a frog crouched in an
action pose.
   ``This one got its head squashed, but the rest is in pretty good
shape,'' he said, unwrapping a frozen garter snake at his research
residence in the park.
   Juterbock will stop for living creatures, too.
   He stopped his van one night when his sharp eyes spotted a
shining green object. He found a pair of mating walking sticks,
insects he says are in almost permanent copulation during the
mating season.
   One object of his research is to discover whether animals breed
more actively to compensate for the roadside slaughter.

   NBC has tied CBS' 26-year record of 46 weeks at
the top of the A.C. Nielsen Co. television ratings, and says it
expects to keep the streak going at least until the National
Basketball Association finals.
   ``The next hurdle is when CBS has two games of the NBA finals,''
said Gerald Jaffe, NBC vice president for research projects.
   ``If we hurdle that, and I'm not saying we will, I can't see
anything (to stop NBC) until next season.''
   The NBA finals broke NBC's streak last June before it started
building to the 46-week mark. The streak was almost broken in
February when CBS, aided by ``Lonesome Dove,'' tied one week with
NBC.
   NBC won last week with an average, prime-time rating of 13.7 to
CBS' 12.4. and ABC's 11.7.
   ABC's seemingly never-ending miniseries ``War and Remembrance''
began anew with the final 11{ hours, but viewers weren't very
impressed. The first installment of the final five chapters in the
39{-hour sequel to ``The Winds of War'' began Sunday with a 13.4
rating and 21 share. NBC won the movie battle Sunday with
``Witness,'' which ranked 10th.
   Each rating point equals 904,000 households with television. The
share is a percentage of sets in use.
   NBC's Saturday-night hit ``Hunter'' finished in seventh place
and had its highest rating since July.
   Tuesday's conclusion of CBS' two-part ``Guts &amp; Glory: The Rise
and Fall of Oliver North'' didn't stir viewers and ranked 58th.
   The top 10 shows of the week were: ``Roseanne'' ABC, ``The Cosby
Show'' NBC, ``Cheers'' NBC, ``A Different World'' NBC, ``60
Minutes'' CBS, ``Golden Girls'' NBC, ``Hunter'' NBC, ``The Wonder
Years'' ABC, ``Empty Next'' NBC, and ``Witness'' NBC.
   The 10 lowest-rated network shows were: ``Tour of Duty,'' ``Hard
Time on Planet Earth,'' ``Disney's Totally Minnie,'' ``Dream
Street,'' ``A Man Called Hawk,'' ``American Kids: Teaching Them How
to Think,'' ``Jim Henson,'' ``Over the Edge,'' ``SST: Stage, Screen
and Television'' and ``Three of a Kind.''
   ``ABC World News Tonight'' reclaimed the lead in the news race
with a 10.0 rating and 21 share. The ``CBS Evening News'' had a 9.8
and 20. ``NBC Nightly News'' had a 9.2 and 20 share.

Thursday, will bow to mainstream entertainment and glamour with a
selection of films by established directors and more international
stars than last year.
   The often long, austere films competing for last year's Golden
Palm, the festival's coveted award for best film, have been
replaced by what some might see as surer box-office draws.
   West German director Wim Wenders will preside over this year's
jury as it chooses among the 22 films from 14 countries in the
official competition.
   Setting the tone are two American movies opening and closing the
two-week festival: ``New York Stories,'' a trilogy by Francis Ford
Coppola, Martin Scorsese and Woody Allen, and ``Old Gringo,''
starring Jane Fonda and Gregory Peck.
   The rehabilitated version of David Lean's desert saga,
``Lawrence of Arabia,'' which includes segments left out of the
movie first seen 27 years ago, provides a special ``pre-opening''
to the festival Wednesday night.
   Festival Director Gilles Jacob said this year's selection is
``more a diversion than last year's'' and ``laughter is not
forbidden.''
   Indeed, the festival will open with a special hommage to Charlie
Chaplin, who would have been 100 years old this year.
   The United States is making a strong showing at this year's
festival. Two of its other films in the competition are ``Mystery
Train'' by Jim Jarmusch and Hugh Hundson's ``Lost Angels'' about
gangs of teenagers in Los Angeles.
   Italy, absent last year, has four movies competing, including
Ettore Scola's ``Splendor'' with Marcelo Mastroianni.
   Among the most discussed movies is Australian director Fred
Schepisi's ``A Cry in the Dark,'' the true story of a woman, played
by Meryl Streep, falsely accused of murdering her infant who was
snatched away by a wild dingo.
   Ms. Streep is among the stars scheduled to appear in Cannes,
along with Fonda, Peck, Mastroianni, Gerard Depardieu and Omar
Sharif.
   Depardieu stars in Bertrand Blier's ``Trop Belle Pour Toi'' (Too
Beautiful for You), one of three French entries, a story of a
garage mechanic, played by Depardieu, who finds his wife too
beautiful and falls in love with another woman.
   Also in the competition are several directors showing their
first films, including the American Steven Soderbergh with ``Sex,
Lies and Videotapes,'' Swede Carl Gustav Nykvist's ``Kvinnorna Pa
Taket'' (Women on the Roof) and Australian Jane Campion's
``Sweetie.''
   East bloc countries are notably absent from this year's
competition with the exception of Yugoslavia, represented by Emir
Kusturica's ``Domza Vesanje'' (The Time of the Gypsies).
   Japan is present with ``Kuroi Ame'' (Black Rain), directed by
Shohei Imamura, a one-time winner of the Golden Palm for his
``Ballad of Narayama.''
   While just 22 movies are competing for the Golden Palm, more
than 1,500 will be shown before the festival closes on May 23.
   Last year's festival gave the Golden Palm to ``Pelle the
Conqueror,'' a film by Danish director Bille August.

   Will the real Sen. Christopher J. Dodd please
stand up?
   The Connecticut Democrat was identified as a ``bachelor party
animal'' by Newsweek in a feature last week called ``Faces on the
Capitol Campus.''
   But The Washingtonian magazine hinted the 44-year-old divorced
senator may be trying to live down his high-profile life on the
social scene.
   ``Senator Chris Dodd ... may be settling down with a nice Mormon
woman. He's even met her folks back in Utah,'' the magazine
reported.
   ``He has been steady of habits more than a bachelor party animal
if he ever was one,'' his spokesman Jason Isaacson said.
   ``There's too much depending on him, especially since he's
getting older and taking on more responsibility,'' Isaacson said.
   The Washingtonian report was ``closer to reality'' than
Newsweek, Isaacson said, but he declined to discuss the reports
about the woman.

   Rock 'n' roll legend Fats Domino has canceled
a weekend appearance reportedly because of problems with high blood
pressure.
   ``His doctor said he can't perform,'' said Brian Lawson, a
spokesman for Bally's Reno hotel-casino.
   Domino, 61, was scheduled to perform in five shows with Chubby
Checker.
   ``Chubby's only half of the show we promised, so we're canceling
the whole thing,'' Lawson said Tuesday.
   Domino performed Sunday at the closing of the New Orleans Jazz
Festival with no visible problems, rousing the audience with his
trademark ending in which he plays the piano so hard it moves
across the stage in time with the beat.

   An armed robbery charge has been dropped
against ``Diff'rent Strokes'' star Todd Bridges.
   Bridges' preliminary hearing was about to begin Tuesday when
Deputy District Attorney Robert Gosney moved to dismiss the charge.
   ``Some new information came in that cast a serious doubt (on)
whether we had the right man,'' Gosney said.
   He declined to describe the information, and said the charge may
be refiled against the 23-year-old Bridges if the new evidence
fails to stand.
   Investigators had said Bridges took his BMW from a repair shop
at gunpoint Jan. 23 instead of paying a $500 repair bill.
   Bridges still faces an attempted murder charge for a Feb. 2
shooting that stemmed from a dispute over the car, authorities said.
   Bridges for eight years played the character Willis Jackson on
``Diff'rent Strokes'' opposite co-stars Gary Coleman and Conrad
Bain.

   A professional wrestler known for pulling
out a snake and letting it crawl over his opponents has been
arrested on charges that he punched a man during an argument over
women.
   Jake ``The Snake'' Roberts was arrested Monday night at the
World Wrestling Federation Big Double Main Event at the Orlando
Arena.
   Police officers watched Roberts beat up Ted ``The Million-Dollar
Man'' DiBiase, and then arrested the 6-foot-5, 249-pound Roberts on
charges that he punched a 5-foot-7 Daytona Beach man last December.
   Roberts, 43, was booked on an outstanding Volusia County warrant
charging him with aggravated battery. He was released about an hour
later on $2,500 bond.
   A circuit judge signed an arrest warrant after John Bartlett,
27, of Daytona Beach, said the wrestler punched him in the face and
abdomen following a night on the town.
   Bartlett told authorities that he was only defending his town
and its women against Roberts' insulting remarks when he found
himself on the receiving end of the punches.
   ``The Snake,'' whose real name is Aurelian Smith Jr., is cast as
a wrestling ``good guy.''
   After applying a wrestling maneuver, Roberts then pulls his
8-foot snake out of a burlap bag and lets it crawl over his victims.

   Domino's Pizza owner Tom Monaghan is
opening his pizzerias in Michigan to runaways in a program he hopes
will help troubled youngsters.
   ``I really didn't have a home to run away from. It was certainly
a period when I floundered a lot,'' said Monaghan, an orphan.
   ``Just a few key pivotal points in my life could have gone one
way or the other and I believe this is probably a very pivotal
point in these kids' lives when they walk into a safe place and get
some professional attention.''
   Monaghan announced Project Safe Place on Tuesday.
   Under the guidelines, youngsters will be able to walk into any
of the 195 Domino's stores displaying a Project Safe Place sign and
ask for help. A store employee then will put the youngster in touch
with a shelter or the statewide toll-free hotline for runaways.

<HEAD>Study Says Consortium Not Sole Key To US Semiconductor Competitiveness</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A government study suggests a host of tax,
trade and antitrust issues will dictate the global competitiveness
of the U.S. semiconductor industry regardless of a Texas research
consortium's success in chip manufacturing research.
   The Commerce Department study said Sematech's performance is no
guarantee the United States will capture the competitive edge in
the semiconductor industry.
   Sematech, a jointly funded partnership between the Pentagon and
14 semiconductor manufacturers, was created last year in an effort
to help the U.S. achieve global leadership in such technology by
1993.
   The Austin, Texas, consortium was launched because of fears a
decline in the U.S. semiconductor industry may undermine the
competitive and technological leadership of U.S. computer and
communications equipment makers. A growing U.S. dependence on
foreign sources for state-of-the-art weapons components also is a
concern, the report said.
   The study, a report by the Advisory Council on Federal
Participation in Sematech, recommends the Pentagon spend $100
million on Sematech in fiscal 1990, to be matched by the member
corporations. Withdrawal of federal support now ``would seriously
limit Sematech's operations and prospects for success,'' it said.
   But the recently released study cautioned that even if Sematech
``were a complete success in its own terms, major issues now
affecting the competitiveness of U.S. chipmakers would remain _
limited marketing opportunities and a range of tax, antitrust and
trade policy issues.''
   The U.S. would still trail the Japanese and Europeans in
developing technology needed for competitive leadership in
semiconductors in the late 1990s, particularly in the area of X-ray
lithography, the report said.
   ``If the public investment in Sematech is not followed by an
increase in the competitive strength of U.S. chipmakers and their
suppliers, Sematech as a public policy will not have been
successful,'' the study said.
   Even as Sematech was gaining momentum in 1988, U.S.
semiconducter manufacturers continued to lose ground commercially
as their share of world market sales fell to 37 percent, three
percentage points below the 1987 level, the study said.
   Efforts by other countries to create alliances of business,
government and academia ``have the potential to weaken the United
States economically and militarily. ... Observers have suggested
that the Sematech model _ federally sponsored pre-competitive
industry cooperation _ may be one answer to this problem,'' the
report said.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's proposal for
elections in the occupied lands is edging toward the dustbin of
Middle East peace plans, opposed both by members of his
conservative Likud bloc and by the Palestinians.
   Ariel Sharon, who heads Likud's far-right faction, was reported
Tuesday to be planning a challenge within the party in hopes of
sinking the plan. He called it Israel's ``biggest ever national
blunder.''
   Shamir, in an interview Tuesday, appeared to dash any hopes held
by moderate Palestinians that elections might be a first step to
their dream of an independent state.
   He told The Jerusalem Post he wanted those moderates to reject
the idea of an independent nation even before the election.
   He said his proposal for limited autonomy, with Palestinians
running their own affairs while Israel maintains control of
security, was the best he could offer.
   His plan calls for elected Palestinians from the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip to negotiate an interim peace with Israel to be
followed by talks on the final status of the territories.
   The approach has been rejected by the Palestine Liberation
Organization and a group of influential leaders in the occupied
lands but Shamir has said he does not see the rejection as final.
   In Tuesday's interview, Shamir said he believed elections could
still go forward. One government official said Israel hopes
Secretary of State James A. Baker III can convince the Soviet Union
during his visit to Moscow this week to join Washington in trying
to persuade the PLO to accept the plan.
   Shamir's statement on prior rejection by Palestinians of an
independent state may have been aimed at deflecting right-wing
criticism. But Palestinian leaders said they knew of no politician
in the occupied lands willing to run with that condition.
   ``I can't imagine any Palestinian who would take part in any
political activity in which he has to veto a Palestinian state,''
said Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian journalist.
   Even Mayor Elias Freij of Bethlehem, who in the past favored
elections and was threatened by the PLO for his stand, criticized
Shamir's latest suggestion.
   ``Shamir's statement that Palestinians must turn down a state
makes the elections meaningless, void of any content,'' Freij told
The Associated Press.
   Shamir, in the interview, said elections could come about if
Israel could convince Palestinians that hopes for a state were
``illusions,'' and their 17-month uprising in the occupied
territories can be broken by Israel.
   Kuttab, however, said the Palestinians would not end the
uprising _ in which 466 Palestinians and 21 Israelis have been
killed _ without some gains for their losses.
   ``Palestinians are willing to stop the intefadeh,'' he said,
using the Arabic word for uprising, ``but for what? Stop the
intefadeh and go back to where we were in December 1987, no way.''
   Kuttab told the AP that Palestinians want a signal from Shamir
that Israel is ready to compromise and give up at least part of the
West Bank and Gaza in exchange for peace _ the formula favored by
the United States.
   ``We want him (Shamir) to recognize that we are occupied, that
this land is not forever Israel, that it's up for negotiations,''
he said.
   A government official, who briefed reporters on the election
plan, said Israel's coalition government was too divided to make
any formal declaration on the final status of the territories,
which Israel seized in 1967.
   Finance Minister Shimon Peres and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, leaders of the center-left Labor Party that shares power
with Shamir's Likud, favor trading territory for peace, though not
the creation of a Palestinian state.
   Shamir and his Likud protege, Foreign Minister Moshe Arens,
oppose giving up any land.
   But Shamir's biggest problem may be with his own colleagues and
not with the Labor Party.
   Industry Minister Sharon, who has failed in past challenges for
Likud's leadership, has repeatedly denounced Shamir's plan.
   In an interview on army radio Tuesday, Sharon called the
elections proposal ``a calamity for Israel, representing the
biggest ever national blunder that will lead to the creation of a
Palestinian state.''
   Israel radio reported that Sharon planned to try to kill the
plan by taking it before Likud's Central Committee, which he heads.
   The Jerusalem Post quoted a leading Likud member, Planning
Minister Yitzhak Modai, as saying the plan as it now stands ``will
be rejected out of hand'' by the committee.

<HEAD>US Welcomes Evidence that Panamanians Finally Rebuffing Noriega</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After long periods in which the only
significant opposition to Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega seemed to
come from the U.S. government, American officials are encouraged by
the throngs of anti-Noriega demonstrators in Panama the past few
days.
   When Noriega dumped independent-minded Panamanian presidents in
1985 and 1988, the streets of Panama City were quiet. Nary a voice
was raised in protest even though both presidents could claim at
least a modicum of democratic legitimacy.
   There was concern here that an attempt by Noriega to steal last
Sunday's election would be greeted with apathy once again by a
people who often do not expect much from their political leaders.
   But the streets of Panama City have been alive with protest over
the past few days, suggesting that Noriega could be weaker now than
he has been at any time since becoming Defense Forces commander
almost six years ago.
   The Bush administration strategy has been clear. Early on,
officials saw the election as a major opportunity for political
change even though there was little reason to believe that Noriega
would tolerate an honest process.
   The administration reasoned that the Panamanian opposition
needed a catalyst around which it could rally, and the election
provided it. U.S. officials had predicted that Noriega would
respond in one of two ways to evidence of broad-based opposition:
He would either cancel the elections or try to rig the outcome.
   Either way he would be weakened politically, a high-priority
U.S. objective. Noriega decided to go ahead with the election,
thinking all along he would be able to manipulate the results, a
time-honored practice in Panama, according to many who claim to
have seen it firsthand.
   If there were protests, Noriega believed he could ride them out.
After all, he may have felt, with some reason, invulnerable to
pressure. He was able to survive street protests two years ago
after a one-time ally turned against him. He was also emboldened by
his ability to withstand U.S. economic and political pressures. In
addition, Noriega was able to reduce to irrelevance Panamanian
leaders who dared challenge his authority.
   In 1985, President Nicolas Ardito Barletta was ousted with
lightning swiftness after calling for an investigation into the
death of a Noriega critic who witnesses said was killed by
Noriega's agents.
   Fourteen months ago, after President Eric Arturo Delvalle tried
to fire Noriega, it took Noriega's allies in the National Assembly
precisely 10 minutes to remove Delvalle from office.
   Noriega also was able to shrug off U.S. criminal indictments
stemming from his alleged involvement in drug smuggling. An attempt
by dissident officers to oust Noriega a year ago was put down
within hours.
   But now Noriega appears on the defensive, the election seeming
to demonstrate that his base of support is perilously thin. The
Bush administration is now attempting to devise a strategy that
will push him over the edge and thus restore a degree of normality
to the U.S.-Panamanian relationship for the first time in years.
   When the election campaign began several months ago, prospects
for Noreiga's opponents seemed dim but not hopeless. They felt
reassured by the expressions of support and encouragement from
delegations of human rights activists from the United States and
elsewhere interested in a democratic outcome in Panama.
   The opposition also may have been given a shot in the arm from
the $10 million it received, according to reports, in clandestine
aid from the U.S. government. It also has been galvanized by the
steep economic decline Panama has suffered under Noriega's rule.
   Now the administration is groping for new ways to make Noriega
wonder whether he would be better off elsewhere. The Reagan
administration thought for sure Noriega was on his way out well
over a year ago and it miscalculated badly. The Bush administration
is hoping that it is Noriega who has miscalculated this time.

   A woman sued the man she planned to
marry because his former live-in girlfriend showed up univited for
the wedding _ which was then canceled, according to news reports
today.
   The Korea Herald said a 26-year-old woman identified only as
Shin was seeking $21,000 in damages for mental stress and repayment
of wedding costs from Pak Chang-su, 32, her intended groom.
   The suit, filed in district court in the southeastern port of
Pusan, said the wedding was canceled after a woman who had lived
with Pak for seven years showed up unexpectedly at the wedding hall.

   Three men were sentenced to prison terms
of up to three years for firebombing an anti-Fascist memorial in
the southern city of Graz.
   The memorial, by German-American sculptor Hans Haacke, was part
of an exhibit and arts festival devoted to the country's past
half-century.
   Austria had been incorporated into Adolf Hitler's Third Reich
and Graz was a Nazi stronghold in 1938.
   The monument, a wooden obelisk commemorating Jews, gypsies and
others killed by the Nazis, was firebombed on Nov. 2 and severely
damaged.
   On Tuesday, a Graz court sentenced Peter Lukas, 37, to three
years in jail for carrying out the attack. Hubert Steinbrugger, 68,
was sentenced to 18 months and Arne Mayer, 24, to one year, both as
accomplices.
   The men also were found guilty of Nazi-like activity and fined
$77,000, the cost of the damage to the monument.
   Steinbrugger was sentenced in 1954 to a 15-month jail term for
neo-Nazi activity, according to the Austria Press Agency.

   The electoral fraud that shocked
former President Jimmy Carter was hardly a surprise in a nation
where voting has seldom determined who holds power.
   Panama was a province of Colombia in 1903, when the United
States helped Gen. Esteban Huertas mount a successful revolt
because President Theodore Roosevelt wanted to build a canal.
   Panama declared its independence on Nov. 3 that year.
   ``I took the Isthmus,'' crowed Roosevelt as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers went to work to cut a path through the narrow waist
between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.
   Democracy has had a rough ride ever since.
   By 1940, the country had had 21 leaders in 37 years, including
four in 1918. And in the last 21 years, Panamanians have rarely
been able to vote for a president.
   In 1940, voters elected Arnulfo Arias Madrid, one of Panama's
most influential politicians to the day he died in 1988.
   Arias Madrid was elected to the presidency three times. He is
thought to have been cheated of victory by fraud in 1984, one year
after Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega took control of the nation.
   Despite his success, Arias Madrid only managed to govern the
country for 2{ years in all; he was toppled by coups three times.
In 1968, he served just 11 days before he was overthrown.
   Even Arias Madrid was not a model democrat. He was an admirer of
European fascism, and some admirers still refer to him as
``caudillo,'' the title taken by dictator Francisco Franco of Spain.
   In 1972, after four years of junta rule, a president was
elected, but the new constitution gave complete control to Gen.
Omar Torrijos, a charismatic populist who made no bones about his
dominance.
   He, not the president, signed the treaties by which the United
States turns over the Panama Canal at the end of the century.
   Torrijos died in a plane crash in 1981. In 1983, Noriega, his
intelligence chief, came to power.
   When another election was permitted in 1984, Arias Madrid looked
like a winner until the count was halted. After 10 days, Nicolas
Ardito Barletta was proclaimed victor.
   Noriega has since imposed and deposed presidents at will.
   Last year, President Eric Delvalle tried to fire Noriega after
the general was indicted on drug-trafficking and money-laundering
charges in Florida. Noriega, who has denied the charges, forced out
Delvalle.
   Manuel Solis Palma was named ``Minister in Charge of the
Presidency.'' He is scheduled to turn power over to the new
president on Sept. 1.
   The U.S. government imposed economic sanctions against Panama in
an attempt to oust Noriega but Noriega has toughed it out.
   Sunday's vote provided little solace for democracy-minded
Panamanians.
   Witnesses said Noriega's troops moved in to seize vote-tally
sheets when it looked like his candidate, Carlos Duque, was losing
to Arias Madrid follower Guillermo Endara.
   According to Carter, who acted as an international election
observer, Noriega had believed that Duque would win fairly but
decided on a steal when things began to look bad.
   The core of Duque's support came from the poor and from
descendants of black Caribbean immigrants, many brought in to work
on the canal.
   The rebellion against Noriega has been led by the middle class.
However, that group has a lot to lose and does not have a
reputation for being willing to fight for democracy.
   ``The people will not go into the streets _ not because we are
cowards but because we are not stupid. Why get shot and killed?''
asked human rights activist Otilia Koster.
   ``It will not be like the Philippines,'' she said, referring to
the military-civlian revolt that brought millions into the streets
to topple Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.
   Retiree Carlos Halphen said he didn't know what the opposition
could do. Like many Panamanians since the days of Roosevelt, he was
looking to the north.
   ``We want the United States to do something. The U.S. got us
into this, it should get us out,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fire On a Ship _ A Nightmare</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fire on a ship, an enclosed space made
primarily of heat-conducting metal, can turn into a nightmare for
seamen trying to extinguish the blaze, experts say.
   The latest example came when fire broke out on the USS White
Plains, killing six people and injuring five. The blaze on the Navy
supply ship in the South China Sea was apparently caused by a fuel
leak, officials said Tuesday.
   Guy Colonna, a marine specialist with the National Fire
Protection Association, a Quincy, Mass., organization that works to
develop fire protection standards, said a major problem confronting
firefighters aboard a ship is restrictions on the use of water.
   ``The way to fight fire is with water _ obviously at sea you
can't add too much or you sink the vessel or impair its
stability,'' he said. ``You can't pour water on it the way you
would on land.''
   Maj. Dave Neudorfer, who works in the Navy's safety and
survivability division, said water used to dampen a blaze has to be
pumped off the ship to keep the vessel afloat.
   Another hazard is intense heat that builds up on a ship, with
temperatures often reaching 3,000 degrees Farhenheit. ``Metal
conducts heat rapidly ... and an all-metal facility is not like a
building where you have cement walls,'' Colonna said.
   A Navy source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the heat
on the White Plains was so hot sailors were limited to five-minute
stints in fighting the blaze.
   Additionally, ships are compartmentalized, frequently making it
difficult to move equipment from deck to deck, Colonna said. An
explosion that ripped through the No. 2 gun turret of the USS Iowa
last month was contained to that area. Forty-seven men were killed.
   Colonna, who was formerly in the Coast Guard, said the Navy
trains all sailors in fire-fighting techniques, but special
casualty control teams spring into action when fire breaks out.
   Even so, Neudorfer said on-the-ground training is a
``kindergarten situation'' compared to a ship-board fire, which
often produces billowing smoke and toxic fumes from material used
to coat electrical cables and insulate equipment.
   Repair lockers containing hoses and breathing equipment are
normally kept at each end of the ship, Colonna said. In a large
ship like an aircraft carrier, equipment bins are located at
various places.
   But fire affects everyone one board because it can disable a
ship's navigation and steering equipment and electricity, he said.
``When they have a fire, it's almost like a military operation,''
he said. ``It's a nightmare; things are going on and people have
their jobs to do.''
   The Navy, meantime, is continually trying to upgrade its ability
to cope with fires, particularly using new technologies, Neudorfer
said.
   ``We're challenging the technical world to come up with fire
resistant coating on electrical cables,'' he said.
   Moreover, the Navy is looking at so-called ``sticky water'' that
does not evaporate when it is doused on a fire.
   On a practical level, the Navy recently introduced special
fire-fighting coveralls for sailors, and is looking at
manufacturing taller boots.
   What they found on the USS Stark was that ``water was coming
over the boots and burning their feet,'' Neudorfer said.
   Thirty-seven sailors were killed when the Stark was hit by a
Iraqi missile in the Persian Gulf in May, 1987. Crew members
battled for 24 hours to bring under control the fires set off by
the attack.

<HEAD>White Plains is Aging `Floating Grocery Store' for 7th Fleet Ships</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The USS White Plains is an aging but essential
support ship that serves as a floating grocery store for vessels
assigned to the Navy's 7th Fleet.
   The 581-foot food stores ship has been based at the Pacific
island of Guam since 1984 and was returning there Tuesday after a
deployment to the northern Arabian Sea in support of Persian Gulf
operations. It was attached to the aircraft carrier Constellation
and its battle group during the deployment.
   According to Navy records, the White Plains is more than 20
years old but there is no history of any past serious problems
aboard the vessel involving accidents or its machinery.
   The vessel, the fourth in the so-called Mars class of food
supply ships, carries the Navy designation AFS-4 and was
constructed by the National Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co. of San Diego,
Calif. The ship's keel was laid down on Oct. 2, 1965; it was
launched on July 26, 1966, and then commissioned into active
service on Nov. 23, 1968.
   It has since undergone several major overhauls.
   The ship has spent its entire life plying the waters of the
Pacific and Indian Oceans, at various points calling San Francisco
and the Japanese ports of Sasebo and Yokosuka home in addition to
Guam.
   The White Plains joined the fleet in time for numerous and
lengthy deployments during the Vietnam War and earned seven battle
stars for its performance. Even after American troops were
withdrawn from Vietnam, the White Plains drew additional duty in
the South China Sea supporting warships that had been ordered to
retrieve underwater mines sown in North Vietnamese waters.
   The ship has participated in training exercises with a number of
foreign navies, includes those of South Korea and Australia, and
also served as a ``mercy ship'' following natural catastrophes.
   For example, it carried relief supplies to Guam and other
islands in the Mariana chain in 1976 after Typhoon Pamela. Later
that same year the ship drew another special mission, ordered
without notice to the Indian Ocean to support a carrier task force
monitoring a flare-up in hostilities between Kenya and Uganda.

<HEAD>Schlesinger Says Oil Stockpile is Losing its Security Value</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's emergency stockpile of oil is
losing its value as a shield against an energy crisis, former
energy secretary James Schlesinger told Congress.
   Schlesinger told a House Banking subcommittee Tuesday that the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve was being undermined by the nation's
growing appetite for imported oil.
   ``As a protective device it offers less and less protection,''
Schlesinger said.
   Although the government is continuing to fill the oil reserve,
imports are growing even faster. As a result, the reserves would
not stretch as far in an emergency as they would have just a few
years ago, he said.
   The salt caverns in Louisiana and Texas that hold about 565
million barrels of government crude oil could replace about 70 days
of imports at the current import rate of 8 million barrels a day.
Four years ago the oil reserve was equal to 115 days of imports.
   ``It is particularly distressing to me that this principle
bulwark is being undermined,'' Schlesinger said, adding that
national security is weakened as the United States grows more
vulnerable to a cutoff of oil imports.
   Coincidentally, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins was touring a
Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage site in Louisiana on Tuesday to
watch a test of the system that would be used in an actual
emergency to pump the oil out of the caverns.
   The reserve, which was started in 1975 in response to the Arab
oil embargo, has never been used.
   The United States currently relies on imports for about 44
percent of its supplies, and the Energy Department has projected
the rate will reach at least 65 percent by the turn of the century.
The highest rate in U.S. history was 46 percent in 1977.
   Schlesinger said the country was likely to face an even greater
reliance on foreign oil in the 1990s as domestic oil production
continues to decline and consumption grows.
   Robert W. Fri, president of Resources for the Future, an
independent research institute, told the subcommittee Congress
should increase the target level of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
to 1 billion barrels. The target under existing legislation is 750
million barrels, which is expected to be reached in 1995.
   The Energy Department said last month in a report prepared for
Congress that it would take more than $6 billion and at least 10
years to expand the reserve to 1 billion barrels. The cost estimate
was based on the current price of imported oil.
   The report did not take a position on whether the reserve should
be expanded but said an interagency group was making a detailed
analysis of the costs and benefits of expansion. The group's
recommendations are due later this year.

<HEAD>Civilian Rule in Guatemala Still Buffetted by Military</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Vinicio Cerezo and
his Defense Minister took pains to emphasize that the military
rebellion that sought their ouster was the work of a small sector
of the armed forces.
   At a news conference just hours after Tuesday's coup attempt was
put down, they said the action was crushed with relative ease.
   That the rebellion was put down without a shot being fired was
good news indeed for Cerezo and Gen. Hector Gramajo and supportive
of the decade-old trend of military-to-civilian rule in Latin
America.
   Still, that a coup attempt was mounted at all shows that the
tradition of military rule dies hard. Nearly 3{ years into Cerezo's
five-year term, Guatemala is struggling to solidify the foundation
of what would be its first modern democratic period.
   Civilian authority remains conditioned on military consent and
supervision.
   ``The army is doing everything possible so that the era of coups
pertains to the past,'' Gramajo told The Associated Press in
August, three months after his forces quashed an uprising similar
to Tuesday's. ``Nonetheless, traditional forces are doing
everything possible so that it does not. As of now, I'm winning.''
   He would probably contend he is still winning.
   ``It pains me to have to report on this because the action of a
minority affects the prestige and attitude of the entire
institution,'' he told Tuesday's news conference.
   But it is difficult to imagine Gramajo would candidly agree with
Cerezo's sweeping declaration that, ``The army has once again
fulfilled its responsibility ... and there is no problem.''
   Gramajo said Tuesday's uprising appeared to be an attempt to
revive the rebellion that occurred nearly a year ago.
   ``The officers who were cashiered came up with this way of
celebrating last year's coup attempt and keeping the movement
alive,'' he said.
   He referred to two colonels, a captain and a major expelled from
the armed forces after their bid to overthrow the government was
thwarted last May 11. He said the four were among 12 officers
involved in Tuesday's rebellion.
   Gramajo last year blamed rightist civilian landowners,
businessmen and industrialists _ the ``traditional forces'' _ for
fomenting the coup bid.
   Representatives of the agro-export and business organizations
alluded to as sponsors of the rebellion denied they participated.
   Cerezo told the news conference that no civilians were
immediately implicated in the latest move against him. But he said
the coup attempt would be investigated and any civilians involved
prosecuted.
   Gramajo said rebel air force troops backed by two helicopter
gunships and an A-37 warplane had blocked two major highways on the
edges of the capital Tuesday and that rebel troops also tried to
march on his home.
   He said the rebels, numbering at least 300, turned back when
they encountered a superior force of loyalist troops.
   Gramajo and Cerezo said all but two of the coup plotters were in
custody as well as an unspecified number of soldiers.
   That the subversive movement of last year's plotters could be
``kept alive'' undermined Gramajo's contention that, because of the
1988 rebellion, the army was stronger and more cohesive.
   ``We had the chance to discover vulnerabilities and we corrected
them,'' he said in August. But the military, as demonstrated by
Tuesday's rebellion, is not monolithic.
   Gramajo acknowledged in last year's interview that for most of
this century power was in the hands of a corporate institution
comprising the business and agricultural capital and the armed
forces. Their alliance provided sumptuous wealth to a tiny minority
while relegating the majority, most of whom are Mayan Indian
peasants, to extreme poverty.
   Cerezo, a centrist Christian Democrat, was bent on at least some
redistribution of wealth when he took office. Though he has seen
most of his initiatives thwarted by established interests, the far
right considers heretical even the intention to chip away at its
privilege.
   He said the most significant development in recent Guatemalan
history is the ``process of breaking that bond between the
traditional sector and the army.''
   But he quickly added: ``This is a process. It is not yet a
deed.''

   A man armed with an assault rifle commandeered a
small plane late Tuesday and fired shots from the low-flying
aircraft into downtown Boston after killing his estranged wife,
authorities said.
   The man was captured at about 1:15 a.m. Wednesday when,
apparently running out of fuel, he landed the Cessna at Logan
International Airport, authorities said.
   No injuries were reported from the shots fired from the plane.
   At one point, the man, a licensed pilot, flew over the Boston
Postal Annex, where he works, said State Trooper Paul Perry,
   The man fled Danvers, about 30 miles north of Boston, after his
estranged wife was shot three times with an automatic rifle, stole
a car at gunpoint, commandeered the plane from an employee at the
Beverly Municipal Airport and took off sometime before 10:30 p.m.,
said Danvers police Sgt. Richard Landers.
   Landers said police were called to a Danvers home for a domestic
disturbance around 9:45 p.m., and found the body of the suspect's
estranged wife. Neither the suspect nor his wife have been
identified.
   Witnesses reported hearing shots and seeing the suspect flee in
a van.
   The suspect drove to nearby Peabody, where he stole a car at
gunpoint, said state Tropper Byron Rizos. The car owners told
police the suspect was carrying some type of assault rifle, the
trooper said.
   The suspect used the second car to drive to the Beverly airport,
where he stole the plane, Rizos said.

<HEAD>Country Star Keith Whitley Dead at 33 From Alcohol Overdose</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Country music singer Keith Whitley,
known for wrenching, honky-tonk-style ballads that embraced pain
and joy, was found dead at his home Tuesday after overdosing on
alcohol, officials said. He was 33.
   Whitley was found fully clothed in his bed by his
brother-in-law, Lane Palmer, said Lt. Harry Bell of the
Goodletsville Police Department just north of Nashville.
   An autopsy showed the singer died of an accidental overdose of
alcohol, said Medical Examiner Charles Harlan. The singer's blood
alcohol content was .477, almost five times the amount to be
declared intoxicated in Tennessee, Harlan said.
   Cocaine and Valium were also in Whitley's system, according to
autopsy results released later.
   The drugs may have contributed to the singer's death, Harlan
said, but the cause was drinking too much alcohol in too short a
time.
   The Sandy Hook, Ky., native's alcohol problem had plagued him
for years. In an interview last October, he said his heavy drinking
had nearly killed him and that he had quit in 1987.
   ``It was a matter of life and death,'' Whitley said. ``If I
hadn't stopped drinking, I don't think I'd be alive today. I did so
many crazy things while drinking.''
   Whitley had just recorded an album in Nashville, to be released
in the fall, said Brenna Davenport-Leigh, spokeswoman for his
record label, RCA Records. ``Keith was very active on the road.
He's been touring,'' she said. Whitley's latest album, ``Don't
Close Your Eyes,'' has had three No. 1 singles since it was
released last year, including last month's ``I'm No Stranger to the
Rain.''
   The title song was nominated by the Academy of Country Music for
song and single record of the year. His other hit records included
``Miami My Amy,'' ``Ten Feet Away,'' ``Homecoming '63'' and ``Hard
Livin'.''
   As a teen-ager, he played in Ralph Stanley's bluegrass band and
later was lead singer for the country-bluegrass band J.D. Crowe and
the New South.
   Whitley survived his reckless teen-age years and battled his
stubborn drinking problem to become one of country music's emerging
stars, along with Randy Travis and Dwight Yoakam.
   He moved to Nashville from Kentucky in the mid-1980s and landed
a recording contract with RCA.
   ``There will always be a special place in my heart for Keith
Whitley, and I'm sorry people will be deprived of his great
talent,'' said his manager, Jack McFadden.
   ``Keith was the type of individual you'd like to live next door
to and like to go fishing with every Saturday,'' McFadden said.
   Whitley's wife, Lorrie Morgan, a Grand Ole Opry singer, was on a
tour heading toward Alaska when her husband died.
   Besides his wife, Whitley is survived by a son and a daughter.

<HEAD>Former Oil Employees Say Stealing Oil From Indian Wells is Common</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former employees of a Kansas-based oil company
say they were pressured to steal oil from wells on Indian land, and
their company was not alone in the practice.
   Gene Poteet, a former gauger for Koch Industries of Wichita,
Kan., told a Senate committee Tuesday that his nephew worked for an
oil firm that told him, ``If he couldn't steal his wages, they
didn't need him.'' Poteet did not name the firm.
   Poteet and James Spaulding, another former gauger for Koch,
testified before a special committee of the Senate Select Committee
on Indian Affairs, which is investigating theft of oil from and
underpayment of oil royalties to Indians.
   As gaugers, both men were employed to measure oil from tanks at
well sites into either a pipeline or onto trucks for sale by Koch,
which does a large amount of business on Indian oil fields.
   They said the company expected them to ``mismeasure'' so that
more oil would be received than paid for.
   Spaulding said that when he resisted, he was informed that Koch
``would send one their gaugers to reteach me.''
   Spaulding said he worked for Koch from 1984 until 1988, when he
was fired for refusing to work Sundays. Poteet, who worked for the
company from 1979 to 1984, said he quit because ``I didn't agree
with their practices.''
   Spaulding said when he went to work for another oil company,
Union Texas, he caught the employee who replaced him at Koch
stealing oil from Union Texas. Union Texas then canceled its
contracts with Koch, he said.
   Donald L. Cordes, Koch Industries vice president for legal and
corporate affairs, issued a statement Tuesday saying testimony and
information during the hearing was incomplete and created a false
impression.
   Cordes said the Senate panel didn't reveal that the so-called
overages being attributed to Koch represent a minute percentage of
the total oil the company buys and resells. He said Koch crude oil
purchases were measured short the first two months of 1989, and the
overage for 1988 was .0023 of the total volume of crude oil handled
and measured by the company.
   ``This percentage is well within the range of overage
percentages reflected in the reports of the states which compile
that data,'' Cordes said. Overage reports from Texas and Louisiana,
for example, show many other companies with higher percentages,
Cordes said.
   A spokesman for the Senate panel said that depositions were
taken with Koch officials, though they were not called to testify.
   Investigators told the committee that Koch consistently took
hundreds of thousands more barrels of crude oil than it paid for
during the last three years. A certain amount of mismeasuring is
normal in the industry, but not to the degree shown in documents
subpoenaed from Koch, witnesses said.
   The documents indicated that Koch ended 1986 with 803,874 more
barrels of oil than it paid for, 1987 with 671,144 more barrels and
1988 with 474,281 extra barrels. The value of the excess oil was
estimated at $12.2 million in 1986, $11.9 million in 1987 and $7.1
million in 1988.
   Chris Tucker, an independent oil expert who investigated Koch,
said most companies mismeasure accidentally but ``try to be as
accurate as possible.
   ``At year's end, they try to get to zero (difference),'' he said.
   Tucker was hired to investigate the company by a brother of the
owner, Charles Koch, according to a Senate panel spokesman, who
indicated the brothers had quarreled.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., who chairs the special
committee, said findings from the investigation would be referred
to the Justice Department.
   All of the witnesses who testified Tuesday said it is easy to
steal oil from Indian land because no one supervises the purchasers
when they take oil from tanks at the wells.
   Two Caudo Indians from Gracemont, Okla., said they receive
royalties from three wells in Oklahoma, but have noticed their
individual checks have decreased from $3,000 per month to $1,000
despite the rising price of oil.
   Thurmon Parton and Arnita Gonzalez said they learned from
investigators for the committee that a gauger from Koch Industries
had been caught stealing from their wells.
   Neither Parton nor Gonzalez is employed, and both say they
depend on their royalty checks to pay their bills.

   Keith Whitley, a rising star of country
music who followed the hard-living lifestyle he sang about in
wrenching tunes chronicling pain and joy, has died of alcohol
abuse. He was 33.
   The body of the bearded, handsome performer was found in bed at
his suburban home Tuesday afternoon.
   An autopsy showed a blood alcohol content of 0.477, medical
examiner Charles Harlan said. That's almost five times the 0.10
considered intoxicated for driving in Tennessee.
   Traces of cocaine and Valium also were found in his system but
alcohol overdose was cited as the direct cause of death, Harlan
said.
   Harlan said it was impossible to tell what kind of alcoholic
beverages Whitley had consumed or over what period.
   Whitley's body was found by his brother-in-law, Lane Palmer, who
was concerned because the performer was not answering phone calls,
said Lt. Harry Bell of the suburban Goodlettsville Police
Department.
   His wife, Lorrie Morgan, a Grand Ole Opry singer and daughter of
the late Opry great George Morgan, was en route for a performance
in Alaska when her husband died. Police said she was notified in
Seattle and was heading home.
   Whitley's latest album, ``Don't Close Your Eyes,'' has had three
No. 1 singles since it was released last year: the title song;
``When You Say Nothing at All''; and ``I'm No Stranger to the
Rain,'' which reached No. 1 a month ago.
   The title song was a finalist this year for the Academy of
Country Music's song and single record of the year.
   His other hit singles include ``Miami My Amy,'' ``Ten Feet
Away,'' ``Homecoming '63'' and ``Hard Livin.' ''
   In an interview in October, Whitley said he had been a heavy
drinker until 1987 and that his thrill-a-minute lifestyle nearly
killed him.
   ``It was a matter of life and death,'' he said. ``If I hadn't
stopped drinking, I don't think I'd be alive today. I did so many
crazy things while drinking.''
   He said that at age 17, he was in a car with a companion who
attempted to round a curve at 120 mph in their native eastern
Kentucky. The car wrecked, killing his friend. Whitley suffered
only cuts.
   Two years later, Whitley drove off a 120-foot cliff into a
frozen river, escaping with a broken collarbone.
   ``There were a lot less serious serious accidents and brushes
with the law,'' he said in the interview.
   Whitley, a native of Sandy Hook, Ky., began singing at age 4. As
a teen-ager, he played in the bluegrass band of Ralph Stanley and
later was lead singer for J.D. Crowe and the New South, a
country-bluegrass band.
   After earning the reputation as a fine musician and singer, he
moved to Nashville in the mid-1980s and landed a recording contract
with RCA.
   His ``I'm No Stranger to the Rain'' was about life's setbacks.
``Don't Close Your Eyes'' was about the desperation of love and
``When You Say Nothing at All'' was more positive, celebrating
tenderness.
   ``Most of the things I sing in my songs, I've lived,'' he said
in the interview.
   ``The whole deal with my music has been the emotional quality.
Songs I do have to strike an emotional chord the first time I sing
them. It's not uncommon for me to get so wrapped up in a song that
I cry several times when I sing them. That's the difference between
my music and some of the other folks.''
   Another album was to be released this fall.
   Whitley is survived by his wife, 2-year-old son Jesse Keith, and
daughter, Morgan Whitley, 8.

<HEAD>Computer To Pluck Names for 20,000 Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hopes and dreams of more than 3 million
people seeking to enter the United States now rest with a computer
designed to pluck the winners of a special ``visa lottery'' from
their applications.
   The State Department announced on Tuesday that some 20,000
nominees will be chosen at random by the computer, making them
eligible for visas granting entry into the country in 1991 or 1992.
   ``The so-called `visa lottery' is now over _ 3.2 million people
applied sucessfully'' to enter the pool of potential winners,
spokesman Richard Boucher told reporters.
   Near-riots were touched off at U.S. embassies and diplomatic
posts around the world after the State Department announced the
special program, under which nearly anyone from 162 countries could
apply.
   Telephones rang off the hook and embassy entryways were snarled
at posts ranging from Cairo, Egypt, to Bucharest, Romania, as
people lined up for information.
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., the author of the legislation that
made the new program possible, is slated to open the first few
application envelopes selected by the computer and announce the
nationalities of the nominees at a special ceremony on Monday.
   ``It gives people a little better shot than (betting on) the
Pennsylvania lottery,'' Berman quipped in an interview.
   Berman said he is pleased that his legislation has received such
an enthusiastic response from around the world.
   ``Obviously, a lot of people want to come to America,'' he said.
   The congressman said his program was designed as a ``stop-gap
measure,'' in an attempt to bring some diversity to the U.S.
immigration flow.
   Normally, an applicant for an immigrant visa has to have a close
relative in the United States or work in a valued profession.
   Berman said he believes that there must be a ``fundamental
reform'' of the U.S. immigration law. He has introduced separate
legislation designed to create an independent category for
immigrants that would allow some 60,000 persons into the country
yearly, based on criteria such as their education or job skills.
   It will take some months for those who have applied to know
whether or not their applications were successful, according to
Frances Jones of the department's Consular Affairs Office.
   Once the computer picks the applicants, the names of the
nominees will be sent to the U.S. posts around the world, which
will in turn contact the chosen individuals, she said.
   ``If they haven't heard by October, they should know they
haven't been selected,'' Ms. Jones said.
   She said she is still receiving some applications, even though
they were accepted only during the month of March.
   Winning the lottery doesn't automatically gain applicants entry
_ they must then meet the basic requirements for entry, such as
good health and absence of criminal contacts.
   Those who do win a visa and come to the United States could
apply for citizenship later on if they meet the strict criteria for
that status, Ms. Jones added.
   The last lottery for visas was held in 1986. It was more
restrictive than the current program and allowed only 10,000 visas,
with some 1.4 million applicants losing out.
   The countries excluded from the program were those that used
more than 5,000 immigrant slots in fiscal 1988.
   They were China, Colombia, Dominican Republic, El Salvador,
Guyana, Haiti, India, Jamaica, South Korea, Mexico, the Philippines
and the United Kingdom.
   Also excluded were natives of Taiwan, Anguilla, Bermuda, British
Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Falkland Islands, Gibraltar, Hong
Kong, Montserrat, Pitcairn, St. Helena, and the Turks and Caicos
islands.

<HEAD>NFL Players, Coaches Testify About Steroid Use Before Senate Committee</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Use of steroids ``is rampant within the
National Football League,'' with perhaps three-fourths of linemen,
linebackers and tight ends using the muscle-building drugs in a
desperate effort to stay competitive, says All-Pro tackle Bill
Fralic.
   ``Steroid use in football represents a vicious cycle,'' the
Atlanta Falcon player told a Senate committee Tuesday. ``I know
there are many players in high school, college and the NFL who want
to stop using steroids, but they can't or won't because they don't
believe they can be competitive without them.''
   The Senate Judiciary Committee also heard an estimate from
former Pittsburgh Steeler Steve Courson that at least half of pro
players at so-called line-of-scrimmage positions use steroids.
   The estimates made by the two players, however, were disputed by
two head coaches who also appeared as witnesses, Marty
Schottenheimer of the Kansas City Chiefs and Chuck Noll of the
Steelers.
   It was the committee's second hearing this year on the
muscle-building substances, initially used by body builders and
power lifters, which were introduced into the NFL in the 1960s when
weight training became commonplace.
   A bill to ban steroids from the mail and designate them a
controlled substance like narcotic drugs has been introduced by
committee Chairman Joseph Biden, D-Del., and member Sen. Strom
Thurmond, R-S.C.
   But witnesses could not agree on how widespread the problem is.
   NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle cited an official league estimate
that 6 percent to 7 percent of players use steroids, but conceded
that figure might not be accurate.
   ``I thought that's a low figure ... I thought it might be
higher,'' Rozelle said.
   Biden asked Schottenheimer and Noll to comment on estimates that
50 percent to 70 percent of NFL players use steroids.
   ``I would have difficulty, Senator, in imagining that it would
be that high,'' said Schottenheimer.
   ``I can't imagine that figure as being completely accurate,''
said Noll.
   But Fralic estimated that ``exclusive of quarterbacks, running
backs and wide receivers, it's probably 75 percent.'' He said
steroid use was far more prevalant among offensive linemen,
defensive linemen, linebackers and tight ends.
   Courson also said positions requiring bulk and muscle along the
line of scrimmage are the ones with the most steroid users _ at
least 50 percent among linemen.
   ``NFL owners can't grasp this problem,'' Fralic said. ``They
haven't been living in the middle of the steroid madness. They
can't see their friends affected by it.''
   He also charged that ``coaches at every level turn their back to
the steroids situation.
   ``High school coaches are trying to build an impressive record
for their resume or to build their status within a community,''
Fralic said. ``College coaches face tremendous pressure to win. And
pro coaches are judged on only one basis, their win-loss record.
The cycle keeps repeating itself and a monster problem is growing.''
   Noll expressed doubts that steroids actually benefit players.
   But both players, as well as coaches Joe Paterno of Penn State
and Bo Schembechler of Michigan, told the committee that steroids
do enhance performance.
   ``I could not tell you for sure that we do not have kids taking
steroids,'' Paterno said, despite the presence of a university
testing program.
   He said Penn State is considering inserting a steroids clause
into its game contracts with other schools in an effort to avoid
placing the Nittany Lions in competition with teams with an unfair
chemical advantage.
   In other testimony, Gene Upshaw, executive director of the
National Football League Players Association, told the panel a poll
of players indicated that 75 percent of the union opposes random
testing for steroid use.
   Fralic, however, said his own poll of the Falcons showed 80
percent of the players would go along with random testing. The 20
percent who opposed such testing feared how management might
respond to positive tests, he said.
   Steroids are illegal if bought, sold or imported without a
prescription. Health experts say prolonged use of the drug without
proper supervision can contribute to heart trouble, sexual and
reproductive disorders, immune deficiencies, liver problems,
psychological disturbances and growth disorders.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: North Pardon is Touchy Issue for Bush</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush White House is treading carefully
over the issue of a pardon for Oliver North, whom the president has
several times called a hero. It's clearly a touchy subject.
   On Tuesday, Bush declared he had ``wanted all along to see him
exonerated,'' but declined to comment further on last week's guilty
verdicts. He brushed aside a question on whether he was considering
a pardon for North.
   At the White House, officials apparently don't like the word
``consider'' when it comes to talking about a pardon for the
retired Marine lieutenant colonel.
   ``We don't have any comment on the North trial or the
conclusion,'' presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater told
reporters after the former White House aide was convicted of three
felony counts in the Iran-Contra affair. ``And we haven't discussed
a pardon.''
   Asked what that meant, Fitzwater said: ``There has been no
discussion of a pardon whatsoever.''
   A reporter then asked Fitzwater point blank: ``Could you put it
direct and just say the president's not considering a pardon for
Mr. North?''
   ``The president has not discussed a pardon,'' he said.
   ``Well, what does that mean?''
   Fitzwater: ``It means he hasn't discussed it.''
   ``Is he considering it or will he consider it?''
   Fitzwater: ``He hasn't discussed it.''
   ``Who is he supposed to discuss it with?''
   Fitzwater: ``Anybody.''
   A day later, Fitzwater was again asked, ``Any change about the
consideration or lack of consideration of a pardon for Ollie
North?''
   ``Not discussing it,'' Fitzwater said.
   The president wasn't much in the mood for discussing it, either,
on Tuesday when he was asked by a reporter whether he believed
North to be innocent.
   ``I'm not going to argue with the courts,'' Bush said. ``The
process is being appealed. He's entitled to the right of appeal
without a lot of editorial comment from me, although I've already
given you some.''
   When he was asked if he believed in shredding documents _ one of
the counts on which North was convicted _ Bush joked, ``I believe
in taking them with me.''
   Late last month, the president told reporters aboard Air Force
One that he wouldn't even think about a pardon until the legal
proceedings were over _ and that he hadn't discussed it with
anyone, even his wife.
   The issue of a pardon for North is a stick of political dynamite
for the president, who over the past several years repeatedly has
had to deny his own role in the covert dealings that were at the
heart of the case against North.
   Bush has denied any advance knowledge of the Reagan
administration's efforts to sell arms to Iran and to divert the
profits to the Nicaraguan contra rebels.
   And just last week he insisted that a trip he made to Honduras
in 1985 _ a trip disclosed by a document released in the North
trial _ was not part of a scheme to exchange increased aid to
Honduras for help with the Contras.
   Still, despite these denials, the subject of Bush's involvement
or lack of involvement continues to linger.
   Some Democratic critics have said they find it difficult to
believe that Bush, a former CIA chief who claimed he was in on most
major Reagan administration decisions as vice president, could have
been as in the dark as he claims.
   Bush is no doubt mindful of the political backlash that
developed when then President Ford pardoned former President Nixon
in 1974. That action proved extremely unpopular among Americans.
   But at the same time, North is highly regarded among
conservatives, many of whom view him as a patriot _ one who was
just following orders.
   Bush probably isn't discussing the decision with others at the
White House, says Stephen Hess, a scholar who specializes in the
presidency at the Brookings Institution.
   ``George Bush seems to have a habit of making these big ones all
by himself, and they sometimes turn out to be surprises _ like his
choice of (Dan) Quayle (as his running mate).''
   ``I'm not sure what he'll do, but I'm sure that whatever it is,
it will come from his gut,'' said Hess. And, the analyst added,
Bush's decision on North will likely be based on inside information.
   ``He knows something that the rest of us don't know: to what
degree Oliver North was an unguided missile,'' Hess said.

<HEAD>Deaf University President Praises Bill to Ban Discrimination</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   I. King Jordan didn't hear the applause
filling the Senate hearing room when he finished his impassioned
plea for legislation to shield 43 million disabled Americans from
discrimination.
   But the deaf president of Gallaudet University could see it loud
and clear.
   Two ``signers'' had played Jordan's every word on their fingers
during his testimony Tuesday.
   When he finished, they were joined by dozens of others in the
audience in an unmistakable visual display as they held their hands
over their heads and waggled their fingers merrily in rhythm with
the sound of those clapping their hands together.
   It was an unusual hearing of the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   The No. 3 House Democrat, Rep. Tony Coelho of California,
started it off by describing how he felt ``suicidal'' after being
thrown out of a seminary because of his epilepsy until entertainer
Bob Hope convinced him to pursue his dreams of service by turning
to politics.
   Before the hearing was over, Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., pulled a
hearing aid from his right ear and held it aloft while recounting
in his booming baritone how an older colleague had approached him
when his own hearing started to fail and asked about the stigma of
wearing a hearing aid.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, lead author of the legislation
introduced Tuesday, said he had not meant to wax personal. But
after Jordan's testimony, Harkin was moved to talk about his own
deaf brother who, when taken to a special school for the deaf many
years ago, was told there were three areas of training open to him:
cobbler, printer or baker.
   ``He became a baker,'' recalled Harkin.
   The senator, who was chairing the hearing at the time, paused
for a moment, clearly reflecting on his now-retired brother.
   ``He never wanted to be a baker,'' he said quietly.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, called his brother-in-law who was
stricken by polio ``one of the greatest heroes I know.'' He spoke
cryptically but with quiet emotion of physically carrying the
disabled man through a Mormon temple in Los Angeles and of ``loving
him as a brother.''
   Hatch was the only committee member who voiced any reservations
about the bill, but he emphasized that his problems were not with
its intent but with some details.
   ``I'm dedicated to working this out,'' said Hatch.
   ``There is not a disabled American alive today who has not
experienced some form of discrimination,'' Jordan said at the
outset of his testimony.
   Speaking in a loud, clear voice full of passion, Jordan _ who
lost his hearing in a motorcycle accident when he was 21 _
recounted how he became the first deaf president of the university
for the deaf last year after the students rose up against
appointment of another hearing president.
   Jordan noted that legislation creating the Washington school was
signed 125 years ago by President Abraham Lincoln.
   ``During the past 125 years, conditions of deaf and other
disabled Americans have slowly improved but, I regret to state, we
remain today far short of the American dream so eloquently
proclaimed by Dr. Martin Luther King,'' Jordan said.
   He suggested the student movement that brought about his
appointment ``captured the hearts of people throughout the nation''
and said he hoped the spirit they showed would accrue to ``the
bled and minority groups everywhere.''
   Even though the Harkis widespread support, it remains
controversial because its provisions would extend to people
infected with the AIDS virus and would impose certain costs on
private employers to make special provisions for handicapped
workers.
   Similar legislation failed last year, but Harkin said revisions
have been made to eliminate some of the opposition.
   For example, the new bill would require that only new buses used
in public transit systems would be required to have special
boarding aids for the handicapped, rather than saying all buses
must be retrofitted with suSen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee
chairman who
turned the hearing over to Harkin, said he expects to have the
Harkin bill up for consideration of the Senate floor by July.

<HEAD>Tufts, MIT Officials Deny Weakening Findings in Scientific Journal
Challenge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Top officials of Tufts University and MIT
insist they did not whitewash their findings when they investigated
a scientist's challenge of a colleague's article in a scientific
journal.
   The university officials said Tuesday that review panels took
seriously the complaint of former Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researcher Margot O'Toole but believed she overstated
deficiencies in the article.
   Ms. O'Toole told the House Energy and Commerce investigations
subcommittee she lost her job at MIT and her reputation was smeared
after she complained to both universities about the article
published in the journal Cell in April 1986.
   She testified that those who reviewed her complaint from the two
schools later accused her of stealing data, lying, refusing to
accept alternative interpretations and being unable to distinguish
between important and trivial issues.
   The article dealt with the immune responses of mice bred with an
extra immune system gene from another species. Ms. O'Toole
attempted to show the conclusions of the paper were not supported
by the original laboratory data.
   One of the authors was Thereza Imanishi-Kari, who is now on the
faculty of Tufts but in 1986 was in charge of the MIT laboratory
where Ms. O'Toole worked.
   John Deutch, provost of MIT, told the subcommittee that
reviewers found that O'Toole was correct in contending there was an
error in the article, but decided it was not flagrant and a
correction was not warranted.
   ``At the conclusion of the review, I concurred in the judgment
that the issues raised did not imply misconduct ...'' Deutch said.
``Any suggestion of misconduct in ... research is viewed with
concern.
   ``Our self-interest in our reputation as a leading research
university required that the integrity of our research be our first
priority.''
   Henry Wortis, a pathology professor at Tufts and one of those
who reviewed the challenge, said investigations at his school, MIT
and the National Institutes of Health found ``the original
conclusions of the paper are legitimate. I stress this point: the
conclusions are correct.''
   Wortis also criticized the committee probe as ``yet another
inquiry, this time by non-scientists into the same matter.''
   Ms. O'Toole said, ``I challenged the paper because it
represented evidence that simply did not exist, period. This is not
a complicated concept. It is one thing to believe that something is
true. It is another to present experimental evidence in support of
the claim.''
   A review panel convened by NIH said that although there was no
fraud or misrepresentation, errors had occurred that should be
corrected. The NIH investigation was reopened after two members of
the review panel were replaced when it was revealed they had ties
to one of the authors.
   A report from Secret Service experts said at least five and
possibly 25 pages in one of Ms. Imanishi-Kari's notebooks were
filled in as much as two years after the dates on the page, and at
least two dates were changed.
   Ms. O'Toole told the subcommittee she was forced to take a job
outside the field of science because of her challenge. She said she
learned that high-level Tufts administrators were told she made a
charge of fraud without justification, when it fact she had not
charged the article was fraudulent.
   She said she heard the MIT faculty was ``accusing me of
`purloining' or stealing laboratory notes. I had never done such a
thing, but I have since confirmed that this is how they described
my attempts to behave in a professionally responsible manner.'`

   Legislation requiring the oil industry to
train emergency response teams to quickly handle spills would help
protect ``the entire American coastline,'' says the New Jersey
congressman who introduced the bill.
   Rep. Jim Saxton, R-N.J., proposed the Clean Ocean Act of 1989 on
Tuesday to help mitigate the environmental hazards of oil spills.
He said he hoped to garner strong bipartisan support for the
measure, which is already backed by colleagues in California, Rhode
Island, Florida and Hawaii.
   ``The thrust of what we are doing today focuses on the entire
American coastline,'' Saxton said at a news conference. ``The fact
of the matter is that an oil spill can occur anywhere _ anywhere
oil is produced, where it is transported and where it is refined.''
   Saxton was named chairman in February of the Republican Research
Committee's Clean Oceans Task Force.
   Eight oil refineries are located along the Delaware River near
his district. Last year more than three-quarters of the 66 million
tons of cargo that moved through Delaware River ports were
petroleum products, he said.
   Saxton said his legislation would ensure that industry-funded
emergency crews can respond within five hours to spills such as the
March 24 accident that dumped 10 million gallons of crude oil into
Prince William Sound, Alaska, when the tanker Exxon Valdez ran
aground on a reef.
   That spill continues to spur legislation.
   Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg, D-N.J., expressing concern about the
possibility of a major oil spill in New York Harbor, on Monday
announced plans to introduce a bill requiring Coast Guard review
and approval of oil spill contingency plans.
   The measure would hold the federal government responsible for
determining when a cleanup was complete and would establish an oil
spill liability fund for cleanups if private companies lacked the
resources.
   On Tuesday, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, introduced a legislative
package to create a $500 million oil spill research and restoration
fund financed through a penny-a-barrel tax on refined domestic and
imported oil. The measure also would give the Coast Guard the
authority to assume immediate control of large or life-threatening
oil spills in Prince William Sound and use industry funds in
response to a major spill.
   Another Stevens bill would require tankers crossing the sound to
have equipment and vessels in place in the event of a spill and to
conduct practice drills at least twice a year. His measures would
allow oil companies to be sued in federal court if cleanup promises
were broken.
   Saxton's bill requires regionally located emergency teams to be
in place by Jan. 1, 1991. They must be certified by the Coast Guard
and subject to unannounced periodic drills.
   Violators face fines of $500,000 to $1 million, with chief
executive officers assuming liability, he said.
   Capt. Richard Larrabee, chief of the Coast Guard's environmental
response division, said current federal policy holds a spiller
responsible for timely and effective cleanup of his own spill.
   ``In effect, if the federal on-scene coordinator determines that
spiller is not acting effectively, then he steps in using federal
resources and cleans it up,'' Larrabee said.
   In addition, the Coast Guard has contingency plans in place for
each of its approximately 48 ports.
   States also may regulate the industry.

   A group of Chinese economists is backing a
radical proposal to use Chinese labor and Japanese capital to
develop the Soviet Far East, the world's largest untapped
depository of natural resources.
   The Ministry of Agriculture, meanwhile, is considering a
``massive cooperation program'' with the Soviet Union to grow crops
and process food in China's northeast.
   The proposals represent a new vision of Soviet-Chinese economic
relations, which now consist mainly of exchanging low-quality
Russian wood and iron ore for Chinese thermoses and canned foods.
   Both plans were formulated earlier this year as China and Soviet
officials haggled over the countries' first summit in 30 years.
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will come to China on May 15,
accompanied by trade representatives ready to discuss economic
relations.
   The proposals stem from a realization that the current barter
and border trade has its limits.
   Ten years ago there was little trade between the countries. Last
year, they signed contracts for about $3.25 billion in goods, but
because of transportation bottlenecks 25 percent of the Soviet
goods and 40 percent of the Chinese products were not delivered.
   Thousands of tons of goods also were returned because they were
shoddy.
   ``There's lots of hoopla about record-setting trade figures and
contracts but there's little future in that,'' said Fan Yueqiang,
head of the Institute of Development Studies, a think tank in
Beijing.
   ``We only sell each other things we can't sell for foreign
exchange,'' he said. ``They send us low-quality wood and we send
them second-class canned food.''
   Fan and his deputy, Han Xiaofeng, believe the future of
Chinese-Soviet trade is in combining Soviet technical skill and
natural resources with Chinese labor and capital from third
countries, such as Japan and South Korea.
   Labor export began last year when more than 100 Chinese
construction workers went to Zabaikalsk, a Soviet town that borders
China's Inner Mongolia. There they built a gymnasium, dormitories
and a dining hall. Earlier in the year, 77 peasants were given
1,000 acres to grow cucumbers and watermelons in the Soviet Union
north of Vladivostok on the coast of the Sea of Japan.
   ``We've found that if you put a tie around the neck of a Chinese
peasant and send him over the border, he turns into an agricultural
expert,'' Han said.
   Both projects were successful. This year, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported, more than 10,000 Chinese laborers will work
in the Soviet Union on a variety of projects involving agriculture,
forestry, fisheries and mining.
   The proposal for the Soviet Far East has its roots in a series
of plans stretching back decades to tap East Asia's vast economic
wealth.
   Senior Chinese government officials have quietly expressed
backing for the plan, and the Soviet Embassy in Beijing has met
with its proponents. Japan would provide the capital, and
newspapers in that nation have been abuzz with reports.
   Fan and Han have a personal interest in the project.
   During the ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution, they spent about
eight years planting rice in the mosquito-infested fields of
Longwangmiao, in a far-eastern corner of Heilongjiang Province
along the Soviet border.
   Like many Chinese from the cities, they were sent to the
countryside to farm and cleanse their minds of urban ways.
   ``I lost my youth in that province,'' said Fan, now in his
mid-40s. ``But I also got to know it. I understand clearly the
possibilities for economic ties with the Soviets.''
   The first step, Fan said, is for China and the Soviet Union to
carry out joint ventures.
   In the 1950s, when relations between the countries were close,
Soviet advisers worked on hundreds of projects around China as part
of Moscow's support for the Communist bloc.
   ``We don't want to see a return to those days of big brother's
help,'' Fan said. ``What we want now is business partners.''
   The countries are already discussing the possible sale of a
nuclear power plant to China. And officials in China's remote
Xinjiang province want Soviet help in mining, and drilling for oil
and gas.
   Next, the investment power of Japan and South Korea must be
brought into play.
   ``For years Japanese businessmen have been wanting to get a
piece of Siberia,'' Fan said. ``But one of the main problems was
labor. Chinese labor is cheap and our workers are hardy.''

<TEXT>
   U.S. automakers say they're working all out to
eliminate an ozone-destroying coolant from car air conditioners,
and a Vermont ban on the substance won't help.
   ``All they're really doing is hindering our progress from a
longer-term point of view,'' says Norm Nielsen, supervisor of
government regulatory programs at Chrysler Corp.
   ``The last thing we need is having separate standards in
states.''
   Vermont's Legislature last week enacted a bill to outlaw the
registration of cars with air conditioners using
chlorofluorocarbons beginning with the 1993 model year. Gov.
Madeleine Kunin has hailed the bill and is expected to sign it
within two weeks.
   Despite years of research into a replacement coolant, the
nation's Big Three automakers say they doubt they can meet the
deadline.
   ``There is no way any manufacturer will be able to modify its
entire car line for Vermont in essentially three years,'' said Ford
Motor Co. spokeswoman Beryl Goldsweig.
   Car air conditioners were singled out partly because they use
CFC-12, the chlorofluorocarbon that's considered most damaging to
the ozone layer. Home refrigerators use a different type of CFC.
   When CFC molecules rise into the atmosphere, they break down
ozone that envelops the Earth 15 to 20 miles up. Scientists say
that lets in extra solar radiation, increasing the incidence of
skin cancer and eye disease and damaging plants and animals crucial
to the food chain.
   Lobbyist Joan Mulhern of the Vermont Public Interest Research
Group has testified that car air conditioners are the nation's
single biggest source of ozone depletion, producing 26.6 percent of
the CFCs released into the environment. She cited U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency studies published in 1987.
   One of the options available to automakers is simply not selling
cars with air conditioners in Vermont.
   Although roughly 90 percent of all new cars sold nationally are
equipped with air conditioning, only about half are in Vermont,
said Charles Ffolliott, the state's representative of the National
Automotive Dealers Association. The state's average July high
temperature is a moderate 70 degrees.
   For years, the automakers have had to live with stiffer tailpipe
emission regulations for vehicles sold in California. But changing
a car to meet those requirements is relatively simple, they say.
   Ridding air conditioners of CFCs is much more complex than
merely substituting a new coolant, the companies say.
   ``The whole system has to be changed,'' said Douglas Mark, an
emission engineer for General Motors Corp. ``There's got to be
compressor and evaporator changes. Materials have to be
re-evaluated for seals and hoses.''
   Most of the research for a replacement coolant is going into a
substance labeled 134-A. It contains no CFCs but isn't as efficient
as CFC-12, so air conditioners using 134-A would have to be larger.
   Automakers also say they are having trouble finding a lubricant
that can stand up to 134-A, and that tests to ensure the substance
carries no health risks won't be complete in time to meet the
Vermont deadline.
   Chrysler's Nielsen said the Vermont law, if imitated by other
states, has the potential of slowing down work on an ozone-friendly
air conditioner.
   But the automakers' protests don't bother Vermont's governor.
   ``We are a role model, and we may be a role model for the U.S.
Congress,'' Kunin said.
   CFCs were developed as a refrigerant in 1930 by a General Motors
chemist and had been considered ideal because they are non-toxic
and non-combustible. They are used widely as coolants and as
propellants, such as in spray cans.
   Under Vermont's bill, the sale of CFC-propelled noisemakers and
plastic party streamers, as well as non-commercial or
non-industrial uses of CFCs for cleaning photographic or electronic
equipment, would be banned next year.
   Supporters say it is the most far-reaching of any of the two
dozen ozone-protection bills introduced in state legislatures this
year. Hawaii's legislature is the only other to have passed an
ozone protection measure.
   Vermont's went farther than Hawaii's, which banned the release
of CFCs from car air conditioners during repairs.

<HEAD>GAO Says More Pentagon Programs Must be Cut to Avert $100 Billion
Shortfall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even though President Bush has cut $65 billion
from projected Pentagon budgets, the Defense Department will still
be $100 billion short over the next five years unless more programs
are reduced, according to the General Accounting Office.
   About half the shortfall stems from unrealistically low
assumptions about the future rate of inflation, the congressional
watchdog agency told the House Armed Services Committee.
   The report, which was scheduled to be released today, was
described by sources who declined to be identified.
   The GAO study involves the five-year Pentagon budget, which is
updated annually and forms the basis for future Defense Department
budget decisions, such as which weapons to buy.
   According to the GAO, all the spending in the current five-year
plan would cost more than $1.5 trillion, but the sources said the
actual spending projections are about $100 billion less than that.
   The GAO report is part of an ongoing debate between the
administration and the Democratic-controlled Congress about the
cost of defense spending.
   For the past four years, Congress has reduced or frozen the
Pentagon budgets and administration critics have charged that the
Pentagon is making unrealistic plans for future spending. When
those plans are changed, economic problems result, according to the
critics.
   Unrealistic planning means the Defense Department might be
forced to cancel weapons systems after they are started, as
evidenced by the current debate over the V-22 Osprey, the Marine
Corps plane recently canceled by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   The GAO report notes that Bush administration budget planners
are assuming that inflation will drop to 1.7 percent by 1994 and
calls that projection unrealistic, the sources said.
   According to the sources, that unrealistic figure will account
for about half the $100 billion.
   Most of the rest arises from plans by the Army, Navy, Marines,
and Air Forces to buy weapons that they won't be able to afford in
future years because of the current budget crunch, the sources
quoted the GAO report as saying.
   Bush reduced by about $65 billion the projected defense budgets
for fiscal 1990 through fiscal 1994. But according to the GAO, more
reductions are needed, the sources said.

<HEAD>Poll: Jackson Would Defeat Barry if DC Mayor's Race Held Today</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson could easily defeat District of
Columbia Mayor Marion S. Barry Jr. if an election were held today
between the mayor and the civil rights leader, a new poll says.
   According to the poll in today's Washington Post, Jackson would
win 68 percent of the vote to 17 percent for Barry. The poll also
found that Barry would lose to Police Chief Maurice A. Turner Jr.,
60 percent to 24 percent, and to three other possible challengers.
   Barry has been facing declining support because of questionable
behavior and mounting city problems.
   Despite Jackson's strong support, nearly half of those polled
said the former presidential candidate should stay out of the
mayoral race, while 40 percent approved of his running. Jackson
recently said he would consider moving from Chicago to Washington,
where he owns a house, and making a bid for mayor if Barry decided
not to run.
   Jackson would be required to establish residence in the district
for one year before the November 1990 election to be allowed to run.
   Barry for years was considered politically untouchable despite a
series of political missteps and the legal woes of many close
friends and associates.
   However, his popularity has been slipping since his visit to the
hotel room of a suspected drug dealer, Charles Lewis, in December,
which sparked an investigation into the city's controversial
involvement in a personnel project involving the Virgin Islands
government.
   Lewis was convicted of cocaine trafficking charges in the Virgin
Islands last month and has been indicted in Washington on 16 counts
of conspiracy, drug trafficking and perjury.
   If Barry chooses to run again, he would enter the race less
popular than any of his potential rivals, according to a Post
telephone survey of 1,021 registered voters conducted between April
28 and May 7. Six out of 10 disapprove of Barry's performance as
mayor.
   Barry dismissed the poll results, saying, ``It's clear to me
that the Washington Post wants me out of office and this poll fits
its plan.''
   Barry and all of his potential rivals are Democrats, although
Turner has indicated that if he chooses to run, he may run as an
independent or Republican.
   The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage
points.

   A prosecutor's decision to charge a woman with
manslaughter for the cocaine-induced death of her 2-day-old
daughter could backfire and scare other pregnant drug abusers from
seeking help, social workers say.
   Some medical and legal professionals also disagree with
Winnebago County State's Attorney Paul Logli's decision Monday to
charge Melanie Green, who became the second Rockford woman in a
week to be taken to court for exposing an unborn child to cocaine.
   ``It could very well drive these cocaine-abusing mothers
underground,'' said spokesman Dave Schneidman of the state
Department of Children and Family Services.
   ``You want to develop an atmosphere where they know (they) can
come into the health-care system and not be penalized. A punitive
approach is not going to benefit the children,'' said Dr. Ira J.
Chasnoff at Northwestern University Medical School, who has
directed studies on the effects of prenatal cocaine use.
   Early treatment for drug abuse works better, he said.
   ``The concern is that low-income women, who don't have access to
educational and medical programs that middle-class women do ...
might avoid the system altogether,'' said attorney Colleen Connell
with the American Civil Liberties Union in Chicago.
   The prosecutor defended his decision as a desire to protect
children.
   ``The actions of this office reflect the concern, sometimes the
outrage, of this community that children are born ... at risk, both
at birth and for many years,'' Logli said in a telephone interview
from Rockford, 85 miles northwest of Chicago.
   ``The aim is to protect children.''
   Ms. Green's baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. An autopsy said the
infant died of oxygen deprivation linked to cocaine exposure late
in the pregnancy.
   Ms. Green, 24, also was charged with delivery of a controlled
substance to a minor, Logli said.
   Involuntary manslaughter is a felony punishable by two to five
years in prison. The prosecutor said Ms. Green could face a 14-year
maximum penalty if she is convicted of the drug charge. She was
released on $3,500 bond. Arraignment is scheduled May 31, Logli
said.
   Schneidman said 90 percent of Illinois' cocaine babies are in
Cook County _ 1,095 of the 1,233 cases reported in 1988.
   Infants exposed to cocaine tripled to 27 in Rockford during the
past year, compared to the previous year, Logli said.
   Prenatal exposure can cause numerous health problems including
low birth weight, impaired motor ability, irritability that can
hinder learning, strokes and seizures.
   When a child dies after events that occurred ``while the child
was still in the womb, the law provides protection for that child
and allows for prosecution of the person who causes those events,''
he said.
   ``My job as a prosecutor is simply to charge those events where
violation of the law works toward the harm of others,'' Logli said.
   Logli said he was unaware of any similiar deaths in Illinois or
elsewhere.
   On May 1, a judge in Rockford convicted a juvenile mother of
child abuse and neglect for cocaine exposure during pregnancy. The
child, who shows no ill effects at 3 months, was temporarily
removed from her custody.
   A Florida woman was charged with child abuse and delivery of a
drug in December after her child was born addicted to cocaine.
Prosecutors said it was the first such case in that state.
   In 1987, a California judge dismissed a charge of failure to
provide medical care to a child, lodged against a woman whose son
was born brain damaged and later died. Prosecutors accused her of
ignoring a doctor's advice not to abuse drugs.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange erased
their morning gains and closed lower Wednesday, while the U.S.
dollar also fell back against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, a 103.37-point loser
Tuesday, dropped 38.54 more points, or 0.11 percent, to finish
trading at 33,993.33, despite a 75.12-point gain in the morning
session.
   The dollar ended at 134.44 yen, down 0.56 yen from Tuesday's
135.00 yen finish. The currency started trading at 134.42 yen and
ranged between 134.15-134.53 yen.
   ``After opening lower, the dollar-yen rate was hardly moving in
Tokyo,'' said an analyst with a commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Uncertainties over a possible interest rate hike by the Bank of
Japan have also made market players reluctant to make major moves
recently, he added.
   Media reports have mentioned the possibility of a hike in the
central bank's official interest rate from 2.5 percent to 3.0
percent, but the Bank of Japan has made no official announcements
so far.
   The analyst said the market was also waiting to see the U.S.
producer price index figure, scheduled to come out later this week.
   A Bank of Tokyo trader said the market started with ``a
dollar-selling mood'' in Tokyo, following a similar downtrend in
New York overnight, finishing at 134.53 yen.
   The dollar's slip followed a remark by a U.S. government
official expressing concern over the currency's further rise, said
the trader who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Charles Dallara, the U.S. Treasury's assistant
secretary-designate for international affairs, told a Senate panel
Tuesday the U.S. government continues to stand by an accord on the
dollar reached by the seven major industrialized countries known as
the Group of Seven.
   That accord, reached in Washington in April, called further
rises in the dollar ``counterproductive.''
   On the stock market, a Nomura Securities' analyst said trading
was directionless, while participants were still concerned with the
yen's performance against the dollar.
   ``Investors didn't have a specific incentive to purchase, so
they just made adjustments by buying issues when prices fell and
selling as they rose,'' he said.

<HEAD>Dad Charged With Killing Sons in Foundry Believed End of World Was
Near, Psychiatrist Says</HEAD>

   A man charged with killing his two sons
in a 1,300-degree foundry ladle believed he was ``doing his
children a favor'' because the end of the world was near, a
psychologist testified.
   Dr. Harley Stock, deputy director of the state's Center for
Forensic Psychiatry, testified Tuesday that Bartley Dobben was
insane when he killed his children on Thanksgiving Day 1987.
   ``In terms of society's rules, he knew it was wrong,'' Stock
said. ``But he was operating under the rules of God ... God had
dictated through the Bible'' that he kill the children.
   About a week and a half before the slayings at the
Cannon-Muskegon Corp. foundry where Dobben worked, one of the
children told his mother that Dobben tried to drown him and his
brother in their bathtub, Stock said in an interview Tuesday.
   However, Dobben told Stock he was baptizing his sons, aged 2
years and 15 months, because he believed the end of the world was
near, Stock said.
   ``Religion was on his mind all the time,'' Stock said, adding
that he agreed with a 1985 diagnosis that found Dobben to be
suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. ``The flames of his mental
illness were fanned by his religion.
   ``He believed he was doing his children a favor by killing
them,'' Stock testified. ``He told us he decided the children had
to die by his hands because they were going to die anyway.''
   Dobben believed his children would come back to life because
they were pure, Stock testified.
   After putting the children in the ladle used to hold molten
metal, Dobben ``played with them, made them comfortable, put the
lid on, lit it and felt all right about it,'' Stock said. The boys
quickly perished in the furnace.
   Dobben took what he read in the Bible literally and when he read
about the end of the world, he believed ``it was going to happen
now and he was going to take action,'' Stock said.
   Dobben's family testified his mental illness seemed to worsen
after Dobben met Rood Vaughan, a self-ordained fundamentalist
minister.
   The prosecution was to call a witness Thursday to show Dobben
was sane at the time of the slayings.

   Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of
seeing his self-portrait sell for $47.85 million to become the
second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said.
   ``Yo Picasso,'' painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was
last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   Its price Tuesday night at Sotheby's was more than twice its
pre-sale estimate and was second only to Vincent Van Gogh's
``Irises,'' which sold for $53.9 million in 1987.
   The Picasso was one of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Modern works that sold for a record total of $204.82 million. The
previous mark for one auction was $117 million at Sotheby's in
London in April.
   The previous record sale for Picasso, who died in 1973, was
$38.45 million paid last year for ``Acrobate et Jeune Arlequin.''
   Paloma Picasso, who attended Tuesday's sale, said she thought
her father ``would get a kick out of it'' if he knew how much his
self-portrait had brought.
   ``It's in another stratosphere, but it's because there's a lot
of cash around,'' she said. ``It's better that these people use
their money for these paintings rather than planes and bombs.''
   Two bidders made their offers by telephone, upping one another
in increments of a million dollars once the price war got past $30
million. The standing-room-only audience oohed as each offer was
announced and applauded the winning figure.
   Neither bidder was identified. The loser also was the
underbidder when the painting was last sold.
   ``Yo Picasso'' was sold by Wendell Cherry of Louisville, Ky.,
who heads Humana Inc., the hospital management corporation.
   Records were set Tuesday for 11 artists besides Picasso.
   Paul Gauguin's ``Mata Mua (In Olden Times),'' a colorful
Tahitian landscape, sold for $24.2 million. That broke a record set
last month when Gauguin's ``The Fare Hymenee'' sold for $10.36
million.
   A record $11.55 million for Paul Cezanne was set by his 1893-94
still life ``Pichet et Fruits sur une Table.'' In 1988, his ``La
Cote du Galet, A Pontoise'' sold for $9.24 million.
   An abstract landscape by Wassily Kandinsky,
``Herbstlandschaft,'' sold for $3.96 million, a record for the
Russian-born artist whose next highest-priced work,
``Murnau-Landschaft Mit Kirsche 1,'' brought $2.4 million in 1987.
   The Gauguin, Cezanne and six other Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist works sold Tuesday were from the collection of
Jaimie Ortiz-Patino, heir to a Bolivian tin fortune.
   All prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.
   Sotheby's and Christie's, two of the largest auction houses in
the world, hope to ring up $572 million from 4,472 art works over
12 days of sales that began May 2.
   ``What do we do for an encore?'' asked Sotheby's auctioneer John
Marion.
   Then he answered his own question when he noted that the art
collection of the heir to the Campbell Soup Co. fortune, John
Dorrance, who died April 9, will be sold at Sotheby's in October.
   The multi-million dollar collection includes Impressionist and
Post-Impressionist paintings, as well as French 18th-century
furniture and porcelain.

<TEXT>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index declined
today, and the dollar fell from an eight-month high against the yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 39.52
points, or 0.12 percent, following a 103.37-point decline on
Tuesday, and closed at 33,992.35.
   Dealers said the index declined as foreign investors sold
shares. Also, they said, others held back from buying after remarks
by Bank of Japan Gov. Satoshi Sumita seen as indicating possible
interest rate increases, which usually discourage stock buying.
   Sumita told an upper house Budget Committee session today that
the central bank will ``take necessary measures whenever
necessary'' on interest rates to deter inflationary pressure.
   Market participants believe the Bank of Japan is likely to raise
its key rate by at least 0.5 percentage points in late May to ease
upward pressure on prices.
   Kazuhiro Nomura of New Japan Securities Co. said the stock
market showed little positive reaction to the yen's recovery
against the dollar today.
   The dollar closed at 134.44 yen, down 0.56 yen from Tuesday's
close. It opened at 134.42 yen and ranged between 134.15 yen and
134.53 yen.
   The dollar's 135.00 yen closing Tuesday was its highest since
135.60 yen last Sept. 6.
   ``Although the yen recovered from yesterday's 135-yen level,
stock players took it as rather neutral, and it didn't encourage
them much,'' Nomura said.
   He said foreign investors selling spot issues to buy cheaper
futures issues also contributed to the Nikkei's fall.
   Trading was moderate, with first section volume estimated at 900
million shares, down from Tuesday's 1 billion.
   Masafumi Koyama of the Bank of Tokyo said today's currency
trading was mixed, with traders buying and selling dollars.
   ``But that doesn't mean the dollar's recent uptrend was totally
reversed,'' he said.
   He said a large demand for the dollar remains, ``considering
that Japanese investors have been buying the dollar without
specific economic reasons.''

   With potent symbols, familiar faces and
even a lesson on how to vote, Solidarity's first 45-minute show was
broadcast on government television under an accord giving it
limited access to the mass media.
   At 10:45 p.m. Tuesday, the words ``Studio Solidarnosc'' popped
up on the screen followed by the red-and-white national flag and
then another Solidarity sign with the well-known union logo.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa joked, ``I don't know what I came
here for,'' as he walked into the studio filled with union banners.
   ``Because this is the first historic entrance of Solidarity.
It's not that they (the state-run TV) only speak about Solidarity,
it's simply for the first time that we are given a chance to
speak,'' answered the host.
   Walesa immediately launched into an appeal for support of
partially free elections June 4 to the Sejm, or lower house, and
the Senate.
   ``We have been waiting for very long for the moment when Poles _
in a limited way _ will be able to speak about the country's
problems, to take part in deciding about the fate of this
country,'' he said.
   Round-table agreements reached April 5 reinstated Solidarity
after a seven-year ban and allowed the opposition to run for 161
seats of the 460-member Sejm and for the new 100-member Senate.
   The agreements also guarantee the opposition access to mass
media.
   The Solidarity television program will be broadcast once a week
for 45 minutes on Tuesday nights at either 10 or 10:45 p.m.
   Also, as of today, Solidarity will have a portion of half-hour
official ``election studio'' broadcasts every evening until the
vote. Regional nightly news programs will also have short section
of Solidarity information.
   A half-hour weekly show on government-controlled radio had its
first broadcast on April 28, and the opposition published the first
issue of a mass-circulation daily newspaper on Monday.
   All the opposition broadcasts and publications are subject to
the same censorship as government media.
   Walesa dominated the first half of the broadcast.
   He was shown laying flowers at a monument in Gdansk to workers
killed in price riots on the Baltic coast in 1970, then greeting
Solidarity's candidates to the Sejm and Senate at a meeting April
29 at the Gdansk shipyard where the independent union was born in
1980.
   The program showed interviews with pro-Solidarity students,
campaign workers collecting signatures needed to put candidates on
the ballot for the June vote, and then a series of people saying
why they would vote.
   Solidarity national spokesman Janusz Onyszkiewicz urged voters
to make sure they learn and remember the names of the candidates
backed by Solidarity, since the ballots will list only their names
and not affiliations.
   He told people not to worry about the authorities' list of
candidates since in that part, the elections are not free.
   Once the round-table talks began in February, government
television began showing short bits of his news conferences,
meetings and rallies with extensive coverage of Walesa's trip to
Rome in April to meet with Pope John Paul II.

<HEAD>Labor Party Abandons Unilateral Nuclear Disarmament Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL WEST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition Labor Party's leadership, in a move
to broaden public support after a decade out of power, has
abandoned the party's unpopular policy of unilateral nuclear
disarmament.
   At the urging of party leader Neil Kinnock, Labor's National
Executive committee voted 17-8 on Tuesday for a policy under which
a Labor-led government would only scrap Britain's independent
nuclear arsenal as part of a negotiated arms control deal.
   Hard-line leftists accused Labor of betraying its principles.
   But Kinnock, once an ardent unilateralist, said the doctrine had
not won the support of like-minded politicians in other countries,
including the United States, France and the Soviet Union.
   ``Unilateralism is not even comprehended by those who share our
objectives in other countries,'' he said.
   ``They were totally uncomprehending that we should want to get
rid of a nuclear system without getting elimination of nuclear
weapons on other sides too _ without getting anything for it in
return,'' he said.
   The executive committee also voted 16-9 to defeat a motion by
hard-line leftists to set a deadline for unilaterally scrapping
Britain's submarine-borne nuclear missiles.
   The committee adopted an unopposed amendment that says a Labor
government would negotiate nuclear disarmament with the Soviet
Union if U.S.-Soviet negotiations stalled.
   Labor embraced unilateralism in 1981 and the policy has been
cited as a key reason for its two subsequent defeats by the
Conservatives under Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who believes
nuclear deterrence alone can maintain world peace.
   Kinnock and other party chiefs are trying to kill a widespread
perception that Labor is dominated by doctrinaire left-wingers, and
draw the party back to the political center.
   Labor currently holds 226 of the 650 seats in the
Conservative-dominated House of Commons.
   ``Out of power, we do not have the opportunities of unilateral
or any other sort of disarmament,'' Kinnock said. ``We only have
the chance to talk about it. In power we can act and make dramatic
progress.''
   Leftist hard-liners said they would fight to restore the
unilateralism doctrine at Labor's annual convention in October. The
convention must approve all policy changes.
   The executive committee also adopted unopposed a resolution
saying nuclear weapons are ``not a deterrent and of no practical
use.''
   Answering questions in Parliament Tuesday, Mrs. Thatcher said
she expected the outcome within Labor to be ``unilateralism in a
different wrapping.''
   Defense Secretary George Younger said: ``To arm yourself with a
deterrent, which you then say you will not use, would be about as
effective as a feather duster.''
   Labor's foreign affairs chief, Gerald Kaufman, said the new
policy is in line with most of Britain's NATO partners.
   Thatcher became prime minister in May 1979 after a victory in
parliamentary elections that forced out Labor's James Callaghan.

   High school boys have an unfair edge over girls
in winning lucrative National Merit Scholarships, a new report
claims.
   Nearly 63 percent of the 15,000 semifinalists competing for this
year's 6,000 merit scholarships are boys, said the report by
FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass.-based research group critical of
standardized tests.
   The report said more scholarships go to boys because the
National Merit Scholarship Corporation, of Evanston, Ill., uses the
standardized Preliminary Scholastic Aptitude Test as the sole
criterion for determining semifinalists.
   The non-profit corporation distributes some $24 million in
scholarships a year, ranging from $500 to $8,000 each.
   Critics, including FairTest, contend that the PSAT, a multiple
choice exam similar to the Scholastic Aptitude Test, is biased
against females.
   Thirty-one percent of this year's semifinalists are girls,
according to the state-by-state analysis that examined the first
names of winners. The genders of the remaining 6 percent couldn't
be determined from their names.
   In previous surveys, FairTest found 60.1 percent of merit
scholars were boys in 1987-88, and 61 percent were males in 1986-87.
   Marianne Roderick, the scholarship corporation's executive vice
president, termed the report misleading and challenged the bias
charge. She said that while the PSAT is used to determine
semifinalists, actual scholarship winners are chosen on their
academic record, leadership potential and other personal qualities.
   ``In 34 years, we have never based our scholarship decisions
solely on a test,'' she said.
   The College Board sponsors the PSAT, taken annually by more than
1 million students, mostly high school juniors. The Educational
Testing Service administers the exam.
   Test critics claimed a victory in Februarywhen a federal judge
ruled that New York state scholarship programs discriminated
against women because winners were selected solely on the basis of
SAT scores.
   ``There's no excuse for National Merit's continued reliance on a
biased test when a federal court has ruled that using similar exams
to select scholarship winners constitutes sex discrimination,''
said Cinthia Schuman, FairTest's executive director.
   She said it was too soon to confirm FairTest's figures for 1989
since scholarship winners won't be announced until later this month.
   In the ``Achievement Program'' aimed at awarding 700 merit
scholarships to black students, women outnumbered male winners by
58-42 percent, said Roderick. That competition requires information
about high school coursework, leadership qualities and other
criteria.
   The dispute over whether standardized tests like the SAT and
PSAT are biased against female students has heated up lately.
   Following the New York State court victory by the American Civil
Liberties Union, a report last month by the Center for Women Policy
Studies identified 23 test questions used in a 1987 SAT exam in
which one sex outperformed the other by at least 10 percent. In all
but two of those questions, boys bested girls.
   The College Board and ETS have issued repeated statements lately
denying the charge of test bias. The testmakers contend that women
are less likely than men to take advanced math, science and other
college prep courses in high school.

<HEAD>Violence Flares Again Between Armenians and Azerbaijanis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Renewed ethnic violence and more strikes have been
reported in the disputed southern region of Nagorno-Karabakh,
prompting authorities to tighten security in the Armenian enclave
inside Soviet Azerbaijan.
   At least seven people have been injured since Friday in violence
that shattered a four-month calm, Tass reported Tuesday.
   The official news agency seemed to leave open the possibility of
more unrest, saying the situation remained ``tense and complex''
and that calls were growing louder for an extended general strike
and civil disobedience campaign.
   Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh said by telephone
Saturday that they had started new strikes.
   Military and civilian officials increased surveillance on roads,
lengthened a curfew and posted soldiers between Armenian and
Azerbaijani neighborhoods, Tass reported.
   ``When the lives of children, women and old men are in danger,
the government cannot stand by. This is the all-important task
now,'' said Arkady I. Volsky, head of a committee created by Moscow
to administer Nagorno-Karabakh, quoted by Tass.
   Three-fourths of Nagorno-Karabakh's 162,000 people are ethnic
Armenians, most of whom are Christian, but it is an enclave in
predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan, to which it was assigned in 1923.
   Demonstrations for annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh began in
Armenia in February 1988 and trouble resulted in both of the
neighboring republics that border Iran.
   More than 90 people were killed in Armenia and Azerbaijan last
year in ethnic strife. In January, the Kremlin put Nagorno-Karabakh
under Moscow's direct control in an attempt to halt the bloodshed.
   The Tass report Tuesday said many ethnic Armenian residents
distrust Volsky's committee and still want an end to
Nagorno-Karabakh's association with Azerbaijan. It said the case
was stated in an open letter to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev from
the region's Communist Party and government leaders, printed in the
official newspaper Sovietsky Karabakh.
   Tass gave this account of the violence:
   Soldiers and police fired into the air Friday to disperse a huge
brawl in Kirkidzhan village outside Stepanakert, the territorial
capital, that began when three Armenians attacked Azerbaijanis.
   Three civilians and four soldiers were injured when authorities
intervened to restore order, and four cars and a motorcycle were
damaged.
   On Saturday, rocks thrown from a car smashed windows of a bus
traveling from Armenia's capital, Yerevan, to Martuni in
northeastern Nagorno-Karabakh. The Azerbaijani driving the car and
two passengers were charged with hooliganism.
   Stones were thrown at other buses or cars entering
Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenia or Azerbaijan.
   The news agency said strikes had immobilized industries,
construction sites and some government offices.
   ``Workers and employees of Azerbaijani nationality are not being
allowed to work in industries and offices in Stepanakert, and
Armenians are afraid to go to work'' in Shushe, a predominantly
Azerbaijani town, Tass said.
   Armenian activist Rafael Popoyan said by telephone from Yerevan
last week that the strikes were caused in part by reports that
Volsky had ordered the settling of more Azerbaijanis in
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   Valery A. Sidorov, a government official in Nagorno-Karabakh,
said in a telephone interview Saturday that there had been no
influx of Azerbaijanis, and Armenians who had fled were returning.
   Tass said 20 percent of Stepanakert's residents and 10 percent
of the entire region's population had fled since the trouble began.

   A cab driver was in critical condition today
after doctors surgically removed more than $71,000 worth of heroin
from his body that he apparently swallowed before leaving his
native Nigeria.
   Doctors at Weiss Memorial Hospital on Tuesday removed 49 packets
of heroin from the stomach and intestines of Kayode Olujare, said
Sgt. John Hickey of the Chicago Police Department.
   Olujare had passed another 32 packets through his bowels since
he was hospitalized May 1, Hickey said.
   A total of about 550 grams of heroin have been recovered, and
doctors believe more than a dozen packets are still inside Olujare,
Hickey said. Police believe he ingested the packets in Nigeria, he
said.
   ``The packets are the size of half your thumb. They're plastic
and covered with electrical tape,'' said Hickey.
   ``We're listing the value of the heroin at $71,175. But on the
street you're getting stuff that's maybe 10 percent pure. This
stuff is said to be more than 90 percent pure.''
   Olujare was listed in critical condition early this morning,
hospital spokeswoman Henrini Cooper said.
   The 33-year-old cabbie was charged with possession of a
controlled substance and scheduled for a court hearing June 2,
pending his recovery, Hickey said.
   Olujare became sick after returning to Chicago April 30 from a
visit to Lagos, Nigeria, Hickey said.
   ``Doctors suspected drug poisoning and X-rays confirmed it,'' he
said. ``Some of the packets opened and he got pure heroin into his
system.''
   The X-rays were ``incredible. He looked like a pinball
machine,'' Hickey said.
   Police have kept a 24-hour watch at Olujare's bedside and a
patrolman was in the operating room during the surgery, Hickey said.

<BYLINE>Alzheimer Patients With Depression Show Slower Behavioral Decline
In Study ^By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Alzheimer's disease patients with
depression showed slower decline in some behavioral measures than
other patients did in a new study, a finding researchers say was a
surprise.
   It may mean that depression signals a form of Alzheimer's that
follows a more benign behavioral course, said study co-author
Blaine Greenwald.
   In any case, the study is preliminary and more research must be
done, he said.
   Greenwald is from Hillside Hospital, part of Long Island Jewish
Medical Center in Glen Oaks, N.Y. He did the work at the Mount
Sinai Medical Center in New York with colleagues from there and the
Bronx Veterans Administration Hospital.
   Alzheimer's disease is a progressive brain disorder that affects
an estimated 2.5 million Americans and causes some 150,000 deaths a
year. Symptoms include gradual memory loss, impairment of judgment,
disorientation, personality change, difficulty in learning and loss
of language. No cause or cure is known.
   The study focused on 64 Alzheimer's patients whose conditions
were assessed at six-month intervals for up to three years.
Patients were not treated for depression.
   Higher levels of depression in the initial assessment were
linked to slower decline on behavioral measures. The measures cover
such aspects as delusions and hallucinations, agitation and
restlessness and appetite disturbances.
   But depression made no difference in the disease's impact on
such measures as naming objects, knowing the date, ability to
follow commands and memory for spoken words.
   Greenwald said some studies suggest that Alzheimer's patients
with depression have an underlying abnormality in certain brain
cells, in contrast to non-depressed patients. That supports the
idea that depression identifies a particular form of the disease,
he said.
   A previous study also suggested that patients with depression
tended to have better behavioral ratings, but still another study
found no difference, he said.

<TEXT>
   Opponents of a plan to replace the nation's fifth
busiest airport are pulling out all the stops with just one week
before voters decide the issue.
   A Rocky Mountain News poll published Sunday showed support to
replace Stapleton International Airport remains 2-to-1 among Denver
voters.
   Business owners who would suffer economically if Denver's
airport is moved have formed a group called Save Our Stapleton and
have hired high-priced political consultant Roger Ailes.
   Ailes' television ads for George Bush in last fall's
presidential election made Michael Dukakis look unsoldierly while
riding in a tank. His first ad for the Save Our Stapleton group
depicted Mayor Federico Pena looking awkward in a construction hard
hat as an unseen announcer warns that ``developers'' and
``politicians'' are trying to sell Denver a bad project.
   Denver wants to build the first major new airport in the United
States since 1974, when the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport
was built.
   Stapleton was built in 1929 in northeast Denver.
   ``It's patchwork and glue, baling wire and chewing gum,''
Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware said. ``Everything has been
added on since. We even have some of the original control tower
from 1929 in the sub-basement.''
   Opponents say a new airport is unneeded. They cite figures
showing passenger traffic at Stapleton has declined during the past
two years and say Stapleton can be expanded.
   The airport has become more than just a local and statewide
issue.
   The Federal Aviation Administration would like to see new
airports built in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles.
   New airports have become so expensive that aviation analysts
predict only one or two will be built before the end of the
century. Cost estimates of the new Denver airport range from $1.7
billion to $2.3 billion.
   Where the money ultimately would come from to build an airport
has been at the heart of debate.
   A federal judge ruled Monday that Denver may not increase
landing fees or use airline money to pay for the proposed new
airport, but said the city could use concessions fees.
   The two main airlines at Stapleton, United and Continental,
responded to the ruling by saying the city should refund at least
$8 million paid toward the proposed new airport between 1985 and
1986.
   Concessions funds amount to about $30 million a year. Officials
estimate increased landing fees would have brought in an additional
$10 million annually.
   ``People all over the country are looking at Denver to see what
will happen,'' said Bill Kenyon, a spokesman for a pro-airport
group's Let's Vote Yes campaign.
   ``The ad the opposition has put on the air is offensive to this
community,'' said John Frew, who is directing campaign. ``They have
lobbed a sizable hand grenade at us.''
   He said Stapleton has gotten a bad reputation for delays and has
limited capacity to expand.
   Several years ago, Western Airlines, whose hub is in Salt Lake
City, ran an advertising campaign that said, ``Fly with us and
never fly through Stapleton again.''
   Even opponents acknowledge some of the remarks are justified.
   Stapleton has limited capacity to handle jumbo jets. Those
planes are put into what pilots call the ``penalty box'' while
waiting for an access ramp, and delays can last from 20 minutes to
an hour.
   When it snows, the number of operating runways sometimes is cut
from four to one, snarling air traffic across the United States.
   The new airport would be located 17 miles from Stapleton, on the
northeast edge of metropolitan Denver and east of the Rocky
Mountain Arsenal.
   Last year, voters in neighboring Adams County worried that
Denver was trying to ram the project through by annexing their land.
   However, when the issue of whether Denver should be allowed to
annex the land went to a vote, it passed, 55 percent to 45 percent.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gunmen stormed Beirut's central jail
early today and freed 189 convicts as Christians and Syrians
battled with tanks across the city's dividing Green Line.
   Police said a special squad of officers armed with M-16 assault
rifles recaptured 90 convicts in a sweep of Moslem west Beirut.
   Seven people were killed and 47 wounded during the night, mostly
by tank fire, said a police spokesman, who cannot be named under
standing rules.
   That raised the overall casualty toll to 334 people killed and
1,281 wounded since fighting broke out on March 8 between Gen.
Michel Aoun's Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and
Druse forces.
   An Arab League envoy held talks today in Damascus, the Syrian
capital, in an effort to revive a cease-fire called by the
organization on April 28.
   Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, keeps 40,000 troops
across 70 percent of the country under a 1976 Arab League
peacekeeping mandate.
   The police spokesman said about 30 unidentified gunmen, armed
with Soviet-designed grenade launchers and AK-47 automatic rifles,
broke into the jail in a Moslem district at 2:20 a.m.
   He said a Moslem police sergeant was killed in a shootout with
the gunmen, who ``entered the prison warden's office, took the
keys, opened the cells and turned loose all 189 prisoners.''
   The tank clashes near the Green Line escalated into shelling of
Christian and Moslem residential districts at about midnight
Tuesday, the police spokesman said.
   Tanks deployed between apartment buildings drew howitzer and
anti-armor fire, but most shells missed them and blasted the
buildings.
   ``Both sides were using the population as their shield,'' the
spokesman said.
   Ambulance sirens and thuds from exploding shells echoed across
the city until the fighting slackened into occasional exchanges of
howitzer shells about 3:15 a.m., he said.
   The Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Ibrahimi of Algeria, was
accompanied by Gen. Ali Al-Momen, a Kuwaiti officer chosen to head
a 321-man observer force drawn from six Arab nations to help
implement a lasting cease-fire.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, said
Tuesday that the Arab military observers would not arrive until a
cease-fire takes hold.
   ``It has become difficult in light of the recent developments to
send the observer force to Lebanon to expose their lives to danger
either by assassination or killing as a result of the
indiscriminate shelling,'' Al-Sabah told reporters in Kuwait.
   Aoun, who also heads a Christian military cabinet, and acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, his Sunni Moslem rival, both said they
accepted the truce.
   But Syrian forces and their allies from Druse warlord Walid
Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party militia continued to shell
the Christian enclave north of Beirut. They said they were trying
to prevent three ships loaded with Iraqi weapons and ammunition
from re-supplying Aoun's forces.
   Iraq, which has a long-running feud with Syria, backs Aoun's
pledge to fight until Syrian troops are withdrawn from Lebanon.
   The current round of fighting in Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war
began two days after Aoun's navy blockaded three ports controlled
by Syrian-backed militias south of Beirut in a bid to recoup lost
tax revenues estimated at $100 million annually.
   Jumblatt's militia retaliated by shelling the 310-square mile
Christian heartland, the Syrians joined in later.

<TEXT>
   President Hosni Mubarak's government has engaged
in a persistent pattern of torture, whipping, sexually abusing and
hanging political prisoners by their wrists, Amnesty International
charged today.
   Evidence of torture comes from interviews with victims detained
from 1986 to 1988 and more than 100 medical reports by the Egyptian
Justice Ministry's forensic medicine department, a spokeswoman for
the human rights group said.
   At least 3,000 political opponents, many of them members of
Islamic groups, have been arrested arbitrarily under state of
emergency laws since 1986, Amnesty spokeswoman Carline Windall
said. Many were held incommunicado for weeks or months before being
formally charged, she said.
   Egypt's Interior Ministry today denied that the country has any
political prisoners and said it was ``absolutely untrue that there
is torture of any kind.''
   The ministry in a statement said, ``Government prosecutors and
the courts are in charge of detainees and investigate any
complaints the detainees have. ... Until now, there has been no
proof that any torture exists.''
   The London-based group said in its 40-page report, ``The torture
testimony has been consistent and prompts the conclusion that there
is a pattern of torture in Egypt and that there are insufficient
safeguards to protect detainees from torture.''
   Emergency laws allow virtually indefinite detention without
charge. Egypt has been under an almost continuous state of
emergency since 1967.
   Mubarak came to power on Oct. 6, 1981 after Moslem
fundamentalists assassinated President Anwar Sadat.
   Amnesty's report said torture usually occurs during the first
days of detention. It cited the case of a 22-year-old student,
Mahmoud Agami Mehelhil, who was arrested in February 1987, held
incommunicado for 37 days, and allegedly stripped, blindfolded and
whipped all over his body.
   The report says Mehelhil still bears the physical marks of
torture and believes he was released from Mazra'at Tora Prison
south of Cairo without trial so that the court would not see his
injuries.
   The document also cites reports by Moslem activists of beatings
with cables and whips, burnings with cigarettes, and other forms of
torture.
   It said many torture victims were among the thousands of
political suspects arrested after the attempted assassinations in
May and August 1987 of former Interior Ministers Maj. Gen. Hassan
Abu Basha and Maj. Gen. Nabawi Ismail and of magazine editor Makram
Muhammed Ahmed.
   The report said at least 1,500 Moslems were detained across the
country after a demonstration in a mosque in the southern city of
Fayoum on April 7.
   Fundamentalist Moslems are demanding enactment of Sharia,
Islam's legal and social code with harsh criminal penalties like
limb amputation and flogging.
   The government contends 90 percent of Egyptian laws already
conform to Sharia, but they do not include the Islamic code's
corporal punishments.
   Amnesty's report called on the Egyptian government to provide
political detainees access to lawyers, relatives and doctors.
   Egypt was among the first six countries in 1986 to sign a U.N.
convention against torture.

   Allegations that Koch Industries cheated
Indian tribes out of millions of dollars in oil royalties may be
just the latest round in a long-running Koch family feud.
   William Koch, the younger brother of Koch Industries Chairman
Charles Koch, hired an investigator to monitor the company's oil
measuring practices.
   Investigator Chris Tucker testified Tuesday before the Senate
Select Committee on Indian Affairs that Koch Industries was
stealing oil by deliberately mismeasuring it.
   The committee is investigating theft of oil from and
underpayment of oil royalties to Indians.
   A Koch spokesman said mismeasurements are common and that the
company's errors were well within the range commonly found in the
industry.
   Wichita-based Koch Industries has interests in energy, real
estate, manufacturing and cattle. It is one of the nation's largest
privately held corporations with annual revenues estimated at $16
billion to $18 billion.
   William Koch has made several attempts to wrest control of the
company from Charles and has filed several lawsuits against his
brother, the company and other family members.
   Charles Koch, 52, of Wichita, and his brother, David, 47, an
executive vice president who heads the company's chemical
operations from New York City, are billionaires, according to
Forbes magazine.
   William Koch, David's twin, has a fortune estimated at $600
million and heads a suburban Boston energy company, Oxbow Corp.
   Eldest brother Frederick, 53, who has residences in Monaco and
New York City and shares in company profits through a trust fund
despite being disinherited by his father, is worth an estimated
$450 million.
   The differences that led William and Frederick to become allies
against Charles and David never have been discussed publicly.
   ``There is a lot of deep hatred involved here,'' Don Cordes,
Koch Industries vice president for legal and corporate affairs and
a close friend of Charles Koch, once said.
   William Koch has denied he is pursuing a personal vendetta. He
once characterized his disagreements with Charles and David as
business disputes and said he has ``a great deal of respect'' for
his brothers.
   The brothers' mother, Mary, 81, said Charles always appeared
destined to follow in the footsteps of his father, Fred C. Koch,
who founded the company as Rock Island Oil and Refining Co.
   Charles became chairman after his father died in 1967. He turned
the company into a thriving, diversified conglomerate at a time
when other independent oil companies were faltering. The number of
employees has grown from 650 to more than 7,000.
   In 1980, William Koch led dissident stockholders in an
unsuccessful attempt to wrest control from Charles. William Koch
was fired as an executive of the company in December 1980.
   In a 1982 lawsuit, William Koch sought control of the company
and accused Charles Koch and others of misappropriating funds. The
lawsuit was settled out of court in June 1983 when Koch Industries
bought the stakes owned by William, Frederick and other dissidents
for an estimated $1.5 billion.
   Since then, William Koch has filed two unsuccessful lawsuits
claiming the settlement undervalued company assets.
   William and Frederick also are suing their brothers and mother,
claiming they have been cut out of decisions on what non-profit
groups get donations from the Koch Foundation, which distributes
about $300,000 a year.
   A Sedgwick County District Court judge will hear closing
arguments in two weeks.

   A 50-foot landing craft involved in the
Prince William Sound oil spill cleanup sank in Valdez Arm. The
three people aboard were rescued uninjured, the Coast Guard said.
   The Hummer, based in Seward, went down quickly Tuesday night 4
miles west of Galena Bay, spokesman Dave Haulbrook said. He said
the three crew members were able to board a life raft, and were
picked up by a passing tugboat.
   Haulbrook said the crew members were taken to the Alyeska marine
tanker terminal in Valdez. The Coast Guard's Marine Safety Office
is investigating the accident, Haulbrook said.
   The Hummer was under contract to Exxon to help clean up the
nation's worst oil spill. It was one of more than 600 vessels
working for Exxon on the spill.
   A spokeswoman at Exxon's 24-hour command post in Valdez said
early today she had no information on the accident, and didn't know
who did.
   But Exxon sources said the vessel went down so quickly the
crewmen only had time to radio a distress call and abandon ship.
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity, saying they feared
they would be fired if they were identified because only designated
spokesmen are permitted to speak with reporters.
   They said the landing craft was being used to shuttle supplies
from Valdez to support ships around the sound.
   The Hummer was en route to Green Island with a load of absorbent
material, pumps and tools, they said.
   The boat recently had work done on its hull, they said.
   It was the second serious accident during the seven-week cleanup
effort. Last week, two men escaped injury when their helicopter
crashed near Anchorage while on a flight to ferry workers to Valdez.
   Bill Rainey, Exxon's operation manager, said Monday the most
serious injury to date has been a broken ankle sustained by a woman
who fell on an oily beach.

   The dollar fell in early European trading today
and gold prices rose.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was waiting for signs
of central bank intervention or statements by senior officials that
could shed light on the currency's near-term course.
   ``The general trend remains bullish (for the dollar),'' said one
trader in Rome. ``This is just a moment of reflection.''
   Traders said the dollar remains supported by relatively high
U.S. interest rates, the perception the rates may continue to rise
and by political problems in West Germany and Japan.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day
begins, the dollar fell 0.56 yen to a closing 134.44. Later, in
London, it was quoted at 134.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday:
   _ 1.9072 West German marks, down from 1.9158
   _ 1.6895 Swiss francs, down from 1.7035
   _ 6.4435 French francs, down from 6.4645
   _ 2.1535 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1610
   _ 1,390.80 Italian lire, down from 1,397.125
   _ 1.1845 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1869
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6690, more expensive for
buyers than $1.6605 Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $378.00 a troy ounce, up
from $376.50 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $378.10.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $378.25, up from $376.40 bid late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.87 to close at a bid $378.94.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.67 a troy
ounce, up from Tuesday's $5.63.

<HEAD>New York Says Subway System is Free of Graffiti</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The city's subway trains have been declared
grafitti free, ending an era of guerrilla artists who turned the
cars into rolling canvasses of cryptic messages, often-poignant art
and downright threatening messages.
   ``When you're sitting in a graffiti-covered car, you don't feel
safe,'' said Transit Authority President David L. Gunn.
   ``There was a sense that the system was out of control.''
   The Transit Authority planned a celebration Friday in which it
will send what it describes as its last graffiti-covered train on a
final journey.
   The agency began cleaning its 6,245-car fleet in 1984, and
figures show the number of graffiti attacks has declined since then.
   Critics say eliminating graffiti may make it more pleasant to
ride the subway but does little to improve service, increase safety
or decrease crime within the system.
   The Transit Authority has a $52 million annual budget for
cleaning cars.
   Workers wipe the graffiti with a glycol ether-based cleanser and
then rinse it away.
   In the beginning, transit officials ordered cars taken out of
service within 24 hours of being marked by graffiti. Then it became
easier to keep the cars clean as more clean cars were put back in
service, Gunn said.
   ``I appreciate not having to get on a fun house of colors in the
morning,'' said Gene Russianoff, president of the Straphangers
Campaign, which lobbies on behalf of subway riders.
   ``But do riders care more that service is unreliable on most
lines? The answer is yes,'' he said. ``I think the Transit
Authority deserves a pat on the back and maybe a cigar, but I don't
think they deserve canonization.''

   Firefighters fought to control a fire aboard a
300-foot fish processing vessel on the Seattle waterfront early
today.
   The fire aboard the Golden Alaska was reported just before 11:30
p.m. Tuesday.
   Rosie Davis, nursing supervisor at Harborview Medical Center,
said that four people were treated for minor injuries.
   Coast Guard Petty Officer Frank Klucznik said fire crews had to
rescue one crew member who had been trapped.
   The fire started in the fish processing area, he said, and a
work crew was on board at the time. Some welding was under way, but
the cause of the fire remained unknown, he said.
   Klycznik said there was no danger of the ship sinking or causing
damage to nearby buildings.
   Fish processing vessels such as the Golden Alaska are used to
clean fish and store them after they are picked up from fishing
boats.

<HEAD>Man Regains Voice In Fall Through Door Glass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBERTVILLE, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who spent half his life
communicating by sign language and computer regained his voice
after he fell into a glass door.
   ``I feel wonderful,'' said a very hoarse Lynn Ray Collins, 33,
who was hospitalized and recovering from last week's fall.
   Dr. Raymond Ufford, Collin's doctor of several years, said he
does not know why the accident had such a dramatic effect. But he
said the loss of more than three pints of blood may be a factor.
   ``The only thing that points to some explanation is the
excessive loss of blood,'' Ufford said. ``That is a lot of blood to
lose and watching that happen, I think he realized he wants to live
so he is trying to speak.''
   Collins lost his voice in 1972 when he was struck by a car, an
accident that caused brain damage and left him in a coma for 11
weeks.
   Last Wednesday, his head struck the glass of a door at an
Albertville store. As blood flowed from the 9-inch cut, Collins
began trying to verbally answer paramedics' questions.
   Ufford said it still takes ``a great effort'' to understand
Collins. ``But he is trying very hard to articulate.''
   ``He's talking and pretty soon everyone will hear him. I praise
God,'' said his mother, Myrtice Collins. ``He just wants to talk
and talk and talk.''
   She said he previously would get depressed and refuse to
communicate at all, even with the computer or sign language.
   Medical personnel did not know Collins couldn't talk when he was
taken to the hospital on May 10.
   Mrs. Collins and her daughter arrived, heard Collins talk and
began yelling, crying, laughing and hugging.
   ``I guess the doctor must've thought we were crazy, laughing and
carrying on over someone with a hole knocked in their head,'' Mrs.
Collins said.
   ``I just can't believe it,'' she said. ``We thought we were
going to lose him after the first accident and now to have another
accident cure him. Someone out there must be looking out for us.''

<HEAD>More Charges Filed In Food And Drug Administration Corruption Case</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former official of the FDA's generic drugs
division has been charged with allegedly accepting a free trip to
Hong Kong and furniture as bribes from a New York state drug
manufacturer.
   Charles Y. Chang, a former branch chief in the Food and Drug
Adminstration's Division of Generic Drugs, was charged Tuesday in
U.S. District Court with two counts of interstate travel in aid of
racketeering. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years
in prison and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
   Chang is accused of taking bribes from American Therapeutics
Inc., a generic drug manufacturer, said U.S. Attorney Breckinridge
L. Willcox. The Bohemia, N.Y., drug manufacturer has not been
charged.
   Chang is the third person and the second FDA chemist to be
charged in the wide-ranging investigation of alleged bribery in the
generic drugs division.
   Chang accepted a free trip from his Potomac residence to Hong
Kong from the company in July 1987 and accepted chairs, lamps, beds
and other furniture from the company in September 1987, authorities
said.
   In late April, Chang was named but not charged in a criminal
information as the recipient of a $2,000 cash gratuity from an
executive of a Colorado-based generic drug company.
   The division is responsible for reviewing applications submitted
by pharmaceutical manufacturers seeking to market generic drugs.
Chang supervised chemists who reviewed the applications.
   The investigation, which began last summer, is being conducted
by the U.S. Attorney's office, the Inspector General of the U.S.
Health and Human Services Department, and the U.S. House Energy and
Commerce Committee.

<HEAD>Major Papers Give Prominent Coverage to Reporter Demands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN BIERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Major state newspapers today gave prominent
coverage of an appeal made by journalists for press freedom, and a
few offered unusually full accounts of reporters' complaints of
censorship.
   ``This action is unprecedented in the history of ... China's
media,'' Science and Technology Daily said of the anti-censorship
petition signed by more than 1,000 reporters and delivered to the
government Tuesday.
   Press freedom has been one of the main demands of the recent
student demonstrations, along with calls for greater democracy and
clean government.
   ``Generally speaking, I believe that today's reports (on the
journalists' appeal) weren't bad,'' said Li Datong, an editor at
the China Youth News who delivered the petition.
   Despite the coverage, the censor's work still was apparent. Some
articles noted the reporters' call for talks with Communist
officials but did not explain the grievances; other reports toned
down the petition's harshest wording.
   For example, the petition said that ``restrictions of every kind
have prevented full, objective and fair reporting'' on the student
protests. The official Xinhua News Agency and some newspapers
changed ``restrictions'' to ``reasons.''
   Science and Technology Daily, which gave a lengthy and
relatively objective account of the reporters' protest, noted the
petitioners complained that ``the press in the capital was tied up
in every manner in their reports on this major event.''
   The newspaper, in explaining the reporters' grievances, said:
``In fact, severe abuses exist in the current system of reporting
news in China.''
   At least two newspapers, the Economic Daily and the Legal Daily,
mentioned the petitioners' request to hold talks with party
propaganda officials on the firing of the editor of China's most
liberal paper after he rejected censor's demands.
   The Science and Technology Daily listed the names of 32 media
organizations, including itself, whose journalists were among those
who signed the petition.
   The official media initially maintained silence on the student
protests, which began on April 15 and brought tens of thousands of
people into the streets of the capital.
   Xinhua later issued brief, understated reports on the
demonstrations, while a few newspapers carried reports that made
the scope of the marches clear. Many reporters attended the marches
and handed in reports and photographs, but said their editors
decided not to use most of the material for fear it would fuel the
protests.
   Li said that while Beijing's newspapers have shown some openness
and flexibility in reporting the past few days, there are no
guarantees such trends will continue.
   ``China's press still lacks a feeling of safety,'' Li said in a
telephone interview, adding that a set of laws and regulations to
protect press freedom still was needed.

<BYLINE>Mayoral Elections in Nebraska and New Jersey; Referendum in S.C.
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Voters in Omaha, Neb., rejected a former mayor's bid to regain
the seat he lost in a recall election two years ago, while another
former mayor in Jersey City, N.J., advanced to a runoff in his bid
to win back the post.
   Also Tuesday, residents of Hilton Head Island, S.C., turned down
a measure that would have restricted growth at the golf-and-tennis
resort.
   In Nebraska, Omaha businessman P.J. Morgan ended former Mayor
Mike Boyle's comeback hopes. Boyle lost a recall election two years
ago amid allegations that he abused his executive power.
   With only absentee ballots remaining to be counted, Morgan had
56,774 votes or 53 percent, to Boyle's 48,115 votes, or 45 percent.
   Boyle, 45, said during the campaign that he was a recovering
alcoholic who had changed his controversial management style.
   ``I wouldn't have wanted to put my life on hold for another four
years,'' Boyle said.
   Morgan, 49, a millionaire real estate manager, outspent Boyle by
a margin of nearly 2-to-1, but Morgan said he didn't believe that
had been a factor.
   Election officials said voter turnout was about 50 percent.
   In Jersey City, former Mayor Gerald McCann and City Council
President Glenn Cunningham will face each other in a June 13 runoff
after besting eight other contenders.
   With all votes counted, unofficial returns showed McCann with
13,196 votes and Cunningham with 9,292 votes.
   McCann is hoping to recapture the job he lost in 1985 to
incumbent Anthony Cucci, who placed fourth in the balloting.
   Cunningham would become the city's first black mayor.
   ``The race that I see is the race for the mayor of Jersey
City,'' Cunningham said. ``That's the only race I'm concerned
with.''
   Voter turnout was 52 percent, compared to 67 percent in 1985.
   The mayor of Hilton Head Island said officials were relieved
that residents turned down a measure that would have restricted
growth by tying construction to how long motorists have to wait at
traffic lights.
   ``I think we can take a deep breath now that this is settled and
continue what we've been doing all along _ managing growth,'' Mayor
Marth Baumberger said after Tuesday's referendum.
   Town Clerk Tammy Malone said there were 6,369 votes, or 68
percent, against the measure and 2,995, or 32 percent, in favor.
   The measure would have frozen building permits if traffic, as
measured at any of several specified locations, slowed such that
drivers must wait more than two turns of a traffic light during the
peak of the tourist season in June.

<HEAD>Sheriff To Snare Drug Drivers With Bogus Highway Signs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELAND, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A sheriff has deployed a new weapon in his
drug-fighting arsenal: yellow diamond-shaped signs on Interstate 95
warning travelers of a ``Narcotics Inspection Ahead.''
   There is no inspection, but drivers who panic and illegally turn
around in the median will be stopped.
   Volusia County Sheriff Bob Vogel, whose unorthodox anti-drug
methods have caught national attention, says the public supports
his work.
   ``They applaud the efforts that law enforcement is making to
curtail this epidemic,'' he said Tuesday as he unveiled the signs.
   Defense attorneys and civil libertarians cried foul.
   ``You have to admit they're clever. But they're tricking people
into committing a crime,'' said Ron Ross, chairman of the Orlando
branch of the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Controversy isn't new to Vogel.
   He developed a drug suspect profile that produced an 80 percent
arrest rate on drug cases and was featured in a 1987 episode of
CBS' ``60 Minutes.'' Defense attorneys said he really was
arbitrarily stopping blacks wearing gold chains and driving large,
rented cars. Vogel denied any racial factor.
   State and federal appellate courts have ruled that officers can
use a profile to make an arrest only after stopping someone for a
traffic violation. The Florida Supreme Court is considering the
matter.
   Vogel has ordered deputies to continue stopping
suspicious-looking motorists since becoming sheriff of the North
Florida county in January. Since then, deputies have seized nearly
$300,000 in cash when there has not been enough evidence to make an
arrest.
   To defense attorneys and lawyers for the ACLU, the new highway
signs are just another high-handed, questionable tactic.
   ``It is a very drastic step toward a totalitarian form of
government,'' said Daytona Beach lawyer Dan Warren.
   ``To put up a sign that is meaningless is not a legitimate use
of police power,'' said Robyn Blumner, president of Florida's ACLU.
Checkpoints would be illegal anyway because cars are protected from
searches just like homes, she said.
   Vogel said 90 percent of the motorists stopped for traffic
violations and suspected of transporting drugs or having cash
tainted with drugs consent to having their cars searched.
   When a search turns up a large sum of cash but no drugs, a dog
is brought in to sniff the money. The cash is confiscated if traces
of narcotics are found. Motorists are entitled to a receipt for the
money, but often they just drive away, Vogel said.
   Warren said the use of dogs is questionable and cited a Miami
study that found traces of drugs on 20 percent of money tested in
bank vaults.
   But Vogel is undeterred.
   ``It's very uncommon for the average American I know of to be
transporting large sums of cash on the highways,'' he said. Vogel
is asking the courts to award money seized to the sheriff's
department to help finance his war on drugs.

<HEAD>Opposition Demands Resignation of Cabinet Because of Unrest</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY RENFREW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two main opposition parties today
called for the resignation of President Roh Tae-woo's Cabinet to
take responsibility for violent protests by students and workers.
   ``Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon's Cabinet is standing in the
way of democratization and is studded with all kinds of
mismanagement. It must resign immediately,'' Assemblyman Choi
Yung-kun said at the start of a special National Assembly session
to discuss the violence.
   The opposition Reunification Democratic Party and the Party for
Peace and Democracy did not call for Roh's resignation.
   But they charged that the government is blocking democratic
reform and using a crackdown on violent protests as a pretext to
move against all its opponents. They accused the government of
provoking unrest.
   The opposition-controlled Assembly can pass a resolution calling
on the Cabinet to resign, but the administration does not have to
accept such a call.
   Lawmakers of the governing Democratic Justice Party accused the
opposition of trying to block a crackdown on the violent dissidents
and weaken the Roh administration.
   A wave of violent protests and strikes has hit South Korea in
recent months, and many Koreans are calling for an end to the
unrest after six riot troopers were killed by students on May 3.
   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups have
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views. The radicals have been calling for the overthrow
of Roh and the creation of a leftist state ruled by workers and
farmers.
   The government has warned that efforts by radicals to build an
alliance with workers threatens political and economic stability.
   ``Leftist forces trying to overthrow our parliamentary democracy
and free democratic system will face stern punishment,'' Kang said
today. The prime minister said nothing about resigning.
   Roh warned after the riot trooper deaths that he would invoke
emergency powers if the violence does not end. Security forces have
been ordered to round up dissident leaders and block all protests.
   The government is trying to push a bill through the assembly
calling for tougher punishment for radicals who make or use
firebombs. The law would increase prison sentences for using
firebombs from three years to seven years.
   The opposition opposes the bill, contending the government must
limit police use of tear gas against protesters. Some opposition
leaders say riot police should only use tear gas with permission of
the prime minister or home minister, and must obtain it even when
battling rioters.
   Kim Dae-jung, leader of the Party for Peace and Democracy, said
today the government was using the crackdown as an excuse to limit
political freedom.
   He accused Roh of attempting to revive the authoritarian rule of
former president Chun Doo-hwan, who stepped down in 1988, by
imposing restrictions on all opposition groups.
   Roh, a former general, won presidential elections in late 1987
after rival opposition candidates split the anti-government vote.
He has helped introduce democratic reforms, but many Koreans
distrust the government because of its ties to the Chun regime.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Cultural Center in the
southern provincial city of Kwangju, a frequent target of violent
attacks by radical students, was closed today, American officials
said.
   The center had been a target by radicals who oppose the presence
of 43,000 U.S. troops based in the country under a mutual defense
treaty.
   A notice was posted on the front gate saying the center would be
closed temporarily while a new site is chosen, the U.S. embassy
said.
   It was the first closure of a U.S. cultural center in 40 years
and the embassy played down the event, saying it was temporary for
an office move.
   The closure precedes the anniversary May 18 of the bloody 1980
Kwangju civil uprising in which 200 people were killed and 1,000
injured.
   Anti-American sentiment is strong in Kwangju; residents blame
U.S. officials for doing nothing during the crackdown.
   Elsewhere, farmers protesting imports of U.S. agricultural
products staged a sit-in outside the U.S. ambassador's residence
today. Police said 26 were arrested.
   The sit-in was brief and peaceful, witnesses said. The
residence, on a narrow street near downtown, has been uninhabited
since the last ambassador left in January. A new ambassador has yet
to arrive.
   ``U.S. trade pressure is endangering our life and South Korea's
agriculture industry,'' said leaflets distributed by the farmers.
   Yonhap, the South Korean news agency, said U.S. officials tried
to move the cultural center to an outlying center of Kwangju, 160
miles from Seoul, but that residents of the area complained and a
new site has not been found.
   The center has been attacked repeatedly since 1980 by students
wielding firebombs and yelling anti-American slogans. The U.S.
State Department said last January that the center would be moved
if the attacks continued or if there was concern for safety of the
staff.
   Dissidents and radical students welcomed the closure, claiming
the center should remain closed permanently. Newspapers in Seoul
called the closure a measure to avoid possible trouble during the
Kwangju anniversary.

   Rain soaked much of the East early today while thunderstorms
rocked several Western states with damaging winds and hail.
   Moist, unstable air over the northern Rockies triggered strong
thunderstorms Tuesday evening.
   Thunderstorm winds gusted up to 69 mph in Idaho, damaging
buildings and downing trees and power lines in the state's
southeast corner. Winds also gusted up to 62 mph at Grand Junction,
Colo., and up to 51 mph at Big Piney, Wyo.
   A thunderstorm at White Rock, N.M., dumped 1\ inches of rain and
three-quarter inch hail that covered the ground and dented
automobiles.
   Strong thunderstorms rumbled over southern Texas, with golf
ball-size hail falling on Edwards County.
   Locally heavy rains also occurred across central and northern
California.
   Elsewhere, showers and thunderstorms extended along a cold front
from southern Mississippi across central Georgia to the southern
Atlantic Coast. Heavy rains caused water to rise over roads and
bridges in northwest Union County, N.C.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 a.m. EDT
included more than 1\ inches in Atlanta and more than
three-quarters of an inch at Fayetteville, Charlotte and Goldsboro

<TEXT>
   To prove that old bones can still tell tales,
plans are afoot to open a Colorado grave and establish whether five
prospectors were eaten by the legendary Alferd G. Packer, or
someone else, or not at all.
   James Starrs, professor of law and forensic science at George
Washington University's National Law Center, plans to lead an
expedition for evidence that cannibalism was committed during that
awful April in 1874.
   Packer, a Union Army veteran, has stood accused in verse and
mirth of killing the victims and eating their flesh. Packer said he
killed one prospector, in self-defense, and he denied eating anyone.
   So famous is the case that a cafeteria at the University of
Colorado, and the one in the Department of Agriculture here, are
named in Packer's honor, a mocking commentary on their culinary
qualities.
   Starrs, one of the nation's forensic experts, insists his
purpose is scientific: to show how anthropology _ the study of man,
his customs, culture, and social relationships _ can combine with
archeology and pathology in solving crimes.
   Even after 115 years, he said, the bones will tell if
cannibalism occurred. ``Any scraping of tissue of flesh should
leave evidence on the bone,'' he said. The examination may even
show whether the starving prospectors ate their shoeleather, as
alleged.
   The search will start July 17 at a grave at the foothills of the
San Juan Mountains near Lake City, Colo.
   The undertaking has a critic in Ervan F. Kushner, 74, an amateur
historian and Packer defender. He calls Starrs' plans ``macabre''
and says, ``I don't see the point of it.''
   Kushner, a retired judge and prosecutor from Paterson, N.J., is
author of ``Alferd G. Packer: Cannibal! Victim?''
   ``Mr. Starrs is a well-known forensics expert,'' Kushner said,
``but what possible proof can there be found in the bones as to
motive? If he enjoys digging in that beautiful scenery, that's a
great place to dig, but how will it establish who struck the first
blow?''
   Some facts are known. Packer admitted killing Shannon Wilson
Bell, one of the prospectors, but he said he acted out of
self-defense, and claimed Bell had killed and cannibalized their
fellow miners.
   Kushner said Packer, too, may have stripped flesh from the
corpses, but only for self-preservation.
   But Starrs, a 30-year student of the case, said Packer ``was a
concerted and deliberate and long-term liar throughout the trial.
His five-hour narration is filled with inconsistency and glaring
falsehoods.''
   By Packer's account, an awesome snowstorm in the Colorado
Rockies stranded the prospectors and left them starving for a
month. So he took a rifle and set out to kill an animal.
   Five days later, he returned empty-handed, only to find four of
his fellows dead and the hunger-crazed Bell about to attack him
with a hatchet, Packer told the authorities. He said he shot and
killed Bell. He said some human remains were boiling in a stewpot.
   He fled, was captured but escaped. Recaptured nine years later,
he was tried for murder and sentenced to hang. He wasn't charged
with cannibalism _ it's not a crime _ but the accusation hung in
the air.
   Starrs said he can put to rest as a bartender's fabrication an
account that says presiding judge Melville B. Gerry, in sentencing
Packer to hang, bemoaned that there had been only seven Democrats
in all of Hinsdale County ``and ye ate five of 'em!''
   The Colorado Supreme Court set aside the conviction because the
legislature had repealed the death sentence during the time Packer
was a fugitive.
   Retried for manslaughter, Packer was sentenced to 40 years and
paroled after 17. He died in 1907, still proclaiming innocence of
murder.
   In 1981, Kushner petitioned Richard D. Lamm, then the governor
of Colorado, to pardon Packer posthumously. Lamm wouldn't, but said
he found himself agreeing with another Packer defender, poet Olive
Nagel Porter:
   ``Let's not condemn poor Packer
   Nor crowd his soul with abuse
   Though he hardly would merit approval,

   The remains of 19 Chinese soldiers
killed during the 1950-53 Korean War will be returned to their
homeland, military authorities said today.
   The U.S.-led U.N. command said the remains would be turned over
to China on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom in the
demilitarized zone that separates North Korea and South Korea.
   The last attempt to return remains of soldiers to North Korea
was in June 1987, but the north refused to accept them and the
bodies were buried in the south. The U.N. command has asked for the
return of bodies of U.S. soldiers still believed to be in the north.
   Korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist
south at the end of World War II. In 1950, the north invaded the
south to begin the Korean War. China sided with the north and U.S.
troops fought with the south.
   The Chinese remains were recovered near Chipyong-ni, about 30
miles east of Seoul and the site of a major battle in 1951.
Officials were not immediately available for comment on when the
remains were found or under what circumstances.

   A fire caused extensive damage to the French

but no one was injured, authorities said.
   Crews from six fire engines fought the blaze, which was first
reported at 5:40 a.m., said a Fire Brigade spokesman who requested
anonymity.
   ``The fire is not being treated as suspicious at this stage,''
said a Scotland Yard spokeswoman. She said the blaze was brought
under control in less than one hour, and there were no injuries.
   ``There is extensive damage to the first and second floors and
smoke damage to the third and fourth floors,'' she said.

   President Bush says he wishes convicted felon
Oliver North had been absolved of all crimes in the Iran-Contra
affair but says, ``I'm not going to argue with the courts.''
   Bush, who has the power to pardon North, said Tuesday he would
not comment on the case further as North appeals the verdict. North
was convicted last Thursday on three of 12 felony counts.
   The president broke his silence on the North verdict during a
brief question and answer session with reporters in the Oval Office.
   Today, Bush traveled to the Bethesda Naval Medical Center in
suburban Maryland to undergo his first medical checkup as president.
   ``Never felt better in my life,'' said Bush, who is 64.
   Bush also was optimistic about prospects for resolving a dispute
with West Germany over modernizing short-range nuclear weapons in
Europe.
   Bonn has called for East-West negotiations soon to reduce the
weapons but Bush has rejected the idea on grounds they are needed
to offset the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact's superiority in conventional
forces.
   The dispute threatens Western solidarity as NATO prepares for a
summit in Brussels May 29-30 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of
the alliance.
   ``I have a good feeling that there's been a lot of smoke and
that we'll have a smooth summit,'' Bush said.
   Asked if he were willing to compromise, Bush replied, ``It might
mean people are willing to do it our way _ with the United States.''
   Bush added, ``This alliance is not going to fall apart. It is
going to stay together and be strong.''
   On the subject of North, the White House has said that Bush has
not discussed the possibility of a pardon.
   North, a onetime aide on the White House National Security
Council, is awaiting sentencing on his convictions of illegally
destroying and altering government documents, accepting an illegal
gratuity and aiding and abetting in obstruction of Congress'
investigation of the Iran-Contra affair.
   Asked his opinion of the verdict, Bush said, ``As you know, I
wanted all along to see him exonerated.
   ``The matter is now under appeal and thus I'll have nothing more
to say about it while it is,'' said Bush, who has called North a
hero.
   Asked directly if he believed North was innocent, Bush said,
``Well, I'm not going to argue with the courts. The process is
being appealed.
   ``He's entitled to the right of appeal without a lot of
editorial comment from me, although I've already given you some.''
   Bush was asked by a reporter, ``You don't believe in shredding
documents, do you?''
   He scooped up some documents he'd left on his desk and jokingly
said, ``No, I believe in taking them with me.''
   Bush's meeting with reporters was hurriedly arranged to provide
an opportunity for him to comment on the outcome of the
presidential elections in Panama, which the United States says were
rigged and stolen by military strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Bush said the voting was marred by fraud and ``massive
irregularities'' and called on Noriega to ``heed the call of the
people'' and relinquish power.
   ``And I call on all foreign leaders to urge Noriega to honor the
clear results of the election,'' Bush said.
   The United States says a fair counting of the ballots in Panama
would show that opposition candidate Guillermo Endara easily
defeated Noriega's handpicked choice, Carlos Duque.

<HEAD>French Poet Elected President Of PEN</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   French poet Rene Tavernier was
elected president of PEN today, succeeding British novelist Francis
King, who headed the international writers' association for three
years.
   Tavernier, 74, was elected by 35 votes to 30, defeating Nigerian
poet, novelist and short story writer Chinua Achebe, according to
PEN spokeswoman Margot Dijkgraaf. There were two abstentions, she
said.
   PEN _ or Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists _
was founded in 1921 and has about 60 local chapters and 10,000
members worldwide.
   Tavernier's candidacy was sponsored mainly by the group's
French-speaking chapters, with Achebe being backed by the
English-speaking groups.
   Tavernier thinks his most important role is to counteract the
meaninglessness of the language used by the electronic mass media,
according to a biography of the poet, made available to reporters
attending PEN's 53rd annual conference in this southern city. In
Tavernier's view, ``The poet is in some way the lifeline of a world
in which language is being permitted to dwindle to
insignificance,'' the biography said.
   From 1941-50, Tavernier edited ``Confluences,'' the most
important literary magazine of the French resistance. His recent
works include two poetry collections, ``34 Poems'' and ``Questions
To The Rising Sun.''
   Later today, the conference was expected to admit a new Soviet
chapter in a move that would open PEN to the Soviet Union for the
first time in 65 years.

   Customs officers say they seized one
of the world's most sophisticated cameras, used in missile
technology, before it could be flown to the Soviet Union.
   The camera was confiscated at Birmingham's airport on Monday,
and the officers said they were questioning two businessmen who had
been arrested early Tuesday in nearby Rugby and in London.
   The officers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
camera is capable of photographing 2,500 frames a second and costs
about $417,500.
   A customs spokesman said the camera was made in Britain, but he
would not identify it further.
   Because the camera is used in nuclear missile technology,
British regulations restricted its export to the 16-nation NATO
alliance and Japan.
   Customs officers said they suspected that similar
high-technology cameras and laser equipment, shipped through
intermediate countries, had been smuggled to East European
communist countries.

   President Bush is calling on democratic allies
to rally against Panama's Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, but U.S.
officials are playing down talk of an American military response to
what they call a fraudulent election in the Central American nation.
   In considering the scope of measures, officials ranging from
Panama's opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, to Peru's
President Alan Garcia and former President Jimmy Carter cautioned
against U.S. troop involvement.
   Bush and his advisers kept alive the prospect of military
intervention Tuesday by saying all options were being considered.
Administration officials said privately, however, that such a
unilateral step was unlikely.
   ``I don't think it's necessary to take action immediately,''
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a senior member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show this morning.
``The opposition in Panama is counseling calm, and they're in the
best position to know.''
   Bush would not say what actions he was considering in the wake
of what he called a fraudulent election that nonetheless was won by
anti-Noriega forces.
   ``The Panamanian people have spoken, and I call on General
Noriega to respect the voice of the people, and I call on all
foreign leaders to urge General Noriega to honor the clear results
of the election,'' the president told reporters.
   Bush was briefed Tuesday by two election observer groups
including one headed by Carter, just back from Central America
after monitoring Sunday's elections.
   The observers said there was rampant fraud in voting and ballot
counting. Bush embraced the conclusions of the observers and the
Catholic Church in Panama that the Noriega opposition won a 3-1
victory.
   ``Despite massive irregularities at the polls, the opposition
has won a clear-cut overwhelming victory, '' Bush told reporters in
a brief Oval Office session. ``There has been a statement for
democracy so loud and so clear that perhaps even General Noriega
will listen to it.''
   The president said that Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez
was encouraging neighboring countries to issue a joint statement
``against the fraud that is taking place and calling on Noriega to
honor the results of this election.''
   The vote was considered a referendum on Noriega, chief of the
15,000-member Defense Forces, whom the United States has been
trying to depose for more than a year.
   Bush said he would not discuss what he might do until after the
official vote results were announced. The Noriega-led government
claimed that partial returns showed that its candidate, Carlos
Duque, had defeated opposition candidate Endara.
   While White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
considering options ranging from military force to economic
sanctions against Panama, other officials minimized the military
angle. They said the United States could decide to beef up U.S.
forces to protect Americans living in Panama or help to move them
out.
   More stringent economic sanctions also were a possibility. The
United States has been withholding operating fees for the Panama
Canal from the Panamanian government, and has barred U.S. firms
from paying any taxes or fees to the Panamanian government.
   Fitzwater said U.S. military personnel in Panama had been
harassed and were on a ``very high state of alert.''
   Talking to reporters outside the White House, Carter cautioned
against U.S. abrogation of the Panama Canal treaties, signed under
his administration, and against military confrontation.
   ``Any sort of military involvement down there would immediately
alienate the Panamanian people who respect their nation's
sovereignty as do we,'' Carter said.
   The Panama Canal treaties, under which the United States is to
turn over the canal to Panamanian control at the end of this
century, are a ``sacred issue'' with the Panamanians, Carter said.
Breaking them would ``play right into the hands of Noriega'' and
``alienate every other nation in this hemisphere.''
   Fitzwater earlier said there were no plans to break the
treaties, but he hinted the administration might apply pressure
through provisions on protection of U.S. citizens there and of the
strategic canal itself.
   One member of Bush's official observer team, Democratic Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida, urged Bush to withdraw U.S. military dependents
and citizens from Panama while beefing up the number of combatants
among the 10,000 U.S. troops there.
   Fitzwater said he did not think an evacuation of dependents was
underway, but added, ``That's not to say there isn't planning under
way that would accommodate a number of movements of one kind or
another.''

   Days after a heart attack interrupted _
but didn't stop _ her piano recital, 77-year-old Sarah Jennings is
itching to get out of the hospital and on with her life.
   ``She's a pistol,'' said her pastor, the Rev. Wayne Terry of
Saxon Baptist Church. ``And plays the piano exceptionally well.''
   Ms. Jennings is doing well after having a pacemaker implanted on
Tuesday, Terry said.
   The pianist suffered a heart attack during a church recital
Sunday. She slumped over the keyboard and was lifted onto the floor
by members of the congregation.
   ``After what seemed like an eternity, but I'd guess it was a
minute or so, she opened her eyes and said, `What are you all doing
over me?' She was ready to go on right then,'' Terry recalled.
   After a nurse checked her pulse and a rescue squad examined her,
the show did go on. ``She said, `I don't care if it's okay or not,
I'm going ahead,''' the pastor said.
   Ms. Jennings played the remaining 13 songs on her program,
mostly gospel songs with a classical twist, and finished to a
standing ovation. The 45-minute program moved the audience to
tears. She was then taken to Mary Black Memorial Hospital.
   Ms. Jennings had said before the recital that it would be her
last. She planned to retire to take care of her 88-year-old sister,
Terry said.
   She is spending at least some of her time in the hospital
worrying about her sister.
   ``She told her family yesterday, `I need to get out of here and
take care of her,''' the pastor said.

   A U.S. F1-11E bomber made an
emergency landing shortly after takeoff when it developed engine
trouble, an Air Force spokesman said today.
   Local residents near the Upper Heyford air base called police
when the plane jettisoned high-octane fuel to reduce the risk of an
explosion on landing and the jet's exhaust plume ignited the fuel
in a ball of flame.
   The supersonic bomber is capable of carrying nuclear weapons but
had no such weapons aboard during the Tuesday night training
flight, said the spokesman. The jet returned to the base 60 miles
northwest of London two minutes after taking off, he said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The jet was not damaged and the two crewmen were not injured, he
said. ``At no time were British residents in the area in danger,''
the spokesman said.
   An investigation will be carried out into the cause of an
``engine problem,'' he said, but he refused to say what had gone
wrong.
   The U.S. Air Force keeps about 150 F1-11s at Upper Heyford and
Lakenheath bases in England. Each aircraft is capable of carrying
three nuclear free-fall bombs over a range of 1,500 miles without
refueling.
   Bruce Kent, chairman of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament,
said some F1-11s are on constant alert armed with nuclear weapons,
raising concerns about a catastrophic crash.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Modern art valued at more than $60 million,
including a classic ``drip'' painting by Jackson Pollock, has been
donated to the Museum of Contemporary Art.
   The gift of 18 works by 13 artists is from the estate of Rita
and Taft Schreiber and also includes art by Piet Mondrian, Arshile
Gorky and Joan Miro.
   Schreiber, who died in 1976, was Ronald Reagan's Hollywood press
agent and a member of his ``kitchen cabinet'' when he was governor
of California. Mrs. Schreiber, who died earlier this year, was a
frequent visitor to the museum.
   ``It was my mother's wish that these works of art remain in Los
Angeles where she and my father lived,'' said the couple's
daughter, Lenore Greenberg, MOCA board president.
   The 18 pieces are considered the best of the widely admired
Schreiber collection, said Richard Koshalek, director of the
10-year-old museum.
   ``With these works, we are able to strengthen the foundation of
our museum, providing brilliant historical context for much of the
work being created today,'' he said.
   He said the collection was assembled with ``extraordinary
sensitivity, passion and clear-sighted discipline.''
   The works span from 1930 to the mid-1960s. Predominant among
them is Pollock's ``Number 1,'' a classic ``drip'' painting from
1949.
   Other works include Mondrian's 1939 ``Abstract Painting,'' Mark
Rothko's 1949 ``Yellow and Orange-(Red),'' two versions of Alberto
Giacometti's 1960 sculpture ``Tall Figure'' and his ``Interior
Studio with Three Apples.''
   Also included are Miro's 1949 ``Personnages dan La Nuit,''
Gorky's 1947 ``Betrothal I,'' Pierre Alchinsky's 1960 ``Pres de La
Bete,'' Alexander Calder's 1964 ``Portrait,'' Morris Louis' 1961
``Pillar of Delay'' and Jean Dubuffet's 1962 ``L'Ecoulment De La

<HEAD>Millions Of Italians Strike Over Increased Health Fees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Millions of Italian workers stayed off the job today
in a general strike called by Italy's three main labor unions to
protest a change in the government's health plan requiring payment
of nominal fees.
   Schools shut for the day, banks and public offices closed in the
morning and newspapers didn't publish. City bus drivers struck for
two hours.
   Union rallies were held in major cities.
   The unions urged 16 million workers to strike for up to four
hours to protest what they say is an unfair burden on workers and
the elderly.
   The so-called ``ticket system'' went into effect April 1 and
requires the payment of small fees for hospitalization and medical
tests in state hospitals.
   Premier Ciriaco De Mita denounced the strike, saying people are
prepared to spend large amounts of money to attend soccer games or
take weekend vacations but not to pay the $7 daily fee required for
hospitalization.
   ``Whoever thinks that this strike is disproportionate in respect
to the (fees) is making a mistake,'' social activist Giovanni Moro
told a rally in Florence, where unions said 150,000 people turned
out. ``Above all, they don't understand that citizens of the
world's fifth industrial power don't want a Third World health
system.''
   The strike was called by the communist-dominated General
Federation of Italian Labor, the mostly Christian Democratic
Italian Federation of Union Workers and the Socialist-led Italian
Union of Workers.

<DATELINE>ARGONNE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Taking the train to the plane is the way to
go in the future, say Argonne National Laboratory researchers who
recommend replacing short-haul jets with a $30 billion nationwide
high-speed rail network.
   The cost of the 2,000-mile network of 300 mph magnetic
levitation trains would be largely offset by reducing airline
delays and energy, aircraft acquisition and airport construction
costs, says a soon-to-be-released report.
   The report suggests that airlines run the system in place of
jets that travel from hub airports to cities up to 600 miles away.
The trains would allow airports to concentrate on handling longer
flights, the report said.
   ``Every study before ours has looked at magnetic levitation as
railroad technology,'' Larry R. Johnson, director of Argonne's
Center for Transportation Research, said in today's Chicago
Tribune. ``Ours is the first to integrate it into airline and
airport operations.''
   Magnetic levitation uses powerful magnets to lift a train above
a guideway and propel it on a cushion of air.
   ``At 300 mph, a maglev can compete with jet aircraft up to
distances of 600 miles,'' Johnson said.
   The report proposes that the trains run on elevated tracks
alongside interstate highways.
   ``The airlines at first viewed the concept as a threat,'' said
William R. Nesbit, a retired United Airlines economist who
participated in the study. ``But if they follow the logic, the fuel
and labor savings alone are big.''

<TEXT>
   Six of Sri Lanka's eight universities
reopened today, two years after the government shut them to stem
student unrest and violent anti-government demonstrations.
   There were no violent incidents today. But a third of the
students boycotted classes, and at least 850 university janitors
and clerks went on strike to demand higher wages, the Higher
Education Ministry.
   Ministry officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the closures have caused an acute shortage of professionals in the
country.
   Military and government officials said the six colleges were
power bases for the extremist People's Liberation Front, a radical
group of the majority Sinhalese people who are waging a terror
campaign against the government.
   Higher Education Minister Shahul Hameed last month decided to
reopen the colleges after he met representatives of the
Inter-Universities Students Federation, an umbrella body of
scholars from the six universities.
   He said student grievances had been resolved, but the federation
said they were not and called for class boycotts.
   The federation says soldiers have killed at least 26 students
among dozens arrested, and it wants an accounting.
   About 60 percent of the country's 24,000 undergraduates ignored
the boycott and showed up a school, the minisry said.
   Elsehwere in Sri Lanka today, military officials reported
militants from the front killed at least 10 Sinhalese in separate
incidents since Tuesday.
   Four people, including two school principals, were killed and
their bodies dumped in a cemetery at Polgahawela village, 85 miles
northeast of Colombo.
   Six activists in the governing United National Party were killed
in southern villages, the military officials said on condition of
anonymity.
   The ultra-left front is blamed for the killings of more than
3,500 people since it launched its anti-government campaign in July
1987 to protest peace overtures made to Tamil rebels fighting since
1983 for an independent nation.
   Tamils, who form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population, say the
dominant Sinhalese discriminate against them in jobs and education
and have tried to supplant their Tamil language with Sinhalese.
More than 9,000 people have died in the Tamil insurrection, mostly
Sinhalese civilians.

   A bank robber dubbed the ``Miss America''
bandit because of her glamorous disguises received a light two
years in prison from a judge who said she had come under the
influence of a Svengali-like boyfriend.
   ``The history of it is that men have exercised traditional
control over the activities of women, and I'm not going to ignore
that, no matter how much flak I get from women's lib,'' U.S.
District Judge A. Andrew Hauk said Tuesday.
   Danielle Tyece Mast, 24, of Reedsport, Ore., a former
cheerleader and bank teller who favored fashionable wigs and
sunglasses as disguises, was convicted of taking $13,000 in five
holdups last summer. She could have received up to five years in
prison.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Gregory W. Alarcon asked for a stiff
sentence, but Hauk, one of the most experienced judges on the
federal bench, agreed with Miss Mast's lawyer that she acted under
the spell of her live-in boyfriend.
   ``I think it's a fact of life that men can exercise a Svengali
influence over women,'' Hauk declared. He added, ``Women are a soft
touch, particularly if sex is involved.''
   The prosecutor complained that Miss Mast had shown no remorse,
and he argued that the boyfriend wasn't present during any of the
robberies and hasn't been charged.
   Feminist attorney Gloria Allred said Hauk's remarks were
unfortunate.
   ``That is an untrue stereotype, that men are able to control
women,'' she said. ``Unscientific generalizations such as this one
have no place in the courtroom or in the decision-making process.''

   Authorities today arrested the
former head of a West Germany company at the center of a scandal
involving a suspected chemical weapons plant in Libya, a prosecutor
said.
   West German and U.S. authorities alleged that the company,
Imhausen-Chemie, was the key supplier of material for the plant in
the Libyan city of Rabta. Libya claimed the plant was for making
pharmaceuticals, but U.S. and West German officials claim it was
intended to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, who was chief of Imhausen-Chemie
until March, was arrested in the city of Bochum, said prosecutor
Holger Preisendanz, who is leading the probe into the case.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen is ``strongly suspected'' of violating West
German export laws, Preisendanz told The Associated Press in a
telephone interview.
   Preisendanz said he had received evidence of such violations
since he began investigating the case in February, but he refused
to release details.
   ``The arrest is in connection with the probe into the Libyan
plant,'' the prosecutor said, adding that Hippenstiel-Imhausen had
not been indicted.
   The prosecutor said authorities were concerned that
Hippenstiel-Imhausen may have been preparing to flee West Germany.
Hippenstiel-Imhausen resigned in March as head of the family-owned
company in the Black Forest city of Lahr.
   In Bochum, judicial authorities released a statement saying they
were concerned that Hippenstiel-Imhausen might have been trying to
hide evidence needed for the investigation.

   Soviet arms control experts, in an unusual
appearance on Capitol Hill, said hard-liners are growing impatient
with Kremlin concessions and denied U.S. intelligence reports that
Soviet military production continues at previous levels.
   ``There are many people in the Soviet Union, and their voices
are heard, who raise the question, `To what extent can we do these
unilateral steps without a response from the other side?''' said
Andrei Kokoshin, one of the leading proponents of the Soviet ``new
thinking'' on national security issues.
   The remarks by Kokoshin, deputy director of Moscow's USA-Canada
Institute, and three other prominent Soviet civilian experts on
military affairs clearly were aimed at spurring the Bush
administration in arms talks with the Kremlin.
   Those talks were expected to regain momentum after Secretary of
State James A. Baker III met in Moscow today with his Soviet
counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze. Baker was to meet Thursday
with Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The Capitol Hill session generally was friendly, as House Armed
Services Committee chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., and Kokoshin
addressed each other as ``Les'' and ``Andrei.'' By contrast, when
Cabinet members testify, they usually call Aspin ``Mr. Chairman,''
and are addressed as ``Mr. or Mrs. Secretary.''
   Despite the informal atmosphere, three panel members expressed
concern about the testimony and several all but accused the Soviets
of lying.
   Rep. Richard Ray, D-Ga., asked the Soviets to discuss warnings
by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other Americans that ``the
goals of the Soviet Union have really not changed'' despite the
reforms.
   ``They point to the fact that weapons manufacturing continues,
tank production at 278 a month continues with no letup, submarine
building, ship building, airplane building, and so forth, continues
to be modernized,'' said Ray.
   Kokoshin said weapons production was down. New Soviet policy
``includes not only unilateral cuts in the Armed Forces and arms
which we possess now, but also the decrease of the production of
military hardware,'' Kokoshin said.
   ``I know that we are cutting the production,'' he said.
   Roald Sagdeyev, a prominent reformer elected to the newly
created Congress of Peoples' Deputies, told the House panel that
Soviet military spending had been cut by 1.5 percent this year, and
would be cut by 7 percent next year and 14.2 percent in 1991.
   The actual Soviet military budget has not been published,
Kokoshin and Sagdeyev acknowledged, but they said the figure would
be revealed in June.
   Intelligence sources said preliminary data indicated that during
the first four months of 1989, Soviet tank production had risen
from the previous level of 3,200 to 3,400 a year, in the same range
as Ray's figure.
   But the statistics were under review, and the surge was believed
to be temporary and related to plans to close down production lines
rather than to reflect Soviet intentions to boost annual output,
according to intelligence sources who asked not to be further
identified.
   A report by Central Intelligence Agency and Pentagon analysts
released last month estimated that Soviet defense spending
increased by 3 percent last year, but cited evidence that Gorbachev
planned to make good on his pledge to cut that level by 14.2
percent.
   The ranking Republican in the panel, Rep. William Dickinson of
Alabama, complained that the Soviets had deployed anti-satellite
weapons.
   Sagdeyev, who formerly headed the Soviet Institute for Space
Exploration, replied that ``I have serious doubts if Russians, my
Russian military space counterparts, have anything like an
operational (ASAT) system.''
   ``Our intelligence apparatus tells us that you do have in fact
more than one (ASAT) operational capability,'' Dickinson responded.
   Dickinson expressed reservations about the presence of the
Soviet delegation and the reluctance of the Soviet government to
grant visas to members of the Armed Services Committee to travel to
Moscow later this month.
   ``I have mixed feelings about foreign witnesses testifying
before the committee in open session on diplomatically sensitive
foreign national issues. We are prohibited by law from
negotiating,'' Dickinson said.
   Rep. Beverly Byron, D-Md., also complained about the visa issue.
   Soviet officials and scholars have testified before Congress at
least twice previously. In April 1986, Vitaly Churkin, then a third
secretary at the Soviet Embassy in Washington, appeared before a
House panel to answer questions about the Chernobyl nuclear reactor
accident, and Kokoshin appeared before the House Armed Services
Committee earlier this year.

   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III held
his first round of talks today with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze and they jointly pledged to produce ``good
results'' for superpower relations.
   The two-hour, 45-minute session at a Foreign Ministry mansion
established goals and ground rules for four working groups that
opened discussions on arms control, human rights, regional problems
and direct U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We are very pleased with the way things started,'' Baker said.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, a foreign ministry spokesman, said Baker
and Shevardnadze, at the request of the American side, concentrated
on regional conflicts, including the Middle East, Central America
and Afghanistan.
   ``Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last
of the Cold War behind us and move into a new stage of our
relationship,'' Gerasimov said.
   He said the subject of short-range missiles in Europe did not
come up.
   The two sides found common ground on Central America, Gerasimov
said. ``Both sides stated there was good potential for a furthering
of dialogue on a Central American settlement,'' he said.
   Baker wants the Soviets to curb their aid to the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua, which amounted to $500 million last year. The Soviets
also raised Afghanistan, a topic Baker had no intention of bringing
up because the Kremlin is demanding the United States halt its
military aid to Afghan rebels.
   In both countries, Marxist governments have Soviet support,
while the United States is backing the insurgents _ with weapons
through Pakistan for the Mujahadeen and with non-lethal aid to the
Contras in Nicaragua.
   According to Gerasimov, Baker and Shevardnadze also discussed
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's prediction that perestroika,
the restructuring program of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, would
fail.
   Baker explained that Cheney's remarks did not reflect
Washington's official position, and Shevardnadze did not take
offense, Gerasimov said.
   ``We understand that the secretary of defense needs more money
for military programs and how can he possibly obtain that if the
Soviet threat is going away?'' Gerasimov said. ``We were not
offended.''
   Baker, in the Soviet Union for the first time, later met with
three members of the Congress of People's Deputies, a new
parliament elected as Gorbachev gives greater powers to the
legislative arm of government.
   ``We think there are real changes taking place in the Soviet
Union, and we think those changes are more than cosmetic, as
demonstrated by the fact that we now see competitive elections,
looking towards a sitting legislature,'' Baker said at the meeting
at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The congress is to meet May 25 to choose a smaller, full-time
legislature, as well as a president. Asked if more than one
candidate should run for president, Baker said, ``One step at a
time.''
   In two days of talks, Baker is expected to turn to Gorbachev for
help in accelerating the fledling U.S. drive for Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
   The U.S. approach to the Middle East represents a shift in
diplomatic gears from two decades of trying to fence out both the
Soviet Union and the Palestine Liberation Organization as apt to
undermine American peace-making.
   Once before, in 1977, the United States made a concerted effort
to engage the Soviet Union in Middle East peace-making. The Carter
administration at that point was at a dead-end in its Mideast
diplomacy.
   But Egypt and Israel quickly decided to launch negotiations, and
the Soviets were shut out again.
   Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and since then
have been the largest recipients of U.S. aid and solidly on the
American side of the superpower divide.
   But Baker is faced with a different situation. He is trying to
prod Israel into negotiations with the Palestinians and has
concluded he needs the support of both Moscow and the PLO.
   He is hoping the Soviets under Gorbachev would bring pressure on
Syria to support peace talks that do not hold out the promise of a
Palestinian state. The Soviet Union has refused to exert such power
in the past.
   The PLO, meanwhile, quietly has been assured that if Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for Palestinian elections does
not break the diplomatic stalemate in the Middle East the Bush
administration will look for alternatives.
   At the same time, Baker and his senior advisers are convinced
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is sincere about his public acceptance
of Israel.
   If the Soviets push the missile issue they could widen the
fissures between the United States and West Germany over NATO's
nuclear arsenal.
   The Bush administration, supported mostly by Britain, wants to
enhance the range of the 88 Lance launchers and their 700 or so
missiles, most of which are in West Germany, while Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, backed by a majority of the alliance, is resisting and
calling for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on such weapons in Europe.
   By contrast, Baker is playing down arms control.
   He headed to Moscow with a proposed date _ the third week in
June _ for the reopening of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce the
superpowers' long-range bombers, nuclear submarines and
globe-girdling missiles.
   But he was not planning to outline the position the United
States would take at the table. Nor was he assuring the Soviets
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in
November.

<TEXT>
   A mobster's decision to turn informant may
finally enable prosecutors to link Mafia boss Nicodemo ``Little
Nicky'' Scarfo to the Atlantic City casinos, law enforcement
sources say.
   Lawrence ``Yogi'' Merlino, facing up to a 40-year prison term in
a federal racketeering conspiracy, agreed to cooperate in an
attempt to shorten his possible jail time, a source said Tuesday.
   Merlino already is serving a life term for murder in a 1985 mob
hit and cannot be paroled unless the governor commutes the sentence.
   ``We think he's got a lot to say,'' an investigator said about
Merlino, the fourth member of Scarfo's mob to break the code of
silence and become an informant.
   The 42-year-old Merlino has been associated with two companies
that reportedly did millions of dollars in Atlantic City
construction, some with the casinos.
   For years FBI agents and New Jersey State Police, despite their
suspicions, have been unable to get sufficient evidence to charge
the mob with infiltrating the construction industry and casino
unions.
   Merlino's lawyer, Nino Tinari, declined to comment on the
reported defection.
   Scarfo's lawyer, Robert Simone, said, ``Nothing surprises me
anymore, but I will be surprised if a new informant comes out of
the woodwork.''
   Merlino was convicted with Scarfo and six others last month in
the murder of gangster Frank ``Frankie Flowers'' D'Alfonso. All got
life terms.
   Seventeen men were convicted in November in the racketeering
case, which involved nine murders, four attempted murders,
extortions, drug dealing, loan sharking and gambling.

<HEAD>Civil Rights Groups Oppose Lucas in Justice Post</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A coalition of civil rights organizations is
voicing its opposition to the appointment of William Lucas to head
the Justice Department's civil rights division.
   The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said Tuesday that
Lucas doesn't have the experience or litigation skills needed in
the position, which is the federal government's top civil rights
job.
   The conference is an umbrella group of 180 organizations and the
opposition was adopted ``by consensus'' at a meeting of the
conference, according to Ralph Neas, executive director of the
organization.
   Neas and Benjamin Hooks, chairman of the conference, said Lucas
``may well be qualified for other important positions in the
federal government, but he does not have the experience, the
substantive knowledge of the increasingly technical field of civil
rights, or the litigation skills to carry out the duties
effectively.''
   The NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, a New York-based
civil rights organization, said in a separate announcement that it
would oppose the nomination because Lucas lacked the ``knowledge
and experience'' for the position.
   People for the American Way, a 275,000-member ``constitutional
liberties organization,'' also announced its opposition to Lucas.
Group President Arthur J. Kropp said in a statement that Lucas
``has demonstrated none of the civil rights experience so necessary
for this position, has no litigation experience whatsoever and has
barely a few months of legal experience.''
   The opposition was the latest round in the controversy swirling
around Lucas, a black Detroit lawyer. Lucas, 61, also has been an
FBI agent, sheriff of Wayne County, Mich., and the chief executive
of that county.

<NOTE>Agency Tightens Workers' Safeguards</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Direct exposure to the pesticide bromoxynil
could cause birth defects, the Environmental Protection Agency has
said in ordering tighter safeguards to protect workers handling the
pesticide.
   The EPA said Tuesday there are only ``negligible'' health risks
to consumers of food products on which the pesticide is used, but
that the risks are substantially greater to workers who come into
direct contact with the chemical.
   Bromoxynil, sold under the trade name Buctril, is used to
control broadleaf weeds in the growing of field corn, wheat,
onions, garlic, mint and flax.
   Under the EPA directive, mixers and other handlers of the
chemical must wear protective clothing, including
chemical-resistant shoes or boots. The manufacturer also must
provide protective labels warning that exposure to a worker during
pregnancy could cause birth defects.
   ``EPA believes that compliance with the new label directions and
restrictions will provide adequate protection from the risk of
birth defects,'' the agency said.

<NOTE>Bush To Propose Turning Family Planning Over To States</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official says the Bush administration will
soon propose legislation to provide state control over current
federal family planning programs, which generate continual
controversy over abortion.
   ``Making the states the sole family planning grantees will
enable them to exercise maximum flexibility in tailoring services
to best meet their citizens' needs,'' said Nabers Chambers, deputy
assistant secretary for population affairs at the Department of
Health and Human Services.
   In advocating the transfer Tuesday, she did not specifically
mention differences over how far federally funded family planning
clinics can go in telling pregnant women about the availablity of
abortion, a matter now being fought in three separate federal court
suits.
   But Ms. Chambers said giving states authority over how to parcel
out the federal money allocated to them for family planning would
allow them ``flexibility to operate clinics through county
agencies, private agencies, or hospitals as is most appropriate for
each particular state.''
   Congress consistently rejected similar efforts by former
President Reagan to transfer the program to state control.

<NOTE>Air Force To Continue Hurricane Hunters For Two Years</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Air Force has agreed to keep its fleet of
``hurricane hunters'' for two years, reversing Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney's plan to scrap weather reconnaissance flights in the
midst of the hurricane season.
   ``It's a good resolution of the problem,'' Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas, said late Tuesday after a group of coastal states
lawmakers met with acting Air Force Secretary Jack Welch and other
officials of the Pentagon and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration.
   NOAA and the Air Force will attempt to work out an agreement
over the next two years on which agency would eventually man the
planes that fly into the eye of a hurricane, lawmakers said.
   It has been suggested the hurricane hunters become the
responsibility of NOAA, but Bentsen and others contend the agency
would be unable to take over the program on such quick notice.
   Cheney said the flights, used to predict the intensity and
position of an approaching hurricane, were not a defense mission
and sought to save at least $14 million annually by slashing the
program.
   But lawmakers complained that phasing it out this summer would
leave hurricane-prone regions dangerously exposed.

   About 50 heavily armed Kenyan rustlers
killed at least 60 civilians and stole nearly 200 cattle and sheep
in northeastern Uganda, the state newspaper reported today.
   New Vision said two Kenyan helicopter gunships crossed into
Uganda as Ugandan soldiers chased the raiders back across the
border. It did not say whether the helicopters fired at the
pursuing troops.
   The area has been the site of several cross-border raids in
recent months by Ugandan and Kenyan tribal warriors who
traditionally raid each other's livestock. Each country accuses the
other of provoking the attacks.
   New Vision said some raiders wore military fatigues during an
attack two weeks ago in Kapchorwa district, 155 miles northeast of
Kampala.

   City Schools Chancellor Richard R. Green, whose
much-heralded arrival last year from Minneapolis brought new hope
to the nation's biggest school system, died today of asthma-related
causes. He was 52.
   The city's first black schools chancellor was brought into St.
Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center suffering from acute respiratory
arrest and died 40 minutes later, said Dr. Kenneth Goetz, the
attending physician.
   ``I was a great admirer of him. I thought that he had the
ability to have a major positive impact on the school system. In
the short time he was here, he demonstrated that,'' said Mayor
Edward I. Koch.
   Green took over the nearly 1 million-student system in March
1988 after a long and bitter selection process that pitted him
against the favorite of the teachers union.
   As an outsider from Minneapolis, where he served seven years as
school superintendent and was widely credited with turning around a
failing system, Green offered hope for new approaches for a school
system plagued with a high dropout rate, crumbling buildings and a
politically combative hierarchy.
   But he soon found himself contending with reports of drug abuse,
theft and sexual misconduct by teachers, principals and school
board officials. In response to the scandals, he suspended two
community school boards.
   Critics faulted him for his low-key approach. But Green
counseled them to ``keep your eye on the prize, and that's the
children of the city, and expect the chancellor will be the No. 1
cheerleader for them.''
   Green was raised in Minneapolis and rose through the
school-system ranks there as a teacher, principal and assistant
superintendent.
   Sandra Feldman, president of the United Federation of Teachers
in New York City, said of Green's death, ``I think it's a terrible
tragedy and a terrible loss for the students and staff.''
   Flags at city schools flew at half-staff today.

<HEAD>Board Blames Crew In 1987 Hard Landing of Eastern Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board says
the crew of an Eastern Airlines jet was to blame when the plane
cracked open on landing in Pensacola, Fla., in 1987.
   The board, in determining probable cause of the incident at a
meeting Tuesday, said the captain failed to maintain a proper
descent rate on final approach and both he and the first officer
failed to properly monitor flight instruments.
   The tail section of the plane was dragged 7,000 feet down the
runway.
   Three of the 105 passengers aboard the DC-9 received minor
injuries. The twin-engine jetliner was landing Dec. 27, 1987, in
rain and fog on a flight from Richmond, Va., after a stopover in
Atlanta.
   Board investigators noted that five other DC-9s had cracked in a
similar manner after similar hard landings that exceeded the
planes' design capabilities. They said they found no signs of metal
fatigue or corrosion in the Eastern plane.
   The hard landing left a two-foot crack circling the fuselage
between the wings and the rear-mounted engines.
   ``The approach got away from the captain,'' said board
investigator Jack Drake. He said the crew should have taken the
plane around for another approach when it failed to stabilize the
approach below 1,000 feet.
   The board's report did not identify the pilot or first officer.

   Solidarity workers found electronic
eavesdropping devices in campaign offices in a northern provincial
capital and demanded that the Interior Ministry investigate, a
union spokesman said today.
   The devices were found in the Solidarity Citizens Committee
office in Slupsk, a city near the Baltic coast 270 miles northeast
of Warsaw.
   Jacek Moskwa, spokesman for the Solidarity committee
coordinating election activities, told reporters in Warsaw the
electronic devices were spotted by campaign workers and reported to
the national campaign headquarters on Tuesday.
   A government spokesman in Warsaw, Pawel Byra, said he knew
nothing about the matter.
   Most leading opposition activists in Poland presume that their
homes and telephones are bugged as a matter of routine, although
the government has said its use of eavesdropping devices is limited
and requires a court order.
   The Slupsk campaign offices were provided by provincial
authorities and are in the building of the Provincial Social and
Recreation Club. Wires from one listening device led to the club
director's office, said a Slupsk Citizens Commission spokeswoman,
Maria Skrowonska.
   The wire disappeared behind some paneling in the office, and
efforts were being made to remove the paneling and follow the wire,
said Mrs. Skrowonska.
   Moskwa said that the Slupsk committee asked the local
prosecutor's office to investigate, but it was turned down. The
national committee then complained Tuesday night at the Interior
Ministry in Warsaw. The ministry oversees the country's police
forces.
   ``We are going to protest officially, and we are also going to
lodge a complaint about being refused an official investigation,''
Moskwa said.
   The committee offices are directing local campaigns for the
Sejm, the existing unicameral parliament chamber, and the Senate,
which is to be the East bloc's first totally freely elected
legislative chamber.
   Under an agreement reached last month, the opposition is
competing for 35 percent, or 161 seats, in the 460-member Sejm, and
for all 100 of the Senate seats. Voting will be held in two stages
June 4 and June 18.

<HEAD>Communist Leadership Offers Talks with Opposition</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party, faced with an
economic crisis and increasing pressure for more democracy, has
offered to hold talks with opposition groups to work out details of
next year's elections.
   The offer from the party's policy-making Central Committee came
Tuesday night after it stripped former leader Janos Kadar of his
last official posts and said he made mistakes that slowed
democratic and economic progress.
   Similar broad-based talks In Poland earlier this year resulted
in the legalization of Solidarity and a more democratic electoral
system.
   The state news agency MTI said in a statement outlining the
offer of negotiations that they would fix an exact date for the
first multiparty elections in Hungary since the communist takeover
in 1948. The talks would also determine rules and procedures for
the elections, expected in June 1990.
   MTI said the leadership would also negotiate over the exact role
of a new constitutional court and revised powers for the state
president.
   It is not the first time the communists have offered talks, but
the latest offer detailed a broader agenda of issues. The numerous
opposition groups have refused earlier offers for talks because the
agenda appeared to be limited and entirely controlled by the
dominant communists.
   The offer came before a parliamentary session opened today.
About 75 percent of the parliament deputies belong to the Communist
Party.
   The Central Committee offer followed its removal of Kadar from
the committee and the honorary post of party president. Kadar, 76,
rose to power behind the Soviet-led invasion of 1956 that crushed a
popular uprising for democracy.
   By stripping Kadar of the posts, the Central Committee appeared
to be trying to appease a public increasingly suspicious of the
role Kadar played in post-invasion repressions, including the
interrogation and execution of former premier and revolutionary
leader Imre Nagy.
   Kadar is rumored to be suffering from cancer. But Central
Committee secretary Gyoergy Fejti declined Tuesday at a news
conference to specify the nature of Kadar's illness.
   At the parliamentary session that opened today, lawmakers
considered a Cabinet shuffle proposed by Premier Miklos Nemeth.
According to Nemeth's plan, Gyula Horn is to take over foreign
affairs from Peter Varkonyi, who has been named ambassador to
Washington; Csaba Hutter, head of a farming cooperative, takes over
agriculture; and financial expert Laszlo Bekesi moves to finance.
   The new ministers, whose names were published two weeks ago, are
expected to strengthen recent reforms and assist Nemeth in an
economic overhaul he said he will present later this month.
   The foreign debt of $17 billion remains the largest per capita
in the East bloc. With inflation expected to top 20 percent this
year, workers who have shown little interest in political reform
are unhappy and even official trade unions are demanding the
government ease its austerity drive.

   U.S. officials traveled to Israel last week
for talks on several unresolved matters concerning the case of
convicted spy Jonathan J. Pollard, Israeli and American sources
said.
   The team was led by Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis,
who heads the Justice Department's criminal division, and included
State Department representatives. It was accompanied by the No. 2
diplomat at the Israeli Embassy here, Oded Eran, said the sources,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The officials are trying to tie up loose ends remaining from the
affair, in which Pollard, an intelligence analyst for the U.S.
Navy, was convicted of selling thousands of secrets to Israel and
was sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment. His wife, Anne
Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced to five years in prison as an
accessory after the fact.
   The officials are trying to tie up loose ends remaining from the
affair, in which Pollard, an intelligence analyst for the U.S.
Navy, was convicted of selling thousands of secrets to Israel and
was sentenced in 1987 to life imprisonment. His wife, Anne
Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced to five years in prison as an
accessory after the fact.
   It could not be learned whether the U.S. team managed to resolve
the outstanding problems, although one official said he doubted the
case was now closed. ``It's been going on for so long and so
slowly, I doubt this trip is the end of the matter,'' this source
said Tuesday.
   A top aide to Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, Elyakim
Rubinstein, has held periodic talks in Washington in an effort to
close the case, which has been an embarrassment and strain for the
close ties between Israel and the United States.
   Last week's mission appears to be only the second time a U.S.
team has traveled to Israel to discuss the Pollard affair. The
first team went there in 1986 and was allowed to interview three of
Pollard's contacts who had worked at the Israeli Embassy and
consulate in Washington and New York.
   But the team, headed by former Justice Department prosecutor
Joseph DiGenova, claimed later the Israelis had not told them the
whole truth and had withheld information about the man who first
recruited Pollard in Washington, Aviem Sella.
   Sella was indicted here in 1987 and was forced to retire from
the Israeli air force because of U.S. pressure. The Justice
Department also threatened to revoke the immunity granted at the
time to the other three Israelis.
   U.S. officials also want Israel to return some of the documents
that Pollard supplied and which were not given back during the
initial phase of the investigation.
   Israel has contended the Pollard espionage operation was run by
Rafi Eitan, who headed an obscure Israeli defense bureau, without
authority from the government. It has apologized to the United
States but the affair continues to affect Israel's close
intelligence ties with the United States.

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas have moved up to
4,000 refugees closer to the heavily shelled Cambodian frontier,
evidently to stop relief agencies gaining greater access to them,
relief sources said today.
   During the first week of May, the communist guerrillas moved
3,000-4,000 refugees from Ta Luan camp eastward along a route
bombarded by artillery in April, the sources said.
   In front of relief officials, they loaded the refugees onto
Chinese-made military trucks along with their pigs and entire
households, said sources who spoke on condition of anonymity. Other
refugees walked. The 2,000 people left behind were mostly infirm or
handicapped.
   The guerrillas evidently fear they otherwise will lose control
over the refugees, whom the United Nations had planned to move to a
new camp where they could get medical and other services denied at
Ta Luan.
   ``They're obviously playing games with people's lives and with
us,'' one relief official said.
   The Chinese-armed Khmer Rouge is the largest guerrilla group
fighting Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in 1978 and ousted
it from power. The Khmer Rouge government had killed hundreds of
thousands of people in execution chambers and slave labor camps to
fashion a primitive agrarian society.
   Relief officials charge that guerrillas in Khmer Rouge refugee
camps regularly deny people emergency medical treatment, force
children to carry arms through minefields and execute disobedient
soldiers.
   Ta Luan is four miles inside Thailand's eastern Trat province,
and is among four Khmer Rouge-controlled border camps aided by the
U.N. Border Relief Operation. Relief officials said the Thai
military, crucial backers of the Khmer Rouge, do not seem anxious
to halt the movements from Ta Luan.
   Negotiations with guerrilla leaders have been ``very
frustrating,'' sources said. They quoted the guerrillas as saying
people must be moved because ``they are the soldiers' families and
the families must be with the soldiers.''
   The guerrillas have been increasingly isolated by the
international community as talks on ending the war have proceeded
rapidly in recent months. Khmer Rouge leaders have rejected all
peace proposals, and Western officials say they apparently have
made no attempts to end alleged human rights abuses.
   The Khmer Rouge moved about 7,000 people from Ta Luan to the
border area in November, apparently to populate strategic areas
inside Cambodia. Gunners inside Cambodia responded with heavy
shelling, reportedly inflicting numerous casualties and forcing
thousands of refugees back to the camp.
   Relief officials say Khmer Rouge guerrillas often isolate
refugees because they want to make sure the refugees are not
``polluted'' by Western influences and do not defect to
non-communist resistance groups.
   Thai officials this week criticized a letter in which 94 U.S.
congressmen asked that they take steps to end abuses in the camps,
facilitate access by aid officials, and allow refugees to move to
other camps. The officials and Thai legislsators accused the
congressmen of interfering in Thai affairs and insisted there are
no human rights violations in the camps.

   Frustrated by her Hollywood bosses, actress
Kelly McGillis is taking a holiday from her lucrative film career
and happily returning to the Shakespearean stage, where she'll play
some long-sought comedy roles.
   A comedian? Kelly McGillis? The gentle young Amish beauty whose
demure sensuality tempted Harrison Ford in ``Witness;'' the tough
district attorney in ``The Accused;'' the woman who had Tom Cruise
flying emotional barrel rolls in ``Top Gun?''
   ``I have good instincts and a good sense of timing,'' she says
quietly. ``I have a good sense of humor.''
   Miss McGillis will get her chance to display her comic talents
when she joins the acting company of the Shakespeare Theater at the
Folger for its four productions next season, which begins in
September.
   She will appear in two Shakespeare comedies, ``Twelfth Night''
and ``Merry Wives of Windsor,'' as well as ``The Tempest.'' She
also will play the title role in Friedrich von Schiller's tragic
drama, ``Mary Stuart.''
   She was interviewed over a late-morning breakfast at her hotel _
two poached eggs, whole wheat toast and cappuccino _ a few hours
before she attended the annual Helen Hayes Awards show Monday night
at the National Theater.
   She was nominated for _ but did not receive _ a best-actress
``Helen'' for her Portia in the Folger's production of ``Merchant
of Venice'' last year. The awards recognize outstanding
achievements in Washington's professional theater community.
   Miss McGillis is eagerly looking forward to her nine-month
sabbatical from the movie grind, partly because she'll be working
again with Michael Kahn, the Folger's artistic director. They first
met in 1979 when she was a drama student and he was a teacher at
the Juilliard School in New York.
   ``Michael knows my weaknesses and my strengths, and I think he
will push me to get better,'' she said.
   ``That's very difficult to find when you work in film, where you
only come together with a group of people for two or three months
and then you leave. With Michael there's a sense of continuity.
He's seen me and my work over the years.''
   She says she'll also enjoy staying close to her new husband,
California yacht broker Fred Tillman, whom she married last New
Year's Eve. They plan to live in a small rooming house near the
Folger with the nine other members of the theater's acting company.
   What are her strengths?
   ``Probably commitment, thoroughness and, I think, the ability to
work with other people. ... I really am an artist who truly
believes that what I do cannot be done without other people.
Theater is a communal art. We all need one another on that stage or
in that film.''
   Her biggest weakness? ``Confidence,'' she replies with a low
chuckle. She doesn't look insecure, she's told. ``Ah, but you don't
know me,'' she replies. ``I may be 5 foot 10 but inside I'm only 5
foot 1.''
   Miss McGillis says she is drawn to ``the poetry, the beauty of
language, the sense of period and style'' in Shakespeare's plays,
for which she was trained at Juilliard. She readily acknowledges
that her string of screen hits has made her wealthy enough to
afford the luxury of a low-paid season on the Folger stage.
   At 31, she can boast nearly a dozen movies plus an occasional
stage appearance. She refuses to be type-cast as the new Grace
Kelly, and says she plays ``a very unwholesome type of woman'' in
her latest film, ``Cat Chaser.''
   She complains, though, that Hollywood's play-it-safe producers
aren't willing to take a multimillion-dollar gamble and cast her in
comedies or classical drama. So her stint at the Folger, she says,
will ``really be a challenge and push me forward in a way that I
haven't allowed to do in films.''
   In her days as a single actress, Miss McGillis seduced Harrison
Ford in ``Witness'' with a convincing display of sexual fireworks.
Did she feel the same way when the cameras weren't rolling? she was
asked.
   ``He's not my type,'' she replied. ``Harrison's a nice man. I
don't look at him as a sex symbol. I look at him as an actor. He's
very charming, and he's very delightful to work with.''
   Did she ever have a crush on any leading man?
   ``Yes, I have, but I won't tell you which ones,'' she said,
laughing. ``It's none of your business.''

<TEXT>
   A six-story hotel going up closer to the
airport than expected because of a typographical error is
interfering with traffic controllers' radar, but a federal official
says flights are in no danger.
   The Federal Aviation Administration today sent a jet full of
computer equipment to fly around the Portland International JetPort
to find the gaps in coverage caused by the Quality Suites.
   ``We considered it urgent,'' FAA spokesman Michael Ciccarelli
said this morning, a day after 16 controllers brought the gaps to
the FAA's attention.
   The FAA blamed the problem on an error in plans submitted by the
hotel developers to the FAA for approval.
   ``They showed it 12,000 feet from the runway. It was actually
1,170 feet,'' said Jim Lucas, manager of the FAA's New England air
traffic division.
   However, Lucas said the airport is safe and that air traffic
routes could be changed if a serious enough problem is detected.
``I think any time we lose radar coverage, it's a problem, but we
have the ability to procedurally work around it,'' he said.
   The situation might be corrected by moving the radar, said
Cheryl Readio, local president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association.
   ``I don't think they'll knock down the hotel,'' she said.
``Somebody already goofed and allowed the hotel to be built.''
   She said local flights could fall out of the radar's sight, as
could planes coming in from Boston if they are flying under 6,000
feet.
   A spokesman for the air traffic controllers' union in Washington
characterized the gaps as serious.
   ``If you can imagine the radar, all of a sudden a big slice of
pie becomes dead,'' Tony Dresden said. ``They're starting to lose
things. It's about eight miles, which is a big chunk of space.''
   Dunfey Properties Inc. President Bob Dunfey Jr. said Tuesday the
hotel is being built according to plans signed by the FAA, and
Ciccarelli said the error was an ``innocent mistake.''
   ``We're not pointing the finger at anyone,'' he said.

   Thousands of students bicycled to major media and
government offices today to protest censorship, and officials
announced their first policy change in response to demands made in
nearly a month of pro-democracy protests.
   The Ministry of Supervision said today it will allow more open
news reporting of corruption cases, a move ``prompted by the recent
demands of Beijing University students to crack down on
corruption.''
   Today's protest by more than 5,000 students came a day after
government officials received a petition signed by more than 1,000
Chinese journalists seeking press freedom.
   Thousands of students in the northern city of Taiyuan also took
to the streets today in what the official Xinhua News agency
described as ``massive demonstrations.''
   Xinhua said the students held sit-ins in front of a hotel and
the headquarters of the Shanxi provincial government, demanding
dialogue with the governor. The two-sentence report gave no other
details.
   It was the first protest reported in Taiyuan, 260 miles
southwest of Beijing, since students in the capital began
demonstrating in mid-April.
   The Beijing demonstration was largely to support the
journalists' petition.
   ``We're riding bicycles today because we're too tired to walk,''
said a history student who attended four recent marches along the
10-mile route from the nation's top schools to Tiananmen Square
downtown.
   ``The road to democracy is very long,'' said a Tibetan student
from the Nationalities Institute. ``We are riding on bicycles to
get there faster.''
   About 1,000 protesters pedaled out of Beijing University, the
country's most prestigious, and were joined by students from about
six other schools.
   Protesters filled all six lanes of the street in front of their
first stop, China Central Television headquarters, and shouted
slogans critical of the government-controlled media.
   ``The People's Daily cheats the people!'' they chanted,
referring to the ruling Communist Party's official newspaper. ``The
press must speak the truth!'' they yelled.
   Many cyclists wore green, yellow and red headbands that read,
``Democracy, Freedom and Beijing University.''
   As the colorful procession passed major intersections lined with
workers, several students would raise both hands to flash the ``V''
for victory sign.
   Police, who in previous demonstrations tried to block
protesters, helped clear the way for the bicyclists as traffic
backed up for several miles. Some students distributed leaflets on
buses that urged, ``Liberate the press.''
   After the rally outside the TV headquarters, the protesters
moved to the main office of state-run Xinhua News Agency and later
to police headquarters, where they chanted: ``Thank you police, for
working for the people.''
   On its way to the People's Daily, the party mouthpiece, the
procession's loose organization gave way to some disorder when it
ran into rush-hour traffic.
   At the People's Daily, several thousand people gathered outside
and cheered as the students inched by. A group of about 50 writers
and poets also joined the protest march. By evening, the students
were on their way home.
   Cyclists carried a statement protesting ``government delays
toward the students request for a dialogue'' and demanding ``that
as soon as possible the government hold a true, open dialogue that
will resolve problems of concern to the broad masses of people.''
   The government has refused to meet with independent student
groups established over the past month.
   At the front of the leisurely paced procession were students
traveling by three-wheel pedicart who held high a banner that said,
``The press must speak the truth.''
   A free press is a major demand of university students who since
mid-April have staged the largest demonstrations in Communist
China's 40-year history. ``Early this week we were tired, but now
we are ready to fight again,'' said one history student from
Beijing University, a campus of more than 10,000.
   The last mass march was Thursday, when tens of thousands of
people poured into Tiananmen Square _ the country's symbolic seat
of power _ to celebrate the 70th anniversary of China's first
student movement.
   The bicycle procession was organized by Beijing University,
where sentiment to maintain the pro-democracy movement is strongest.
   When other schools decided to end a two-week class boycott over
the weekend, Beijing University students immediately voted to
continue the strike to apply pressure on the government to respond
to their demands.

   China and Vietnam, backers of rival forces in the
Cambodian war, failed to make progress at talks to end the
10-year-old war, the official Xinhua News Agency reported today.
   Three days of talks between Vietnam's Deputy Foreign Minister
Dinh Nho Liem and his Chinese counterpart, Liu Shuqing, ended today.
   ``We had hoped for some progress toward a fair and reasonable
settlement of the Cambodian issue and it's a pity that the
consultations have made no progress and achieved no
understanding,'' the agency quoted Chinese Foreign Minister Qian
Qichen as saying.
   Qian, who also met Dinh, said China's relations with Vietnam
will improve only after the Cambodian conflict is resolved.
   Vietnamese sources said the talks ``contributed to mutual
understanding.''
   Relations have been strained since China launched a 20-day
border war against Vietnam in early 1979 to punish Hanoi for its
invasion of Cambodia.
   China is the main backer of the anti-Vietnamese resistance
battling Vietnamese troops and forces of the Hun Sen government
Hanoi installed in Phnom Penh.
   The sources said the two sides agreed on previous positions that
China will stop aid to the resistance after Vietnam withdraws its
estimated 50,000 to 70,000 troops from Cambodia.
   Hanoi has said it will pull out all troops by the end of
September.
   The sources also reiterated their broad agreement on the need
for international supervision of the withdrawal, that the future
government in Cambodia should be non-aligned and neutral and that
an international conference on Cambodia be convened as soon as
possible.
   The two sides still differed on the composition of a proposed
coalition government to be formed after the Vietnamese depart, the
sources said.
   The resistance, led by Prince Norodom Sihanouk, has called for
the Hun Sen government to be dismantled before a coalition is
formed, an idea rejected by Vietnam and Phnom Penh.
   Vietnam also has refused to accept Sihanouk's call for U.N.
supervision of the troop withdrawal.
   The meeting was the second following a secret visit by Dinh to
Beijing in January for the first high-level contacts between the
two countries in more than nine years.
   Both sides agreed today the consultations should continue, but
did not set a date for the next meeting.
   Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia ended the brutal regime of the
Khmer Rouge, which in its campaign to turn the country into an
agrarian commune caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of
people through execution and starvation.
   The Dinh visit comes just one week before Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev arrives in Beijing for the first Sino-Soviet summit in
30 years. China is critical of the Soviet Union for supporting
Vietnam's military presence in Cambodia, and the Cambodian question
is expected to be discussed in detail during Gorbachev's visit.

   Soldiers shot to death a Palestinian in the
occupied lands today, Arab reports said. U.N. officials accused
troopers of harassing medical crews trying to evacuate wounded
Palestinians during weekend clashes.
   The West Bank and Gaza Strip were sealed for the third day to
prevent violence as Israel celebrated the 41st anniversary of its
founding.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was hospitalized for medical tests
after complaining of weakness, spokesman Yossi Ahimeir said.
Ahimeir said Shamir stumbled and hit his head at his home Tuesday
night.
   ``He felt weakness a little bit, and his doctors decided he
should be hospitalized for checks,'' Ahimeir said. ``There appears
to be nothing serious.''
   Shamir made several public appearances today before he was taken
to a Jerusalem hospital at about noon, Ahimeir said. Shamir, 73,
has attended more than a half-dozen events since Tuesday night to
mark the Israeli holiday.
   Earlier, Shamir said only Palestinians who do not insist on
eventual creation of a Palestinian state will be acceptable
negotiating partners with Israel.
   Shamir has called for elections in the occupied lands to choose
representatives who would negotiate an interim arrangement with
Israel on limited Palestinian self-rule.
   ``We can't talk with the PLO because their minimum demand is a
Palestinian state. We can't agree to this,'' Shamir told Israel
radio. ``Therefore we have to talk to people who are interested in
a solution ... those who don't insist on this minimum demand for a
Palestinian state.''
   The PLO and leading Palestinians have rejected Shamir's plan.
   According to Arab reports, the worst violence today was in the
West Bank town of Ramallah, where troops opened fire to disperse
about 200 Palestinians throwing stones.
   A 17-year-old Palestinian, identified as Mahoud Sami Abdul
Ranni, arrived dead at Ramallah Hospital with a gunshot wound in
the chest, hospital officials said. One youth was wounded in the
clash.
   The death brought to 468 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 17-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. Twenty-one Israelis have died.
   In the Gaza Strip, four Palestinians were wounded by army
gunfire in clashes in Gaza City and the Nuseirat refugee camp,
hospital officials said.
   The army said it was checking the reports.
   The army maintained a curfew on the Gaza Strip, confining
700,000 Palestinians to their homes. About 200,000 West Bank
residents were also under curfew, and all 1 million West Bank Arabs
were barred from entering Israel for the holiday marking the
anniversary of Israel's establishment on May 14, 1948.
   The U.N. Relief and Works Agency, meanwhile, complained to the
army that soldiers hampered the work of its medical crews Saturday
when troops fatally shot three Palestinians and wounded dozens of
others in the Gaza Strip.
   ``There have been problems with (stopping) ambulances from time
to time, but we have never had so many incidents as on Saturday,''
said a Western U.N. official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   In a statement issued in Vienna, the agency said ``ambulances
carrying injured persons were repeatedly stopped and searched by
the Israeli military.''
   Army officials said they could not immediately comment on the
report by the agency. The agency was set up in 1949 to care for
Palestinians made refugees at the founding of Israel.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was hospitalized
for medical tests today after he stumbled and hit his head at home
and complained of weakness, his spokesman said.
   Shamir was taken to Hadassah Hospital at about noon, said Shamir
spokesman Yossi Ahimeir.
   Shamir walked into a piece of furniture in his Jerusalem home on
Tuesday night, and ``in the darkness, he hit his head,'' Ahimeir
said.
   Shamir today ``felt weakness a little bit, and his doctors
decided he should be hospitalized for checks,'' Ahimeir said.
``There appears to be nothing serious.''
   Ahimeir said he expected Shamir to be released later today or
Thursday.
   A hospital security guard barred an Associated Press reporter
from entering the hospital, saying the hospital spokeswoman was not
in her office. The spokeswoman's home telephone went unanswered.
   Shamir, 73, has been at more than a half dozen events since
Tuesday night to mark two successive Israeli holidays, Memorial Day
and Independence Day.
   Earlier today, he visited an immigrant center at Mevasseret Zion
on the outskirts of Jerusalem and attended the annual Bible Quiz in
Jerusalem.
   He has been at the center of political debates for several
months as the government works out a peace proposal that it hopes
will quiet the 17-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Ahimeir said Shamir has no past history of major medical
problems. ``He is absolutely healthy,'' he said.
   The Polish-born Shamir, who is head of the right-wing Likud
bloc, first became prime minister in 1983 after Prime Minister
Menachem Begin resigned.
   Shamir was succeeded in 1984 by his political rival, Labor Party
leader Shimon Peres, but in a rotation agreement between the two
parties resumed power in 1986. He was re-elected to head the
coalition government in November.

   The Journal-Bulletin, Providence, R.I., on Yasser Arafat:
   Yasser Arafat's public relations campaign is in full swing, and
(last) week he found himself in Paris, received by President
Mitterrand of France.
   This is, of course, a significant breakthrough for the head of
the Palestine Liberation Organization: Recognition by the French
head of state is exactly the sort of ammunition the PLO requires in
its diplomatic campaign.
   It is a step or two above the American decision _ long overdue
... to talk to the principal voice of the Palestinian people. ...
   Arafat did tell the French that he explicitly disavows the old
PLO charter, a provision of which calls for the destruction of
Israel.
   That is real progress. Now, if ... Arafat will take action
against these internecine killings, he may lend some real substance
to his diplomatic status.

   Daily News, Los Angeles, on Iranian ``moderates'':
   When ex-National Security Adviser Robert C. McFarlane and Oliver
North, then a National Security Council aide, flew to Iran in May
1986 to exchange military parts covertly for American hostages,
more than an arms-for-hostages deal was supposedly at stake.
   The other goal _ or so President Reagan later claimed _ was to
increase contacts with so-called Iranian moderates, who presumably
would improve relations with the United States and soften Iran's
brutal government after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
   One of the ``moderates'' who administration officials had long
hoped would produce a diplomatic breakthrough was Hashemi
Rafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, who was endorsed
Sunday by departing President Ali Khamenei as his successor. ...
   On Friday, the ``moderate'' Rafsanjani urged Palestinians to
kill Americans and their Western allies to avenge Arabs killed in
the 17 months of rioting in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip. He recommended that for every Palestinian killed in the
uprising, five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen be assassinated. ...
   Rafsanjani has shown, unfortunately, that he's more than ready
to carry on in the Khomeini tradition.

   The Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette on the Oliver North verdict:
   The Reagan administration's place in U.S. history was further
cemented (May 4) by the conviction of Oliver North, Ronald Reagan's
idea of ``a national hero.''
   The guilty verdict was more than a finding against one White
House agent on three specific violations. It will be seen around
the globe as a judgment against CIA-style covert wars.
   When the president attempted to overthrow tiny Nicaragua, hiding
the operation from the American people, he broke the first rule of
democracy: that the people decide their nation's actions. The
concealment failed, and America was dishonored in the eyes of most
of the human race. The World Court found America guilty of
treaty-breaking.
   For years, the Kremlin and its KGB sponsored surrogate wars in
other nations. We hope (the North) verdict helps terminate
America's participation in this ugly practice.

   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Oliver North verdict:
   Oliver L. North really believed in his covert mission of helping
the Nicaraguan rebels who were struggling against the Communist
Sandinista government which runs the country. We're persuaded that
he thought what he was doing was the right thing to do. ...
   But he violated the law. He lied to people in authority. He
deceived Congress. Even when persons are loyal and well-meaning,
that is no excuse for deceit that violates the law.
   The jury in the North trial obviously had a tough time coming to
a decision. Jury members deliberated painfully over 12 days before
reaching their verdict; not guilty of nine of the charges against
him but guilty of shredding documents, of accepting payment for the
$13,800 security system installed at his home and of destroying and
falsifying records and aiding and abetting the obstruction of
Congress. As we recall, North conceded as much during the trial.
   While North now faces substantial penalties _ at worst, 10 years
in prison and fines totaling $750,000 _ we suspect his sentence
will be much lighter, and in our view it should be.
   We're convinced North was not working on his won. Despite the
denials of former President Ronald Reagan and President George
Bush, we suspect they knew what North was doing. So did CIA
Director William Casey, now dead. Certainly that mitigates North's
wrongdoing.

   Capital Journal, Pierre, S.D., on the Oliver North verdict:
   We ... believe that while an appeal from the (Oliver North)
verdict might result in reversing the conviction on those three
counts, President Bush should spare the taxpayers and Lt. Col.
North of any further expensive litigation by promptly issuing a
pardon. ...
   This would not be full compensation for the indignity to which
he and his family have been subjected during the past year, but at
least it would recognize the validity of his assertion that there
was no criminal intent on his part and that he believed the orders
he received from his superiors were lawful.

   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on the federal budget agreement:
   President Bush describes the budget agreement he reached
recently with congressional leaders as ``a first manageable step''
toward solving the nation's deficit problem.
   What he and congressional leaders don't say is that the step was
manageable only because it was so small.
   Although the accord nominally meets the 1990 Gramm-Rudman
deficit target, it does so through the use of rosy scenarios and
accounting flimflam, leaving the real deficit virtually untouched.
   By now, the devices of budget fudging are drearily familiar.
Faced with the task of reducing the deficit from $163 billion, the
estimate for the current year, to the required $100 billion, the
negotiators first agreed to assume that the economy will grow
faster, with lower inflation and interest rates, than any private
forecaster dares predict. That cut the problem in half.
   Then came the usual accounting evasions: Assume $500 million in
new revenues from unspecified Internal Revenue Service actions;
``save'' $2.2 billion in postal spending by moving the Postal
Service off budget; ``cut'' farm support programs by $900 million
by making October payments to farmers in September, a move that
saves taxpayers no money but shifts the spending out of the coming
budget year onto this year's account; require changes in law that
will yield $5.3 billion in new revenue without being viewed as new
taxes.
   Using this smoke and mirrors technique, Congress and the
president will pretend to have done their job.

   Dallas Times Herald on the FSX deal:
   President Bush's decision to proceed with the co-development of
the FSX fighter for the Japanese air force may be economically
sound in the short term.
   But it's difficult to justify the deal on a long-term basis,
because it gives Japan commercial and military technology it has
been unable to develop and which it will use to build a competitive
aerospace industry. ...
   Bush was right to discard some aspects of the deal set by
President Reagan, and to ensure that U.S. firms receive at least 40
percent of the production revenues. But that does not correct the
basic flaw in the transaction _ providing crucial technology to
assist Japan in developing a competing industry.
   Congress should reject this pact and let Japan try to compete
alone. ...
   There are three drawbacks:
   _ The agreement ... is not binding like a contract or a treaty.
Development of the FSX will not necessarily provide jobs. ...
   _ The administration is providing the Japanese with the basic
source codes for the craft's armaments system, though the Japanese
will have to develop their own high performance weapons and
interlocking operational software. This is excessively generous. ...
   _ Bush asserts U.S. firms will share in the development of
phased-array radar systems and high-performance composite wing
material. What he overlooks is the Japanese do not have these
items. The radar is the domain of Texas Instruments, E-Systems and
other U.S. firms. And the aircraft giants such as GD, Lockheed, and
McDonnell-Douglass pioneered composites.
   It's not likely the Japanese, in the next decade, can surpass
the existing lead of U.S. firms and the advances they are sure to
develop. So there will be no Japanese gains in which American firms
reasonably can share.
   Aviation experts do not believe the Japanese can create the
world's most demanding technological machines in the next decade.
For that reason, it would be preferable to let the Japanese go it
alone rather than provide the tools to boost them to the top.

   Independent, Marshall, Minn., on new ethics legislation:
   The Integrity in Post-Employment Act of 1989 has been introduced
in Congress by Rep. Craig T. James, R-Fla.
   It is a good bill, designed to help restore integrity and
honesty to service in Congress and throughout the federal
government. It should sail through Congress, but probably won't.
   The honor that once graced government service no longer exists,
disappearing in a pattern of abuse by public officials at every
level. The problems are rampant and have been festering for years.
Elected officials have lost their commitment to the values of
honesty and integrity and accountability.
   Significant changes in current federal laws will be required to
correct the present flawed system of ethics. Dishonest and
unethical behavior cannot be legislated away, of course, but laws
can be put into place that would close the potential avenues of
corruption as well as severely punish those who are corrupt.
   James' legislation would do that. The essence of his proposal is
simple: It establishes an equality of ethical rules for all
branches of government. For far too long, Congress has demanded
high ethical standards from others while exempting itself from even
the most perfunctory ones.

   Seattle Post-Intelligencer on flight attendants' work periods:
   This week a House subcommittee will hold hearings on a topic
that ought to interest every airline passenger: the length of work
periods required of airline flight attendants.
   A bill sponsored by Rep. Norman Y. Mineta, D-Calif., would set
limits on the number of consecutive hours flight attendants must
work.
   As it now stands, flight attendants are the only crew members
not covered by Federal Aviation Administration regulations to limit
work hours, and they have been known to be required to work 24-hour
shifts. Since the FAA requires the flight attendants to be aboard
for safety reasons, the rationale for this oversight is hard to
figure.
   In an emergency, passengers depend for their safety on the
alertness and quick response of cabin attendants. A cabin attendant
who is exhausted from long flights and quick turnarounds with no
rest break is a potential safety hazard to passengers. ...
   Protecting flight attendants from exploitation that hampers
their performance is public interest legislation that deserves
speedy enactment.

   The Wichita (Kan.) Eagle-Beacon on crack's impact on children:
   When children's advocate David Liederman addressed members of
the Kansas Children's Service League last week, he emphasized the
dire consequences to children and families that result from drug
abuse, particularly crack cocaine.
   The strong correlation between substance abuse _ especially
crack _ and escalating rates of child abuse and neglect is
convincing and deeply troubling.
   Current federal priorities, sadly, help assure that children who
don't even smoke crack will remain its front-line victims. ...
   The federal government, if it is truly serious about the war on
drugs, must devote more spending on programs that help
drug-afflicted children and families. Without assistance from a
benevolent government, children of crack addicts may well consider
themselves America's unloved and unwanted.

   The Daily Astorian, Astoria, Ore., on the spotted owl
controversy:
   For anyone who has followed Northwest timber politics for more
than a few years the current hullabaloo over the northern spotted
owl has a familiar ring. ... We have heard these kinds of
prophecies of doom before.
   The likelihood that the Fish and Wildlife Service will list the
owl as a threatened species has given license to industry's hit
men. ...
   The aspect of the timber industry's grumbling that gets a little
tiresome is the implicit attitude that everyone else must give way
in favor of its economic demands. That attitude becomes especially
galling when you review the industry's historically favored
position in the federal tax code or its subsidies. ...
   It is no secret that a number of companies have overcut their
Northwest lands. ...
   The industry has already sent more than 60 times as many raw
logs overseas to be cut by Japanese and other foreign sawmills as
are in jeopardy because of the spotted owl.

cheated the Internal Revenue Service of earnings from gambling.
He's broke from gambling debts.

   New speculation sprouts daily. Many want Rose to quit his job
and leave baseball.
   But after 10 weeks or more of investigation by the IRS and
baseball Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti, the goods to nail Pete
Rose are still missing. Nothing's happened, except for a very
public trial by innuendo.
   If there's evidence linking Rose to illegal gambling, it should
be disclosed, pronto. If there's no case against the man, he
deserves public vindication _ and apologies _ from his accusers.

<HEAD>Exxon Vows to Boost Oil Spill Cleanup Effort</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Assoicated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., under prodding from the Bush
administration, announced today it plans to sharply increase the
number of workers and ships cleaning spilled oil from more than 300
miles of Alaska shoreline.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner called the move ``a
substantial increase'' in manpower and resources by Exxon and said
it improves the likelihood that the oil company will meet its
cleanup goals for this summer.
   Nevertheless, said Skinner, the cleanup effort might still have
to be continued in the spring of 1990. Exxon said it is confident
it can clean the shoreline by September with the added manpower and
ships.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William
Sound on March 24, spilling nearly 11 million gallons into the
pristine waters of the sound. Within days the oil spread down the
southern Alaska coast causing environmental and economic havoc.
   The Coast Guard estimates that more than 300 miles of rocky
shoreline needs to be cleaned by hand and high-powered water hoses.
In recent weeks, cleanup efforts have proven to be much more
difficult than Exxon had expected on the soiled shoreline of Smith
Island, which was particularly hard hit.
   In a revised cleanup plan submitted to the Coast Guard, Exxon
said it will increase the number of people to be involved in the
summer cleanup from a previously planned 3,400 workers to 5,000. It
also said it will bring in seven additional barges and 17 more
landing craft, bringing the number of vessels to 70.
   The additional manpower and vessels ``will allow the number of
people directly employed on the battlefront _ on the shoreline _ to
increase by over 1,000 from 1,475 to 2,500,'' William D. Stevens,
president of Exxon Co. U.S.A. said in a statement.
   Exxon executives met with Skinner and John Sununu, President
Bush's chief of staff, at the White House on Monday and were told
their earlier cleanup plan was inadequate to meet the company's
announced cleanup goals, officials said.
   Coast Guard Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins told Exxon officials in a
letter Monday that additional manpower was needed. He said in light
of the problems Exxon has had with cleaning up Smith Island, he was
``seriously concerned that the investment of resources you
described (earlier) will not be able to clean the 300-plus miles of
shoreline in the time allotted.''
   Robbins said Exxon's cleanup plan was ``well designed'' but that
the company needed to ``substantially increase'' its workforce with
an aim at quickening the rate of beach cleanup.
   Exxon and the federal government has been under sharp criticism
for its lack of coordination and pace of the cleanup in the first
few weeks after the spill. Since then, the Coast Guard gradually
has assumed increased oversight in the effort, although the actual
work and development of cleanup plans continue largely to be in
Exxon hands.
   ``Exxon has acknowledged that they need to do more, and the
substantial increase in manpower and resources described today will
allow them to accelerate the pace of the cleanup,'' Skinner said in
a statement.

   Joseph Boatner, a later member of the

   Boatner died Monday in Lakes Region General Hospital in Laconia
after a brief illness.
   Boatner joined the soft rhythm 'n' blues quartet in 1952, after
the group reached its heyday in the 1930s and '40s. All four of its
original members are dead, but Boatner once said, ``I'm the closest
you get to an original.''
   The original group, considered one of the early influences on
rock 'n' roll, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in
January. They made their fame with songs like ``Java Jive'' and
``If I Didn't Care.''
   Born in Lovejoy, Ill., Boatner graduated from the Conservatory
of Music in Cleveland.
   He once said his ambition had been to be a doctor. ``I sought
admission to two black medical schools, but both were filled. Due
to segregated practices back then, I couldn't get into the white
schools,'' he said.
   Survivors include his wife, a daughter, a stepson and
stepdaughter, and five grandchildren.

<HEAD>WHO Postpones Vote on PLO Membership Until Friday</HEAD>

   The annual assembly of the World Health
Organization today put off for 48 hours a decision on the PLO's
controversial bid to be admitted as a state member of the
166-nation U.N. body.
   Failure by the Arab countries to obtain an immediate vote
boosted hopes of those favoring a compromise to head off a showdown
with the United States.
   Washington has threatened to stop all financial support to any
U.N. agency that grants full membership to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which now is a non-voting observer in the United
Nations.
   The United States made that threat even though it reveresed a
longstanding policy earlier this year and opened talks with the PLO
after it's chairman, Yasser Arafat, recognized Israel's right to
exist.
   On Friday, the WHO annual assembly will vote on two rival draft
resolutions:
   One, co-sponsored by all 21 Arab countries, would ``admit the
State of Palestine'' as a member of the 166-nation organization.
   The other, backed by nine Western and Third World states, would
combine deferring the issue until the 1990 assembly with calls for
increased assistance to residents of the Israeli-occupied Gaza
Strip and West Bank.
   An Austrian motion to adjourn the debate until Friday, seconded
by Canada, was carried by 56-47 votes with 20 abstentions. Bahrain,
seconded by Libya, opposed adjourning.
   The Western and Third World resolution invites the assembly to
express the hope ``that the Palestinian people will be fully
represented within the WHO by their legitimate representatives.''
   That language apparently is addressed at developing countries
that sympathize with the PLO but are worried by WHO
Director-General Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima's warning that a cutoff of
U.S. funds would ``completely destroy the agency.'' The United
States funds a quarter of the organization's budget and this year
contributed $71 million.
   WHO plays a vital role in assisting governments worldwide to
strengthen their health services and advance work to eradicate
diseases, such as AIDS, and to promote health care and nutrition.
   Washington and its Western allies say the PLO-declared ``State
of Palestine'' does not fulfill internationally accepted criteria
of statehood, including control of a defined territory.
   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III also has says PLO
admission would harm the Middle East peace process and the entire
U.N. system.
   But the PLO seems determined to push its bid throughout the U.N.
system, with support of nearly 100 of the 159 member states that
have recognized the State of Palestine or acknowledged its
proclamation.
   On Tuesday, the PLO announced in Paris that it will seek
admission to three more U.N. bodies: the Paris-based U.N.
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, the Rome-based
Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Geneva-based
International Labor Organization.
   The International Labor Organization probably will be the next
target because its annual conference opens June 7. Admission,
however, would require a two-thirds majority while a simple
majority suffices in the WHO assembly.
   The United States, which withdrew from the International Labor
Organization from 1977 to 1980 to protest what it charged was
growing politicization, pays one-fourth of its budget of $357
million for fiscal 1988-89.

   A gunman killed his ex-wife and then commandeered
a small plane and swooped over Boston for three hours, strafing
Logan Airport and firing at baseball fans leaving Fenway Park,
authorities said today.
   Alfred James Hunter III awaited arraignment today on charges of
murdering his former wife, Elvira, in front of their 5-year-old son
Tuesday night.
   The 42-year-old licensed pilot took to the skies after the
slaying in an aerial shooting spree during which he buzzed the
control tower at Logan four times before landing with just five
minutes' worth of fuel, authorities said.
   ``The fourth time ... the controllers were directed to literally
vacate the tower and relocate to the radar room until further
notice,'' said Michael Ciccarelli, a spokesman for the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   No injuries were reported from the shots fired from the plane.
   Trooper Barbara Bennett said authorities decided to track the
two-seat Cessna by radar from the ground and wait for it to run out
of fuel instead of sending a helicopter after it because ``you'd be
a sitting duck in the air.''
   ``There was a high degree of frustration for authorities on the
ground, but it wouldn't have made sense to go up after him,''
Bennett said.
   Hunter's flight took him over the Kenmore Square neighborhood,
where the Boston Red Sox had just finished a game. Police found two
shell casings nearby. He also flew under a bridge over Boston
Harbor and buzzed several other neighborhoods and the post office
where he worked, authorities said.
   ``He kept dive-bombing it there,'' said Richard Serino, a deputy
superintendent of Boston Emergency Medical Services. ``The people
were saying it looked like he was going to crash, then he pulled up
and did a couple of turns.''
   Hunter was captured peacefully when he landed at the airport
shortly after 1 a.m. No weapons were found. Police said they did
not know how many shots were fired from the plane. Two casings and
two live shells were in the aircraft.
   The trouble began in Danvers, 30 miles north of Boston, when
Hunter shot his ex-wife three times at her home with a rifle in
front of their son, Steven, said Danvers police Sgt. Richard
Landers. Trooper Mark Lynch said the couple, divorced two years
ago, had appeared in court Tuesday, but he declined to say why.
   Hunter's wife was believed to be in her mid-30s.
   After the shooting, Hunter fled in his van, tried but failed to
wave a car down with his gun and then stole a car at gunpoint at a
restaurant in Peabody.
   The car owner told police Hunter was carrying an assault rifle.
Lynch said the casings recovered might have come from an AK-47 or
another large-caliber weapon.
   Hunter drove the stolen car to an airport in Beverly, where he
took the plane, Landers said. Robert Golder, a 21-year-old flight
instructor, said Hunter, wielding a rifle, ordered him to start the
plane and leave the cockpit.
   ``He told me not to do anything stupid. He said he had just
killed some people,'' Golder said. He said he headed back to the
airport with his back to the man.
   ``I thought about running. I thought about dropping to the
ground. I just walked calmly,'' he said.
   At one point, 10 rounds were fired at a Continental Airlines jet
that was on the ground at Logan but missed the plane and a mechanic
working underneath, said FAA agent Stacy Grace. Shots ricocheted
off the runway and a building, she said.
   Airports across Massachusetts and in New Hampshire were alerted,
said Trooper Byron Rizos.
   A man showed police a shell casing he said had fallen from the
sky and struck him. One other casing was found nearby. ``There's no
question it's from the plane,'' said Robert Hayden, deputy police
superintendent.

<HEAD>Group of Soviet Jews Calls for Preserving Jackson-Vanik Amendment</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Baker, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Police broke up a demonstration today by about 40
Soviet Jews calling on the United States to keep denying
most-favored-nation trading status to the Soviet Union as long as
limits on emigration remain.
   The half-hour protest outside Moscow's International Trade
Center came on the first day of Secretary of State James Baker's
visit to Moscow, and at least four of the demonstrators were to
meet later in the evening with Baker at the U.S. Embassy, protest
organizer Yuri Semenovsky said.
   Many in the group, which stood on the pedestal of a statue of
Mercury, the Roman god of trade, carried banners calling on the
U.S. government to maintain the 1972 Jackson-Vanik amendment. The
measure bars trade concessions to communist states unless the
president can state that he has received assurances that emigration
will be liberalized.
   ``I wait for permission to leave the U.S.S.R. for 10 years,''
another protest sign read. ``Mr. Vanik, we are still here!'' said
another.
   Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union rose in April to its
highest level since 1979, with 4,129 Soviet Jews allowed to leave,
according to the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration, which helps emigres resettle.
   Charles Vanik, no longer in Congress, called May 4 for waiving
the restrictions he had co-sponsored for one year, saying such
action would encourage further human rights improvements in the
Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. But Semenovsky
claimed it was misleading to look only at the emigration figures.
   ``The Soviets say only 1 percent to 3 percent of those who want
to leave are refused permission'' he said. ``But that's only the
tip of the iceberg. Many others want to leave but are afraid to
apply, or the government will not accept their applications.''
   Semenovsky, leader of a refusenik group called ``Poor
Relatives,'' said the Jackson-Vanik amendment should not be
repealed until the Soviet Union passes a law allowing anyone who
wants to to emigrate. He claimed that 100,000 people were refused
permission last year.
   Uniformed police and KGB agents in plainclothes surrounded the
protesters and forced them off the statue's pedestal after a local
government official announced through a bullhorn that the
demonstration was illegal.
   Although police placed their hands on some protesters' shoulders
to make them leave, there were no arrests or violence.

<HEAD>Largest Gator On Record in Florida: 1,043-pounder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trapper harpooned the biggest
alligator on record in Florida _ a 13-foot, 10{-inch reptile that
weighed in at 1,043 pounds.
   Biologists needed a tow truck to maneuver the gator onto three
scales.
   Licensed trapper Columbus White hauled the gator out of a lake
April 17 because patrons of a fish camp 10 miles from Gainesville
felt threatened, the Florida Game and Freshwater Fish Commission
said Tuesday.
   ``We occasionally get reports of gators longer than 14 feet, but
this was the longest and heaviest one ever officially measured in
Florida,'' said Woody Woodward, a biologist with the agency.
   It took three hours to land the alligator, White said.
   The gator produced 294 pounds of meat and 15 feet of hide with a
combined wholesale value of about $2,500, Woodward said.
   Two days later, a game officer trapped the largest bear ever
captured in the commission's nuisance bear program. The 475-pound
black bear had been destroying beehives in the Florida Panhandle.
   It was too big for a standard trap, so a game officer baited it
with honey laced with a tranquilizer. The bear was later released
in the area because it was not considered a menace to people.
   Before it regained consciousness, a tooth was pulled to check
the bear's age and discourage the animal from returning to the
hives by making him associate the capture and toothache with the
site, said biologist Steve Shea.

   The Justice Department said today it will
launch its own review of House Speaker Jim Wright's conduct after
the House completes its ethics investigation of the congressional
leader.
   At the same time, Wright's new eight-lawyer defense team was
filing a series of legal motions aimed at combatting the 69 formal
charges against the Texas Democrat, and the House ethics committee
is considering whether to expand its case against the speaker.
   ``I expect the department will take an independent look,'' said
David Runkel, spokesman for Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. The
department would review matters brought up by the House ethics
committee and ``other matters that have been raised,'' such as
Wright's involvement in a 1985 political fund-raising effort in
Texas, he said.
   Runkel said the department's review of Wright's conduct will
begin after the House has completed its ethics process and
regardless of the outcome on Capitol Hill.
   Wright escalated the battle Tuesday, saying his legal team has
been ``profoundly shocked by the lack of professionalism and the
prevalence of distortion and inaccuracy'' in the report by the
ethics committee's outside counsel, Chicago lawyer Richard J.
Phelan.
   And Wright told reporters the committee had been ``totally
dependent on Mr. Phelan's interpretation and his summary of the
investigation'' in charging him with wrongdoing.
   On allegations that his wife didn't work for her $18,000-a-year
salary on the payroll of Fort Worth developer George Mallick,
Wright said the report was ``a lie, a falsehood, a distortion and a
misrepresentation of the testimony.''
   Ethics panel members, however, dismissed the harsh attack as a
defense gambit. ``I'm glad you recognize that is the strategy,''
chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., said when asked about the defense
attacks.
   Dixon and other committee members said Wright's complaint was
unfounded because they had thoroughly read transcripts of the
panel's witness interviews and examined underlying evidence in
reaching their conclusions.
   ``I think the committee has done its homework very well,'' said
Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, a panel member.
   The ethics committee was meeting today to consider whether to
file additional charges against Wright stemming from a lucrative
1988 Texas gas drilling venture, and whether to investigate further
a list of other issues that have arisen in news media reports in
recent weeks.
   Dixon said the committee also has asked for transcripts and
other documents from the Texas fraud trial of three savings and
loan executives, where Wright's name surfaced in testimony last
week.
   Although Wright is not directly involved in the trial, it raised
anew the issue of whether he tried to exert improper influence on
behalf of the S&amp;L industry. The ethics committee already has looked
at similar questions but did not bring charges.
   ``We just can't get our platter cleared off before more is piled
onto it,'' said Rep. John T. Myers of Indiana, the panel's senior
Republican.
   In defense motions filed Tuesday, Wright's lawyers asked for
access to committee documents and witnesses and sought to bar
private contact between the committee and Phelan, who has served
thus far as a staff member to the panel.
   ``Clearly, the risk is great that ... the committee will be
biased by hearing only one side of the story or by hearing one side
under exceptionally favorable circumstances,'' stated one of the
motions.
   Further motions were being prepared asking that the most serious
charges against Wright be dismissed because, the defense contends,
they are based on a faulty reading of House rules. The motions all
must be ruled on by the ethics committee.
   ``I think Mr. Wright will be totally cleared in any fair trial
before his peers,'' said Stephen D. Susman, a Houston trial lawyer
among those brought in to bolster the speaker's defense team.
   Wright is charged in 69 counts with evading House limits on
outside earned income through bulk sales of a book he wrote, and
with improperly accepting some $145,000 in gifts from Mallick, who
the committee has deemed had a direct interest in legislation
before Congress.
   But Wright's attorneys argued that a strict reading of the rules
permits House members to collect unlimited book royalties. They
also sought to make the case that Mallick had no direct interest in
legislation as defined by the rules, and therefore any ``gifts''
from him to the Wrights would be acceptable.
   The lawyers contended Phelan misread the history behind the
rules and brought charges when none were warranted. Phelan's
charges amount to a rewriting of the rules, the defense lawyers
said.

<HEAD>Crops Suffer from Drought in Some Areas, Too Much Rain in Others</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some farmers are stuck in the mud, others wish
it would rain enough to create some muddy fields.
   Crops continued to suffer in major areas of the Great Plains
while too much rain slowed spring planting in the eastern Corn Belt
and the Southeast, the government's Joint Agricultural Weather
Facility reported Tuesday.
   Nationally, winter wheat was in mostly fair-to-poor condition
during the week of May 1-7, although the Great Plains crop was
rated below that. In the Pacific Northwest, Corn Belt and
Southeast, winter wheat was in ``mostly good to fair'' shape.
   The report said 89 percent of the winter wheat crop in Kansas
was in very poor or poor condition ``and continued to deteriorate
due to lack of moisture'' during the week.
   But ``cool, wet weather reduced crop stress in Oklahoma,'' where
wheat was reported in mostly fair condition. Lack of moisture
continued to hurt the crop in Colorado and Nebraska.
   Harvesting of the 1989 winter wheat crop has begun in southern
Texas and will gradually move north. The Agriculture Department
will issue its first official estimate of this year's production on
Thursday.
   Meanwhile, the facility, which is operated jointly by USDA and
the Commerce Department, said corn planting nationally was about 43
percent completed, eight percentage points behind normal for this
time of year.
   ``Lack of moisture has slowed germination and emergency (of
corn) in Kansas,'' the report said. ``Rain continued to slow
planting in the eastern Corn Belt and the Southeast.''
   Corn planting was 42 percentage points behind in Ohio and 25
points behind in Indiana, the report said, while planting trailed
the usual pace by 34 percentage points in North Carolina.
   Only about 5 percent of the soybean crop had been planted, four
percentage points behind the normal pace, although planting was
under way in all major soybean states except Minnesota and North
Carolina.
   Cotton planting was 42 percent completed, only one percentage
point behind normal.
   Sorghum planting was reported 23 percent completed, one point
ahead of normal. Rice seeding was 71 percent completed, six
percentage points ahead of the normal pace.

   The Agriculture Department has put federally
inspected poultry and hog slaughtering plants in Arkansas under
``intensified surveillance'' for traces of the cancer-causing
pesticide heptachlor.
   Lester M. Crawford, administrator of the department's Food
Safety and Inspection Service, said Tuesday the agency may ``expand
testing into surrounding states'' over the next few weeks. The
stepped-up program for heptachlor in Arkansas began on Monday, he
said.
   The USDA agency has been monitoring Arkansas slaughter plants
since January for traces of heptachlor after finding contaminated
poultry at Townsends of Arkansas in Batesville, he said.
   ``We also began surveillance testing in other poultry and
red-meat slaughtering plants in Arkansas to determine if the
heptachlor problem extended beyond Townsends,'' Crawford said.
``Regrettably, we found additional problems.''
   One hog tested positive for heptachlor at unacceptable levels,
and two others showed traces of the chemical. Meanwhile, he said,
the Food and Drug Administration reported unacceptable heptachlor
levels in non-commerial egg samples.
   Contaminated feed is the suspected cause, although the FDA has
not been able to determine the specific source. At least four feed
mills have been under investigation.
   Crawford said his agency will inform the FDA ``whenever actual
or potential violations are detected through our testing.''
Meanwhile, the FDA will attempt to determine who bought the
contaminated feed. After that, Crawford said his inspectors will
test animals from those producers.
   ``The problems occurring with heptachlor are disturbing,'' he
said. ``Heptachlor has been shown to induce tumors in mice. In
1978, the Environmental Protection Agency banned heptachlor for all
agricultural uses except as a seed treatment, but it is apparent
from the problems we're finding now that residues from treated seed
persist in food animals.''
   Crawford said the problem will not be resolved until the
practice of using chemically treated seed as animal feed is
stopped. ``We are very encouraged by the EPA announcement that they
will ban the future use of heptachlor on treated seed,'' he added.

   When the Agriculture Department talks about an
underground spy camera, the camera really is under the ground _ six
feet or so under.
   Dan R. Upchurch of the department's Agricultural Research
Service says he'd ``rather poke a camera in the ground than dig
down six feet or so and pull out a plant, roots and all.''
   Upchurch, a soil scientist at the agency's research facility in
Lubbock, Texas, showed some of underground videos at an annual
symposium this week at Beltsville, Md.
   Another alternative to pulling out plants, roots and all, is to
use a rhizotron, a room-sized cellar with glass observation windows
_ just as zoo and marine aquarium visitors view underwater life.
   Upchurch's version is a minirhizotron, which uses a portable
color video system that lets scientists watch roots develop over an
entire growing season. A clear plastic tube is inserted in the soil
and a pocket-sized video camera is lowered. The researchers watch
roots on a television monitor.
   The roots are seen about 25 times actual size, depending on the
monitor, he said. Through time-lapse photography, drought-stricken
roots are seen to break up as the soil shrinks.

   Publicity about a Cuban art auction in Miami sent
investigators on a trail that led to the former spokesman for the
U.S. government in Havana, according to court papers accusing him
of smuggling.
   Although no charges have been filed, the Customs Service on
Tuesday said U.S. Information Agency employee Jerry W. Scott
brought the Cuban paintings into the United States in violation of
the Cuban trade embargo.
   Records and the paintings have been seized from a Miami art
dealer, Ramon Cernuda, said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for U.S.
Attorney Dexter Lehtinen.
   ``We have a lot of documents, records and other evidence to go
over,'' Ms. Cossin said Tuesday. ``It's not over yet by any means.''
   Customs agent Peter D. Liston said in court papers that Scott
brought 40 paintings into Miami International Airport in February
1988 and failed to declare them. He later acknowledged turning over
the paintings to Cernuda, the agent said.
   Customs began its investigation following publicity about an
April 1988 auction at the Cuban Museum of Art and Culture in Miami.
The auction involved Cernuda-owned Cuban paintings, Liston said.
   U.S. law has prohibited virtually all commerce with Cuba since
1963. Violators can face up to 10 years in prison and $250,000 in
fines.
   Scott worked for USIA as spokesman for the U.S. Interests
Section. The United States has no formal relations with Cuba but
maintains the Interests Section to handle such things as visas and
routine legal transactions.
   USIA spokesman William Reinckens said no disciplinary action was
planned. He would not discuss the case against Scott, who now works
in Washington.

   PARIS (A) _ Mayor Jacques Chirac on Wednesday unveiled the
city's newest monument _ a golden Flame of Liberty that he said
symbolized enduring French-American friendship.
   The flame, made of hammered brass covered with 5,000 gold
leaves, is a duplicate of the one that shines over New York harbor
on the Statue of Liberty.
   The monument stands at the Place de l'Alma in the city's
fashionable 16th district with the Eiffel Tower across the Seine
River serving as a backdrop.
   ``This is an important event in the old, fraternal ties between
France and the United States,'' Chirac said at the unveiling
ceremony. `` The monument is a symbol of two qualities, liberty and
international friendship.''
   The Paris-based International Herald Tribune newspaper, as part
of the celebration of its centennial in 1987, sponsored a worldwide
fund-raising appeal to bring the flame to Paris.
   The monument was built in the United States by Les Metalliers
Champenois, the same group of French artisans who worked on the
recent rehabilitation of the Liberty statue in 1986. The Paris
flame was cast using the same molds for that project.

   The government, which has announced plans to
release more than 400 political prisoners, is preparing to free
nearly 1,000 others, news reports said.
   News agencies said Tuesday the Interior Ministry's human rights
department has drawn up a list of another 989 prisoners. It did not
say when the inmates would be released.
   The government news agency Notimex quoted an unidentified human
rights official as saying the new cases were being studied to see
how they qualify for amnesty. The list will be released this week
and the number of prisoners could be increased, Notimex said.
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari first announced in February
the release of 403 political prisoners.
   The Excelsior news agency reported that the majority of the 989
prisoners set to be freed are being held on charges related to land
disputes between peasants and landowners.

   Avon Products Inc. today said it received a
$39-a-share cash takeover offer from its smaller rival in the
door-to-door sales business, Amway Corp.
   Amway's bid places a value of about $2.1 billion on Avon, based
on nearly 54 million outstanding common shares. The value would be
higher if it included 18 million shares of preferred Avon stock in
investors' hands.
   Avon was up $2.62{ a share to $38.62{ at midday on the New York
Stock Exchange following the announcement.
   Avon, a cosmetics, toiletries and household products company
with sales last year of $3.06 billion, has said it is not for sale
and has taken legal action to discourage takeover interest by Amway
and Amway partner Irwin Jacobs.
   The partnership of Ada, Mich.-based Amway and Jacobs, a
Minneapolis investor, previously disclosed it held 10.3 percent of
Avon's common stock and might attempt to get control of the company.
   In an effort to block a bid, Avon sued in federal court,
accusing the partnership of not complying with securities
disclosure requirements.
   Amway is a privately held consumer and household products
company.

   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said today that
fighting drugs in public housing rank in importance with repair and
modernization of units, as hundreds of residents gathered outside
the White House to protest the lack of federal money for
construction and rehabilitation.
   Kemp also said that if given flexibility in allocating the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's public housing budget
and additional money specifically earmarked for anti-drug efforts
he could make ``a significant attack'' on the problem.
   ``The anti-drug effort in public housing is as important a part
of modernization and rehabilitation in public housing as anything
else,'' he told the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations.
   Housing officials and tenants from Chicago, New York,
Washington, D.C. and Delaware joined Kemp to discuss federal
anti-drug efforts in public housing at the hearing.
   Meanwhile, members of the National Tenants Organization gathered
for a rally in Lafayette Park across from the White House.
   ``We're asking HUD to make emergency money available for an
immediate rehabilitation program for all boarded-up public
housing,'' Maxine Green, NTO's chairwoman, said in advance of the
rally.
   Green said her group is concerned with recent estimates that
70,000 units of public housing lie idle and in disrepair.
   ``We talked about drugs years ago and no one wanted to address
that because they felt it only touched poor people,'' said the Ft.
Pierce, Fla., resident.
   Drug abuse and trafficking in public housing have been key
issues for Kemp since he witnessed drug sales while touring
developments in several major cities in February.
   In March, Kemp waived HUD administrative appeals procedures to
allow public housing officials in Virginia to speed evictions of
suspected drug dealers. The secretary said he would extend the
exemption to other housing authorities that could demonstrate state
and local laws would provide due process to tenants facing eviction.
   Last month the secretary outlined a series of anti-drug actions
_ issuance of photo tenant identification cards, installation of
security fences around projects and increased police patrols _
available to local public housing authorities.
   But Green said, ``Mr. Kemp was not appointed drug czar,'' and
the responsibility of dealing with the nation's housing problems is
too great for Kemp to take on the added duties of fighting drugs.
She also said NTO has requested that Kemp appoint a committee of
representatives from NTO, HUD, Congress and city officials to work
with federal drug czar William Bennett.
   ``It is within the secretary's responsibility to make sure that
public housing is decent, livable and safe,'' said Mary Brunette,
Kemp's special assistant.
   ``I think that although Kemp's drug initiative in public housing
is important, the real issue is in building more housing and
maintaining the housing stock that we have left after the Reagan
years,'' said Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., who was to deliver the
keynote address at the rally marking the tenant group's tenth
annual ``Save Public Housing Day.''
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he sees no conflict
between the NTO and the secretary because both want to preserve
public housing.
   Rangel, who was also to appear at the rally, said he hadn't seen
Kemp's proposals and while he wants to ensure tenants are afforded
due process in any eviction procedure, he was adamant about
punishment.
   ``When apartments are used for the packaging, processing and
sale of drugs that apartment should not be available to those
people,'' Rangel said. ``They should be in public housing of
another kind, jails.''

<HEAD>Government Backs $4.5 Billion Rail Link Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERN, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Wednesday its
support for a $4.5 billion rail link to handle an anticipated
increase in commercial trans-Alpine traffic in the next 20 years.
   The plans call for a new 31-mile tunnel through the Gotthard
Massif in central Switzerland, which would run below the
107-year-old, 9.3-mile link. The tunnel, estimated to be completed
by the year 2005, would match the length of the channel tunnel
between Britain and France planned for 1993.
   The old Gotthard tunnel handles more than four-fifths of the
rail freight passing through Switzerland but won't be able to cope
with an increase in traffic expected after the unified European
Economic Community market after 1992.
   The project also envisions a new 17.6-mile tunnel through Mount
Loetschberg connecting the Bern region with western Switzerland and
Italy. That link could be finished by 1997.
   Parliament is expected to take up the project next winter. If
100,000 people sign petitions against the plan, it would be put to
a nationwide vote.
   Switzerland has about 680 railway tunnels through its mountains.
It also has about 40 road tunnels, including the world's longest _
10.1 miles _ also piercing the Gotthard Massif.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Kang Young-hoon said
Wednesday he is willing to bow to opposition demands to resign if
he is held responsible for mishandling state affairs such as the
wave of political violence.
   But the leader of President Roh Tae-woo's 22-member Cabinet
reiterated his government's determination to crush leftist radical
groups.
   ``The government will not sit idle when campuses are becoming
firebomb-manufacturing factories. Neither will we allow them to
become the bases of violence,'' Kang told the National Assembly.
   ``Also, I am willing to resign if held responsible for any state
affairs that have been mishandled,'' he said.
   Opposition members used the session to launch an offensive
against Roh's government, demanding Kang and all Cabinet ministers
resign for failing to provide effective leadership.
   Dissenting legislators charged the government is blocking
democratic reform and using a crackdown on violent protests to
suppress all its opponents. They accused the government of
provoking unrest.
   The opposition-controlled assembly can pass a resolution calling
on the Cabinet to resign, but the administration is not obliged by
law to honor such a motion. Opposition legislators did not call for
Roh's resignation.
   Answering their charges, Kang said diss and undermine the
Seoul government. The two nations have been bitter rivals since
1945.
   The government stepped up its crackdown after six riot policemen
were killed in a May 3 clash with radical students in southern
Pusan city.
   Roh warned he would invoke emergency powers to end violent
protests.
   Justice Minister Huh Hyung-koo, testifying in parliament
Wednesday, said 234 radical students, workers and dissidents have
been arrested since last month. Police are hunting for 76 more
radicals, he said.
   The ruling Democratic Justice Party is trying to ban firebombs,
a major radical weapon in anti-government protests, and increase
prison sentences for using them from the existing three years to
seven years.
   Opposition leaders have agreed in principle to adopt the
anti-firebomb bill, but they contend the government also must limit
police use of tear gas, which they say is excessive and tends to
aggravate violence.
   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups have
little support because of their violent tactics and extreme
political views. The radicals want a leftist state ruled by workers
and farmers.

   The assassination of Army Col. James N. Rowe
in the Philippines last month will not keep the United States from
helping the Philippine government or from using its military bases
in that country, said a resolution endorsed Wednesday by a House
committee.
   The communist New Peoples Army has declared responsibility for
the April 21 fatal shooting of Rowe, chief U.S. ground forces
military adviser in the Philippines, while he was en route to his
office in suburban Manila.
   ``The Congress categorically rejects any attempts by the New
Peoples Army, whether through assasinations or through other
methods of violence or intimidation, to force the United States to
withdraw from mililtary facilities in the Philippines or to end its
support for the democratically elected government of the
Philippines,'' declared the resolution approved by voice vote of
the subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs. It was sent to the
full Foreign Affairs Committee.
   The subcommittee chairman, Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y.,
sponsored the resolution, which also says that ``the United States
should continue to provide economic and military assistance to the
Philippines in order to facilitate efforts by the government of the
Philippines to consolidate democracy, address ... underlying
economic problems and combat the New Peoples Army insurgency.''
   The resolution also contained authority to give the Philippine
government two surplus Navy vessels, a tug and a floating drydock.

<HEAD>Study: Many With Chest Pain Have Healthy Heart but Anxiety Troubles</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people with perfectly healthy
hearts are living as virtual ``cardiac cripples'' because of chest
pains caused by untreated anxiety or panic disorders, a researcher
says.
   They avoid exertion and fear they might have heart disease even
after medical tests show their hearts are normal, said psychiatrist
Francis Kane Jr.
   He and colleagues surveyed 371 people who had complained of
chest pain or other apparent heart trouble, but who showed no sign
of disease when tested with a procedure called an angiogram.
   An angiogram detects narrowing of the arteries that supply blood
to the heart muscle. That narrowing can set the stage for heart
attack.
   Despite the angiogram findings, 56 percent of the people were
unsure about whether they had heart disease. Forty-five percent
feared that exertion would be dangerous, and 32 percent said they
were limited in physical activities.
   Sixty-nine percent of the people qualified for diagnosis of
panic attacks or another anxiety disorder, based on their answers
to the survey, said Kane, psychiatry professor at the Baylor
College of Medicine in Houston.
   More than 1 million Americans have panic attacks, which inflict
sudden bouts of intense terror for no apparent reason, according to
the American Psychiatric Association.
   About half had been told their symptoms were due to stress, but
only 4 percent were told to seek mental health treatment and only
17 percent were given tranquilizers, Kane said.
   He spoke in an interview before presenting the study Tuesday at
the annual meeting of the American Psychiatric Association.
   In a telephone interview, cardiologist Adolph Hutter of
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston said anxiety and stress
are not the only possible explanations for chest pain in people
with normal angiogram results.
   More common causes in his professional experience, he said, are
a spasm in the esophagus, the muscular tube leading from the
pharynx to the stomach, or a tenderness of cartilage in the chest
wall.
   Brian Doyle, clinical professor of psychiatry and of family
medicine at Georgetown Medical School, said Kane's paper
illustrates ``the way it is.''
   Cases of chest pains and breathing difficulties in response to
anxiety crop up frequently in his work with family doctors, he said.
   About 540,000 angiograms were performed in 1984, and the annual
total has probably risen since, Kane said. About 10 percent to 45
percent of such tests find no sign of heart disease, he said.
   In Kane's study, 90 percent of the patients had suffered chest
pain before the angiogram and a third had been hospitalized for it.
About a third had complained of breathing difficulties, and smaller
fractions had reported feelings of suffocation, palpitations,
dizziness or sweating.
   At the time they were surveyed, eight months to 18 months after
the angiograms, 76 percent reported they still had chest pain, and
37 percent said they were still seeing a doctor because of it.
   Symptoms of chest pain, palpitation, breathlessness and fear of
fainting tended strongly to be reported by people who also appeared
to suffer from panic attacks, the survey showed.
   The survey also found that generalized anxiety disorder was
linked to persistent chest pain and belief that one had suffered a
heart attack. Fifty-five percent of the sample believed they had
suffered a heart attack, although only 2 percent had been told that
in the past.
   Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by unrealistic or
excessive anxiety and worry about two or more circumstances of
one's life for six months or more.
   While the study's use of questionnaires rather than interviews
tends to make the diagnoses less secure, the results are consistent
with previous interview-based studies, said psychiatrist Wayne
Katon of the University of Washington in Seattle.
   Doyle, who is leading a psychiatric association effort to help
physicians recognize panic disorder, said many doctors overlook
anxiety when analyzing physical symptoms.
   And patients just don't like the idea, he said.
   ``For most people, being told they have symptoms based on
psychological difficulties is a real insult,'' he said. ``It's
considered a sign of moral weakness. It's a personal failing, it's
not an acceptable diagnosis.''

   A team of forensic scientists plans to dig
into a Colorado grave and perhaps settle the century-old questions
surrounding Alfred _ or is it Alferd? _ Packer, to wit: Who killed
whom and who ate whom?
   Packer, a gold prospector and Union Army veteran, has stood
accused in history of killing five fellow prospectors and eating
the flesh of some of them.
   He confessed to killing only one, but said he did it in
self-defense and admitted to cannibalism, but only in the interest
of self-preservation.
   Much is not known about him for certain, including his first
name. It is ``Alfred'' in some court documents _ he signed a
confession that way and some letters to the parole board, and his
death certificate reads ``Alfred'' _ but it was ``Alferd'' in a
tattoo he wore and on some other documents he'd signed. At his
trial, he referred to himself pretty consistently as ``Packer.''
   To demonstrate how much can be learned when the sciences of
anthropology team up with pathology and archeology in solving
crimes, James Starrs, professor of law and forensic science at
George Washington University's National Law Center, plans to lead
an expedition in July to the prospectors' joint grave near Lake
City, Colo.
   The experts think they can determine the extent of which
cannibalism was committed by looking for bone scrapes that would
likely occur.
   If they find evidence of gunshot holes in the bones of more than
one victim, they will have disproved the story that Packer told in
court.
   He said that an awesome snowstorm in April 1874 in the Colorado
Rockies stranded the prospectors for a month and threatened them
with starvation. So he was sent out with a rifle to kill an animal.
   Five days later, he subsequently told the authorities, he
returned empty handed to find four of the prospectors dead, killed
by hatchet, and the fifth, Shannon Wilson Bell, about to attack him
with a hatchet. He said he shot Bell, then struck him with the same
instrument.
   Packer also claimed that he found parts of his colleagues
boiling in a stewpot. He confessed to helping himself, but said he
did it to stay alive.
   Packer left and mingled in society for some weeks, but questions
about the case finally led to his arrest.
   He escaped but nine years later was recaptured in Wyoming. He
was tried for murder and sentenced to hang. The sheriff sent out
fancy invitations to the hanging, but the Colorado Supreme Court
set the verdict aside on the grounds that the legislature had
repealed the death penalty during the time Packer was a fugitive.
   Packer was retried for manslaughter, sentenced to 40 years, and
paroled after 17. He died in 1907, still insisting he had killed
only Bell and only in self-defense.
   Packer found a defender in Ervan F. Kushner, 74, a retired judge
and prosecutor from Paterson, N.J., and author of ``Alfred G.
Packer: Criminal! Victim?''
   Kushner accepts Packer's version, says his two trials were
riddled with errors and questions the worth of Starrs' ``macabre''
undertaking.
   ``Mr. Starrs is a well-known forensics expert,'' Kushner said,
``but what possible proof can there be found in the bones as to
motive? If he enjoys digging in that beautiful scenery, that's a
great place to dig, but how will it establish who struck the first
blow?''
   Starrs agreed the bones won't tell much about motive, but can
answer other questions. Packer, he said, ``was a concerted and
deliberate and long-term liar throughout the trial.''
   Starrs said that bullet holes in more than one set of bones will
tend to establish that Packer, not Bell, killed the four other
prospectors.
   Starrs also said there is no truth to the legend that presiding
judge Melville B. Gerry, in sentencing Packer to hang, commented on
the demographic-political consequences of the slayings, saying that
there had been only seven Democrats in all of Hinsdale County ``and
ye ate five of 'em!''
   In 1981, Kushner petitioned Richard D. Lamm, then the governor
of Colorado, to pardon Packer posthumously.
   Lamm, although a Democrat, wouldn't, but said he found himself
agreeing with another Packer defender, poet Olive Nagel Porter:
   ``Let's not condemn poor Packer
   Nor crowd his soul with abuse
   Though he hardly would merit approval,
   `Hunger' is valid excuse.''

<HEAD>Despite Promises, Pennsylvania Tax Vote Creates Confusion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to restructure Pennsylvania's
local taxes is being contested with the zeal of carnival hucksters,
and voters appear to be confused over whether it would mean lower
taxes or another dig into their pockets.
   The complex proposal appears on a statewide referendum May 16,
boiled down to a critical 50 words dealing with the balance between
business and residential taxes. If approved, it would mark the
first major change in the state's local tax system since the
mid-1960s.
   At the heart of the plan is a tradeoff: Homeowners are being
promised property tax reductions in exchange for allowing local
governments to raise income taxes.
   It's a trend that has been taking place around the country.
Similar proposals to place a larger tax burden on income are being
weighed in Michigan, Nebraska, Washington and Montana.
   Predictions of what Pennsylvania's plan will mean for average
taxpayers have varied so greatly that its essential component _
seeking greater fairness by taxing income instead of property _
seems lost. The sole focus has become whether overall local taxes
will go up, or down.
   The plan's architects hold that those hurt most by increasing
property taxes are residents on fixed and lower incomes, including
many elderly. By shifting more of the tax burden to income, the
state would be creating a fairer tax system that would benefit
those groups, they say.
   According to state figures, about 58 percent of the local tax
revenue across the state is now raised through property taxes and
about 11.5 percent from income. Under the proposed changes,
property taxes would make up about 30 percent of the local tax base
and income about 40 percent.
   The great irony _ and a fact acknowledged by both sides in the
debate _ is that no one can truly say what will happen: There are
just too many local variables.
   In addition to the property-income tax shift, the bill would
also allow counties to use a sales tax; the despised Philadelphia
wage tax, imposed on both city residents and suburbanites who work
in the city, would be lowered; and other local wage taxes would be
eliminated.
   ``It's like picking the Lotto; it's just not something that can
be done with any precision,'' said Robert Greenwood of the
Pennsylvania Economy League, an independent research group.
   The confusion is illustrated in estimates prepared by various
groups at the state Capitol. The administration of Gov. Robert P.
Casey, a Democrat who championed the plan, has predicted that a
family in Lehigh County in eastern Pennsylvania making about
$30,000 annually would pay about 12 percent less in local taxes
under the reforms. Senate Democrats say a family in that county
making $25,000 would pay 17 percent more.
   Using such figures, supporters are trying to sell the plan as a
tax cut for most homeowners while opponents are pitching it as a
virtual across-the-board tax hike.
   The shrill tenor of the tax debate was unexpected in
Pennsylvania, where there is no tradition of controversial ballot
questions. In the past 30 years, only nine of the 68 statewide
referendums have been voted down, and those elections were
low-profile.
   Republican opponents like to describe the referendum as a
measuring stick for the governor's popularity. Casey urged the
Legislature to enact the plan last fall, and Republicans are
apparently looking for potential political ammunition for Casey's
expected re-election bid next year.
   ``(Casey) has attached his star to this issue. ...The governor
has gone way, way out on a limb,'' said Senate President Robert
Jubelirer, a Republican and opponent of the tax plan.
   The whole thing has proven difficult to sell to voters, a
political consultant's nightmare.
   ``It's certainly different and unique compared to promoting a
candidate. It's a concept, and a concept that's very difficult to
grasp,'' said David Sanko, a coordinator for Citizens Against
Higher Taxes, a group opposed to the plan.
   ``I'm disgusted with the distortion and the partisan political
debate,'' said John Stauffer, a former Republican leader in the
state Senate who is co-chairman of the Vote Yes Committee, which
supports the plan.
   ``If anything it will get worse in the final few days. It will
be a typical election,'' he said.

   A band of 50 bicycle-riding writers, poets and
novelists joined Wednesday's demonstration for a free press and
democracy, marking the first time intellectuals have taken part in
China's student protests.
   ``People stand up, don't be slaves,'' read the T-shirt worn by
Xu Gang, a poet and a writer.
   ``We made them ourselves,'' he said, pointing proudly to his
chest. ``Very fine calligraphy, wouldn't you say?''
   Xu and his colleagues said they came out to support students and
journalists in their call for a free press.
   ``They should not be allowed to stand alone,'' said Su Xiaokang,
a leading essayist.
   On Wednesday, thousands of students bicycled to the offices of
major media to press their call for freedom of expression. The
protest came a day after journalists presented the government with
a petition signed by more than 1,000 reporters requesting a
dialogue with the government.
   Reporters said they wanted to discuss the recent firing of the
editor of a liberal Shanghai paper and the issue of censorship.
   The intellectuals joined the protest midway and bicycled with
the students to the gates of the People's Daily, the newspaper of
China's Communist Party.
   Recognized by many in front of the newspaper's office, they were
almost crushed as the crowd pressed in.
   ``I can't breathe,'' said novelist Xu Xin. After sevaral minutes
of pushing and shoving, the band of intellectuals broke through.
   Xu Gang said he felt odd coming back to the People's Daily as a
protester. The poet once worked as a journalist at the paper.
During the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, he was accused of being a
``rightist'' and ousted from his job.
   ``They haven't really changed much,'' he said, as the crowd
around him chanted, ``The People's Daily deceives the people.''
   ``They are just serving different masters,'' he said.
   Xu Xin said he also felt odd, but for a different reason.
   The novelist, well-known among the young for his black humor and
bawdy prose, said he usually doesn't participate in politics.
   ``But this is something special,'' he said. ``This is a real
movement.''
   China's intellectuals for the most part have stayed on the
sidelines during the recent student demonstrations for a freer
China. Protests began following the death April 15 of Hu Yaobang,
the ousted Communist Party chief.
   Many of them support the movement but do so quietly. Some are
fearful that participation could affect their livelihood. Others
say that as adults they feel ``silly'' demonstrating.
   Earlier in the year, intellectuals were at the forefront of a
movement calling for the release of China's political prisoners.
   Essayists, poets, scientists and novelists wrote open letters to
the government, calling for the release of Wei Jingsheng, who was
sentenced in 1979 to 15 years in prison for ``counterrevolutionary
crimes.''
   The government has said no amnesty will be granted and has
denied that China has political prisoners.
   ``Freedom, the voice of a poet,'' read a T-shirt worn by the
young poet, Qu Wei.
   ``Today we are doing what little we can,'' he said as he got on
his bicycle to ride home. ``Perhaps tomorrow we will be able to do
more.''

   The Air Force appears to be maintaining an
unnecessarily large cash balance in operating a key spare parts and
supply system, a congressional audit concluded Wednesday.
   When the Air Force does make refunds, it gyps other military
services out of their money to help cover its own budget cuts, the
congressional General Accounting Office added.
   The audit found the Air Force's Stock Fund had issued $131
million in refunds in fiscal 1988, with all of the refund money
going into the service's own operation and maintenance account even
though the Navy, the Air National Guard, the Air Force Reserve,
foreign governments and various other customers had purchased items
from the Stock Fund that year.
   The GAO said that if the refunds had been distributed
proportionately, based on purchases, foreign customers would have
received refunds totaling $18 million; the Navy, $12 million; the
Guard and Reserve, $6 million; and the other customers, a combined
$5 million.
   ``As a result of the Stock Fund's disproportionate refund
practices, certain customers financed the refund made to the Air
Force's operation and maintenance appropriation,'' the audit
concluded.
   The 12-page audit, requested by the House Appropriations defense
subcommittee late last year, was released Wednesday. The Air Force
declined immediate comment, saying it had not received a copy.
   For the most part, the audit focuses on the intricacies of a
highly technical accounting system that must deal with wide
fluctuations in daily cash balances. But it also shows how annual
budget and accounting changes made by Congress can cause problems
for a government bureacracy, as well as spotlighting the internal
competition among the armed forces when money gets tight.
   The Air Force Stock Fund is simply a huge, centralized office
supply and spare parts system doing about $27 million a day in
``business.''
   It buys and distributes supplies and relatively inexpensive
equipment as needed by various military units. Most of the
``customers'' are Air Force units, although selected units from
other services can use the Air Force system for the sake of
convenience.
   To ensure that enough money is on hand every day to pay
suppliers, the fund marks up the cost of its items by a small
amount _ generating what in the commercial sector would be a profit.
   The House Appropriations panel asked the GAO to analyze the
Stock Fund because the Air Force says it needs to keep an operating
balance equal to 11 days' of business, or about $297 million, and
sets its mark-up accordingly.
   The audit challenged the Air Force's approach, saying the 11-day
standard fails to reflect the fact that Congress now provides
special appropriations to the Stock Fund ``to purchase war reserve
materiel and inventory items to support weapon systems
modernization and modification.''
   Over the last seven years, those appropriations averaged $421
million a year, the GAO said.
   If the Air Force would shift to a 3-day standard and formally
acknowledge the appropriated money, the Pentagon's budget could be
cut automatically by $216 million in budget authority, the GAO said.
   As for the refunds, the GAO said Congress had pushed the Stock
Fund to refund a total of $711 million over the last three years
during annual budget reviews. The refunds were then used to offset
budget cuts.
   The only problem with that, the auditors said, was that ``the
refunds were made only to selected customers and were not
distributed proportionately ... based on sales.''

<HEAD>American Mobility Holding Steady on a Southerly Course</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most Americans who move don't venture far from
their old homes but those who switch states seem to prefer to head
south, the Census Bureau said Wednesday.
   Southern states scored a net gain of 279,000 movers between
March 1986 and March 1987, the bureau said in a study covering the
most recent mobility figures available.
   The analysis of people who moved during that time found that
18.1 percent of all Americans relocated, about the same as in the
year before, amounting to about 42.5 million people changing homes.
   Those movers included 27.2 million who relocated within the same
county, 8.8 million who moved to another county in the same state
and 6.6 million who changed states.
   In addition, 1.1 million people moved in from abroad.
   The South's strong showing resumes the trend of the early 1980s
when the that region was the largest gainer as millions of
Americans flocked to the Sun Belt.
   In 1984-85 and 1985-86, the attractiveness of the South seemed
to slip a bit, with the Western states showing the largest gain
from movers.
   But the new study shows the West back in second place, adding
166,000 movers to their population in the 1986-87 period.
   Most of the 1986-87 movers who changed regions _ 334,000 _ came
from the Northeast, with the remaining 111,000 leaving the Midwest,
according to the study.
   Overall mobility has been relatively steady in this decade,
slightly below the 20 percent annual rates recorded in the 1960s
and 1970s.
   There was a jump back to the 20 percent moving rate in 1984-85,
which some analysts attributed to pent-up demand among people who
had postponed moves during the recession early in the decade. Since
then, the rate has evened out again.
   The 1986-87 analysis found that movement into metropolitan areas
is continuing, with a net gain of 932,000 people. Within these
areas it was the suburbs that were growing, however. Central cities
lost 1 million people over the year while suburbs grew by 1.9
million.
   Hispanic Americans moved more often than Americans in general,
relocating at a 22.6 percent rate. Blacks recorded a 19.6 percent
mobility rate and non-Hispanic whites had a 17.4 percent rate.
   Regionally, blacks, like other Americans, moved South. The South
had a net gain of 148,000 blacks during the year, while all three
other regions showed a net loss of blacks.
   Regional mobility figures for Hispanics were not reported, nor
were figures for individual states.
   Other findings of the study included:
   _Young adults were the most mobile Americans, with 34.7 percent
of those aged 20 to 24 moving during the year, and a 31.8 percent
rate for people aged 25 to 29.
   _Men were somewhat more likely to have moved than women, 18.4
percent vs. 17.8 percent.
   _Bein a member of a family tended to add to stability, the study
found. People living in a family had a 16.4 percent rate of moving,
compared with 22.1 percent for people living alone or with
unrelated people.
   _People who had completed four years of college had the highest
mobility rate, 21.8 percent. People who attended college but didn't
graduate were next at 19.6 percent. People who had gone on to grad
school moved at about the same rate as those who only finished high
school, 17 percent.
   The lowest rate was 11.8 percent for people who had not finished
high school. Most of them are elderly, the study said.

<TEXT>
   Anti-Semitism is increasing in Hungary,
a rabbi said Wednesday, and he called for ties with Israel during
the first parliamentary commemoration of Holocaust victims.
   Rabbi Alfred Schoener addressed a session of Parliament that
paid tribute to the 600,000 Hungarian Jews who died in the
Holocaust and to tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians who
perished in World War II.
   The commemoration came on the 45th anniversary of the start of
mass deportations of Hungarian Jews to death camps.
   ``I don't know whether there is more anti-Semitism in Hungary
today than before, but I must say it has become more open,''
Schoener said.
   Swastikas were painted on a synagogue wall, the windows of
Jewish seminaries were broken, and Jews were being insulted in the
streets, he said.
   ``We must not allow anti-Semitism to grow in our society which,
undergoing democratization, allows many things to happen,''
Schoener said.
   He also complained Hungarian school textbooks contain only
cursory mention of the Holocaust and ``for some reason the very
word `Jew' has been avoided in the media.''
   Schoener also criticized the absence of a memorial to the 6
million Jews killed by the Nazis in World War II.
   One way of remembering the deportations would be ``to establish
full diplomatic rlations with Israel, where many Holocaust
survivors and relatives of beloved ones still live,'' the rabbi
said.
   Hungary, along with the rest of the Warsaw Pact, broke off
diplomatic relations with Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
   Parliamentary speaker Matyas Szueroes reviewed wartime
atrocities and said the persecution of Jews and others considered
undesirable by the fascists were ``swept under the carpet'' by
Hungarian leaders after the war.
   ``Let us now discuss what we have not been able to discuss for
over 40 years,'' said the speaker.
   He proposed that Parliament draft legislation to commemorate all
wartime victims.
   ``Let us tell the world that we Hungarians and other
nationalities living in Hungary are resolved never to let this
happen again,'' Szueroes said.
   Four other parliamentarians took the floor to criticize official
unwillingness to come to terms with wartime tragedies.
   Deputy Laszlo Czoma mentioned a history book published in
Hungary in 1975 that discussed the loss of human lives in one
sentence. Another sentence was devoted to the wartime losses of
livestock, he added.

   The Hostess cupcake got a 70th birthday party
Wednesday, and the guest of honor was a retiree whose loopy idea
brought his company sweet success.
   D.R. ``Doc'' Rice, 83, returned to Detroit to celebrate his role
four decades ago in jazzing up the treat with a sugary ``creme''
filling and a squiggly white line of icing.
   The cupcake Hostess introduced on May 10, 1919, was made of
devil's food cake and hand-covered with vanilla or chocolate icing.
Sales were stale by World War II, when rationing restricted the
amount and quality of sugar and chocolate.
   Enter Rice, a cupcake fancier who developed a fancier cupcake at
Continental Baking Co.'s Detroit plant.
   St. Louis-based Continental Baking, which owns Hostess, sold 400
million cupcakes last year.
   Detroit residents bought more than people in any other city.
   ``We thought about that a lot and there are several reasons,''
Rice said in a telephone interview from Chicago on Tuesday. ``It's
where we first made them and test-marketed them. The Hostess cake
always has had a good reputation in Detroit. I guess people have
good taste there.''

   A mountain gorilla named Amohoro in
Africa has a new family: 100 junior high school students who raised
$1,200 to ``adopt'' her.
   The seventh-graders at Cache La Poudre Junior High School on
Tuesday became the first group of students to adopt a mountain
gorilla through the Digit Fund, a program established by the late
primatologist Dian Fossey.
   The students baby-sat, worked odd jobs and solicited donations
for six weeks to raise the money.
   ``You are the first class in the world to ever adopt a gorilla,
and you deserve a lot of credit,'' Ruth Keesling, president of the
Digit Fund, told the beaming students gathered on bleachers in the
school's gymnasium.
   The money, $200 more than the $1,000 the fund requires for an
adoption, will go to fight poaching and to pay for research into
the gorillas' behavior and social patterns, Keesling said.
   Fossey established the fund, based in the Denver suburb of
Englewood, in 1978 to garner international support for the
endangered gorillas. While lowland gorillas thrive in Africa, there
are only about 280 mountain gorillas left in the world. Fossey's
work inspired the movie ``Gorillas In The Mist.''
   The students received a photo of their adopted gorilla, whose
name means Peace.

   Her hearing is faulty and his dancing is
wobbly, but that didn't stop them from getting married so they
could grow old together.
   Boris Feldman, 80, and his bride, Jean, 81, were living separate
lives at Victory Village, one of two retirement communities
operated by the Jewish Homes for the Aging of Greater Los Angeles.
   They met in the dining room in March.
   ``We just started talking to each other. I did like her. I
figured she was just about the size I wanted _ not too tall and not
too fat,'' said Feldman.
   ``He was just a nice person to talk to,'' his wife said.
``That's all I was looking for.''
   On their first and second dates, they attended Victory Village
dances, just ``old-fashioned waltzes,'' Feldman explained, because
``my legs are not as fit as they used to be.''
   Their courtship lasted only two weeks and they were married
March 26.
   Mrs. Feldman said she was ``surprised when he proposed and I
accepted. He caught me at the right moment.'' He noted it ``was a
little hard to propose but she made it easy for me.''
   They decided getting married ``was a good idea and did it. I
like him and I'm comfortable with him. What more do you want in a
man?'' Mrs. Feldman said.
   They have yet to have their first argument. ``We don't have any
money to fight for,'' Feldman quipped.
   ``We still hold hands,'' he added.
   Life is not very demanding, Feldman said. ``We have a lot of
respect for each other,'' his wife added.
   Their days are filled with retirement community activities:
Three meals a day, lectures, bingo games where the top prize
sometimes reaches $1, dances and walks around the grounds.
   ``We just make small talk. We can't make any big plans,'' Mrs.
Feldman said. But they do try to keep each other fit and healthy.
   Mrs. Feldman, just 5 feet tall, says she has to watch what she
eats because she doesn't want to get ``too fat'' for her new
husband.
   Feldman likes to garden and proudly points out there will be
fresh radishes and green onions soon. Mrs. Feldman can't knit much
anymore, so she watches her husband tend to his hobby on their
patio.
   Before they were married, he had a single room at the center,
she shared one with another woman. Combining belongings and moving
into their small married quarters caused few problems. They found
room for everything, although ``he's got more clothes than I
have,'' Mrs. Feldman said.
   They have a television set in their room. Feldman's favorite
shows include ``Phil Donohue'' and ``60 Minutes.'' Mrs. Feldman
turns on the set ``only if I'm bored with myself.''
   Feldman was married once before, a relationship that lasted 50
years until his wife died two years ago. About his second marriage,
his son and daughter ``said it was OK and wished me a lot of
luck,'' he said.
   This is Mrs. Feldman's third marriage. After a 12-year marriage
and divorce, she met ``the love of my life'' and spent 36 happy
years with him until he died 5{ years ago.
   Her stepchildren and grandchildren were delighted when she
remarried. ``My 8-year-old granddaughter is wild about him,'' she
said.
   They had a large wedding at the Victory Village synagogue, with
few jitters because ``we are too old to get nervous anymore,''
Feldman said.
   ``I think I love him,'' Mrs. Feldman said. ``He's a kind and
gentle man.''
   Has love changed, they were asked.
   ``No. Love is the same. It's just like in our young days,'' Mrs.
Feldman said.

<TEXT>
   Tests have confirmed that a tree
transplanted from the White House lawn to the North Dakota Capitol
grounds by President Bush carried the destructive, leaf-eating
gypsy moth.
   ``It's the first time we've ever had gypsy moths in North
Dakota,'' said Keith Winks of the federal Animal and Plant Health
Inspection Service.
   The gypsy moth is a troublesome insect in the eastern United
States and some western states. Its larvae defoliate trees, which
will die if infested too many years in a row, Winks said Tuesday.
   Several tiny moth larvae were found on the president's tree when
it was delivered to Bismarck on April 23, the day before Bush
dedicated the American elm in honor of North Dakota's centennial.
   The tree is a descendant of one planted by President John Quincy
Adams.
   City Forester Paul Blumhardt picked the larvae off the tree and
sprayed the tree with an insecticide. The burlap in which the tree
was wrapped was discarded and the truck that hauled the tree was
sprayed.
   Entomologists at the National Museum in Washington confirmed
that the larvae were gypsy moths, Winks said.
   As part of North Dakota's centennial celebration, the state
plans to plant 100 million trees over the next 10 years.

   Former Gov. George Wallace's brother
says two businessmen owe him stock in a dog track for not asking
his brother to veto the venture, but a judge said such a deal would
be illegal and threw out the claim.
   Circuit Judge William Gordon, in dismissing the $1 million
lawsuit, ruled Tuesday that the agreement, if it existed, could not
be enforced because it was against the law.
   In court papers, Gerald Wallace said he promised Milton McGregor
not to tell his brother, who was then governor, to veto a bill
allowing dog racing. In return, Wallace claimed, McGregor agreed to
pay him a 5 percent stake.
   ``Mr. McGregor knew I could tell my brother to kill the bill,
and it would have been killed,'' Wallace said.
   The law allowing dog racing was approved in 1983, and McGregor's
VictoryLand track opened the next year. George Wallace left office
in 1987.
   Gerald Wallace said lawyer Thomas Marr, in whose name the stock
was held, refused to give him the stock.
   Marr and McGregor maintained no deal was made.
   ``Perhaps Mr. Wallace is hallucinating,'' McGregor said after
the case was dismissed.

<HEAD>U.S. Opposes PLO Application to Join UNESCO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States opposes a Palestine
Liberation Organization application for membership in UNESCO, the
State Department said Wednesday.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said membership
in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization is limited to states, a requirement the PLO lacks.
   Boucher noted that the United States withdrew from UNESCO in
1984. He said that the admission of the PLO as ``Palestine'' would
seriously damage any prospects for resumed U.S. membership.
   ``We have urged UNESCO to make every effort to prevent actions
that would have adverse consequences for the organization, the U.N.
system and the Middle East process,'' he said.
   The PLO applied for UNESCO membership at the organization's
headquarters in Paris on Tuesday.
   The application was made as U.S. representatives were attempting
to defeat a PLO bid for membership in the World Health
Organization, which is also a U.N. agency. The Bush administration
has threatened to cut off funding of any U.N. body which admits the
PLO as a member state.
   In Geneva, the annual assembly of WHO put off for 48 hours
Wednesday a decision on the PLO's membership application.
   At present, the PLO is a non-voting observer in the United
Nations.
   The United States funds a quarter of the WHO budget, donating
$71 million this year, but has not contributed to UNESCO since
dropping its membership five years ago.
   The United States withdrew from UNESCO, alleging excessive
politicization, long-term lack of budgetary restraint and poor
management. At the end of this year, the Bush administration will
review its decision to withdraw.

<TEXT>
   Long-time civil rights activist Charles
Evers, the mayor of Fayette, says he plans to abandon his
long-standing Democratic affiliation to join the Republican Party.
   An outspoken political maverick who has supported Republican
candidates in the past, Evers said it's a mistake for blacks to
primarily support the Democratic Party.
   ``If we don't like what the Republicans do, we need to get in
there and change it,'' he said, adding that he was concerned about
a political realignment along racial lines.
   ``If they don't change rapidly, by the turn of the century,
it'll be a 95 percent white Republican Party and a 99 percent black
Democratic Party. That's not what we need,'' he said.
   State Republican Party Chairwoman Evelyn McPhail said the party
welcomes Evers.
   ``I think what he's doing is what so many elected Democrats and
independent officials are doing. They're saying, `I've been
supporting Republican candidates, and now I'm going to call myself
a Republican,''' she said.
   State Democratic Party Chairman Ed Cole said Evers was only
making official what he has practiced for years. Cole said Evers,
who recently lost a bid for re-election as mayor, still has clout
among black voters.
   ``But clout works only when you're trying to take people where
they want to go. There ain't any man alive who can take a
significant number of black voters to the Republican Party,'' Cole
said.

   New cars dented by hail the size of oranges
are going at bargain prices as dealers try to move the dented,
dinged goods off the lot to make way for replacements.
   Dealers participating in ``Hail Sales'' had sold about 600 cars
by Wednesday, estimated Ray Flowers, general manager of Cooper
Buick GMC Inc.
   A brief but brutal hail storm slammed into Monroe on May 4.
Flowers said he had never seen anything like it.
   ``There's some old people around here who don't remember one
like this,'' he said. ``That's a once-in-a-lifetime hail storm I'm
sure.''
   Damage at the Cooper dealership was mostly minor but Dick
Gifford said his nearby Honda dealership took a severe pounding.
   ``Out of 137 cars in stock we had 67 windows out,'' Gifford said.
   Gifford said he's adding $100 to the wholesale cost of his cars,
then discounting the cost of storm damages. He's replacing windows
at his own cost, he said, but otherwise selling the cars as is _
dents, dings and all.
   ``We're just gettin' `em gone,'' he said. ``We got new cars
coming.''
   An estimated 2,000 cars valued at about $24 million were damaged
by the storms in the Monroe-West Monroe area of northeast
Louisiana, said Larry Cooper, owner of Cooper Buick GMC and
president of Monroe-West Monroe Auto Dealers.
   ``Hail Sales'' brought a flood of loan applicants to banks
Monday.
   ``It was one of our busiest days we've had in several months,''
said Stan Hargett, Central Bank's vice president and manager of the
consumer loan department.
   Banks are financing damaged new vehicles at their actual value
after an insurance company has assessed the damage, lenders said.

<HEAD>Lawyer for Nicaragua Says Don't Assume Elections Will Be Unfair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Nicaragua's government sparred
Wednesday with the co-chairmen of a commission studying plans for
the 1990 Nicaraguan election and charged that some members of the
commission are biased.
   ``Our European and Latin allies are as committed to the spread
of democracy as we are,'' Washington attorney Paul S. Reichler told
the privately financed Commission on Free and Fair Elections in
Nicaragua.
   ``And, as judges, they have two distinct advantages over the
Bush administration, the majority of witnesses before this
commission, and even some of the members: They are unbiased, and
they are unburdened by a need to justify their support for what
even the secretary of state has called `a failed policy.'''
   Reichler told the commission he had represented Nicaragua in
legal cases for nearly 10 years. But he said he was testifying on
his own Wednesday and the Sandinista government ``may or may not
agree with what I have to say.''
   A representative of the Nicaraguan Embassy was invited to
testify, but the embassy declined.
   The commission, established by the conservative World Freedom
Foundation, is made up of three Democrats and three Republicans.
Several witnesses at its opening session Tuesday were skeptical of
the prospects for a fair election in Nicaragua.
   Former Sen. Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., co-chairman of the
commission, told Reichler the fact that Nicaraguan President Daniel
Ortega would appoint all five members of the proposed Supreme
Electoral Council for the election ``makes the process suspect from
the word `go.'''
   Two of the members are to be drawn from Sandinista ranks, two
from opposition parties and the fifth is to be neutral.
   ``I think you would be helpful to your client if you told him
that ... if Ortega insists on appointing the fifth member, it will
be rejected by everybody in this country who understands what
democracy is all about,'' Nelson said. ``We wouldn't accept that in
any precinct in this country.''
   Reichler replied that Ortega has asked the opposition parties
for nominations, and said judgment should be suspended until the
members of the council are named. But Nelson said he believed ``the
integrity of the process is at stake.''
   When Reichler said Nicaragua's much-criticized press law is
``less restrictive than the laws of Venezuela or Costa Rica,'' the
other co-chairman, Curtin Winsor, interjected, ``That's rubbish.''
Winsor, who served as ambassador to Costa Rica during the Reagan
administration, said he was familiar with the laws of both
countries.
   Under an agreement made by Ortega with the governments of Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, Nicaragua's election is
to be held next February. Reichler said he believes the Sandinistas
will win, and that they will hand over power to the winner if they
do not.
   The United States government has been supporting the Contra
rebels in their fight to oust the Marxist-led Nicaraguan
government, though military aid was cut off last year.
   ``The upcoming election in Nicaragua will certainly test the
Sandinistas' commitment to democracy,'' said Reichler, a Washington
attorney. ``It will also test our own. ... The Bush administration,
and most longtime Contra supporters, have already begun to
discredit the process.''
   Peter Rodman, counsellor to the National Security Council at the
White House, told the panel that ``the possibility of a pluralist
future'' in Nicaragua ``is not excluded, and the election obviously
is a test of it.''
   Asked by Nelson what U.S. policy would be if a fair election
resulted in an Ortega victory, Rodman replied, ``I think there is a
presumption that if there is a fair election and we accept it as a
fair election, that makes a big difference in our attitude toward
Nicaragua and certainly our policy.''

Minneapolis school chief, decked out in academic robes, was
attended by the mayor, the governor and every other top city and
state official.
   He was the hero riding in from the West, taking over as New York
City's first black schools chancellor at a time when many wondered
if the schools were capable of positive change.
   ``Business as usual must come to an end,'' Green told the
gathering at his inaugural, ``and it must do so today.''
   Green died early Wednesday, unexpectedly stricken by
asthma-related respiratory failure. He never got the chance to
duplicate his successes in Minneapolis _ reforms that persuaded
normally clannish New York educators to cast their lot with an
outsider.
   For much of his brief tenure in New York City's 939,000-child
school system, Green had to deal with scandal.
   An elementary school principal was arrested on drug charges.
Investigations into drug use, sexual harassment and job-selling by
members of community school boards led Green to suspend two boards.
   Children brought guns into class. Green installed metal
detectors at some shools and launched an anti-gun campaign.
   Green had little time to turn around the city's dropout problem
or institute concrete reforms. Still, there were successes.
   He trimmed the infamous central School Board bureaucracy by
one-fifth. He scored points with teachers and others with gestures
such as removing time clocks from schools.
   And anyone who saw Green with children and parents saw something
special and inspirational. Green, who could be shy and aloof, lit
up with children.
   ``He was very much a symbol for minority kids and parents,''
said Stanley Litow, who headed the search committee that offered
Green the New York job two winters ago.
   ``He was turning the corner,'' Litow said. ``He was beginning to
be much more on top of things, the who's who and what's what.''
   Asked at the beginning of last school year what his chief
accomplishments were, Green answered without apology: ``None.''
   He explained that he was still sizing up the problems in the
school system, that he was looking at long-term solutions and
wasn't interested in blowing his own horn.
   ``My mission, it may sound altruistic, is to serve children,''
he said. ``My eye is on that prize.''

   President Bush had a cyst treated on a right
finger during a routine physical examination on Wednesday, but
otherwise was pronounced ``in extremely sound physical condition''
by his doctor.
   The 64-year-old Bush, who had said he ``never felt better in my
life,'' underwent his first medical checkup as president at the
Bethesda Naval Medical Center in suburban Maryland.
   Shortly after Bush returned from the three-hour examination, the
White House press office issued a statement from his personal
physician, Dr. Burton Lee, giving the president a clean bill of
health.
   ``President Bush is in extremely sound physical condition,'' Lee
said. ``He keeps fit through a number of physical activities, which
we recommend he continue on a regular basis.''
   ``Today's examination shows him to be in excellent health. He
has no significant symptoms related to any of his organ systems,''
the statement said.
   It said a sebaceous cyst on the third finger of his right hand
was drained. ``The president is wearing a Band-Aid on the finger,
which he can remove within the next few hours,'' Lee said. ``This
cyst has been present for many years and does not present a medical
problem.''
   Rain forced Bush to travel to the hospital by motorcade, but he
flew back by helicopter. He sprang down the chopper steps and
jauntily waved at reporters and staff and headed straight to his
office to work.
   He smiled broadly and jabbed both thumbs skyward when they
shouted over the helicopter whirring to ask how he felt.
   He shook his head and waved off questions about his intentions
toward Panama as he strode across a soggy White House lawn to the
Oval Office.
   Today's statement said that a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram,
blood samples and a urinalysis all appeared normal.
   The checkup showed mild degenerative arthritis of the hip, but
the statement noted the condition ``has been present for several
years.''
   Today's examination was conducted under Lee's direction.
   Lee took several blood samples earlier this week which ``will be
analyzed as part of the examination,'' an earlier statement said.
   Speaking with a group of reporters Tuesday, the president was
asked about his health.
   ``Never felt better in my life,'' he said.
   However, Bush suffers from several physical ailments, including
a strong allergy to bee stings that requires him to receive regular
injections. He takes antihistamine pills for hay fever. He also has
mild arthritis of the hips and knees that has forced him to cut
down on his jogging.
   In addition to occasional jogs, Bush exercises by swimming,
playing tennis, pitching horseshoes and using an indoor bicycle and
treadmill.
   In 1986, Bush had a skin cancer removed from his face. He
suffered from duodenal ulcers, involving a section of his small
intestine, in 1960 and again in 1966.
   Despite his fondness for fat-laden pork rinds, Bush's
cholesterol at his last physical examination was 192, a level
considered desirable by the American Heart Association.
   The president is 6 foot 2 inches tall and weighs 195 pounds.
   Bush once told an interviewer his formula for keeping in shape
was: ``Don't eat too much, don't drink too much, and exercise.''
   Despite his overall good health, the president shortly after
taking office was plagued by the flu, which persisted for more than
two weeks and claimed his voice entirely for several days.

   The secretary-general of the governing party met
Wednesday with former Foreign Minister Masayoshi Ito to try to
persuade him to take the post of prime minister, but Ito refused.
   Ito said after the meeting he remains determined not to accept
the offer.
   Shintaro Abe, the Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general,
told Ito the party unanimously supports him to succeed Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita, Kyodo News Service and the Japan
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
   Takeshita announced April 25 that he would step down to assume
responsibility for a scandal involving the Recruit Co., an
information and publishing conglomerate accused of trying to buy
influence in the government by selling bargain-priced unlisted
stock in a subsidiary.
   Ito is one of the few senior Liberal Democratic Party members
not linked to Recruit. Three Cabinet members have resigned over
their links to the scandal.
   The news reports said Takeshita agreed to talk to Ito on
Thursday, and it quoted him as saying, ``Political reform is the
urgent need of the party, and we need to promote that under Mr.
Ito's leadership.''
   They also quoted Takeshita as saying he was willing to take his
time in efforts to persuade Ito.
   Ito, 75 and diabetic, has cited his age and health for not
wanting to replace Takeshita.
   But Japanese news reports have said he is holding out for
promises of major reforms. Party sources said that among other
things, Ito wants abolition of factions within the party and the
resignation of all politicians linked to the scandal.
   The Liberal Democratic Party is a group of about a half dozen
factions whose relative strengths and desires have to be considered
each time a Cabinet is formed. Because fundraising is a key part of
factions' efforts to boost their influence in the party,
factionalism is often said to be one cause of ``money politics.''
   In the absence of any other widely supported candidate, party
officials have said Ito is the ``only solution for the time being''
to a replacement for Takeshita.
   Leaders of four major opposition parties, however, have called
on Abe to have the Liberal Democrats hand over power to the
opposition. Abe refused, citing the Liberal Democrats' majority in
the House of Representatives. It holds 297 of the 512 seats.

   Police, ambulance crews and fire rescue
units that responded to a wreck overlooked a passenger thrown from
the car, and her body was found by her husband 18 hours later,
authorities said.
   After the car left the road and overturned near Portland
International Airport, the hospitalized driver did not tell
authorities there was a passenger, said Dave Simpson, a police
spokesman.
   Don Griffin of Gresham went looking for his wife when she failed
to return home. He found the body of Gina Griffin, 19, in tall
grass Tuesday afternoon, said Bob Felton, chief deputy medical
examiner.
   The body was about 150 feet from the accident site, said Tom
Steinman, Portland Fire Bureau emergency services coordinator.
   Griffin suffered serious head injuries, but the time and
official cause of her death remained undetermined.
   Police identified the driver as Teresa Barnes, 20.
   Griffin was not at home Wednesday and could not be reached
anywhere else, his sister, Barbara Griffin, said when she answered
the phone at his home. Asked if Teresa Barnes was living at the
same address, as police reported, she said, ``She was, but she
hasn't been here since (the accident).''
   Barnes, who could not be located for comment, was treated for
head contusions and released Tuesday, said Ken Strobeck, Emanuel
Hospital &amp; Health Center spokesman.

<HEAD>Labor Tries Comeback After Decade of Thatcherism</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LESLIE SHEPHERD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strengthened by favorable polls, a recent
electoral triumph and moves to scrap its unpopular ban-the-bomb
policy, the Labor Party suddenly is buoyed after a decade in the
political wilderness.
   Labor has lost three successive general elections to Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party, partly because its
policies projected a party in thrall to unrealistic left-wing
doctrine.
   This week, the party leadership decided to dump the ideology of
unilateral nuclear disarmament and adapt Labor's economic policies
to the prosperous 1980s.
   Opinion polls taken as Mrs. Thatcher celebrated 10 years in
office this month show Labor is regaining popularity and
credibility. Polls placed the two parties neck and neck.
   Labor Leader Neil Kinnock is gambling he can hold onto that
strength _ and his oft-criticized leadership _ in the two years
leading to the next election.
   Last week, Labor won a by-election for a Welsh parliamentary
seat the Tories had held for 38 years. The government dismissed it
as a routine midterm setback, but the sheer size of the
12.5-percent swing was a massive boost to Labor's spirits.
   Kinnock's risky strategy focuses on a wide-ranging review of
party doctrine ordered after the last electoral drubbing in 1987.
   On Tuesday, Kinnock persuaded Labor's ruling National Executive
to unshackle the party. It voted 17-8 for a new policy whereby a
Labor-led government would scrap Britain's independent nuclear
arsenal only in a negotiated arms control deal.
   Kinnock, a lifelong anti-nuclear campaigner, told party leaders
he no longer could publicly defend the policy.
   ``I am not going again to make that tactical argument for the
unilateral independent abandonment of nuclear weapons without
getting anything in return,'' he said.
   ``I will not do it and the majority of the people in the party
and in the country do not expect me to do it.''
   It was a thinly veiled threat to quit if he did not receive
backing. But Kinnock also went over the heads of the executives to
appeal directly to Labor's rank-and-file and the electorate at
large.
   Critics say the fundamental flaw in the new policy is that it
forecloses its options by declaring nuclear weapons are ``not a
deterrent and of no practical use.''
   The rider is intended to appease the hard-line left. But it
enables Tories to taunt Kinnock with the question, ``Would you
press the nuclear button?''
   Unless it is answered with a straight yes, critics say the new
policy is, in the words of Defense Secretary George Younger,
``about as effective as a feather duster.''
   Criticism also comes from commentators more friendly to Labor.
   Columnist Peter Jenkins said in The Independent newspaper that
all Kinnock need reply is that uncertainty is the essence of
deterrence. ``The trouble is that either he does not grasp the
theory of deterrence or he cannot believe in it,'' he wrote.
   Kinnock still faces a long, hot summer of trying to sell his new
policy, which must be approved by Labor's annual fall convention.
   He got a foretaste of trouble when Ron Todd, leader of the
Transport and General Workers' Union, declared his abiding faith in
unilateralism.
   ``They're not going to make me suddenly change the views that I
have held all over the years,'' Todd told Independent Television
News on Wednesday.
   Todd, whose 1.34 million-member union controls the largest bloc
vote at Labor conventions, said the party dumped unilateral nuclear
disarmament ``because people said it's not very popular.''
   But to Kinnock, the overriding priority is to beat Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``Out of power, we do not have the opportunities of unilateral
or any other sort of disarmament,'' he told the party Tuesday. ``In
power we can act and make dramatic progress.''

   The United States and the Soviet Union will resume
negotiations on strategic nuclear arms reductions next month, a
Soviet spokesman announced today, the start of talks between
visiting U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
said the next round of talks on nuclear and space weapons would
probably resume in Geneva on either June 12 or June 19 and last for
six weeks. He said the Soviets had wanted the negotiations to begin
again in May but that the Americans demurred.
   Baker had planned to propose the third week in June for the
reopening of the U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce the
superpowers' long-range bombers, nuclear submarines and
globe-girdling missles. The talks recessed in November.
   Gerasimov said the U.S. side explained that Richard Burt, who
has been nominated by President Bush to head the U.S. bargaining
team, probably would not be confirmed by the U.S. Senate in time to
resume talks this month.
   The two leaders met for almost three hours today after Baker's
arrival from Helsinki for his visit to the Soviet Union.
   The discussions began with regional issues, such as the Middle
East and Afghanistan, and included arms control, human rights,
regional problems and direct U.S.-Soviet relations.
   ``We are very pleased with the way things started,'' said Baker,
who is making his first trip to the Soviet Union.
   Gerasimov had told reporters earlier that at the request of the
U.S. side, Baker and Shevardnadze concentrated on regional
conflicts, rather than nuclear weapons.
   ``Dealing with regional problems will enable us to get the last
of the Cold War behind us and move into a new stage of our
relationship,'' Gerasimov said.
   He said the subject of short-range missiles in Europe, which has
caused a rift in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, did not
come up.
   The two sides found common ground on Central America, Gerasimov
said. ``Both sides stated there was good potential for a furthering
of dialogue on a Central American settlement,'' he said.
   Baker wants the Soviets to curb their aid to the Sandinistas in
Nicaragua, which amounted to $500 million last year. The Soviets
also raised Afghanistan, a topic Baker had no intention of bringing
up because the Kremlin is demanding the United States halt its
military aid to Afghan rebels.
   In both countries, Marxist governments have Soviet support,
while the United States is backing the insurgents _ with weapons
through Pakistan for the Mujahadeen and with non-lethal aid to the
Contras in Nicaragua.
   According to Gerasimov, Baker and Shevardnadze also discussed
U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's prediction that perestroika,
the restructuring program of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, would
fail.
   Baker explained that Cheney's remarks did not reflect
Washington's official position, and Shevardnadze did not take
offense, Gerasimov said.
   ``We understand that the secretary of defense needs more money
for military programs and how can he possibly obtain that if the
Soviet threat is going away?'' Gerasimov said. ``We were not
offended.''
   Baker, in the Soviet Union for the first time, later met with
three members of the Congress of People's Deputies, a new
parliament elected as Gorbachev gives greater powers to the
legislative arm of government.
   ``We think there are real changes taking place in the Soviet
Union, and we think those changes are more than cosmetic, as
demonstrated by the fact that we now see competitive elections,
looking towards a sitting legislature,'' Baker said at the meeting
at Spaso House, the U.S. ambassador's residence.
   The congress is to meet May 25 to choose a smaller, full-time
legislature, as well as a president. Asked if more than one
candidate should run for president, Baker said, ``One step at a
time.''
   In two days of talks, Baker is expected to turn to Gorbachev for
help in accelerating the fledling U.S. drive for Arab-Israeli
negotiations.
   The U.S. approach to the Middle East represents a shift in
diplomatic gears from two decades of trying to fence out both the
Soviet Union and the Palestine Liberation Organization as apt to
undermine American peace-making.
   Once before, in 1977, the United States made a concerted effort
to engage the Soviet Union in Middle East peace-making. The Carter
administration at that point was at a dead-end in its Mideast
diplomacy.
   But Egypt and Israel quickly decided to launch negotiations, and
the Soviets were shut out again.
   Egypt and Israel signed a peace treaty in 1979 and since then
have been the largest recipients of U.S. aid and solidly on the
American side of the superpower divide.
   But Baker is faced with a different situation. He is trying to
prod Israel into negotiations with the Palestinians and has
concluded he needs the support of both Moscow and the PLO.
   He is hoping the Soviets under Gorbachev would bring pressure on
Syria to support peace talks that do nothold out the promise of a
Palestinian state. The Soviet Union has refused to exert such power
in the past.
   The PLO, meanwhile, quietly has been assured that if Israeli
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for Palestinian elections does
not break the diplomatic stalemate in the Middle East the Bush
administration will look for alternatives.
   At the same time, Baker and his senior advisers are convinced
PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is sincere about his public acceptance
of Israel.
   If the Soviets push the missile issue they could widen the
fissures between the United States and West Germany over NATO's
nuclear arsenal.
   The Bush administration, supported mostly by Britain, wants to
enhance the range of the 88 Lance launchers and their 700 or so
missiles, most of which are in West Germany, while Chancellor
Helmut Kohl, backed by a majority of the alliance, is resisting and
calling for U.S.-Soviet negotiations on such weapons in Europe.
   By contrast, Baker is playing down arms control.
   He headed to Moscow with a proposed date _ the third week in
June _ for the reopening of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce the
superpowers' long-range bombers, nuclear submarines and
globe-girdling missiles.
   But he was not planning to outline the position the United
States would take at the table. Nor was he assuring the Soviets
that there would be no changes since the talks were recessed in
November.

   Democrats on House Ways and Means Committee
mounted an assault on President Bush's savings and loan bailout
plan in a move that also could upset a ``no new taxes''
deficit-reducing budget agreement between Congress and the White
House.
   Led by Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., members of the tax-writing
panel moved to include all of the $50 billion government infusion
of cash to cover S&amp;L failures in the fiscal 1989, 1990 and 1990
budgets.
   ``I have great ethical and moral problems with the way this
program is financed'' under Bush's plan, Gibbons said. ``This is a
mess that ought to be cleaned up without ... passing the costs on
to our children and grandchildren.''
   Bush would have included only the anticipated interest costs of
$3.5 billion over the three years in the budget by borrowing the
$50 billion through private maket bond sale instead of directly
through the U.S. Treasury.
   The plan involved closing or merging some 350 insolvent thrift
institutions that because of bad loans and often fraud have lost up
to $100 billion in federally insured deposits. Most of the money
would be used to cover those losses.
   The House and Senate last week approved a budget resolutions for
fiscal 1990 beginning next October that would trim this year's $160
billion deficit to just over $99 billion. Neither plan reflected
most of the bailout's costs, assuming it would be handled ``off
budget'' as Bush proposed.
   ``We've fairly well destroyed the budget agreement between the
administration and Congress,'' Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.,
complained Tuesday.
   Gibbons' alternative adds $10 billion to this year's deficit and
potentially $25 billion in fiscal 1990, ending any hope of meeting
the Gramm-Rudman deficit target of $100 billion then without
spending cuts elsewhere or an increase in taxes.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady spent more than an hour behind
closed doors with members of the committee, trying to convince them
to go along with Bush's plan and repeating a threat that he would
urge the president to veto it if they didn't.
   He left the meeting smiling. But when asked by reporters if
Bush's plan had sufficient support in the committee, he said only,
``You never know about that. We'll have to wait and see.''
   Gibbons led the attack on the administration's plan after the
panel's chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesday that
he would not mount an offensive against it.
   Senate Democrats also had pushed for handling the cost of the
bailout _ which, including interest, is expected to exceed more
than $250 billion over the next 30 years _ directly.
   But they stopped short of forcing a showdown after the White
House and Brady threatened a veto and said it would upset then
on-going negotiations on reducing the deficit through spending cuts
in defense and domestic programs in order to fulfill Bush's
campaign pledge of ``No new taxes.''
   A confrontations with Bush over the S&amp;L financing would have
stopped ``dead in its tracks'' the budget accord that had been
negotiated over three months, said Senate Budget Committee Chairman
James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Frenzel, who led the support for Bush's plan, said changing it
will only force a veto that will ``prolong the crisis and allow
(S&amp;L) institutions to keep on making bad loans.''
   Actually, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has taken control
of more than half of the 350 most troubled thrifts in the past
three months and stopped some of their riskier lending activities.
But losses are still mounting at a rate of $10 million a day
because of past bad loans, according to the administration.
   Frenzel also echoed the administration's arguments in contending
that waiving the Gramm-Rudman deficit target will open the door for
increased government spending and drive all interest rates up.
   ``Once the credit market understand that we are willing to
breach Gramm-Rudman, they will understand that we are willing to
breach it for toxic waste cleanups, homelessness or whatever comes
down the pike,'' he said.
   Democats, however, seemed willing to force a veto showdown.
   ``There's not going to be a delay unless the administration
wants a delay,'' said Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif. ``It will be up
to the president to sign the bill or not sign it.''
   The Democratic alternative retains the same Resolution Financing
Corp. that Bush would establish for raising the $50 billion _ $6
billion of it from the industry and the rest borrowed. The industry
also would have to pay $300 annually for 30 years as its share of
the bailout.
   However, the financing corporation would have to borrow the
balance through the Treasury or the Federal Financing Bank rather
than via the private bond market.
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates the savings in lower
interest rates that have to be paid through direct Treasury
borrowing will total $671 million over the first five years, $1.5
billion by the year 2000 and $4.5 billion over 30 years.

   The Town Council in this winter resort
is shunning the spotlight, endorsing a move to limit filmmaking to
seven days a month.
   The town already restricts filmmaking to the off-season months
of April to November, when many residents go back north. But the
measure given preliminary approval Tuesday on a 3-2 vote would
further limit filming on grounds of preserving public safety.
   Town Attorney John Randolph warned that the measure might not
stand up to a court challenge, but council members weren't
dissuaded.
   ``This is Palm Beach. This is not a sound stage,'' said council
member Bernard Heeke.
   ``What if they're half through on the seventh day? Will we say
go home?'' asked council member William Weinberg, one of the
opponents.
   ``Yes,'' shot back council President Nancy Douthit. ``Because
they're notorious time wasters.''

<HEAD>Government Proposes Legislation Against Money-Laundering</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government Wednesday announced
draft legislation that would make money-laundering a crime.
   The proposal, expected to be presented to Parliament before
mid-June, is aimed at combatting drug-trafficking and organized
crime, said Justice Minister Arnold Koller.
   Switzerland's financial and political communities have been
rocked by the ``Lebanon Connection'' scandal in which investigators
say about $1.2 billion, including alleged drug money, was recycled
through Swiss banks.
   The case led to the resignation of the former justice minister,
Elizabeth Kopp, after it was revealed she tipped off her husband to
sever his links with Shakarchi Trading, a Lebanese-controlled,
Zurich-based company under investigation.
   The legislation would outlaw those acts that obstruct the
investigation of the ``origin, the tracing, or the seizure'' of
assets known to have come from illegal activities.
   Violators would be punished by up to five years in prison and a
fine of up to $600,000.
   A second part of the proposed law would punish bankers, lawyers,
financial advisers and banknote traders for lack of care if they

Offenders face up to a year in prison.
   The draft law was greeted by three of the four parties making up
the government coalition and was cautiously welcomed by the banks.
The Social Democratic Party said it did not go far enough.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Urges Refuge for Vietnamese</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Tops with 10 grafs new or recast to include Senate panel action,
picks up pvs graf 3, ``The legislation''</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday approved a resolution urging Southeast Asian nations to
resume providing refuge for asylum-seeking Vietnamese.
   Meantime, a House subcommittee endorsed a resolution urging
Vietnam to speed the emigration to America of thousands of people
sent to ``re-education'' camps because of their ties to the former
pro-U.S. government of South Vietnam.
   The Senate panel's resolution is directed to members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and seeks to state U.S.
policy before an international conference on Indochinese refugees
is held next month in Geneva under auspices of the United Nations.
   The resolution, sent to the full Senate, states that ASEAN has
announced a policy of screening all asylum-seekers to determine
their refugee status. It says Vietnam has ``demonstrated its
hostility to those leaving Vietnam illegally and, in particular, to
those refusing to return to Vietnam voluntarily.''
   The resolution declares that ASEAN should reinstate the practice
of providing ``adequate refuge'' for all Vietnamese seeking asylum
while carrying out their screening.
   It calls for early access for the United Nation's High
Commissioner for Refugees to provide humane care and protection to
those seeking asylum.
   The resolution states that no Vietnamese seeking asylum should
be sent back to their homeland without guarantees they will not be
persecuted.
   ``Given Vietnamese attitudes toward illegal departure, forced
repatriation of refugees to Vietnam should not be considered a
viable option,'' the resolution declares.
   And it says the United States should ``remain committed to a
generous and humane Southeast Asian refugee resettlement policy.''
   Meantime, a resolution approved by voice vote of the House
subcommittee on Asian and Pacific affairs, and sent to the full
House Foreign Affairs Committee for further action, says that the
willingness of Vietnam's government to ``satisfactorily resolve
this humanitarian issue'' involving emigration will have ``an
important bearing'' on U.S.-Vietnamese relations.
   The legislation noted that the United States ``has made it
clear'' to Hanoi that it is ready to allow those detained because
of loyalty to the Saigon government to enter the United States.
South Vietnam collapsed in 1975.
   The United States and Vietnam agreed in principle last July on
the U.S. resettlement of ``re-education'' detainees and their
families but Hanoi later suspended negotiations, the resolution
said. It asked Hanoi to resume talks and to publish the names of
and to release those still in ``re-education'' camps, as well as
dissidents arrested for non-violent political or religious activity.
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., wrote the resolution, which has been
co-sponsored by 32 other members of both parties.

<HEAD>Louisiana Priest's Fast Wins Equipment For Health Center</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELIZABETH LOVE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fast by a Louisiana priest to
protest government delays in finishing a health clinic for peasants
Wednesday prompted officials to begin installing new equipment.
   ``It's a minor miracle. They're bringing in everything from
X-ray machines and hospital beds to fluorescent lights,'' said the
Rev. Donald Bahlinger, who began his fast Friday.
   The 60-year-old Roman Catholic priest from Baton Rouge said he
would continue his meals of bread and water for one more day ``as a
way of thanking God.''
   Bahlinger camped out on the first floor of the empty health
center in San Ignacio, Misiones, 135 miles southeast of Asuncion.
   Although the 35-bed hospital building was finished in 1981, it
remained an empty shell until this week. Critics blamed official
corruption and inefficiency during the regime of Gen. Alfredo
Stroessner, who was ousted Feb. 3.
   His last health minister, Adan Godoy Jimenez, is in jail facing
charges that include overcharging the government for building
health centers, dozens of which never were properly equipped or
staffed.
   San Ignacio residents were cared for in a run-down, six-bed
veterans' hospital where three beds in one room were reserved for
maternity cases and three in another room were for any ill men,
women or children.
   ``We would ask authorities if we could just use some rooms in
the new hospital as dormitories and they would tell us we couldn't
use them until it was inaugurated, and they couldn't inaugurate it
because it wasn't equipped,'' said Bahlinger.
   Hundreds of residents turned out to support Bahlinger with
Masses and a silent march during his fast.
   ``One of the things that really made it click was the support of
the people,'' said Bahlinger, who came to Paraguay eight years ago
to serve as parish priest in San Ignacio.
   Late Tuesday, two loaded flatbed trucks pulled up at the
hospital, and Assistant Health Minister Ruben Mayorquin asked
Bahlinger to bless the new equipment.
   ``It turned into a real fiesta with close to 1,000 people
singing, chanting and applauding,'' said the Rev. Leo Leise, a
fellow Jesuit from New Orleans.
   The first patient to be treated in the new hospital is a
30-year-old mother of five suffering from cancer, who was turned
away from the old veterans clinic.
   ``She regained consciousness and seems to be in good spirits.
They have her in a nice room now,'' said Bahlinger.

<HEAD>Racist Government Abolished; Police Arrested In Killing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The South African-imposed racist system
of government was abolished Wednesday in preparation for November
elections leading to independence for this mineral-rich territory.
   In a separate development, police announced Wednesday they
arrested two white policemen suspected in the shooting of a
van-load of civilian supporters of the black nationalist South-West
Africa People's Organization.
   Louis Pienaar, Namibia's South African-appointed
administrator-general, issued a proclamation Thursday transferring
all executive and legislative powers of government to himself.
   The proclamation leaves in place such institutions as racially
segregated schools. In effect, government activities still will be
conducted on a racial basis because the administrative arms of
racially separated regional and municipal entities will remain in
operation.
   Rehoboth regional government, in the area of the mixed-race
Basters people, is the only one unaffected. Rehoboth has had a
special semiautonomous status since 1870, and is governed by a
South African law which is being repealed.
   The Rehoboth government and whites-only National Party of South
Africa oppose the U.N. independence plan for Namibia and have
refused to vacate their offices.
   South Africa, which has controlled Namibia for 74 years, agreed
to implement the U.N. plan in a three-way regional accord that
includes withdrawing 50,000 Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's
northern neighbor.
   The South African-led territorial police announced Wednesday
they arrrested two policemen in northern Namibia suspected in the
April 2 shooting of SWAPO supporters. Seven people were injured,
and one, 26-year-old David Indongo, died Tuesday from a bullet
wound in the back. The police did not identify the suspects.
   According to reports, two white men in a car opened fire on the
van carrying civilians home from a rally in Windhoek, the capital,
where they had celebrated the beginning of the independence process
April 1.
   South Africa says about 1,600 SWAPO guerrillas crossed into
northern Namibia starting April 1, violating an agreement they
would remain temporarily at bases in Angola. Most of the guerrillas
have withdrawn following clashes that South African officials say
left 27 security force members and 314 SWAPO fighters dead.
   The guerrillas are to return, unarmed, with thousands of other
Namibians who fled the territory during SWAPO's 23-year bush war
against South African occupation. The repatriation will start May
22, a week later than scheduled, and be completed by June 30, the
territory's National Health Secretary Louwrence Erasmus said
Wednesday.
   He said the government, churches and U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees expect nearly 58,000 refugees.

<HEAD>Exxon Increases Cleanup Crew; Coast Guard Still Doubts Success by
Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., told by the White House to pour
more resources into its Alaska oil cleanup, said Wednesday it would
deploy 1,600 additional workers as well as more boats and barges in
the effort.
   The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Paul A. Yost Jr., told a Senate
hearing that despite the increase, it will be ``almost impossible''
to clean all the oil from more than 300 miles of shoreline by the
target date of Sept. 15.
   However, Exxon USA President William D. Stevens told openly
skeptical senators the company ``fully expects to clean up'' the
beaches by that date, after which poor weather is likely to make
efforts impossible.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Exxon had pledged
``a substantial increase'' in manpower and resources, nearly
doubling the cleanup efforts by the company whose tanker spilled 11
millions of oil into Alaska waters last March.
   The Exxon announcement came after company executives were told
in a meeting at the White House on Monday that their summer cleanup
plans were inadequate.
   Skinner, who along with White House chief of staff John Sununu
had met with the Exxon officials, said even with the additional
resources it remains uncertain whether Exxon will be able to finish
by September.
   ``It's a massive, massive effort. Exxon has got a big
challenge,'' Skinner told reporters, adding that he plans to ``hold
their feet to the fire'' to finish the job. If the cleanup is not
completed in September, he said, he expects Exxon to renew the
effort next spring.
   Yost, of the Coast Guard, sounded pessimistic about quick
results in his testimony before a Senate Commerce, Science and
Transportation subcommittee.
   He told of his hands dripping with oil after reaching under the
gravel on a beach that had been cleaned for 10 consecutive days by
200 workers. He said increasing personnel will not prevent oil from
washing back onto the beaches.
   Asked by Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., if the oil giant was
trying to ``stonewall'' the cleanup, Yost said, ``That's one view
of it. Mine would be slightly more sympathetic. I think the job is
so extensive, and the damage so serious, the amount of equipment
that can be operated in that weather so small'' that Exxon is now
doing ``the most that can be done.''
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William
Sound on March 24 spilling a quarter of its oil into the pristine
waters of the sound in the worst oil spill in U.S. history. Within
days the oil spread down the southern Alaska coast causing
environmental and economic havoc.
   Cleanup costs have been estimated at anywhere from $100 million
to $400 million by the time the oil is cleared _ by hand or by
high-powered water hoses _ and wildlife and the natural habitat
affected by the pollution is restored.
   Exxon's Stevens, confronted with figures showing only 1.7 miles
have been cleaned, said the work started slowly because the company
tackled the worst beaches first.
   But Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., told Stevens that Exxon's
performance has been so poor that he ``should be drawing
unemployment compensation.''
   Earlier this week, Bush administration officials expressed
concern that Exxon's plans did not commit enough resources to the
effort this summer. Those concerns were reiterated by Skinner and
Sununu at the meeting with Exxon officials at the White House
Monday and in a letter to Exxon from the Coast Guard.
   In response, Exxon said Wednesday it will increase the number of
people to be involved in the summer cleanup from a previously
planned 3,400 workers to 5,000, a move the company said will allow
it to put 2,500 people directly to work on the beaches. The company
also said it will deploy seven more barges and 17 more landing
craft than previously planned, bringing the total number of barges
and boats to 70.
   Exxon currently has more than 6,000 people working in Alaska in
connection with the spill. The manpower increase to 5,000 workers
pertains to those actually involved in the shoreline cleanup.
   After saying the cleanup should be completed by Sept. 15,
Stevens said the company would return in the spring ``to assure
that the job has been properly done.''

<TEXT>
   Marc Bohan, the couturier who has designed clothes
for the House of Dior for 28 years, is leaving as artistic director
of the worldwide fashion company, Christian Dior announced
Wednesday.
   Bohan, 62, joined the company three years after the death of
Christian Dior in 1957.
   ``He has had a long career with Dior,'' said company spokesman
Jane Cattani. ``He will continue to work with the house. He will be
creating a new foundation for the House of Dior.''
   Ms. Cattani would give no further details concerning Bohan's
replacement or the new foundation, promising more details Thursday.
   The company praised ``the talent and the creativity of Marc
Bohan who has always maintained the quality of creation and the
prestige of the image of Christian Dior at its highest level.''
   After Dior's death, Yves Saint Laurent took over for two years,
then founded his own fashion house. Bohan came in, showing his
first collection under the Dior name in 1960.
   Under Bohan, Dior expanded into luxury ready-to-wear, clothes
for men and children, and sold licenses for all sorts of
accessories and household goods from belts and scarves to sheets,
with the Dior label.
   Bohan also has designed costumes for the opera, theater and
cinema.
   He twice received the Golden Thimble, an award given each season
to the best haute couture collection.

<HEAD>Congress Asked to Let States Tax Out-of-State Mail Orders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With their eyes on revenue of at least $1.5
billion a year, representatives of state and local government asked
Congress Wednesday to require that taxes be collected on mail-order
sales to out-of-state residents.
   Under a 22-year-old Supreme Court decision, a state may not
require an out-of-state merchant to collect sales taxes unless the
merchant has a retail outlet in the state. A bill introduced by
Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, would require only that a company regularly solicit
business in a state before the state could require that taxes be
collected.
   Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota, speaking for the National
Governors' Association, said present law is unfair to local
merchants because it allows their competitors to undercut prices by
the value of sales taxes, which range from 5 percent to 8 percent.
That, Sinner said, is greater than most merchants' average profit
margin.
   ``A 5 percent sales advantage is overwhelming the Main Street
retailer,'' he told a news conference. ``That is why the National
Governors' Association and other state government groups are
joining with a new coalition of retail and labor groups to end this
competitive interstate disadvantage.''
   Across Capitol Hill, opponents of Brooks' bill were having their
say.
   ``This will have the maximum irritation effect on tens of
millions of consumers who would have to do the tax calculations
every time they order,'' said Robert Levering, vice president of
the Direct Marketing Association.
   ``If this legislation were to pass, direct marketers would be
saddled with tax collection duties for over 7,000 municipal and
state tax jurisdictions,'' he said. ``That means we can be audited
by every one of those jurisdictions, even where our companies don't
have physical presence (in a state) and don't receive benefits.''
   Sen. Robert W. Kasten Jr., R-Wis., who is leading the fight
against Brooks' bill, said it ``unfairly targets the elderly, the
handicapped, farm families and the millions of consumers who rely
on mail-order purchases for many of their basic needs.''
   Kasten's state is home to Land's End, one of the nation's
largest catalog suppliers of clothing.
   Here is the problem created by present law:
   If a Wisconsin woman buys a $20 blouse from a Land's End catalog
or from a hometown store, she pays the 5 percent Wisconsin sales
tax. If a Tennessee woman buys the same blouse from Land's End, she
pays no sales tax; if she buys it in her hometown, she pays
Tennessee's 5{ percent tax plus any local sales tax.
   Brooks' bill would require that out-of-state mail-order and
telephone-order companies _ including the popular television
shopping shows _ collect sales taxes from out-of-state customers
only if the firms have annual sales above $12.5 million.
   Sinner said that would exempt from collection about 95 percent
of mail-order companies. The remaining 5 percent account for 70
percent of mail-order sales, he said.
   State officials estimate enactment of Brooks' bill would bring
state and local governments more than $1.5 billion a year.

<TEXT>
   The Chrysler Corp., has agreed in two separate
actions to recall nearly 600,000 1984-model through 1987-model
vehicles because they do not meet federal pollution requirements,
the Environmental Protection Agency said Wednesday.
   The EPA said one recall involves 127,000 1984-model cars that
were found to exceed federal carbon monoxide exhaust emission
standards. The action involves the Chrysler E Class, New Yorker,
LeBaron, Laser, Laser XE, Dodge 600 and Daytona.
   At the same time, the EPA said the automaker also has agreed to
issue a recall of 468,000 vans, wagons, pickup trucks and sports
utility vehicles covering the 1984 through 1987 model years to fix
a gasoline vapor control valve.
   The EPA said the vehicles exceed the federal standards for
pollution caused by the escape of gasoline vapors from the fuel
system and engine. Such vapors are a contributor to smog and other
air pollution.
   The agency said the automaker had agreed to make an adjustment
in the carburetor bowl-vent valve, which controls the release of
gasoline vapors.

<HEAD>Rafsanjani Says His Call For Anti-West Attacks Was Misinterpreted</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iranian Parliament Speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani sought Wednesday to distance himself from an
inflammatory call for Palestinians to kill Americans and other
Westerners, saying his remarks were misinterpreted.
   In an interview on Tehran Radio, Rafsanjani said he was ``only
analyzing'' the Middle East situation, and did not ``mean to
condone the killing of innocent civilians.''
   In his prayer sermon at Tehran University on Friday, Rafsanjani
called on Palestinians to kill Westerners, hijack planes and bomb
Western interests.
   ``Of course, maybe my tone was such that it was taken to mean
that I was recommending such action. Maybe my tone was such, but I
meant it as an interpretation,'' Rafsanjani said in an interview
with Tehran Radio, monitored in Nicosia.
   In Friday's sermon, Rafsanjani had urged Palestinians to
``declare open war on American targets.''
   He had said: ``If for every Palestinian martyred in Palestine,
they kill five Americans, Britons or Frenchmen outside, the
Zionists would not dare continue these wrongs.''
   ``Why don't you hijack planes to swap prisoners in Israeli
hands, or blow up prisoners?'' advised Rafsanjani, who so far is
Iran's only presidential candidate for summer elections.
   His sermon was seen as an attempt to distance himself from a
clique that sought to build bridges with the West until recent
weeks, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini moved decisively to
strengthen the hand of hard-liners.
   Rafsanjani's remarks triggered strong criticism in a West
already incensed by Khomeini's religious edict calling on Moslems
to kill British writer Salman Rushdie for his book, ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Many Moslems say the book blasphemes Islam.
   The United States, France and Britain accused Tehran of inciting
murder through Rafsanjani's sermon.
   Rafsanjani told Tehran radio he found the U.S., British and
French reaction ``very interesting.''
   He said the West was looking for a new issue ``to make up for
their defeat in the Salman Rushdie affair.'' He claimed an
anti-Islamic campaign after Khomeini's edict was foiled by the
support of Moslems all over the world.
   Britain and its 11 European Community partners withdrew their
ambassadors from Tehran after Khomeini's Feb.15 declaration. Some
since have returned.
   Rafsanjani told the radio Wednesday: ``The statements I made
were my own opinion. I presented an individual opinion which wasn't
new ... Other officials may or may not agree with my opinions.''
   Rafsanjani said the Israeli crackdown on Palestinians in the
occupied territories ``is the worst kind of terrorism.''
   He told Tehran Radio he believed ``their actions will lead to
the killing of Westerners'' whose governments, he said, back Israel.
   Rafsanjani concluded: ``If the Americans don't want terrorism,
then they must hit at the roots of it ... They must not allow
Israel to do what it does. If they don't, then the other things
will automatically follow.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration asked Congress on
Wednesday for funds to enable the Inter-American Development Bank
to lend $22.5 billion to Western Hemisphere countries by 1993.
   The U.S. contribution would be $78 million a year. Only 2.5
percent of the proposed increase in the bank's capital is paid in,
with the rest remaining ``on call'' but not expected to be needed.
   David C. Mulford, assistant secretary of the Treasury for
international affairs, said the bank will begin making loans to
help change borrower countries' policies in whole sectors such as
agriculture. Past lending has been for specific projects, such as
dams, roads or schools.
   Sector loans are disbursed quickly so they can also help a
borrowing country meet interest payments on old loans which amount
to more than $400 billion and will not be directly affected by the
new ones.
   Regarding the debt problem, the bank's present role is ``to
encourage the borrowers to adopt policies that improve economic
performance, stimulate new foreign investment, increase domestic
savings and encourage the repatriation of flight capital,'' Mulford
said.
   Mulford's request for funds came after three years of
negotiation to get more power for the United States and other
contributing countries over the bank's lending policies. They can
now delay a loan for as long as a year.
   ``The intent and design of the new loan approval mechanism is to
foster a ... consensus in support of loans and thereby improve loan
quality,'' Mulford said.
   He appeared before the subcommittee on international economic
policy of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

<HEAD>Former FDA Official Says Favoritism Common in Generic Drug Division</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former FDA supervisor accused of taking
bribes told Congress in an affidavit Wednesday that favoritism was
common in the generic drug division of the agency.
   Charles Y. Chang, a former branch chief in the Food and Drug
Administration's Division of Generic Drugs, said special handling
of applications resulted partly from pressure by the larger, more
sophisticated companies.
   Favoritism, he said, ``was not necessarily the result of illegal
behavior, but reflected, in part, highly personal, arbitrary and
often arrogant management.''
   He also referred to examples of special treatment of
applications and said they ``were the result of continuous pressure
put on the division, at all levels, by the industry through
lobbying, conducted by executives, lawyers, consultants, and
occasionally through political channels inside and outside the
FDA.''
   Chang was charged Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Baltimore
with two counts of interstate travel in aid of racketeering. He was
accused of accepting a free trip to Hong Kong and furniture as
bribes from American Therapeutics Inc., a Bohemia, N.Y., generic
drug manufacturer.
   Each charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison
and a $250,000 fine upon conviction.
   Another FDA employee and a drug company executive were charged
last month in the wide-ranging investigation of allegations of
bribery in the generic drugs division. More charges are expected.
   Officials in the office of the Inspector General at the Health
and Human Services Department, of which FDA is a part, have said
there is no indication that impropriety at the agency has resulted
in unsafe or ineffective drugs being placed on the market. Chang
echoed that assessment in his affidavit.
   Chang said in the document, dated Tuesday, that he could not
discuss ``matters under active criminal investigation,'' but said
he would continue to cooperate with the House Energy and Commerce
investigations subcommittee, which has been looking into the FDA's
generic drug approval process.
   The panel released his affidavit at a hearing Wednesday.
   In the affidavit, he said favoritism helped speed the processing
of applications, usually those of the larger drug manufacturing
companies. He said he sometimes tried to counteract the special
treatment by helping to expedite reviews of applications submitted
by smaller companies.
   Chang said favoritism occurred because of poor management and
lax enforcement of the few FDA rules governing reviews of generic
drug applications.
   Larry D. Morey, an assistant inspector general at HHS, testified
that his office is looking into allegations that 15 FDA employees
received subsidized accommodations during meetings in Puerto Rico
sponsored by the National Association of Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers, an association of generic drug companies.
   Morey said such subsidies are considered illegal, but he said
the U.S. attorney's office has declined to prosecute. The results
of the inspector general's investigation will be referred to the
FDA for administrative action, he said. Sanctions could include
dismissal, he said.

   Former prosecutor Rudolph W. Giuliani canceled
plans to announce his Republican mayoral candidacy Wednesday,
citing the death of city schools Chancellor Richard Green.
   ``Chancellor Green was a hard-working public servant who had
dedicated his career to helping children,'' Giuliani said in a
statement. ``He was a very decent man. New Yorkers are in his
debt.''
   Giuliani, 44, said he was postponing his announcement ``out of
respect for the memory of Chancellor Green and for his family.''
   Campaign spokesman Charles Perkins said Giuliani's announcement
would be rescheduled after Green's funeral arrangements were known.
   Polls have consistently shown Giuliana defeating incumbent Mayor
Edward I. Koch or any other likely Democratic nominee in a
hypothetical matchup.

   Authorities on Wednesday arrested
the former head of a West German company and said he was suspected
of a ``leading role'' in building a Libyan plant allegedly intended
to produce chemical weapons.
   West German and U.S. authorities alleged that the company,
Imhausen-Chemie, was the key supplier of material for the plant in
the Libyan city of Rabta. Libya claimed the plant was for making
pharmaceuticals, but U.S. and West German officials claim it was
intended to manufacture chemical weapons.
   Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen, who was chief of Imhausen-Chemie
until March, was arrested Wednesday in the city of Bochum, said
prosecutor Holger Preisendanz in a telephone interview.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen is ``strongly suspected'' of violating West
German export laws, said the Mannheim prosecutor, who heads the
investigation.
   In a separate statement, Preisendanz said ``there is the strong
suspicion that the accused, Dr. Juergen Hippenstiel-Imhausen
himself, had a leading role in the planning and construction of the
plant in Rabta, Libya, that was intended for the production of
chemical weapons.''
   Although the statement referred to Hippenstiel-Imhausen as ``the
accused,'' he has not been charged with any crimes.
   The ARD television network reported Wednesday that authorities
also were investigating Hippenstiel-Imhausen for possible tax law
violations.
   Hippenstiel-Imhausen is the first person to be arrested in the
investigation into the scandal that strained relations between
Washington and Bonn earlier this year.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government in January initially denied
West German companies were involved in the Rabta project, but later
acknowledged widespread West German participation, setting off a
backlash that embarrassed his coalition government.
   The dispute over the plant rekindled tensions between the United
States and Libyan leader Col. Moammar Gadhafi. The plant is 60
miles south of Tripoli.
   Preisendanz said prosecutors, police and customs inspectors had
searched the offices of Imhausen-Chemie in the southwestern town of
Lahr and its subsidiary, the Gesellschaft fuer Automation in Bochum.
   ``The arrest is in connection with the probe into the Libyan
plant,'' the prosecutor said.
   He said that further arrests could not be ruled out, but added:
``I don't see any cause for that right now.''
   Preisendanz emphasized authorities also decided to arrest
Hippenstiel-Imhausen to prevent him from fleeing the country.
   Imhausen officials said in January that Hippenstiel-Imhausen and
his family had gone into hiding after receiving death threats.
   In Bochum, judicial authorities released a statement saying they
were concerned Hippenstiel-Imhausen might have been trying to hide
evidence needed for the investigation.

<BYLINE>By ROLAND PRINZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Miklos Nemeth on Wednesday
criticized the 32-year leadership of former party chief Janos Kadar
and denounced the Communist Party's past monopoly on political
affairs.
   Kadar said he may have made mistakes but that he meant well.
   Parliament approved changes recommended by Nemeth that installed
six new Cabinet members expected to speed the pace of reform.
   The move came a day after the policy-making Central Committee
offered to negotiate democratic reforms with opposition groups.
Similar talks have brought about a more democratic electoral system
in Poland and legalized Solidarity there.
   The party said the new talks could include all registered
opposition groups and focus on an exact date for next year's
multiparty elections, a new constitutional court, the powers of a
new state presidency and a new electoral law.
   A leader of one of the new independent political groups, Karoly
Ravasz of the Smallholders Party, said his initial response to the
offer was positive.
   He said the leaders of eight opposition groups planned to meet
to decide on a common strategy for replying to the offer.
   In a speech to Parliament, Nemeth suggested the Budapest
leadership is caught in an impasse.
   ``The conservative forces are unable to turn the clock back, but
the reform forces are still unable to attain a decisive turn,''
Nemeth said. He said the situation is not conducive to a coalition
with non-communist groups, ``although I would liked to see this
come about.''
   Nemeth gave the most critical appraisal yet of the Kadar years,
although he did not mention the longtime leader by name.
   Kadar, 76, rose to power behind the Soviet-led invasion of 1956
that crushed a popular uprising. On Monday, he was removed from the
Central Committee and stripped of the honorary post of party
president.
   In another sign that the party is opening up about the past, the
state news agency MTI on Wednesday published for the first time the
names of all 277 people it said were executed after the 1956 revolt.
   ``Hitherto, government decisions have been almost exclusively
based on party decisions,'' Nemeth said. ``The activities of the
government were accompanied by the least possible openness.''
   ``Not only did the government not accept Parliament as a
supervisory body, but it did not accept Parliament as an equal
partner either,'' he said, referring to the Parliament's longtime
role as a rubber-stamp body.
   Nemeth blamed Kadar's economic policies for the crisis facing
Hungary now. The rise in living standards in the 1970s was based on
massive borrowing, resulting in a $17 billion foreign debt that
requires further loans of up to $3 billion annually to cover the
interest.
   Replying to a letter from the Central Committee that echoed
Nemeth's criticism, Kadar said he was sure he had made mistakes but
added that ``all of my actions were guided by good intentions.''
   The letter, dated Wednesday, was made public by MTI. In it,
Kadar also said his health ``took a turn for the worse'' in April,
but he did not elaborate.
   At a news conference, Nemeth introduced his new Cabinet members
and said all are reform-minded.
   They are Foreign Minister Gyula Horn, 57; Finance Minister
Laszlo Bekesi, 46; Industry Minister Ferenc Horvath, 46;
Agriculture Minister Csaba Huetter, 45; Culture Minister Ferenc
Glatz, 48, and Ernoe Kemenes, 48, head of the planning office.
   Horn replaces Peter Varkonyi at the Foreign Ministry. Varkonyi
has been named to be the next ambassador to the United States. The
others replaced in the 17-member Cabinet will be retired or
transferred to other government jobs.

Month</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union reached
tentative agreement Wednesday to reopen negotiations next month to
reduce their arsenals of globe-girdling nuclear missiles and took
steps to cooperate in easing conflicts in the Middle East and
Central America.
   Both American and Soviet officials gave a positive account of
the first trip to Moscow by Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
and a formal announcement of a date for the arms control
negotiations is expected Thursday when he meets with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Headway in an expanding and more conciliatory relationship was
especially evident in Baker's discussion of the Middle East with
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. He assured Baker,
according to a senior U.S. official, that Israel's U.S.-blessed
proposal to hold elections among the 1.4 million Palestinian Arabs
on the West Bank and Gaza was ``worthy of attention.''
   And when Baker pressed him to resume full diplomatic relations
with Israel after a 22-year lapse, Shevardnadze gave him ``an
encouraging but not a definitive response,'' the official said,
giving an account of their nearly three hours of talks on condition
of anonymity.
   On Central America, meanwhile, Shevardnadze told Baker there was
``a good basis for dialogue and opportunity to find a cooperative
agreement'' to bring peace to the region, the official said.
   Baker, summarizing his first day in Moscow after addressing a
group of Soviet human rights activists, including Jews denied visas
to emigrate, said: ``We had good discussions, in-depth discussions,
particularly on regional issues.''
   A prominent Soviet official, Alexander Bessmertnyk, the first
deputy foreign minister, said the talks were conducted in ``a
businesslike, constructive and, on the whole, good and calm
atmosphere.''
   Typifying the bracing atmosphere, the Soviets did not bring up
the divisive issue of short-range nuclear missiles that has pit the
United States against West Germany, with some members of the
Western alliance lining up with the Bush administration in trying
to extend their range and others backing Chancellor Helmut Kohl in
calling for U.S. negotiations with Moscow.
   There was virtually no evidence of discord, although the
American side was clearly irritated with Soviet refusal to condemn
Iranian calls for attacks on Americans. Shevardnadze explained that
Moscow, which shares a long common border with Iran, was trying to
be on good terms with its neighbor.
   The sweep of the talks, which included separate meetings of
mixed working group on arms control, regional issues, human rights
and direct U.S.-Soviet relations, reflected a broadening discourse
and less of a focus on curbing the nuclear arms race.
   But Baker's suggestion for a resumption of talks on a strategic
arms reduction treaty in mid-June struck a positive chord. The
Soviets had been eager to resume the talks that were recessed last
November, but President Bush ordered a delay while U.S. weapons
policies were reviewed.
   Baker suggested the negotiations be reopened the week of June
18, and a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
the Soviets would agree to June 19 or June 20.
   Gennady Gerasimov, the Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
the talks would resume on either June 12 or June 19, with the first
round to last six weeks. He said the Soviets had wanted to get
started in May but the United States had demurred.
   The Reagan administration had agreed tentatively to resume in
mid-February.
   The negotiators have some tough problems to grapple with, as
they try to reduce by 30 to 50 percent U.S. and Soviet arsenals of
long-range bombers, submarines and land-based missiles that can
span oceans and continents. Among the issues are whether to try to
restrict mobile missiles and how to verify such elusive weapons as
cruise missiles fired from airplanes and submarines.
   On human rights, Baker departed from the practice of his
predecessor, George P. Shultz, and did not start out his meeting
with Shevardnadze on the subject. But a U.S. official said human
rights still had ``pride of place'' on the superpower agenda, and
Baker elicited from Shevardnadze a description of the changes the
Soviets are making in their legal code.
   Baker also spoke to an assemblage of some 50 human rights
activists at the U.S. Embassy and told them ``we are going to keep
up the pressure to resolve individual cases. We are going to push
to see that changes are institutionalized and human rights
guaranteed.''
   Baker plans to meet again with Shevardnadze on Thursday morning
before a two-hour session with Gorbachev. Baker will fly to
Brussels Thursday night to brief the members of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization.

   Syrian gunners blasted the presidential
palace, army headquarters and the U.S. ambassador's residence with
mortar fire Wednesday.
   Gunmen stormed the central prison in Moslem west Beirut, freeing
189 convicts. A special squad of police, armed with M-16 assault
rifles, recaptured 95 of them despite shellfire across the divided
city, authorities said.
   Police said 10 people were killed and 89 wounded in Wednesday's
duels between the Christian army units of Gen. Michel Aoun and
their Syrian and Druse militia foes.
   That raised the overall toll to 337 people killed and 1,323
wounded since the latest round of fighting, believed to be the most
destructive of Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war, erupted March 8.
   One salvo crashed into the building of the state-run Channel-7
television station in west Beirut during the 8:30 p.m. newscast.
The announcer ducked, then ran, and the station went off the air.
   Witnesses said 80 Syrian rockets struck the bay of the Christian
port city of Jounieh north of Beirut within five minutes, setting
off loud blasts and fires that burned in the night sky.
   Within an hour, 60 rounds, mostly 240mm mortars, struck the
presidential palace in the Christian suburb of Baabda and the
nearby Defense Ministry in Yarze, where Aoun has his headquarters.
   Only the Syrian army possesses such weapons in Lebanon.
   ``They've decided to demolish both facilities,'' a military
spokesman said by telephone from underground shelters at the
Defense Ministry.
   ``Our gunners are responding to silence the source of fire,'' he
said, insisting on anonymity.
   Aides said Aoun, 53, his wife and three daughters have been
living in a shelter at the palace.
   ``Damage was considerable, but we cannot really give a more
precise assessment because we have all been living in the bunker
for four days,'' said an official at the presidential palace.
   The U.S. Embassy said Ambassador John McCarthy's two-story villa
was hit, but there were no casualties. McCarthy and his family are
abroad.
   The one-sentence statement gave no other details.
   Tank clashes escalated into a savage shelling of Christian and
Moslem residential districts at about midnight, the police
spokesman said.
   ``Both sides were using the population as their shield,'' the
spokesman said. He cannot be named under standing police rules.
   Ambulance sirens and thuds from exploding shells echoed across
the city until the fighting slackened three hours later, he said.
   Early Wednesday, about 30 gunmen, armed with grenade launchers
and AK-47 automatic rifles, broke into the jail, the spokesman said.
   He said a Moslem police sergeant was killed in a shootout with
the gunmen, who ``entered the prison warden's office, took the
keys, opened the cells and turned loose all 189 prisoners.''
   The special police squad set up checkpoints at the southern
entrances to Beirut and searched cars for the wanted prisoners.
   In Damascus, Syria, an Arab League mediator met with Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa in an effort to revive an Arab
League-mediated cease-fire declared on April 28.
   Lakhdar Ibrahimi, an Algerian, was accompanied by Gen. Ali
Momen, a Kuwaiti officer chosen to head a 321-man observer force
drawn from six Arab nations to help implement a lasting cease-fire.
   Ibrahimi and Momen later traveled to the Syrian-controlled Bekaa
valley and met with Parliament Speaker Hussein Hussini, a Shiite
Moslem.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah Ahmed Sabah, said the
military observers would not arrive until a cease-fire takes hold.
   Aoun, who also heads a Christian military cabinet, and acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni who heads a rival Moslem
cabinet, both said they accepted the truce.
   But Syrian forces and Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militia
kept shelling Christian areas, claiming they were trying to prevent
three ships loaded with Iraqi weapons from supplying Aoun's forces.
   Iraq, which has a long-running feud with Syria, backs Aoun's
pledge to fight until the estimated 40,000 Syrian soldiers, in
Lebanon under a 13-year-old Arab League peacekeeping mandate, are
withdrawn.
   The latest fighting began two days after Aoun ordered a blockade
of ports controlled by Syrian-backed militias in a bid to recoup
lost tax revenues estimated at $100 million annually.
   Jumblatt's militia retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile
Christian-held region, and the Syrians joined in later.

   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir has been
hospitalized for tests after complaining of tiredness and weakness,
but hopes to be released by Friday, his spokesman said.
   Shamir, 73, was taken to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem after he
became faint Wednesday while attending Israel's annual Independence
Day Bible contest, spokesman Avi Pazner said.
   The prime minister had attended more than half a dozen events
since Monday night to mark two successive holidays, Memorial Day
and Independence Day.
   Pazner said Shamir fell against a piece of furniture in his home
Tuesday, bruising his cheek, but the injury was not serious and had
no connection with his hospitalization.
   Hospital spokeswoman Ruth Mekel said he was admitted ``for
general tests'' by Dr. Yehezkiel Stein, the hospital's director of
internal medicine. She said he was ``resting and is feeling fine.''
   His spokesman said Shamir ``hopes that in a day or two he will
be let out.'' Pazner said his boss was ``in an excellent mood ...
working on his schedule from his hospital room'' and had asked that
a radio and telephone be installed.
   Shamir's wife Shulamit visited him and more visitors were
expected, Pazner reported. He said the prime minister's general
health was ``excellent'' and he has no history of major medical
problems.

   Thousands of college students who have trudged
miles to protest for democracy got on their bicycles Wednesday and
pedaled to the offices of state-run media to call for press freedom.
   ``The People's Daily cheats the people! The Beijing Daily talks
nonsense!'' students chanted in their first march-on-wheels in
nearly a month of campaigning for political reforms. Many of the
5,000 students wore colorful paper sashes and headbands supporting
their cause.
   Students in the provincial capital of Taiyuan joined in the
democracy movement for the first time Wednesday when thousands held
sit-ins in front of a hotel and Shanxi provincial government
offices.
   The official Xinhua News Agency described the Taiyuan
demonstration as ``massive'' but gave no exact figure for
participants. A reporter at the Shanxi Daily, contacted by
telephone, said 4,000 to 5,000 students took part and demanded a
dialogue on corruption with the governor.
   The reporter said the protest was peaceful. It was not clear if
the governor responded.
   Thousands of students in more than a dozen other cities also
have held sporadic protests for political reform since Beijing
students began the movement April 15.
   But Beijing students have protested in the greatest numbers to
press their demands for a dialogue with national leaders to reform
China's tightly controlled political system.
   On Wednesday, the Ministry of Supervision said it will allow
more open news reporting of corruption cases. It said the move was
``prompted by the recent demands of Beijing University students to
crack down on corruption'' _ the first acknowlegement that the
government was giving ground to students and workers.
   The bicycle protest was much smaller than other recent protests
in the capital, but participants said they were keeping up pressure
on the government. At least 16 schools took part.
   Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who has made
several conciliatory statements on the student movement, on
Wednesday stressed the need for political reform but mentioned no
specific changes.
   Zhao was a key sponsor of political reform plans in 1987 that
called for increasing popular access to officials and reducing
direct party involvement in day-to-day government operations. But
political reforms have been put on hold in the past year as leaders
have emphasized re-establishing controls over a chaotic economy.
   ``Many difficulties that have cropped up in the course of the
reform of the economic setup cannot possibly be overcome without a
reform of the political setup,'' Xinhua quoted Zhao as telling a
visiting Bulgarian delegation.
   The student protesters have put forward no comprehensive
political program, but say they want the rights listed in the
Chinese constitution _ freedom of speech, assembly and publication.
   Strict party censorship of the media has been a target of their
protests.
   The student bicyclists painted slogans on their T-shirts,
jackets, hats and headbands calling for a free press and accurate
reporting on their own protests. They also expressed support for
more than 1,000 journalists who signed a petition given to the
government Tuesday calling for a dialogue on censorship.
   The bicyclists stopped traffic for miles as they swarmed from
campuses in northern Beijing to hold protests at the national TV
network, Xinhua and the People's Daily, the party newspaper. No
officials came out to speak with them.
   ``People's reporters, speak for the people,'' the students
chanted outside the People's Daily, where they were cheered by
about 2,000 residents. One man brought out two cases of beer for
the thirsty protesters.
   About 50 leading writers cycled along with the students, the
first time they have done so. About 300 journalists joined a
student march last week.
   ``They should not be allowed to stand alone,'' said writer Su
Xiaokang.
   Police did not attempt to interfere, and tried along several
stretches of the route to clear the way for the bicyclists.
   Many students said they planned more protests next week when
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev arrives for the first
Chinese-Soviet summit in 30 years.
   ``I am willing to keep marching,'' said one student. ``I'm a bit
tired but these things cannot be achieved in just one swoop.''

   Opposition presidential candidate
Guillermo Endara was injured today when police broke up an
opposition demonstration with gunfire and tear gas, an aide said.
   Endara was taken to a hospital, his head bleeding and his shirt
covered with blood, the opposition coalition said in a statement.
   ``The wound apparently is not serious. They're giving him first
aid,'' Maria de Montenegro, a secretary at Endara's office, said in
a telephone interview.
   Endara and his vice presidential candidates were leading a
motorcade when riot police began using tear gas and birdshot to
disperse demonstrators who took to the streets to cheer the
opposition and condemn the election as rigged.
   Earlier today, an opposition leader predicted that violence will
occur if the hand-picked candidate of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
is declared the winner of Sunday's presidential election.
   Supporters of the opposition canceled a plan to present an
official protest claiming fraud, saying they wanted to prepare for
today's march.
   Opposition leaders and the United States, which has long tried
to drive Noriega from power, have condemned the vote as fraudulent.
   Since the election, the presidents of Guatemala, Costa Rica,
Peru and Venezuela have contacted Endara, and he urged them to ask
the Panamanian government not to proclaim Noriega's candidate the
victor, sources in the opposition said today.
   Guillermo Cochez, vice president of the opposition Christian
Democrat Party, told reporters today that a government proclamation
of victory would incite violence ``because the people know who
won.''
   Troops fired into the air to disperse an opposition march
Monday, and at least three people were wounded.
   According to official results from the national tabulation
center, Carlos Duque, Noriega's choice for president, was leading
Endara 2-to-1. With about 15 percent of Sunday's vote counted, the
results showed Duque with 105,522 votes and Endara with 51,844.
   But results supplied by opposition pollwatchers gave Endara the
lead 236,097 to 79,260 with 35.8 percent of the vote counted. That
was close to the 3-to-1 edge indicated by a Roman Catholic Church
exit poll.
   Nevertheless, telephone operators at COLINA, the pro-government
coaltion, answered telephones Tuesday with ``Duque is President, up
with Duque.''
   Panama swept up from the boisterous, acrid but colorful campaign
that saw virtually every tree and wall pasted with posters.
   Police still patrolled the streets, but shopkeepers began to
open boarded up establishments and streetsweepers began hauling
away campaign debris by the truckload.
   President Bush and the presidents of Peru, Costa Rica and
Venezuela condemned election fraud, and the foreign ministers of
the Group of Eight, whic promotes regional stability, were planning
a special meeting to discuss ousting Panama from the organization.
   Panama has been suspended since early last year from the group,
which backs democratic processes and tries to mediate peaceful
solutions to regional disputes.
   Other members are Argentina, Venezuela, Peru, Mexico, Colombia,
Brazil and Uruguay.
   A spokesman for Venezuela's foreign ministry said Panama could
be kicked out of the Group of Eight if election fraud was proved.
   The opposition has said it will continue peaceful efforts to get
rid of Noriega, Panama's de facto leader since 1983 and head of its
15,000-member Defense Forces. Noriega has not made a public
appearance or statement since election day.
   Endara said Tuesday he opposes ousting Noriega through U.S.
military intervention _ an option cited by the White House as under
discussion. Endara said intervention would cause more problems than
it could solve.
   He and other opposition leaders did not specify what action they
wanted from Washington, which has been trying to topple Noriega
since his indictment last year in Miami on drug-trafficking charges.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, who was in Panama as part of an
independent delegation monitoring the elections, returned to
Washington, where he briefed Bush on Tuesday and denounced the
elections as fraudulent.
   He told Bush that military force and any break in the terms of
the 1977 Torrijos-Carter treaties would play into Noriega's hands.
   Noriega has tried to unite Panamanians by contending that the
United States plans to invade Panama and renege on the treaties,
which cede control of the canal to Panama at the end of the century.
   In Washington, Bush called on foreign leaders to urge Noriega to
honor the election results.
   A Bush spokesman said the U.S. president was considering
sanctions ranging from increased economic measures to military
action. American economic sanctions have damaged Panama's economy
but have failed to force Noriega out.
   Most journalists' visas expired today and some, including two
correspondents from the Voice of America, were told they would be
denied extensions, forcing them to leave Panama.
   VOA correspondent Mike Drudge said he was told the government
considers VOA, a U.S. government agency, to be ``an agency of
misinformation.''
   Oswaldo Velasquez, the head of Panama's human rights commission,
said most of the more than 350 foreign observers it invited had
left Tuesday and that others were collecting more reports of troops
confiscating voting tallies.
   Also today, Holland asked the Panamanian government for an
explanation in the death of a Dutch priest who was shot Sunday
while under arrest in the western province of Chiriqui.

   Charges were dismissed Wednesday against
a popular university basketball player who last month was accused
of raping a woman on campus.
   The Suffolk County district attorney's office said it had
determined that Quincy Brandon Troupe, 22, who is black, had not
attacked the 20-year-old white woman.
   His arrest had triggered demonstrations on campus at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook in which protesters alleged
the arrest was racially motivated.
   The victim had picked Troupe out of two police line-ups and
identified him from a yearbook picture.
   Troupe, a Harlem resident who had been free in $10,000 bail,
maintained that he was with friends in Manhattan at the time of the
March 24 attack.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Ahearn told Suffolk County
District Court Judge Edward Green that a ``long and exhaustive
investigation'' showed the evidence against Troupe was weak and
insufficient.
   He said there was no physical evidence against Troupe, his alibi
witnesses were strong and the victim decided not to appear before a
grand jury.
   Troupe smiled broadly and hugged his parents, Margaret and
Quincy Troupe Sr., and his lawyer, C. Vernon Mason, when the judge
dropped the case.
   John Williams, spokesman for the district attorney's office,
said outside the courtroom that the decision to drop charges did
not mean the victim was lying. ``This means that we do not believe
that he (Troupe) did it,'' said Williams.
   ``I knew I wasn't guilty,'' Troupe told reporters. ``I felt it
was just a matter of time.''
   Of the victim, Troupe said, ``I hope in her case that justice
will be done, because if the rape occurred, then there's still a
guy running around out there.''
   Troupe, a popular senior engineering student and starting guard
on the basketball team, was initially suspended by the school after
his arrest April 1. A week later he was granted unrestricted access
to the campus.

   The government brought in a special plane
Wednesday to determine how much airspace a new six-story hotel is
obscuring from controllers' radar.
   Federal Aviation Administration officials insisted flights in
and out of Portland International Jetport are safe. But they
considered the gaps in the radar coverage serious enough to send in
an airplane full of computer gear, two pilots and a technician less
than 24 hours after air traffic controllers complained about the
problem.
   ``We considered it urgent,'' FAA spokesman Michael Ciccarelli
said.
   He said it would be at least a few days before any information
on the problem could be analyzed, he said.
   Air traffic controllers said a wedge of airspace 6,000 feet high
and perhaps eight miles wide at its broadest point has been blocked
from radar by the construction of a Quality Suites hotel.
   The FAA said that when Portland-based Dunfey Properties Inc.
proposed the hotel, no objections arose because a typographical
error in the developer's documents indicated the building would be
about 12,000 feet from the runway instead of about 1,200 feet away.
   ``But we're not pointing the finger at anyone,'' Ciccarelli
said. ``Why point the finger at an innocent mistake.''
   Dunfey President Bob Dunfey Jr. on Wednesday acknowledged the
typo. But he said the company's documentation included a U.S.
Geological Survey map that showed the correct location. Dunfey
suggested FAA officials should have caught the error.
   ``A quarter of a mile and 2{ miles is a big difference,'' Dunfey
said.
   Dunfey and the local president of the National Air Traffic
Controllers Association, Cheryl Readio, said moving the radar or
altering its setting might solve the problem.
   Jim Lucas, manager of the FAA's Air Traffic Division for New
England, said that if Wednesday's testing found a serious enough
problem, some flight corridors could be temporarily changed.
   Ms. Readio said no flights had run into trouble, but the air
traffic controllers wanted the situation changed before a problem
did develop.
   Controllers said the gap could cause some planes southwest of
the city to disappear from the radar screen, including flights from
Boston to Portland, flights in and out of smaller airports in
Biddeford and Sanford and some military flights from Pease Air
Force Base in Newington, N.H.
   President Bush flies in that area of southern Maine on the
Marine One helicopter when he travels from Pease to his summer home
in Kennebunkport, but Lucas said the president's flights could not
be affected because they are controlled through Pease.

   The Midgetman intercontinental ballistic
missile, subject of debates on Capitol Hill and within the Bush
administration, will be flight tested for the first time Thursday,
the Pentagon announced Wednesday.
   The initial test of the missile, designed to be fired from a
truck launcher, will be at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California,
the Pentagon and Air Force said in a statement.
   The first test will not be made from a mobile launcher, but
rather from a standard concrete launch pad, the Air Force added.
The launch time has been set at 2 p.m. EDT, but is subject to
change, the service said.
   If all goes according to plan, the launch will send the missile
more than 5,000 miles to the Pacific Test Range in the Kwajalein
Islands.
   The Midgetman, known formally as the Small Intercontinental
Ballistic Missile, is designed to carry a single nuclear warhead to
a target as far away as 6,900 statute miles.
   The three-stage missile weighs 37,000 pounds, stands roughly 52
feet tall and is 46 inches in diameter.
   The political controversy involves the issue of whether the
United States should develop one or two mobile missiles for its
nuclear arsenal. The Soviet Union already has developed and begun
deploying two such ``land-mobile'' missiles, while the United
States has none.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney would prefer to develop only one
mobile missile _ a version of the huge, 10-warhead MX that could be
carried and launched from a rail car.
   President Bush recently decided, however, to pursue development
of both the MX and Midgetman to appease Congress.
   Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill argue that the nation needs a
mobile missile to deter the Soviet Union from attempting a first
strike against missiles deployed inside silos and that the smaller,
more mobile Midgetman is the best alternative.
   Cheney, while accepting the president's decision, has countered
by saying the Pentagon will be hard pressed to afford the
Midgetman's cost _ roughly $25 billion if 500 are built.
   The issue remains controversial, despite Bush's decision,
because some Democrats want to speed up the pace of development for
the Midgetman at the expense of the rail-mobile MX.
   The major contractors on the Midgetman include Morton Thiokol
Inc. of Brigham City, Utah, which is building the first-stage
rocket motor; the Aerojet Nevada Rocket Operations of Sacramento,
Calif., which is developing the second-stage motor, and the
Aerospace Production Group of Magna, Utah, which is building the
third-stage motor.
   The Martin Marietta Corp. has been hired by the Air Force to
oversee assembly and testing and to provide support services. The
truck launcher for the missile is being developed separately by the
Boeing Aerospace Co. in Seattle, Wash.

<HEAD>Solar Activity Said to Contribute to Ozone Damage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The barrage of charged particles from the sun
may be contributing to the damage to the Earth's protective ozone
layer, a pair of government scientists reported Wednesday.
   ``Very dramatic changes have occurred' in the number of
electrons raining down on the Earth between 1979 and 1984, Linwood
Callis of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said at
a meeting of the American Geophysical Union.
   This flow of electrons, enhanced by the solar wind _ an energy
flow from the sun _ leads to the formation of oxides of nitrogen in
the upper parts of the stratosphere.
   In turn, those nitrogen compounds can settle into the
stratosphere where ``if you have any kind of significant build-up,
then what you have is the possibility of catalytic destruction of
ozone,'' said Callis.
   Ozone helps protect the Earth from potentially damaging
ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
   ``What the model calculations show and that the data confirm is
that from 1979 to 1985 the (nitrogen oxide) levels in the polar
lower stratosphere probably increased betweeen 30 and 80 or 90
percent. In the equatorial region there have been increases, much
smaller, on the order of 10 or 15 percent,'' Callis said.
   Damage to the ozone over the South Pole has been widely
discussed in recent years. Callis said that so-called Antarctic
``ozone hole'' appears to be largely a result of chlorine compounds
trapped over the polar areas, since ice particles in this region
tend to remove many nitrogen compounds from the air.
   ``The interest that we have in this is primarily related to
global ozone ... there are larger than expected ozone changes,''
said Callis.
   Scientists have warned that if that ozone damage were to spread
to other parts of the Earth, the increased radiation could cause an
increase in skin cancer. International efforts are being made to
reduce or ban the use of ozone-damaging chemicals.
   Callis and Dan Baker, also of NASA, reported that they have used
satellite data to study levels of ozone, nitrogen oxides and other
chemicals around the world.
   In the air about 16 miles above the surface, the area where
ozone is most concentrated, they found the gas depleted by as much
as 14 percent between 1979 and 1985, Callis said.
   This could be occurring because of some natural changes in
atmospheric chemistry, he said. But having it occur at the same
time the flood of charged particles from the sun is increasing
makes them consider the possibility of cause and effect.
   Natural changes in the solar cycle should reduce the amount of
incoming charged particles between now and the mid-1990s, said
Callis, and he and Baker are interested in seeing if ozone levels
will recover during that period.
   The flow of particles is lowest during periods of sunspot
maximums and increased when there were fewer sunspots.
   ``There are ... clear links between the state of the
magnetosphere and the state of the middle atmosphere,'' Callis said.

<HEAD>Vice President Says Senate Should Stay Out Of Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle said Wednesday a
Senate committee is considering legislation he called
``unfortunate'' because it would undermine U.S. efforts aimed at a
negotiated political peace in Cambodia.
   ``It surprised me to learn that the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee is considering a measure that would abruptly change U.S.
policy toward Cambodia and essentially eliminate whatever leverage
we may be able to exercise over the situation there,'' Quayle told
the Philadelphia World Affairs Council during a luncheon.
   Quayle returned last week from a tour of Southeast Asia. At a
Cambodian refugee camp near the Thai-Cambodian border, he noted
that the refugees would like to return home but must await the
withdrawal of Vietnamese forces.
   The refugees also must consider the political climate in their
homeland after troop withdrawals before they could go home, he said.
   ``Considerable progress has been (made) in ongoing negotiations
among the Cambodian factions toward agreement on an interim
coalition government under Prince Sihanouk,'' he said. Part of that
agreement is a provision for free elections later.
   With negotiations now in a ``delicate state,'' he said, the Bush
administration is staying away from any binding policy decisions
``with respect to possible additional aid to the non-Communist
resistance'' as well as some form of concession to the Communist
factions who might help in achieving a peaceful settlement.
   The group of prime concern is the Communist Khmer Rouge, once
the most powerful faction and believed responsible for the deaths
of 20 percent of Cambodia's 1975 population during its bloody rule.
   Quayle said the Senate committee is considering legislation that
would ``prevent the U.S. from supporting any Cambodian settlement
in which any elements of the Khmer Rouge would play a role of any
kind,'' even a peace-making or maintaining role.
   Quayle said the effect of the committee proposal would be to
reward the Vietnamese by leaving their puppet regime in place.
   During a question and answer period, the vice president was
asked about U.S. reaction to the recent Panamanian elections in
which Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega declared victory for his
candidate despite claims of election fraud.
   President George Bush ``has all the options,'' Quayle said.
``I'm not going into that.''
   Before his speech, Quayle explored the Mediterranean Sea by
means of a live satellite arrangement set up by Dr. Robert D.
Ballard, who found the Titanic in the north Atlantic using a
remote-controlled robot-camera known as Jason.
   Jason, television and satellites are providing live coverage of
Ballard's work to audiences of children at nine museums around the
country, including Philadelphia's Franklin Institute.
   Quayle also was in Philadelphia to place a wreathe at the Tomb
of the Unknown Revolutionary War Hero near Independence Hall.

<TEXT>
   The leader of Italy's Communists will visit the
United States next week for the first time, presenting his party as
liberal in American terms and even as willing to consider dropping
``Communist'' from its name.
   Party Secretary Achille Occhetto, who leads the largest
Communist party in the West and the No. 2 party in Italy, said,
``It is very important in the United States that one understands
that our party represents something profoundly original.''
   He said his party has fought domestic battles for civil rights
and democratic causes and has criticized Soviet foreign policy.
   Still, his party, which claims 1.5 million members, has been
locked out of Christian Democrat-dominated governments since 1947.
   Successive U.S. administrations have viewed the party with
suspicion, favoring a reduction in Communist influence in Western
Europe.
   ``I can say that the government of the United States doesn't
share the values that the Communists set forth, and on this point
our position hasn't changed,'' U.S. Ambassador Maxwell Rabb said in
an interview published this week by Epoca magazine.
   However, he added, ``Yes, I think it will be good that Occhetto
listens to the American point of view, and in this sense he will
find the United States a warm and friendly country,'' Rabb said.
   He spoke in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday in
Communist Party headquarters shortly after the government easily
survived a confidence vote brought by the Communists. They were
protesting a new health plan that imposes nominal fees for
hospitalization and medical tests.
   Occhetto, 53, took over the party last July with the mandate to
reverse its sagging electoral fortunes. A decade after winning
about a third of the vote and coming to the brink of power, the
Communists have been jolted by a series of electoral drubbings.
   The new party secretary has been trying to give the party a
youthful image, allowing himself to be photographed while sailing
or while kissing his wife. The party has been jumping on ecological
issues and debating a name change as part of a wider initiative to
forge links with Western European Socialist parties.
   The party's daily newspaper even carries the Milan stock market
listings in a bid to attract the upwardly mobile, who have been
giving their votes to former Premier Bettino Craxi's Socialists.
   ``If I can translate it into American (terms), our party is a
liberal party,'' said Occhetto.
   He acknowledged that in the United States, the word
``communist'' is often synonomous with Eastern Europe. He said he
intends to project an image of a party ``that uses democratic
methods to reform society.''
   Occhetto also said his party supports Italy's membership in the
Western NATO alliance.
   He leaves for New York on Monday with Giorgio Napolitano, a
party foreign policy specialist, who will interpret for him.
   They have no meetings lined up with Bush administration
officials. However, Occhetto is scheduled to talk with leaders of
the House and Senate, meet with the editorial boards of The New
York Times and The Washington Post, and give speeches in Washington
and New York, according to his aides.

<TEXT>
   A controversy over the loss of a U.S. hydrogen bomb
off Japan 24 years ago has added to the tension surrounding the
U.S. military presence here and created anxiety among Japanese.
   Japan, the only nation ever attacked with nuclear weapons, is
especially sensitive about any kind of danger from nuclear arms.
   The U.S. military said Monday that an A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying
the bomb fell off the U.S. aircraft carrier Ticonderoga in 1965
about 80 miles from a small island in southern Okinawa.
   The statement followed the release of a report by the Greenpeace
environmental group that detailed the loss.
   ``The U.S. government said the bomb does not threaten the
environment,'' Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno said in response to
opposition party questions in Parliament on Wednesday.
   Uno said Tokyo would decide whether to take action on the
matter, which has triggered angry citizen protests, after it hears
from Washington. On Monday, the government asked for a U.S.
explanation of the incident.
   The controversy has added an irritant to U.S. military relations
with Okinawa, site of one of the bloodiest battles in World War II.
The presence of about 35,000 U.S. troops there has led to friction
over a range of issues, from soldiers' behavior to target range
accidents.
   The Japan Congress Against Atomic and Hydrogen Weapons blasted
U.S. secrecy about the bomb loss in a statement Tuesday.
   The governor of Okinawa, Junji Nishime, said he will urge the
government to take steps to calm anxiety among residents of the
island prefecture. The Okinawa assembly is to open an extraordinary
session to look into the bomb loss.
   Another anti-nuclear group in Kagoshima, in southwestern Japan,
sent telegrams to Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and President
Bush, asking them to abide by Japan's ban on nuclear weapons or
abolish the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty.
   Under the treaty, about 60,000 U.S. troops are posted in Japan.
   Citizen protests of accidents, aircraft noise and the presumed
presence of nuclear weapons aboard U.S. ships visiting Japan are
common.
   Japan maintains that the security treaty requires prior
consultation by the United States if it wants to introduce nuclear
weapons into Japanese territory. It says there never have been any
such consultations.
   U.S. policy is to neither confirm nor deny the presence of
nuclear weapons in specific locations.
   Japanese citizens and opposition politicians have accused
Washington of covering up the 1965 incident, but the Defense
Department denied the allegations.
   ``It was way out to sea in international waters,'' said Defense
Department spokesman Dan Howard. ``The weapon went down in 16,000
feet of water. There was no danger to anyone. ... There was not
then and there is not now.''
   ``We have faithfully honored our obligations under the
U.S.-Japanese Treaty of Mutual Security and its related
arrangements, and we'll continue to do so,'' he said.

   The Pentagon notified Congress Wednesday tht
it had approved a series of arms deals with three Middle Eastern
countries and Taiwan.
   Assuming there are no congressional objections, the Pentagon
said it intended to sell Hawk surface-to-air missiles to Egypt;
maintenance and training services for F-5 and F-15 jet fighters to
Saudi Arabia, and rocket artillery launchers to Bahrain.
   Taiwan is being offered 88 Standard ship-defense missiles for
$44 million, the Pentagon added.
   By far the largest of the transactions are the deals with Saudi
Arabia. The two maintenance and service contracts for the fighters,
including their Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles, will total about
$500 million, the Pentagon said.
   The deal with Egypt is valued at $51 million and will include
150 Hawk missiles. The deal with Bahrain covers seven so-called
Multiple Launch Rocket Systems and will total about $93 million.
   The Mideast transactions ``will not affect the basic military
balance in the region,'' the Pentagon informed Congress.

<DATELINE>OAK PARK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only a few times since young George
Washington took a hatchet to a sapling has cutting into trees
caused such a ruckus.
   After court fights, charges of lying and deception, and a work
stoppage, a judge has told officials of Oak Park and the DuPage
County Water Commission that if they can't agree on how to finish
carving out the path for a new water main, ``I will deal with this
on a tree-by-tree basis.''
   And so Tuesday, as Cook County Judge Kenneth Gillis ordered,
officials from both sides set off on a walking tour in the brisk
spring air. Their mission was to determine exactly how much more
tree trimming is necessary to make room for the pipe-laying crane.
   Long-time residents of the historic west Chicago suburb, which
won national recognition as a ``Tree City'' just last year, say too
much trimming already has been done.
   ``It already looks like a war zone,'' said Tina Birnbaum, an Oak
Park resident for 10 years. ``You can define anything as `pruning,'
I guess, but when you take off everything but the trunk, I'd call
it destruction.''
   At the center of the controversy is DuPage County's attempt to
pump in water from Lake Michigan and replace a system of wells
inadequate to serve a booming housing and business corridor.
   ``I used to live in Elmhurst (a DuPage County community) and I
can appreciate how bad well water is,'' said Mrs. Birnbaum. ``But
one of the reasons I moved here was because I got tired of looking
at tiny trees in all those new subdivisions.
   ``Worse yet, I walk my son to school each day and ... the work
crews don't have the good sense to stop the machinery and the
driving back and forth.
   ``They came to school one day and told the kids to be careful,''
she said. ``But these are little children we're talking about, not
high schoolers.''
   The eastern edge of DuPage County is only about 20 miles west of
Lake Michigan, but about 160 miles of pipe will be laid _ most of
it channeling the water to different communities within county
boundaries.
   In Oak Park, residential streets along a two-mile stretch have
been torn up at an average of one block each week while work crews
dig trenches about 20 feet deep.
   Branches of trees that hang over the street _ most of them elms,
oaks and maples, many 70 years old _ are pruned to make room for
the 90-foot crane that lifts the pipe sections _ 20 feet long and 9
feet wide _ and drop them into the trench.
   Donald Mulack, an attorney for Oak Park, told the court Monday
that 47 of 356 trees designated for ``pruning,'' have been
``amputated'' and nine others were destroyed.
   Clifford Weaver, attorney for the water commission, said only
three trees have been destroyed and plans call for destruction of
just one more to finish the route.
   Gillis sided with the village on the extent of damage to the
trees.
   But rather than granting either side's request for an
injunction, the judge ordered representatives from both sides to
walk the route, negotiating ``by inches and branches'' and agreeing
on ``every cut'' before moving on to the next tree.

   The House on Wednesday impeached U.S. District
Judge Walter L. Nixon of Mississippi, who is serving a five-year
perjury sentence, and sent the case to the Senate for trial to
decide whether he should be ousted from office. The vote was 417-0.
   ``Let's get on with this task, unpleasant as it may be, before
he returns to the bench,'' Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., told
the House as it acted on the third judicial impeachment case in
recent years.
   The three impeachment articles were sent to the Senate for a
trial to determine whether Nixon will be removed from office and
deprived of the $89,500 annual salary he has been collecting while
serving his sentence at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida.
   The Senate currently is holding an impeachment trial for U.S.
District Judge Alcee L. Hastings of Florida. He was acquitted in
1983 on charges of conspiracy to receive a $150,000 bribe but
lawmakers are seeking his removal anyway, saying there is ample
evidence.
   U.S. District Judge Harry Claiborne of Nevada was impeached by
the House in 1986 while serving a tax evasion sentence and later
removed from the bench by the Senate.
   Nixon was convicted of perjury after denying in 1984 before both
a federal grand jury and Justice Department investigators that he
intervened in a narcotics case involving the son of Hattiesburg
business executive Wiley Fairchild.
   Nixon was acquitted of accepting an illegal gratuity in that
case.
   But evidence at his trial and developed in an impeachment
investigation by the House was that Nixon discussed the marijuana
case with then-Forrest County District Attorney Paul Holmes.
   Fairchild later pleaded guilty to a charge of providing Nixon
with an improper gratuity in 1981, specifically an oil and gas
investment. Nixon paid with $9,500 in promissory notes and
collected royalties totaling $60,000.
   ``There's no doubt that Wylie gave Judge Nixon a sweet deal,''
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., told the House.
   The written agreement between the two was backdated one year to
a time before Fairchild's son, Hattiesburg Airport manager Drew
Fairchild, was indicted on charges of helping to smuggle a ton of
marijuana through the airport.
   Nixon's attorneys have argued that many of the answers that he
gave to the grand jury were technically correct and that others did
not constitute an impeachable offense.
   Nixon has collected more than $286,000 in salary since his
conviction and has been saying that he plans to return to the bench
and preside over cases when he is released. Lawmakers said his
release could come within a matter of months.
   The articles of impeachment said that Nixon ``has raised
substantial doubt as to his judicial integrity, undermined
confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary,
betrayed the trust of the people of the United States and brought
disrepute on the federal courts and the administration of justice.''

<HEAD>New York City Schools Chancellor Dead at 52</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Inserts one graf after the 3rd to update with autopsy results.</HEAD>

   Richard R. Green, who became New York City's
first black schools chancellor when he was recruited from
Minneapolis 14 months ago, died unexpectedly Wednesday after a
severe asthma attack. He was 52.
   The death stunned city leaders and educators who had pinned
their hopes for reform of the nation's largest school system on
Green, a no-nonsense administrator with a dogged sense of his
mission.
   Green, who had a history of asthma and took medicine to control
it, arrived at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center at 2:30 a.m.
suffering from acute respiratory arrest, the attending physician,
Kenneth Goetz, said. He died 40 minutes later.
   An autopsy determined the cause of death was acute and chronic
bronchial asthma, said Ellen Borakove of the city medical
examiner's office.
   ``We have suffered ... a great loss,'' said Mayor Edward I.
Koch, who rushed to the hospital when he learned of Green's attack.
``He was starting to turn the system around. He loved the
children.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, calling Green ``an outstanding educator with
immense potential,'' proposed the city name a school for Green to
honor his efforts to rebuild crumbling school buildings.
   Disintegrating buildings were just one of the problems faced by
Green upon his arrival in New York in March 1988. His was a stormy
tenure, marked by the arrest of a principal for buying crack,
repeated episodes of gun-toting in schools and corruption
allegations against local school boards.
   ``He embarked upon a Herculean task. ... He took over the
leadership of our school system at a time when many were gloomy,
even cynical about its prospects,'' said Manhattan Borough
President David Dinkins.
   Green had made a start. He cut the central School Board
bureaucracy by one-fifth, won friends and allies among teachers and
was applauded for his personal touch when dealing with students.
   ``Richard Green related to teachers as a colleague and to
students as a teacher,'' said Sandra Feldman, president of the
United Federation of Teachers.
   At an emergency meeting Wednesday afternoon, the Board of
Education approved Deputy Chancellor Bernard Mecklowitz as acting
chancellor. Wagner said the search committee that chose Green will
be asked to find his permanent successor.
   The Arkansas-born Green was a product of the Minneapolis school
system and rose through its ranks as a teacher, principal and
assistant superintendent before becoming its first black
superintendent in July 1980.
   While he received credit for turning the system around, two of
his policies stirred controversy: using test ``gates'' for
promotion from kindergarten and school centralization to help
promote desegregation.
   During his eight years in Minneapolis, he was mentioned as a
candidate to run the school systems in Houston, San Francisco and
Seattle. New York tapped him after months of infighting by
politicians, union heads and other leaders.
   While Green was hailed as the best of three finalists when he
received the job, race was an issue in his selection. With blacks
making up 38 percent of the city's 939,000 students, there was
pressure for a black candidate to receive the job.
   Green is survived by his wife, Gwen, and four children. A
memorial service is scheduled Friday. Flags at city schools will
fly at half-staff for 30 days, said Board of Education spokesman
Robert Terte.

<HEAD>Strike Leaders Agree to Management Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strike leaders at four southwestern copper
mines on Wednesday accepted a management proposal to increase wages
by 30 percent and end a six-day walkout, a spokesman said.
   The workers had been demanding a 50 percent increase in their
pay, which now averages $118 to $176 a month. The strike they began
last week reportedly has cost millions of dollars in lost
production.
   Jan Sugalski of the strike committee said the proposal presented
Wednesday by management also provided for a 30 percent bonus if
production goals are met.
   The strike committee plans to present the proposal to the
workers for approval, Sugalski said. He said he expected crews to
be back on the job by Thursday.
   Solidarity's national spokesman, Janusz Onyszkiewicz, told a
news conference Wednesday the strike had been ``inspired'' by the
official trade union OPZZ but that Solidarity members were
supporting it.
   The strike represented the first significant labor unrest since
a broad-ranging accord between the Solidarity-led opposition and
the communist government was concluded April 5.
   The agreement restored legal status to Solidarity, the
independent trade union that was outlawed in 1982 after the
imposition of martial law in 1981.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, speaking Tuesday at a workers'
rally, stopped short of telling the copper miners to return to
their jobs but said there were more significant problems to solve
first.
   The four affected mines employ about 20,000 miners near the
southwestern city of Lubin and produce most of Poland's copper. The
official PAP news agency said the strike has cut production by
about 100,000 tons daily. The television news said losses amounted
to $2.8 million daily.
   About 15,000 miners have supported the strike, the strike
committee said.
   The committee includes 10 members of the independent Solidarity
trade union, seven from the party-dominated OPZZ union and 13
unaffiliated miners, Solidarity said.
   Poland is the world's eighth-largest copper exporter and ranks
fourth in Europe after the Soviet Union, Belgium, and West Germany.

   Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman is suing
makers of the film ``Hoosiers'' and a video distributor for $5.5
million he says is owed him.
   In the Superior Court lawsuit filed Tuesday, Hackman claimed he
is owed one-third of a $15 million advance royalty allegedly paid
by video distributor Home Box Office to Hemdale Film Corp. The suit
contends that HBO and Hemdale cheated Hackman by denying there was
such a payment.
   Paul MacKee, director of business affairs at Hemdale, said
Wednesday the film company hadn't seen the suit and there would be
no comment.
   ``We have not received any notice of that lawsuit. We have not
been served,'' said HBO lawyer Horace Collins, refusing to comment
further.
   Hackman's 1971 role as relentless cop Popeye Doyle in ``The
French Connection'' earned him an Academy Award. He was nominated
for the best actor Oscar again this year for his role as a savvy
FBI agent in ``Mississippi Burning.''
   ``Hoosiers'' stars Hackman as a down-on-his-luck basketball
coach who leads a rural Indiana high school team to the state
championship.

<HEAD>Jewish Congress Urges EEC To Bar Austria Unless Reparations Are Paid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The World Jewish Congress has received
assurances from several governments that Austria will not be
admitted to the European Economic Community unless it pays
reparations to Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust, a spokesman
said Wednesday.
   The assurances were given in response to a letter by the WJC to
the 12 nations of the EEC asking them to link Austria's expected
application with its commitment to compensate fully the Jews who
suffered persecution when the Nazis ruled Austria. Austria intends
to apply for membership in the trading body by the end of the year.
   WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg declined to say which
European governments had responded to the letter but said he was
encouraged by their reaction.
   In its letter to the 12 EEC ambassadors in Brussels, the WJC
said ``The Jewish communities of Europe are of the firm view ...
that prior to EEC membership, Austria must recognize its moral and
material responsibilities towards Jewish survivors.''
   The WJC, which provided copies of the letter, said a similar one
was sent last November to the chancellor of Austria, Franz
Vranitsky.
   Some 68,000 Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration camps in
World War II, and another 120,000 were incarcerated or fled the
country.
   Austria's parliament last year voted a one-time compensation of
between $200 and $400 for each victim.
   Jewish groups called the decision a sacrilege, saying it was
motivated by the international condemnation of the election of Kurt
Waldheim as president despite allegations of his involvement in
Nazi atrocities. Waldheim has been banned from entry into the
United States because of his past.
   West Germany agreed in 1952 to pay Holocaust victims lifetime
reparations, but Austria contends it was annexed by Nazi Germany
and is not as culpable even though many of its citizens cooperated
with the Germans.
   ``Austria seeks entry into the European Community based on a
desire for financial benefit,'' Steinberg said. ``It should not
receive such benefits unless it fulfills its financial obligations
arising from its participation in the persecution of Jews.''

<HEAD>Coast Guard Issues Findings On Exxon Cleanup Proposal</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Oil Spill Bjt</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard's on-site commander of the
Exxon Valdez oil spill told Exxon on Wednesday that its proposed
cleanup plan was basically sound but ordered changes, including
weekly progress reports.
   Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the on-site commander of the Alaska oil
spill cleanup, ordered Exxon to provide immediately a detailed
operations schedule for areas outside Prince William Sound, along
the fouled beaches southwest of Valdez that include the spectacular
Katmai National Park wildlife refuge.
   ``That should be submitted as soon as the shoreline committee
furnishes you an inventory of beaches requiring attention,''
Robbins said in a letter to Exxon general manager Otto Harrison,
the oil company's ranking executive in the spill zone.
   He said it appeared doubtful that Exxon could meet its Sept. 15
cleanup deadline. ``I am seriously concerned that the investment of
resources you describe will not be able to clean the 300-plus miles
of shoreline in the time alloted,'' he told Harrison.
   Exxon's proposed cleanup plan, submitted May 1, called for
cleanup of 364 miles of shore by Sept. 15 and said it would seek
exemptions from local environmental laws in order to dispose of the
recovered oily waste.
   ``I emphasize that the concept of the plan is sound,'' Robbins
said. ``Please address these concerns I've presented immediately
and incorporate them into your plan. Advise me as you do so.''
   In Washington, Exxon USA President W.D. Stevens told a Senate
committee that the company would deploy 1,600 more workers, plus
more barges and boats, bringing to 5,000 the total number of
cleanup workers involved in the shoreline cleanup.
   Robbins, in a separate issue, said authorities were considering
the possible use of chemical dispersants on beaches to break down
the oily sludge. ``That's going to be studied very carefully before
we try it,'' Robbins said.
   Environmentalists have attacked the use of dispersants,
contending the chemicals pose a health risk.
   Under federal law, the Coast Guard is responsible for
supervising the cleanup and must approve the company's strategy to
handle the more than 10 million gallons of crude oil dumped into
Prince William Sound when the tanker Exxon Valdez struck a reef 25
miles from Valdez on March 24.
   The oil has spread about 450 miles southwest of Valdez.
   Robbins told Exxon to:
   _Provide more personnel and equipment for the cleanup.
   _Let the Coast Guard know what special equipment is needed so
the government could help find it.
   _Place immediate importance on the cleanup outside Prince
William Sound.
   _Expect to have the cleanup reviewed by state and federal
officials next spring.
   _Continue to have the use of the USS Juneau and USS McHenry as
communications and support vessels.
   _Give the Coast Guard each week a planning schedule that allows
federal authorities to track the progress of the cleanup.
   Robbins said he was speaking for Coast Guard Commandant Paul A.
Yost Jr., who was in Washington, D.C. ``I have consulted the
commandant and he agrees with my letter,'' Robbins said.
   In other spill-related developments Wednesday:
   _State and federal officials reported that an estimated 600
otters have been killed by the oil spill, along with several
thousand birds.
   _Exxon launched an oil ``bounty hunter'' program, paying $5 a
gallon for recovered crude. The company said the bounty hunters
were private boat owners, using their own equipment and fuel, who
skimmed oil from Prince William Sound. There was no immediate word
of how much bounty oil had been recovered.
   _A scientist with the state Department of Environmental
Conservation, Pete McGee, said tests for hydrocarbons in the sound
showed that the water was apparently safe.
   _Exxon ordered 60 mobile homes moved from Anchorage next month
to provide housing for oil company employees working on the
cleanup. Exxon bought the units for $12,000 each, and they will be
installed at a mobile home park by June 14, a day before Exxon
employees must vacate Valdez hotels to make way for summer
tourists. The company reportedly is spending $1.5 million to move
the units, outfit them with new furniture, televisions and dishes,
and hire maids.
   _A 50-foot landing craft involved in the cleanup sank near
Valdez, but the three people aboard were rescued uninjured, the
Coast Guard said. The vessel was under contract to Exxon and an
investigation was under way, said Dave Haulbrook, a Coast Guard
spokesman.

<HEAD>Home Loan Rates Highest in Three Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on both fixed- and
adjustable-rate home loans rose in April to their highest levels in
more than three years, the government reported Wednesday.
   Fixed-rate mortgages in early April rose 0.21 percentage point
from the previous month to 11.58 percent and adjustable-rate
mortgages rose 0.37 point to 10.14 percent, the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board reported.
   Those were the highest levels since December 1985, when
fixed-rate mortgages averaged 12.01 percent and adjustable-rate
home loans averaged 10.39 percent. Rates also had risen strongly in
March.
   ``The sharp two-month increase in ARM rates followed increases
in short-term market interest rates, reflecting Federal Reserve
efforts to restrain inflation,'' said James Barth, chief economist
for the bank board.
   The Federal Reserve for a year has been pushing up interest
rates in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by restraining
economic growth.
   The housing industry, among the sectors of the economy hardest
hit by rising interest rates, has registered sharp declines in
building permits, construction and sales in recent months.
   Despite the rise in ARM rates, the percentage of mortgages
closed with adjustable rates rose to 56 percent in early April, up
slightly from 55 percent in the previous month.
   A separate weekly report released Friday by the Federal Home
Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, showed interest rates
remained relatively high throughout April and into the start of May.
   Fixed-rate mortgages were averaging 10.97 percent last week,
down slightly from 11.03 percent during the previous week. On
one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an average
initial rate of 9.36 percent last week, down from 9.38 percent the
week before, Freddie Mac said.
   The Freddie Mac figures are lower than those reported by the
bank board because they do not include add-on fees, known as
points, which are paid by borrowers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear industry leaders accused federal
regulators Wednesday of overloading plant operators with new and
unneeded safety requirements.
   J. Phillip Bayne, president of the New York Power Authority,
told members of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that despite a
recent trend toward improved safety at nuclear plants, the burden
of NRC safety orders was growing rapidly.
   Bayne also said the commission's staff has gone beyond the
normal bounds of regulation to impose the safety orders.
   ``The perception is that plants are being evaluated on a scale
that is rising, but without the benefit of the formal regulatory
process,'' Bayne said. He and other industry leaders held a
one-hour public session with the commissioners at NRC headquarters
as part of the industry's annual Nuclear Power Assembly.
   Bayne said there had been a fourfold increase between 1987 and
1988 in the number of NRC bulletins to plant operators that require
a specific safety improvement. He said the number of such bulletins
had declined over the previous six years.
   Industry officials think last year's spurt in safety orders may
mean the commission's staff is trying to impose requirements that
go beyond established standards, Bayne said.
   ``This would be a dramatic reversal in NRC policy, and I'd
suggest that there is no evidence of safety concerns that would
justify it,'' he added. ``I acknowledge that this industry has some
poor performers who should and must be called to account, but we,
the industry ... have the means to get their attention.''
   Bayne also complained about what he said was a 50 percent
increase over the past four years in the number of NRC actions that
result in civil penalties against utilities.
   Lando W. Zech Jr., the commission chairman, responded by saying
the technical demands and risks of nuclear power oblige the
industry to try to exceed minimum safety standards.
   ``It bothers me when I hear that we're criticized for
encouraging excellence,'' he said.
   Zech also criticized the industry for giving the NRC
``essentially no cooperation at all'' in attempting to make a new
rule on maintenance standards for nuclear plants.
   Bayne said the industry should be allowed to resolve what he
called isolated problems with maintenance, without the need for new
rules affecting all plants.

<HEAD>Pentagon Spending Plan Too High by $150 Billion: GAO</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's five-year defense plan is
``fiscally unrealistic'' and would cost about $150 billion more
than what Congress would approve, congressional investigators said
Wednesday.
   Charles Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, an
investiagative arm of Congress, told the Senate Armed Services
Committee that his agency had found that the defense spending plan
for fiscal 1990 through 1994 exceeds President Bush's own budget
plan by $45 billion.
   He also said that the Pentagon plan assumes an inflation rate of
3.6 percent in 1990, declining to 1.7 percent in 1994. However, the
Congressional Budget Office and others expect inflation rates of 4
percent or higher for the next five years.
   ``Under CBO's projections, the five-year plan is underfunded by
nearly $48 billion,'' Bowsher said.
   Compounding the problem is the strong possibility that Congress
will approve defense budgets accounting for inflation and providing
for no real increases. That, Bowsher said, would require an
additional $54 billion in Pentagon reductions.
   President Bush has cut Pentagon spending requests for 1990
through 1994 by about $65 billion, but the GAO believes more cuts
are needed.
   The comptroller general also said that the Pentagon has planned
for more than $2 trillion more than provided for in congressional
budget authority.
   ``What is the effect of being that much off on the five-year
defense plan?'' asked Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee's
chairman. ``Does that mean the five-year defense plan has been
essentially worthless?''
   ``It might be close to that,'' Bowsher responded.
   ``What's a word close to worthless,'' Nunn interrupted.
   Bowsher told the panel that ``since the mid-1980s, the
department's five-year defense planning has been fiscally
unrealistic. More weapons were being planned and developed than
could be produced in an economic manner or supported once they were
produced.''
   In a related development, a study released Wednesday by the
liberal Brookings Institution found that the administration has
made unrealistic economic assumptions, but also concluded that
Cheney ``was on the right track'' in choosing to cancel major
weapons systems to trim the budget.
   Lawrence Korb, a former assistant secretary of defense in the
Reagan administration, and William Kaufmann of Harvard University
forecast a gap of $200 billion between projected force levels and
available funds.
   Korb said, however, that Cheney had substantially closed the gap
by canceling the V-22 Osprey aircraft and delaying development of
the B-2 stealth bomber by a year. Korb and Kaufman recommended that
the Pentagon produce only six of B-2s for testing rather than the
entire 132 requested by the Air Force.

<HEAD>Senate Backs Bush in Declaring Bahamas Cooperative in Drug War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Wednesday supported President
Bush's certification of the government of the Bahamas as fully
cooperative in the war on drugs, rejecting an effort to overrule
his action.
   Senators voted 57 to 40 to defeat a resolution offered by Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., to brand the Bahamas as uncooperative in
important areas, a move that would have subjected it to the loss of
50 percent of U.S. aid.
   During debate, Kerry said the Bahamian government has been
uncooperative in many areas _ including effective prosecution of
arrested drug traffickers _ while providing only superficial and
self-serving cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies.
   But opponents said that penalizing the Bahamas would be
counterproductive because it would destroy important progress in
the effort to end the role of the Bahamas as a major transfer point
for narcotics flowing from South America to the United States.
   The president is required under the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986
to certify to Congress that nations in which narcotics are grown _
or which serve as transit points for narcotics _ are either fully
cooperative with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts or are taking adequate
steps of their own.
   Unless countries are certified, they are subject to strong U.S.
economic sanctions, including the loss of half of U.S. economic,
military or other assistance.
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said that the Bahamas have been
remarkably cooperative with U.S. law enforcement officials.
   ``They are the only country to allow unimpeded hot pursuit of
drug traffickers by sea or land,'' DeConcini said.
   He added that the Bahamas have permitted the installation of
radar surveillance equipment, permitted U.S. law enforcement
authorities to conduct undercover operations on Bahamaian soil, and
cooperated in combined operations to arrest drug traffickers and
seize narcotics.
   ``It is estimated that the United States has as many law
enforcement officials in the Bahamas as the Bahamians do,'' De
Concini said.
   But Kerry said he believes the current level of cooperation is
merely a front erected to permit more serious drug operations and
corruption to flourish.
   ``It enables them to pull the wool over our eyes,'' he said.
   ``We've been snookered,'' he said. ``The same thing is taking
place in the Bahamas as happened in Panama, cooperation at one
level, then expansion of a network of narcotics connections.''
   Sen. John Chafee, D-R.I., said, ``The Bahamas probably has some
corruption; I won't certify that it does not. But I do know the
administration has stated that this will not help the situation.''
   However, Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., told the Senate: ``We can't
continue to do business as usual if we are to win the war on the
drugs that are sweeping our country. The most serious concern about
the Bahamas today is their failure to prosecute, convict and remove
from positions of influence persons involved in drug trafficking.''

   Uniformed police and KGB agents in plainclothes
dispersed about 40 Soviet Jews on Wednesday who were demanding
Washington make no trade concessions to the Soviet Union until
Moscow ends all limits on emigration.
   Their protest outside Moscow's International Trade Center came
on the first day of Secretary of State James Baker's visit to
Moscow.
   Protest organizer Yuri Semenovsky said Baker arranged to meet
some of the demonstrators later at the U.S. Embassy.
   The protesters want the United States to keep denying the Soviet
Union most-favored-nation status until emigration limits are
discarded entirely.
   Many of them carried banners asking the U.S. government to
maintain the 1972 Jackson-Vanik amendment that bars trade
concessions to communist states unless the president can state he
has received assurances that emigration will be liberalized.
   One sign read, ``I wait for permission to leave the U.S.S.R. for
10 years.'' Another read, ``Mr. Vanik, we are still here!''
   Charles Vanik, no longer in Congress, suggested last Thursday
that restrictions he had co-sponsored be waived for one year,
saying such action would encourage further human rights
improvements here under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Semenovsky, leader of a refusenik group called ``Poor
Relatives,'' said the amendment should stay put until Moscow passes
a law letting anyone leave who wants to. He said 100,000 people
were refused permission last year.
   According to the Geneva-based Intergovernmental Committee for
Migration, which helps resettle emigres, Jewish emigration from the
Soviet Union rose in April to its highest level since 1979, with
4,129 Soviet Jews allowed to leave.
   Semenovsky claims, however, that many who want to leave are
afraid to apply, or the government will not accept their
applications.

   A Christian Science couple who did not seek
medical attention for their dying son should not be tried for
manslaughter, their lawyer argued Wednesday at the state Supreme
Court.
   The outcome of the case is being watched closely by many of the
estimated 650,000 members of the Christian Science church who shun
doctors and medicine and espouse spiritual healing.
   Rikki Klieman, attorney for David and Ginger Twitchell, told
Judge Herbert Wilkins that state laws are so vague about such
matters a trial would be unfair, and the charges should be
dismissed.
   A 1971 amendment to the state child abuse and neglect law
recognized spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine.
Klieman said the law gives Christian Scientists no guidance as to
the point at which they must call in doctors.
   ``The problem is, they do not know what the law is,'' said
Klieman. ``They know they have been told by the Legislature that
they will not be prosecuted for caring for their children by
spiritual healing. But then they see that if something goes wrong,
or when it goes to a certain point, then they get indicted for
manslaughter.''
   John Kiernan, a special prosecutor representing the state,
argued that it is every parent's duty to care for the children. He
said a jury should have the opportunity to decide if the Twitchells
fulfilled that obligation.
   Klieman said it was unfair to ask a lay jury to decide a case
based on religious beliefs when the laws are unclear.
   Wilkins is expected to decide within two weeks whether to send
the case to the full Supreme Court or to a trial.
   The Twitchells did not appear in court Wednesday.
   According to police reports, the Twitchells' 2{-year-old son,
Robyn, became feverish and lethargic in early April 1986. The
Twitchells contacted a church practitioner, who came to their home
to pray for the boy's recovery.
   On the evening of his death, the boy went into convulsions and
lost consciousness and vital signs. The boy's father first called a
funeral director, who told him to contact the police. The boy was
pronounced dead at Carney Hospital in Boston.
   Klieman has the boy died from complications of a bowel
obstruction caused by a birth defect.
   A jury in Sarasota, Fla., last month found a Christian Science
couple guilty of murder for allowing their 7-year-old diabetic
daughter to die without medical attention.
   William and Christine Hermanson, who remain free pending
sentencing, were the first Christian Scientists in 20 years
prosecuted in the United States for denying a child medical care
for religious reasons, according to the church.
   The Church of Christ, Scientist, is located in Boston and the
denomination has about 3,200 branches worldwide.

<HEAD>Higher Alert For US Personnel in Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Southern Command, responding to an
outbreak of violence in Panama City, upgraded its alert status late
Wednesday for American military personnel and their dependents.
   The command raised its so-called Personnel Movement Limitation
alert from a ``Bravo'' level to a ``Charlie,'' meaning servicemen
and their families were told to ``limit all movement.''
   A PML-Charlie, in military parlance, means that ``major civil
disturbances are occurring (and personnel) should not go into
public areas in Panama except for essential business.''
   ``Limit your travel to work, non-affected areas or another
defense site ... and monitor Southern Command broadcasts closely to
avoid trouble areas,'' the alert adds.
   The previous alert, a PML-Bravo, was issued shortly before last
weekend's national elections and simply advised servicemen to
``decrease visibility'' because ``some civil disturbance activity
is probable.''
   The Pentagon said it had been advised the Southern Command
tightened the alert at 4:45 p.m. EDT Wednesday.
   No other special precautions or troop movements have been
ordered, the Pentagon added.
   The change in alert status came amid reports that Panamanian
opposition candidate Guillermo Endara had been injured Wednesday
afternoon when police using tear gas and gunfire broke up a protest
of the government's vote count in the presidential election.
   Endara and his two vice presidential candidates were leading an
auto caravan in Panama City when riot police began using tear gas
and birdshot to disperse the demonstrators.
   The violence began when the caravan encountered a police
blockade as it approached the downtown area. Opposition spokesmen
said several people were arrested, including Endara's press
secretary, Luis Martins.
   Endara was taken to a hospital, his head bleeding and his shirt
covered with blood, the opposition coalition said in a statement.
   ``The wound apparently is not serious; they're giving him first
aid,'' said Maria de Montenegro, a secretary at Endara's office.

   The government under Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega Wednesday expelled nine foreign journalists and
accused them of spreading misinformation on the political crisis, a
government spokesman said.
   ``These foreign correspondents have been misinforming in their
dispatches on the electoral process. Consequently, the Social
Communications Media Bureau has decided to ask them to leave the
country immediately,'' Luis Romero Villalobos, the bureau director,
told reporters.
   The bureau is part of the Ministry of Justice and Government,
which is also in charge of internal security.
   Among those expelled were Charles Jaco, an American working for
Cable News Network, and Michael Drudge and Ruben del Castillo of
the U.S. government's Voice of America, Romero said.
   Drudge is an American based in San Jose, Costa Rica.
   Also expelled were Domenique Petite and Arturo Gudino of Agence
France-Press, Jose Melendez and Javier Rojas of the Mexico City
newspaper Excelsior, and Lafit Fernandez of Costa Rica and Joaquin
Ibarz of the Spanish newspaper Vanguardia.
   The others' nationalities were not immediately availble.

   A veterinarian headed the medical operation of
the government's Fernald uranium-processing plant in Ohio until
recently, union officials told a congressional panel Wednesday.
   ``To me it is an obvious example of the casual attitude the
(Department of Energy) and their contractors took when dealing with
the health and very lives of the men and women who worked at these
facilities,'' Elmer Chatak of the AFL-CIO's industrial union
department told the House Health and Safety Subcommittee.
   A spokesman for the Feed Materials Production Center confirmed
that David Howell, who holds a degree in veterinary medicine, was
the plant's manager of medical services until April 13.
   Howell, who also holds an undergraduate degree in health
sciences and a graduate degree in pathology, did not ``perform
medical evaluations'' and was not considered the supervisor of the
three physicians who work at the plant on a subcontract basis, said
William Kelley, a spokesman for the plant's operator, Westinghouse
Materials of Ohio.
   ``He has not been a practicing veteriarian at all since his
affliation with Westinghouse,'' Kelley said.
   The medical services job involves overseeing medical records and
technologists, Kelley said. A new administrator has not yet been
named, he added.
   Howell was moved to another department as part of major
reorganization in which many department heads were changed, the
spokesman said.
   The Fernald plant, 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati, processes
uranium for use in nuclear weapons or as fuel for reactors.
   It is the subject of a $300 million suit on behalf of 14,000
people who live or work nearby and believe their health has been
threatened by radioactive discharges into the air and water. The
government has admitted ignoring or undermining efforts to reduce
pollution there.
   The government has estimated that as much as 552,000 pounds of
radioactive uranium dust may have escaped into the air from the
plant. An engineering consultant's report prepared as part of the
lawsuit said releases could be as high as 3.1 million pounds over
37 years.
   Workers have been complaining that they weren't adequately
protected from or told about the dangerous substances to which they
were exposed. Most of those complaints have been directed against
the plant's former operator, NLO Inc., which ran the plant until
1985.
   David Day, president of the Fernald Atomic Trades and Labor
Council, said workers had been unhappy with the plant's medical
staff in the past but that he is satisfied with recent changes and
with the current physicians.
   ``There were doctors that are no longer there that made
diagnoses that were incorrect,'' he said. ``Those doctors have been
replaced.''
   Wrong diagnoses included ``women who were told they had cancer
and they didn't have cancer,'' he said.
   Such episodes led workers to trust only certain doctors and
increased workers' fears about the risks associated with working at
the plant, Day said.
   Concerns increase with each new revelation about the extent of
radioactive releases over the years, he said.

   Except for the white hair, it could have
been railroad entrepreneur Leland Stanford standing between
steam-belching locomotives Wednesday driving in a gold spike that
bound the nation together by rail.
   Like Stanford 120 years ago, actor Sam Gordon missed on his
first swing with the sledge. So did the actorportraying Union
Pacific's Thomas Durant.
   ``They were totally inebriated as far as we know,'' said John
Stewart, a Utah State University historian and frock-coated member
of the local troupe that annually re-enacts the makeshift ceremony.
   Nearly 2,000 people gathered at this spot near the Great Salt
Lake to watch giant steam locomotives come face to face as they did
May 10, 1869.
   Gordon, nearly 80 and a teetotaler, has played Stanford since
1961 and co-directs the 18-member cast. He apologized for his
snow-white mane.
   ``I feel kind of bad because Leland Stanford had black hair''
and was 45 at the time, Gordon said. ``I thought it was OK because
Leland got older, too.''
   Once the ceremonial spikes were placed, another sledge and
spike, both attached to the telegraph wire, were used to alert a
waiting nation that the 1,776-mile line was finished.
   ``The last rail is laid! The last spike is driven! The Pacific
Railroad is completed!'' read the telegram from Durant and Stanford
to President Ulysses S. Grant.
   Stanford was a former governor of California and president of
the Central Pacific Railroad. He later represented California in
the U.S. Senate.
   A bottle of champagne was broken over the ceremonial tie and
Central Pacific's ``Jupiter'' engine and Union Pacific's ``119''
were driven over it. After the ceremonial tie was removed _ it
burned in the San Francisco fire of 1906 _ historians believe an
unknown Chinese worker probably drove the last steel spike into a
wooden tie.
   If so, it was only fitting.
   Using up to 400 kegs of blasting powder a day, some 12,000
Chinese immigrants labored dawn to dusk for about $30 a month
without board to carve a rail bed out of the granite of the Sierras.
   It took them more than a year to bore a 1,650-foot tunnel at
Donner's Summit, four years to pound the 690 miles from Sacramento,
Calif., to this sagebrush-dotted valley which has been home to the
Golden Spike National Historic Site since 1969.
   Occasionally, National Park Service employees find shards of
broken rice bowls and brass opium boxes furnished to the workers by
the railroad.
   ``It was their way of keeping them happy,'' said Park Service
engineer Bob Dowty.
   Two weeks before the rails merged in 1869, the Central Pacific
crews had laid a record 10 miles and 56 feet of track in a single
day.
   Durant's Union Pacific crews, made up largely of ex-soldiers of
the Union and Confederacy and young Irish and German immigrants,
hammered 1,086 miles over the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains from
the Missouri River, frequently braving Indian attack.
   The rail link was completed six years ahead of schedule at an
estimated cost of $500 million.
   ``The minute that spike was driven, you changed six months from
Omaha to Sacramento to six days,'' Dowty said.
   Historians generally agree that the mammoth enterprise that grew
out of the Pacific Railroad Act, signed by Abraham Lincoln in 1862,
was the single most significant reason for the rapid settlement of
America west of the Mississippi during the late 19th century.
   Wednesday's re-enactment was the 10th involving two
black-red-and-gold, full-sized replicas of the eastbound Jupiter
and westbound 119. The locomotives cost $750,000 each and were the
first steam engines built in the United States in a quarter century.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney defended the
proposed $7 billion FSX warplane deal with Japan on Wednesday as
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee considered a resolution to
disapprove the controversial co-production arrangement.
   Addressing charges that the deal will give the Japanese vital
U.S. technology, Cheney told the committee:
   ``We are not giving them unrestricted access to all the
technology that goes with our capability to design and produce
advanced fighter aircraft,''
   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the committee's ranking
Republican, strongly disagreed.
   ``The FSX program is a bad deal for America. ... The FSX will be
the laboratory and training ground for the design, production,
avionics and other engineering talent necessary to build a
world-class Japanese civilian aircraft industry.''
   The committee originally was scheduled to vote on the FSX issue
Wednesday afternoon. But Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,
D-Maine, later said the vote had been postponed until Thursday
after Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, requested a closed-door
intelligence briefing Thursday morning on reports of involvement by
Japanese companies in a weapons complex being built in Libya.
   During the hearing, Murkowski said he was ``disturbed'' by the
role of Japanese firms in helping to construct the Libyan complex
at Rabta, which includes a suspected poison gas plant as well as a
metal fabrication plant to produce bomb and shell casings.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger told the
committee there was no evidence that Mitsubishi Heavy Industries,
the prime Japanese contractor for the FSX, had any involvement with
the Rabta complex.
   ``Other Japanese companies were involved in the metal
fabrication plant, not the chemical plant,'' Eagleburger said.
   Even if the resolution passes the House and the Senate, a
two-thirds majority in both houses would still be required to
override a presidential veto, which would be considered likely.
   Under the deal, General Dynamics would join with Mitsubishi to
co-develop and co-produce the FSX, an advanced version of the U.S.
F-16, for deployment by Japan in the late 1990s. General Dynamics
is headquartered in St. Louis, but most of the FSX work would be
done at its F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas.
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, who earlier had raised
concerns within the administration over economic implications of
the FSX deal, told the committee: ``I am confident that this
agreement will not harm the economic security interests of the
United States.''
   Cheney, asked about how solid he views a promise by the Japanese
that approximately 40 percent of the production work on the FSX
would be handled by U.S. companies, replied, ``We think that it's
solid _ as solid as it can be.''
   Proponents of the FSX deal have argued that it will give the
United States valuable ``flowback'' of Japanese technology
involving composite wing construction and phased-array radars.
   But Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., said a report by the General
Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, has already
concluded that these technologies are well known to U.S. aerospace
companies.
   ``The evidence clearly before us is that we're really not
getting anything in return,'' Dixon said.
   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the technology flowback
argument ``total nonsense and a facade to cover up the shortcomings
of this deal.''
   Senators speaking in favor of the deal included Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, D-N.M., who argued that if the United States scraps the
agreement, Japan will build the new fighter completely on its own
or in conjunction with a European country.
   ``There is going to be an FSX,'' Bingaman said. ``I think that
if we do not participate we will lose economic benefits and we will
lose technological benefits.''
   Also backing the deal was Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., who
said voting against the FSX would amount to acting in a ``fit of
pique'' over the U.S.-Japan $55 billion trade deficit and other
outstanding economic issues.

<HEAD>U.S. Officials Say Drug Smugglers Took Over Bahamian Island</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drug traffickers have all but taken over the
Bahamian island of South Bimini, chasing off U.S. patrol boats with
gunfire and intimidating the Bahamian military, say Customs Service
reports and law enforcement officials.
   A Bahamian police lieutenant on the island even removed a
suspected drug smuggler from a U.S. boat and freed him, says a U.S.
Customs Service report obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press.
   Customs Service spokesman Michael Sheehan and Coast Guard
spokesman Lt. Jeff Karonis refused to give details of the case,
saying the matter is being handled by the U.S. Embassy in Nassau,
the Bahamas.
   Bahamian government spokesman Edward Ellis said he could not
comment immediately on the incidents.
   Drug officials are reluctant to talk on the record about the
situation for fear of endangering joint U.S.-Bahamian drug
interdiction efforts, but said privately that the island is out of
control.
   ``The situation in South Bimini is near anarchy,'' a federal law
enforcement official said Wednesday, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``The drug smugglers alone control the island, and
police corruption is obvious.''
   U.S. drug officials have long complained of high-level
protection of drug smugglers and a 1984 Royal Commission of Inquiry
found low-level corruption. The Bahamian government strenuously
denies any wrongdoing by current leaders, however.
   On Wednesday, the Senate defeated 57-40 a resolution by Sen.
John Kerry, D-Mass., to revoke President Bush's certification that
the government of the Bahamas has fully cooperated in the war on
drugs. Decertification could have cost the Bahamas nearly all of
its U.S. foreign aid and other privileges.
   South Bimini, only about 45 miles from Florida, was finally
raided May 7 by Bahamian troops who made at least one arrest and
seized six pounds of marijuana and two weapons. U.S. Embassy
officials point to the raid by the Royal Bahamian Defense Force to
show good faith by the nation's government.
   ``They sent in about 50 RBDF people _ that's a major raid for
here. I don't think that's any evidence of lack of cooperation,''
said Martin Cheshes, charge d'affaires at the embassy in Nassau.
   But drug agents here say they are not impressed with the
Bahamian raid, complaining that such actions are rare and usually
late.
   ``It is gotten to the point that our people are being shot at by
snipers using machine guns,'' the law enforcement source said.
``The Bahamian government is closing its eyes to what's going on,
allowing Bimini to be used as a thoroughfare for drugs.''
   The raid was staged five days after Coast Guard and Customs
Service officials, assisted by the Royal Bahamian Defense Force,
responded to an apparent air-drop of drugs on South Bimini's coast
and were thwarted by angry crowds.
   Cheshes said the delay was caused by the time it took reports to
get to Nassau, and the difficulty of mounting a major operation in
the small country.
   Two boats believed involved in the drop were intercepted and
three people taken into custody. But when the group docked outside
the South Bimini Hotel to allow the Bahamian soldiers to search for
drugs, about 75 people gathered, according to the Customs report.
   ``The angry crowd would not let the RBDF on shore to search for
the contraband,'' the report said.
   The task force withdrew and then intercepted another vessel
carrying two Cuban-Americans and two Bahamians.
   The two Bahamians insisted repeatedly on being taken to the
South Bimini police station instead of RBDF headquarters on another
island.
   One Bahamian jumped overboard and swam to shore. When the
Customs boats headed to shore to rearrest him, a Bahamian police
lieutenant took the second Bahamian off the boat and freed him at
the hotel while another crowd gathered.
   The Bahamian soldiers threatened to fire on the crowd, but
members of the mob said they would shoot back and the task force
again decided to withdraw. The following day, a U.S. Customs vessel
returned to the island and came under small arms fire, the report
said.

   Israelis filled beaches and parks to celebrate
their independence day Wednesday while bloodshed continued in the
occupied lands. Two Arabs were reported killed and 13 wounded.
   Confrontations between stone-throwing youths and Israeli
soldiers took place despite army curfews that confined more than
half the 1.7 million Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
to their homes.
   Curfews and blocking of roads from the territories for a third
day were designed to keep Palestinians from entering Israel during
Memorial Day on Tuesday, when Israelis honored their war dead, and
the Independence Day observance.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir was hospitalized for tests after
complaining of tiredness. Earlier, he elaborated on his peace
proposal in Independence Day interviews broadcast Wednesday on
Israel radio. It calls for elections in the occupied lands for
representatives to negotiate with Israel on limited Palestinian
self-rule.
   That ``interim agreement'' would be followed in two years by
talks on a final settlement.
   His comments in Hebrew and English appeared contradictory on
whether Israel was willing to talk with Palestinians intent on an
independent state.
   In Hebrew, after repeating his refusal to deal the Palestine
Liberation Organization, Shamir said: ``We have to talk to people
who are interested in a solution ... those who don't insist on this
minimum demand for a Palestinian state.''
   In English, when asked how Palestinians could be persuaded to
negotiate if Israel insisted on continued rule in the occupied
lands, he said the negotiators could propose whatever they wished.
   ``Therefore,'' he added, ``I can suppose that the Israeli side
will propose Israeli sovereignty and the Arab side will ask for
Palestinian sovereignty.'' Both the PLO and leading Palestinians in
the occupied lands have rejected Shamir's proposal on grounds it
does not recognize their national aspirations.
   Also Wednesday, a Foreign Ministry official said the United
States is pressuring Israel to calm violence in the occupied
territories and proceed with Shamir's elections plan.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed
reports that Secretary of State James A. Baker III sent a letter
ten days ago to his Israeli counterpart, Moshe Arens, expressing
support for elections as part of a peace plan.
   Jewish settlers used Independence Day to inaugurate two new
settlements in the occupied West Bank.
   Organizers said about 50 families will live in Ofarim, in the
north, and Tzorfim, near Jerusalem. They are among eight new
settlements approved for construction this year and join about 130
existing settlements, which are home to about 70,000 Jews.
   Western governments, including the United States, see the
settlements as an obstacle to peace.
   In renewed clashes in the occupied West Bank, troops shot and
killed two Palestinians, an army spokesman said. The spokesman also
confirmed two Arabs wounded and said other reports were being
checked.
   Arabs sources reported a total of 13 wounded in the occupied
lands on Wednesday.
   The army spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity,
said one Palestinian was shot and killed as he was about to throw a
firebomb at an army jeep on the Jerusalem-Bethlehem highway.
Another Arab was wounded, the spokesman said.
   Arab reporters told a slightly different story. They said the
Palestinian was shot and killed while he and some companions were
standing along the highway throwing stones at cars driven by
Israeli settlers. The cars were flying large blue-and-white Israeli
flags from their rooftops for Independence Day.
   An Israeli paramilitary border policeman spotted the
Palestinians and opened fire, killing one of the stone-throwers,
the reporters said. They also reported two Arabs wounded.
   Arab hospital officials identified the slain man as 24-year-old
Sayez Ismaeel Musa. They said he was fatally wounded in the chest.
   In the town of Ramallah, troops opened fire to disperse about
200 Palestinians who were throwing stones, killing one and wounding
another, the army spokesman said.
   Mahoud Sami Abdul Ranni, 17, arrived dead at Ramallah Hospital
with a gunshot wound to the chest, hospital officials said.
   The deaths brought to 469 the number of Palestinians killed in
the 17-month uprising. Twenty-one Israelis have also died in the
violence.
   Elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, 10 Palestinians were
wounded by army gunfire, Arab sources said.

<HEAD>Support Group Prolongs Breast Cancer Survival, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breast cancer patients offered a
psychological support group lived an average of almost 18 months
longer than women who received only standard medical care,
concludes a study released Wednesday.
   ``I was quite stunned,'' said researcher David Spiegel, ``since
it was so contrary to what we expected to find.''
   The research provoked some skeptical reactions. One scientist
who has studied the impact of psychology on cancer said she found
the new results questionable.
   Spiegel, of the Stanford University School of Medicine,
presented the study at the annual meeting of the American
Psychiatric Association. He did the study with colleagues at
Stanford and the University of California at Berkeley.
   The work focused on the survival times of 86 women whose breast
cancer had spread elsewhere in their bodies. By random selection,
50 women were given a chance to participate in a weekly support
group for a year.
   Ten years later, researchers compared the survival times of the
two groups of people. Only a few women were still alive, and for
the study they were included as if they had died at the end of the
10 years.
   Analysis showed that the average survival time of women offered
the support group was 36.6 months, in contrast to 18.9 months for
the other women. Survival time was measured from the point the
women entered the study.
   Analysis showed that the survival difference began to appear
about eight months after the support group began, Spiegel said.
   Women in the support group category were comparable to those in
the comparison category on key characteristics, except for stage of
cancer at the time they were diagnosed. Support group women on
average were at an earlier stage, but Spiegel said further analysis
convinced him that staging did not explain the survival difference.
   Troy Thompson, psychiatry professor at Jefferson Medical College
in Philadelphia, said in an interview after Spiegel's talk that the
staging difference still made him skeptical.
   The research should be duplicated to see if the same result
occurs, he said. ``Sometimes when something sounds too good to be
true, it is,'' he said.
   Barrie Cassileth, director of psychosocial research at the
University of Pennsylvania Cancer Center, said in a telephone
interview that the study's conclusion was ``highly questionable.''
   While conclusions were based on survival of the 50 women who
were offered the support group, only 34 attended any sessions and
only 18 attended more than 10 sessions, she noted from the reported
data.
   So it is not clear whether enough women attended enough sessions
to be sure the program really had a chance to influence survival,
Cassileth said.
   Cassileth said, however that research into psychological impacts
on cancer should be encouraged and that support groups are
important for improving quality of life and social interaction for
cancer patients.
   Another researcher who has studied psychological impacts on
cancer said that despite some limitations in the new study, she
believes it does suggest the support groups made a difference.
   ``It looked to me that they have something,'' said Sandra Levy,
associate professor of psychiatry and medicine at the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Delays Action on Bush's Arms Negotiator, Approves Other
Post</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee on
Wednesday recommended Senate approval of six key diplomatic
appointments but delayed action on three others, including that of
Richard R. Burt to be the new U.S. strategic arms negotiator.
   Burt, now U.S. ambassador to West Germany and a former assistant
secretary of state for European affairs, is under fire by Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., for allegedly publishing classified material a
decade ago in the position he then held as a national security
correspondent for The New York Times.
   Helms asserted at a hearing last week that a June 29, 1979
article headlined ``US Plans New Way to Check Soviet Missile
Tests,'' disclosed ``highly classified information'' involving the
then-new U.S. chalet satellite system. Helms said the Pentagon
believed the disclosure that an antenna associated with the system
was located at a base in Norway would jeopardize Norway's delicate
relations with the Soviet Union.
   Burt said he wrote the story ``not believing at the time that
this would be extremely damaging.''
   Helms also questioned Burt's relationship with a New York Times
reporter while he held his State Department position.
   Helms contended that the reporter, Judith Miller, published a
number of articles allegedly based on classified material
concerning issues with which Burt dealt professionally. The senator
implied, but did not explicitly state, that Burt may have been Miss
Miller's source.
   Burt said he never provided such information to Miss Miller or
any other reporter and that he and Miss Miller had a clear
understanding that he would not do so.
   Burt said he had told Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr.
and his successor, George P. Shultz, that he and Miss Miller had a
social relationship. He said they had told him it was ``none of
their business'' because they trusted Burt's discretion and sense
of responsibility.
   A reporter who twice telephoned the office in New York of Max
Frankel, the Times' executive editor, was told Wednesday there was
no one immediately available to comment.
   Helm's objection to the immediate consideration of the Burt
nomination delays action on it for at least once week.
   The committee also postponed action, apparently for technical
reasons, on the nominations of Michigan Republican activist Peter
F. Secchia to be U.S. ambassador to Italy and Douglas P. Mulholland
to be assistant secretary of state for intelligence and research.
   The panel recommended Senate approval of these nominations:
   _Charles E. Redman, a former State Department spokesman, to be
ambassador to Sweden.
   _Walter J. P. Curley, a New York executive, to be ambassador to
France.
   _Joseph Vernor Reed, to hold the rank of ambassador while
serving as chief of protocol for the White House.
   _Ronald F. Lehman II to be director of the U.S. Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency.
   _Herman Jay Cohen to be an assistant secretary of State for
African affairs.
   _Morris B. Abram to be the U.S. representative to the European
office of the United Nations.
   A committee fight is expected to erupt Friday during
confirmation hearings on the qualifications of Donald Gregg to
serve as ambassador to South Korea. Gregg was Bush's national
security adviser when Bush was vice president.
   Several Democratic senators, including Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., believe Gregg misled the congressional Iran-Contra
committees as to the role played in the affair by both himself and
Bush. Some Republicans say Democrats are attacking Gregg out of
partisan considerations.
   Some committee members, meanwhile, complain that the
administration has been unusually slow in submitting nominations
for many key diplomatic and State Department positions.
   Nominations have yet to be received, for example, to fill the
posts of assistant secretaries of state for Europe, Asia, the Near
East and Latin America.

<HEAD>Carmina Leaves Hospital</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ROSA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 3-year-old recovering from wounds
allegedly suffered when her father slashed her throat in a bloody
murder spree was quietly released from a hospital Wednesday and
left with her grandfather.
   Carmina Salcido ``was really in a good mood. She knew she was
leaving and she was excited about that,'' said Petaluma Valley
Hospital spokeswoman Mary Frost.
   Carmina's grandfather, Robert Richards of Cotati, applied for
her custody following the April rampage in which Ramon Salcido
allegedly murdered his wife, two daughters, his mother-in-law, two
sisters-in-law and a co-worker.
   Carmina was found abandoned at a Sonoma County dump along with
her two sisters, Sofia, 4, and Teresa, 1. All had their throats
cut; only Carmina survived.
   Frost said the child's morning departure with her grandfather
and other relatives was kept secret to allow the family to ``leave
in peace,'' without the news media fanfare generated by the
slayings.
   She declined to say where the family will live.
   Doctors will see Carmina to make sure her wound heals properly
during the next few months, Frost said, and although she may have
cosmetic surgery to lessen the scar on her neck, she won't require
additional surgery.
   A tracheotomy performed on Carmina will be removed in a few
weeks and doctors expect no lasting damage to her larynx. ``She's
more than whispering. She's talking,'' Frost said.
   Before Carmina's release, officials met in a closed hearing
before Sonoma County Superior Court Judge Arnold Rosenfield to
discuss her custody. Rosenfield ordered hearing participants not to
discuss the matter and set another hearing for May 30.
   Salcido's preliminary hearing has been set for September, but
Sonoma County Public Defender Marteen Miller has said he will ask
the court to rule Salcido's arrest and deportation from his native
Mexico after the crimes were illegal.
   Salcido could face the death penalty if convicted of the murders
that authorities said may have been fueled by jealousy, drug abuse
and marital trouble.
   The killings and Carmina's survival elicited contributions of
hundreds of toys and stuffed animals for her from well-wishers
around the country.
   In addition, more than $180,000 has been collected in 10
separate trust funds for the families of people authorities say
were slain by Salcido.
   A trust fund for Carmina was opened Wednesday with $1,065
donated by jail officers and inmates at the same jail where her
father is held. Money will continue to be collected for two weeks,
then the fund will be closed until Carmina turns 13.
   That account was initiated by a prisoner counseling group run by
the Rev. Bob Gutleben, the Sonoma County jail's unofficial chaplain.
   He said inmates, many of them abused as children, suggested the
10-year account so funds will be available ``for whatever special
needs she may develop'' as she becomes a teen-ager.

<HEAD>Soviet Bloc Joins West to Delay Vote on PLO Membership</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet bloc delegations and the West united on
Wednesday to delay for two days a decision on the PLO bid for full
membership in the World Health Organization. Arab nations had
sought an immediate vote.
   Most African delegations also supported a motion, proposed by
Austria and seconded by Canada, to delay the choice between rival
resolutions until Friday.
   It carried 56-47 with 20 abstentions, mostly by Latin American
countries, according to an unofficial tally.
   Of the 160 delegations, 37 were absent. Votes were cast by
holding up nameplates of member nations.
   Iraq said after the vote it had wanted a roll call, but that
Chen Min-Zhang of China, the chairman, ignored the request to speak.
   Two draft resolutions are before the WHO assembly. One,
sponsored by all 21 Arab members, would have the organization
decide ``to admit the State of Palestine.''
   The other is designed to avert a showdown with the United
States, which has threatened to halt payments to any U.N. agency
that gives full membership to the Palestine Liberation
Organization, which now has non-voting observer status in the U.N.
system. In November, the PLO legislative body declared an
independent Palestinian state.
   Nine Western and Third World countries support the compromise,
which would combine deferral of the issue until the 1990 assembly
with a call for more aid to residents of the Israeli-occupied
lands, where a Palestinian uprising began 17 months ago.
   By adopting it, the assembly also would express hope ``that the
Palestinian people will be fully represented within the WHO by
their legitimate representatives.''
   That language apparently addresses developing countries that
sympathize with the PLO application but are worried by the warning
from Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director general of WHO, that loss of
U.S. funds would ``completely destroy the agency.'' The United
States this year paid the agency $71 million, a quarter of its
annual budget.
   The United States and its Western allies say the nation
proclaimed by the PLO does not fulfill internationally accepted
criteria of statehood, including control of a defined territory and
a capital.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker II has said admitting the PLO
would harm the Middle East peace process and the entire U.N. system.
   On Tuesday, the PLO said it would apply for admission to three
more U.N. agencies: the U.N. Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization, based in Paris; the Food and Agriculture Organization
in Rome and the International Labor Organization, whose
headquarters are in Geneva.
   The labor organization probably would be the next target because
its annual conference opens June 7 and its statutes allow
applications for membership to be submitted at any time, even
during the meeting. Admission would require a two-thirds majority,
however, rather than the simple majority stipulated by WHO.
   From 1977 to 1980, the United States withdrew from the
International Labor Organization to protest what it described as
politicization and an anti-Western bias.
   U.S. contributions to the World Health Organization this year
total about $94 million to the regular budget and special programs
to fight specific diseases.

   Published comments by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman on Hitler's Waffen-SS troops has
damaged West Germany's international image, a Greens party federal
lawmaker charged Wednesday.
   Jutta Oesterle-Schwerin, speaking to Parliament, referred to an
interview with chief government spokesman Hans Klein published last
Thursday in the illustrated magazine Quick.
   ``The Waffen-SS were fighting troops, not criminals,'' Klein was
quoted as saying in the interview. ``They believed that they must
defend their homeland.''
   The Waffen-SS were military units in the SS, the Nazis' special
police.
   Ms. Oesterle-Schwerin told Parliament the government should
clarify its position on Klein's comments, ``which have damaged our
international image.''
   After the article was published, the leader of West Germany's
Jewish community, Heinz Galinski, also protested and said Klein's
remarks should not go without criticism.
   Galinski pointed out that some Waffen-SS units served as guards
at Nazi concentration camps, where millions of Jews were
exterminated or died of disease and malnutrition.
   Galinski himself was the only member of his immediate family to
survive internment at the Auschwitz concentration camp in what is
now Poland.
   Klein was not available in Bonn for comment Wednesday.
   Kohl's chief of staff, Rudolf Seiters, said the spokesman would
clarify his position at a later Parliament session.
   Last year, Philipp Jenninger was forced to resign as president
of the Bundestag, or parliament, after a controversial speech in
which he gave an inflammatory explanation of Hitler's appeal to the
German people.
   Jenninger said many Germans considered Hitler's march through
Europe ``triumphal'' and he bluntly referred to the widespread
anti-Semitism among Germans that allowed Hitler's repression of
Jews.

<HEAD>Dispute Hits Kohl Government Over Handling of NATO Missile Feud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major dispute has broken out within
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition government over the handling of
NATO's missile feud by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher,
officials said Wednesday.
   The Munich newspaper Sueddeutsche Zeitung said Genscher angered
Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg by not toning down remarks
aimed at the United States and Britain about short-range nuclear
weapons.
   It said officials within Kohl's Christian Democratic Union and
its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, fear the
NATO feud could damage West German-U.S. relations.
   Sources within the parties, speaking on condition of anonymity,
confirmed the newspaper's account.
   Kohl and Genscher have called for East-West negotiations to
reduce short-range nuclear weapons, which would be used on German
soil. The United States and Britain strongly oppose such talks.
   Genscher has taken the lead in pressing the issue, while Kohl
appears to be standing back to give North Atlantic Treaty
Organization nations a chance to patch up differences.
   In TV and radio interviews, Genscher has also been vocal in his
opposition to making an immediate decision on whether to upgrade
NATO's short-range nuclear missiles.
   He said on May 4, ``We have the first and last word about the
stationing of rockets on our territory, and no one else.''
   Most NATO short-range nuclear weapons are based in West Germany.
   Sueddeutsche Zeitung quoted Stoltenberg as saying Genscher ``is
not among those who contribute to a calming'' of NATO's internal
dispute.
   It further quoted him as saying, ``It is comical that Genscher
appeals for other coalition partners to soften their own remarks
while he constantly speaks his own mind.''
   Stoltenberg is a Christian Democrat. Genscher is a Free
Democrat, the junior partner in Kohl's coalition.
   The newspaper reported Michaela Geiger, foreign affairs expert
of the Christian Social Union, as accusing Genscher of using his
power within the coalition to give the mistaken impression that the
Bonn government wants short-range nuclear weapons eliminated
completely.
   Other Christian Social Union and Christian Democratic officials
fear the NATO feud could ``damage the American view of Germany,''
the newspaper said.
   The comments were made during a private meeting Monday night of
officials of the sister parties, the newspaper said.
   The Defense Ministry meanwhile announced that Stoltenberg would
visit the United States from May 17-19 for discussions that will
include defense topics.
   He will meet with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Secretary of
State James A. Baker III, said ministry spokesman Winfried Dunkel.
   The Warsaw Pact also wants negotiations on short-range nuclear
weapons, and denounces NATO plans to upgrade its short-range Lance
rockets.
   NATO says Lance missiles will be have be replaced because of
their age, and plans to upgrade the rockets by extending their
range.
   The West German news magazine Stern quoted Yuli Kvitsinsky, the
Soviet ambassador in Bonn, as saying that increasing the range of
Lance rockets would ``destroy the basis'' of the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty, under which the two superpowers are
eliminating intermediate-range nuclear rockets.
   ``If NATO now builds a missile that perhaps has a range of 20 to
50 kilometers (12 to 30 miles) less than our SS-23, that is a
betrayal,'' Kvitsinsky was quoted as saying.
   Soviet SS-23 rockets are being eliminated under the INF treaty.
   Stern telexed excerpts of the interview to other news
organizations in advance of Thursday's publication.

   Severe thunderstorms rattled through the Plateau region west of
the central Rockies on Wednesday, and heavy rain fell in much of
New Jersey.
   A thunderstorm in southwestern Montana produced wind gusts of up
to 75 mph near Butte.
   In Idaho, a late morning thunderstorm produced high winds at
Palisades that destroyed a small shed and damaged roofs and storm
doors. Later, one-inch diameter hail fell at Burley, in southern
Idaho.
   A severe thunderstorm watch also took in parts of western
Wyoming.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from southern Texas to
northern Florida and southern Georgia, with the showers and
thunderstorms most numerous along the central Gulf Coast, and
across Florida and Georgia.
   Rain showers fell from the lower Great Lakes region and the
upper Ohio Valley across southern New England.
   Through mid-Wednesday, about two-thirds to 1{ inches of rain
fell in northern New Jersey, where flood watches were issued.
   Skies were mostly sunny in the Southwestern deserts, across much
of the Great Plains region and upper Mississippi Valley, and in the
upper Great Lakes region.
   Rainfall totals for the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT ranged up to
1.7 inches at Millville, N.J., and .82 inches as Jacksonville, Fla.
   Record low temperatures for the date were 37 degrees in Kansas
City, Mo., and 43 in South Bend, Ind.
   Temperatures warmed into the 70s across the northern Plains
region, 80s across the Florida peninsula, southern Texas, and the
Southwestern deserts. Clouds and rain kept temperatures in the 40s
and 50s in the lower Great Lakes region and the upper Ohio Valley.
   Temperatures were in the 50s and 60s in the upper Great Lakes
region, but were expected to drop back into the 30s overnight.
Frost and freeze warnings were posted for northern and western
Lower Michigan.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 43
degrees at Bradford, Pa., to 90 degrees at Avon Park, Fla., and
West Palm Beach, Fla. The low for the nation Wednesday morning was
27 degrees at Marquette, Mich.
   The forecast for Thursday was scattered showers and
thunderstorms extending across much of the nation west of the Great
Plains, and most numerous across Utah, Nevada, Idaho and western
Montana. Numerous rain showers were predicted across the upper Ohio
Valley, lower Great Lakes region and the middle and northern
Atlantic Coast states.
   High temperatures were forecast below 70 degrees from North
Carolina and Tennessee to the Great Lakes and the northern Atlantic
Coast, and along the Pacific Coast and west of the central Rockies;
the lower 80s in North Dakota and northeastern Montana; and, above
80 from southern California through southern and central Texas to
southern Florida.

   The commander of U.S. naval
forces in the Philippines and other Navy personnel mourned
Wednesday at a ceremony over the flag-draped coffins of six sailors
killed by a ship fire.
   The bodies of the six, who died Tuesday, arrived at this
American-run base 50 miles north of Manila on a Navy C-2 transport
plane.
   Three weeks earlier, an explosion inside a gun turret on the
battleship Iowa left 47 sailors dead off Puerto Rico.
   In Tuesday's accident, the sailors were killed and five others
injured Tuesday when fire broke out in the engine room of the USS
White Plains. It was in the South China Sea 100 miles east of Hong
Kong, heading back to the Pacific island of Guam after supporting
Persian Gulf operations.
   About 100 people were on hand Wednesday when the coffins, each
draped in an American flag, were taken off a the plane.
   ``We mourn six brave Americans in this tragic accident,'' Rear
Adm. Roger Rich, commander of U.S. naval forces in the Philippines,
said during the ceremony. ``This is an irreplaceable loss for our
country. This is an irreplaceable loss for the American people.''
   Crewmen aboard the White Plains, a food stores ship, battled the
blaze for more than an hour before bringing it under control.
   U.S. officials said the White Plains was being towed toward the
American-run base at Subic Bay, 50 miles west of Manila. Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Kevin Mukri said the vessel was expected to
arrive by Sunday.
   He said a U.S. Navy team was being assembled to investigate what
caused the blaze.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Dan Howard said the fire
occurred ``in the main engine spaces.'' A Navy source said it
apparently involved a fuel leak in and around the ship's No. 3
boiler.
   The 581-foot White Plains is based at Guam and normally carries
403 enlisted men and 25 officers.
   The fatalities were identified as Boiler Technician 3rd Class
Muoi Cao, 22, of Ventura, Calif.; Fireman Apprentice Todd Allan
Follis, 22, of Lake Nebagamon, Wis.; Machinist Mate-Fireman
Apprentice Paul Dennis Novotny, 22, of Howells, Neb.; Fireman
Apprentice Darryl D. Edwards, 20, of Flossmor, Ill.; Boiler
Technician Baxter Lesarlley, 26, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Boiler
Technician 2nd Class Jon David Ruhmel, 20, Elmira, N.Y.
   The Navy earlier said Follis was from Zuni, N.M.
   The Navy identified the injured as Damage Controlman 2nd Class
James Henry Britt, 24, of Nashville, Tenn.; Machinist Mate 3rd
Class Keith Gerald Landry, 22, of Greenwell Springs, La.;
Boatswain's Mate 2nd Class Darryl Jerome Williams, 24, of
Birmingham, Ala.; Chief Boiler Technician Walter Rufus Greggs Jr.,
41, of Mobile, Ala.; and Boiler Technician 1st Class William Carl
Glascoe, 25, of Randolph, N.J.
   None of the victims' relatives were on hand for the ceremony.
Murki said the bodies were brought to Clark because it has a large
mortuary. He said he was uncertain when the bodies would be flown
to the United States.
   Howard and Navy spokesmen said the five injured suffered
primarily second-and third-degree burns and were airlifted to the
military hospital at Clark. Mukri said all were listed in stable
condition.

   Leftist guerrillas launched an
offensive Wednesday with attacks on military positions in 16 towns,
and at least 54 combants were killed or wounded.
   The rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said the
early morning push was aimed at showing the Front's fighting muscle
to the rightist party about to assume the presidency.
   Preliminary reports gathered from the army, rebels and civilian
sources indicated at least 34 soldiers and 20 rebels were killed or
wounded in six of the towns. Others reported no casualties.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said the drive was
called ``Everyone Against Arena in the Fight for Peace.''
   Arena is the Spanish acronym for the right-wing Republican
Nationalist Alliance. Arena President-elect Alfredo Cristiani is to
take office on June 1.
   The rebels say an Arena government will mean wider polarization
in war-torn El Salvador and a resurgence in violent repression of
political opponents.
   The rebels say the armed forces and Arena are targeting leftist
sympathizers in a campaign of searches, assassinations and arrests.
   Nidia Diaz, a commander of the Front, claimed at a news
conference in Managua, capital of neighboring Nicaragua, that
guerrillas killed or wounded 67 Salvadoran army officers and
enlisted men in all, but gave no breakdown.
   The attacks were meant to show ``the FMLN could attack various
points simultaneously and use different forces and methods of
combat,'' she said.
   She said guerrillas also blew up power lines and carried out
other acts of sabotage.
   Sources said attacks damaged at least two telecommunications
offices, two coffee-processing plants, a gasoline station, six
homes and several electricity poles and towers.
   An armed forces communique said three soldiers were killed and
seven wounded in the heaviest fighting, a four-hour clash in
Tejutepeque, 37 miles northeast of San Salvador.
   It said an intercepted rebel radio transmission indicated 20
rebels were killed or wounded in fighting Wednesday.
   The rebels fired mortars at 3rd Infantry Brigade headquarters in
San Miguel, 85 miles east of San Salvador, hitting a gasoline
storage facility, the armed forces said. About 2,800 gallons of
fuel burned.
   Mortar shells fell in open areas and no casualties or further
damage were reported, the communique said.
   Five homes were damaged when rebels directed mortar fire against
a civilian defense post in Aguilares, 20 miles north of San
Salvador, it said.
   Rebels said 13 soldiers were killed or wounded in Anamoros, 118
miles northeast of San Salvador.
   An estimated 70,000 people have been killed in the 9-year-old
war, most of them civilians.

   Housing chief Jack Kemp on Wednesday praised
anti-drug efforts now underway in public housing, but some housing
residents complained that poor management and unfair eviction
practices have turned them into victims of the nation's drug
problem.
   Citing programs developed in Trenton, N.J., Washington, D.C. and
St. Louis, Kemp praised success in ``the counter-movement'' among
tenants to wrestle control of public housing projects from drug
dealers.
   Kemp, the secretary of Housing and Urban Development, also told
the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations he is
encouraged by successful anti-drug strategies used by public
housing authorities.
   But tenants said public housing managers weren't doing enough to
fight drug trade.
   Edith Grisby, a Washington, D.C. resident, said public housing
managers should ``live in public housing'' and be present 24 hours
a day so they could take immediate action when tenants reported
drug problems.
   ``My building wouldn't need one more dime of appropriations from
you in order for it to be run correctly,'' said Charles Jenkins,
another District resident, echoing Grisby's complaints about poor
management.
   One of Kemp's first major actions was to ask public housing
administrators asking them what they were doing to combat drugs.
That query came after he witnessed drug sales while touring housing
developments in several cities.
   Last month, Kemp outlined a series of anti-drug actions _
issuance of photo tenant identification cards, installation of
security fences around projects and increased police patrols _
available to local public housing authorities.
   ``I want to be tough on drugs but I also want to be tough on due
process,'' said Kemp, emphasizing he has waived HUD administrative
grievance procedures to help speed evictions of suspected drug
dealer only in Virginia and Massachusetts.
   ``If your child is doing drugs, it is your responsibility to
deal with that situation. You don't ask the federal government to
take your child to the hospital when he or she has a broken leg,''
said Grisby, backing Kemp's actions.
   ``We don't believe we can make a strong case for eviction unless
(a person's) lease has been violated,'' said Mary Ann Russ,
executive director of public housing in Wilmington, Del.
   Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., the subcommittee's ranking
minority member whose staff investigation prompted the hearing,
noted that Congress three years ago authorized evictions for
drug-related criminal activity in public housing.
   But Herman M. Holloway Jr., a former Delaware state
representative, warned that many ``long-time tenants in good
standing'' are being hurt by hastily conceived eviction procedures.
   Meantime, rain virtually washed out a ``Save Public Housing
Day'' rally by members of the National Tenants Organization, where
about 250 people gathered at Lafayette Park across from the White
House to protest the lack of federal money for construction and
rehabilitation.

   Striking city bus employees began returning
to work Wednesday after a labor court ordered more negotiations on
wages.
   ``The service is being resumed immediately and by tomorrow most
of the buses will probably be back,'' said Rafael Cardona,
spokesman for the city administration.
   Judge Maria Esther Cervantes issued an injunction Tuesday night
on the strike and a subsequent lockout, ordering that negotiations
resume. The 23,000 bus employees went on strike May 3.
   After her ruling, union and city officials agreed to incorporate
the bus system into a new transit authority to be established
``within the next few weeks,'' Cardona said in a telephone
interview.
   Public transit in Mexico City also includes a subway, high-speed
street cars and minibuses.
   Before the walkout, the bus system carried an estimated 2
million passengers daily in 3,900 aging buses notorious for spewing
thick clouds of diesel exhaust into Mexico City's badly polluted
air. The buses were dirty, usually ran late and were playgrounds
for pickpockets.
   Millions of commuters were stranded when the bus system's
drivers, mechanics and administrative employees walked out,
demanding pay raises of 50 percent. The strike was declared
illegal, and the city said it was firing all of them.
   The city began taking strikers back on Wednesday, but whether
all 23,000 would be rehired was not clear. No date was set for the
pay negotiations.
   Bus drivers are paid about $9,000 a year, more than four times
the average wage of a public school teacher. Mayor Manuel Camacho
Solis has called them the highest-paid transit workers in Mexico.
   City officials brought 1,000 buses in from a neighboring state
during the strike and pressed hundreds of military vehicles into
service.

   A three-day general strike ordered by
leftist rebels opened Wednesday with attacks on vehicles, a
railroad bridge, and electricity towers.
   No one was reported injured in the violence, which police blamed
on the guerrillas.
   Most public agencies, private businesses and schools were closed
in this highland city, and traffic was reduced to a trickle.
   The Shining Path guerrillas ordered the strike in a three-state
area around Huancayo, about 140 miles east of Lima, by spreading
leaflets in the streets this week. They threatened violence against
anyone who did not participate.
   In Lima, the government was expected to announce Cabinet changes
soon to deal with rising rebel violence, which has left two
congressmen killed over the past two weeks.
   Police said the insurgents bombed two power pylons and caused a
blackout in the Huancayo area before dawn. They also exploded
several bombs across this city of 100,000, authorities said.
   Insurgents blew up a railroad bridge 12 miles to the north,
officials said.
   Police said rebels confronted four buses and seven trucks,
ordering out passengers and drivers and setting the vehicles on
fire.
   Rebels began such strikes about a year ago to foment economic
chaos.
   Their nine-year-long insurgency aims at imposing Marxist rule in
Peru. More than 14,000 people have died in the fighting, including
about 1,000 this year.

<HEAD>Former Chancellor To Be Charged With Perjury</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Chancellor Fred Sinowatz will be
charged with perjury in connection with testimony in a 1987 trial
that arose from a probe into President Kurt Waldheim's World War II
past, the justice minister said Wednesday.
   Justice Minister Egmont Foregger did not specify which
statements by Sinowatz were thought to be false.
   In October 1987, Sinowatz lost a libel suit against a journalist
who quoted Sinowatz as telling fellow politicians two years earlier
that Austria would become aware of Waldheim's past.
   Waldheim's controversial background as a German army lieutenant
in World War II was first publicly disclosed in March 1986 in
reports by The New York Times, the Austrian weekly Profil and the
World Jewish Congress.
   The question of who released the documents on Waldheim's past
has never been answered.
   Waldheim won over a candidate from Sinowatz's Socialist Party in
the 1986 presidential election, which was marked by fierce
controversy over Waldheim's past.
   At the 1987 trial, Sinowatz denied under oath a report by
journalist Alfred Worm that he said in late 1985 Austria would soon
learn of Waldheim's past.
   Sinowatz resigned as chancellor a day after Waldheim was elected
president in June 1986.
   Waldheim denies he was involved in Nazi war crimes during his
service in the Balkans, as media reports alleged.
   An international commission of historians appointed to probe
Waldheim's past concluded in February 1988 it had no evidence he
was involved in war crimes, but said Waldheim concealed his past
and was in close proximity to Nazi crimes when in the Balkans.

   The Bush administration on Wednesday accused
Panama's leader Manuel Antonio Noriega of ``blatant attempts at
intimidation'' and of responsibility for violence against
opposition leaders but wouldn't say how the United States might
respond.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush
``condemned the violence now under way in Panama,'' including an
attack on opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara.
   Fitzwater said Noriega thwarted the desire of the people of
Panama for democracy ``by conducting a fraudulent election. ... He
has now escalated this to include violence against opposition
leaders, including Mr. Endara.''
   Endara was injured when police broke up an opposition
demonstration Wednesday.
   Fitzwater said Bush tried to call Endara in the hospital, where
he appeared before reporters in a wheelchair, but could not reach
him.
   Bush received a first-hand account on the deteriorating
situation in Panama from the U.S. ambassador there in a late
afternoon phone call, Fitzwater said.
   He said ``reported harassment of U.S. servicemen'' was one of
the topics of discussion.
   ``The president also contacted the leadership of other countries
with interests in the region,'' Fitzwater said. ``Those
conversations related to Latin American unity in facing the blatant
attempts at intimidation now being conducted by the Noriega
regime.''
   ``This action underscores that General Noriega does not have the
interests of the Panamanian people at heart,'' Fitzwater said.
   He declined to say how the United States might respond.
   Bush discussed the situation at the White House in a hastily
called afternoon meeting of his national security advisers.
   A senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified by
name, told reporters the administration didn't want to signal what
actions might be taken or when. As for possible military action or
increasing U.S. forces in Panama, the official said he wouldn't
comment on any military actions but that U.S. forces would be
prepared to take whatever action might be necessary.
   Meanwhile, the U.S. military's Southern Command, responding to
reports of violence in Panama City, upgraded an alert to a level
meaning servicemen and their families should ``limit all movement
... should not go into public areas in Panama except for essential
business.''
   No other special precautions or troop movements have been
ordered, Pentagon officials said.
   In Panama, Panamanian defense forces detained three American
army soldiers for three hours because they were taking pictures in
the vicinity of a car carrying Noriega, said Mercedes Morris, a
spokeswoman for the Southern Command.
   In a separate incident, two U.S. military attaches, both Army
majors, were detained by Panamanian defense forces during an
opposition demonstration, according to a U.S. official who declined
to be identified.
   Earlier, U.S. officials said it was important that the United
States make a ``credible demonstration'' of U.S. resolve following
Sunday's national election, which Bush contended was marked by
``massive irregularities.''
   But there were significant drawbacks to virtually all the
proposals designed to bring about quick results, according to the
officials, who asked not to be identified.
   Significant military action or abrogation of the canal treaties
seemed out of the question, the officials said, because such
actions could touch off a wave of anti-Americanism throughout the
hemisphere and encourage sabotage against the Panama Canal.
   In addition, either could lead to retaliatory action against
some of the 50,000 Americans living in Panama.
   Imposing a trade embargo has major drawbacks, the officials
said, because this could deal a devastating blow to the extensive
U.S. business interests in Panama.
   One alternative apparently not ruled out was a legal effort to
seize Noriega's foreign assets, believed to total in the hundreds
of millions of dollars.
   For the third day in a row, the administration accused Noriega
of orchestrating the results in favor of his handpicked candidate,
Carlos Duque.
   ``Having failed to rig the election in advance, Noriega is now
doing everything he can to steal it after the fact despite the
clear message from the people of Panama,'' State Department deputy
spokesman Richard Boucher said.
   In answer to a question during an appearance in Philadelphia,
Vice President Dan Quayle declined to discuss what steps the
administration might take.
   ``The president has all the options,'' he said. ``I'm not going
into that. The people of Panama have spoken. Noriega ought to
accept the view of the people. We should be patient while the
president considers the course to take.''
   ``There was no support for Noriega from any segment of the
Panamanian population. He must go,'' Quayle said.
   Peter Rodman, a National Security Council aide, told a gathering
in Washington that he believes there is reason for hope in Panama.
   ``I am encourged by the fact that a major event has just taken
place, and I am not sure it is so easy for Noriega to contain it,''
Rodman said. ``In the end, maybe he will contain it, but I think an
unmanageable problem has been created.''
   With a few exceptions, much of the rest of the hemisphere seemed
content to await future developments in Panama before taking a
stand on the election process.
   At the Organization of American States, U.S. delegate William T.
Pryce called on OAS nations Wednesday to add their voice to the
``international outcry against the Noriega regime'' and what he
described as its efforts to oppose the will of the Panamanian
people.
   The delegates from Peru and El Salvador criticized Panama but,
as one U.S. official put it, ``there was a lot of temporizing'' by
other representatives.
   Mexico, in particular, sees national elections as an internal
matter which should not be the subject of international criticism.
   A number of countries will be holding elections over the next
year in Latin America and some delegates believe silence on the
Panamanian election now could spare their governments criticism if
their election processes do not go smoothly, the official said.

   Six right-to-life senators signed a letter to
President Bush on Wednesday expressing their continued opposition
to Health Secretary Louis Sullivan's choice of an Oklahoma state
official for a top agency job.
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who drafted the letter, said a
meeting last week attended by a half dozen senators, Sullivan and
his candidate, Robert Fulton, did little to allay his concerns that
Fulton does not share their right-to-life views on matters
involving handicapped infants.
   ``It would be just inappropriate for Mr. Fulton to serve in a
high position at HHS,'' Humphrey said in an interview Tuesday.
   He declined to release the letter, but his spokesman said that
in addition to Humphrey, it was signed by Sens. William Armstrong,
R-Colo.; Dan Coats, R-Ind.; Phil Gramm, R-Texas; Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.; and Steve Symms, R-Idaho.
   When informed of the letter, Fulton said: ``I'm disappointed I
haven't been able to reassure them and I'm still very interested in
the job and hope I can be endorsed by the president.''
   Sullivan has been pushing the White House to name the Oklahoma
secretary of social services as head of the Family Services
Administration at HHS, which manages the government's major welfare
programs.
   Fulton, however, is opposed by right-to-life groups who
criticise him for failing to act when, as director of the state
human services department, he became aware of an alleged state
hospital policy to withhold life-saving care from babies with the
crippling deformity spina bifida. Before Fulton became director, 24
spina bifida babies denied surgery at the hospital died in a
five-year period ending in 1983.
   Fulton fends off the criticism by saying that shortly after he
took office and became aware of the deaths, he put into effect new
federal regulations requiring medical treatment for all infants,
unless the treatment would be futile or would shorten the baby's
life.
   He said that while he served in the top two health offices in
Oklahoma, only one spina bifida infant died and that child died of
complications from multiple birth defects.
   Sullivan ran afoul of right-to-life advocates after he was
nominated for the HHS job when twice he reportedly made pro-choice
comments about abortion. Each time he responded to pro-life critics
by saying he shared President Bush's opposition to abortion.
   Fulton has been actively supported for the HHS post by Oklahoma
Gov. Henry Bellmon, said White House personnel chief Chase
Untermeyer.
   But Untermeyer said that no decision has been made. While Fulton
remains a candidate, he said, ``on something this controversial
we'd be looking at a broad range of candidates.''

   Coal miner Steve Hamilton did something
Wednesday that most other workers only dream about: He confronted
the chairman of his company and told him why he's out on strike.
   Paul W. Douglas, chairman and chief executive officer of The
Pittson Co., listened patiently as Hamilton addressed shareholders
at the company's annual meeting before responding in a calm voice.
   ``The human needs and values of our employees are very much on
our minds,'' Douglas said. He said Pittston needs concessions from
1,700 striking miners in Virginia and West Virgina so Pittston can
modernize and become more flexible.
   Hamilton, a 27-year-old heavy equipment operator from
Castlewood, Va., refused to accept the explanation.
   ``You want us to say we will work seven days a week. We can't go
to church because we have to observe our jobs,'' he said. ``There
are several issues that you are trying to sugarcoat. It's a whole
lot more than you're willing to say.''
   Douglas shrugged off the criticism, saying, ``It's a question of
proper communication.''
   The dialogue ended in a standoff, but both sides later claimed
victory on three proxy issues submitted to the shareholders by the
United Mine Workers and opposed by management.
   Hamilton was one of a few miners and union leaders allowed to
attend the annual meeting in a cramped, third-floor lunchroom at
Pittston headquarters. The session lasted more than three hours as
labor and mangement argued about Pittston's corporate goals as well
as strike issues.
   About 200 other miners and their supporters rallied outside the
building despite a steady downpour. The rally was noisy and the
voices of the chanting crowd could be heard during the annual
meeting, but no arrests were made.
   Violence has marked the strike since it began April 5. More than
1,300 coal miners and their spouses have been arrested in Virginia
and West Virginia since the walkout began, with 140 of those people
charged with felonies.
   The union's main effort was concentrated on the meeting, where
leaders pushed for the acceptance of three proposals questioning
the operation of Pittston. The national union and UMW Local 950
through their Pittston Independent Shareholders Committeee own
1,721 shares of Pittston stock, enabling the miners to include
items on the proxy ballot.
   Kenneth Zinn, the union's director of special projects, said a
goal of the three proxy issues was to return the company to ``good
corporate governance.''
   Douglas told shareholders the proposals were nothing more than
an attempt by the union to enhance its contract negotiations.
   The first proposal asked that shareholders be allowed to vote on
the anti-takeover or ``poison pill'' measures adopted by
management. The second proposal called for secret ballots during
annual meetings, and the third asked to establish a committee to
study the possible sale of subsidiaries.
   Union leaders said after the meeting that the vote was close,
but they believed they had won a majority of the company's 38
million shares. Douglas agreed that the vote was close, but said
``no'' votes would tally just over 50 percent on the first
proposal, well over 50 percent on the second and 80 percent on the
final proposal.
   The results of the vote won't be known until June 12, when
auditors are to report at a special meeting.

   Thousands of journalists, entertainers, and
cameramen at the British Broadcasting Corp. stayed off the job for
the second day Wednesday, forcing curtailment or cancellation of
newscasts and other live programs.
   The corporation said 12,000 of its 25,000 workers stayed home on
the second day of the 48-hour walkout. BBC management said it hoped
conditions would return to normal Thursday.
   All radio and television news programs were cut short.
   A live talk show hosted by popular Terry Wogan was replaced with
a repeat of an interview with ``Dynasty'' star Joan Collins.
   Late-night live pop shows were replaced by pre-recorded material.
   It was the second time in three months the unions have struck
for better pay.
   They want raises of 16 percent to match salaries in commercial
broadcasting. The BBC, which is funded by public fees, has offered
7 percent.
   The unions say the national average pay for a BBC journalist is
$28,390 a year, compared with $40,080 in commercial broadcasting.

   A charge that bluegrass music star Bill
Monroe hit a woman in the face with a Bible was dismissed Wednesday
after prosecutors said she was a fan who'd harassed him for four
years.
   Wanda Huff, 51, obtained the misdemeanor assault and battery
warrant May 1, saying Monroe struck her with the book after she
asked him to swear on it that he wasn't seeing other women.
   After the incident at Monroe's farm in Goodlettsvile northwest
of Nashville, Mrs. Huff said she was the 77-year-old Grand Ole Opry
star's girlfriend, but prosecutors said she was just a fan.
   Mrs. Huff denied making harassing phone calls.
   ``I know this warrant has been an embarrassment to you,'' Sumner
County General Sessions Judge Jane Wheatcraft told Monroe.
   ``I'm so happy,'' the gray-haired Grammy Award winner said
outside the courtroom. ``It's been difficult with people bothering
me. I'm glad it's over.''
   When Mrs. Huff arrived Wednesday for the hearing, Sumner County
Sheriff Richard Sutton confiscated a loaded .25-caliber pistol from
her pickup truck.
   Monroe lawyer Bob Ingrum said he requested the search because
Mrs. Huff said several times she had received word someone waited
to kill Monroe.
   Prosecutors recommended the charge be dropped after talking to
several witnesses who said Mrs. Huff, often using aliases, called
Monroe's home and office up to 15 times a day.
   Before the May 1 incident that led to the charge, Mrs. Huff
called the farm to warn workers she was coming to see Monroe to
retrieve some gifts she gave him, Assistant District Attorney Dee
Gay said.
   Ingrum said Mrs. Huff wanted to take back some blue jeans, a tie
tack, a hatband and $27 for garden seeds she had given Monroe.
   ``She threw the britches in the yard, the hatband in the mule
yard and the $27 in Mr. Monroe's face,'' Ingrum said. ``We never
did find the tie tack, and she threw her glasses on top of the
roof.''
   Monroe called Goodlettsville police to throw Mrs. Huff off his
farm, Gay said. She asked them to arrest Monroe, but they refused
to file charges against him.
   Mrs. Huff went to a magistrate, who issued the assault warrant.
Monroe was arrested May 2, and released on $500 bond.
   Ingrum obtained a temporary restraining order Wednesday
instructing Mrs. Huff to stay away from Monroe. Mrs. Huff agreed to
comply, Gay said.
   Grand Ole Opry security officer James Lewis said the harassing
phone calls began in later 1984 or early 1985 when Mrs. Huff called
him at the Opry and said she had gotten a call from someone who
threatened Monroe's life.
   Lewis said he talked with Mrs. Huff five or six times since, and
each time she mentioned death threats.
   Monroe, best known for the song ``Blue Moon of Kentucky,'' said
he didn't like publicity about the incident, ``but my good friends
and fans know it was wrong.''
   A tearful Mrs. Huff denied making the harassing phone calls.
   ``You can pay people to tell all kind of lies,'' she said as she
left the parking lot.
   ``I've been deceived. I've been betrayed. I got beat up,'' she
said. ``I did not threaten to kill him. If I wanted to, I could
have when we were alone.''

   The sniper who fired an assault rifle into
downtown Boston from a small airplane thwarted five different law
enforcement agencies with instant communications, state-of-the-art
helicopters and sophisticated radar.
   Murder suspect Alfred Hunter was captured early Wednesday when
he landed a stolen plane at Logan International Airport after a
three-hour flight, just five minutes before the Cessna would have
run out of fuel.
   Jet helicopters owned by state police could easily have
overtaken the Cessna, if officials had decided to use them, said
Trooper David F. Morrill.
   ``Why risk a helicopter chasing an armed person in an
airplane?'' Morrill asked. ``All a helicopter is going to be able
to do is follow him. We did that anyway with the radar. If you get
up there and engage in a shooting match, all you do is endanger
other people.''
   State police, the Federal Aviation Administration, the
Massachusetts Port Authority which operates Logan Airport,
emergency response crews and three local police departments were
responded to Hunter's three-hour escapade.
   Airports all over Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire were
alerted.
   Like the feat of Mathias Rust, the 19-year-old West German who
flew through elaborate Soviet border security in a single-engine
Cessna and buzzed Red Square before landing there, Hunter's buzzing
the control tower at Logan Airport and swooping under the Tobin
Bridge stunned law enforcement officials.
   Longtime law enforcment officials said they had never seen
anything like it.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' said Logan Airport spokesman Phil Orlandella. ``We
could only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   ``What if you shoot the guy down and he crashes into a house or
something?'' said Morrill, noting that for much of the time Hunter
was flying low over heavily populated areas. ``It just isn't
feasible. You basically have to hope he runs out of fuel.''
   FAA officials tracking Hunter from Logan's control tower twice
had to scramble out of their perch because the Cessna came so close
they feared it would crash into the tower.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, an FAA spokesman in Washington.

   Fire killed about 500,000 laboratory
mice and injured five people Wednesday in a blaze at a genetic
research center that one lab official said would set back
scientific research worldwide.
   Four construction workers and a firefighter were injured in the
midday fire at Jackson Laboratory, the world's leading nonprofit
supplier of genetically identical mice used in research on cancer,
AIDS, diabetes and other human diseases.
   The lab's director-designee, Kenneth Paigen, said the fire would
not retard the Jackson Laboratory's research because mice used in
its own experiments already had been transferred to the research
building.
   ``What it will set back is the research efforts of scientists
all over the world'' who depend on the lab for specially bred mice,
he said.
   ``We managed to save what are called the foundation stocks ...
the original genetically defined strains,'' Paigen said. ``It will
take us time but we will be able to reproduce what was there.''
   The fire broke out about 1:15 p.m. in the one-story, brick-faced
Morrell Park building where the mice are bred and housed, in a room
that was undergoing renovation, fire officials said.
   Bar Harbor Fire Chief Royal Higgins said a sealant being used by
the construction workers apparently acted as an accelerant in the
fire, but ``what ignited it, I don't know.''
   He said several propane tanks had exploded, but he was not
suggesting that it caused the fire.
   Most of the mice were earmarked for shipment to researchers
throughout the world, said Barbara Trevett, the laboratory's
spokeswoman. She said the building was destroyed, along with the
mice housed in its 18 storage rooms.
   The facility stocks 1,700 different strains of mice, some of
which are produced only at the Jackson Lab.
   Each year, the laboratory ships about 3 million mice to
scientists around the world. Sales of the mice generate $10 million
a year, which is plowed back into research and other programs at
the laboratory, Trevett said.
   She said the lab's the major customers include the National
Institutes of Health, Harvard, MIT and other universities doing
research on mammalian genetics, and major hospitals with research
centers.
   Lab officials said about 230 employees worked in, or in
connection with, the animal production building. The campus-like
laboratory complex beside Acadia National Park employs more than
500 people.
   One injured construction worker was transferred in stable
condition to Maine Medical Center's burn unit in Portland, but the
extent of his injuries was unknown, officials said.
   Jeanne Dulong, director of nursing at Mount Desert Island
Hospital said three other workers were admitted with non-extensive
first-and second-degree burns and would probably be released in a
day or two.
   The firefighter, whose name Ms. Dulong could not release, was
being treated for minor smoke inhalation and would probably be
quickly released, she said.
   In 1947, a forest fire that swept across Mount Desert Island,
destroying the laboratory that was founded 18 years earlier with
financing from wealthy summer residents. Rebuilt after the fire,
the lab grew rapidly to become the world's largest center for the
study of mammalian genetics.
   Earl Green, a former director of the laboratory, said it would
take six to eight generations of mice, or about two or three years,
to replace the destroyed animals.

<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grain elevator besieged by a
demolition crew is making one of the most stubborn last stands
since the Alamo, but some say the problem isn't tough concrete.
It's a curse.
   People who've climbed secretly to the top of the 110-foot-high
silos and looked across a moonlit Fort Worth say the curse has
struck a number of times, including the fatal stabbing last year of
a Japanese tourist.
   ``They've found several dead dogs and cats by it,'' said Charles
Shields, 25, who works near the 1902 structure just west of
downtown.
   ``I don't believe in curses,'' said Jerry Vann, whose Chicago
demolition company has spent 39 days trying to knock the elevator
down with more than 500 dynamite blasts. ``All I know is it's
costing me money.''
   Vann took the job for a flat fee, expecting to finish the job in
eight or nine days. So far, he's $9,000 in the hole and expects to
stay at least through Saturday _ at a cost of $1,000 or so a day.
   ``I've got my reputation,'' he said. ``I've knocked down
buildings worldwide. But this is like nothing I've ever seen.''
   Twenty-two of the 17-foot-wide silos are gone, but 23 remain,
lined three deep in a honeycomb pattern. Alongside the remaining
silos is the 190-foot-tall main building.
   Among those working for Vann is Tony Cruson, 37, who grew up in
Fort Worth and heard rumors the elevator was haunted.
   ``Around Halloween, the big deal for boys was to bring girls out
here, and try to get in good with them by protecting them,'' he
said.
   James Ferrar, 33, who has climbed the tower secretly a number of
times, said he believes it's haunted and has heard chilling screams
several times.
   One of his friends, making a night climb by lantern light in the
late 1970s, fell and broke both arms, he said. Cruson and others
have heard the story.
   The unidentified man told others he was climbing a circular
staircase in the main building, reached the top, but then the
staircase seemed to extend itself. As he kept climbing, someone
from above reached out and pushed him, Ferrar said.
   ``For 30 years, I wanted to go up and see the top of this
silo,'' Cruson said. ``But when you get up there, the wind whistles
through it and you hear all kinds of noises. It's eerie, really
eerie.''
   Fort Worth police homicide Lt. Tommy Swan said the only
real-life horror he can associate with the elevator is the stabbing
of Japanese tourist Fumika Okada, who was lured to her death.
   ``I grew up in Fort Worth and I never heard about anything
satanic about that place,'' Swan said. ``But of course, I never
heard about marijuana until I was 21, either, and that doesn't mean
it wasn't there.''
   Developer James Toal, who hopes to build an office and
residential complex on the site, along with a major hotel, said
he'd never heard the elevator was haunted. ``There's people killed
all over the place,'' he pointed out.
   Toal says there are plenty of rumors flying as the silos make
their last stand. But one rumor workmen say they can't discuss in
detail is true. A local production crew is making a movie at the
site, the story of an entity trapped in the elevator as it is being
destroyed.
   The title? ``Incantations.''

<TEXT>
   An engineer inspired by the flight of
hummingbirds hovered 40 feet in the air Wednesday in a saucer-like
craft he said will revolutionize commuter travel.
   Paul Moller said his brief, noisy flight over a crowd of
wind-blown reporters was to demonstrate the technology his company
is developing to build a flying car for the 21st century.
   ``At some point in time, it will be used for that,'' Moller
said. ``You know the automobile is still good for that short
distance, but here to San Francisco, here to Reno, here to L.A.,
you're going to see something like this will be in common usage.
   ``It's going to take off very rapidly once the credibility is
established.''
   A former professor and founder of the aeronautics program at the
University of California, Davis, Moller has spent nearly 30 years
developing what's known in the field as a ``vertical take-off and
landing'' or VTOL aircraft.
   His company, Moller International, in a Davis research park
about 80 miles northeast of San Francisco, is working on robotic
aircraft for reconnaissance use by the military, as well as
commuter vehicles.
   Moller, 51, calls his machines ``volantors,'' referring to
quick, nimble flight like that of the hummingbird that awed him
since he was a 6-year-old child.
   The 10-foot wide, round, blue craft he flew Wednesday, the
M200x, hung in the air for about three minutes and made a slow spin
before landing in virtually the same spot where it took off.
   But its visual grace was accompanied with the deafening roar of
eight unmuffled snowmobile engines and a vortex of wind that pushed
it off the ground, slashed the grass below and tumbled camera bags
and the contents of a purse across the lawn.
   Moller wore a fire-retardant racing suit and a motorcycle
helmet. His machine was tethered by a thin cable to a construction
crane for insurance and safety reasons. But once unleashed, he
said, it would go ``as high as I'm willing to let it go.''
   While the M200x looks like a vehicle for George Jetson of
cartoon fame, a another model that Moller said his company will
produce and begin testing later this year is fit for James Bond.
Sleek and bubble-topped, it looks like a cross between a jet
fighter and the Batmobile.
   Moller said his M400 will be able to carry four passengers at
speeds up to 403 mph, as high as 31,000 feet and as far as 850
miles before refueling on low-octane gasoline. At a cruising speed
of 220 mph, he said, its fuel efficiency would be about 15 miles
per gallon.
   Like the saucer craft, the M400 will be powered by eight
gasoline rotary engines built with technology acquired from a
company that used them in snowmobiles. Mollar said he chose rotary
engines for their power, light weight and relatively low cost.
   The engines power fans that drive air down for takeoff and
hovering, then a series of vanes and ducts redirect thrust for
horizontal flight. Computers and gyroscopes control the vehicles'
pitch and roll.
   Moller said the M400 could be ready for sale to the public
within five to 10 years. He estimated the price for initial
hand-built models would be about the same as a helicopter or
airplane, then would drop to $20,000 or $30,000 once mass produced.
   Jack Allison, the company's marketing director, said on-board
computers could navigate the crafts using satellites to determine
their location and avoid collisions.
   ``Eventually we'll have electronic highways in the sky created
so that this type of vehicle can carry commuters in substantial
numbers and do so without any danger whatsoever to commercial
aviation and other general aviation,'' Allison said.

<TEXT>
   Nine states have reached a $315,000
settlement with Campbell Soup Co., which agreed to change certain
health-related advertising practices, the Wisconsin attorney
general said Wednesday.
   Don Hanaway said the attorneys general of the states contended
that Campbell's ads made high fiber claims about certain soup
products which were not high in fiber, calcium source claims about
soups which alone are not a good source of calcium, and ``generally
mischaracterized the health effects of Campbell's soup products.''
   For example, Hanaway said, ``Campbell misrepresented the calcium
content of its tomato, cream of mushroom and cream of celery soups
by claiming in its advertisements that one serving of these soups
provides `10 percent of your daily requirement,' when in fact, the
calcium is not in the soup but in the milk that the soup can
optionally be prepared with.''
   Hanaway said Campbell ``also falsely implied that its bean and
pea soups can prevent `some kinds of cancer' by not sufficiently
stressing in the advertisements that only a diet high in fiber and
low in fat has been proven to help reduce colorectal cancer and not
other types of cancer.''
   Campbell issued a statement saying it was not admitting
wrongdoing in reaching the agreement on the ads, which have not
appeared since early 1988.
   The company said it chose not to fight the matter in court
because of what it described as peripheral nature of the dispute
and because of the drain on Campbell resources that would result
from pursuing the matter in each of the nine states.
   Wisconsin worked with attorneys general of California, Illinois,
Iowa, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York and Texas in
reaching the settlement, Hanaway said.
   Hanaway said the agreement requires Campbell, of Camden, N.J.,
to pay each state $35,000 in costs.
   The agreement does not affect a complaint filed against Campbell
in January by the Federal Trade Commission, which accused the
company of overstating the health benefits of its chicken noodle
soup.
   Campbell advertisments misled consumers by failing to alert them
of the soup's sodium content, the federal agency charged.
   Campbell halted the advertising campaign challenged by the nine
states a year ago, but Campbell spokesman James H. Moran said the
company plans to fight the FTC complaint.
   ``We're standing by the ad and we're going to court and prove
our case,'' said Moran.
   Campbell, which sells about 5 billion cans of soup a year,
garnering about 65 percent of the $2.2 billion retail soup market
in the United States, has come under heavy criticism from the
Center for Science in the Public Interest.
   Since 1983, the Washington-based consumer interest group has
twice asked the FTC to review Campbell's advertising and sodium
content claims.
   ``The amount of sodium and salt in the soups is a serious
concern,'' said Charles Mitchell, a staff attorney for Science in
the Public Interest. ``Most of their soups are so high in sodium
that the increased risk of high blood pressure from the soups might
outweigh any other positive benefits that are or are not in the
soups.''

<TEXT>
   The pro-government teachers union and its
dissident wing reached an agreement on wages and union corruption
Wednesday night, ending a 3-week-old strike.
   The National Education Workers' Federation agreed with the
dissident Democratic Coordinate to accept a government offer of a
25 percent increase in wages and benefits and to adopt
anti-corruption measures inside the union, a union official said on
condition of anonymity.
   About 8,000 teachers voted Wednesday night and approved the
agreement overwhelmingly, the official said. He did not have a vote
count and did not say why so few voted.
   ``There is agreement between both factions to end the strike,''
the official said. ``Classes will be open tomorrow (Thursday).''
   The Education Department also said it would replace the
superintendents in all 14 of the nation's districts. It said the
move was designed to increase efficiency, but gave no details.
   The Democratic Coordinate, which claims the loyalty of about
half the federation's 1.1 million members, struck April 17 to
demand a 100 percent increase in pay and democratic reforms within
the union.
   The strike closed roughly half of the nation's grammar and high
schools, and vocational institutes.
   The teachers, whose take-home pay averaged $147 a month,
rejected a first government offer of a 15 percent increase. The
government later raised it to 25 percent effective May 15.
   The strike also led to the ouster of Carlos Jonguitud Barrios,
an old-style machine politician close to the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party.
   Jonguitud and a group of corrupt cronies had controlled the
union for 17 years.
   Union dissidents accused Jonguitud of mismanaging union funds
and keeping his group in power by forbidding rank-and-file
assemblies and rigging union elections.
   Jonguitud's replacement by Elba Esther Gordillo, a moderate
loyal to the ruling party, removed a major stumbling block in the
negotiations between the two sides. Coordinate leader Teodoro
Palomino refused to talk with Jonguitud but said he could deal with
Gordillo.
   The two sides also agreed to set up a bilateral commission to
negotiate wage increases for about 300,000 school janitors and
non-teaching staff by July 15.

   A couple suspected of killing their
6-week-old daughter buried her Wednesday beside the unmarked grave
containing remains of what is believed to be their slain firstborn.
   Robert and Paula Sims were joined by more than a dozen family
members at a private, 30-minute service for Heather Lee Sims at the
First Baptist Church in Bethalto. The infant was buried nearby in
Woodland Hills Cemetery.
   The Simses reported both of their baby girls kidnapped in nearly
identical incidents three years apart. The parents are considered
suspects in both deaths, but their lawyer has said they are
innocent of wrongdoing in the cases.
   The Simses, who had not publicly displayed any emotion toward
each other since they reported Heather abducted April 29, held
hands as they walked into the church. Mrs. Sims, 29, appeared
tearful as she left the church.
   During the 10-minute graveside ceremony Sims, 37, placed his
right arm around Mrs. Sims. Onlookers were kept about 50 yards away.
   The funeral party included Mrs. Simses' parents, Orville and
Nylene Blew. Police have also subpoenaed the Blews to testify
before a grand jury in Heather's slaying.
   Heather was buried in a tiny white coffin. An employee of the
Gray Funeral Home in Wood River was the sole pallbearer.
   The Simses requested that Heather be buried at the side of their
firstborn daughter, Loralei, said Bill Helvie, cemetery manager.
   Loralei Sims was 13 days old when the Simses reported her
kidnapped June 17, 1986. Remains believed to be Loralei's were
found near the Simses' former home in nearby Brighton aout a week
after she vanished.
   The case was never solved, though the Simses were considered
suspects in Loralei's disappearance.
   In the latest case, the Simses told police that a masked gunman
attacked Mrs. Sims about 10:30 p.m. April 29 as she took out the
garbage, and that she presumed he had taken Heather.
   On May 3, a fisherman found the child's body in a trash barrel
in Missouri, across the Mississippi River from Alton.
   Heather was suffocated by someone who placed a hand over her
mouth, according to police, who said her body was placed in a
freezer before it was left in the trash barrel.
   An autopsy revealed cuts inside the baby's upper lip, Alton
police Sgt. RickMcCain testified Tuesday at a hearing where the
Simses' were denied custody of their surviving child, 15-month-old
Randy.
   The Alton Police Department reported no arrests in the case
Wednesday.
   The Simses have refused to comment on the case, but their
lawyer, Donald Groshong has said they are innocent.
   Mrs. Sims was expected to appear before a Madison County grand
jury investigating the case Thursday.

   A distraught man who allegedly had just killed his
ex-wife commandeered a small plane and held the city hostage for
three hours early Wednesday, firing a semiautomatic weapon while
flying within 50 feet of motorists and buildings.
   ``We could do nothing but wait and try to guess where he was
going to land,'' airport spokesman Phil Orlandella said. ``We could
only have made things worse by going up and chasing him.''
   Traffic controllers at Logan International Airport said the
pilot buzzed them repeatedly, forcing officials to close the
airport for an hour and reroute several late-night flights.
Controllers fled the tower twice.
   ``We have a very thick handbook on the rules of air traffic
control, but there's nothing in there about what to do if a maniac
comes shooting an AK-47 at you in the control tower,'' said John
Leyden, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in
Washington.
   ``We didn't know if he was on drugs ... drunk, or if he was
suicidal,'' said Orlandella of the Massachusetts Port Authority,
which operates Logan. ``We had not one word of radio contact
throughout the whole flight.''
   Alfred J. Hunter, 42, pleaded innocent Wednesday in Salem to one
count each of murder and armed robbery after a midnight flight that
reportedly included a dip beneath a harbor bridge. Essex County
District Judge John T. Doyle ordered Hunter held without bail at
Bridgewater State Hospital for 20 days of psychiatric observation.
   Hunter made no comments when he was captured, police said.
   Bullets struck a variety of targets, including parked cars and
the Prudential tower's 50th-floor skywalk.
   One pedestrian was struck by ejected casings from the spent
rounds.
   FAA Field Manager Richard Fontz said Hunter was not a licensed
pilot but had apparently had some instruction from his father.
   ``It obviously wasn't the first time he flew an airplane,''
Fontz said.
   Hunter also repeatedly buzzed the post office where he worked,
Fontz said. ``The diving he was doing among the buildings and under
the bridge was something.''
   The sniper flight began at 10:20 p.m. Tuesday and for the next
three hours ambulance services tried to anticipate where the pilot
might land so they could prepare for possible injuries.
   Police in Boston received more than 200 calls from people
reporting the sound of gunfire. In suburban Lynn, police said two
cars were hit by a shower of shots believed fired from the
zig-zagging plane.
   Andrew Smith said he was walking along fashionable Newbury
Street in the city's Back Bay section when he heard popping noises
from the sky.
   ``About two seconds later, several shell casings landed all
around. At that point I realized that the guy was shooting out of
his plane,'' said Smith, who notified police. ``Nobody believed me
at first. I didn't believe it at first,''
   Trooper Barbara Bennett said officials decided to wait until the
gunman ran out of fuel rather than send up a state police
helicopter. If the plane had been shot at, she said, it could have
endangered the public.
   Hunter landed briefly at Logan at 12:57 a.m. but took off again.
He landed again 17 minutes later and was captured after a minor
scuffle, Bennett said.
   Two shell casings and two live shells were found in the
two-seater Cessna, which had about five minutes of fuel left.
Police found no weapon and said it probably was discarded during
the flight. They also said there was no way to tell how many shots
were fired.
   The ammunition was like that used in a semiautomatic assault
rifle such as an AK-47, said State Police Cpl. Joseph Howley. He
said it would not be possible to determine te type of weapon used
from the ammunition alone.
   Earlier Tuesday, Hunter, a mail handler, was given one year's
probation for assaulting his 26-year-old ex-wife, Elvira, in
December 1988 in an argument triggered when he ordered her not to
change a television channel.
   Hunter was convicted of assault and battery, making threats and
violating a restraining order his wife sought in January 1988. The
couple divorced in May 1988.
   Hunter's only previous criminal conviction stemmed from a 1979
incident in which he pleaded guilty to assaulting a group of people
with a machete. He told the court they tried to rob him, and was
sentenced to a year's probation.
   Police said they believe that on Tuesday night Hunter went to
his ex-wife's home and shot her in front of their 5-year-old son
before launching his aerial attack.
   Hunter then commandeered a car, and demanded and got a plane at
the small municipal airport straddling the Beverly-Danvers border
about 20 miles north of Boston.
   ``(It) was the last thing I was expecting. I was basically in
shock,'' said Robert Golder, 21, a flight instructor. ``He wanted
me to start the airplane for him. He told me not to do anything
stupid. He said he had just killed some people.''

   Thousands of students bicycled to major media and
government offices today to protest censorship, and officials
announced their first policy change in response to demands made in
nearly a month of pro-democracy protests.
   The Ministry of Supervision said today that it would allow more
open news reporting of corruption cases, saying the move was
``prompted by the recent demands of Beijing university students to
crack down on corruption.''
   Today's protest by more than 5,000 students came a day after a
petition signed by more than 1,000 Chinese journalists seeking
press freedom in this Communist nation was delivered to government
officials.
   ``We're riding bicycles today because we're too tired to walk,''
said a history student who was a veteran of four recent protest
marches along the 10-mile route from the nation's top schools to
Tiananmen Square downtown.

   U.S. automakers say they're working all out to
eliminate an ozone-destroying coolant from car air conditioners,
and a Vermont ban on the substance won't help.
   ``All they're really doing is hindering our progress from a
longer-term point of view,'' says Norm Nielsen, supervisor of
government regulatory programs at Chrysler Corp.
   ``The last thing we need is having separate standards in
states.''
   Vermont's Legislature last week enacted a bill to outlaw the
registration of cars with air conditioners using
chlorofluorocarbons beginning with the 1993 model year. Gov.
Madeleine Kunin has hailed the bill and is expected to sign it
within two weeks.

   Pablo Picasso would have gotten a kick out of
seeing his self-portrait sell for $47.85 million to become the
second most expensive art work ever auctioned, his daughter said.
   ``Yo Picasso,'' painted 88 years ago when the artist was 20, was
last sold in 1981 for $5.5 million.
   Its price Tuesday night at Sotheby's was more than twice its
pre-sale estimate and was second only to Vincent Van Gogh's
``Irises,'' which sold for $53.9 million in 1987.
   The Picasso was one of 67 Impressionist, Post-Impressionist and
Modern works that sold for a record total of $204.82 million. The
previous mark for one auction was $117 million at Sotheby's in
London in April.
   Paloma Picasso, who attended Tuesday's sale, said she thought
her father ``would get a kick out of it'' if he knew how much his
self-portrait had brought.

   A gunman who killed his estranged wife was

   The man shot his wife to death Tuesday night in her home in
Danvers as their 5-year-old son watched, said state Trooper Mark
Lynch.
   The man, apparently armed with an assault rifle, flew the small
plane for more than three hours up and down the Massachusetts
coastline from Danvers to Duxbury, touching down briefly at Logan
but taking off again, Boston police spokeswoman Jill Reilly said.
   Alfred James Hunter III, 42, was captured shortly after 1 a.m.

Trainer had only five minutes worth of fuel left when it landed,
said Lynch. No weapons were recovered.

<HEAD>Charter Issued For Reforming Church Council</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's largest ecumenical organization,
the National Council of Churches, is struggling to overcome an
operational and financial crisis and to widen its work for
Christian unity.
   A proposed charter for that purpose was issued last week by a
special action Committee of 15 after six months of work and 35
regional consultations around the country.
   The committee's report, to be considered by the council's
governing board of 265 denominational representatives May 16-19 in
Lexington, Ky., calls for a reformation of the council's structure
and functioning.
   The changes ``will help our council be a viable entity in the
times in which we live,'' says United Methodist Bishop Melvin G.
Talbert of San Francisco, chairman of the reorganization committee.
   The council includes most of the nation's mainline Protestant
and Eastern Orthodox Churches with memberships totaling 42 million.
   Among other things, the plan provides for expanded involvement
with Roman Catholics and evangelical bodies, as well as
streamlining the council itself into a trimmer framework.
   It would fuse a complex, loose-knit array of 11 operational
units into three program units _ on unity and relationships,
witness and service, nuture and discipleship (Christian education).
Each unit, including denominational representatives, would have a
greater role in its own decision-making, programming and staffing,
thereby reducing centralized direction.
   This has been a source of recent friction and turmoil in the
39-year-old council.
   ``Critical problems have too often been papered over rather than
named, examined and resolved,'' says the committee, attributing
them to changed situations in the churches and in American culture.
   Neither the council ``nor even the entire Christian community
enjoy or expect the privileged status and moral authority they once
took for granted'' when the council was formed in 1950, the report
says.
   It says that not only is religion more pluralistic, but it and
the nation are pummeled by racism, sexism, secularism, nationalism
and expanding technologies and communications engulfing local
communities.
   Describing the council's trouble as a ``crisis built upon
multiple crises that are interactive and cumulative,'' the report
identifies three major areas of conflict _ over authority,
accountability and leadership.
   The conflicts emerged as the council sought to move from a
``cooperative agency'' of churches working together to a
``community of Christian communions'' acting in common faith and
mission as one in Christ.
   Some of the operational units, particularly the huge relief arm,
Church World Service, clashed with central leadership headed by the
Rev. Arie R. Brouwer and also with the governing board.
   ``Without a structure which was correlated to the new vision,
conflict inevitably arose,'' resulting in ``lack of trust'' and
hampering the council from working ``together fruitfully,'' the
report says.
   Brouwer says the new design aims to deal with the problems,
consolidating units and giving them greater rein in determining
priorities, but with accountability to an Executive Coordinating
Committee.
   The plan also calls for an annual ``Conference of Communions''
bringing representatives of all the participating churches into
mutual deliberations, and for a wider ecumenical forum every four
years.
   It would seek involvement of non-member churches, such as Roman
Catholics and Southern Baptists, which already participate in
several council functions, as well as various evangelical bodies.
   The council has a special six-member committee working on closer
links with Roman Catholicism, and in that cause a 12-member council
delegation in April visited Pope John Paul II and other Vatican
officials. It was the first such visit in 20 years.
   The talks ``give us hope for deepening levels of conversation
and community'' in progress toward ``full communion in Christ,''
the group said afterward.
   The council president, the Rev. Patricia McClurg, a Presbyterian
minister, said controversial issues such as ordination of women
were not discussed. ``But we share the same faith and if we draw
closer to Christ we draw closer to one another.''
   Roman Catholic Archbishop J. Francis Stafford of Denver, head of
the U.S. bishops' ecumenical committee who accompanied the council
delegation, called the affair an ``enriching exchange.''

   Church leaders from South Korea and
communist North Korea worshipped, discussed and sang together in a
rare gathering contemplating reunion of their divided country.
   In the first visit to the United States since Korea was divided
in 1945 at the end of World War II, four North Korean Christians
met with South Korean church representatives, along with about 100
U.S. church leaders.
   The Rev. Dwain Epps, international affairs officer of the
National Council of Churches which sponsored the conference, said:
   ``We don't have the power in our hands to make peace or reunify
Korea. But we have the opportunity to respond to the call of the
Christians of the South and North to assist them to find a
reunified future.''
   The council launched an ecumenical campaign to educate U.S.
church members about continuing human costs of a divided Korea,
including separation of families and a devastating war in which 4
million died.

``decisive, imaginative leadership if we are to break through from
one stage of the ecumenical movement to the next.''
   Failure to do so will lead to cynicism, frustration and
abandonment of the cause, he told a gathering about 500 Roman

   The moderate candidate for the Southern
Baptist Convention presidency, the Rev. Daniel Vestal of Atlanta,
says he will try to dilute the power of the office if he is elected.
   Fundamentalists have won the presidency over the last 10 years
and used the presidential appointive power to name trustees
controlling denomination agencies.
   ``For the last 10 years it has been winner take all,'' Vestal
told a meeting of moderates, saying he hopes to change that pattern
to ``winner shares all.''
   He is to oppose the fundamentalist-backed incumbent president,
the Rev. Jerry Vines of Jacksonville, Fla., when the Southern
Baptists meet June 13-15 in Las Vegas, Nev.
   Moderates say they have been excluded from key appointments _
particularly to a powerful committee which names trustees governing
denominational agencies _in the decade in which the denomination
has come under fundamentalist control.

   Despite a more grown-up role as cowboy Newt
in the acclaimed CBS miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' Rick Schroder is
still struggling with a transition from his child star status to
adult roles.
   ``So it's hard,'' said Schroder. ``A lot of people say it can
never be done successfuly. Natalie Wood did it. Maybe a few other
actors.''
   Schroder was 8 when he made his film debut in 1979 opposite Jon
Voight in a remake of ``The Champ,'' then spent five years playing
a rich kid in the comedy series ``Silver Spoons.''
   On Sunday, in the CBS movie ``Out on the Edge,'' he plays a
troubled teen-ager who is sent against his will to an institution.
   ``Making the transition is not easy,'' he said. ``In fact, it's
pretty hard. But it's getting easier with each new role. Everything
since `Silver Spoons' has been a role that's helped me grow up. I'm
being taken more seriously for adult roles. I don't want to be 30
and still playing high-school kids.''
   Schroder has been passed over for a few roles that went to older
actors.
   ``I went up for a role in a movie with Robert De Niro called
`The Freshman,''' he said. ``The script calls for a 19-year-old,
which is my age. They cast Matthew Broderick. He's got to be 30. I
said, that's not fair, and it's not realistic.''
   He'd also wanted the lead role in ``Gore Vidal's Billy the Kid''
on Turner Network Television. It went to the older Val Kilmer.
   Mention the names of child stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and
Mickey Rooney who went on to adult careers in show business, and
Schroder says, ``I'm talking about actors. Those are celebrities.''
   In the CBS movie, Schroder plays Danny Evetts, 17, who is
committed to a behavioral treatment center when his divorced mother
is unable to control him.
   The movie also stars Maya Lebenzon as a young patient who
befriends Danny, Mary Kay Place as Danny's mother, Richard Jenkins
as his father and Dakin Matthews as the hospital administrator.
   ``This is a good role for me because I get to be bad,'' said
Schroder. ``I usually play such angelic roles. In this one, I'm
really messed up. Danny's a good guy. He's not a jerk or nothing.
But he's got problems he doesn't know how to deal with. He starts
to hurt himself and those around him.''
   Schroder has let his blond hair grow long and has grown a wispy
beard for an expected role as a basketball player and cocaine
addict. He also had to lose 20 pounds.
   The end of ``Lonesome Dove'' looked like a good jumping-off
place for a story about Newt, and that apparently wasn't lost on
Schroder. He said that on a recent visit to New York he talked to
CBS officials about doing a sequel to ``Lonesome Dove.'' No story
has been drawn up, but it probably would include Woodrow Call
(Tommy Lee Jones) finally owning up to the fact that he is Newt's
father.
   Schroder said he's also writing a CBS Schoolbreak Special about
two young people who fall in love. The boy has a severe case of
acne, and the girl was burned in a fire. They help heal each other
emotionally. He hopes to direct it.
   ``I've never had a directing credit, but I've directed before,''
he said. ``You direct scenes you're in. Sometimes you work with a
director you don't think is good or you don't like. You do your own
thing.''
   Schroder began acting in New York and appeared in more than 45
commercials before ``The Champ.''
   ``Talk about your life changing overnight,'' he said. ``It all
happened so quickly. My sister had also done some commercials, and
I was following in her footsteps. She's now studying to become a
screenwriter at the University of Southern California. I'd like to
take some courses, too, but I don't want take out time to go to
college.''

   In one sense, this small native fishing
village was spared. Although the tanker Exxon Valdez hemorrhaged
more than 10 million gallons of crude just 5 miles from their cove,
local folks have seen little of the oil in their waters.
   In another sense, they're not so fortunate. ``It's probably
still going to get us,'' says village president Gary Kompkoff.
   ``Right now most of us would be out collecting salmon spawn,''
he said. ``But that has been canceled. We're not sure if we're
going to be able to fish at all this year. Ninety-eight percent of
the annual income of the village is fishing.''
   Tatitlek, settled in the late 1800s on the northern shore of
Prince William Sound, has 95 residents. All but 10 are Aleut
Indians, and many are Russian Orthodox, typical of this part of
Alaska.
   Tatitlek fishermen have caught salmon in Prince William Sound
for decades, but since the Exxon Valdez ran aground on Bligh Reef
on March 24, the familiar cycle of village life has been disrupted.
   ``Right now we're just trying to understand what this will mean
for us long term,'' said Kompkoff.
   The lucrative herring season has already been canceled.
   In the nearby fishing town of Cordova, loss of the herring catch
will cost $12 million. But Cordova fisherman are making up some of
the loss with income from working booms for Exxon, gathering
remnants of the spill in their boats.
   Few of Tatitlek's fishermen have been offered such work.
   Says Kompkoff, ``We've gone from fear to anger to apprehension
over this thing. It's going to be with us for a long time to come.''

<TEXT>
   As the villain, Manuel Antonio Noriega is
perfectly cast. He even sounds like a dictator. His pockmarked
cheeks, his shouted speeches, his belligerent manner all mark the
strong man of Panama as the obvious bad guy.
   Furthermore, by the measures known to American political
leaders, many of his own countrymen hate his guts. He also is
predictable: everybody said he would steal Sunday's Panamanian
elections and the evidence is that he did so.
   With traits like that he ought to be an ideal adversary.
   But he also has been a survivor. ``Our policy remains that
Noriega must go,'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said Tuesday.
   But the policy prior to that one involved a secret partnership
with the Panamanian general against Nicaragua's Marxist-run
government.
   That may be one of the reasons that he is a survivor. The United
States has been trying to bring him down since 1987, with
negotiations, political opposition, threats, economic sanctions and
criminal charges, all of them withstood.
   As head of the Panamanian Defense Forces, Noriega's power is
solidly rooted in the military. Unfortunately for 1989
policymakers, before beginning the effort to get rid of him, the
U.S. government tried to use him.
   The Reagan administration's Nicaragua fixation led to
collaboration with Noriega. The government's statement of facts at
the Oliver North trial told of an offer from the Panamanian boss in
late August 1986:
   ``Noriega's representative proposed that, in exchange for a
promise from the U.S. government to help clean up Noriega's image
and a commitment to lift the U.S. government ban on military sales
to the Panamanian defense forces, Noriega would assassinate the
Sandinista leadrship for the U.S. government.''
   North said that would be illegal. Noriega's man replied that the
Panamanian could help in other ways, as when he had helped blow up
a Sandinista arsenal in 1985.
   According to the court papers, Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter,
then the White House national security adviser, said that if
Noriega ``had assets inside Nicaragua, he could be helpful. The
U.S. government could not be involved in assassination, but
Panamanian assistance with sabotage would be another story.''
   In September 1986, North said Noriega wanted to meet him in
London. Poindexter and Secretary of State George Shultz both
approved that meeting. North returned to report that Noriega
``would try to take immediate actions against the Sandinistas. ..
.''
   That cozy relationship lends an ironic flavor to warnings in
Congress that if Noriega got away with stealing an election, the
Sandinistas would have scant incentive to deliver on their promise
of free elections in Nicaragua early next year.
   The era of U.S. collaboration with Noriega withstood initial
accusations that he was involved in drug trafficking. However, the
Reagan administration was trying to get rid of him before federal
grand juries in Florida returned drug-dealing indictments against
him in early 1988.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., calls Panama an example of what the
drug trade does to democracy. ``What is clear from the Panamanian
experience is that drug enforcement took a back seat to perceived
foreign policy concerns,'' he said last week.
   Bush and a unanimous 100 senators declared in advance of the
Sunday voting that the United States would not tolerate a rigged
election and would respond accordingly. They also declared in
advance that Noriega's candidate could not win anything but a
rigged election.
   The question now is what will work. Two years of gradually
escalating sanctions have battered the Panamanian economy without
dislodging Noriega. The White House says no option, including the
use of military force, now is foreclosed.
   The preferred option, of course, would be for the Panamanians to
get rid of him themselves, rising up to insist on the leadership
they are said to have chosen with their burned ballots.
   Bush is urging Noriega to step aside because of the verdict of
his countrymen. Should it require a heavier push from the outside,
the United States needs to have it come from other Latin American
capitals, not only from Washington.
   Noriega long ago mastered the political art of rallying
supporters and even some skeptics by claiming Yankee interference
in Panama. Even Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega turned up in Panama City
in June 1987, to express support for Noriega against U.S. pressure
to get him out.
   That was less than a year after Noriega was said to have sent
North the secret offer to assassinate the Sandinista leadership.

the horror that Americans often feel that foreigners, eager to own
American investments, are buying us out of house, home and country.
   It isn't quite so, even though the United States is in a
negative position in regard to international investments, with
foreigners investing roughly $370 billion more in this country than
Americans invest abroad.
   And, yes, it is true that if foreigners en masse buy or sell
American assets they could indeed disrupt segments of the American
economy, raising or lowering prices precipitously.
   But some assurances are in order:
   1. Foreigners can only load financial paper, not physical
assets, onto those imaginary ships. But why should they? By cashing
in their chips they would be foresaking investments in the world's
biggest single marketplace.
   2. Some of the big figures that are tossed about aren't, for
many practical purposes, what they seem to be.
   When, for example, J. Paul Getty left the United States for
residence in Britain he caused a big drop in the officialy reported
U.S. investment position. But Getty took not a dime with him when
he relocated.
   That latter example is used by Robert Brown, Tax Foundation
president, to make a point: The negative investment position of the
United States may be no reason to cheer, but it is no reason to
grind teeth either.
   Brown points out that while foreign investment in the United
States exceeds $1.5 trillion, the United States is no slouch in
foreign investments, with total U.S. assets abroad amounting to
around $1.2 trillion.
   That, he suggests, is what the global economy is all about, and
that to suggest a perfect balance of investments is unrealistic.
   Foreigners invest in the United States, he says, because it is a
desirable place in which to invest. He points to a strong economy,
stable politics, dynamic private sector and a labor force that can
produce with the best.
   Why shouldn't they want to invest in such a market?
   Still, he suggests, that isn't the reason why foreigners invest
more here than we do there. The real reason, he says, is that U.S.
tax policy discourages Americans from saving _ that is, investing _
in their own country.
   What this country needs in order to correct the imbalance of
investments, says Brown, are incentives for savings and investments
and a tax policy that aids rather than damages the competitive
position of U.S. companies.
   In that respect he places himself among a growing list of
critics of U.S. taxing practice, which penalizes those who risk
capital, imposes taxes on those who save, and provides tax breaks
for being in debt.
   Change the tax situation, he suggests, and Americans might
recognize what foreigners see in the U.S. economy: A superior
investment opportunity.

<HEAD>Credit Card Rates On The Rise</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The cost of plastic is rising again.
   Tracking the trend in interest rates, many financial
institutions have been boosting the rates or fees on standard
credit cards for the first time in several months. Some are
shrinking or scrapping grace periods.
   The rate rise began late last year but has been particularly
noticeable lately with some of the nation's largest banks and
thrifts announcing changes.
   As of June 1, for instance, two of the largest bank credit card
issuers, Chase Manhattan Bank and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co.,
plan to raise rates on some types of Mastercard and Visa cards.
   Chase's rate will go to 19.8 percent from 17.5 percent on
standard cards, the first increase in about two years.
Manufacturers Hanover will hike some standard card rates to 19.8
percent from 17.8 percent for the first time since October 1985.
   John C. Pollock III, editor and publisher of Iselin, N.J.-based
Bank Credit Card Observer, said the majority of the 200 banks his
publication regularly surveys has raised card rates since January.
The average rate among those institutions now stands at 17.78
percent, he said, up from 17.61 percent just three months ago. The
prime stands at 11.5 percent.
   Financial institutions have defended the high rates as necessary
to cover costs and fraud. They've also called the move a reaction
to higher interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve to
restrain inflation.
   Credit-card using consumers themselves have been cutting into
bank profits by paying the full balance at the end of the month in
increasing numbers, about 40 percent in 1988 vs. 37 percent in 1987.
   ``With credit cards there's a high degree of administration cost
as opposed to your plain vanilla loan,'' said Chase spokesman Ken
Mills. ``There are literally hundreds of small transactions as
cards are used.''
   Elgie Holstein, director of Bankcard Holders of America, a
consumer group based in Herndon, Va., said he doesn't dispute that,
but says the spread between banks' cost of funds and what they
charge credit card customers is excessive.
   ``It costs banks about 7 percent for money they're lending out
at 18 to 20 percent,'' he said.
   Consumers can shop for better deals by doing some homework, and
the government will make it easier Aug. 31.
   That's when a new law takes full effect forcing all card issuers
to supply complete credit terms, such as the interest rates, fees
and grace periods, on applications and solicitations. They
previously had been permitted to delay the release of such
information until the card was issued.
   Consumer groups are hoping the disclosure law will make credit
card rates _ historically high compared with other loan rates _
more competitive, especially if banks and thrifts must advertise
them.
   Those who tend to carry over their balances should shop for the
lowest rates, while those who pay them promptly are better off
seeking institutions offering no or low annual fees.
   ``Many Americans aren't aware that you can easily go out of
state'' to find the best deal, said Robert K. Heady, editor of Bank
Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla., publication that tracks
conventional credit card rates nationwide.
   Bank Rate Monitor, Bank Credit Card Observer and Bankcard
Holders of America are among organizations that provide lists of
best deals in credit cards for a fee.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the lowest rate for those carrying
balances is at Arkansas Federal Savings Bank in Little Rock, Ark.,
which had an 11.88 percent annual rate as of May 3.
   NCNB offered one of the best all-round deals, with no annual fee
and a 13.90 percent variable rate, Bank Rate Monitor said.
   Others with no fees, it said, included: Amalgamated Trust and
Savings Bank in Chicago; Dauphin Deposit Bank &amp; Trust in
Harrisburg, Pa.; Security Bank &amp; Trust in Southgate, Mich.; and
Beverly Bank in Chicago.
   Consumers also should scrutinize credit card fees, which have
been creeping up, and grace periods, or the time before lenders
charge interest on unpaid bills. Grace periods range from 0 to 30
days.
   Experts say in recent months some institutions have eliminated
or trimmed grace periods. In some cases, the grace period was
revised to begin after a purchase is made instead of when a bill is
sent.
   ``By the time you receive your bill you may be subject to an
interest charge,'' Pollock said.

<HEAD>Guadalupe Center Preserving Hispanic Arts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID SEDENO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pedro Rodriguez fondly remembers the fun he
had as a kid watching Mexican plays and feature films at the
Guadalupe Theater, which in its heyday during the 1940s and '50s
served as the anchor for Mexican art and entertainment in the city.
   Today, Rodriguez still has fun as executive director of the
Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center, a non-profit organization that not
only runs the restored 410-seat theater, but sponsors literary,
theatrical, musical, dance, painting and visual arts workshops and
shows to preserve Mexican culture.
   With grants from the city and federal governments and
corporations, the center already has the nation's largest
curriculum devoted to development and preservation of Mexican
cultural arts, and operates on a $1 million annual budget.
   ``Were it not for the fact that the Mexican culture itself is
very strong here, the cultural arts would not have survived, but it
just barely did and I think the creation of this institution is
very timely,'' said Rodriguez, a former university professor who
took over the Guadalupe Cultural Arts Center in 1983, a year after
it was formed.
   ``Now, we have hundreds of artists yearly that we support
directly through contracts and through the training that we provide
for about 900 students per year and the art and cultural events
throughout the community.''
   But the center hopes to preserve more than just cultural arts;
it also hopes to improve the area's social and economic environment.
   The center and the Avenida Guadalupe Development Association, a
non-profit economic development agency, are transforming a
three-block area around the Guadalupe Theater from a dilapidated
barrio dominated by bars and shacks to a medical, retail and
entertainment showplace that will serve one of the city's oldest
Hispanic neighborhoods.
   ``I think all this construction and all the changes are going to
help everyone here,'' said 48-year-old Roger Mercado, a lifelong
resident of the Guadalupe area. ``I think all the art coming out of
here also will help us communicate with the rest of the community.''
   The Guadalupe Theater, opened in the 1939, served as host for
hundreds of Spanish-language plays and movie premieres until it
fell into disrepair in the early '70s. In 1979, performing and
visual arts groups banded together to better secure funding for
Hispanic arts. By 1982, the group was known as the Guadalupe
Cultural Arts Center. A year later, the city provided $1 million
for renovation of the Guadalupe Theater, which by then was being
used as a flea market.
   Rodriguez said the center's 17-member staff has had to use all
types of marketing techniques to attract not only those in the
neighborhood, but many non-Hispanics who are weary of traveling to
an area surrounded by housing projects.
   ``There is a certain image about coming to this side of town
that we have to get people past, and that was that it was not safe
to come over here. But that's not true. Once they get over here, we
know we have them hooked, and I think everyone in the community is
pretty proud of what is happening here,'' Rodriquez said.
   The Guadalupe Theater now holds art exhibitions in its foyer
gallery, brings in foreign and artistic films and is home to the
San Antonio CineFestival, a Hispanic film festival in its 13th
year. Its other major event is the Tejano Conjunto Festival, a
four-day event now in its eighth year, which will bring in hundreds
of artists and thousands of spectators to hear accordian-playing
musicians.
   The theater also is home to the Theatre Arts Program, which
produces up to four bilingual plays a year through its resident
company, Los Actores de San Antonio, the Actors of San Antonio.
   The center's visual arts program annually sponsors about nine
exhibits, with emphasis on Hispanic and Native American artists. In
the summer, it provides a free, weekly outdoor film festival in
Guadalupe Plaza.
   The center's literature program offers poetry and fiction
readings and annually sponsors a bookfair. This year's major
presenters are Pulitzer Prize winner Alice Walker (``The Color
Purple''), and Mexican poet Octavio Paz.
   Classes for adults and children are offered in all the various
arts programs at the center and 15 other locations across the city.
   ``We work out of very makeshift kinds of situations. The only
thing that we do have that is first-rate is the theater, but
everything else that we do, we do on a shoestring and in poor
conditions,'' Rodriguez said.
   ``But our vision centers around the creation of an institution
that will be anchored in bedrock, here to stay forever, to provide
services so the Mexican arts culture continues to subsist and
flourish.''
   There are plans for a 50,000-square-foot classroom and office
building next to the theater. Rodriquez also envisions use of the
former Progreso Theater, across the street from the Guadalupe, as a
rehearsal and reception hall.
   Those developments would add to area renovations by the
development association, which built Guadalupe Plaza and plans to
open a 48-stall Mexican market later this spring. A private drug
store and medical complex already are operating next to the plaza.
   The Avenida Guadalupe Development Association has spent $7.5
million in the past decade renovating three city blocks surrounding
the Guadalupe Theater.
   ``This neighborhood was one of the pride and joys of San
Antonio, but because of demographic and social changes it began to
deteriorate in the 1960s and '70s,'' said David Garza, executive
director of the development agency.
   ``We are just trying to revitalize the area and change the
conditions of the neighorhood to attract the businesses and the
families, or otherwise we are going to see this neighborhood die
away,'' Garza said.

<HEAD>Bus Crash Anniversary Marked by More Questions Than Answers</HEAD>

   Whenever Lee Williams sees a school bus he
thinks of his wife and daughters, and of one gnawing question that
remains for him a year after their deaths shattered his life: ``How
do you put it back together?'
   Joy Williams, 10-year-old Robin and 14-year-old Kristen were
among the 24 children and three adults killed a year ago Sunday
when an allegedly drunken driver slammed into the bus carrying 67
people home from a church outing.
   ``Before you put something back together, you have to have
pieces. He has no pieces,'' said the Rev. W. Don Tennison, whose
Radcliff First Assembly of God church sponsored the trip to an
amusement park.
   The crash, the nation's worst alcohol-related highway accident,
also raised questions about school bus safety and treatment of
drunken drivers. The acting chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board called it ``one of the most influential highway
accidents'' the board had ever considered.
   Recommendations have been made to get some older buses off the
road. The bus involved, a 1977 model, was manufactured before
federal regulations on some safety matters took effect, such as
protective cages around gas tanks.
   Emergency push-out windows have been added to school buses in
Kentucky after it was revealed that the emergency exit in the back
of the bus was partly blocked by seats and hard to use because of a
narrow aisle.
   Because the deaths were caused by smoke inhalation,
recommendations also have been made to use less flammable, less
toxic materials in bus seats.
   A state school bus safety task force apparently will recommend
testing all fuel for buses as the debate over fuel explosiveness
continues.
   Stricter drunken driving laws have been endorsed by Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson, though the General Assembly has shown reluctance to get
too tough.
   ``The law's not fair here. The law's not right,'' said Williams.
He notes that Kentucky law allows the vehicle of a deer poacher to
be seized. No such provision is allowed for drunken drivers.
``Where's the value?''
   Larry W. Mahoney of rural Owen County was driving the pickup,
police say, on the wrong side of Interstate 71. His blood alcohol
level two hours after the accident was 0.24; legal intoxication in
Kentucky is 0.10.
   Mahoney was indicted on 27 counts of murder, 13 of assault, 44
of wanton endangerment and one of driving under the influence,
second offense. He pleaded innocent and could be given 27 life
sentences plus 480 years if he is convicted on all counts at his
trial in November. Meanwhile, he is free on bond.
   For Williams, that raises another question: ``Can you promise me
tonight this guy won't drink and drive?''
   It's drunken driving that continues to prompt the most
discussion and activity in this town near Fort Knox. ``It's made
the judges not only in our area but in the whole county more aware
of the need to tighten up on the law and enforce it more
strictly,'' said Mayor Joseph Hutcherson.
   Students Against Drunken Driving chapters are active at Radcliff
Middle School and North Hardin High School. Linda Probus, a
counselor hired to help students cope with the tragedy, said
drinking and driving is no longer acceptable behavior among the
students.
   Residents take time to pull off the road to report suspected
drunken drivers, said Police Officer Greg Mayfield.
   On the anniversary of the crash, Radcliff is holding a memorial
expected to draw hundreds of people.
   Many of those touched by the crash have mixed emotions about the
ceremony.
   ``I think the community, not to forget the families, is ready to
put the accident to rest,'' said Dick Booher, whose son Jason
escaped from the bus.
   ``We want to be left alone. We want to try to put our lives back
together,'' said Williams, a career soldier who spends much of his
off-duty time speaking publicly about the dangers of drunken
driving.
   But another reminder of the tragedy will come Nov. 8 when
Mahoney goes on trial. His role is still a troubling one for many
involved.
   Ms. Probus said many of the students who survived the crash have
changed their attitudes toward Mahoney. ``Initially, they really,
really wanted Mahoney to die.'' As they have come to grips with the
tragedy, they ``want him punished, left in jail, but not to be
killed.''
   The memorial Sunday will mark a milepost in this tragedy but
will not end it. Legislators still will debate tougher laws. State
agencies will weigh the benefits of additional training for school
bus drivers against the cost. Drunken drivers still will kill
innocent victims.
   First Sgt. Lee Williams still will think of his family when he
sees a bus. And he will continue to warn people of the danger.
   ``I give these speeches for the Robins and the Kristens who
haven't been killed. I give these speeches for the husbands and the
wives who haven't been hurt.''

<TEXT>
   ``These are the days of the anonymous
nocturnal bullet, of the slashing of throats of village officials,
of the disappearance of union leaders.''
   So wrote Cesar Hilderbrandt in a column recently in Si magazine
in a passage that epitomizes the desperation of today's Peru, a
nation struggline with economic chaos and a savage leftist
insurgency that threatens to explode into civil war.
   From cab drivers to congressmen, Peruvians are asking themselves
what went wrong in their Andean country, which had one of South
America's strongest economies until the 1960s.
   _More than 14,000 people have been killed in the nine-year
uprising by the the leftist Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso)
guerrilla organization. Blackouts and bombs have become part of
daily life in Lima. A paramilitary death squad has made its
appearance.
   _Inflation hit a record 1,722 percent in 1988 and is widely
projected to soar above 10,000 percent this year, pushing wages and
salaries down to bare-survival levels. The economy shrank 9 percent
in 1988 and is likely to contract even more this year.
   _The collapse is putting hundreds of thousands of people out of
work in the continent's third largest country and one of its
poorest. In 1976, Peru produced 34,000 automobiles; this year it is
expected to assemble, at the most, 3,500. Few people can afford
them.
   Although many Peruvians blame President Alan Garcia for the
chaos, most independent analysts say the economic crisis had been
building toward an eruption for the past several decades; Garcia's
populist, free-spending policies lit the fuse.
   Highway bandits have begun waylaying buses and automobiles,
making travel outside Lima dangerous and adding to the sense of a
disintegrating nation where law and order has broken down.
   Many Peruvians now speak of ``the civil war that is coming,''
seeing it as inevitable.
   ``There is a very real danger that Peru, without realizing it,
is sinking deeper into the swamps of fratricidal war,'' the
magazine Oiga commented in a recent editorial.
   Surveys indicate most people have little faith that solutions
will be found.
   Garcia, a dynamic young leader, was elected in 1985 as ``the
president of hope.'' But his defiant stance against paying the
foreign debt, now $19 billion, cut Peru off from international aid
and his uncontrolled spending bankrupted the country, critics say.
   These days angry crowds shout ``Alan, you charlatan'' when he
speeds by in heavily armed convoys.
   In recent months Lima has been hit by waves of coup rumors and
many Peruvians doubt the presidential election scheduled for April
1990 will take place. Leftist military officers seized power in
1968; constitutional government was restored in 1980.
   Former Mayor Alfonso Barrantes of Lima, a Marxist, is one of the
favorites in the campaign. The other front-runner is the writer
Mario Vargas Llosa, leader of a center-right coalition.
   Peruvians frequently mention the opening passage in Vargas
Llosa's 1974 novel ``Conversation in the Cathedral,'' saying it
succinctly reflects their feelings now:
   ``From the doorway of La Cronica, Santiago looks at the Avenida
Tacna without love: cars, uneven and faded buildings, the gaudy
skeletons of posters floating in the mist, the gray midday. At what
precise moment had Peru (screwed) itself up?''
   One who saw things that way was Morty Weisselberg, 41, a
second-generation Peruvian, who had a high-paying job as the
manager of a small metallurgical company. He packed up and left a
few months ago for Canada with his wife and two small daughters.
Before he left he explained why.
   ``What worries me is the kind of future I am going to leave my
children. `The future that this country offers is very different
from the one 30 years ago when I was in the position of my
children. Then there was a bright future for the country, at least
apparently.''
   The Weisselbergs were among 150,000 Peruvians, most of them
professionals and skilled workers, who bought one-way tickets out
the country in 1988, the largest exodus in Peru's history.

   Many blame Peru's economic decline on several decades of
government mismanagement, controls that have stifled private
enterprise and strident nationalism that has frightened away
foreign investors and isolated Peru from world financial centers.
   More than anything, Weisselberg said before he left, he was
frightened by what he saw as the country's deep class divisions and
its growing violence.
   Political analysts agree with him that Peru's social and racial
divisions, inherited from the Spanish colonial era, have spawned
class hatred that threatens to rip apart the fabric of Peruvian
society.
   The scorn and discrimination shown by Peru's white elite toward
the dark-skinned Indian and mestizo majority has generated deep
resentment among Peru's poor, say social scientists.
   ``Political violence in Peru is not the result of poverty alone
but of humiliation, oppression, class hatred, racism,'' said Sen.
Enrique Bernales, head of a blue-ribbon Senate panel on violence.
   For many Peruvian and foreign political experts, Peru now stands
at a critical point in its 165-year history where an antiquated,
inequitable and inefficient politial structure is crumbling.
   ``For me the Shining Path is nothing more than the violent
natural expression of this social explosion,'' said Luis Lumbreras,
one of Peru's most important archaeologists. ``If it had not been
Shining Path, sooner or later there would have been another group,''
   Lumbreras is from Ayacucho, the impoverished highland province
where the Maoist-inspired guerrillas launched their insurgency in
1980, after 10 years of organizing among Quechua-speaking Indians
in the countryside.
   Peru covers an area larger than Texas, New Mexico and Arizona
combined and has a population of 21 million. But just as it is
divided by class and race, it is sharrply divided by its geography
into three regions _ the Andean sierra, the coastal deserts and the
Amazon rain forest _ that feel little in common with one another.
   In the 1950s highland peasants began to crowd into Lima, the
capital, looking for a better life, and the migration has
accelerated in recent years as the countryside has turned into a
battlefield.
   With the Shining Path insurgency and the forced integration of
Lima and other coastal cities, Peru's white class has begun to feel
challenged for the first time.
   Once the royal capital of the Spanish empire in South America,
Lima is surrounded by the bleakest shantytowns on the continent,
home to two thirds of the city's 7 million inhabitants.
   Lima's rich, increasingly insecure, live behind high walls in
suburbs to which entry is controlled by gates and armed guards.
   The economic collapse, regarded as the worst in Peru's history,
has hit the middle class and the poor the hardest.
   The purchasing power of salaries has plummeted by at least 50
percent in the last year. A doctor at a public hospital earns the
equivalent of $80 a month. A public school teacher earns $55. The
value of an army general's salary has fallen from $1,100 a month in
1980 to $200 today.
   Dorotea Sandoval lives with her husband and eight children in
the shantytown of Villa El Salvador, where mothers boil fish bones
to give a thin broth to their children.
   ``We stopped eating meat a long time ago,'' she said.

   Doctors have found a new way to augment their
income: the sale of prescription drugs. But the trend has raised
the issue of conflict of interest, with some questioning the
propriety of doctors profiting from drugs they prescribe. In the
third article in a continuing series, ``The Business of Medicine,''
Science Writer Daniel Q. Haney and National Writer Fred Bayles
report on the debate over doctors selling drugs. The next story in

   When family doctors pull out their
prescription pads, they often have a new question for patients: Do
you pay for your own medicine?
   ``If they do,'' says Dr. John Garofalo, ``I tell them, `You can
purchase your medications here.'''
   Doctors are going into the drug business. While these physicians
contend it is good for patients, others believe this venture is a
clear conflict of interest, for it can give physicians a financial
reason to write unnecessary prescriptions.
   Accurate figures are elusive, but experts estimate that perhaps
8 percent of the 330,000 office-based physicians have miniature
pharmacies on hand.
   The business is fast and simple. The doctor reaches into a
cabinet, pulls out a single-prescription bottle of antibiotics or
decongestant, fills out the label and sells the medicine on the
spot, usually for about the same price as the neighborhood
drugstore.
   Not everyone can buy from their doctors. Many insurers don't pay
for physician-sold drugs and most doctors don't accept insurance
cards. But if patients pay their own pill bills, they almost always
buy from their doctors.
   Those who branch into this new sideline find it easy to justify:
The patient likes the convenience, and the doctor can often clear
$10,000 or more a year with little extra work.
   ``We don't sniff at the profit,'' said Dr. Edward Saltzman, but
``it's not the path to riches.''
   While his 12-member pediatrics group in suburban Miami clears
$70,000 to $80,000 a year on medicines, Saltzman views drug sales
primarily as a marketing tool to build patient loyalty. ``It's
another way of bonding them to us,'' he said.
   In most of the country, doctors can routinely sell medicine with
minimal regulation. Only seven states _ Arkansas, Massachusetts,
Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas and Utah _ make it difficult or
impossible.
   The doctors buy their pills from wholesalers called repackagers.
This industry, in existence barely a decade, puts medicines in
patient-size bottles and supplies them to doctors along with
suggested price lists, peel-off labels and charts for easy
record-keeping.
   Some are concerned this venture could erode medicine's ethical
underpinnings. They worry that doctors might write prescriptions to
get the $3 profit they make on each one, not because sick people
need them. While most doctors undoubtedly are honest, the ethicists
fear physician dispensing, as it's called, will undermine patients'
faith in their doctors.
   ``What matters is whether there is a potential conflict of
interest and whether this is perceived by patients and therefore
undermines trust,'' said Daniel Wikler, a University of Wisconsin
bioethicist.
   Those who dislike the practice cite several potential abuses:
   _Doctors might prescribe only the 20 or 30 medications they keep
in their offices, even though these may not be the best ones in
particular situations.
   _Patients might feel pressured to buy medicine from their
doctors for fear of offending them.
   _Doctors might concentrate on drugs with the highest profit
margins or prescribe unnecessarily to make more money.
   At least some doctors do bend to such enticements. In the last
three years, about 15 states have taken disciplinary action against
doctors for dispensing abuses, according to a recent survey by the
inspector general's office of the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services. Among the most common problems was over-prescribing.
   While dispensing doctors say they would never compromise their
integrity, they do agree they view dispensing as one element of a
more important question: economic survival. They are squeezed on
one side by cut-rate fees from Medicare and Medicaid, on the other
by competition from health maintenance organizations and other
doctors.
   ``With the way things are going, especially in primary care, we
have to keep trying to think of more and more ways to make a
dollar,'' said Garofalo, a 35-year-old family practitioner here in
Maine's capital.
   Garofalo started filling presriptions three years ago. Two of
the other three family practices in the city have followed his lead.
   Now, Garofalo and two associates net $5,000 to $10,000 a year on
medicines. While this might be small potatoes to a heart surgeon,
doctors on the front lines of primary care are less grandly paid.
In Maine, for instance, family practitioners average $54,000 a year.
   ``You can't survive in medicine these days if you don't let the
business part influence some of what you do,'' said Garofalo.
   Physicians are not distributed evenly throughout the country or
across specialties, and many places have too many doctors. There
simply are not enough patients to go around. So to some doctors,
selling medicine is a tactic that sets them apart from the
competition so they can attract and hold patients.
   ``It's a good service for the patient,'' said Dr. Norman
Glanzman, a family practitioner in Carmel, Ind. ``People often come
in coughing and feeling ill. The last thing they want to do is wait
around at a drugstore.''
   But Dr. Norman Fost, head of the ethics committee of the
American Academy of Pediatrics, believes it is wrong for doctors to
sell medicines for profit, because this may influence their
prescribing habits.
   ``As it says in the Bible, where your treasure is, there your
heart will be,'' he said.
   Several major doctor organizations, including Fost's
pediatricians and the American Academy of Family Physicians, have
official policies that uphold physicians' right to dispense.
   The American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and
Judicial Affairs came out against regular dispensing because of its
``appearance of impropriety.'' But the AMA's House of Delegates
later voted in favor of physicians' right to dispense drugs ``when
it is in the best interest of the patient.''
   ``We make countless decisions regarding how long a patient stays
in the hospital, whether he comes back for a re-visit, how often to
do laboratory studies,'' said Dr. Daniel W. Shea, a Green Bay,
Wis., pediatrician. ``I think that for the practicing physician,
life is one continuum of conflict of interest. But you must put the
the best interest of the patient first.''
   Despite such sentiment and support from various medical
associations, individual doctors such as family practitioner Dudley
Phillips of Darlington, Md., find the trend unappealing. ``I've
always felt I might get too interested in selling drugs and not
taking care of people,'' he said.
   And pediatrician William Bartholome of the University of Kansas
said any patient walking out of a doctor's office with five bottles
of medicine should ask himself:
   ``Are these the drugs I needed? Or were these the drugs that had
the best profit margin and that the doc just happened to have on
hand? Did I need all five of them? Or did I get them because my
doctor needs a new car?''

   The nation's biggest black-owned company
garnered nearly $2 billion in revenue last year and the 100 biggest
experienced healthy growth, according to a survey by Black
Enterprise magazine.
   The top 100 black-owned industrial and service companies
achieved revenue growth of 14.4 percent, vs. 7.6 percent for the
Fortune 500, in spite of cutting their staffs by 21.7 percent, the
magazine said in a report released today.
   Black-owned auto dealerships, which are in a separate top-100
list, saw sales rise 14.4 percent last year, the magazine said.
   ``As the next decade fast approaches, the nation's largest black
businesses are readying themselves,'' Black Enterprise stated in
its June issue.
   Reginald Lewis's TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc.
continued to dominate the list. Its $1.96 billion in revenue
accounted for close to half the $4.46 billion grossed by the 100
companies combined.
   Lewis acquired the international companies of Beatrice Cos., the
giant food processor and distributor, in a $985 million buyout in
1987 and has paid off debt incurred in the purchase by selling
divisions. He personally owns 55 percent of the stock, a Black
Enterprise spokesman said.
   Divestitures last year by New York-based TLC Beatrice cut the
payroll nearly in half, to 11,000 from 20,365, accounting for
nearly the entire staff decline in the 100 companies. However, TLC
Beatrice revenue rose 8.9 percent.
   Johnson Publishing Co. Inc. of Chicago, the publisher,
broadcaster and maker of cosmetics and hair-care products, retained
second place on the list with $216.5 million in revenue.
   J. Bruce Llewellyn's Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Inc.,
the soft-drink bottler, kept third place with $210 million.
   H.J. Russell &amp; Co. of Atlanta, a company involved in
construction, property management and food and beverages, stayed in
fourth place with revenue of $160 million.
   In fifth was Gordy Co. of Los Angeles, formerly Motown
Industries Inc., which changed its name when it sold its flagship
Motown Records to MCA Inc. and the investment banker Boston
Ventures last year for an estimated $61 million. Gains in other
businesses contributed to a rise in revenue to $105 million from
$100 million the year before.
   Construction companies accounted for 19 of the top 100
companies, followed by 16 food and beverage companies, 13 computer
and information companies and 12 manufacturing companies.
   Among the nation's 100 biggest black-owned auto dealerships,
sales rose to $2.33 billion.
   ``The long-predicted bust'' for black-owned auto dealers ``does
not appear to be on the horizon _ at least not anytime soon,'' the
magazine stated.
   Ford Motor Co. franchises accounted for 46 of the dealerships,
while General Motors Corp. accounted for 26 and Chrysler Corp. 15.
   The nation's biggest black-owned car dealership was Shack-Woods
&amp; Associates of Long Beach, Calif., whose sales jumped 42.7 percent
last year to $127 million.
   California led all states with 22 of the companies belonging to
one or the other of the two top-100 lists. New York and Michigan
had 20 apiece, followed by Illinois and Ohio with 13 apiece.
   To make the list, companies had to be at least 51 percent
black-owned.

   A heavy debt load, antitrust laws and
possible labor conflict could be sticking points for
financially-troubled Pan Am Corp. if it decides to bid for the
much-larger NWA Inc., the parent of Northwest Airlines and the
target of several other suitors.
   Pan Am, backed by Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. and an
investment group including members of Texas' Bass family, said
Tuesday it would consider making a buyout offer for NWA.
   Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett told a Washington news
conference that Prudential-Bache and the Airlie Group Ltd. were
considering providing significant new equity for Pan Am to make an
acquisition possible. He did not provide any details.
   NWA said that Pan Am, the parent of Pan American World Airways,
stated in a letter that if it made a formal proposal, it likely
would be an all-cash offer.
   Pan Am's announcement was in response to NWA's general request
for buyout proposals, Plaskett said. NWA made the request afte
rejecting oil billionaire Marvin Davis' unsolicited $90-a-share, or
$2.7 billion, buyout offer.
   Another potential buyer for NWA is an investment group headed by
Los Angeles investor Al Checchi.
   Pan Am's limited contact with Northwest has been ``cordial and
friendly,'' Plaskett said.
   Plaskett said in February that Pan Am, with nearly $1 billion in
debts, would need to find a merger partner or otherwise attract new
investment in order to survive. The New York-based company lost
$151.1 million in the first three months of 1989, $72.7 million in
all of 1988 and $265.3 million in 1987.
   By contrast, NWA, based in Eagan, Minn. reported first-quarter
earnings of $12.6 million, or 43 cents a share, and is one of the
country's most profitable airlines.
   A marriage of Pan Am and Northwest would create one of the
world's farthest-ranging airlines, joining Pan Am's strong Atlantic
and Latin American routes with Northwest's Pacific routes to the
Orient.
   But some analysts doubted that Pan Am, the eighth-largest U.S.
carrier, could successfully bid for No. 4 Northwest. Reaction on
Wall Street was cool with Pan Am stock rising 62{ cents a share to
$5 on the New York Stock Exchange and NWA falling 50 cents to
$104.25 a share.
   Kurt Rivard, an airline analyst for Dain Bosworth Inc. in
Minneapolis, said a merger of the two was plausible, but it could
be the kind of highly leveraged deal that Northwest's pilots and
machinists have said they would resist.
   The machinists have said they are interested in making their own
bid for Northwest. The pilots have an open contract and pose a
strike threat.
   ``The company (Pan Am) has a working capital deficiency,'' said
Mike Hamilton of Piper Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis.
``That's not the kind of situation that labor nor NWA managment is
eager to move into.''
   There also could be labor turbulence at Pan Am.
   William Genoese, head of the Teamsters local representing 5,300
Pan Am cargo, passenger service workers and stock clerks, said his
union could disrupt a possible bid by threatening to strike and
scaring away Pan Am's financial backers. The union is trying to
negotiate a new contract.
   ``We're the only ones who can strike Pan Am right now,'' Genoese
said. ``Wall Street won't give them money with an open contract.''
   Said Plaskett: ``We would expect employees of both companies to
be a very important part in our evaluation of whether or not to
proceed.''
   Charles Rule, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who formerly was in
charge of the antitrust division at the U.S. Justice Department,
said there is a chance the department would reject a Northwest-Pan
Am merger proposal on the grounds that it would weaken domestic
competition in the industry.
   But he said chances for approval would be increased if the two
carriers can prove their routes do not overlap.
   ``I wouldn't want to speculate as to what the conclusion is
going to be,'' Rule said.
   NWA said Pan Am had shown previous buyout interest but had not
signed a confidentiality agreement that NWA has required of all
suitors seeking non-public financial information. NWA Chairman
Steven Rothmeier said Northwest's board would consider Pan Am's
request for information.
   Pan Am will make an offer or back out by the June 2 deadline NWA
has set for offers, Plaskett said.
   Hamilton, the Piper Jaffray analyst, said a bid by Pan Am could
possibly be intended to lure NWA into a takeover of Pan Am.
   ``If I had to speculate in either direction it would be that Pan
Am is trying to get themselves into play,'' Hamilton said. ``Pan Am
has been looking for a merger partner for a while.''
   But Plaskett said he has no hidden agenda.
   ``What we think we bring to this transaction is something that a
pure financial investor cannot bring, the opportunity for revenue
and growth, for financial and cost synergies,'' Plaskett said.
``The combined carriers serve a total of 290 cities worldwide with
virtually no overlap, only eight duplicated routes between the two
carriers and no duplicated international route authority.''

   As a deadline for bids for strikebound Eastern
Airlines approached, one prospective buyer, Trans World Airlines
Inc., took itself out of the running at least for the time being.
   TWA said in a statement Tuesday it needed more time to discuss
with its unions the feasibility of integrating the two carriers'
workforces, and thus was not prepared to submit a formal bid for
Eastern at this time.
   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn, the owner and chairman of
TWA, has held numerous discussions with officials of Eastern's
unions and was widely expected to make a bid for the Miami-based
airline.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland has set a deadline of 5
p.m. EDT today for all interested bidders to submit offers for
Eastern or its lucrative Northeast shuttle service.
   Eastern has been under Chapter 11 protection from its creditors
since March 9, five days after the start of a Machinists union
strike that was supported by pilots and flight attendants. The sale
of the airline or any of its parts must be approved by the
bankruptcy court.
   Although TWA said it would not bid for the entire airline, it
reiterated it might submit an offer for Eastern's airport hub in
Philadelphia and said it might, ``from time to time, express an
interest in other assets of Eastern.''
   However, the airline said, ``Unless and until TWA's unions agree
..., TWA will not be able to make a bid for Eastern.''
   The issue of integrating the two unions and determining
seniority rankings has been an issue in discussions between Icahn
and Eastern's unions, according to sources close to the situation.
It is an especially sore point for the Eastern pilots, for whom
seniority is a more crucial issue than their fellow Machinists or
flight attendants, the sources said.
   Partly for that reason, the Eastern pilots union has appeared to
favor billionaire hotel mogul Jay Pritzker, who already has
submitted a formal bid for Eastern.
   ``We believe that the viable offers will come to the table by
tomorrow afternoon,'' said Dan Ashby, a spokesman in New York for
the Air Line Pilots Association.
   Other potential bidders include a group led by former airline
executive William Howard and investment firm Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., and another consortium led by Joseph Ritchie, a
prominent Chicago commodities trader.
   Developer Donald Trump has agreed to buy Eastern's profitable
shuttle service for $365 million, but the deal still awaits the
court's approval. America West Airlines last week offered $726
million for the shuttle routes and landing slots, along with 10
Boeing 757 jetliners.
   Eastern management insists the airline is not for sale and is
proceeding with a plan to rebuild as a smaller carrier and raise
$1.8 billion by selling aircraft and other assets.
   TWA's announcement reinforces Eastern's contention that there
are ``no bona fide bidders'' for the airline, said Art Kent, a
spokesman in Houston for Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.
   Icahn could be holding back on the assumption that no serious
offers will be made, and he could then pounce on Eastern, suggested
some sources who asked not to be identified by name.
   Others suggested he made the announcement Tuesday, rather than
today, the deadline day, to put pressure on the unions to reach
agreement with him and allow time for him to change his mind about
a bid.
   Some observers expect Icahn to bid for NWA Inc., the parent of
Northwest Airlines, which is the target of several takeover
suitors. Pan Am Corp. announced Tuesday it is considering an offer
for the much larger NWA.
   TWA General Counsel Mark Buckstein acknowledged the possibility
that TWA's unions might reach an accord with the airline in the
near future, and TWA might then ``seek an opportunity to bid''
after the judge's deadline. However, TWA would not submit a bid by
the deadline, Buckstein told The Associated Press.
   In a separate development Tuesday, Eastern and the American
Society of Travel Agents agreed on a proposed plan to reimburse
travel agents for cash refunds on Eastern tickets given to
customers before March 10. The plan must also be approved by the
bankruptcy court.

   Karl Brunner, an influential economist
and leading exponent of monetarism, has died after a long bout with
a spinal tumor.
   Brunner, who died Tuesday, was 73.
   Many economists credited the Swiss-born economist and other top
monetarists with steering the Federal Reserve System toward tight
controls on the money supply in the early 1980s, helping to halt
the inflation of the late 1970s.
   Monetarists believe government's only important role in the
economy is to regulate the money supply through a slow but steady
growth rate.
   ``Karl Brunner was a much valued leader of the intellectual
community in economics, with a truly international network of
academics, policy makers and business leaders as colleagues,'' said
Paul W. MacAvoy, dean of the University of Rochester's William E.
Simon Graduate School of Business Administration. Brunner had
taught at Rochester since 1971.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain regularly sought his
counsel, and Switzerland and Sweden used his advice to manage their
economies.
   Brunner grew up in Switzerland, the son of an astronomy
professor at the University of Zurich. He studied history there
after graduating from high school, and became fascinated by
economics.
   His studies were interrupted by World War II. He served as a
lieutenant in the Swiss army.
   Brunner received his doctorate in economics from Zurich in 1943,
and worked at the Swiss National Bank until 1949, when he studied
at Harvard University and the University of Chicago on a
Rockefeller fellowship.
   He taught at several universities before coming to Rochester,
and held a joint professorship at Rochester and the University of
Bern in Switzerland for most of his career.
   Brunner's wife, Rosmarie, died in 1986. He is survived by nieces
and nephews in Europe. A memorial service will be held in Rochester
on Saturday.

   Viacom Inc., charging that Time Inc. and its
cable television units are monopolizing pay-TV, has filed a $2.4
billion antitrust lawsuit seeking to loosen Time's grip on the
cable industry.
   Viacom, parent of the Showtime cable television channel, filed
its suit against Time and its Home Box Office and other cable TV
divisions in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
   Viacom charged Time and its TV holdings are monopolizing,
conspiring to monopolize and attempting to restrain trade,
practices prohibited by the federal Sherman and Clayton antitrust
acts.
   The suit contended the violations entitle Viacom to recover
three times the actual monetary damage done to it, an amount placed
at $800 million. After trebling, the amount sought in damages is
$2.4 billion.
   Time blasted Viacom's suit as baseless.
   ``Many of the allegations rehash issues that have been
periodically raised for more than a decade,'' stated Time, one of
the world's largest entertainment and publishing conglomerates.
``On several occasions, the Justice Department has reviewed many if
not all of these allegations and repeatedly concluded that no
action was warranted.''
   Viacom alleged that Time and its Home Box Office Inc., American
Television and Communications Corp. and Manhattan Cable Television
Inc. are ``engaging in an integrated series of predatory and
exclusionary acts and strategies designed to increase the costs of
their rivals, raise barriers to entry and expansion, and otherwise
entrench themselves as monopolists by anticompetitive conduct,
injuring the competitive process and ultimately, consumers,'' the
suit said.
   Among the numerous complaints listed, Viacom said HBO abuses its
position as the dominant firm in the business of providing pay TV
programming services.
   HBO holds about 65 percent of the nationwide market for these
services, a market share three times larger than its closest rival,
the suit said.
   These programming services are competing for access to national
and local markets. HBO's dominance allows it to undercut
competitions' prices to such an extent that competitors never
obtain a large enough subscriber base to survive, Viacom alleged.
   Viacom also asked the court to bar Time and its pay TV operators
from further allegedly anticompetitive behavior.
   Time vice president for corporate communications Louis J.
Slovinsky said Viacom's Showtime unit actually engages in some of
the practices that it has criticized HBO about in the suit. For
instance, both HBO and Showtime have negotiated exclusive contracts
with studios for films, according to Slovinsky.
   Also, he said Time is puzzled why Viacom has decided to launch
the legal salvo at this point.
   ``This is the kind of suit they could have brought any time in
the past 10 years. Why are they doing it now?'' Slovinsky said.
   He noted that the issues specified in the suit have been
examined thoroughly. Most recently, they were addressed when the
government reviewed the antitrust implications of the proposed $18
billion merger between Time and Warner Communications Inc., he said.
   A completed merger would make Time Warner the world's largest
media concern, with projected annual revenue of $10 billion, and in
all likelihood increase the combined company's clout in every field
in which it operates.
   Viacom said that more than a year was spent preparing the legal
action against Time, indicating it was not prompted by the
Time-Warner merger announcement in March.
   Slovinsky said Time will contest the many charges Viacom has
leveled and he predicted vindication.
   ``This is a suit that includes the kitchen sink and the coffee
grounds,'' he said.

<HEAD>Texaco Shareholders Endorse Anti-Takeover Plan</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Texaco Inc. have approved a new
``poison pill'' to protect the oil company from unwanted takeover
attempts.
   The poison pill, also known as a shareholder rights plan, was
one of several company-backed measures approved Tuesday at the
Texaco annual meeting. Three proposals opposed by the Texaco board
_ two urging the company to curtail its operations in South Africa
and one to make proxy votes confidential _ were rejected.
   A shareholder vote on a poison pill is rare. But Texaco agreed
to the vote after shareholders handed the company a victory in a
proxy fight a year ago with takeover strategist Carl Icahn.
   The pill had been a point of contention between Texaco and
Icahn, its largest stockholder, until they settled their
differences aside in late January.
   The anti-takeover plan entitles stockholders to buy additional
shares of common stock at a considerable discount within 10 days of
the announcement that a suitor had acquired 20 percent or more of
Texaco common stock without meeting certain conditions.
   The plan's intent is to dilute the value of the suitor's
interest and increase the cost of making the offer.
   The Texaco plan, however, would not be triggered if an offer for
the company was considered by the board of directors to be ``a bona
fide, fully financed, all-cash offer and meets other conditions.''
The takeover offer also would have to give the board reasonable
time to explore other opportunities.
   The plan was approved Tuesday by 84.2 percent of the shares
voting, said Texaco spokeswoman Anita Larsen. Texaco has 250
million shares of common stock outstanding.
   Other proposals approved by shareholders included two special
dividends worth about $2 billion, an employee compensation plan
tied to performance, the hiring of a new auditor and the election
of five directors.
   The meeting Tuesday marked the first time officials of the White
Plains, N.Y.-based company faced the shareholders since Texaco
launched its post-bankruptcy restructuring.
   Texaco, the nation's third-largest oil company, asked a federal
bankruptcy court in 1987 to protect it from claims by its
creditors. The move followed a $10.3 billion judgment won against
Texaco by Pennzoil Co., which charged Texaco with blocking
Pennzoil's plans to acquire Getty Oil Co.
   Texaco emerged from bankruptcy protection last year and launched
a restructuring program that included the projected sale of more
than $5 billion in operating assets. In February, the company
completed the sale of Texaco Canada Inc. to Imperial Oil Ltd. for
$3.24 billion.
   ``After several years of some very special challenges, a new
Texaco has emerged _ a company with its own vision for greatness, a
company with its sights set firmly on the future,'' Texaco Chairman
Alfred C. DeCrane told the shareholders Tuesday.
   DeCrane and James W. Kinnear, Texaco's president and chief
executive officer, served up large helpings of optimism for the
attentive, if low-key, gathering.
   The officials said the company is in good financial health and
is poised to reclaim its position as an industry leader. Noting the
recent Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, Kinnear also stressed that
Texaco is committed to preventing another environmental disaster.

   America's biggest industry _ electronics
_ still leads Japan and the rest of the world, but not by much.
   Japan produced $250 billion worth of electronic goods in 1988 _
everything from computer chips to copiers and facsimile machines _
while the United States barely stayed ahead with $262.8 billion,
the research firm Dataquest Inc. said Tuesday in an annual industry
analysis and forecast.
   As the high-tech industry heads into the 1990s, it is
experiencing a shifting balance of power, said Manny A. Fernandez,
president of the San Jose-based firm.
   The rapid growth of Japan and the rest of Asia not only enlarged
the world's market for electronics products, but reduced American
and European shares of that market, Fernandez said.
   The move toward a unified European market in 1992 will put
further pressure on American manufacturers, Fernandez said,
although he noted that `` `Fortress Europe' is a fear, not _ at
least yet _ a fact.''
   ``All manufacturers worldwide must take the longer term view and
make the commitment necessary to be true global players, both
operationally and technologically, in Europe,'' he said.
   The globalization of the electronics marketplace is here to
stay, Fernandez said, and companies no longer can afford to
manufacture in just one country and sell everywhere else.
   ``This year we have seen some incredible things take place,''
said Fernandez, who called Japan's surge toward the top in overall
electronics production more signficant than its recent dominance of
the semiconductor industry.
   Apple Computer Inc. passed International Business Machines Corp.
in unit sales of personal computers in the United States in 1988,
Fernandez said. But the big news in that arena, he said, was the
penetration into the U.S. market of Korean and Taiwanese computer
makers.
   On a day when Apple announced new software and IBM unveiled a
cheaper personal computer and a portable one, Dataquest said both
companies lost U.S. market share in 1988 to foreign vendors, whose
sales grew from 35 percent to 45 percent of the U.S. total.
   The personal computer market, which grew 27 percent worldwide to
$51.7 billion and 22 percent in the United States to $28.7 billion,
will continue to grow impressively in 1989, Dataquest said. Growth
in the U.S. market will be 25 percent in 1989, and 12.6 percent
compounded annually through 1993, the company said.
   Laptop computers will be the fastest growing part of that
market, said Fernandez.
   American companies will have to change their marketing
strategies, however, to recover lost market share, said Fernandez.
   ``The era when it was the technology strength of one giant
company against another, those days are pretty much over,''
Fernandez said. ``It has become a marketing game. It has become a
game of pricing, a game of software supply, service and
distribution channels.''
   Apple led U.S. personal computer makers by selling 1.27 million
units of its Macintosh and Apple II lines in 1988, while IBM sold
1.23 million units of all its personal computers, said Dataquest
vice president Steve J. Lair.
   That trend will reverse in 1989, however, according to Lair, who
predicts IBM personal computer sales of 1.48 million units and
Apple sales of 1.42 million units.
   ``IBM is finally getting its act together,'' said Lair, who
cited the company's new products and stronger marketing push.
   IBM pulled the plug on its PC-AT line prematurely and made a
mistake in focusing on technology instead of marketing over the
past year or two, Lair said.
   ``IBM was expecting U.S. industry to respond to technological
advancement, whereas corporate decision makers were really
interested in productivity,'' Lair said.
   Japanese personal computer makers sold 730,000 units in the
United States, while Taiwan, Korea and other Asian companies sold
1.03 million units. European companies accounted for another
133,000 in U.S. sales.
   The hottest electronics markets over the next five years will be
telecommunications, which Japan already dominates, as well as
software, business computer peripherals and workstations, said
Dataquest.
   The estimated U.S. revenue in the telecommunications market in
1988 was $152.6 billion, and is expected to rise to $159.5 billion
in 1989 and $191.3 billion by the end of 1993, Dataquest said.
   Among the big winners in that market will be cellular radios,
facsimile machines and data communications equipment, Fernandez
said.
   ``Fax had a hot year in 1988 and that marketplace grew an
incredible 78 percent to $1.8 billion,'' he said. ``No industry is
going to be capable, at the $2 billion level, of maintaining that
kind of growth. But fax business is going to grow in 1989 another
14.6 percent to $2 billion, and then 12 percent every year after
that through 1993 to a new high of $3.2 billion.''
   By the end of this year, more than 105 million personal
computers will be in use around the world, creating a huge market
for add-ons, software and other related items, said Fernandez.
   Personal computer software sales totaled $9.3 billion in North
America in 1988, and are expected to rise to $10.7 billion in 1989
and $19.3 billion by the end of 1993.
   In what Dataquest called ``one of the great boom years for the
worldwide chip business,'' the overall semiconductor industry grew
32 percent in 1988. The industry posted $16 billion in sales in
North America in 1988, and is expected to grow to $18.3 billion
this year and $33.3 billion by the end of 1993.
   Worldwide chip consumption will grow 15.3 percent in 1989,
Dataquest said. Workstations also will be a high-growth area,
taking a bite out of the minicomputer market and putting pressure
on personal computers, said Fernandez. The proposed merger of
Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apollo Computer Inc. announced recently is
just the beginning of a continuing restructuring of the workstation
segment of the industry, he said.

<DATELINE>TIFTON, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. peanut consumption has jumped 10.8
percent since last year _ proof that good old goobers are becoming
a posh and fashionable food, Georgia's top peanut official says.
   A U.S. Department of Agriculture report said Americans are
eating 18 percent more peanut butter, 7.2 percent more salted nuts
and 1.2 percent more candy bars.
   ``We hope there aren't lots of folks out there who aren't eating
peanuts,'' said Don Koehler, executive director of the Georgia
Peanut Commission. ``But for those who aren't eating enough: we've
got a product that's gained a lot of acceptance.''
   Koehler said the USDA figures demonstrate the effectiveness of
the industry's promotional programs. The report, released on April
27, compares the first eight months of the peanut marketing year to
the same period a year earlier.
   ``At that kind of growth rate, we could be looking at $85
million in added sales for producers nationwide,'' Koehler said.
   To keep pace with increases in consumption and to maintain
stable prices and supplies, the USDA increased the national peanut
quota to 1.44 million tons this year from 1.4 million tons last
year.
   Koehler is particularly pleased about the 1.2 percent increase
in candy consumption.
   ``Candy has been kind of flat,'' he said in a recent interview.
``It seems we live in a health-conscious society that worries about
that (eating sweets). Folks are beginning to say, `Wait a minute,
everybody is overkilling ... food safety, food quality and what's
good to eat.' Once in a while, you just like a candy bar.''
   Another reason for the increase in consumption is cost, he said,
noting that peanut prices traditionally lag behind the consumer
price index for food.
   ``You can't buy bologna or hot dogs or any other protein source
nearly as cheap as you can peanuts,'' he said.
   The Peanut Commission spends more than $1 million annually to
promote the state's top cash crop and cooperates with similar
groups in Florida and Alabama in funding the Peanut Advisory Board.
   One of the industry's most successful promotional programs has
been the Adults-only Peanut Butter Club, sponsored by the board.
   ``I think ... we have made it acceptable again for adults to eat
peanut butter,'' he said. ``It's not just kids' food any more.
We're around 40,000 members and they just keep coming in.''
   This year, the commission is focusing on tourists who drive
through the state. The newest official Georgia maps at highway
welcome centers have a picture of a peanut on one side and peanut
information on the back.
   Georgia growers, who produce nearly half of the nation's
peanuts, devoted 688,000 acres to the crop last year.
   To provide more money for promotion, the advisory board's
headquarters was moved from New York to Atlanta, where operating
costs should be about 20 percent less, said Koehler.
   ``We brought it to the peanut belt,'' he said. ``We felt it was
a move we needed to make. We found we could do an equally effective
job in Atlanta and probably an ever more effective job.''
   Nearly all the peanuts grown in Georgia are a type known as
``runners.'' Runners account for 80.1 percent of all the peanuts in
candy, 64.4 percent of all salted nuts and 75.7 percent of all
peanut butter cookies and crackers. In addition, runners comprise
86.5 percent of all peanuts used in peanut butter.
   ``I think people have accepted peanuts as being a good food, and
though they're reasonably priced, we like to think of them as a
posh, in-vogue food,'' he said. ``We just want people to get out
there and eat peanuts and know we're going to keep growing them
down here.''

<HEAD>Former Gruntal Stockbroker Gets 24 Months</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Gruntal &amp; Co. executive Robert Chestman
was sentenced to two years in prison for insider trading and
perjury and ordered to pay about $250,000 by a judge who wanted
``to send a message to Wall Street.''
   ``His actions corrupted the marketplace,'' said U.S. District
Judge John Walker Jr., ignoring pleas for leniency Tuesday from the
ex-stockbroker and his attorney.
   ``Those who cheat the markets out of greed must pay a price for
their conduct,'' the judge said.
   Chestman, 41, put his chin on his folded arms and his wife,
Susan, sobbed as Walker passed sentence.
   A former Gruntal first vice president from the Long Island
community of Lawrence, Chestman was convicted March 14 by a federal
court jury of all counts in a 31-count indictment.
   Walker, who could have sentenced Chestman to a maximum five
years in prison on each count and fined him as much as $500,000,
also ordered him to pay about $250,000 in restitution, the final
amount to be determined by the Probation Department and the U.S.
attorney's office.
   Chestman was convicted of making more than $250,000 in illegal
profits in November 1986 by trading Waldbaum Inc. stock with inside
information that the New York-area supermarket chain was about to
be sold to rival chain A&amp;P.
   According to evidence at trial, Chestman obtained the non-public
information from one of his clients, Keith Loeb, who was related by
marriage to Waldbaum president Ira Waldbaum. Loeb avoided
prosecution by agreeing to testify for the government.
   In addition to 20 counts of securities fraud and 10 counts of
mail fraud, Chestman also was convicted of a single perjury count
for lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission in April 1987
about his insider dealings with Loeb.
   Noting the perjury conviction, Walker dismissed defense lawyer
Elkan Abramowitz's claim that Chestman's illegal activity was ``one
single aberrational incident.''
   ``This was not a single occurrence. This was an ongoing
situation,'' said Walker, adding: ``He then compounded his crimes''
by lying to the SEC.
   Abramowitz asked Walker to sentence his client to ``almost
anything but straight jail time.'' Noting that Chestman was under
psychiatric care and was his family's sole support, the defense
lawyer added that Chestman not only lost ``a well-paying job, but
more importantly, he's lost his career.''
   Under the terms of his conviction, Chestman will be barred
permanently from the securities industry.
   In a choked, sniffling voice, Chestman asked Walker to be
lenient because ``the agony and the pain that my wife and my
children and my mother and myself have suffered is unimaginable.''
   Chestman remained free without bail pending appeal.

<HEAD>Boeing Close to 747-400 Delivery Schedule</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENTON, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. is close to a revised production
schedule for the new 747-400 jumbojet but will negotiate late
delivery penalties with at least four customers, a company
executive said.
   Phil Condit, Boeing Commercial Airplanes executive vice
president, also predicted Tuesday the long-range jetliner would be
certified for a second engine type next week and for a third next
month.
   With 747-400 deliveries initially set to begin late last year,
Boeing executives said in October wiring problems would delay
delivery of the first 20 jets.
   A second delay was announced in December when initial
certification by the Federal Aviation Administration took longer
than expected.
   In January, Boeing officials spent five days ``readjusting'' the
747 production line at Everett, north of Seattle, and again
examined the production schedule. The line went through another
five-day readjustment in late March or early April to catch up work
that had fallen out of sequence, said Commercial Airplanes
spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese.
   The 747-400, which can carry 412 passengers more than 8,000
miles nonstop, is an extensively updated version of a model first
introduced in 1968. The new plane has a computerized cockpit
designed for a crew of two instead of three, is built with advanced
materials and has a larger wing.
   Condit and other Boeing officials acknowledge they may have been
overly ambitious in trying to bring out essentially four new
747-400s at once _ three different engine types, plus a ``combi''
version of the airframe that can carry freight on the upper deck.
In addition, they said each airline wants planes customized to
different needs.
   ``We took on a real task up there at Everett in terms of three
different engine certs, a combi, 18 customers in the first year,
and we didn't do was well as we would have liked,'' Condit said.
   ``We're holding very close to the plans that we laid out in
January,'' he said. ``It's not perfect, to be honest with you. We
missed by a couple of days, but overall I'm happy with how things
are going.''
   Boeing's latest schedule has been withheld, but Commercial
Airplanes spokeswoman Deane Darling said five 747-400s have been
delivered _ three to Northwest Airlines and two to Singapore
Airlines, all powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
   Approximately a dozen more 747-400s have been built and are
undergoing final preparation before delivery, Ms. Reese said.
   Condit said he expected the plane to be certified with General
Electric engines next week, with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Lufthansa getting the first two, the sixth and seventh off the line.
   Certification with Rolls-Royce engines should occur next month,
with Cathay Pacific and British Airways getting the first of those
models, Condit said.
   The first 747-400 Combi is to be delivered in early fall to KLM.
   Four 747-400s were delivered as of March 31, Ms. Darling said. A
greater number should be delivered in the second quarter, but ``I'm
not going to go beyond that at this point,'' Condit said.
   Boeing chairman Frank Shrontz has said he hopes for production
of 57 747s this year, including other models, but added there was
``significant risk'' in that forecast because more than half those
planes are scheduled for delivery in the last three months of the
year.
   Several airlines, including Northwest and KLM, have called for
compensation for late deliveries.
   ``We have contracts with a whole number of airlines that we have
not met,'' Condit said, ``and so clearly, like any good business,
when you don't meet your contract, you sit down and reach an
agreement on how you're going to settle that.''
   Without saying what how the compensation might be made, Condit
said Boeing would negotiate a settlement with Northwest, Lufthansa,
KLM and Singapore Airlines ``on an airline-by-airline basis.''

<TEXT>
   Mexico's inflation rate was 1.5 percent
during April, the lowest monthly level in nearly 10 years, Banco de
Mexico said.
   The central bank said prices rose 19.2 percent from April 1988
through last month.
   The announcement Tuesday said last month's inflation rate was
the lowest since November 1979.
   The government froze wages, prices and the peso exchange rate
Feb. 29, 1988 in a bid to curb inflation that reached a record
159.2 percent in 1987.
   Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent last year under the plan.
   Although inflation is now under control, workers whose wages
lagged behind price rises have gone on strike recently. In the past
few weeks, teachers and bus drivers have walked off the job
demanding higher pay hikes than the government was willing to offer.

<HEAD>State, City Officials Make Bid To Keep Retailer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAULINE JELINEK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governor James R. Thompson and Mayor Richard M.
Daley made what they called a competitive bid to Sears, Roebuck and
Co. executives in an effort to keep more than 6,000 jobs in Chicago.
   The two officials met Tuesday evening in a closed-door session
at Sears Tower with Sears Chairman Edward A. Brennan and other
company executives to discuss the planned relocation of the
retailer's Merchandise Group.
   ``We are going to be competitive with other cities across the
country,'' Daley said in a press conference with Thompson after
they left the world's tallest building. ``They're very aggressive,
other cities and states.
   ``I think some of the states would give their whole state to
Sears just to land (it) there,'' Daley said.
   In a major reorganization plan announced last autumn, Sears said
it would sell the 110-story Sears Tower and find less costly
facilities for the Merchandise Group, which operates Sears' retail
store and catalog division.
   State and city officials since then have pledged to use whatever
economic incentives are necessary not to lose the retailer, whose
$50 billion revenue last year nearly tripled the state's.
   Daley said it would be ``devastating'' for Chicago if Sears
moved out of the city.
   Thompson said Sears still is considering ``a number'' of sites,
both inside and outside the state.
   He said Illinois was preparing a ``very aggressive ... package''
to keep the company in the state and that it would be ``equally
applicable'' whether Sears decided to stay in Chicago or move to
another Illinois town.
   ``I wanted to assure the chairman...that if the city of
Chicago's package was one they chose, the state would be a very
aggressive partner with the city,'' Thompson said.
   Thompson and Daley declined to give any details of the package,
which is expected to include tax breaks, land writedowns,
transportation improvements and other incentives.
   Daley said ``there was a number of sites offered.'' Reports have
circulated in the last week that Sears was eyeing a site near
Chicago's O'Hare International Airport as well as several suburban
locations.
   ``I think we're highly competitive and we have a good proposal
by the state and by the city to keep them here,'' Daley said.
   Brennan confirmed the meeting took place, but declined to
comment further on what deadlines Sears has for the headquarters
search. Brennan and other Sears officials are expected to meet the
media Thursday when the retailer holds its annual shareholders
meeting.
   Sears officials still maintain that Chicago is the best choice
for a relocation site for the Merchandise Group's 6,700 employees,
although they are also looking outside the area.
   Thompson called Dallas and Charlotte, N.C. ``big tough
competitors'' for the Sears site.
   Brennan didn't attend the news conference and the governor and
mayor declined to say whether the company has given them a deadline
by which any proposals must be completed.
   Sears is the state's largest employer, with a total of almost
30,000 employees.

   Overestimating future sales and the value of its
assets when it went private led to the demise of Fruehauf Corp.,
which sold the last of its holdings to keep bill collectors at bay,
analysts say.
   The ultimate failure of the leveraged buyout attempted by the
world's largest maker of truck trailers could foreshadow trouble
for other companies still trying to pay off debts incurred through
restructuring, analysts said Tuesday.
   In Fruehauf's case, the leveraged buyout led to liquidation and
the end of a 75-year-old company once among the top 200
manufacturing companies in the nation.
   The projections on which Fruehauf based its leveraged buyout may
have been fantasy, said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic
forecasting at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   ``When you're dealing with the trucking industry, (projecting)
five years without a downturn is absurd,'' Ratajczak said.
   Fruehauf borrowed $1.5 billion to restructure itself in 1986 in
the face of a hostile takeover attempt by investor Asher Edelman.
   ``The trailer business turned much too slow for them. They
overpaid when they took it private,'' said Rolf W. Wagner, an
analyst with Scott &amp; Stringfellow in Richmond, Va.
   The sale of Fruehauf's Kelsey-Hayes division, which produces
auto and truck wheels, will bring in $66 million in cash and $430
million in notes. Kelsey-Hayes is the company's last significant
asset.
   Analysts at Roney &amp; Co. in Detroit said it is doubtful Fruehauf
management profited from the liquidation. However, Merrill Lynch,
which handled the sale of various Fruehauf divisions and
subsidiaries, received a windfall in fees and stock, said Tony
Viscogliosi, a Roney analyst who has followed Fruehauf for the past
2{ years.
   ``They've gotten six times their original investment in Class A
shares'' by selling the company off piecemeal, he said.
   Merrill Lynch spokesmen in New York did not return phone for
comment.
   Ratajczak said investment companies are calling the shots in the
leveraged buyout game.
   ``The truth is, it's being motivated out of downtown Manhattan.
There's a network of these firms out there trying to convince
companies they're worth more by restructuring. After the fees are
through, these guys are out of there,'' he said.
   Fruehauf's peddling of assets began in 1987 with the sale of its
fleet of 5,000 leased trailers. If the sale of Kelsey-Hayes to
Varity of Toronto goes through, only Fruehauf's nameplate on its
trucks will remain.
   Also in 1987, Fruehauf sold its international and domestic
trailer rental operations, financial subsidiary, aerospace unit,
heavy-duty auto group, 91 percent of its interest in Fruehauf of
Canada, 60 percent of its European trailer operations.
   Last year, it sold off the balance of its trailer manufacturing
operations _ its founding and main business segment _ and its
maritime operations, which included two ship yards, and its heavy
crane manufacturing and heavy cargo handling equipment.
   ``It was clear that they were selling their businesses to pay
down their debt to survive,'' Viscogliosi said.

   Though no one knows who invented the original
Hostess cupcake, there's no question D.R. ``Doc'' Rice improved the
treat.
   Rice, 83, injected the creme filling and put the squiggly white
line atop the cupcake's chocolate icing at Continental Baking Co.'s
Detroit plant. He was to return to Detroit today to celebrate the
cupcake's 70th birthday.
   The original cupcake from Hostess came out May 10, 1919. It was
made of devil's food cake and hand-covered with vanilla or
chocolate icing.
   Wartime rationing had restricted the amount and quality of some
ingredients, especially sugar and chocolate. Rice's changes led to
the widespread popularity of the snack.
   Hostess, owned by St. Louis-based Continental Baking, sold 400
million cupcakes last year.

<HEAD>Prediction: Japan's Procurement Of Foreign Chips To Reach 18 Percent
In 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's procurement of foreign-made semiconductors
will fall 2 percent short of the U.S. target of 20 percent of the
Japanese market by 1991, a major Japanese economic newspaper said
Wednesday.
   The Nihon Keizai Shimbun made the prediction based on annual
chip consumption by 40 major Japanese users in value terms in 1988.
They also looked at the companies' own estimates of their chip
purchases in 1991.
   The 40 companies surveyed, including electronics, auto-parts,
precision instrument and other manufacturing firms, account for
about 60 percent of the nation's total consumption annually, the
newspaper said. It said with the survey it could judge the
country's overall market-share trends.
   U.S. officials maintain that under a 1986 U.S.-Japan
semiconductor trade pact, Japan promised to increase its foreign
chip market to about 20 percent in 1991. Japanese officials say
there was no such promise.
   The share of foreign semiconductor sales in Japan stood at 10.6
percent in the fourth quarter of 1988, according to figures by the
World Semiconductor Trade Statistics.

   Growing impatience in the United States over trade
imbalances with Japan has created a need for new solutions, the
chief of American Express Co. said Wednesday.
   ``The atmosphere in which U.S. trade policy is formulated is
becoming increasingly difficult. Pressure is growing, especially in
the Congress, for new trade strategies to achieve quicker
results,'' said James D. Robinson III, who is also chairman of the
Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations.
   ``Old remedies to alter the trade imbalance haven't worked,''
Robinson told reporters at the Japan National Press Club.
   American firms, disappointed with a lack of progress in
penetrating Japan's market, also have increased pressure for faster
results in trade negotiations, said Robinson, American Express's
chairman and chief executive.
   ``The mood in the business community is changing. ... Companies
are not finding the opportunities they expected. ... So, they are
becoming increasingly active and vocal in criticizing barriers to
sales in Japan,'' Robinson said.
   While U.S. efforts to reduce trade imbalances with European
nations through exchange rate manipulations and other methods have
begun to work, the trade deficit with Japan remains stubbornly
high, Robinson said.
   In 1988, the United States posted a $52 billion trade deficit
with Japan, down slightly from the $59.8 billion deficit in 1987,
according to U.S. figures.
   Japan tops the list of 34 countries that U.S. Trade
Representative Carla Hills, in a recent report, said have erected
significant trade barriers against U.S. products. If negotiations
fail to eliminate trade barriers the United States deems unfair,
those nations could become targets for trade sanctions.
   Adding to pressure for trade action is a popular belief that
Japanese investors are ``buying up America,'' Robinson said. ``Many
Amerians see Japan as a threat to the United States.''
   He added: ``The erroneous public perception and related
emotional backlash clearly must be addressed.''
   To help ease public concern, Japanese corporations should avoid
concentrating their investment in specific areas and should do more
to demonstrate a sense of corporate responsibility and commitment
to American communities, Robinson said.
   Robinson suggested using business-to-business dialogue to tackle
difficult ``informal trade barriers such as the wholesale and
retail distribution system and traditional sourcing patterns.''
   ``It's time for our two business communities to work together to
identify practical ways of addressing unsustainable imbalances,''
he said.
   ``I believe, very strongly, that business leadership ... can
make a positive contribution to resolving issues before they become
issues that require action and retaliation,'' he said.

   The stock market was lower in early trading
today, with the market focused on day two of the Treasury's
quarterly refunding.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 1.10 points to
2,370.23 a half-hour after trading at 10 a.m. EDT.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 6 to 5 on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 490 issues down, 409 up and 555

   Volume on the Big Board totaled 21.59 million shares.
   ``Just as yesterday, the market will be dominated by the
Treasury refunding,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   On Tuesday, stock and bond prices nosedived in response to the
government's sale of three-year notes. Analysts said investors were
concerned that U.S. and foreign investors bought fewer of the notes
than expected.
   ``So there is concern that the 10-year note sale won't go well
either,'' Wachtel said.
   The final day of the sale is Thursday, when the government will
auction 30-year bonds.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks had

<TEXT>
   F.W. Woolworth Co. said Wednesday its
first-quarter earnings edged up 2.9 percent, restrained by the
impact of rising interest rates, higher short-term borrowings and
the cost of opening new stores.
   The New York-based retailer reported earnings of $36 million, or
56 cents a share, in the three months ended April 29, up from $35
million, or 54 cents a share, in the corresponding 1988 quarter.
   ``As anticipated, higher interest rates and higher average
levels of short-term borrowings put pressure on our first quarter
net income,'' said Harold E. Sells, Woolworth chairman and chief
executive officer.
   ``Higher depreciation expense due principally to the record
number of specialty stores opened in 1988 also impacted first
quarter results,'' he stated in a prepared announcement.
   He said interest and depreciation expenses as a percentage of
net income are expected to decline during the rest of the year.
   Woolworth's revenue grew 9 percent to $1.88 billion in the first
quarter from $1.72 billion a year earlier.
   Besides the Woolworth general merchandise stores, Woolworth has
many specialty retail holdings, including Foot Locker, Lady Foot
Locker and Kinney shoe stores.

   Congressional critics of the FSX warplane deal
told a Senate panel today that the United States would get the
worst of the bargain in sharing with Japan technology used for
America's F-16 fighter.
   ``The evidence before us is that we're really not getting
anything in return,'' Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., said in testimony
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
   Advocates of the FSX agreement, which involves co-producing an
advance version of the F-16, have said the United States would gain
access to Japanese composite wing construction and phased array
radar technologies.
   But Dixon said a study by the General Accounting Office, an
investigative arm of Congress, has found that U.S. companies
already have such technologies.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., called the arguments on the
technology flowback from Japan ``total nonsense and a facade to
cover up the shortcomings of this deal.''
   The FSX deal was strongly defended at the hearing by a panel of
senior Bush administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
Robert Mosbacher.
   ``I am confident that this agreement will not harm the economic
security interests of the United States,'' Mosbacher said.
   The comments came on the second day of congresssional hearings
on the FSX deal.
   ``We will teach the premier Japanese aerospace firm how to build
a world-class fighter, something they cannot do today,'' Rep. Mel
Levine, D-Calif., said at one session Tuesday. ``It is a fact that
enhancing the capabilities of one's competitors will, by
definition, decrease one's technological lead.''
   ``Beyond the issue, there is so much wrapped up symbolically,''
said Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. ``It is clear to me what the people of
Indiana want ... They have a deep, deep mistrust of the Japanese.''
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee and three House Foreign
Affairs subcommittees scheduled additional hearings today.
   President Bush last month approved a $7 billion agreement under
which the United States and Japan would co-produce an advanced
version of the F-16 fighter.
   The agreement calls for the United States to transfer designs
for the F-16, developed by General Dynamics, to Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries, Japan's prime contractor.
   The United States had urged Japan to buy the F-16s, but the
Asian nation said it wanted to build a new fighter on its own. The
Defense and State departments then pushed for a co-production deal.
   Lawmakers in the House and Senate have introduced resolutions to
disapprove the deal. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., introduced a
resolution of approval Tuesday.
   ``The haunting question is, why won't they buy our planes?''
said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., at a hearing of Senate Armed
Services subcommittee on defense industry and technology. ``We buy
their cars, TVs, radios, VCRs.''
   Senators expressed concerns about how much technology the United
States will provide and how it will benefit Japan in the aerospace
industry. Witnesses from the State, Defense and Commerce
departments sought to assure the lawmakers that the United States
will not be giving away all its secrets and will retain safeguards.
   ``What we're providing to Japan was built in 1975, 1978. It's
not current state of the art,'' said Lt. Gen. Ronald W. Yates,
principal deputy to the assistant secretary of the Air Force for
acquisition.
   Yates said the only updated equipment are engines and avionics.
The United States will sell the engines but not allow Japan to copy
the technology. Japan will develop its own avionics, Yates said.
   Carl W. Ford, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific Affairs, noted that the FSX deal was made in the
interest of U.S. national security.
   ``Any suggestion that we are not in command about U.S.
production base couldn't be further from the truth,'' Ford said.
``... The FSX is our idea.''
   But Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., complained that any
``farsighted strategy to maintain our lead in aerospace'' is absent
in the FSX deal. Gore noted that at the same time the United States
is working with Japan on an advanced fighter jet, funding for the
National Aerospace Plane may be cut. The high-speed transport, a
joint project with NASA, could fly around the world in just two
hours.
   But Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed slashing the
project's fiscal 1990 budget from $300 million to $100 million.
   Gore also cautioned that rejection of the Japan deal would leave
the United States with ``serious ongoing disputes with two major
allies'' _ West Germany, which does not want to modernize
short-range missiles, and Japan.
   In the House, Levine; Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.; and Helen Delich
Bentley, R-Md., urged support for the disapproval resolution at a
hearing before the Senate Foreign Affairs subcommittees on Asian
and Pacific affairs, arms control international security and
science, and international economic policy and trade.

   Stock prices were relatively unchanged in slow
trading today, with the market remaining in a cautious mode.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 0.73 to

   Brokers said the market's early focus was on the bond market and
the second day of the Treasury's three-day quarterly borrowing.
   ``Just as yesterday, the market will be dominated by the
Treasury refunding,'' said Larry Wachtel, analyst with
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   On Tuesday, stock and bond prices fell in response to the
government's sale of three-year notes. Analysts said investors were
concerned that U.S. and foreign investors bought fewer of the notes
than expected.
   ``So there is concern that the 10-year note sale won't go well
either,'' Wachtel said.
   The final day of the sale is Thursday, when the government will
auction 30-year bonds.
   Traders said the market also is remaining cautious ahead of
economic reports this week expected to show strong economic growth
and higher inflation that could drive up interest rates.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Narrowly Mixed In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices were narrowly
mixed in early trading this morning on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Wheat futures were down slightly amid disappointment that the
Agriculture Department has become more conservative in subsidizing
wheat export sales.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter told the House Agriculture
Committee today in Washington that the government must be cautious
in awarding subsidies for sales of wheat from existing stockpiles,
although Yeutter said the USDA would use the export bonus program
aggressively for sales of new-crop wheat.
   Corn and soybean futures opened higher in line with strong cash
markets, but soybeans quickly turned lower on perceptions of
improved growing conditions in the Midwest.
   Although recent rains have dampened fears of a second
consecutive year of drought in the Corn Belt, some parts of
southern Iowa remain so dry that the National Guard is carrying
drinking water to parched communties.
   In early trading, wheat was } cent lower to 1{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at $4.25{ a bushel; corn was }
cent lower to 1{ cents higher with May at $2.79 a bushel; oats were
unchanged to { cent higher with May at $1.89 a bushel; soybeans
were 2 cents lower to 1\ cents higher with May at $7.65{ a bushel.
   Pork futures were higher while cattle futures were mostly lower
in early trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .12 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at
72.30 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 cent lower
with May at 76.95 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent lower to
.23 cent higher with June at 48.15 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.18 cents to 1.70 cents higher with May at 35.50
cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Tuesday with pork
bellies up sharply on strong technical signals.

<HEAD>Sue Brokerage Over Collapsed Calif. Thrift</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal regulators said today they've sued
Wall Street brokerage Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. and a California-based
investment group for $24 million over activities linked to the
failure of a savings and loan.
   The civil complaint of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance
Corp., filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that
the insolvency of Seapointe Savings and Loan in Carlsbad, Calif.,
was the result of the defendants' violation of laws and regulations
governing trading by S&amp;Ls in securities, futures and commodity
options, as well as breaches of duty.
   Also named in the suit were Strategic Investment Services;
Robert Peacock, an account manager at Kidder, Peabody; Dirk Rose,
president of SIS; and Robert Forrest, a director of SIS.
   The complaint charges that, rather than hedging to protect
Seapointe's assets, the trading conducted by Kidder, Peabody and
SIS amounted to risky speculation.
   In addition, the regulators charged that the defendants knew
that Seapointe's directors were inexperienced in securities,
futures and commodity options trading, and that SIS made
representations to further its own interests without regard to
those of Seapointe Savings.
   Kidder, Peabody allegedly abetted SIS by failing to warn
Seapointe of SIS's fraudulent acts, according to the complaint.
   On May 30, 198l replied: ``In one year, he will speak English very
well.''
   ``A real interesting diplomatic challenge,'' Steger called it.
   Other international support includes the use of China's Great
Wall Station on King George Island as a staging point. New
Zealanders stationed at the Scott McArdle base donated 12 dogs
whose lineage can be traced to dogs owned by polar explorer Richard
Byrd. The Soviet Union provided an icebreaker to transport 15 tons
of food for the men and 36 dogs; the provisions were cached on the
route in November. The USSR also plans to send a military cargo
plane to pick up the team from its rendezvous at Steger's Minnesota
camp; the U.S. State Department, while not officially sanctioning
the trek, is expected to let the plane land.
   After refueling in Cuba, the team will fly to the Great Wall
Base, about 600 miles south of the tip of South America. The
expedition, which will set out in the middle of the Austral winter,
will at first follow known landmarks.
   ``We'll have maps for the first 1,500 miles. The last 2,500
miles there is virtually nothing. It's flat. There's nothing to
map,'' Steger said.
   They'll cross the Ellsworth Mountains and skirt Mt. Vinson, the
continent's highest spot at 16,860 feet. They'll visit three
American bases _ Palmer, Siple and Amundsen-Scott at the South
Pole, where they plan to celebrate Christmas.
   The next dot of civilization they'll aim for is the Soviet base
at Vostok, near the magnetic south pole. Vostok, the coldest place
on Earth, will serve as a base for a French documentary film crew
that will travel with the expedition for three weeks, and for the
team's pilot.
   By March, the trekkers should reach the Soviet base of Mirnyy on
the east coast, also known as Queen Mary Coast, ending the longest
possible traverse.
   They'll be picked up by the expedition ship, built in France
with a special aluminum hull designed to pop up and settle intact
on top of the ice rather than be trapped and crushed.
   So far, about 45 nations have signed television contracts with
the expedition. ABC has bought exclusive U.S. TV rights. ``We want
the world to know much, much more about Antarctica after our
expedition than it did before we set out,'' Steger said.
   The continent is roughly the shape of a bottle cap. It rises
sharply at the perimeter, then flattens out in a vast, high plateau
at an average elevation of 9,500 feet. Antarctica's 5.4 million
square miles is more than China and India combined. It has no
indigenous people, and wildlife is confined to the coast.
   A treaty signed in 1959 by a dozen nations, with additional
signatories in subsequent years, put all territorial claims on
Antarctica on hold, banned military activity and established
freedom of scientific inquiry.
   But many countries now have designs on the land for strategic,
political and even economic reasons _ some expect to find oil, coal
and mineral deposits under the ice. Some want to see the continent
cut into pie-shaped wedges, but Steger wants the people of the
world to demand that it be protected, intact.
   ``It sounds like a very lofty goal, but Antarctica is a going to
play a very important role in the future of the planet,'' he said.
   Planetary warming of just a few degrees could melt the polar ice
caps, raising sea level and flooding coastal areas, but Steger said
it's simplistic to worry about submerged cities. With 85 percent of
the planet's fresh water stored in the snow and ice of Antarctica,
a thaw would reduce the salinity of the oceans, change ocean
currents and wreak havoc with weather patterns.
   The other environmental nightmare awakening interest in
Antarctica is the discovery of a giant hole in the ozone layer
directly over the continent. Ozone screens the planet from excess
ultraviolet radiation.
   Scientists predict continued ozone depletion will increase skin
cancer, but such thinking is ``myopic,'' Steger said. Most
significantly, increased solar radiation could disrupt the
reproduction cycles of plankton, the microscopic oceanic plants and
animals that are the basis of the global food chain.
   These ominous changes are most apparent in Antarctica, making it
``like a canary in a mine,'' Steger said.
   The team will be under the ozone hole for about 40 days and 500
miles as they cross a 13,000-foot high plateau known as the Area of
Inaccessibility. It's the worst possible place on earth for
ultraviolet exposure.
   The team will carry a monitor and Boyarsky will record ozone
levels at regular intervals, the first cross-section of ozone
across the continent.
   Qin will take snow and ice samples all the way across
Antarctica, recording temperatures and oxygen content for a
geological history of the icecap.
   Etienne, a physician, will monitor cholesterol levels of the
team members, who will rely on the high-fat diet typical of
cultures in cold regions.
   But the experiments that can be done along the way are limited
by time and weight. The trekkers plan to travel 30 miles a day on
cross-country skis, and the three dogsleds can carry no more than
900 pounds of gear.
   Steger admits they won't attempt ``pure science'' but he hopes
the findings will contribute to the knowledge of this frontier.
``We need international cooperation. Solutions to environmental
problems must be global.''

<TEXT>
   Exxon Corp., under fire from
environmentalists and the government, announced today it will
sharply increase the number of workers and ships cleaning oil from
more than 300 miles of Alaska shoreline.
   The number of people ``directly employed on the battlefront _ on
the shoreline'' will go from 1,475 to 2,500, William D. Stevens,
president of Exxon Co. U.S.A., said in a statement issued in
Washington.
   On Tuesday, a top Coast Guard officer had said Exxon must beef
up its cleanup troops rather than its public relations staff if it
hoped to meet its Sept. 15 deadline for sopping up the nation's
worst-ever oil spill.
   ``What they'll have to do is come back next spring and finish
the cleanup,'' said Vice Adm. Clyde Robbins, the top federal
official directly supervising the cleanup.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner said Exxon's increase in
resources improves the likelihood the company will meet its cleanup
goal. Nevertheless, said Skinner, the cleanup might have to
continue in the spring.
   In a revised cleanup plan submitted to the Coast Guard, Exxon
said it will increase the number of people to be involved in the
summer cleanup from a previously planned 3,400 workers to 5,000. It
also said it will bring in seven additional barges and 17 more
landing craft, bringing the number of vessels to 70.
   In other spill-related developments Tuesday:
   _A 50-foot landing craft involved in the cleanup sank in Valdez
Arm. The three people aboard the vessel Hummer were rescued
uninjured, the Coast Guard said. The Coast Guard is investigating
the sinking of the boat, which was under contract to Exxon, said
Dave Haulbrook, a Coast Guard spokesman.
   _The high-tech Soviet skimmer Vaidogubsky was being sent home
after Exxon declined to renew its $15,000-a-day contract. The ship
had been skimming oil for a month, but its pumps and machinery
jammed frequently on the thick, weather-hardened crude.
   ``We shouldn't blame the Russians,'' Exxon operations manager
Bill Rainey said. ``It was just not the type of oil she was good
in.''
   _In Washington, a bill that would require oil companies to be
able to handle spills within five hours was introduced in the House.
   _Authorities extended by five days the deadline for having the
worst oil damage cleaned off four islands in Prince William Sound,
a favorite birthing area for seals. The new deadline is May 15.
   ``They don't really start pupping until May 20, but with all the
activity we thought we'd give them a chance to reinhabit the area
and settle down,'' said Bill Pilcher, a state Department of Fish
and Game spokesman.
   During a tour of the islands, Robbins said Exxon appeared to be
concerned as much with public relations as with cleaning up the
oil. The company must double the number of workers if it hopes to
meet the deadline, he said.
   ``They have sent P.R. people into the field instead of
operators,'' he said.
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker said he couldn't comment on Robbins'
statements.
   Company officials have promised to clean up the spill but say
they were hampered by government agencies after the Exxon Valdez
ran aground March 24, spilling more than 10 million gallons of
crude.
   State and federal officials have said Exon's complaints are
groundless and misleading.
   Earlier this week, the company said it had spent about $95
million on the cleanup. Robbins said the final price may reach five
times that.
   ``I'd be surprised if it didn't cost them $500 million,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Striking Miners, Management Confront Each Other at Annual Meeting</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEAN GOLEMBESKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking coal miners and Pittston Co.
management squared off today at the company's annual meeting,
debating three labor proposals questioning the company's operation.
   Representatives of both sides traded charges but no vote had
been taken on the proposals by noon and debate dragged on.
   As the annual meeting inside Pittston headquarters got underway,
the chants of hundreds of striking coalminers from Virginia and
West Virginia could be heard.
   United Mine Workers members at Pittston mines in Virginia, West
Virginia and Kentucky have been without a contract since Feb. 1,
1988. About 1,700 miners in Virginia and West Virginia struck April
5 over what they called labor practices.
   Since the strike began, about 1,300 coalminers and their spouses
have been arrested, including about 140 on felony charges from
rock-throwing and assault.
   The union has placed three proposals on the company's proxy
ballot that challenge the way the Greenwich-based company is
operated.
   One proposal asks that shareholders be allowed to vote on the
company's anti-takeover measures and another seeks to have
shareholders vote by secret ballot. The third measure would force
the establishment of a committee that would study whether Pittston
should sell any subsidiaries.
   The proposals are part of the union's so-called ``corporate
campaign.'' The company said it considers the strategy to be
harassment.
   Kenneth Zinn, union director of special projects, said the
company's anti-takeover measures adversely affect the company's
stock value and make it unattractive to potential suitors.
   The so-called ``poison pill'' is unfair because it was
implemented by management without a vote by shareholders, Zinn said.
   ``We think shareholders should vote on whether they want to hand
over this important right to the board,'' he said. ``We believe it
may have a negative affect on share price.''
   Paul Douglas, Pittston's chairman and chief executive officer,
disputed the union claim, saying the poison-pill measures ``are not
entrenchment devices'' intended to keep management in place.
   ``I think there are some honest differences of opinions about
it,'' he said.
   The Pittston Co. took out a full page advertisement in the local
newspaper today accusing the union of ``using violence to bully the
companies it targets into submission.''
   The advertisement accused the UMW and its leaders of selfishly
encouraging striking miners to commit serious crimes. The ad said
that striking miners have seriously hurt innocent people and that
striking miners have also been hurt in picket line violence.
   Both sides met with a federal mediator for the first time Monday
in New York. No details of the talks have been made public.
   Pittston earned $48.6 million in 1988, including $36.4 mllion
from coal operations. The company lost $116 million on coal
operations in 1987, primarily due to the devaluation of mining
properties.
   Besides coal mining, Pittston is the parent company of
Burlington Air Express Inc., Brink's Inc. and Brink's Home Security
Inc.

   How does a local supermarket chain that
closes on Sundays and doesn't sell beer beat a national chain and
make it to the top of the grocery store heap?
   The personal touch, says James E. Ukrop.
   That's why Ukrop, 52-year-old president of Ukrop's Super Markets
Inc., is carrying a letter in his briefcase from a woman upset that
her coffee brand is sold in smaller cans.
   The letter, in which the woman threatens to stop shopping at the
store, is covered with notes from Ukrop's conversation with the
district manager about why the store can't satisfy her. Ukrop says
he'll respond personally to the complaint.
   ``It was addressed to me,'' he said in an interview. ``I'll
answer it. I hope she comes back.''
   Getting a personal reply from the president of Ukrop's wouldn't
surprise most regular customers of the Richmond stores, where
clerks are friendly, baggers insist on carrying shoppers'
groceries, and a framed statement declares that the stores' mission
is ``to serve our customers and community more effectively than
anyone else by treating our customers, associates and suppliers as
we personally would like to be treated.''
   Despite not selling beer, wine or liquor, staying closed on
Sundays, and steering clear of promotions like double coupons, the
family-owned chain has beaten out national leaders such as Safeway
to take the biggest bite of the Richmond market.
   Ukrop's had sales of $273.5 million or about 30 percent of the
metropolitan region's grocery sales in 1987-88, according to the
industry publication Food World.
   The stores have a national reputation for excellence, said Bill
Bishop, a food retailing analyst with Willard Bishop Consulting in
Barrington, Ill.
   ``The people that know them know them as a company that runs
superb food stores,'' Bishop said. ``I think that far and away the
most important thing that Ukrop's does is to put their customer
number one. A lot of people say that, but it's not done all that
frequently, and they do that.''
   With 19 stores and two more on the way, Ukrop's is still growing
_ but not too much. Safeway has 18 stores in areas where both
chains compete.
   Ukrop's will continue growing with Richmond, Ukrop sad, and is
expanding in new directions, such as its own central bakery and
central kitchen for prepared take-home foods that are set to open
soon.
   But Ukrop doesn't want to expand the stores beyond the Richmond
area, where he can keep a close eye on them. The farthest store is
in Petersburg, about 30 miles away, and Ukrop said he frequently
rejects requests to open stores elsewhere.
   ``We have an advantage in being local,'' he said. ``We live
here, we have friends here. We talk to our neighbors, hear what
they like and don't like. We're able to put our arms around our
business. We can do a lot of things that companies with branches
can't do.''
   Things like bringing employees, known as associates, together at
``values meetings'' with Ukrop or his younger brother, vice
president Robert S. Ukrop, to talk about what customers expect.
Workers, even part-timers, are encouraged to memorize a list of the
store's ``corporate values'' and recite them publicly, which gets
them their name on the values honor roll and a Ukrop's lapel pin.
   People always ask where he finds such good employees, Ukrop
said, and the answer is the company takes the dollars it doesn't
spend on promotions such as double coupons and games and invests
them in its workers.
   Running the business is ``a contact sport'' between management
and employees, said Robert Ukrop, a past co-captain of the
University of Richmond basketball team. Eleven years younger than
his brother, he speaks in quick bursts of enthusiasm, sprinkling
the conversation with expressions like ``It's fun.''
   Their father, Joe Ukrop, founded the family's first grocery
store in 1937. The brothers grew up next to the store, and neither
of them has ever considered a different career.
   There's never been a conflict between family values and running
the company, they said.
   ``Growing up, we went to Sunday school, we knew what the golden
rule was,'' James Ukrop said. ``We never heard it related to
business, but we both saw it.
   ``We've never had to make a decision that wasn't consistent with
our values,'' he said. ``We're very fortunate _ if we felt we
couldn't operate our business that way, we can sell it. I
personally would opt out.''
   Not selling alcohol goes along with the brothers' Baptist
values, and they say they've never considered doing otherwise.
   ``It's a non-issue,'' Bobby Ukrop said. The store stays closed
on Sundays, he said, because ``if you want to be the best place to
shop, you have to be the best place to work.''
   ``We lose some business and gain some business,'' because of
those policies, James Ukrop said. ``Our friends around the country
don't think we're very bright.''
   Ukrop's also gives 10 percent of its pretax profits to charity,
and for the last two years has donated more than $1 million to
non-profit groups that get 2 percent of the sales receipts they
collect.
   Giving to charity is ``just the way we think it ought to be,''
Robert Ukrop said.
   ``You can't separate what's family and what's business.''

   Stock prices were mostly higher on slim volume,
with the market focused on the Treasury auction and on economic
reports due out later this week.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 8.07 points to
2,379.40 at 2 p.m. EDT. The blue-chip indicator was off 1.65 at
noon New York time.
   Advancing issues barely edged out decliners on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 675 issues up, 633 down and 574 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board totaled 104.30 million shares.
   Brokers said the market regained some of its early losses after
a slight recovery in the bond market.
   On Tuesday, stock and bond prices fell in response to the
Treasury's sale of three-year notes. Analysts said investors were
concerned that U.S. and foreign investors bought fewer of the notes
than expected.
   The market was expecting more of the same today, but initial
results from today's sale showed a more favorable response.
   ``The rumor is that the 10-year treasury note auction is doing
fairly well,'' said Philip Puccio, senior vice president with
Dillon, Read &amp; Co. ``The bond market hasn't sold off to any great
degree, so it seems the auction is taking hold.''
   The final day of the sale is Thursday, when the government will
auction 30-year bonds.
   Traders said the market also continued a cautious posture ahead
of retail sales and producer price reports due out Thursday and
Friday. The concern is that data suggesting strong economic growth
and higher inflation could drive up interest rates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

<HEAD>Enforcement Chief To Step Down</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission said
today that enforcement director Gary Lynch, who led the agency's
crackdown on insider trading on Wall Street, would leave the
commission staff in mid-July.
   Lynch, as the agency's top enforcement officer since 1985, was
the prime mover behind the commission's biggest cases in recent
years, including the settlements with stock speculator Ivan Boesky
and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Lynch had joined the commission as a staff attorney in 1976, a
year after graduating from Duke University Law School. Lynch, in an
interview, said he had no specific plans after leaving the SEC.
   ``I've been director for over four years. It just got to the
point where it seemed like it was the appropriate time to move on
to something new,'' he said.
   SEC Chairman David S. Ruder, in a statement, said, ``During
Gary's tenure ... the commission has undertaken major programs to
combat securities fraud. ... The culmination of Gary's very
successful career ... is, of course, the historic settlement ...
between Drexel Burnham Lambert and the commission.''
   That settlement of civil charges, announced last month, capped a
two-year investigation that began when Boesky implicated the
nation's fifth-largest securities firm. He settled insider trading
charges with the SEC in 1986.
   The Drexel civil settlement helped pave the way for Drexel to
settle a criminal complaint and pay a record $650 million in fines
and restitution.
   The insider trading scandal uncovered during Lynch's tenure
forced venerable brokerage houses to re-evaluate their compliance
and ethics codes and led Congress to increase the penalties for
insider trading.
   ``I think we went an awful long way to cleaning up some serious
problems that existed,'' Lynch said. `` ... There's more concern
now about the possibility of being the subject of an SEC
enforcement action. In addition, probably more importantly, as a
result of the abuses that were exposed, brokerage firms have become
more alert to possible problems within their own organizations that
can lead to near disaster and ruin.''
   Lynch is credited with personally piercing the veil of secrecy
surrounding the Bahamas branch of a Swiss bank, where convicted
inside trader Dennis Levine maintained an account. It was Levine
whose cooperation with the SEC led to Boesky, who in turn
implicated Drexel in the largest securities fraud case ever brought
by the government.
   Lynch took over the SEC's top cop job at a time of turmoil for
the agency and is credited with restoring morale. His predecessor,
John Fedders, departed amid charges he had beaten his wife. Now 38
years old, Lynch was the youngest enforcement director in the
agency's history.
   As a government employee, Lynch earned an annual salary of about
$72,000, far less than he could earn in private practice. However,
he said neither the salary nor the long hours he worked played a
major role in his decision to leave.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Dip On Reported Argentine Sales To Soviets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid rumors that the Soviet
Union had purchased as much as 500,000 metric tons of soybean meal
from Argentina.
   Wheat futures advanced slightly while corn prices were mixed.
   The Soviet Union had been widely expected to make a major
purchase of U.S. soybean meal. The talk that they had bought from
Argentina instead prompted selling of futures contracts.
   There was no official confirmation of the rumors, which
apparently originated with oilseed traders in Buenos Aires.
   But a Soviet purchase of Argentine soybean meal ``shouldn't be a
major surprise,'' said New York-based grain specialist Ted Mao of
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., since both Argentina and Brazil are
flush with newly harvested soybeans.
   The wheat market see-sawed in a narrow range as traders
positioned themselves for Thursday's Agriculture Department
winter-wheat crop estimate.
   At the close, wheat was { cent to 1{ cents higher with the
contract for delivery in May at $4.26{ a bushel; corn was 1 cent

   About 10 years ago, suburban White Lake was
considered too thinly settled for a new K mart.
   Now, the prospect of future growth has prompted the nation's
second-largest retailer to open a store in the area, surrounded by
meadows that developers plan to cover with homes.
   ``This store will definitely be a store of the future with the
growth that's coming in here,'' said manager Gary Cook. ``We've got
a big development coming in behind here with townhouses and
apartments.''
   The promise of developing neighborhoods like White Lake _ plus
competitive pressure on from No. 1 Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. and No. 3
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. _ keeps K mart Corp. scrambling to scout new
sites and re-scout old ones as it attempts to place stores in every
untapped market.
   There aren't many surprises in the search; K mart says it
already is in nearly every county of the United States.
   But the store chain keeps a squad of real estate experts, store
designers and demographers busy looking for ways to squeeze ahead,
including placing stores in suburban fringes where homes are still
going up.
   K mart has more than 2,200 stores in 48 states and Puerto Rico.
It plans to open 70 more this year.
   A standard K mart takes up 86,000 square feet, while a
free-standing store generally requires eight acres, to provide for
the building and parking lot.
   In contrast, Chicago-based Sears' large stores, with displays of
space-filling furniture and appliance lines, typically take up
150,000 square feet, with some using more than 200,000 square feet.
   K mart's construction and real estate manager Mike Skiles has
property experts scouting several hundred potential locations at
any given time from K mart's five regional offices as well as its
Troy headquarters, he said.
   Leads come from their efforts and from shopping center
developers who want a K mart store to anchor a new mall. Final
decisions follow demographic studies and site visits, Skiles said.
   ``Other retailers, the state of the economy in that particular
area, the amount of housing growth that's occurring and the quality
of the particular piece of real estate would all be factors,''
Skiles said.
   Although K mart's major target is the 25- to 45-year-old
middle-income consumer, the demographic profile of the K mart
shopper is much broader.
   For example:
   _Forty-two percent are high school graduates, 23 percent didn't
finish high school, 19 percent have some college, 16 percent are
college graduates.
   _Forty-five percent are aged 25-44, 26 percent are 45-64, 16
percent are 18-24, 13 percent are older than 65.
   _Forty-three percent live in households of three or four, 30
percent in two-member households, 18 percent live in households of
five or more, 9 percent live alone.
   _Thirty-nine percent have household incomes of $25,000-$49,999,
25 percent have less than $15,000, 22 percent have $15,000-$24,999,
13 percent earn more than $50,000.
   ``We're everywhere, so the demographics of our shopper are more
or less like the demographics of the country as a whole,'' said Ron
Gellish, manager of an operations and research department that
employs two full-time demographers.
   Some new K marts represent ``back filling'' in areas where sites
couldn't be found before, Skiles said, such as a store that opened
last year in Detroit's long-established Oak Park neighborhood.
   K mart had looked at the area over the years but never was able
to find a suitable building, or a new site with enough space to
meet its needs, Skiles said.
   However, a mall developer now wants a K mart to anchor his Oak
Park project and the plan fits K mart's needs as well.
   Most new K marts are in growing areas like White Lake, where the
expanding Pontiac, White Lake, Union Lake and Highland communities
are beginning to converge about 35 miles northwest of Detroit.
   The new White Lake store stands amid grassy fields, although
builders' signboards tout development on the way.
   ``We're opening to service the new housing out there,'' Skiles
said.
   The 86,000-square-foot store also is in sight of the slopes and
lifts of Alpine Ski Valley. In a departure from traditional
discount decor, beams in the facade around the store entrance
suggest a chalet motif.
   That kind of planning is K mart's best hope for a competitive
edge, rather than any dramatic attempt to surprise Sears or
Wal-Mart, Gellish said.
   ``We know where their stores are. They know where ours are. Our
moves are pretty well publicized in the trade journals,'' he said.
``There's no secrets. We just have to operate as efficiently as
possible.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From Batman Converses to fuchsia-colored Keds,
keeping in step with fashions this season is more comfortable as
far as feet are concerned.
   Spurred by the habits of health-obsessed yuppies who go for that
athletically inspired look, variants on the basic sneaker have
become so with-it that sports shoe manufacturers are rushing to
capitalize on the trend.
   Sneakers, frequently less expensive than alternatives, make
sense from a practical standpoint even if the wearer isn't fixated
on fitness, shoe stylists say.
   ``People are going to wear what's comfortable,'' said Kenneth
Cole, owner of a shoe company bearing his name. ``Women are
becoming much more practical than they were in the past.''
   Even feet of the well-heeled are shod in canvas. Several widely
watched designers have designated sneakers as the shoes to wear
with their warm weather creations.
   Influential designer Donna Karan showed virtually her entire
spring and summer DKNY line, including dresses, with sneakers,
which retail for about $45 a pair.
   Other designers are peddling sneakers with their names on them,
including Calvin Klein and Liz Claiborne.
   Several arbiters of what's in and what's out have bestowed their
approval on a more casual approach to attiring feet.
   But Ana Luisa Behrens, who tracks shoe fashions for Vogue
Magazine, doesn't have a completely anything-goes attitude.
   ``I prefer to see sneakers during the day. To me it's out of the
question at night _ unless you are going to a rock concert,'' she
says.``I think that the sneaker has the right moment ... It's not
something that could be treated like a leather shoe or a suede
shoe.''
   Among the main beneficiaries of widersneaker wearing are
manufacturers of athletic shoes.
   Converse Inc. has spiced up its All Star collection by
introducing paprika, spinach, crocus and other hues. Wearers
wanting to get back to the basics in hi-tops can still select from
the classic color lineup of white, black, red and navy.
   ``We feel we've got to visually merchandise our lines more
aggressively,'' says Stephen Encarnacao, a senior vice president of
North Reading, Mass.-based Converse. ``What we've got to do is to
make our All Star not just the classic we all grew up with but to
make it more exciting visually.''
   Dealers are giving Converse's refurbishments an enthusiastic
reception.
   ``They've said, `Gee! Your timing is perfect','' Encarnacao says.
   The company's timing coincides with its sneakers and similar
ones being sported by popular television and film characters.
   In the TV show ``The Wonder Years,'' for instance, the main
character and his grade-school buddies frequently are seen in
hi-tops. Melanie Griffith cavorted in rubber-soled canvas as the
star of the movie ``Working Girl.''
   Converse, a subsidiary of St. Louis-based Interco Inc., hopes to
wow sneaker wearers with its Batman line of hi-tops for adults.
   Full-scale distribution of the novelty shoes, one model dotted
with the Batman yellow and black logo and another featuring
Batman's arch enemy, the Joker, is timed to coincide with the late
June release of the movie ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton as
the masked hero and Jack Nicholson as the Joker.
   Once known as the maker of little white canvas sneakers and
child-sized rubber-toe-capped red models, Keds Corp. has been
adding to its repertoire for several years and trying to enliven
its image.
   This year, it is pitching offerings on primetime network
television, marking the first such advertising campaign for Keds
this decade. The commercials are designed for a broad audience,
specifically intended to tweak teenagers' interest while still
appealing to women 25- to 45-years old.
   Barbara Scott, director of marketing for Keds, based in
Cambridge, Mass. and a division of Stride Rite Corp., says a key
change has been an expansion of colors available at any one time.
This season bright ones _ fuchsia, peacock-like blue, vivid green _
seem to be the rage. Pastel tints still have a following among
Keds' fanciers, Scott says.
   Keds also is introducing a walking shoe in the autumn and has
expanded into leather lines.
   The changes are paying off for Keds. Gross sales are expected to
reach $200 million in 1989, a four-fold increase from 1985's $50
million.
   The undisputed champ in the athletic-leisure segment of the shoe
market is Reebok International Ltd.
   In the way Sanka has become a synomym for decaffeinated coffee,
the name Reebok is becoming a generic term for a shoe favored by
weekend warriors _ people who want to look like they work out all
the time but probably only do so on weekends, not serious athletes.
   That's not to say the company hasn't carved a slice of the
high-performance shoe market, an area which Beaverton, Ore.-based
Nike Inc. currently dominates. Reebok's strong sales, plus the
company's determination to get inventories down to more manageable
levels after an excessive expansion last year, has significantly
shrunken supplies of Reeboks this spring.
   ``I don't think there's any dramatic shortage out there,'' said
Paul R. Duncan, chief financial officer of the company
headquartered in Canton, Mass. ``It's not a big deal as long as it
gets resolved in a few months. There's no shortage and there's
certainly no real excess either.''

   Stock prices finished higher today in lackluster
trading as investors awaited Friday's report on wholesale prices.
   The market opened nearly flat and traded in a narrow range
throughout most of the session.
   Early in the day, investors focused on the bond market and the
second day of the Treasury's $28.75 billion quarterly refunding.
   ``It was a very lethargic market with people watching the
refunding,'' said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading for Nikko
Securities International.
   On Tuesday, stock and bond prices fell in response to the
Treasury's sale of three-year notes. Analysts said investors were
concerned that U.S. and foreign investors bought fewer of the notes
than expected and feared more of the same in the second round.
   But bond prices recovered slightly and stocks followed after the
$9.50 billion sale of 10-year notes on what observers said was
speculation that at least one foreign investor had made a major
purchase.
   However, volume remained light with institutional investors
staying on the sidelines, reluctant to make commitments.
   The final day of the sale is Thursday, when the government will
auction 30-year bonds.
   Traders said the market also remained cautious ahead of the
retail sales and producer price reports due out Thursday and Friday
respectively. Investors hope the reports will provide a better clue
about whether the economy is continuing its robust growth.
   Signs of continued strength could mean inflation is still a
problem and that the Federal Reserve will continue tightening
credit by raising interest rates. Higher rates have slowed housing
and other sectors and raised fears of a recession.

   House tax writers today rebuffed President
Bush's savings and loan bailout plan and approved an alternative
that will add $50 billion to the federal deficit over the next
three years.
   On a 25-11 vote with two of 11 Republicans siding with all its
Democrats, the House Ways and Means Committee rejected Bush's
elaborate financing scheme to prevent the most expensive government
bailout in history from swelling the deficit.
   Republicans predicted that the vote will upset a delicate ``no
new taxes'' deficit reducing budget agreement with the White House
that was approved just last week by the House and Senate.
   ``We've fairly well destroyed the budget agreement between the
administration and Congress,'' complained Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.
   Democrats, however, called it an attempt at ``honest budgeting
for a change,'' citing the fact that past deficit reduction targets
have never been met in reality.
   The vote was the first major setback for Bush's bailout plan,
which moved through the Senate and the House Banking Committee with
only minor changes in response to repeated administration vows of a
veto if it was altered greatly.
   Reps. Willis D. Gradison of Ohio and Raymnond J. McGrath of New
York were the two Republicans who sided with the panel's 23
Democrats in voting for an amendment by Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,
to add the S&amp;L bailout to the deficit.
   ``I have great ethical and moral problems with the way this
program is financed'' under Bush's plan, Gibbons said. ``This is a
mess that ought to be cleaned up without ... passing the costs on
to our children and grandchildren.''
   As a way to prevent the S&amp;L crisis from showing up in the
federal deficit, the administration proposed raising the immediate
$50 billion infusion of cash to cover S&amp;L failures with a sale of
30-year bonds to be issued by a new quasi-government agency, the
Resolution Financing Corp.
   Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office, maintain
that this approach will cost taxpayers a total of $4.5 billion more
in interest payments over the next 30 years than if the money was
borrowed directly through the U.S. Treasury.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady spent more than an hour today
meeting behind closed doors with members of the Ways and Means
Committee, repeating a threat he made earlier to recommend that
Bush veto any plan that would add to the deficit.'
   Brady left the meeting smiling. But when asked by reporters if
Bush's plan had sufficient support in the committee, he said only,
``You never know about that. We'll have to wait and see.''
   Gibbons led the attack on the administration's plan after the
committee's chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesday
that he would not mount an offensive against it.
   ``I am not working the committee to achieve any result,''
Rostenkowski said. ``Reasonable people can differ on the issue. All
members ... should vote the way they want.''
   Richard Breeden, a White House assistant and the prime architect
of Bush's S&amp;L plan, on Tuesday repeated earlier threats by
administration officials to recommend that Bush veto any bill that
would increase the federal deficit.
   Similar threats earlier stopped an alternative proposed by
Senate Democrats and members of the House Banking Committee cold in
its tracks. Both the House Banking panel and the full Senate
already have approved Bush's plan.
   In a ``walkthrough'' Tuesday of possible ways they could change
the package, several Ways and Means Democrats and one Republican,
Rep. Willis Gradison of Ohio, said they still would like to replace
Bush's financing plan with one advocated by the Congressional
Budget Office.
   By including the bailout's cost as part of the budget and
borrowing the funds directly through the Treasury, CBO experts
contend, the government could save interest costs totaling $1.5
billion over the next 10 years.
   However, Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins told the
lawmakers the required waiver would drive a ``battering ram''
through the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law unless taxes are
increased or offsetting cuts are made elsewhere in the budget.
   ``We don't want it used as an excuse to create a hole in
Gramm-Rudman so that any mega-financing needs can get a waiver,''
Mullins said, citing as an example the hundreds of millions of
dollars that a nuclear weapons plant cleanup is now anticipated to
cost.
   But Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., complained that Bush's plan will
make a ``big winner'' out of Wall Street investment houses through
commissions in handling off-budget bonds that will be used to
finance the government's share of the bailout.
   The Ways and Means panel also may challenge a provision inserted
in the bill by the House Banking Committee to require S&amp;Ls to
devote $75 million to $150 million of their annual profits to
subsidize low-income home mortgages.
   ``We believe that looks like a tax,'' said Ronald Pearlman, head
of the Joint Committee on Taxation's staff.
   The committee also is looking at whether to continue widely
criticized tax breaks for companies that take failed S&amp;Ls off the
government's hands.
   Investors and corporations such as Ford Motor Co. received a
total of more than $8 billion in tax breaks last year under
long-term agreements to take some 170 failed S&amp;Ls off the
government's hands.
   Those provisions _ such as tax-free treatment of government
subsidies in the mergers and allowing buyers to use the losses of
the thrifts they bought to offset income from other operations _
are due to expire at the end of this year. In its bill, the Senate
urged that they be wiped out immediately.

   The energy futures market was mixed in moderate
trading Wednesday, with home heating oil rising in price but crude
oil and gasoline declining.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
24 cents lower at $19.52 a barrel. The contract had risen 32 cents
Tuesday.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,
wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery declined 0.80 cent to
64.72 cents a gallon, after rising 0.54 cent Tuesday.
   June heating oil, which rose 0.30 cent Tuesday, settled at 47.48
cents a gallon, up another 0.49 cent.
   Peter Beutel, an energy analyst at Elders Futures Inc.,
attributed Wednesday's trading largely to internal forces of supply
and demand.
   However, he said the market was somewhat affected by the latest
weekly American Petroleum Institute report, which showed an
increase in U.S. crude and gasoline supplies and a drop in supplies
of heating oil.
   Traders also remain concerned that members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries may be raising daily production
above the current quota of 18.5 million barrels, Beutel said.
   The oil cartel is scheduled to meet next month in Vienna,
Austria to review its production and pricing policies.

   OPEC Secretary General Subroto said Wednesday that
world demand for petroleum was strong and could support a higher
benchmark price by the cartel.
   Subroto met Wednesday with Texas oil officials, who he indicated
had expressed support for the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries' attempts to stabilize world oil prices.
   The 13-nation cartel agreed last November to limit its
production to levels that would support a benchmark price of $18 a
barrel, about 18.5 million barrels a day. The action has helped
crude prices recover from their October 1988 lows of near $12 a
barrel.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled
24 cents lower Wednesday at $19.52 a barrel.
   OPEC was to review its production at a meeting scheduled to
begin June 5 in Vienna, Austria. There has been speculation that
the cartel would increase its self-imposed production limits if
demand was strong enough to support higher output without
depressing prices.
   Subroto said OPEC nations have been striving for stability at
$18 per barrel, but he realized petroleum demand worldwide was
strong and could support a higher price.
   ``We are all along for cooperation between the major players in
the oil industry, including producers and also consumers, because
we think only by working together and not antagonizing...we can
bring the stability in the markets that we believe we can,'' said
Subroto.
   Subroto had a 1{-hour breakfast meeting with Texas Railroad
Commissioner Kent Hance, about 10 independent oil producers and
others at a downtown hotel. Subroto agreed with Hance that the
meeting had gone well.
   ``He has been instrumental in involving me in the thinking of
the oil industry in the United States, particularly in Texas and so
on,'' Subroto said. ``And we are very grateful for him to give an
indication of the support of the efforts that OPEC has given to
achieve stability in the market.
   Hance said state energy consumers and officials appreciated the
opportunity to meet with Subroto.
   ``One of the important things is that we have to have a dialogue
with OPEC because they are the major player. They are so important
not only to producers but to consumers in the United States,'' said
Hance.
   Subroto was scheduled to address a Thursday luncheon sponsored
by Southern Methodist University's Institute for the Study of Earth
and Man in his only planned U.S. talk this year.

   The dollar continued a minor retreat Wednesday,
digesting the gains that took it to nine-month highs at the start
of the week. Gold prices were mixed.
   Foreign-exchange dealers said the dollar's decline came without
any push from central banks and appeared to be a reaction to the
rapid run-up that peaked on Monday.
   ``Fresh buying of dollars never really materialized,'' said Marc
Cohen, a vice president at Republic National Bank of New York.
   In London late Wednesday, one British pound cost $1.6717, more
expensive for buyers than $1.6605 on Tuesday. The pound also rose
against the dollar in New York, to $1.6740 from $1.6665 on Tuesday.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 134.44 Japanese yen, down from
135.00 yen. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded fractionally
higher at 134.45 yen. In New York the dollar fell to 134.41 yen
from 134.53 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York compared with Tuesday's late
rates included: 1.9020 West German marks, down from 1.9094; 1.6921
Swiss francs, down from 1.6955; 1.1843 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1870; 6.4220 French francs, down from 6.4455; and 1,385.25
Italian lire, down from 1,391.50.
   Other late rates for the dollar in Europe compared with
Tuesday's late rates: 1.9047 West German marks, down from 1.9158;
1.6925 Swiss francs, down from 1.7035; 6.4645 French francs,
unchanged; 2.1500 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1610; 1,390.125
Italian lire, down from 1,397.125; 1.1849 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1869.
   Republic National Bank of New York said gold bullion was bid at
$376.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $378 an ounce late
Tuesday. Earlier gold bullion for current delivery fell to $377.70
an ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York, down from $378.80.
   Gold traded late in London, the major market, at a bid price of
$377.25 a troy ounce, up from $376.50. The late bid price in
Zurich, Switzerland, was $376.75, up from $376.40.
   Earlier in Hong Kong gold closed at $378.25, up from $376.15.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at $5.68 a troy ounce, up
from $5.63. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current
delivery fell to $5.607 a troy ounce, down from $5.667.

   Stock prices rose in lackluster trading
Wednesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average rebounding from an
eight-day losing streak.
   Traders said the market drifted in a fairly narrow range for
most of the session with little except the Treasury's $28.75
billion refunding to give the market direction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.12 points to
finish at 2,374.45, ending an eight-day string of losses, the
longest since August 1982. The blue-chip indicator had lost 47.66
points since April 28.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by about 9 to 8 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
722 issues up, 641 down and 594 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 146 million shares,
down from 150.09 million in the previous session.
   Market strategists said large investors remained reluctant to
make commitments before the government provides new information on
inflation and before the final outcome of the Treasury auction.
   Traders are worried that the reports this week will show strong
economic growth and higher inflation that will drive up interest
rates.
   Figures on retail sales are due Thursday followed by producer
prices Friday.
   ``People want to keep the economy from overheating. But we keep
getting mixed signals,'' said Thomas Walsh, head of equity trading
for Nikko Securities Intl. ``Until the interest rate picture gets
clearer and we get a stable dollar the market will be fickle and
boring.''
   A slight recovery in bond prices after the second round of the
Treasury's quarterly borrowing failed to bring new players into the
market.
   On the first day of the sale Tuesday, stock and bond prices fell
in response to what strategists called a disappointing response to
the Treasury's sale of new debt. There was fear the Treasury would
have to raise the interest offered on its fresh issues of notes to
attract more buyers.
   A more favorable response by foreign investors after Wednesday's
sale of 10-year notes produced only a brief upward blip in the bond
market.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 174.47 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $5.81 billion, or 0.19
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.33 to 171.13.
   Among actively traded issues, Avon surged 3~ to 39~ after Amway
offered $39 a share for the company. Newmont Mining gained 1 to 40\
on expectations that a buyer would emerge for the company.
   On the downside, Pan Am remained unchanged at 5 and Northwest
Airlines fell 1 to 103\ after Tuesday's announcement that Pan Am is
considering buying Northwest. AT&amp;T lost \ to 33| and IBM dropped [
to 109|.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.80 to 352.15, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.61 to 305.80.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
0.67 to 429.64. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 344.80, down 0.29.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Futures Extend Sharp Gain In Speculative Rally</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices of frozen pork belly futures soared the permitted daily
limit of 2 cents a pound for the second straight day Wednesday as
more speculators hopped aboard the market's rally from its lowest
level in nine years.
   Other livestock and meat futures finished the day mixed on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   On other markets, energy futures were widely mixed; precious
metals were lower; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Frozen pork bellies settled 1.53 cents to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in May at 35.80.
   The pork-belly market has gained more than 17 percent since last
Thursday, when the May contract fell to 30.47 cents a pound, the
lowest price for a near-month contract since mid-1980.
   Prices for hogs and pork bellies, which are sliced to make
bacon, typically rise in May as hog marketings decline due to a
variety of seasonal factors.
   But this year's upturn in pork-belly prices is more pronounced
than usual because the market has been severely depressed for
nearly a year.
   Frozen pork bellies averaged about 65 cents a pound from
mid-1981 to mid-1988. But prices began falling sharply in the
spring of 1988 when it became apparent that production was far
outpacing bacon consumption.
   The Agriculture Department reported last month that as of April
1, U.S. cold storage warehouses contained 133.8 million pounds of
frozen pork bellies, the second-largest April 1 tally on record.
   Chuck Levitt, senior livestock market analyst with Shearson
Lehman Hutton Inc. in Chicago, said the aggressive stockpiling
continued through April and he estimated that 150 million pounds of
frozen bellies were on hand as of May 1.
   ``We haven't had that many bellies in storage in any month for
at least 25 years,'' Levitt said. ``We are not going to run out of
pork bellies.''
   So despite expectations for a seasonal drop in hog slaughters,
the supply-and-demand factors for pork bellies are predominantly
bearish.
   Analysts attributed this week's strong rally to technical
factors, which basically means chart interpreters decided it was
time for prices to rise.
   ``Technically, the market got grossly oversold,'' Levitt said.
``Technically, it hasn't had a significant rally in God knows how
many months.''
   In other livestock and meat trading, live cattle settled .35
cent lower to .07 cent higher with June at 72.07 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .43 cent lower to .20 cent higher with May at
77.15 cents a pound; and live hogs were .20 cent lower to .22 cent
higher with June at 48.30 cents a pound.
   Near-month crude oil and unleaded gasoline futures tumbled while
heating oil futures rose on the New York Mercantile Exchange
following Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute report
showing unexpected increases in U.S. supplies of crude and gasoline
and a drop in supplies of petroleum distillates.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents lower to 17
cents higher with June at $19.53 a barrel; heating oil was .28 cent
to .63 cent higher with June at 47.50 cents a pound; unleaded
gasoline was .97 cent lower to .01 cent higher with June at 64.55
cents a gallon.
   Gold and silver futures retreated on New York's Commodity
Exchange, giving up nearly all of Tuesday's gains.
   Gold settled $1.10 to $1.70 lower with June at $379 a troy
ounce; silver was 6 cents lower across the board with July at
$5.695 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures fell moderately on the Chicago Board of Trade
amid rumors that the Soviet Union had purchased up to 500,000
metric tons of soybean meal from Argentina. Wheat futures advanced
slightly while corn prices were mixed.
   Wheat settled { cent to 1{ cents higher with May at $4.26{ a
bushel; corn was } cent lower to 2 cents higher with May at $2.79{
a bushel; oats were 2{ cents lower to 1{ cents higher with May at
$1.86 a bushel; soybeans were 2 cents to 8 cents lower with May at
$7.58\ a bushel.

<TEXT>
   An effort to make the Mustang Ranch the
nation's first publicly-owned bordello went on hold when a public
stock offering failed to sell the required number of shares by a
Wednesday deadline.
   Eric Walloga, whose American Wallstreet Securities Inc. is
underwriting the offering, said the firm had negotiated an
extension of the stock sale until Oct. 31 to allow time to
restructure the offer.
   Meanwhile, the sale of common stock in Mustang Ranch, Inc. has
been halted and all the money received for the shares so far will
be returned to investors, Walloga said in a statement released by
his office in Tampa, Fla.
   Walloga, president of American Wallstreet, was out of the office
Wednesday and unavailable for comment.
   Plans had called for a $23.3 million offering of stock in the
legal bordello at $20 a share. Walloga said last week about 75
percent of the 1.165 million shares had been sold during the
three-month offering, leaving the company some $5 million short of
its goal.
   A statement said an amendment would be filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the states that have approved sale of
the stock to reflect the terms of the new deal, which it said would
change the types of securities Mustang Ranch Inc. would offer.
   The statement said details of the restructured offering would
not be released pending an SEC response to a request for a ruling
on a technical issue over the amended offering.
   Peter Perry, a Reno attorney and vice president of Mustang Ranch
Inc., said in the statement that he expected the amended
registration to be filed with the SEC by June 15. Perry would not
comment specifically on the offer. them.
   Mustang Ranch Inc. is an investors' group composed primarily of
Reno businessmen and attorneys who are making a second attempt to
turn the brothel public.
   A 1985 bid by a group by John Davis of Irvine, Calif. fell
through after failing to generate enough interest in the $18
million proposal.
   The money raised in the current sale was to have provided $13
million to buy the 102-room brothel 10 miles east of Reno and its
440 acres of land from Joe and Sally Conforte, $5 million in
exchange for the Confortes' promise not to set up a competing
brothel and $5.3 million for expansion, improvements and working
capital.
   Conforte has been trying to sell the brothel since 1985 when he
was released from prison after serving 18 months on a tax
conviction.

<HEAD>Soon-To-Expire Steel Import Quotas Have Raised Prices, ITC Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Steel import quotas have hurt American exports
by raising steel prices, the U.S. International Trade Commission
said Wednesday as the Bush administration weighed the fate of the
soon-to-expire protectionist program.
   The ITC's 96-page report is certain to enliven the debate over
whether to continue steel import quota agreements with 19 nations
and the European Community.
   The Reagan administration negotiated five-year,
product-by-product voluntary restraint agreements, or ``VRAs,'' in
1984 with Japan, South Korea, Brazil, South Africa and other
nations to limit the flow of foreign steel into the United States.
   President Bush has pledged to continue the restraints in some
form beyond their Sept. 30 expiration But with the steel industry
newly profitable, opponents of the curbs believe they can make a
case for ending the program, or at least narrowing its scope.
   The ITC said the curbs caused steel prices in the United States
to rise by as much as 0.6 percent in 1985, 1.6 percent in 1986, 1.4
percent in 1987 and 0.2 percent in 1988. It said the weakening of
the dollar overseas and other factors also contributed
significantly to further price hikes.
   As a result of the VRA-induced price increases, the commission
estimated that American exports in steel-consuming industries
decreased by $258 million in 1985, $673 million in 1986, $699
million in 1987 and $95 million in 1988.
   ``The recent increases in steel prices have been distributed
unevenly among categories of customers,'' said the study, which was
conducted at the request of the House Ways and Means subcommittee
on trade.
   ``Price increases were not as great for large steel purchasers
as for small ones, apparently because the larger purchasers buy a
great deal of their steel through long-term contracts with prices
set for the duration of the contract, and smaller purchasers
generally buy steel in spot transactions,'' the ITC said.
   The question of whether the restraints have caused steel price
increases has divided American manufacturers into rival camps.
   Last month, a coalition of 374 manufacturers headed by Chrysler
Corp., Maytag Corp. and others was formed to lobby on behalf of
continuing the quota agreements on grounds that the curbs have
helped make the steel industry healthier.
   The coalition contends that steel price increases have been
caused by strong worldwide demand and shifting exchange rates.
   But a rival group, led in part by Caterpillar Inc., asserts that
had quotas not been in effect, steel prices would have risen only
modestly.
   The ITC cautioned that the figures reflected an ``upward bias''
because of the procedures it used. That means that the effect of
the import restraints on prices might have been overstated.

<HEAD>SEC Charges 2 Lawyers with Insider Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   A partner in a Buffalo, N.Y., law firm and his
brother-in-law agreed to settle civil Securities and Exchange
Commission charges Wednesday that he traded on inside information
about a client corporation.
   Without admitting or denying guilt, Henry M. Porter, agreed to
return more than $78,000 in alleged illegal trading profits and pay
an equal amount in civil penalties.
   Porter's brother-in-law, William Wolski, 40, of Marietta, Ga.,
also settled civil insider trading charges with the SEC and agreed
to return more than $37,000 in alleged illegal profits plus an
equal amount in penalties.
   The settlement remains subject to a judge's approval.
   According to court papers, Porter, 51, of Buffalo, has been a
partner since 1975 in the law firm of Lippes, Kaminsky,
Silverstein, Porter, Matthias &amp; Wexler, which was general counsel
to Amherst, N.Y.-headquartered Mark IV Industries Inc.
   The SEC charged in its civil complaint that Porter, traded in
the common stock of LFE Corp. and tipped Wolski in 1985, after
allegedly stealing confidential information from his law firm that
the Clinton, Mass.-based corporation was a possible takeover target
by Mark IV.
   The complaint also charged that in 1986 Porter tipped Wolski
about Mark IV's then-impending tender offer for Gulton Industries
Inc. and that Wolski, who was living in Stamford, Conn., at the
time, traded on Gulton securities.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said
Wednesday that a decision may be made soon on future use of a
controversial program that subsidizes farm exports.
   ``Low U.S. wheat stocks, uncertainty over the 1989 crop, and
more competitive U.S. prices in the world wheat market suggest a
period of more cautious use of the Export Enhancement Program,''
Yeutter told the House Agriculture Committee.
   He said after the hearing that a review of the program by his
department and the president's Office of Management and Budget is
``on a fast track.''
   He said the department has already done much of its work in the
review and OMB also is working promptly.
   Congressmen have criticized the Bush administration for slowing
down use of the program which discounts U.S. farm products for
foreign buyers. Other countries heavily subsidize their exports and
the United States has used the EEP as a way to compete with them.
   Yeutter said the administration is concerned about the wisdom of
using EEP on wheat exports in the wake of last year's devastating
drought, which drastically cut domestic supplies.
   Last week, President Bush approved sale to the Soviets of 1.5
million metric tons of wheat under the enhancement program. It was
the first use of EEP since late February, but some members of
Congress said the Soviets actually wanted more wheat and should
have been sold it.
   The administration also is considering selling 500,000 tons of
soybean oil to the Soviets at subsidized prices, The Washington
Post reported in Thursday's editions.
   The subsidy would cost taxpayers about $75 million at today's
prices, the Post said.
   The EEP is a bonus program through which U.S. exporters are
given extra commodities to enhance the amount they sell, thereby
bringing down the price to the buyer. The bonus comes from stored
commodities that were bought up by the government through other
farm price support programs.
   Rep. Harold Volkmer, D-Mo., asked Yeutter if failure to
aggressively use the EEP with wheat, in light of foreign
competition, wasn't similar to a grain embargo.
   Yeutter said the concern was only about winter wheat. ``EEP will
be available for the new crop of wheat,'' he said.
   Yeutter also said there had been ``sensationalized journalism''
regarding some food safety issues.
   Rep. Jim Jontz, D-Ind., asked whether all corn should be tested
for aflatoxin, a carcinogen that shows up after a drought and has
been widely reported by news organizations.
   Yeutter said there have been misconceptions about the extent of
the aflatoxin problem and its danger. Testing of all corn would be
costly, he said.
   ``We shouldn't change public policy because of sensationalized
journalism,'' he said.
   Jontz said the government should be responsive to consumers.
   ``We ought to be responsive, providing the consumer concerns are
rational,'' said Yeutter.
   The agriculture secretary voiced a similar opinion in a
discussion with Rep. Sid Morrison, R-Wash., about the use of the
growth and color-enhancing chemical Alar on apple crops.
   ``The health risk is miniscule,'' Yeutter said of way Alar has
been used on apple crops.
