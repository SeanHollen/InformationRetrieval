<TEXT>
   At Budapest's Deli station, a cluster of
old people, many in well-cut clothes grown shabby with wear,
welcomes the train from Vienna each morning.
   They clutch signs written in German offering rooms for rent.
   As pensioners surviving on as little as $60 a month, they need
cash from tourists who will pay, perhaps even in coveted hard
currency, for a bed.
   A Warsaw housewife, Maria, knows a retired professor who lives on
a monthly pension of less than $25.
   ``She has to sell everything she has in order to live,'' says
Maria, who asked that her last name not be used. ``Clothes,
ceramics, everything.''
   The pensioners are some of the millions of people failed by 40
years of Stalinism in Eastern Europe.
   After World War II, many on a continent ruined by fascism looked
to socialism for peace and prosperity. Soviet communism seemed full
of promise _ jobs, free education and health care, and equality in
societies where a small caste of rich had long dominated the
numerous poor.
   Communism forced heavy industry on traditionally agrarian areas,
while the ``bourgeois capitalists'' who could have managed the new
factories were stripped of their property and jailed or deported in
the purges of the 1950s.
   Shoddy buildings sprouted in the name of progress or in place of
historic cities bombed in World War II. A drab sameness descended on
half a continent.
   Today, there is unparalleled pollution, outmoded factories,
struggling agriculture and a 10-year wait for a car or drafty
two-room apartment.
   Beginning in the mid-1960s, when Moscow granted some leeway,
Eastern Europe's economists tried to right wrongs. But
Czechoslovakia, the world's 10th wealthiest nation before World War
II, had its attempts crushed in a 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion.
   Hungary and Poland were more fortunate. By the early 1970s,
partial economic reforms, praised by the Western bankers who helped
finance them, seemed to put both en route to modernity and consumer
plenty.
   Almost two decades later, the Poles, Hungarians and Westerners to
whom the two nations owe a total $54 billion know they were wrong to
expect miracles from economies that were managed by corrupt,
inefficent systems dominated by one party.
   Now that Moscow is permitting the political change it once
forbade, the economic decay and falling living standards in Hungary
and Poland are two motors for reform.
   Politicians eager to satisfy their citizens' craving for Western
consumer goods are permitting more travel and private imports of
videos and other wonders they cannot produce or afford to buy for
precious hard currency.
   A key factor in the delay is the political difficulty of going
back on four decades of promises that the state will care for its
citizens.
   East bloc workers, whose universal maxim is that ``we pretend to
work, and they pretend to pay us,'' are generally disgusted with
Communism, but hardly enthusiastic about the austerity and
double-digit inflation reform has brought.
   Real repairs for the East's economic plight will involve deep
changes and take much longer than a year training course at the
U.S.-funded management school in Budapest.
   Poland and Hungary are ahead of their East bloc allies in
permitting foreign ownership of domestic companies and forging
hundreds of joint ventures with the West.
   In April, Hungary became the first East bloc country to allow a
state-owned enterprise, the relatively successful Tungsram light
bulb company, to be bought by Westerners, an Austrian consortium.
   Eagerly pursuing all possible sources of capital, Hungary broke
East bloc convention and forged diplomatic ties with South Korea.
Samsung Corp. is setting up its first Hungarian factory to
manufacture 300,000 color televisions a year.
   Both Poland and Hungary also have small, private banks. Hungary
even has a fledgling stock exchange.
   But the people who manage them, suave sophisticates who learned
their craft in New York or London, know how long it will be before
their enterprises resemble either.
   ``Ten years, perhaps,'' shrugged the young manager of a new
Austro-Hungarian banking venture.

<HEAD>Coming in From the Cold: Cheltenham Turning From Spas to Spies</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The CIA laughed and British intelligence wouldn't
comment, but with or without help from the pros, the spa town of
Cheltenham is set to blow the cover on the spy business.
   Playing on its fame as the home to the government's top secret
intelligence-gathering headquarters, the town of 86,000 people in
southwest England plans to open the only museum of espionage outside
Havana, tourism officer Peter Rollins said Tuesday.
   The tourism department needs only the OK from the town council,
and if all goes well, the ``Espionage Center'' will open next year,
offering exhibits on spies through the ages and the state of the
profession today, Rollins said in an interview.
   ``We've got a lovely town but not a lot to do if it's raining,''
said Rollins of the town where the fashionable once flocked to take
mineral waters. ``I thought, what would be appropriate for the town
but unique as well?''
   When people were asked what they associated with Cheltenham, ``a
heck of a lot of people said, `Oh yes, that's where GCHQ is based.'
So we thought, `Well why not an espionage center?'''
   GCHQ _ Government Communications Headquarters _ is NATO's
European center for electronic eavesdropping. The secretive spy
center was sounded out and gave a cautious nod to the plan, said
Rollins.
   ``We've kept them in contact from the very beginning,'' he said.
``Their answer is that they had no comment either way, but as long
as it didn't endanger security, they had no objection.''
   A Ministry of Defense spokesman said MI5 and MI6, the domestic
and foreign espionage agencies, could not comment. ``Officially they
don't exist so they can't comment,'' he said, requesting anonymity.
   Response from the CIA was more jovial, said Rollins.
   ``The CIA had a great laugh when they were told. They thought it
was a great idea,'' said Rollins, quoting from a local newspaper
that had called the U.S. intelligence agency for comment.
   He added the CIA was the only agency that had heard of anything
at all resembling such a museum, and that was in Havana, said
Rollins.
   During the April visit of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
to Havana, reporters were taken on a tour of the Museum of State
Security, which displayed the scorched tail of a small plane,
plastic explosives and other artifacts of what Cubans billed as
their struggle against the CIA and dissident Cubans accused of
trying to kill or overthrow Fidel Castro.
   Rollins said planners of the Cheltenham museum haven't sought the
cooperation of intelligence agencies too strenuously, although they
would love ``the benefit of their experience.''
   But he said he wanted to make clear that ``the last thing we want
to do is poke fun at or belittle what they do.''
   The museum will cost $1.2 million. A joint venture with a private
company, it will be housed in a three-story reconverted arts center.
   So far, the town's leisure committee and tourism officials have
given unanimous support and Rollins is confident the town council
will approve it.
   Exhibits will tell the tales of famous spies, explore the
popularity of spy novels, and recreate a classroom where spies learn
their craft. Officials hope for 100,000 visitors the first year
   ``If you think about it, there's a lot to it,'' said Rollins.
``It's one of the oldest professions going. It's a worldwide
affair.''

   The personal assets of Prime Minister Sousuke Uno
and his wife total $2.1 million, the second largest in Japan's
22-member Cabinet, an official at the prime minister's residence
announced.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity Tuesday, said
the 66-year-old Uno's assets included 2.4 acres of land and his
residence in Shiga, 200 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The assets of Chief Cabinet Secretary Masajuro Shiokawa and his
wife were the largest among Cabinet ministers, totaling $9.3
million. They include $8.9 million worth of land in Osaka, Japan's
second largest city.
   The assets of Justice Minister Kazuo Tanikawa, his wife and three
children totaled $155,000, smallest among the Cabinet ministers.
   Cabinet ministers have been making their personal assets public
since 1984. The official said that for the first time, the Uno
Cabinet also disclosed the assets of parliamentary vice ministers
and their families.
   Uno's Cabinet was inaugurated June 2 after his predecessor,
Noboru Takeshita, resigned to take responsibility for an
influence-peddling scandal.
   The disclosure of assets began after the bribery conviction of
former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka raised questions of political
morality that caused electoral setbacks for the governing Liberal
Democratic Party.

   Laurence Legere has watched NATO develop
from a fledgling alliance dominated by the United States into one
that reflects Western Europe's increasing preoccupation with its own
interests and destiny.
   Legere, 70, is ending a career that took him to Normandy in World
War II, the White House during the Cuban missile crisis and to
Europe as the Defense Department's top civilian outside Washington.
   His last job, defense adviser to the U.S. Mission to NATO since
1974, has given him a close look at his country's European allies.
   ``I really have the feeling of ... a time of great change,''
Legere said in a recent interview at North Atlantic Treaty
Organization headquarters in Brussels. ``It will be fascinating to
watch.''
   He is retiring to North Carolina after 15 years of advising
American defense secretaries on sensitive security issues.
Reflecting on his experiences, he said:
   ``The Europeans are thinking differently. The people coming to
power now ... didn't experience World War II'' and are less reliant
on the United States.
   ``When we were the real leaders of the alliance, damn near
anything we said went,'' Legere said. ``They were good at
calibrating how serious the United States was about something.''
   When a new president was elected, Europeans wondered, ``What was
Jimmy Carter going to do ... what was this cowboy Reagan going to be
like,'' he said, but there was less of that in May during President
Bush's first summit of the 16-nation alliance.
   ``They don't feel as dependent on where an administration is
going to go,'' he said. ``They are beginning to feel more European
about all this.''
   Much of Western Europe's new closeness stems from the plan of the
12-nation European Economic Community to form a single market in
late 1992, ending the many trade barriers that now exist.
   ``The idea of Europe is very much on the move,'' Legere said.
   Relations with the Soviet Union, once eyed suspiciously in
Western Europe, also have changed since Mikhail S. Gorbachev gained
control of the Kremlin in 1985.
   ``You've got people who don't consider the Soviet Union the evil
empire or evil incarnate,'' Legere said, but recommended caution in
case Gorbachev doesn't last.
   Even with reduced tension in Europe, Legere feels there is room
for the defensive alliance linking the United States and Canada with
their European allies.
   ``The question is what kind of a place and doing what,'' he said.
``My own view is that NATO will continue to play a vital role in
military defense and defense questions. It's just the only place
that it can be done.''
   He does not believe Europe will become strong enough to replace
the United States as a global power.
   ``We are still the superpower,'' he said. ``Even an ideally and
perfectly united Europe, which won't happen, would not be in the
league with us and the Soviet Union.''
   Legere spiced his remembrances with tales of naive American
politicians crossing the Atlantic to offer their views on defense
matters.
   Years ago, he said, one such told Soviet arms negotiators Moscow
and Washington avoid complicated bargaining and just pull out a
large number of forces from Europe.
   ``You don't say these kinds of things in that sort of company and
I can remember the Russians being really nonplussed by it,'' Legere
said.
   He was born on Jan. 2, 1919, in Fitchburg, Mass., attended West
Point at age 17 and retired from the Army as a colonel in 1966.
   On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Legere was wounded after parachuting
behind Utah Beach in France, which interfered with his plans. He was
carrying a dress uniform and two bottles of scotch, because ``I was
convinced we were going to be in Paris in about two weeks and I
didn't want to be caught short.''
   His career included several stints as a White House adviser.
   In October 1962, it was his responsibility to awaken President
John F. Kennedy with important developments. A long, rambling cable
arrived from Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev during the night.
   ``I read that thing a dozen times all night long, and I did
nothing,'' Legere said. ``I'll never know whether I did the right
thing or not.''
   Next day, the National Security Council began debating what to
do, and was still at it in the evening.
   ``This could be the last night of my life, and a lot of other
people's,'' Legere said. He added, with a laugh, that he went to a
nearby hotel ``and got smashed.''

   A week of flooding in coastal and southern China
has claimed more than 100 lives, left tens of thousands of people
homeless and caused dikes along major rivers to burst, official
reports said today.
   The flooding across five provinces has destroyed thousands of
homes, the China Daily newspaper said, adding that 44 people had
died in Jiangxi province.
   The People's Daily said 31 people were killed and 73 injured in
coastal Zhejiang since torrential rains began falling June 27.
   Areas of western Zhejiang have received between 12 and 20 inches,
and rain was continuing, the paper said.
   Earlier reports said 28 people were killed in southeastern
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and three people died in
Qinghai province, a normally arid region of northwestern China.
   Heavy rains and flooding also have hit Fujian province. State
television has shown people wading through waist-high water.
   Most of the flooded areas were hit last year by severe drought.

   Their love of Old Glory stirred by the nation's highest court,
Americans waved the flag with a passion July Fourth, handing out
thousands of new ones and reverently retiring old and tattered ones
by burning them.
   A medal of liberty was awarded to Polish union leader Lech Walesa
in Philadelphia, a Cuban immigrant threw open his home in gratitude
to his adopted country, and Winthrop Paul Rockefeller, a
great-grandson of Standard Oil founder John D. Rockefeller, put on
an Arkansas fireworks display that drew 100,000.
   Seven Chinese students at the University of Tulsa in Oklahoma
used an Independence Day ceremony to announce they want political
asylum in the United States.
   ``We want to publicly denounce the Chinese government by asking
for asylum,'' said graduate student Guohua Zheng, 25.
   In Boston, the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of
Massachusetts observed the holiday by honoring the fallen
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   About 200,000 people turned out for the annual Boston Pops
concert at the Hatch Shell on the Esplanade at night. The music was
capped with a fireworks display.
   New York City celebrated with a spectacular 30-minute nighttime
fireworks display that included a Liberty Bell, space rocket and
star formations and ``America'' written across the sky.
   Earlier, about 2 million people packed the beach and boardwalk at
Coney Island to watch an air show featuring F-16 jet maneuvers and
Green Berets parachuting from helicopters, said show chairman Milton
Berger.
   In Seattle, about 500 people representing 51 countries became
Americans as hundreds of others, including two congressmen, welcomed
them on a rare sunny Fourth of July in Seattle.
   They weren't so lucky in the nation's capital, where it rained on
the estimated 20,000 people who turned out for the annual Fourth of
July parade.
   ``Everybody was smiling and being more congenial because we had
the bad weather as a common denominator,'' said John Shaw, who came
to Washington from Augusta, Maine.
   However, at the annual fireworks at the Washington Monument that
followed, two people were shot and wounded, and several others
suffered minor injuries when they were reportedly trampled, police
said.
   About 400,000 people turned out for the fireworks, police said.
   At the Arkansas site where the fireworks display was held,
Rockefeller, son of the state's late governor, said there's more to
the celebration he's sponsored for the last 10 years than money.
   ``I love it,'' he said. ``To see the kids and the older folks,
the people who fought to keep this country free, it's just a
humdinger of a Fourth of July.''
   Thousands of flags were given away in Milwaukee and Chicago, and
aging hippies at a counterculture gathering in Nevada displayed the
Stars and Stripes, and a week after the Supreme Court ruled that
burning the flag in protest is protected by the Constitution,
American Legion posts retired old flags by burning them.
   ``It's the proper way to burn any tattered, torn flag that needs
to be destroyed,'' said John Comer as Legionnaires in Manchester,
Mass., destroyed 50 old flags in a ceremony that traditionally
includes prayers.
   In Newport News, Va., Vice President Dan Quayle defended the Bush
administration's proposal to ban flag burning.
   ``Around the world, Old Glory is recognized and revered as the
symbol of freedom. Too many Americans have laid down their lives in
the defense of freedom to treat this symbol lightly,'' Quayle said
at a ceremony to honor the USS Newport News, the Navy's newest
submarine.
   Just outside Miami, Cuban immigrant and exporter Eduardo Martinez
again threw open his Hacienda Mardenpaz to tens of thousands. As
visitors examined scaled-down versions of the White House and the
Statue of Liberty, bands played a mixture of Latin music, country
and rock.
   ``I do this as a tribute to America because we are very grateful
to this country,'' he said.
   Solidarity leader Walesa was hailed for ``his personal triumph''
of hope in Poland as his wife accepted Philadelphia's first Liberty
Medal and a $100,000 cash award on his behalf in a ceremony outside
Independence Hall.
   ``The timing of this Philadelphia Liberty Medal award coincides
with a particular moment in Poland,'' said Danuta Walesa, speaking
for her husband. ``Our many years of struggle for the right to our
own nation is entering into its decisive phase.''
   She referred to Tuesday's events in Warsaw, where for the first
time since the late 1940s an opposition group was installed in a
Soviet bloc legislature. A total of 259 Solidarity deputies and
senators took their seats in the National Assembly next to members
of a communist coalition.
   The mood was more outrage than solidarity in Boston, where more
than 3,000 abortion rights activists protested Monday's Supreme
Court ruling on a Missouri abortion case.
   ``How ironic that the Supreme Court is poised to take away a
cherished right when the nation is commemorating our extraordinary
tradition of individual liberty,'' said Pam Nourse, director of Mass
Choice.
   In Milwaukee, about 18 volunteers were cheered by passersby as
they placed some 1,500 flags along the streets. ``People were
honking their horns, giving me the peace sign and giving me thumbs
up,'' said Marietta Redding. ``I love apple pie, grandmas and the
flag.''
   In Chicago, businessman Ted Kamberos played flag elf for the
third year, planting 1,000 American flags along the streets with
help from a dozen friends. ``There are so few people in America who
would consider burning a flag. They've given this gentleman a stage
and I think they're making a lot of hoopla about nothing,'' the
41-year-old Greek immigrant said of the Supreme Court decision that
upheld a protester's right to burn the flag.
   American flags fluttered at the 18th annual Rainbow Family of
Living Light reunion of more than 5,000 people in Nevada's Humboldt
National Forest. ``This Independence Day means a lot to me, because
it means freedom from power, from authority,'' said Linda Edwards,
45, a Santa Cruz, Calif., activist for the homeless.

<HEAD>Art Panel Leaves Sculpture Honoring Military Women Without Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American Legion post that raised $68,000 for a
sculpture honoring women who served in the nation's military during
wartime finds itself with a statue and no place to put it.
   The plan had been to set up the half-ton statue in Veterans
Memorial Plaza, part of a city park that Legion Post 272 maintains
under agreement with the Parks Department.
   The Legionnaires thought they had clear sailing from the
department when they made arrangements with sculptor Eileen Barry.
   But the city Art Commission, which has the final say on whether a
sculpture or other art may be displayed on city property, recently
rejected the 8-foot bronze of a women in fatigues and combat boots,
calling it ``not strong enough artistically.''
   Jerry Klein, treasurer of Post 272 in the Queens borough, said he
had never heard of the commission when the project got started in
1986.
   ``We thought we would have to work just with the Parks
Department. At some point in the project, after the contract had
been signed, that's when we heard there was an Art Commission,''
Klein said.
   Parks Commissioner Henry Stern said his department always informs
donors that Arts Commission approval is required. ``Nobody would
tell them to make a statue without first getting it approved'' in
the design stage, Stern said.
   Mrs. Barry said she was shocked by the commission's opinion of
the statue, which is nearly complete.
   ``Anyone who sees this has nothing but comment that she's strong,
she's powerful,'' Mrs. Barry said.
   Despite the denial of a permanent site for the statue, the Parks
Department has said it may stand temporarily at a city site across
the street from the Rockaway park. Art Commission approval is
unnecessary for display of less than a year.
   ``It just gives us some breathing room,'' said Klein. ``We still
have to get a permanent site.''

   Move over, Paris. Tokyo will join you in the ranks
of cities with eight-digit phone numbers.
   Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. said Tuesday that the change
from seven-digit phone numbers in Tokyo will take place Jan. 1,
1991. Subscribers will add a 3 at the beginning of their seven-digit
numbers.
   The national telephone utility said a shortage of exchange
numbers began showing up in 1981 as demand increased for facsimile
and microcomputer communications on top of demand for regular
telephone lines.
   Some eight-digit phone numbers were given to pocket pagers in
1987, and in 1988 some new subscribers for regular phones received
eight-digit numbers, NTT said, but by early 1991 the shortage will
be acute.
   Unlike in France, which has had eight-digit local phone numbers
throughout the country for several years, the change in Japan will
affect only phone numbers in Tokyo, a city of 12 million people.

   Firefighters racing rising
temperatures Tuesday contained a blaze that leveled 13 homes,
damaged eight others, charred 1,500 acres of brush and did $4.3
million damage in an exclusive hillside neighborhood.
   ``We should get control of it pretty soon,'' Joe Silva of the Los
Angeles County Fire Department said after the fire was declared
contained at 5:20 p.m.
   Cool, humid night air slowed the blaze after it ravaged the
neighborhood Monday, and about half of the roughly 1,000
firefighters were allowed to go home, Silva said.
   But temperatures soared as high as 109 degrees and winds were up
to 12 mph.
   And, in the San Bernardino National Forest, a new blaze burned
150 acres in Santa Ana Canyon about 70 miles east of Los Angeles.
   About 200 firefighters were dispatched, and six fire-retardant
dropping planes and three helicopters attacked the blaze, said
Bureau of Land Management dispatcher Allyn Harrington.
   Elsewhere, fire crews battled forest and brush fires in mostly
remote areas of Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and New Mexico, where a
large fire threatened an endangered species of trout.
   Police allowed residents back into the Turnbull Canyon area, 20
miles east of downtown Los Angeles, early Tuesday to survey the
damage in the neighborhood, where homes are valued at $300,000 to
more than $1 million.
   ``We realize how important it was for people to go back in and
check. Some were going crazy,'' said Capt. Garry Oversby.
   Thirteen homes were destroyed and eight sustained major damage,
Silva said. Damage to property and land was estimated at at least $4
million.
   Four people were arrested for looting late Monday, Silva said.
``I cannot believe they would want to take more from people who
already have lost almost everything,'' he said.
   Don Younger said he had been visiting friends Monday when he saw
a plume of black smoke from his neighborhood. When he tried to drive
home fire officials would not allow him through, so he drove to a
hill where he could watch.
   ``I saw the firefighters down on their bellies saving my home. I
wish I could hug them all,'' he said. The blaze destroyed a small
structure behind his home containing about $20,000 worth of amateur
radio equipment.
   Younger said his house, which he valued at $250,000, sustained
some $12,000 in fire damage in 1968.
   Two houses down, Jim Ahrens swept up ashes and charred wood
inside an addition to his home that was to have been an exercise
room. He also lost a bathroom. ``It could have been a lot worse,''
he said.
   About 300 evacuees registered at a shelter at a high school,
mostly to let relatives know they were safe, then spent the night
with friends or family, said Robert Crompton, disaster services
chairman of the American Red Cross.
   The fire was believed to have been caused by people, fire
Inspector John Lenihan said. It began in a brushy area and spread
quickly to homes.
   ``There was no reason for anyone to have been there,'' he said of
the area where the fire started.
   In southwestern New Mexico, a wind-driven fire had charred about
5,000 acres near Diamond Peak in the Gila National Forest. Forest
Service spokesman Ken Palmrose said crews had to use hand tools on
the fire line in steep terrain straddling the Continental Divide at
9,000 feet.
   Nearly 850 people, six air tankers and seven helicopters fought
the fire, which was started by lightning Friday and spread by 30 mph
wind.
   The fire threatened the Gila trout, which are listed as an
endangered species, a U.S. Forest Service spokesman said
   ``Some people might not understand how fish can be threatened by
fire, but these are creeks with very little water,'' said Ken
Palmrose. ``The fish might be in little pools or in an area with
very little stream flow.''
   Biologists planned to use nets to catch as many Gila trout as
possible and bring them to a hatchery.
   Several fires in Colorado had been contained or controlled, but
the Box Canyon fire, south of Dinosaur National Monument, grew to
1,800 acres Tuesday and entered the Skull Creek Wilderness Study
Area.
   Firefighters also battled extreme heat and low humidity to
suppress fires in eastern and southern Utah, while a new blaze
charred more than 1,000 acres in the Uintah Basin, forcing
evacuation of all campgrounds in the area.
   In Wyoming, a fire that scorched 400 acres in the Bridger-Teton
National Forest was expected to burn up to 1,000 acres before crews
could extinguish it, said U.S. Forest Service spokesman Fred
Kingwill.
   The fire is the first significant blaze in the forest so far this
year, he said.

<HEAD>Negroponte Presents Credentials in Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   New U.S. Ambassador John D. Negroponte says
there is no basis to fears expressed in Mexico that his appointment
is a sign of intentions by Washington to intervene in Mexico's
internal affairs.
   ``Those fears are completely without foundation,'' Negroponte
said Monday, replying to a question from a Mexican journalist after
presenting his credentials to President Carlos Salinas de Gortari at
the National Palace.
   Many Mexican commentators speculated on the meaning of
Negroponte's appointment, noting that he was ambassador to Honduras
during the buildup of the Nicaraguan Contra rebel movement there.
   Because of a history of conflicts starting with the Mexican War
in 1846, Mexicans are highly sensitive to any hint of U.S.
interventionism.
   ``It is not my intention to bring about intervention of any
sort,'' Negroponte said. ``I want to promote good relations between
the two nations.''
   Speaking in Spanish, Negroponte noted in a statement that he was
a 28-year career diplomat and said there was no ``relationship more
important than the relationship between Mexico and the United
States.''
   He said he was anxious to ``build on the spirit of Houston,''
where Salinas and President Bush met last November, before either
had taken office.
   In a brief question and answer session after the ceremony,
Negroponte praised the Salinas administration's effort to fight drug
trafficking.
   ``The United States is very satisfied with the collaboration that
has developed between our two governments,'' Negroponte said.
   Asked what he thought of Mexico's policies in Central America,
Negroponte said the main issues between the two nations are
bilateral.
   ``Naturally our governments will sometimes exchange points of
view on other themes, but always on the basis of mutual respect,''
Negroponte said, using a phrase _ ``mutual respect'' _ that is a
keynote for politicians here when they discuss relations with the
United States.
   Under the administration of President Miguel de la Madrid, Mexico
opposed U.S. policy in Central America, particularly its support of
the Contra rebels who fought the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua.
   But in May, when tensions rose between the United States and the
Panama over what Washington called a fraudulent election and over
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's role in the government, Mexico
temporarily withdrew its envoy to Panama _ an almost unprecedented
display of support for a U.S. position.
   Negroponte's role in the Contra buildup figured during the
confirmation process in the U.S. Senate following his nomination by
Bush, but he was confirmed easily.
   The 50-year-old diplomat served as ambassador to Honduras from
1981 to 1985, then served in the White House as part of the national
security staff.

<HEAD>Defense Says Prison for North Would Encourage Use of Scapegoats</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for Oliver North say imprisoning the
former presidential aide would only encourage high-level government
officials to evade responsibility for legally risky activity.
   Responding to the prosecution's call for a prison term for North,
defense lawyers said in court papers Monday that ``a sentence of
imprisonment would be cruel and unjust.''
   ``Such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally unfair,'' the
defense said in the pre-sentence memo filed in U.S. District Court.
   The 45-year-old former National Security Council aide is
scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday for three felony convictions
arising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.
   He faces up to 10 years in prison and $750,000 in fines for
aiding and abetting the obstruction of a congressional inquiry into
the affair, destroying or altering government documents and
illegally accepting the installation of a security fence outside his
home by arms dealer Richard Secord.
   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has asked U.S. District
Judge Gerhard Gesell to send the retired Marine lieutenant colonel
to prison, arguing that North defied Congress and lied at his trial
to win acquittal of other charges.
   But defense lawyers led by Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said the
prosecution's request ``demonstrates that it will stop at nothing in
its effort to crush Oliver North.''
   The prosecution ``does not offer evidence to support these
charges; it plainly assumes that if it throws enough mud, some will
stick,'' the defense said. Repeating an argument made during the
eight-week trial, North's lawyers said he was mostly charged with
activities that were ``authorized by his superiors.''
   ``A prison sentence for Lt. Col. North would not deter high
government officials from using their subordinates to carry out
actions that are legally or politically risky,'' the defense brief
said.
   ``It would not escape notice of such officials if Oliver North
were to go to prison while others remain in government in positions
of power or return to private-sector sinecures,'' the defense said.
   ```Those who created this situation have walked away from it,'''
the defense said, quoting from a letter to the court by Noel Koch, a
former deputy assistant secretary of defense.
   Imprisoning North, Koch wrote, ``will only reassure those who use
young men like him that they can do it with impunity.''
   North has suffered enough punishment with his dismissal from the
White House staff and the threat of the loss of his Marine Corps
pension as well as ``unrelenting and often hostile press scrutiny''
for 2{ years, the defense said.
   If the court feels that further punishment is warranted, the
defense said, it ``should take the form of probation conditioned on
community service.''
   In a related action, Iran-Contra prosecutors opposed a request by
Joseph Fernandez to subpoena former President Reagan to testify at
Fernandez's trial on charges of lying about his role in helping arm
the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Walsh's office said testimony by Reagan about his support for the
Contras was irrelevant to charges that Fernandez lied when
questioned by a presidential commission and his CIA superiors about
his efforts to set up an airstrip in Costa Rica for the Contra
resupply network.
   Fernandez, former CIA station chief in Costa Rica, is scheduled
to stand trial July 24 in federal court in Alexandria, Va.

<HEAD>Bush Isn't Fulfilling Promise to be Education President, NEA Leader
Says</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDS: Top prospects uncertain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is not living up to his promise
to be the education president thus far, says the National Education
Association's new leader.
   ``He seems to be floundering,'' Keith Geiger said Monday after he
was elected president of the 2-million-member teacher union. ``We
simply don't see where he wants to take the country in education.
Right now we have nothing to debate because they're not saying
anything. We're very frustrated.''
   Geiger, who has been vice president of the union for six years,
had few good things to say about one of the only education
initiatives the president has pushed: allowing parents to choose
which public school their children will attend.
   The NEA Representative Assembly was debating the choice issue
today at its annual convention. The 8,500 delegates were considering
several proposals ranging from outright opposition to qualified
opposition to the idea of letting parents choose their children's
public schools.
   Geiger said he favored a policy that would oppose choice but
allow flexibility for magnet schools, alternative schools and other
option programs.
   ``We are not going to be very supportive'' of most existing
choice programs, the president-elect said, because they do not pay
for student transportation and tend to shortchange the schools left
behind. Only one plan, in Seattle, gives money to the school
abandoned by the student so it can improve, he said.
   ``We need to raise the level of the education that's going on in
all buildings, not just a few buildings and let some kids escape,''
Geiger said.
   What does the NEA want from Bush? Full funding of proven federal
education programs that serve disadvantaged, handicapped and
vocational students; a major presidential speech outlining Bush's
education goals; and a presidential proposal designed to attract
young students to the teaching profession, Geiger said.
   The former math and science teacher takes office at the end of
the summer. He said he will keep the huge union, the country's
largest and among its most politically powerful, on the path set by
outgoing president Mary Futrell.
   She is widely credited with bringing teachers into the mainstream
of the education reform movement through teacher leadership
training, dropout prevention and literacy programs as well as a
relatively flexible attitude on issues such as teacher certification
and merit pay.
   ``You will not see a big about-face in this organization,''
Geiger said. But he said he will push some of his own ideas,
including efforts to enact collective bargaining laws in two to four
states the NEA identifies as ripe for such action.
   ``I don't believe any employee in any school district in America
today should be working without being under a collective bargaining
agreement,'' Geiger said.
   About 17 states do not have collective bargaining laws, he said.
He cited Georgia as one possible site of NEA activity; an aide said
New Mexico may also be a target.
   Geiger, 48, of Livonia, Mich., won the NEA presidency with 4,870
votes to 3,600 for executive committee member John Wilson of
Raleigh, N.C.
   A veteran contract negotiator and former president of his state
education association, Geiger presented himself as tough but
flexible.
   Wilson, a special education teacher with a fiery style, pitched
himself as the activist candidate and made impassioned attacks on
merit pay and ``educational bureaucrats'' in his campaign literature
and speeches.

   Proposed restrictions on abortion are waiting
in the wings in many states now that the Supreme Court has approved
such limits, say activists on both sides of the issue.
   Monday's decision did not impose immediate restrictions in any
state other than Missouri, the state affected by the case.
   But Dawn Johnsen, legal counsel of the National Abortion Rights
Action League, said over 250 abortion-related bills were introduced
in various states in 1988 and 1989.
   ``All but a handful of states had some activity,'' she said. ``I
expect that the court's decision will encourage state legislatures
to introduce numerous restrictions on abortions.''
   Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to
Life Committee, said he thought the quickest impact may come from
courts that have enjoined laws in various states.
   ``Now those lower courts will review some of those injunctions,''
he said.
   He called the decision ``an invitation by the court to the states
to begin to restore protection to unborn children.'' And, Johnson
added, ``I'm sure that a number of legislatures will accept the
invitation.''
   Most state legislatures are not in session at this time of year,
he noted, and there is time to analyze the decision and enact new
laws.
   ``The telephones are ringing off the hook,'' said Sue Roselle,
executive director of Women's Health Services Inc. of Pittsburgh, a
non-profit clinic that performs about 7,000 abortions per year.
   ``Women are saying, `I want my abortion now before they change
the law,''' she said.
   Eve Paul, vice president for legal affairs for Planned Parenthood
Federation of America, said the decision ``is just opening it up for
endless battles in the legislatures and the courts.
   ``We expect many states to enact laws that restrict abortion
rights in a variety of ways,'' she said. ``We expect to be in court
challenging many of those. I think they will start off with
provisions that are similar to the Missouri law.''
   Ms. Paul said, too, that women's rights groups will indicate to
legislators that abortion will be a key election issue next year.
   ``People, women in particular, are not very conscious of the role
that state legislatures played in their lives,'' she said. ``This
opens the way for a lot more public concern as to who is my state
legislator and what is his position on abortion.''
   In the past decade, about 1.5 million legal abortions have been
performed each year.
   In Louisiana, Attorney General William Guste said the decision
might warrant reconsideration of a law, declared unconstitutional in
1982, that requires ultrasound testing of a fetus prior to any
abortion. But he declined to speculate what the legislature might do.
   Some state legislators are predicting there won't be much action
in their states as a result of the rulings.
   ``I would anticipate a lot of sound and fury but no substantive
action by the legislature next year,'' said Washington State House
Speaker Joe King. ``After all, Washington voters approved of
abortion and the spending of state money to pay for abortion.''
   And in New York state, with the most liberal laws in the country,
chances are thought slim that the laws will be tightened. Women's
groups will be mobilized to hold the line, said Shirley Gordon,
executive director of Family Planning Advocates of New York State.

<HEAD>What Officials, Activists Say About Abortion Ruling</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Scotus-Abortion Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from statements and
interviews of government officials and activists on both sides of
the abortion issue reacting to the Supreme Court decision on
abortion.
   President Bush: ``... the court appears to have begun to restore
to the people the ability to protect the unborn ... We continue to
believe that Roe vs. Wade was incorrectly decided and should be
reversed.''
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh: ``... those of us opposed to
abortion on demand can take heart that a majority of the justices
have seen fit to give the states greater leeway in establishing
appropriate limitations on abortion.''
   Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.: ``What today did was made women
wards of the state. We're the only ones in the whole Western
civilized world with this ruling.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio: ``The decision should serve as a
rallying cry to women everywhere to fight these back door attempts
to limit their right to privacy.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.: ``By cutting back on Roe vs. Wade,
the court has seriously undermined the Constitution's protection of
women in our society.''
   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.: The ruling is ``the first big step
toward overturning Roe vs. Wade and another step toward the end of
the killing of prenatal infants.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah: ``I remain hopeful the court will soon
overturn Roe outright.''
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif.: ``It won't stop abortions. It will
only make many unsafe abortions likely.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.: ``Overwhelmingly, poor women
unable to travel from state to state will be the losers _ and the
casualties of self-induced and back-alley abortions.''
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.: The ruling ``is a significant
victory for unborn children and will likely result in the saving of
many children who otherwise would have been aborted.''
   Faye Wattleton, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of
America: ``Now a woman's access to abortion may become hostage to
geography, as states enact a patchwork of laws and regulations aimed
at blocking abortion.''
   John Willke, president of National Right to Life Committee: The
ruling ``begins the process of restoring a fundamental right of the
American people _ the right to protect human life.''
   Kate Michelman, executive director of National Abortion Rights
Action League: ``Women's lives hang by a thread, and the justices
this morning handed politicians a pair of scissors.''
   National Abortion Federation: ``Whether a woman can exercise her
constitutional right to abortion will increasingly depend on where
she lives, how much money she has and how far she is able to
travel.''
   Norma McCorvey, who as ``Jane Roe'' brought the lawsuit that led
to the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision: ``It saddens my heart very deeply
to know that poor women are once again going to be out there going
to backstreet abortions and possibly be mutilated and not have the
right to choose.''
   Randall Terry, national director of Operation Rescue: ``It's a
faltering step under which children will continue to be murdered,
but this decision indicates that Roe's days are numbered.''
   National Conference of Catholic Bishops, by its president,
Archbishop John L. May of St. Louis: ``The court's decision is a
victory for life. And the bggest winners today are the tiniest
people of all _ children within the womb.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women:
``This is war against women.''
   Judith Widdecombe, founder of Reproductive Health Services, the
Missouri clinic involved in the lawsuit that led to Monday's
decision: ``This is the beginning of a war. It will become our
Vietnam of the 1990s.'''
   Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, national executive director of the YWCA
of the U.S.A.: ``For all women, this decision threatens our civil
liberties and our economic security, our privacy and our health.''
   Janet Benshoop of the American Civil Liberties Union: ``Today's
decision strikes a blow to all Americans who look to the
Constitution and the Supreme Court to safeguard their privacy and
freedom.''
   Committee for Family America: ``Clearly Roe is in its death
throes. ... The end to `constitutional' abortion is in sight.''

   ``Batman'' soared into the box office
stratosphere by becoming the first movie to make $100 million within
10 days.
   ``Batman'' grossed a record $30.1 million during its second
weekend of release, according to Exhibitor Relations Co.
   ``Batman,'' starring Michael Keaton in the title role and Jack
Nicholson as his comic antagonist, the Joker, set the previous
weekend mark with $42.7 million in its first three days.
   If it continues on its winged way, ``Batman'' could well become
the highest-grossing movie yet, topping the $228.6 million set by
1982's ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial.''
   The former record-holder for the fastest $100 million was
``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' which passed the barrier
after 19 days last month.
   Meanwhile, Spike Lee's much talked-about ``Do the Right Thing''
generated vigorous business in its debut. The emotional and often
comic race-relations drama collected $3.6 million while playing in
only several hundred theaters.
   ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' the family comedy starring Rick
Moranis, held strongly in second place, grossing $13.1 million
during the weekend.
   In third, selling $10.4 million worth of tickets during its
opening weekend, was the critically panned ``The Karate Kid Part
III,'' starring 27-year-old Ralph Macchio.
   In fourth place was the fading comedy ``Ghostbusters II,'' with
Bill Murray and Dan Aykroyd, which dropped from $13.9 million one
weekend ago to $9 million this past weekend. It was followed by
Steven Spielberg's adventure sequel ``Indiana Jones and the Last
Crusade,'' landing in fifth with $7.1 million.
   The bittersweet coming-of-age drama ``Dead Poets Society''
starring Robin Williams continued to draw large crowds, collecting
$6.7 million to finish in sixth place.
   The much-hyped but poorly reviewed ``Great Balls of Fire!''
opened to spectacularly bad business, winding up in seventh place.
Despite its exclamation point, ``Great Balls of Fire!'' collected
only $3.8 million.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' on only 353 screens, grossed $3.6 million
to finish in eighth place. Universal has yet to announce if it will
add more screens for ``Do the Right Thing.''
   Rounding out the top 10 were William Shatner's ``Star Trek V: The
Final Frontier'' in ninth with $2.5 million, and the baseball
fantasy ``Field of Dreams,'' featuring Kevin Costner, in 10th with
$1.8 million.
   Here are the top movies for the weekend as tallied by Exhibitor
Relations, with distributor, weekend gross, number of theater
screens, average per screen, total gross and number of weeks in
release. Figures for ``Karate Kid III'' and ``Ghostbusters II'' are
estimated.
   1. ``Batman,'' Warner Bros., $30.1 million, 2,194 screens,
$13,708 per screen, $100.2 million, two weeks.
   2. ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids,'' Disney, $13.1 million, 1,431
screens, $9,161 per screen, $38 million, two weeks.
   3. ``The Karate Kid Part III,'' Columbia, $10.4 million, 1,560
screens, $6,667 per screen, $10.4 million, one week.
   4. ``Ghostbusters II,'' Columbia, $9 million, 2,410 screens,
$3,734 per screen, $74.5 million, three weeks.
   5. ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,'' Paramount, $7.1
million, 2,103 screens, $3,371 per screen, $147.3 million, six weeks.
   6. ``Dead Poets Society,'' Disney, $6.7 million, 1,109 screens,
$6,049 per screen, $46.3 million, five weeks.
   7. ``Great Balls of Fire!'' Orion, $3.8 million, 1,417 screens,
$2,687 per screen, $3.8 million, one week.
   8. ``Do the Right Thing,'' Universal, $3.6 million, 353 screens,
$10,095 per screen, $3.6 million, one week.
   9. ``Star Trek V: The Final Frontier,'' Paramount, $2.5 million,
1,679 screens, $1,470 per screen, $42.5 million, four weeks.
   10. ``Field of Dreams,'' Universal, $1.8 million, 940 screens,
$1,920 per screen, $50.6 million, 11 weeks.

<HEAD>Chances Are That July 4 Firecracker Was Made in China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Most of the fireworks being set off to
celebrate American freedom this week were shipped from China before
that country's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, a
fireworks expert says.
   The Chinese have targeted the U.S. fireworks market since
relations improved during the Nixon administration and now dominate
the market, said John A. Conkling, a Maryland chemist who heads the
American Pyrotechnics Association.
   Conkling, who operates a seasonal ``Fireworks Hotline'' in
Washington, said shipments from China had either arrived or were
aboard vessels by the time the disturbances began that led to last
month's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of people were killed.
   ``I think the fact that for the past 15 years we've celebrated
Independence Day with fireworks coming from a communist country
means there has been an irony quite a while,'' he said. ``It is
heightened by the incidents this year.''
   Most fireworks used by Americans come from overseas, more than
half from China, he said, adding that the question concerning
possible trade sanctions would be, ``Whom do you punish?''
   In 1987, the latest year for which he had full statistics, 50
million pounds of fireworks came to the United States directly from
China and more than 10 million pounds came from China by way of Hong
Kong distributors. That left just 6 million pounds exported to the
United States by the rest of the world, including such former
fireworks-making giants as Taiwan and Macao.
   Most of the fireworks are of the backyard variety _ firecrackers,
Roman candles, skyrockets _ and not the kind seen at public displays.
   Commerce Department figures show Chinese shipments of
``explosives and pyrotechnics'' have risen steadily since 1983, when
they were valued at $33.4 million, to $51.2 million in 1987.
   The Chinese, who made ``fire lances'' with a mixture of
saltpeter, sulfur and charcoal as early as the 12th century, now
tailor their products for Americans.
   For instance, the Chinese began making sparklers because
Americans wanted them.
   Many of the fireworks on display at roadside stands still have
distinct oriental imagery: pagodas, blossoms and butterflies.
   A $13 package put together by a New Jersey company is called the
``Miss Liberty'' assortment. A few of the pieces in it are Chinese,
including one with unintended timeliness: A tiny Chinese-made paper
tank moves on the ground and ``emits flaming pellets.''
   For years, controversy over the Chinese imports has involved
safety rather than questions of politics or human rights in China.
   Last year, the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Customs
Service seized so many Chinese fireworks for bad labels, short fuses
or gunpowder overloads that the industry had to shut down for a time.
   Conkling was among a group of American experts who toured the
Chinese fireworks provinces last year to work with the makers on
safety standards.

   As many as a half-million people were expected
to celebrate Independence Day in the nation's capital today with a
full day of activities, beginning with a parade and ending with
fireworks.
   Stars scheduled for Fourth of July performances in Washington
included James Galway, Henry Mancini, Pearl Bailey, Peter Nero and
Gary Morris.
   Earle Kittleman, spokesman for the National Park Service, said
authorities were preparing for anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000
people to converge on the National Mall and nearby viewing points,
with several concerts leading up to the fireworks near the
Washington Monument.
   The forecast was for partly cloudy skies with scattered showers
and highs in the low to mid-80s.
   The day's major events were to begin with a parade along
Constitution Avenue before noon.
   Among the scheduled concerts was the National Symphony Orchestra,
which was to perform an evening concert on the west front of the
Capitol narrated by actor E.G. Marshall.
   In addition, singer Gary Morris was joining the Navy Band in a
performance at the Sylvan Theater, adjacent to the Washington
Monument, and the Air Force Band was performing on the steps of the
National Air and Space Museum.
   The city also had a day-long jazz festival set for Freedom Plaza
on Pennsylvania Avenue, two blocks from the White House.

   A star-spangled street was stripped of its
colors by bandits who made off with 33 American flags.
   Police said Monday they didn't know who took the flags from a
neighborhood's Fourth of July display.
   Residents of Lafayette's Ninth Street reported the flags stolen
during the weekend, police Sgt. Tony Roswarski said.
   Most of the flags were small, but one reportedly was a full-sized
flag used to cover the casket at a military funeral for the husband
of a neighborhood resident.
   ``We'd like to get that one back if we can,'' Roswarski said.

   A firestorm ripped through a suburban Los Angeles canyon Monday,
damaging or destroying up to 15 expensive homes and forcing the
evacuation of about 500 people as flames leapfrogged from brittle
brush to rooftops, officials said.
   The blaze in exclusive Turnbull Canyon burned as crews fought
wildfires in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Southern California that
have destroyed or damaged homes, injured at least 46 people and
consumed about 18,000 acres.
   Five water-dropping helicopters and about 450 firefighters
attempted to douse the fire as it raced along the ridge of homes
near Hacienda Heights about 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Erratic winds intensified by the flames, along with 100-degree
temperatures, caused problems for firefighters, said Los Angeles
County Fire Department spokeswoman Arden Beer.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries, said Los Angeles
County Fire Inspector John Lenihan.
   Thirteen to 15 homes were damaged or destroyed by the blaze,
Lenihan said. At least six appeared to have been destroyed.
   An estimated 600 acres burned as the fire hopscotched through
steep brush-filled canyons between the ridgetop homes and created a
long fireline through the hills, Linehan said.
   The cause of the fire was not immediately known, Lenihan said.
   A black plume of smoke several thousand feet high could be seen
for 20 miles. Neighborhood streets were abandoned, and some
residents turned on lawn sprinklers before fleeing. The few roads
leading into the area were closed.
   About 500 people arrived at Los Altos High School, which was
converted into an evacuation center, said Red Cross spokesman Rick
Diebold.
   ``Some of the people are extremely upset, particularly those who
have lost their homes,'' Diebold said. ``The rest, who aren't sure,
are glued to the television set.''
   Sharon and Dick Hartman waited out the blaze near the fire
command post, sitting beside a van loaded with four caged birds, two
dogs and household items. ``What we grabbed were animals and
heirlooms, '' Mrs. Hartman said.
   She estimated homes in the area were worth $350,000 to $1.5
million.
   In Tulare County southeast of Fresno, a fire erupted shortly
after 3 p.m., said county fire dispatcher Vivian Barnes.
   The grass and brush fire about 30 miles southeast of the county
seat of Visalia was out of control, and had consumed about 300
acres, Barnes said.
   Elsewhere in Southern California, crews gained the upper hand
over wildfires that covered 8,633 acres, but not before several
homes had been burned and dozens of people, mostly firefighters,
were injured.
   In Colorado, a forest fire that gained new life near the Dinosaur
National Monument over the weekend had spread to 1,520 acres by
Monday night. Firefighters closed in on another blaze that burned a
home and two cars west of Grand Junction.
   Fire danger was high.
   ``It's so dry, one firecracker will be enough,'' said Kris
Damsgaard of the U.S. Forest Service's Colorado office.
   The fire south of the monument and 70 miles west of Craig had
been declared near containment early Sunday, but erupted later in
the day and grew because of extremely dry conditions and rough
terrain, officials said.
   Air tankers and 95 firefighters from the BLM, Bureau of Indian
Affairs, Forest Service and other agencies fought the blaze, said
BLM spokeswoman Cathy Cahill.
   About 300 firefighters contained a 1,200-acre blaze that caused
an estimated $200,000 damage to a house, outbuilding and two cars in
Glade Park, 15 miles west of Grand Junction. The fire forced
evacuation of the hamlet for more than a day.
   Other Colorado fires ignited by dryness, heat and gusty winds
were contained or near containment Monday. They included an 800-acre
blaze north of Grand Junction and a 275-acre fire in Poudre Canyon
northwest of Fort Collins.
   In California, a fire near Lake Elsinore south of Los Angeles
blackened 7,880 acres of brush by Monday, but was contained with 23
miles of fire lines, said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Rosalinda
Ewen.
   ``We're nowhere near abandoning this fire yet,'' said Cleveland
National Forest spokesman Chuck Judd. ``With all these acres, we
will be here for a while.''
   The fire destroyed four vacation cabins, six mobile homes and one
house before it was surrounded late Sunday. The total cost of the
fire, including burned homes and firefighting costs, was estimated
at $2.4 million.
   Judd said all the injuries were minor and mostly involved smoke
inhalation.
   Also in California, fire crews were on the brink of controlling a
300-acre blaze in San Bernardino County, where 300 firefighters were
on the lines; a fire that destroyed 250 acres on Sunday in a canyon
was declared controlled; and a fire that burned 203 acres on the
edge of Sequoia National Park was extinguished Sunday.
   In southern New Mexico, nearly 550 firefighters battled a blaze
near Diamond Peak in the Gila National Forest that has scorched
2,500 acres.
   About 50 firefighters and two helicopters brought under control a
lightning-sparked fire on BLM land about 48 miles southwest of
Roswell, said Tim Kreager of the agency's Roswell District office.
The blaze burned 2,840 acres.
   In eastern Utah, an estimated 200 firefighters gradually closed
lines around a remote lightning-sparked blaze that has burned more
than 275 acres of forest and grass 23 miles southwest of Duchesne
and a lightning-sparked fire that has consumed more than 350 acres
30 miles south of Vernal, officials said.
   The Rough Canyon fire southwest of Duchesne is expected to be
contained by late Tuesday or early Wednesday, said Forest Service
spokesman Ray Tate. There was no estimate for when the other fire
might be contained.

   The Supreme Court's latest ruling on religious
displays on government property is a mixed blessing, say religious
groups and advocates of strict separation of church and state.
   Sholom D. Comay, President of the American Jewish Committee,
said, ``There is simply no religious need for the display of sacred
symbols of any faith in or at government buildings. There is ample
private space available.''
   ``We see this decision as a mixed bag,'' said Robert Boston, a
spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
   ``For the first time, the court has stated clearly that religious
displays standing alone at government buildings are
unconstitutional,'' he said. ``On the other hand, the court has said
they could be constitutional if surrounded by secular symbols. We
see that as a negative development.''
   The court ended its current term Monday by forbidding Christmas
nativity scenes and other religious displays on government property
if they convey an endorsement of religion.
   The ruling, while important, was overshadowed by a long-awaited
decision in which the court expanded state power to regulate
abortions.
   The court stopped short of reversing its 1973 decision legalizing
abortion, but agreed to hear three other abortion cases _ from
Minnesota, Illinois and Ohio _ when the justices take the bench
again in October.
   In other actions, the court:
   _Accepted its first-ever ``right to die'' case and agreed to
decide whether a Missouri family may order removal of a life-support
system from a woman in an irreversible vegetative condition.
   _Agreed to review a 1984 federal law requiring that student
religious groups be given the same access as other extracurricular
clubs to public high school facilities. The justices will decide
whether a Bible study group must be allowed to meet at an Omaha,
Neb., high school after class hours.
   In the religious-display case, the justices voted, 5-4, that a
Christmas nativity scene standing alone inside the Allegheny County
Courthouse in Pittsburgh violated the constitutionally required
separation of church and state.
   By a separate 6-3 vote, the court allowed a Hanukkah menorah one
block away on the front steps of Pittsburgh's City-County Building.
   The menorah, a nine-branched candelabra used during the Jewish
holiday Hanukkah, was surrounded by a much taller Christmas tree and
a sign saluting freedom.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said the
nativity scene or creche _ carrying signs hailing Jesus as the son
of God _ gave the impression the county was endorsing Christian
principles.
   ``Government may celebrate Christmas in some manner and form, but
not in a way that endorses Christian doctrine,'' he said. ``Here,
Allegheny County has transgressed this line.''
   He said the setting for the menorah, by contrast, had clear
secular overtones.
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, participating in his first
church-state case since joining the court in 1988, voted to permit
the nativity scene as well as the menorah.
   Kennedy said the court, in barring government sponsorship of the
creche, showed ``an unjustified hostility toward religion, a
hostility inconsistent with our history and our precedents.''
   ``Thank God for the Supreme Court,'' said Charles Saul, a
Pittsburgh attorney representing a Jewish group that owned the
menorah. ``The court is saying that when you put a menorah and a
Christmas tree and these kinds of things together, that all faiths
are welcome.''
   Monday's ruling relied heavily on a 1984 decision in which the
court upheld the constitutionality of a city-sponsored creche in
Pawtucket, R.I. That display included various secular symbols,
including Santa Claus and his reindeer.
   Ironically, Blackmun wrote a dissenting opinion in the Pawtucket
case.
   But he said Monday the latest ruling could clear up some of the
confusion engendered by the earlier decision.
   He said these are the guiding principles: ``The government's use
of religious symbolism is unconstitutional if it has the effect of
endorsing religious beliefs, and the effect of the government's use
of religious symbolism depends upon its context.''
   The American Civil Liberties Union and others went to court
seeking removal of both the Pittsburgh creche and the menorah.

<HEAD>State Lawmakers Foresee Legislative War on Abortion</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GARY LANGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   State lawmakers say abortion restrictions approved by the U.S.
Supreme Court will turn the nation's legislatures into war zones.
   Anti-abortion legislators across the country said they will use
Monday's ruling as a plan of attack to limit the availability of
legal abortions in their states. Proponents of legal abortion
pledged a staunch defense.
   ``There are two irreconcilable positions that are very strongly
held,'' said Rhode Island Rep. Arthur M. Read II, a Democrat. In the
new round of debates, he said: ``I would expect warfare.''
   Many lawmakers will have to hold their fire for the moment. Most
state legislatures are in summer recess, and their leaders generally
were cool to calls for special sessions to take up the abortion
issue.
   ``I think we ought to take the summer and seriously consider
this,'' said Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson. ``Illinois might set a
model for the nation by engaging in reasoned discussion and
hearings.''
   Other minds were made up. In Maine, Gov. John R. McKernan Jr.
said he would fight any effort to restrict abortion. In Michigan,
Republican state Sen. Jack Welborn said he already has drafted a law
based on the new restrictions.
   And in Louisiana, state Rep. Alphonse Jackson, a Democrat,
sounded as if the pro-choice fight already were lost.
   ``What are the poor people going to do?'' he asked. ``Poor women
will have no right to determine what is to be done with their
bodies.''
   Jackson reflected concerns that the ruling, by permitting states
to further restrict public expenditures for abortions, would
primarily hurt the poor. Others shared that view.
   ``I've never been for unfettered abortions, but laws that
restrict poor people and black people from getting abortions that
affluent people can get, I've always been opposed to,'' said New
Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
   Legislators in New Jersey, where Republican Kean is leaving
office this year, said the issue could play a prominent role in the
gubernatorial election. Lawmakers elsewhere also expected no chance
to hide.
   ``People are going to be put on the line now,'' said Connecticut
House Speaker Richard J. Balducci, a Democrat. ``They're going to
have to say, ``Hey, I'm for it,'' or `I'm against it.'''
   In its ruling, the court said states may bar any public employee
from assisting in abortions not neccessary to save the mother's
life, and may forbid use of any public hospital or facility in such
abortions.
   It also authorized a prohibition on public spending for
``encouraging or counseling'' women to have abortions that are not
needed to save their lives, and said states may require doctors to
determine, when possible, whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old can
live outside the womb.
   While the ruling left a woman's basic right to abortion intact,
``We can go ... a lot further in restricting abortions,'' said
Pennsylvania Rep. Stephen Freind, a Republican and a leading
abortion foe in his state.
   ``The right-to-life philosophy has been on the defensive since
Roe vs. Wade,'' the 1973 ruling legalizing abortion, said Montana
Sen. Tom Rasmussen, a Republican. ``This gives us greater impetus to
go on the offensive.''
   ``It's going to be the same old fight, but more intense,'' said
Kansas Sen. Ben Vidricksen, a Republican. ``In fact, it's going to
be a bloody battle in the Legislature.''
   Until legislatures act, current state laws remain in effect,
noted attorney Sarah Weddington, who successfully argued Roe vs.
Wade. ``Tomorrow it's going to be the same as today,'' she said.
``But what we are going to see is a tremendous surge of legislative
activity.''
   The outcome of that activity is unclear in many states. Montana's
Sen. Rasmussen gave new restrictions only a 50-50 chance there.
   The state attorney general in Idaho predicted tougher abortion
laws will be enacted there. Lawmakers in Wyoming made the same
prediction: ``There does appear to be a right-to-life majority in
the Legislature,'' said Republican Sen. Charles Scott. ``I suspect
there will be a move to do whatever the Supreme Court will allow.''
   In Iowa, ``I doubt that we will be passing any restrictions,''
said Democratic House Speaker Don Avenson, a candidate for governor.
``We will be very cautious about even thinking of restricting
women's reproductive rights.'' But the opposite view was expressed
by Alabama Republican Rep. Greg Beers, an abortion opponent.
   ``Not only will Alabama introduce bills that will bring Alabama
into a more conservative mode with regards to abortion,'' he said,
``I believe you'll see every state in America introducing
legislation like this.''

   Arsonists threw three Molotov cocktails at the
home of a Buddhist priest, causing about $37,000 worth of damage,
authorities said. No injuries were reported.
   Revmanssi Phongpharnich, a Buddhist priest, was inside the home
with her her husband, Pradit, and their two children when the fire
erupted early Monday, authorities said.
   Family members fought the flames on the wood-shingled roof with
garden hoses before firefighters arrived.
   The blaze destroyed the roof and damaged the attic, officials
said.
   Revmassi Phongpharnich, a priest at a Thai temple in Hacienda
Heights about 20 miles east of Los Angeles, said she didn't think
her religious practice had anything to do with the firebombing.
   ``There's no indication of any racial or religious hatred, we
still couldn't tell you the reason behind it,'' said Police Sgt.
Fred Rembold.

<HEAD>Peruvian Novelist Vargas Llosa Resumes Bid For Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MONTE HAYES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Novelist Mario Vargas Llosa has stepped back
into the race for president after putting to rest internal squabbles
within his center-right coalition.
   The acclaimed 53-year-old writer reversed himself Monday after
shocking Peru's political circles by withdrawing his candidacy June
21 and leaving for Europe.
   At the time, he criticized the ``mediocre and petty'' motives of
some members of the coalition that nominated him. He said they were
putting their own parochial interests above those of the nation.
   Peru is beset by economic chaos and a growing leftist insurgency.
   Public opinion polls show Vargas Llosa with 44 percent of voter
support, more than double the figure for his principal rival,
Alfonso Barrantes, a Marxist and former mayor of Lima.
   Speaking at a news conference broadcast from Madrid, Spain,
Vargas Llosa said Monday that the Democratic Front, the center-right
coalition that nominated him on June 4, had resolved its internal
dispute over municipal elections.
   Analysts said Vargas Llosa's handling of the issue strengthened
his leadership role within the alliance and demonstrated his
political skill and determination to be more than a figurehead for
old-line leaders.
   The two major coalition parties, the Popular Action Party of
former President Fernando Belaunde Terry and the Popular Christian
Party, had threatened to run their own candidates in November
municipal elections.
   Last week, the parties agreed to Vargas Llosa's demand that the
coalition, rather than individual parties, would put forward
candidates. He said this was necessary to keep the Democratic Front
united for next year's presidential election.
   In his letter of resignation, he said that even if the coalition
were to win the presidency, the disputes would leave the new
government too weak to confront the leftist insurgency or resolve
Peru's economic ills.
   The government's nine-year struggle against Maoist Shining Path
guerrillas has claimed more than 15,000 lives. Meanwhile, inflation
has reached an annual rate of nearly 6,000 percent.
   In his Monday news conference broadcast on Peruvian TV and radio,
Vargas Llosa said ``the differences'' that led him to resign no
longer existed.
   He said the parties ``have reached an agreement that seems very
reasonable to me and I think also to most of the public.''
   Vargas Llosa said he planned to return to Lima this week to
resume his campaign.
   The election is planned for March, but an exact date has not been
set. The winner is to take office on July 28.
   For months, opponents of Vargas Llosa have hinted that the writer
did not have the political strength for a presidential campaign. But
analysts said Monday that his firmness on municipal elections showed
he is far tougher than even his coalition allies realized.
   Vargas Llosa was catapulted into the political arena after
organizing a huge demonstration against populist President Alan
Garcia's plan to nationalize banks. He said the takeover attempt
represented a ``totalitarian'' threat to the Peruvian economy.
   He found himself transformed overnight into a new political
leader, and conservatives saw in him a man who could return them to
power.

   It began with a pair of pink flamingos.
A decade later Dick and Jane's Spot has become a work of art.
   Festooned with 1,600 bicycle reflectors, 20,000 bottle caps and a
6-foot hand that once belonged to a fortune teller, the home of
artists Dick Elliott and Jane Orleman is their largest art work.
   ``Art over the years was a very serious thing and we feel this is
a more fun point of view,'' said Jane, 47. ``We don't try to
represent the angst of the world. We try to alleviate it.''
   Located on a quiet street in this university town of 11,000
residents, Dick and Jane's Spot, which doubles as their residence,
has been surprising and delighting passersby since 1979.
   A combination roadside attraction and full-size playhouse, the
Spot is an ever-changing work, with sunlight reflecting different
colors from each reflector, and more than 100 silver bicycle wheels
whirling in the wind. The bottle caps rust and the garden changes
through the seasons.
   The couple recently received a $2,500 grant from Art Matters
Inc., a New York City foundation, to install lights in the yard, so
darkness can no longer obscure the sights.
   They bought the 100-year-old frame house for $18,000 when it was
a decrepit wreck in 1978, and shortly after received a pair of pink
flamingos from Jane's mother.
   They soon began adding things. Over the years, about 30 artists
have contributed carvings, sculpture and other pieces. The 100
separate works include carved heads, a sculpture using a huge fish
net, and a brick fountain in the shape of a heart known as the Heart
of Washington. That is a pun on Ellensburg's location in the center
of the state.
   ``It's sort of turning into a private museum for folk art,'' said
Dick, 43. ``We've become a humane society for lost art.''
   The most popular work is a statue of a man with a camera for a
face and flashcubes for eyeballs, Dick said.
   ``It's a camera-faced tourist,'' he said. ``People really like
that one.''
   There is a guest book outside the fence with a sign saying ``What
is this place?'' above it.
   That's the most frequently heard question, Dick said.
   Now included on tour bus stops, The Spot is surrounded by a
wooden fence. The major works are in the front and back yards and
can be viewed from the sidewalk.
   ``We are not open to the public,'' Dick said. ``We don't want
people coming into the yard.''
   The couple met when both were art students at Central Washington
University in Ellensburg.
   When they aren't replacing the bicycle reflectors or fixing the
rotating wheels, they operate the Spot Janitorial Co., which cleans
businesses in the area.
   They work part-time running the business, with the rest of the
time devoted to art.
   Dick makes ``paintings'' using thousands of small reflectors.
   He has a show opening at the Deson-Saunders gallery in Chicago,
another opening soon at the Richard Gasperi gallery in New Orleans,
and has had shows in the Seattle area.
   One of his paintings requiring 25,000 reflectors will be
installed at the University of Washington this fall, and they just
received a fellowship from the Bellevue Art Museum.
   ``I'm the only person I know of using reflectors as a painting
medium,'' Dick said, adding he had to search for years before
finding a factory to produce the reflectors.
   Jane also is a painter, although ``generally with actual paint.''
   She also has created several of the sculptures in the yard.
   The Orlemans, married 18 years, have no intention of selling the
house.
   ``It's home,'' Jane said.

   Missouri's anti-abortion law won't
have a dramatic impact on the availability of abortions in the
state. But both sides say the Supreme Court's decision upholding the
law has far-reaching potential.
   ``I think it will not only save the unborn child, but also save
the women who were being exploited. That's been the bottom line
goal,'' said Lou DeFeo of the Missouri Catholic Conference, who
helped write the 1986 Missouri law.
   But DeFeo acknowledged, ``If a woman really wants an abortion in
Missouri, she can get it.''
   On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld key provisions of the
Missouri law that prohibits public hospitals from performing
abortions and bans the use of tax dollars for counseling or
encouraging women about abortion. It also requires doctors to test
for the viability of a fetus after 20 weeks.
   ``The immediate impact will not be all that substantial,'' said
state Attorney General William Webster, who argued the case before
the court.
   He noted that most abortions in Missouri are performed in private
clinics, not public ones affected by the ruling.
   State health officials said that of the 17,382 abortions
performed in Missouri last year, only 90 were performed in public
hospitals.
   ``I think the real significance is not short term, but long
term,'' Webster said, predicting that states will pass a ``second
generation'' of laws that regulate abortions.
   Supporters of abortion rights called the ruling a devastating
setback that will prompt further efforts to outlaw abortions. They
said the impact on Missouri will fall hardest on poor women.
   Mary Bryant, a Planned Parenthood lobbyist who fought the law,
said she expected an ``avalanche'' of restrictive legislation
introduced in Missouri and other states.
   Bryant said the law's requirement for viability testing is cruel
because most women who have abortions after the first trimester are
poor and young. During the first few months, some don't know what is
happening to them, she said.
   But DeFeo said the Missouri law will stop second trimester
abortions for women and by doctors who had been ``hedging on the
truth and performing an abortion on a viable child as if it weren't
a viable child.''
   Gov. John Ashcroft, a staunch anti-abortionist, said he would
appoint a task force to study how the state could further restrict
abortions.
   Asked if he would appoint any pro-choice advocates, Ashcroft
said, ``It would not be appropriate to have groups that recommend
abortion on the panel.''
   Webster said two public hospitals will have to stop performing
abortions _ Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and the University
of Missouri Hospital and Clinics in Columbia.
   Dr. James Mongan, executive director of the 360-bed Truman
Medical Center, said the hospital will stop performing abortions,
which are paid for by the patient. Abortions in Missouri have not
been financed with public money since the mid-1970s.
   Officials at University of Missouri said their doctors also will
stop performing abortions.
   The executive director of Reproductive Heath Services, the
private St. Louis clinic that challenged the law, said her clinic
will continue to provide ``all choices to women, regardless of their
ability to pay.''
   ``This is a tragedy ... that will affect mostly low-income
women,'' said B.J. Isaacson-Jones. ``I am filled with grief, rage
and bitter disappointment.''
   The cost of abortions for low-income women at the private clinic
is determined on a sliding scale. The standard fee for
first-trimester abortions is $260.
   Judith Widdicombe, founder of the clinic, called the decision an
outrage.
   ``There's a movement in this country that will not tolerate this.
It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s,'' she said.
   ``Their goal is no abortions,'' Widdicombe said. ``Next will come
birth control.''

   Panama has been declared ineligible for more

behind on repayments of $163 million borrowed earlier.
   Panama's total debt is over $5 billion. Panama is one of 151
member governments in the fund.
   The ban was decided Monday by the 22 members of the Executive
Board, who meet behind closed doors. They usually act by consensus.
   In the past two years, U.S. financial sanctions against Manuel
Antonio Noriega have failed to dislodge him as Panama's leader.
Noriega has been indicted on U.S. drug trafficking charges.
   Panama is the ninth government to be banned from receiving new

   The Army has again grounded its fleet of AH-64
Apache attack helicopters, this time while it investigates the cause
of a crash in Florida last week.
   The Apache is the nation's most sophisticated helicopter gunship.
The Army now has 486 of them.
   The grounding announced Monday came in the wake of last week's
crash in northern Florida of an Apache gunship assigned to the
Florida National Guard. The co-pilot was killed and the pilot was
seriously injured when the tail rotor came off.
   The Apache fleet was last grounded in August 1987 while
investigators studied the failure of one component of the tail
rotor. The Army said Monday, however, it had already ruled out that
problem as a factor in last week's crash. The Apache fleet was
grounded twice in 1986, both times for relatively minor problems.

<UNK>Study Calls for Change in Weapon Purchases</UNK>

   The Bush administration should create a weapons
``procurement corps'' separate from the Pentagon to eliminate
conflicts of interest in purchasing weapons, a study suggests.
   The study was released Monday by Ralph Nader's Center for Study
of Responsive Law.
   The study cited varying reasons for the Pentagon's weapons
problems, including overreliance on new technologies, insufficient
testing, inadequate competition and a ``revolving door'' between the
Pentagon procurement system and private defense contractors.
   It also blamed members of Congress for judging new weapons
projects on the potential economic payoff for their own state or
district rather than the actual need for the weapons.

   Jim Backus, throaty voice of the nearsighted
``Mr. Magoo'' and breezy spirit behind the shipwrecked millionaire
of ``Gilligan's Island,'' has died at age 76.
   Backus, whose career in radio, film and television spanned more
than half a century, died Monday from pneumonia. He had suffered
from Parkinson's disease for many years.
   The actor who played the fabulously wealthy Thurston Howell III
on television's ``Gilligan's Island'' also was featured in dozens of
motion pictures.
   One of his most memorable roles was that of James Dean's
ineffectual father in ``Rebel Without a Cause.'' It took a character
actor with presence to don an apron and wheedle Dean about his
adolescent traumas.
   Backus kept his sense of humor despite his ill health in recent
years, according to Alan Hale, who played the burly Skipper of the
Minnow on ``Gilligan's Island.''
   ``He certainly still had that wonderful sense of humor,'' Hale
said. ``You could see it in his eyes.''
   Backus had been undergoing treatment for pneumonia since June 13
at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica.
   ``I used to do benefits and I'd come home with whatever symptoms
went with the disease I was benefiting,'' Backus quipped in an
interview five years ago.
   ``When they told me I had Parkinson's, I read a magazine article
on it, and overnight I had every symptom known to man. I became an
authority on it.''
   Backus' ability to find humor in almost any situation was one of
his most outstanding qualities, according to members of the cast of
the popular 1960s television series about seven stranded castaways
shipwrecked with nothing to do but dream up ridiculous rescue
schemes.
   ``He was always up,'' said Bob Denver, who played Gilligan, the
hapless mate.
   ``Everyday he must have told at least 10 to 15 jokes. ...
Whenever he'd come on the set all the crew would get happy.''
   Backus' baritone voice also was known to millions as that of the
cartoon character Mr. Quincy Magoo on the program ``Famous
Adventures of Mr. Magoo.'' On the series, Magoo played various
historical figures, including Long John Silver, Friar Tuck, William
Tell and Rip Van Winkle. Backus also did a stage production of Mr.
Magoo.
   Backus was a lot like the Magoo character, according to Hale. He
said that while shooting the pilot for ``Gilligan's Island'' in
Hawaii, Backus would often come down from his room in the morning
without his glasses.
   ``He'd say hello to everyone, but he didn't know who you were,''
Hale recalled. ``He really was Mr. Magoo. He really couldn't see
that well.''
   ``He was a unique talent,'' said Sherwood Schwartz, creator and
producer of ``Gilligan's Island.''
   ``I created that (Thurston Howell) character with him in mind
because I don't know anybody else who could play that character the
way Jim did.''
   On the series, still popular in syndication, Backus' character
was adapted from his Hubet Updyke, the world's richest man on the
Alan Young radio show of the 1940s.
   He also played Judge Bradley Stevens on ``I Married Joan,'' an
early television situation comedy with Joan Davis. He was seen on
``Playhouse 90'' and ``Studio One.''
   A native of Cleveland, Backus studied at the American Academy of
Dramatic Arts, graduating in 1933. Classmates included Hume Cronyn,
Garson Kanin and Tyrone Power.
   He appeared on Broadway in ``Paint Your Wagon'' and ``Too Many
Heroes.''
   Other Backus film credits included ``Deadline, U.S.A.,'' with
Humphrey Bogart, ``Pat and Mike,'' with Katharine Hepburn and
Spencer Tracy and ``It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World,'' with Milton
Berle and an all-star comic cast.
   Backus and his wife, Henriette, produced two humorous books,
``Backus Strikes Back'' and ``Forgive Us Our Digressions.'' He also
wrote the books ``Rocks on the Roof,'' ``What Are You Doing After
the Orgy?'' and composed the records ``Delicious'' and ``Cave Man.''
   Backus is survived by his wife. The couple were childless.
   Burial services were to be private. A public memorial service was
not immediately announced.

   The tinny song of the Good Humor man has
kids screaming for ice cream, but their parents are getting tired of
paying the piper, especially before meals.
   ``The ice-cream truck invariably comes by right before dinner,
which is when kids are hungry and tired and cranky,'' said Linda
Lowenstein, who presented a petition to the city council asking that
ice cream truck music be banned.
   ``It sets up a situation where the kids are adversaries with the
parents,'' according to environmental enforcement officer Terry
Steinborn, who said the council is considering lowering the
allowable noise from the trucks to 55 decibels, about the same as
normal conversation.
   The ordinance was suggested by frustrated parents who are tired
of battling their children at dinnertime over the merits of
chocolate chip vs. peas and carrots. Forty people complained about
the ice-cream song in 1988.
   The existing limit is 80 decibels. Ice-cream trucks with music
have been measured at 70 to 90 decibels.
   Only one company, Ice Cream Wagon Inc. of Commerce City, operates
an ice-cream truck with music in Boulder, Steinborn said.
   Company owner Joe Saurini has said operating an ice-cream truck
without music would be ``like climbing mountains without shoes.''
   Loewenstein, a columnist for the Boulder Daily Camera, said
Friday, ``I realize it's fun for the kids to go out to the ice-cream
man, take their money out and be their own little bosses. I don't
think it's evil; it's just annoying.''

   The repair-related delays that caused
hundreds of would-be passengers to cancel trips on two Orion Air
flights cast unfavorable light on an airline that has come under
fire in recent years.
   On Sunday, 167 passengers in Manchester, England, got refunds
when they refused to travel to Florida on an Orion jumbo jet delayed
for two days by three mechanical problems, said Roy Edwards, manager
of the Manchester Airport. The incident came four days after 53
British tourists refused to reboard a Hawaii-bound Orion jet after
it was forced to land in Edmonton, Alberta on a repair stop.
   An Orion employee reached at the Raleigh headquarters Monday said
Robert Bushman, president and chief executive officer, was
unavailable for comment. Other officials did not return the phone
call.
   Orion was involved in a 1988 lawsuit for training non-union
pilots in anticipation of a strike at Eastern Airlines, and the
Federal Aviation Administration fined the airline for 2,000 safety
violations.
   Eastern was then embroiled in a dispute with its machinists over
the airline's demand for a $50 million cut in annual labor costs.
   Orion, then the largest operator of jet aircraft for the small
package industry, asked the FAA for permission to become a passenger
carrier to fly some Eastern planes in the event of a strike.
   Eastern and Orion entered into a $50 million-a-year contract
calling for Orion to hire 400 flight attendants, 300 pilots and 100
mechanics to cover about 10 percent of Eastern's fleet.
   The pact came at a good time for Orion, which was then phasing
out a $32 million-a-year contract to fly and maintain planes for
United Parcel Service of America Inc. UPS, which had provided about
half of Orion's business, decided to fly and maintain its own
aircraft.
   As Orion sought FAA approval for passenger service, an FAA
inspection report said the airline had more than 2,000 safety
infractions from its cargo operation.
   The agency listed a shortage of required training records,
inadequate auditing of maintenance facilities, poor documentation on
the qualifications of ``check pilots'' who decide on the performance
of line pilots and incomplete flight operations manuals.
   Orion officials during congressional hearings said many of the
concerns stemmed from a misunderstanding about Orion's methods of
record keeping and that all of the concerns had been resolved.
   In March 1988, the Air Line Pilots Association sucessfully sued
to prevent Orion from operating flights for Eastern, saying such
subcontracting would violate the union's contract with Eastern.
   The next month, the FAA proposed $636,200 in fines against Orion
for violations uncovered during inspections of the airline. Orion
paid the penalty and officials said all the violations had been
corrected.
   Eastern announced in May 1988 that it had canceled its contract
with Orion. The cancellation cost Eastern about $5.5 million under a
provision of the Orion contract.

   The attorney who argued the case that
legalized abortions and the ``Jane Roe'' she represented said they
were crushed by the Supreme Court's abortion decision but pledged to
fight for the right to choose.
   The attorney who opposed them saw Monday's ruling upholding
Missouri regulations limiting abortion rights as a sign that Roe vs.
Wade would be overturned.
   Attorney Sarah Weddington, who represented Jane Roe, said she had
expected the high court to only ``whittle away'' at its 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized abortions.
   ``I did not expect what they did and that was to chop away at
that decision,'' said Ms. Weddington, 44.
   ``I've invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been
handed a major defeat.''
   Her former client Norma McCorvey, a Dallas cleaning woman who
took the pseudonym Jane Roe in the landmark case, said she was angry
about the high court's ruling.
   ``We will keep fighting so that no woman will ever be maimed or
killed by an unsafe, illegal abortion,'' she told reporters in Los
Angeles.
   ``This is a critical time for all pro-choice and pro-family women
and men,'' she said. ``We must link arm and arm to protect and
uphold the right to safe and legal abortion.''
   Nevertheless, McCorvey added: ``To the Supreme Court of the
United States, thank you for not reversing Roe vs. Wade.''
   Jay Floyd, who as an assistant state attorney general faced Ms.
Weddington in the Supreme Court 17 years ago, said he was pleased by
the Missouri ruling.
   ``I think ultimately they are going to overrule Roe vs. Wade or
chip away to where it has no meaning,'' said Floyd, who has been in
private practice in the central Texas town of Llano for the past 10
years.
   Floyd's old boss at the attorney general's office, Robert
Flowers, agreed.
   ``It appears this decision is sort of a prelude to putting some
further restrictions on abortion rights,'' said Flowers, who argued
the state's case before the Supreme Court in 1972 when the justices
had oral arguments repeated before issuing Roe vs. Wade.
   Ms. Weddington said the issue rests with young adults, but she
pledged to continue to speak out. She said abortion supporters must
lobby their state legislatures.
   ``If people don't really say, `No we're not going to have this,'
if they don't lobby their own state legislatures,'' abortion will
become illegal, Ms. Weddington told reporters at Texas Woman's
University, where she is an adjunct professor.
   Earlier Monday, McCorvey, 41, appeared on the Cable News Network
show ``Sonya Live in LA,'' and said she took Monday's ruling ``very
personally.''
   ``It saddens my heart very deeply to know that poor women are
once again going to be out there going to backstreet abortions and
possibly be mutilated and not have the right to choose,'' she said.
   In 1969, McCorvey, unmarried, unemployed and pregnant, asked her
family doctor for an abortion, which was illegal in Texas. Her
doctor refused, and she didn't like what she saw at an illegal
abortion clinic, spurring the lawsuit.
   By the time the Supreme Court ruled, McCorvey had given birth to
a daughter and had given the child up for adoption. In 1971, she had
another child, whom she also gave up for adoption.

   Commercial crabbing was banned over a 22-mile
stretch of the Delaware River after oil-soaked crustaceans were
pulled out of the water near where a tanker ran aground and spilled
300,000 gallons of heating oil.
   Delaware's top environmental official, Edwin ``Toby'' Clark II
imposed the ban Monday from the Pennsylvania-Delaware line to the
southern tip of Pea Patch Island off Delaware City. He said the step
was necessary to protect the Delaware Bay's $1.5 million crabbing
industry.
   Meanwhile, the Greek tanker that spilled 420,000 gallons of
heating oil off Rhode Island on June 23 arrived Monday evening at a
New York shipyard for repairs.
   Aerial inspections showed no oil leaking from the World Prodigy
as it traveled from Rhode Island to the New York Shipyard Corp., the
Coast Guard said.
   The crabbing ban covers most of the area affected by a oil spill
June 24, when the Uruguayan tanker Presidente Rivera ran aground
just below the state line near Claymont, dumping 306,684 gallons of
heating oil into the river.
   The ban was expected to last about three weeks, said Roger Lucio,
spokesman for the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental
Control.
   ``The order serves as a precautionary measure to ensure no
oil-tainted crabs are placed on the market,'' Lucio said.
   Oil-covered crabs were first pulled from the river by commercial
watermen on Saturday. The watermen were then advised to crab south
of the island. The advisory remained in effect after the ban was
imposed.
   Coast Guard Lt. James Weakley said there were no reports of
oil-covered crabs off New Jersey.
   Cleanup efforts continued along the riverbanks of Delaware,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Weakley said there were ``negligible
amounts of free-floating oil in the water.''
   The Coast Guard estimated 75 percent to 80 percent of the oil had
been cleaned up.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged down
Tuesday, while the dollar was sharply lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended trading at 140.95 yen, down 1.55 yen from
Monday's 142.50-yen close. The currency opened at 141.28 yen and
fluctuated between 140.45 yen and 141.50 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 46.04
points, or 0.14 percent, ending the day at 33,190.38. The index had
gained 287.73 points the previous day.
   Nomura Securities analyst Masahiro Umemori said Japanese
investors' buying incentive was weak due to the governing Liberal
Democratic Party's election loss and concerns over the upcoming
national election for the upper house of Parliament.
   In Sunday's election for 128 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan
Assembly, the LDP kept only 43 seats, losing 20 from last year's 63,
while the Japan Socialist Party's strength rose from 12 to 29 seats.
   Sunday's election was taken as an indicator of the upper house
election scheduled for July 23.
   ``Many participants were just sitting on the sidelines today,''
Umemori said.
   In currency dealings, Japanese investors were taking profits by
selling dollars they had bought ahead of Sunday's election in Tokyo,
expecting a poor performance from the LDP, traders said.
   But the yen is not likely to rise further because of Japan's
continuing political uncertainties, especially before the upper
house election, said a trader with major commercial bank, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   Many investors avoided major moves because the New York market
was closed for the U.S. Independence Day holiday Tuesday, he added.

   A couple of red-faced Texas truck drivers
had some tall explaining to do when they nearly allowed Chandler's
``Uncle Sam Jam'' to turn into one big Independence Day dud.
   Truckers Al Freeman and Raymond Perez of Fort Worth were heading
to Chandler with nearly a ton of fireworks when they picked up a
hitchhiker Freeman described as ``just a good-lookin' ol' girl.''
   Police say the three and their cargo made it all the way to
Arizona before things went wrong.
   When the truckers stopped to buy beer, the hitchhiker stole their
truck, fireworks and all, police say.
   ``They were in for a little night of partying, but she had other
plans,'' said police Lt. John Summers. ``The two guys were going to
get some beer and she just boogied with the truck.''
   But the ``Uncle Sam Jam'' fireworks display will go on. Police
found the truck, with its cargo intact, early Monday, Summers said.
   Freeman and Perez, who were driving for Atlas Enterprises, a
California fireworks company, said they were only 25 miles out of
Fort Worth when the picked up the hitchhiker at a truck stop.
   They said the woman was headed for California and they agreed to
take her as far as Chandler, a suburb of Phoenix.
   When they pulled into Chandler on Sunday night, Freeman said, the
truckers bought dinner and invited the woman to spend the night with
them. The party ended while Freeman and Perez were buying beer.
   ``I walked out of the liquor store, and I said. `There goes our
truck,''' Freeman said.
   The woman told the truckers her name was Kim Mayberry and that
she was trying to get to Oceanside, Calif., to visit her sister.
   Police were still looking for her late Monday, Summers said.
   Terry McIntyre, an Atlas spokesman, said police woke him up early
Monday to tell him the truck had been stolen.
   ``When I heard it was stolen I went berserk,'' McIntyre said.
``It's maybe like losing your wife, maybe even worse. There's no way
we could have gotten the product in time. There wouldn't have been a
show.''
   Perez said he felt stupid when he found out that he and Freeman
had been duped.
   Freeman said he's been driving for 12 years and the woman was far
from the first hitchhiker he has picked up. And she probably won't
be the last.
   ``I ain't never gonna change,'' he said. ``But I expect I'll get
the lecture.''

   Club-wielding riot police broke up a
demonstration by about 300 striking teachers and supporters, driving
them away from the National Palace, authorities said. Witnesses said
police beat some of the protesters.
   Guillermo Mollinedo, a National Police spokesman, said at least
18 people were arrested in Monday's protest.
   Witnesses said police beat an undetermined number of people they
arrested and pushed into police vehicles.
   About 37,000 elementary and junior high school teachers entered
the fifth week of a strike Monday to demand higher salaries and
other benefits. Their walkout has kept about 1 million students from
school.
   They scheduled another demonstration for today, and it was
expected to draw thousands of teachers from the provinces.
   A separate strike has paralyzed telegraph and postal service.
   At the National Palace on Monday night, police charged a crowd
that was chanting support for 42 teachers who went inside to try to
discuss their demands with Education Minister Ricardo Galvez Gomez,
authorities said.
   Galvez Gomez has asked the courts to declare the strike illegal
and threatened to begin firing those who refuse to return to work.
   Some junior high students blocked traffic and burned tires in the
street Monday, saying they oppose both the strike and the government
position and want only to return to school.
   Authorities have said the end of the school year may be extended
from October to December if the strike does not end soon.
   Teachers are demanding raises of $80 a month. Elementary school
teachers now earn about $225 a month and middle-level teachers $310.

<HEAD>Fifth Victim Dies; Building Called `Fire Trap' in 1982</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fifth victim has died of injuries suffered in a
fire at a 10-story office building that an investigator warned seven
years ago was a firetrap.
   Fire officials said Monday their investigation of last week's
blaze continues to point to an electrical worker who apparently
triggered an explosion while changing a fuse. The electrician died
in the blast.
   Office worker Eudora Rodgers, 48, died Monday at Piedmont
Hospital. She and three other office workers who died succumbed to
smoke inhalation during the fire. More than 30 people were injured.
   Mona Watkins, a fellow office employee, said Ms. Rodgers had
guided her to a window before collapsing.
   ``As we were getting close, I felt her hand fall away _ we
couldn't see each other, the smoke was too thick,'' Ms. Watkins said.
   Acting Fire Chief Tom Perrin said a fire inspector examined the
Peachtree 25th Building in July 1982 and concluded that a fire could
be disastrous in the structure, which was built in 1962 and had no
sprinklers.
   ``When he conducted his investigation some years back, he felt
like it was a fire trap,'' Perrin said. The investigator, now a fire
company lieutenant, suggested changes, Perrin said.
   ``Four lives could have been saved if there had been sprinklers
in there,'' Perrin said before Ms. Rodgers' died.
   The building was renovated in July 1982, but it wasn't known if
fire code changes were made, said Deputy Chief A.D. Bell. Sprinkler
systems have been required in new buildings over eight stories tall
since 1974.
   ``We're still looking at how much renovation was conducted at
that time, and that would determine what type of codes would have to
be abided by,'' Bell said.
   Perrin said the lieutenant reminded him of the 1982 inspection
some hours after the fire at the midtown office building. The
lieutenant has since left on vacation and will be questioned further
when he returns, Perrin said.
   American Management Co. of Torrance, Calif., which manages the
Peachtree 25th building, referred reporters to a representative in
its Atlanta office, who did not return a reporter's telephone call
Monday.

<HEAD>Adams Sues Producer of Film That Led to His Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Randall Dale Adams is suing the producer of the
``Thin Blue Line,'' the movie that helped win his release from
prison after 12 years and exoneration from a murder conviction.
   Producer Errol Morris said he is ``hurt and upset'' by the
lawsuit, in which Adams is seeking to gain film rights to his life
story.
   District Judge Felix Salazar on Monday postponed a hearing on the
suit because the defendants filed a motion to move the proceedings
to federal court.
   The suit contends that Morris lost his rights to Adams' life
story in December 1988, when he failed to exercise a two-year option
purchased from Adams for $10 in December 1986.
   An appeals court overturned Adams conviction after he served 12
years in prison following his conviction in the shooting death of
Dallas policeman Robert Wood. Adams was freed from prison in March
and Dallas County prosecutors declined to try him again.
   ``I worked very, very hard for a number of years to see that
justice was done in this case and to see that Randall Adams walked
out of prison,'' Morris said.
   The producer said his profits from the film, which was not widely
distributed, were ``nil.'' He said he is still paying off debts from
the movie.
   ``The simple thing is that when I met Randall Adams, nobody cared
about the case, no one wanted to investigate it, no one wanted to
write about it,'' Morris said.
   Adams, 40, is not seeking royalties, said his lawyer, Randy
Schaffer.
   He said Adams wants a declaration that he owns the right to his
own life story. That would enable him to pursue offers Schaffer
estimated ``in the neighborhood of six figures.''
   ``They think they bought (Adams) lock, stock and barrel for $10,
and that's unconscionable,'' Schaffer said. ``He is grateful, but
what is he supposed to do? He's got offers to do a book and a
movie.''
   Schaffer said Morris has claimed he did exercise the option to
purchase Adams' story and has resold the rights to Mirimax
Production Co., also a defendant.
   Adams reportedly was en route from his home in Ohio to Houston
and could not be reached for comment.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An unabridged edition of China's 16th-century
pornographic classic, ``The Golden Lotus,'' has been published after
being banned for 40 years by the Communist government.
   The official Xinhua News Agency reported today that 8,000 copies
of the bawdy tale about a philandering merchant and his six wives
were printed, but said they would be distributed only to professors
of Chinese language and ``Golden Lotus'' researchers.
   The report did not say if more printings were planned.
   The book was printed from a master copy of the work stored in the
Beijing University library, the news agency said. It said the book
contains 200 pictures, but did not describe them.
   An abridged version of the book was published two years ago, but
censors cut out more than 10,000 words on the sexual perambulations
of the merchant, Jing Xiwen. Even so, more than 10,000 copies were
immediately sold out.
   The Communist government banned the novel in 1949 because of its
explicit sexual descriptions.
   Besides being a tale of sex that far outdoes most modern erotica,
``The Golden Lotus'' is China's earliest novel describing the lives
of ordinary people in believable terms.
   It also is the first novel to focus on female characters and the
first book to be written in the vernacular.

<HEAD>A Potentially Dangerous Phone Book Error</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Telecom Australia said today that it
had accidentally included dozens of unlisted numbers in the 1989
Melbourne Phone Book. It said the error could endanger some
subscribers.
   An unknown number of such numbers and the addresses of those
subscribers were included in the directory, Telecom White Pages
manager Kevin Brennan said.
   He expressed concern for people who, following marriage breakups
and domestic troubles, did not want their numbers and addresses
published.
   Telecom will consider offering certain individuals security
protection if their cases warrant it, he said.
   ``We knew there was a problem in April, but printing had already
begun and we had no way of identifying those affected,'' Brennan
said. ``The mistake occured when information was transferred from an
old data base.
   ``The publication of the phone numbers can be easily rectified by
simply giving subscribers a new number, but unfortunately the
release of addresses is a problem.''
   Victorian state Police Association spokesman Brian Harding said
the matter was of great concern to his members:
   ``We take violent exception to it and will be complaining
vociferously ... People performing public duties and in particular
the police, are vulnerable to people with vindictive dispositions.''

<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three days after sweeping out a civilian
government, strongman Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed el-Bashir was
quoted as saying he has invited the leader of southern rebels to the
capital for peace talks.
   The Saudi Arabian daily Okaz also quoted el-Bashir on Monday as
saying he intends to fight fighting corruption and that he has
ordered all citizens to exchange their foreign currency within a
week or face trial by military court.
   El-Bashir has said he would welcome negotiations with any enemy
who would lay down arms, but his quoted remarks Monday were the
first mention of inviting rebel leader John Garang to talks in the
Sudanese capital.
   ``The aim of inviting Garang to Khartoum is an initiative meant
to demonstrate good intent and if anyone carrying arms, not just
Garang, wishes to cooperate .... We are prepared,'' el-Bashir was
quoted as sayng.
   Garang's Sudan People's Liberation Army launched its rebellion
six years ago, demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms in
three southern provinces.
   Egypt's Middle East News Agency, reporting from Khartoum, said
Monday that a 6 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew was imposed in Wad Medani,
about 110 miles southeast of Khartoum. It gave no reason.
   Also Monday, Khartoum airport was fully reopened after being
closed to most flights since Friday.
   Asked by Okaz if former President Gaafar Nimieri may return,
el-Bashir termed the question ``premature,'' the newspaper reported.
   A military coup ousted Nimeiri in April 1985.
   El-Bashir has said his coup was not connected to Nimeiri, who
late Sunday declared support for the new regime from exile in Egypt.
Nimeiri is an archenemy of the man el-Bashir deposed _ Prime
Minister Sadek el-Mahdi.
   Sudan's new leader led 14 middle-level officers in overthrowing
Mahdi's civilian government on Friday.
   The new leadership said Monday that banks will start accepting
foreign currency at market rates and all citizens must hand in
``every bit of hard currency'' they possess.
   The statement, carried by Sudan News Agency, said a one-week
grace period started Monday. After that, the army will on the
lookout for foreign currency dealers, who will be given the death
sentence, the agency said.
   The value of the dollar fell sharply after the coup began,
dropping from 21 Sudanese pounds per dollar to 12 pounds.
   ``The new regime will give priority to two basic issues, security
and economy,'' the Saudi daily quoted el-Bashir as saying.
   ``The first step we shall take ... will be to combat corruption
in all its forms ... and then rehabilitate the economic structure of
the country, the factories.''
   El-Bashir told officers Monday that Arab states have supported
his revolution. He said Saudi Arabia and Egypt had promised to
supply wheat, flour and oil. Egypt recognized the military
government on Saturday.
   El-Bashir has said he wants good relations with all Arab lands
and balanced relations with the superpowers and the rest of the
world.

   Flash floods swept through 50 villages
and drowned at least two people after heavy rains forced tributaries
of the Brahmaputra River over their banks, officials said today.
   The floods began Monday in the northern and eastern regions of
the country after monsoon rains swelled the rivers, Relief Ministry
officials said. They said at least 50 villages were flooded, and
rice crops were damaged.
   At least two people were washed away by rising water in the
Bandarban district 150 miles southeast of Dhaka, police in the area
said.
   Sangbad, a Dhaka-based newspaper, said at least 20,000 people
were marooned by the floods in the northern district of Rangpur. It
said they took refuge on high ground or roofs.
   Bangladesh, a low-lying country of 110 million people, is
criss-crossed by hundreds of rivers that form the deltas of the
Brahmaputra and the Ganges rivers. The summer monsoons usually cause
flooding.
   Last year, floods inundated about four-fifths of Bangladesh, and
at least 1,400 people were killed. At least 2.3 million people were
left homeless.

   Suspected communist rebels today
killed the police chief of the Philippines' major financial center
in an escalation of street violence sweeping the capital area,
police said.
   Col. Herminio Taylo, 54, police chief of Makati, had just
finished jogging and was buying fruit in a public market when two
assassins opened fire with .45-caliber pistols, police said. He died
an hour later in a hospital.
   Police Sgt. Lydio Zeta quoted witnesses as saying the gunmen
shouted ``We are NPAs,'' referring to the rebel New People's Army,
and warned bystanders not to interfere. They fled in a commandeered
passenger jeep after taking Taylo's pistol, Zeta said.
   Makati, a twin city of Manila with a population of about 440,000,
is the country's major banking and financial center and is also the
home of numerous foreign embassies.
   Taylo was the 10th soldier or policeman slain in the Manila area
in the last two weeks. The military says communist rebels have
killed up to 65 soldiers and police in the capital region since
January.
   The New People's Army also claimed responsibility for the April
21 assassination of U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe, who was
slain on his way to work at the Joint U.S. Military Assistance Group
headquarters in suburban Quezon City.
   Taylo was slain one day after Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre,
Capital Region commander, announced formation of a special task
force to track down rebel assassins in the capital.
   President Corazon Aquino deplored the latest killing but said
public officials must learn to live with the threat of
assassination. She said the government had provided bodyguards to
Cabinet members who have requested them or who have received death
threats.
   ``It is really very unfortunate and I do sympathize with the
family of Col. Taylo,'' said Mrs. Aquino, whose husband Benigno was
slain in a political assassination in 1983. ``And I hope that this,
perhaps, could be a reminder to all our people in the military and
police that they should take necessary precautions to ward off these
assasination attempts.''
   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said the killing of Taylo
showed that every soldier and policeman was a potential target of
assassination.
   ``This is war and somebody is bound to get hurt in the process,''
Ileto said. ``I'm sure all the major unit commanders are doing their
best not only to protect their men but to counter such acts.''
   Despite the escalating violence, Mrs. Aquino said she still plans
to go ahead with a visit to Western Europe this month.
   Mrs. Aquino leaves Saturday for an official visit to West
Germany. She will also visit France and Belgium before departing
Brussels for home on July 15.

   A fiery explosion in a chemical mixing vat
killed three workers and injured two, authorities said.
   A team from the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Agency was
expected to arrive today to investigate, said Hugh Hillhouse, site
manager of the chemical division of the Minnesota Mining and
Manufacturing Co. plant.
   The vat that exploded Monday was used in the manufacture of two
different chemicals _ Fluorel and Kel-F _ that are part of the
production of high-temperature gaskets, said Hillhouse.
   The fatal accident was the 3M plant's first in its 27 years at
the Decatur site, he said.
   Hillhouse said damage could reach more than $100,000. The section
where the explosion occurred was expected to be closed for weeks.
The rest of the plant, which employs more than 1,000 people, was
expected to be open today.
   Hillhouse and officials from the Morgan County Emergency
Management Agency said no hazardous chemicals were believed to have
escaped into the atmosphere due to the fire, which took about 45
minutes to control.
   Killed were John T. Crawford, 46, of Somerville; Jerry Lloyd
Wilkerson, 49, of Trinity; and James Michael Martin, 36, of Athens.
   Martin was a 12-year production employee; Wilkerson and Crawford,
both maintenance workers, each had at least 25 years with the
company.
   The two injured were taken to Parkway Medical Center, where one
was treated and released and the other was admitted for a head
injury. His condition was not released.

   The dollar continued its fall against the Japanese
yen today, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main index edged down.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost 46.04
points, or 0.14 percent, closing at 33,190.38.
   Yoshio Shimoyama, a dealer at Nikko Securities, said Japanese
investors were reluctant to buy shares amid political uncertainties
over the July 23 election for the upper house of Parliament.
   ``Although the Nikkei fell, certain issues were bought as the
yen's appreciation reassured investors,'' he said. ``Trading was
also more active than yesterday.''
   First section volume was estimated at 550 million shares, up from
Monday's 300 million. Electrical issues attracted buyers.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 140.95 yen, down 1.55
yen from Monday's 142.50-yen close. It opened at 141.28 yen and
fluctuated between 140.45 yen and 141.50 yen. The dollar now has
fallen 3.00 yen in two trading days.
   The dollar was being sold on a number of markets, partly due to
expectations that the United States might ease its monetary policy,
said Yoshitsugu Hanada, a trader with Mitsui Bank in Tokyo.
   ``But the dollar-selling drive was weaker today than the one that
forced the currency rate to fall from 151.30 yen a couple of weeks
ago,'' he said.
   The dollar closed at 151.30 yen on June 15, but fell 6.25 yen the
next day.
   Hanada said dollar-selling for profit-taking and reported
intervention by the Bank of Japan also helped push the dollar down
today, although investors were avoiding major moves while the New
York market was closed for the Independence Day holiday.
   The central bank does not comment on its foreign exchange market
activities.
   ``Japanese investors sold the dollar to reduce their
dollar-holding positions because they had bought too much before the
Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election,'' Hanada said.
   Investors had been buying dollars out of pessimism over the
governing Liberal Democratic Party's prospects in Sunday's voting,
he said.
   In the election for 128 seats in the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly,
the LDP kept only 43 seats, a loss of 20, while the Japan Socialist
Party's strength rose from 12 to 29 seats.
   The election was taken as an indicator of how voting would go in
the July upper house election.

   Mel Blanc, the voice behind such cartoon
characters as Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, Sylvester the cat, Barney
Rubble and Dino the Dinosaur, was listed in serious condition today,
hospital officials said.
   Blanc, 81, entered Cedars Sinai Medical Center on May 19 and was
being treated for heart and other problems, hospital spokesman Ron
Wise said.
   His condition remained serious for the past week.
   ``He is being very carefully watched,'' Wise said.
   Since 1937, Blanc provided the voices for many Warner Bros.
cartoon characters, including Daffy Duck, Tweety-Pie and Yosemite
Sam.
   He is perhaps best known for Bugs Bunny's wisecracking ``What's
up Doc?'' Sylvester's ``Thufferin' thuccotash!,'' and Porky Pig's
stuttering ``Th-th-th-that's all folks.''
   He also created Woody Woodpecker's staccato laugh, the Road
Runner's nonchalant ``beep-beep,'' and Fred Flintstone's pet
dinosaur Dino's bark and Barney Rubble's voice.
   He was a regular on ``The Jack Benny Show,'' playing Professor
LeBlanc, Benny's violin teacher and the train dispatcher who
announced the stops of ``Ana-heim, A-zusa and KOOK-amunga!''
   Blanc also was Sy the Mexican gardener and made the sputtering
sounds of Benny's ancient Maxwell automobile.
   In later years, he brought his dozens of voices to numerous
commercials and gave life to many Saturday morning cartoon
characters.

   A bomb exploded in a bus today in a
crowded market section of this city near the Afghan border, killing
seven people and injuring 24, police officials said.
   The majority of the victims were Afghan nationals, said police.
   The bomb, apparently placed in the rear of the bus, exploded
shortly before noon in the crowded Khyber Bazaar. Witnesses said
windows in nearby shops shattered.
   No one claimed responsibility. Police said they had not made any
arrests and refused to speculate on suspects.
   Hundreds of explosions have ripped through Peshawar over the past
several years, killing scores of people and injuring hundreds.
   The government has blamed the bombings on Afghan government
agents.
   More than 3 million Afghan war refugees live in Pakistan, which
also headquarters U.S.-backed Afghan guerrillas, who have been
fighting for more than a decade to oust Kabul's ruling communists.
   Peshawar, at the foot of the famed Khyber Pass, is only about 40
miles east of the Afghan border. It is encircled by sprawling dust
bowls of adobe huts that house the majority of Afghan refugees
living in Pakistan.

   The Supreme Court ruling on abortion sparked angry confrontations
between pro-choice and anti-abortion forces across the country and
one rights activist predicted the issue would become ``our Vietnam
of the 1990s.''
   Some opponents of Monday's decision burned American flags in
protest, a right confirmed by the high court in a ruling last week.
   An angry, after-work crowd swelled a pro-choice rally of more
than 2,000 outside San Francisco's Federal Building. After a
candlelight vigil, about 200 protesters broke off from the larger
group and marched down Van Ness Avenue to the Mission District,
knocking over garbage cans and newspapers stands.
   Outside the historic Mission Dolores they were surrounded by
about 50 riot police. One arrest was reported.
   Lindsay Comy of San Francisco's Women's Choice Clinic offered to
teach women to perform safe abortions if the operation is outlawed
in California.
   ``We will not allow technology to be denied us,'' she said.
   In St. Louis, Judith Widdecombe, founder of the clinic involved
in the 5-4 court decision, said the ruling would not be tolerated by
women.
   ``It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s,'' she said.
   Flags were burned at protests in Chicago and other cities.
   ``I'm doing this because I want to show how angry I am,'' said
Ela Thier, as she held a match above a lighter fluid-soaked flag in
Rochester, N.Y. ``I believe that the Supreme Court has violated my
basic human rights.''
   ``It is amazing to me that we can burn the flag but yet we don't
have control over our bodies,'' said Elyce Helford, who took part in
a flag-burning at a rally of 300 pro-choice advocates in Iowa City,
Iowa.
   Monday's ruling upheld key provisions of the Missouri law that
prohibits public hospitals from performing abortions and bans the
use of tax dollars for counseling or encouraging women about
abortion. It also requires doctors to test for the viability of a
fetus after 20 weeks.
   Attorney Sarah Weddington, who represented Jane Roe in the 1973
decision that legalized abortions, saw the ruling as a sign that Roe
vs. Wade would be overturned.
   ``I've invested 20 years of my life in this and now have been
handed a major defeat,'' she said.
   About 40 anti-abortion demonstrators prayed and picketed outside
a women's clinic in Philadelphia as they claimed victory in the
Supreme Court ruling. A lone abortion-rights advocate, Kathryn
Grumman, faced the protesters with an American flag, a coat hanger
and a cross on a neckchain.
   The Northeast Women's Center, which performs abortions and other
women's health services, has been a frequent target of protests,
including one Saturday that resulted in 103 arrests.There were no
arrests Monday.
   Police arrested 25 pro-choice demonstrators for blocking traffic
at a rally by about 200 people outside the federal courthouse in New
York City, where about 100,000 abortions are performed each year.
   Many protesters wore red clothing or tied red crepe paper around
one arm. Some carried coat hangers.
   In Atlanta, pro-choice demonstrators heckled Michael Hirsh, local
director of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue, as he held a
news conference in front of the Feminist Womens Health Center in
Atlanta.
   Hirsh praised the decision and predicted that more churches in
Atlanta would join the anti-abortion movement, even surpassing
church involvement in the civil rights movement of the 1960s.
   About 50 pro-choice advocates demonstrated at the Capitol in
Austin, Texas, and pro-choice organizations planned a rally today at
the Federal Building in Utah.

   With encouragement from Secretary of State James A.
Baker III, Japan and Western Europe today pledged increases in aid
to the Philippines totaling about $335 million as part of an
ambitious international effort to bolster the country's
three-year-old democracy.
   Japanese Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzaka promised an increase
of about $101 million in aid over the $899 million it committed in
the past year.
   French Ambassador Bernard Dorin, speaking for the 12-nation
European Economic Community, said the EEC would chip in the
equivalent of $350 million, up from $117 million.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Mangaplus of the Philippines praised the
donors for their ``solemn act of humanitarian justice'' and said all
loans would be paid back.
   Earlier, Baker spoke to the conference, convened by the World
Bank, shortly after arriving from Washington. Delegations from 19
countries and seven international groups have assembled to discuss
the program, known as the Multilateral Assistance Initiative.
   It envisions a five-year program involving $10 billion in aid and
private investment for the Philippines.
   Baker said the initiative is critical to the future of
Philippines democracy. The Bush administration is asking for $200
million from Congress as its first year contribution.
   Combined with other aid requests, the administration hopes to
provide the Philippines with $658 million in economic assistance in
fiscal 1990.
   The convening of the meeting symbolizes a significant expansion
in the sharing of responsibility for the Philippines' well-being.
   Previously, the United States accounted for the bulk of foreign
aid to the its former colony, but Japan is now the largest donor.
   Baker said that despite significant economic growth in recent
years in the Philippines, ``enormous problems of poverty and
development persist _ problems that challenge us all to this very
special effort.''
   Average incomes are still well below their 1981 levels, he said.
The political upheavals of the mid-1980s, which drove out the
government of Ferdinand Marcos, devastated the Filipino economy.
   In addition, the government of President Corazon Aquino is
battling a 20-year-old communist insurgency.
   The theory behind the new initiative is that the Philippines will
be able to achieve its economic potential only through a coordinated
effort in which outside capital, economic reform and an improved
private investment climate all have key roles.
   Baker arrived in Tokyo at a time of renewed political crisis in
Japan, brought on by electoral setbacks suffered by the governing
Liberal Democrats and allegations that Prime Minister Sosuke Uno has
kept several paid mistresses.
   En route here, Baker declined comment on Uno's problems, saying
the United States must ``studiously avoid'' involvement in Japan's
internal political affairs.
   Baker and Uno were to have dinner tonight.
   After a day-long stay in Tokyo, Baker heads for Brunei, where he
is to meet with colleagues from the six-nation Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
   The talks are to focus on ways to promote an accord among rival
factions in Cambodia once the Vietnamese complete the scheduled
withdrawal of their forces in September.

<TEXT>
   The dollar slid in early European trading today and
foreign currency dealers said some market participants were trying
to push it through key levels. Gold prices strengthened.
   Trading was quiet because of the Fourth of July holiday in the
United States.
   Dealers in West Germany said dollar sellers were running into
lots of buyers as the U.S. currency approaches 1.9150 marks.
   ``That level looks really good on the chart,'' said a trader at a
major U.S. bank in Frankfurt. ``It doesn't look like we're going to
break through it today.''
   Others said the dollar's slide was also due to rumors the Bank of
Japan intervened in earlier East Asian trading and to anticipation
of lower U.S. interest rates.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.55 yen to a closing 140.95 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 141.38 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.9196 West German marks, down from 1.9285
   _1.6485 Swiss francs, down from 1.65375
   _6.5235 French francs, down from 6.5485
   _2.1633 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1775
   _1,389.50 Italian lire, up@down from 1,400.50
   _1.1920 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19455
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5880 to buy one pound, compared with $1.5775 late Monday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $378.15 a troy ounce,
compared with late Monday's $375.05. At midmorning, the city's five
major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $377.50.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $377.00, up from $374.35 late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.38 to close at a bid $378.31.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.27 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.20.

   The official writers' union has voted to reinstate
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the dissident chronicler of Stalinist terror
who was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974, a newspaper said
today.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta, the weekly newspaper of the Union of Soviet
Writers, said that the group's 26-member secretariat voted to revoke
what it called his ``wrongful'' 1969 expulsion.
   The paper said his ouster contradicted ``the principles of
socialist democracy.'' The writers' union also urged the government
to restore his citizenship, Literaturnaya Gazeta said.
   The 168-word article, which appeared midway down the front page,
did not say when the union took its action.
   The restoration follows the report in April that the leading
Soviet literary journal, Novy Mir, will publish excerpts of
Solzhenitsyn's major work, ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' by year's end.
   The work chronicles life in Soviet labor camps, mostly under
dictator Josef Stalin. Solzhenitzyn was freed from the camps after
Stalin's death in 1953.
   The works of Solzhenitsyn, who won the Nobel Prize for Literature
in 1970, have not been published in his homeland since Novy Mir
carried his short novel ``One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich''
in November 1962 during a cultural thaw under Nikita S. Khrushchev.
   The thaw ended shortly thereafter, and Solzhenitsyn's works were
banned.
   Although Soviet literary officials have authorized publication of
part of ``Gulag,'' it is not clear whether they will clear portions
of the book blaming the founder of Soviet state, Vladimir Lenin, for
initiating terror in the Soviet Union.
   Solzhenitsyn lives with his family in seclusion in Cavendish, Vt.

   Thunderstorms doused North Dakota and Nebraska today and
floodwaters were waist-high at one South Carolina crossroads.
   Rain continued in central Louisiana, where rivers were submerging
their banks and authorities expected flooding for at least two weeks.
   Thunderstorms dumped golf ball-size hail at Custer, S.D., and
Fremont County, Colo., Monday night and heavy storms swept from
Nebraska to Wisconsin.
   A tornado was spotted east of Huron, S.D., and hail the size of
gum drops fell in Kimball.
   Thunderstorms over eastern Wisconsin deluged Fond du Lac with
half an inch of rain in just ten minutes, with wind gusts of up to
46 mph.
   Widely scattered showers and thunderstorms extended this morning
along much of the Gulf and Mid Atlantic coasts and into the Ohio
Valley.
   A storm in central Alabama flooded the streets of Aliceville and
left water waist deep at Tokeena Crossroads in western South
Carolina.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the six hour period ending at 2 a.m.
EDT included nearly two inches at Crossville, Tenn., 1.83 inches at
Columbus, Ga., and 0.35 inches at Cincinnati.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 a.m. EDT ranged from 46
degrees at Sexton Summit, Ore., to 93 degrees at Phoenix.
   The Independence Day forecast called for showers and
thunderstorms scattered from eastern Texas across the Gulf Coast,
Tennessee and Ohio valleys east to the Atlantic Coast. Rain showers
were likely over western Washington state. Sunny skies were expected
for most of the rest of the nation.
   The mercury was to rise above 100 in the Rio Grande Valley; above
110 over the desert Southwest. Highs in the 90s were forecast over
southern Georgia and Florida, in the Mississippi Valley across the
Plains and the Rockies into interior California; in the 60s and 70s
from northern Idaho into Washington and along the Pacific Coast; in
the 80s elsewhere.

   A parade just for kids in Georgia, a shower of pingpong balls in
Oklahoma and a marathon 24-hour poetry reading in Florida rounded
out July Fourth plans for picnics and fireworks across the nation
today.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruling that protects flag burning as an
expression of free speech sparked plans for protests, as well as a
flag burning at the state capitol in Little Rock, Ark.
   And a U.S. citizen who lived most of his life in the Soviet Union
was due to arrive back in his hometown of Chicago today for his
first visit since 1931.
   Today's forecast was for sunny skies for much of the nation, but
showers and thunderstorms could cloud the picture for the eastern
third of the nation as well as the Gulf Coast states.
   In Elk City, Okla., the showers were to be in the form of
pingpong balls. Kathy McFall, a secretary at the Chamber of
Commerce, said the 2,000 balls dropped on the crowd will be good for
discounts at local stores.
   The nation's capital expected as many as a half-million people
for a full day of activities. Stars scheduled for Fourth of July
performances included James Galway, Henry Mancini, Pearl Bailey and
Peter Nero.
   The day's events were to begin with a parade along Constitution
Avenue.
   A more modest parade was planned in LaGrange, Ga., the fifth
annual march organized by Annette Boyd, who is known locally as the
``Parade Lady'' or ``Mrs. Red, White and Blue.'' Her parade is open
only to people 19 or younger.
   Last year more than 1,000 young people participated.
   ``It's all my 4-year-old Andrew talks about for weeks before the
Fourth,'' said Joe Barkley, a parade volunteer.
   Another American who planned to pitch was Dick D'Angelo of
Boynton Beach, Fla. He was going to plant 26-inch American flags _
200 of them _ on his neighbors' lawns.
   ``It's the birth of our nation,'' D'Angelo said. ``I just hope
they enjoy the flag and enjoy the Fourth of July.''
   The Supreme Court's flag-burning ruling prompted plans for a
special flag ceremony in El Reno, Okla., to protest the decision. A
flag that flew over the nation's Capitol was to be raised by the
Tinker Air Force Base Color Guard.
   A man planned to burn a flag today in Little Rock, Ark., and a
judge Monday refused to issue an order stopping him. Chancellor Lee
Munson, who expressed personal displeasure with Robert McIntosh's
plan, concluded that he had no legal basis for stopping it. A
private citizen had sought to stop McIntosh.
   The wife of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, Danuta, was in
Philadelphia to accept the city's first Liberty Medal and its
$100,000 cash award on behalf of her husband.
   In Chicago, Abe Stolar was due to return to his hometown for the
first time since he moved to the Soviet Union with his Russian-born
parents 58 years ago.
   After a 14-year fight to emigrate, Stolar, 77, left the Soviet
Union for Israel in March with his wife, son, daughter-in-law and
two grandchildren.
   The West Florida Literary Federation planned a marathon 24-hour
poetry reading.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, beset at home by ethnic strife
and economic woes, today began an official visit to France that one
top aide hinted could be the occasion for another dramatic Kremlin
disarmament proposal.
   ``You know that Mr. Gorbachev never comes empty-handed,'' Vadim
Zagladin, a member of the Soviet Communist Party's policy-making
Central Committee, told reporters on the eve of the Soviet
president's arrival in Paris.
   The 58-year-old Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, left their special
Ilyushin-62 jetliner at Paris' Orly Airport with broad smiles on
their faces. They were greeted by Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle.
   ``Everyone in France is interested in you personally and in your
actions,'' Mitterrand told Gorbachev and his wife, who was dressed
in a stylish green suit and black blouse.
   Both leaders said they would seek to deepen French-Soviet
relations during Gorbachev's stay. ``The Soviet people highly value
our ties of friendship and cooperation,'' Gorbachev told Mitterrand.
   The Mitterrands were to play host to the Gorbachevs at an
official luncheon held at the Elysee, the French presidential
palace, and then the two heads of state were to begin about 15 hours
of talks.
   During his three-day visit, his second to France as Soviet
leader, Gorbachev is also to meet with Premier Michel Rocard and the
secretary general of the French Communist Party, Georges Marchais.
   He will also preside over the signing of 21 bilateral accords on
topics ranging from cooperation in space to creation of a
Soviet-based joint venture to build high-definition television sets.
   Both Gorbachevs also planned to greet Parisians at the Place de
la Bastille, a square in eastern Paris where 200 years ago this
month, a mob stormed a royal prison, liberated the inmates and
massacred the warden.
   That assault, on July 14, 1789, is celebrated as the debut of the
French revolution. Marxist-Leninist doctrine considers the French
revolution as an event in the history of world class struggle on a
par with the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution that brought the Communists
to power in Russia.
   Gorbachev has often used his foreign trips to announce unilateral
Soviet disarmament measures or Kremlin arms reduction proposals.
   On his first visit to France, in October 1985, he called for both
superpowers to slash their nuclear arsenals by 50 percent, an idea
currently being negotiated by Americans and Soviets in Geneva.
   At the time, Gorbachev invited France and Britain to begin direct
discussions with the Soviets on their nuclear forces.
   Mitterrand refused, and the French have since said the United
States and Soviet Union must cut their far larger nuclear arsenals
before the French contemplate reductions in their nuclear force.
   Gorbachev, who has proposed a negotiated end to all nuclear arms
by the year 2000, is now ready to heed that reasoning, but he still
seeks France's commitment to eventual nuclear weapons cuts, Soviet
official Andrei Grachev said Monday.
   Grachev, deputy chief of the Soviet Communist Party Central
Committee's International Department, told the French radio network
France-Inter in an interview:
   ``Mr. Gorbachev can accept the French argument according to which
France awaits serious reductions (by the superpowers) to begin its
involvement in the disarmament process, while expecting France to
finally join us.''
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement said pointedly Monday
that ``the overarmed powers must first disarm, and then ... we can
talk.''
   Neither the French nor the Soviets expect the popular fervor for
the Soviet leader in France that he encountered on his last trip to
a Western country, West Germany, on June 12-15.
   French Moscow-watcher Michel Tatu wrote in the daily Le Monde
that the French, for one thing, are much more pessimistic about the
chances for success of Gorbachev's ambitious reform campaign.
   Gorbachev flew to France with Soviet food supplies at their most
meager in recent memory and with discontent rising over the lack of
visible results from his drive for perestroika, or economic and
social restructuring.
   Explosions of ethnic strife also have occurred, most recently in
the Central Asian republics of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.
   On Saturday, Gorbachev made a nationally televised appeal for
calm.
   He is to travel to Strasbourg in northeastern France on Thursday,
the final day of his visit, to address the Council of Europe, an
assembly of 23 Western European democracies founded to promote
European cooperation.
   Gorbachev is then to fly to Bucharest, Romania, for the annual
summit of the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet-led military alliance in
Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Former Hungarian Leader in Critical Condition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Hungarian leader Janos Kadar was
in critical condition after he was hospitalized with pneumonia as
well as breathing and circulatory problems, a radio report said
today.
   Communist party chairman Rezso Nyers and general secretary Karoly
Grosz visited him in the hospital today, Radio Kossuth reported.
   The brief report said Kadar's condition had turned critical but
gave no details. Party spokesman Emil Kimmel said a medical report
would be issued later today.
   Kadar, 77, was stripped of all his party posts in May after he
was reported gravely ill.
   He was named honorary chairman of the ruling Hungarian Socialist
Workers' Party in May 1988 after Grosz replaced him as party leader.
Kadar held that post for 32 years.
   Since losing the party leadership, Kadar has seen his political
legacy increasingly questioned.
   After guiding Hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance by the
1970s, he was seen as an obstacle to political and economic reform
in the 1980s.
   He has not been seen in public since April, when participants at
a communist Central Committee meeting said he gave a long, rambling
speech.
   In recent interviews, Kadar was quoted as saying the fate of Imre
Nagy and other leaders of the 1956 Hungarian revolt was his
``personal tragedy.''
   Kadar came to power after Soviet troops and tanks crushed the
uprising, and Nagy and his associates were executed on charges of
high treason in 1958 after a Stalinist show trial.
   Nagy and other uprising leaders were honored as national martyrs
at a reburial ceremony June 16 after what amounted to a political
rehabilitation of Nagy and a re-evaluation of the uprising.

   The man accused of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme refused to answer further questions in court
today, charging that prosecutors were unfairly trying to convict him.
   ``It does not matter what questions you ask, so I will not answer
your questions,'' said Christer Pettersson, a 42-year-old Swede.
   Pettersson has denied killing Palme, a four-term prime minister
who was assassinated on Feb. 28, 1986.
   Looking pale and tired, Pettersson interrupted when prosecutor
Anders Helin was about to start questioning him for a second time.
Pettersson testified on the opening day of the trial in Stockholm
District Court on June 5.
   ``You have done everything to cast doubt on witnesses supporting
my case. Imagine if you had carried out such careful investigations
with the other witnesses,'' Pettersson said.
   He was apparently referring to tough cross-examination Monday of
a defense witness who supported his alibi that he was in a train
station 18 miles away at the time of the shooting.
   The court cannot force a defendant to testify.
   Palme's widow, Lisbeth, has identified Pettersson as the man she
saw rush away after her husband was shot while the couple walked
home from a downtown movie.
   Earlier today, defense attorney Arne Liljeros tried to discredit
Mrs. Palme's testimony by questioning Stig Engstrom, one of the
first bystanders to rush up to the dying Palme.
   Engstrom, an insurance company employee, said Mrs. Palme appeared
``confused and disoriented ... but I was able to talk to her.''
   The prosecutors also showed a five-minute videotape of police
surveillance of Pettersson before his arrest in December. It showed
him walking with a limp, matching Mrs. Palme's initial account of
the man she saw escaping.
   Mrs. Palme has said she never saw Pettersson holding a gun.
   The prosecutors have built their case around her identification
and other witnesses who said they saw Pettersson nearby. The murder
weapon has not been found, and no clear motive has been established.
   Pettersson has a history of violent crime and drug abuse.
   Final arguments were scheduled to start Thursday.

<TEXT>
   The United Church of Christ wraps up its
17th General Synod today having elected a new president and chosen a
new home.
   The 1.8 million-member church voted to move its headquarters to
Cleveland from New York City to get closer to its membership base.
It also elected the Rev. Paul H. Sherry of Chicago over the Rev.
Yvonne Delk of Union City, N.J.
   Sherry said his goal is to maintain the denomination's
theological integrity.
   ``We are a church. We are not a political party or social service
organization,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, the 700-plus delegates were to end the six-day synod
today with votes on measures including a statement criticizing
treatment of the poor in the United States.
   On Monday, the UCC, considered one of the most liberal of the
mainline denominations, resolved by acclamation to deplore Monday's
U.S. Supreme Court ruling that restricted the right to an abortion.
   ``Historically, the United Church of Christ has stood for women's
rights, particularly freedom of choice in abortion,'' said Rev.
Avery Post, the retiring president.
   The vote to move caused a rift between those who wanted to get
closer to the UCC's membership base and those who feared diminishing
the 32-year-old denomination's role in the ecumenical community,
largely based in New York.
   Delegates voted 448-294 for the move, which supporters said would
free more of its money for missions by saving millions of dollars in
rent and other costs.
   Presbyterian and Lutheran denominations also have left New York
City in the past two years.
   Delk, if elected, would have become the first woman and first
black to lead a major U.S. denomination. The election was the first
contest for a UCC executive post in 20 years. The vote tally was not
disclosed.
   The UCC president has no doctrinal power over the denomination's
members, but the position is widely viewed as an important
theological platform.
   The denomination was formed in the 1957 merger of the
Congregational Christian Churches and the Evangelical and Reformed
Church in Cleveland.

   Fire destroyed a home early today, killing
six children who apparently had been left alone, officials said.
   The two-story home was engulfed in flames when firefighters
arrived just after 3:30 a.m., said Fire Capt. Mike Brown.
   Brown said the victims _ two 9-year-olds, three 10-year-olds and
a 14-year-old _ were apparently related by four families.
   ``Four of the children were found in three separate bedrooms and
the other two were in the kitchen,'' he said. ``It's hard to say if
they tried to get out.''
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Brown said there was no evidence of smoke detectors.
   ``But there should have been at least two on the property,'' he
said. `We provided a smoke detector at that residence in 1985 as
part of our Operation Firesafe program and also checked an existing
detector.''

<HEAD>Moslems Lift Land Siege; Syrians and Christians Duel</HEAD>

   Druse militiamen lifted a 16-week land
siege of Lebanon's Christian-held region today after Syrian gunners
and Lebanese Christian forces traded rocket and artillery fire that
killed one person.
   Syrian troops fired a barrage of howitzers early today in
maintaining its sea blockade of the Christian enclave. A local
newspaper reported Syria is tightening that blockade.
   Lifting the land siege appears to be a guarded response to an
Iraqi offer Sunday to halt arms shipments to the Christians if Syria
stops besieging them. Iraq, Syria's main Arab rival, is the main
backer of Gen. Michel Aoun, who leads the Christian Cabinet.
   Beirut International Airport, which Moslem leaders said would
reopen at noon, was not ready to receive aircraft. Repair crews
worked on runways and terminals damaged by shellfire and rockets.
   Police said one person was killed and five were wounded in
shelling that stopped 35 minutes before Beirut's Museum crossing and
the Madfoun gateway, linking the Christian region with
Syrian-policed north Lebanon, reopened around midday.
   Hundreds of pedestrians and motorists flooded the Museum crossing
after Moslem troops lifted containers and knocked down earthmounds
blocking the gateway at the Green Line dividing Beirut into Moslem
and Christian sectors.
   Many travelers, some carrying food and other supplies, cried for
joy as Moslem units of the Lebanese army ushered them across to
Christian east Beirut.
   ``They didn't take away the vegetables. This is the first time in
more than three months they allow me to carry vegetables to east
Beirut,'' cried one woman, her eyes brimming with tears.
   Troops frisked pedestrians and searched cars for weapons.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who heads the Moslem Cabinet in
the dual government, said lifting the land siege and reopening the
airport are ``a basic step toward resolving the crisis.''
   There was no comment on today's developments from Aoun.
   He met with the ambassadors of the United States, France and
Britain to complain about the sea blockade and was to meet the
Chinese and Soviet envoys later today.
   More than 1 million Christians were trapped by the blockade and
siege. By police count, 397 people have been killed and 1,538
wounded since March 8, when Druse fighters retaliated against Aoun's
blockading of illegal ports run by them and other Syrian-backed
Moslem militias.
   Syrian troops in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping
mandate backed the Druse militiamen of warlord Walid Jumblatt and
joined the battle to ensure the blockade.
   Aoun has pledged to oust the Syrian troops from Lebanon. But he
has only about 20,000 fighters while Syria deploys 40,000 troops in
the country and can call on allied militias that command another
40,000 fighters.
   The prestigious daily newspaper An-Nahar today said Syria has
tightened its sea blockade. It said a gunboat on Monday intercepted
a ship carrying passengers and cargo from south Lebanon to the
northern port of Jounieh.
   ``A Syrian officer boarded the ship and searched it for weapons.
When he found only food supplies and passengers, the officer warned
the vessel's Egyptian captain not to use the route again,'' the
paper said.

   A Soviet MiG-23 fighter jet today
crashed into a house near the French border, killing one person,
officials said. The pilot apparently had bailed out.
   Two U.S. Air Force F-15 jets intercepted the plane after it
crossed into Western European airspace and escorted it until it
crashed.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Gaston Bourlet said the plane crashed
at 10:37 a.m. in Wevelgem, a town on the French border about 50
miles west of Brussels.
   Emmanuel de Bethune, mayor of the nearby town of Kortrijk, said
an 18-year-old man was killed when the plane crashed into a bedroom
of his home.
   The whereabouts of the pilot were unknown. Nor was it known from
where the combat plane had taken off or what weapons it carried.
   Bourlet said the MiG-23 had entered Belgium near the Dutch-German
border, 125 miles from the crash site. Officials said it was
monitored crossing into West German airspace from East Germany and
failed to respond to radio calls.
   In Washington, a Defense Department spokesman, Air Force Maj.
Mike Stepp, said two F-15s from Soesterberg Air Base in the
Netherlands intercepted the aircraft, which ``had no canopy and no
pilot.''
   Asked what happened to the Soviet pilot, the spokesman said that
wasn't immediately clear, but it appeared he must have ejected from
the plane. ``I have to assume the aircraft didn't take off by
itself,'' he said.
   The Belgian news agency Belga said the MiG-23 had taken off from
East Germany. A West German Defense Ministry official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, said he was ``assuming that the pilot
ejected from the aircraft over Poland or East Germany.''

   A thousand firefighters today
battled a blaze roaring through canyons dotted with expensive homes.
The flames jumped from the brush to rooftops, burning 29 houses and
forcing out 500 people.
   The firefighters summoned from throughout Southern California
worked into a sweltering Independence Day to control the 1,500-acre
fire as it edged toward ridgetop homes in the Turnbull Canyon area
20 miles from downtown Los Angeles.
   Fires also burned Monday in eastern Utah, near Dinosaur National
Monument in northwestern Colorado and in New Mexico, where a
2,500-acre blaze near Diamond Peak in the Gila National Forest raged
out of control.
   The California fire began in an uninhabited, remote brushy area
and spread quickly to areas with homes valued at $300,000 to more
than $1 million.
   Firefighters hoped to surround the blaze by late today, said Los
Angeles County Fire Department Inspector Ken Sotro. Ten homes were
destroyed and 19 sustained major damage, and three firefighters
suffered minor injuries, he said.
   High humidity and relatively cool weather overnight helped
firefighters gain ground, Sotro said. But the Fourth of July
forecast for possibly high winds and temperatures over 100 degrees
worried firefighters after dawn.
   The fire was believed to have been caused by people, fire
Inspector John Lenihan said.
   ``Every little canyon is a finger of fire,'' he said, adding that
the terrain made the fire extremely difficult to surround.
   About 500 people arrived at Los Altos High School, which was
converted into an evacuation center. Most signed in to let
authorities know they escaped unharmed and then moved on to stay
with friends or at nearby motels.
   Some evacuees said the fire forced them out of their homes so
quickly they had to leave their possessions behind.
   ``They gave me five seconds _ I got nothing,'' said Joan Campbell.
   Sharon and Dick Hartman waited out the blaze near the fire
command post, sitting beside a van loaded with four caged birds, two
dogs and household items. ``What we grabbed were animals and
heirlooms, '' said Mrs. Hartman.
   The fire jumped through steep brush-filled canyons between the
ridgetop homes, Lenihan said.
   A black plume of smoke several thousand feet high could be seen
for at least 20 miles. Neighborhood streets were abandoned and
several residents turned on lawn sprinklers before fleeing. The few
roads to the area were closed.
   In Utah, crews worked to close lines around brush fires caused by
lightning. The fires scorched more than 635 acres in two Uintah
Basin forests and a third blaze broke out Monday in the upper
reaches of Uinta Canyon, 20 miles north of Roosevelt.
   The largest of several fires in Colorado, the Box Canyon Fire in
the northwest corner of the state, had spread by Monday to 1,520
acres of federal Bureau of Land Management property south of
Dinosaur National Monument.
   The fire was sparked by lightning Thursday and was declared near
containment at 190 acres early Sunday. But it erupted again and
reached 720 acres because of extremely dry conditions and rough
terrain.
   Fire danger was high across the state Monday.
   ``It's so dry, one firecracker will be enough,'' said Kris
Damsgaard of the U.S. Forest Service.
   A 2,500-acre blaze near Diamond Peak in the Gila National Forest
in New Mexico burned out of control. Firefighters managed to get a
2,840-acre fire southwest of Roswell under control Monday.
   Nearly 550 firefighters, along with five air tankers and eight
helicopters, battled the Divide fire, which straddles the
Continental Divide at the 9,000-foot level of Diamond Peak.
   ``It is burning out of control,'' said U.S. Forest Service
spokesman Ron Henderson. ``but if the winds lay down we can get a
hold of it within the next couple days. That's our biggest enemy
right now _ the wind.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An independent opposition entered an East
bloc legislature for the first time in more than four decades as
Solidarity and Communist-backed lawmakers today took a common oath
of office.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, head
of the Communist Party, watched the ceremony from seats near the
front of the Sejm, or parliament. It was broadcast live on state
television.
   ``We are starting the term of the Sejm, which may pass into
history as a great one. It can fulfill the expectations of our
society,'' said Zbigniew Rudnicki, the 60-year-old senior member of
the chamber who presided over the session.
   ``The eyes of 38 million Poles that live in the country are
directed to our changes. More lively still beat the hearts of Poles
all over the world from Chicago to Kazakhstan,'' he said.
   Rudnicki called on each deputy by name. They promised to work for
Poland's good in a oath that deleted a reference to its ``socialist
development.''
   Solidarity supporters claim 161 seats in the 460-member Sejm and
98 seats in a new 100-member Senate that was to meet later today.
   Electing a speaker was the first order of business and
sociologist Mikolaj Kozakiewicz of the Peasant Party met opposition,
although no other candidates ran. He was elected by 293 to 81, with
60 absentions.
   ``I will perform this function ... not bow before the mighty
rulers, ideologies or institutions,'' Kozakiewicz told the chamber.
Three vice marshals were elected from the Communist Party, the
Democratic Party and the opposition.
   Kozakiewicz recommended the chamber discuss a new government once
it elects a president. The president names a prime minister who
forms a government.
   Solidarity deputy Jacek Kuron harshly criticized the government
of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, saying its ``chaotic
policy caused only social unrest.''
   There is an intense political struggle over who will be elected
in two days when the Sejm and Senate meet together.
   Jaruzelski said Friday he did not want the post and instead
recommended Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak. But Jaruzelski
was believed to be reconsidering this week at the urging of some
party members.
   The key issue appeared to be whether Jaruzelski would survive a
vote in the National Assembly, where the communist coalition holds
300 of 560 seats.
   Solidarity lawmakers have said they will vote against him, and it
is uncertain how many votes Jaruzelski can count on within his own
coalition.
   He acknowledged last week that he remains unpopular for imposing
martial law and crushing Solidarity, the East bloc's first
independent labor movement, in December 1981. The group was
re-legalized earlier this year.
   A leading opposition theorist proposed Monday that Solidarity
support a Communist candidate for president in exchange for a union
candidate taking the prime minister's office and forming the next
government.
   The proposal by Adam Michnik, a historian and essayist, in the
opposition's Election Gazette drew no immediate response from
authorities.
   The presidential election is timed to take place before President
Bush arrives in Poland on Sunday for a three-day visit.
   After Bush leaves, the legislators must choose a prime minister
and appoint the government to deal with skyrocketing inflation and
severe consumer shortages.
   The Polish legislature has not had such an opposition presence
since 1947, when the Commmunists consolidated power through
intimidation, forcing opposition leader Stanislaw Mikolayczyk into
exile.
   The new political arrangement stems from an agreement in April
between Communist authorities and the Solidarity-led opposition.
   That pact allowed the lifting of the seven-year ban on
Solidarity, provided for the country's freest elections of the
postwar period, and restored the Senate and presidency.

   The fight over abortion, called ``our Vietnam
of the 1990s'' by one partisan, returns to 50 state legislatures
with new intensity sparked by the latest Supreme Court ruling.
   But the high court's role in the deeply divisive legal and
political struggle is far from over.
   Ending its 1988-89 term Monday, the court cut back sharply on
women's constitutional right to abortion. But it stopped short of
letting states outlaw most abortions.
   The justices also said that sometime in 1990 they will decide
three new disputes _ a move that could lead them to scrap the
court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade legalizing abortion.
   That would let states regulate abortion more stringently, or even
outlaw it.
   ``I think clearly the Supreme Court seems to be authorizing the
states to apply restrictive language and legislation to the
decision, and I think we're going to see some states become quite
restrictive,'' House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said today on
``CBS This Morning.''
   ``I think the debate will heat up rather dramatically if both
sides attempt to reach legislative decisions on the state level,''
he said.
   ``This decision indicates that Roe's days are numbered,'' said
Randall Terry of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.
   Kate Michelman of the National Abortion Rights Action League
said, ``Women's lives hang by a thread, and the justices handed
politicians a pair of scissors.''
   Activists for both sides pledged renewed efforts to lobby state
legislators and make abortion the major issue in state and local
elections.
   ``Every person who stands for election in this country is going
to have to answer,'' said Molly Yard, president of the National
Organization for Women.
   Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee called
the decision ``an invitation ... to the states to begin to restore
protection to unborn children.'' He added, ``I'm sure that a number
of legislatures will accept the invitation.''
   Judith Widdicombe, founder of the Missouri abortion clinic
involved in the high court ruling, said, ``This is the beginning of
a war. It will become our Vietnam of the 1990s.''
   In its closest-watched case of the decade, the court gave states
greater power to make abortions harder to get.
   The justices, by 5-4 votes, restored key provisions of a Missouri
abortion law _ allowing it and all other states to ban any public
employee from helping perform an abortion and to ban abortions in
all public hospitals, even when patients are willing to pay for them.
   The court also ruled states may require doctors to determine
through various tests whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is
``viable'' or capable of surviving outside the womb. Missouri and
many states make it a crime to abort a viable fetus, but the 1973
decision had drawn the viability line at 24 weeks.
   It appears now that a clear-cut court majority _ Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist and Justices Byron R. White, Anthony M.
Kennedy, Antonin Scalia and Sandra Day O'Connor _ believe Roe vs.
Wade was wrongly decided.
   If not for O'Connor's reluctance for procedural reasons, the 1973
landmark essentially would have been swept away in the Missouri case.
   O'Connor, the court's only woman, will cast the key vote in next
term's abortion showdown, when the court could for the first time in
over 200 years take away a constitutional right it had created.
   If so, the word will come in a case from Illinois, Ohio or
Minnesota. The court agreed to study all three after returning from
its three-month summer recess on the first Monday in October.
   The Illinois case stems from that state's unsuccessful attempt to
enforce extensive regulations on abortion clinics.
   A federal trial judge and the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
said the Illinois regulations would have forced abortion clinics to
become ``the functional equivalent of small hospitals'' for no valid
purpose.
   The invalidated Ohio abortion law generally required doctors to
notify a parent of young, unmarried girls before performing
abortions.
   Lower courts said the law impermissibly interfered with some
girls' constitutional right to seek an abortion.
   The law would have required any doctor asked to perform an
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girl's
parents or perhaps some other family member at least 24 hours before
the operation.
   Young girls could seek to bypass parental notification by seeking
the permission of a state judge to have an abortion.
   The Minnesota law requires some girls to tell both parents at
least 48 hours before having an abortion. It was upheld by a federal
appeals court but enforcement was stayed pending review by the
nation's highest court.
   The 1981 law requires unmarried girls under 18 and still living
with a parent to provide written notice to both parents, if
possible, before obtaining an abortion.
   The law also imposed a 48-hour waiting period, and made doctors
who perform abortions criminally liable for violations.

   U.S. diplomats today marked Independence Day
behind the iron bars of their embassy compound, singing ``America
the Beautiful'' and holding a flag ceremony while Chinese guards
with automatic weapons patrolled outside.
   Chinese security officials said today they had arrested a
Taiwanese journalist and charged him with sheltering one of the
nation's most-wanted student leaders of the recently crushed
pro-democracy movement.
   Two protest leaders who escaped today announced the establishment
of an organization to carry on their fight for a freer China.
Student leader Wu'er Kaixi and intellectual Yan Jiaqi made their
comments in a statement seen in Hong Kong and Paris.
   In the British colony of Hong Kong, which reverts to Chinese rule
in 1997, thousands of residents protested the crackdown and
Britain's refusal to offer refuge to Hong Kong's 5.7 million people.
   Premier Li Peng, who ordered the crackdown, was portrayed on
posters as Count Dracula. British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe was depicted as a bumbling panda.
   In Beijing, both the U.S. and Australian embassies were being
watched carefully by Chinese soldiers. China's leading dissident,
Fang Lizhi, and his wife, Li Shuxian, are being sheltered at the
American Embassy.
   The Australian Embassy has denied rumors that a student who
helped lead the pro-democracy protests is hiding there.
   Foreign embassies in Beijing always are guarded by Chinese
police, but those around the U.S. and Australian embassies carried
automatic weapons and were reinforced by extra uniformed and
plainclothes officers.
   During past July 4 celebrations, large receptions were held at
the U.S. Embassy, and Chinese officials were invited. Today, only
embassy staff were invited to the brief flag ceremony. Diplomats
gathered to sing ``America the Beautiful.''
   Several dozen Chinese bicycling past the embassy paused to watch
but the guards, with guns pointed, moved them along.
   There was no comment from China's government on U.S. allegations
Monday that Chinese soldiers intentionally fired on diplomats'
apartments June 7, during a purported search for a sniper.
   No one was injured in the incident, but a U.S. Embassy report
said several apartments were hit with bullets.
   Chinese police say they had come under fire from snipers and were
firing in self-defense. The official Xinhua News Agency called the
U.S. allegation ``a lie.''
   The shooting occurred three days after China's military moved
into Tiananmen Square to crush a 7-week-old student-led campaign for
a freer society. Official Chinese reports say about 300 people died
in the June 3-4 crackdown, including many soldiers and police.
Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say the death
toll could be as high as 3,000.
   The U.S. government criticized the crackdown and has suspended
military sales to China and high-level contacts.
   The Ministry of State Security, China's KGB, said a Taiwanese
reporter, Huang Teh-pei of the Independence Morning Post, had been
charged with plotting with a fugitive _ one of the student leaders _
and helping and hiding him.
   Guan Ping, director of the ministry's Foreign Affairs Office, met
today with two other Taiwanese reporters and announced the charges.
One of the two, Antonio Jiang, said he refused to let them see Huang.
   The charges stemmed from Huang's reported meeting Sunday with
student leader Wang Dan, who is one of the most wanted fugitives in
China. Huang was arrested Monday.
   Jiang said Guan refused to say where Wang was. Police and city
officials have said they don't know if Wang is under arrest.
   Wu'er and Yan, the two students who escaped China, are believed
hiding in Paris. French television today showed a videotape of them
in which they vowed not to ``betray the dead of Beijing'' and said
they were forming a ``united committee of democratic movements'' to
bring together all Chinese seeking democracy.
   The statement also was made available in writing in Hong Kong by
activists there.
   Howe, the British foreign secretary, said today China will have
to take ``a whole series of actions'' to restore confidence in Hong
Kong.
   He also urged the United States and other nations to refrain from
imposing further economic sanctions on China, which he said would
seriously damage the colony.
   The comments came at the end of a three-day fact-finding visit,
during which he was widely criticized because of Britain's refusal
to offer refuge to Hong Kong's residents.
   About 6,000 people marched through Hong Kong's streets, carrying
posters and shouting ``Down with Communism! Down with the Communist
Party!''

   President Bush, spending a private
Independence Day with his family, received a call from Indian Prime
Minister Rajiv Gandhi this morning wishing him a happy holiday, the
White House said.
   Gandhi told him the Fourth of July is an important day for all
democracies and said the U.S. founding fathers had a great impact on
the Indian constitution, according to a news release issued by
Bush's staff at the vacationing White House in Maine.
   The president and Mrs. Bush pitched in to clean up debris from
the massive fireworks display over their home Monday night, the
White House said.
   Bush planned to spend most of the day at the family compound at
Walker's Point, playing tennis and boating. He also was reviewing
briefing materials for his upcoming trip to Europe, said press
secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   The president is preparing for his visit to Poland by staking out
a position likely to go over well there _ a call for the Soviet
Union to withdraw its troops from the East bloc nation.
   Bush, who leaves Sunday for a stop in Poland on his way to the
European economic summit, said the Soviets should pull out of Poland
and take ``an historic opportunity to help end the postwar division
in Europe.''
   On another matter, the White House said Bush called Turkish
Premier Turgut Ozal Monday to ``express his concern about the
maltreatment and forced expulsion of the Turkish ethnic minorities
from Bulgaria.''
   The statement gave no further details of the president's
conversation with Ozal, whose office announced the phone call Monday.
   Since he will be traveling next week, Bush on Monday called King
Hassan of Morocco to express his regards on the king's 60th
birthday, which falls during that time.
   Bush told the king the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff,
Admiral William Crowe, will represent the United States at the
King's birthday celebrations. Crowe announced on Sunday that he will
resign from the military in September and Bush told reporters he
wished Crowe had decided to stay on as chairman.
   The White House staff released a text Monday of Bush's interview
with a group of Polish reporters in which Bush made the proposal on
Soviet troops. The interview on Friday marked the first time he has
called for a total pullout.
   The news came on a day when Bush also issued a statement
applauding the Supreme Court's decision opening the door to more
restrictions on abortions.
   Bush said he welcomed the court's move to let states tackle the
issue of how they want to limit abortion. ``The court appears to
have begun to restore to the people the ability to protect the
unborn,'' he said.
   He called further for the reversal of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade
decision that legalized abortion, a ruling the court stopped short
of overturning Monday.
   Bush was on the golf course Monday when his staff released the
statement, and he told reporters with him he had ``very strong
feelings'' on the subject.
   Bush's chief of staff, John Sununu, told reporters Bush still
backs a constitutional amendment against abortion, and that he will
focus his attention on that rather than getting involved in state
legislative fights over abortion where he might be seen as meddling
in state affairs.
   Later Monday night, Bush got an early start on Independence Day
festivities by hosting a lavish fireworks show for neighbors, with
the explosions cascading over his family compound at Walker's Point.
   Bush had some 200 family and friends at the complex for the show,
which the White House said was funded by an anonymous donor.
   Bush told the Polish reporters he hopes to deliver his promised
economic incentives to Poland as a reward for its recent steps
toward democracy. But he said: ``We need to know that you're going
to be able to not only continue existing reforms, but expand on
reforms so that the economic system that works will be given a
chance to work unfettered.''
   Soviet troop withdrawal would be a good move, he said, because
``there is no danger at all of an invasion of Poland from the
West,'' and thus no need for large conventional forces.
   ``Very candidly, I would like to see Soviet troops ... out,''
Bush said

<TEXT>
   Meter readers have been in the doghouse
since pet owners discovered the utility keeps a list of homes with
hostile hounds.
   To help employees avoid dog bites, the Green Bay Water Utility
has kept track of dangerous yards for almost 40 years. Two months
ago, the city began using the list to notify homes their dogs had to
be licensed.
   Some people who received the letters accused the utility's three
meter readers of spying.
   Utility office manager Keith Mueller said someone telephoned and
demanded: ``What's next? Are you going to watch to make sure I
control my noxious weeds?''
   Another caller declared: ``You're dead meat.''
   Someone mailed a water payment in an envelope addressed ``Dog
Catchers Inc.''
   About 200 of the people who got letters replied they did not own
dogs.
   Mueller said that when the mayor's office requested the list, the
utility was not immediately aware why. The list is programmed into
hand-held computers that meter readers consult before venturing onto
a property.
   Use of the list has paid off. Since notices were mailed at the
end of April, license fees received by the city this year went from
less than $5,400 to more than $19,500.
   Mueller said the complaints have tailed off, and he hopes it
stays that way.
   ``No pun intended, but let a sleeping dog lie,'' he said.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A city's attempt to regulate the location of
newsracks selling a non-obscene sex newspaper was struck down by a
state appeals court.
   The court rejected the city of Alameda's argument that The
Spectator was entitled to no more legal protection than adult
theaters or bookstores, which can be kept away from residential
areas and schools through zoning ordinances.
   Newsracks are not the same as adult bookstores and theaters,
Justice Donald King said in the 3-0 opinion Monday.
   ``There are no flashing lights or gaudy displays. There is no
steady stream of lingering customers. The product is not intended to
be consumed at the site of its purchase,'' King wrote.
   The judge said the city's restrictions were based solely on the
content of The Spectator, which has not been found obscene and is
thus protected by the First Amendment.
   ``They dared the courts to obliterate the First Amendment and
lost the gamble,'' said Amitai Schwartz, a lawyer for the tabloid.
   Chuck Corica, mayor of the city of 76,000, said the City Council
may appeal.
   ``There are very many mothers in Alameda concerned about this,''
he said. ``We are not attempting to skirt the First Amendment, not
saying you can't purchase The Spectator, just want to make it
difficult for small children to get hold of it.''
   Alameda's ordinance, which was never enforced, banned sales of
sexually oriented material in newsracks within 500 feet of
residential areas.
   Upholding a lower court, the appeals court said zoning
restrictions on sex-oriented bookstores and theaters are based on
the harm to the neighborhood.
   ``Neither prior cases, independent studies nor common sense have
yet demonstrated that adult newsracks downgrade neighborhoods,''
King said.

   A moderate earthquake struck the island of Oshima
and nearby areas Tuesday night, but there were no reports of damage
or injury.
   The quake, which struck at 10:18 p.m. (9:18 a.m. EDT) and was
centered about six miles in the sea off the Izu peninsula, measured
4.9 on the Richter scale, according to the Central Meteorological
Agency.
   Oshima is 72 miles southwest of Tokyo.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times
stronger than one of 6.5.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight damage
in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, 6
severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage.

<HEAD>Emigration Up Again to Nearly 4,000 in June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nearly 4,000 Jews left the Soviet Union in June, a
new rise in emigration that makes the exodus in the first six months
of 1989 bigger than that in all of 1988, a resettlement agency said
Tuesday.
   This year, 20,162 Soviet Jews have been allowed to leave the
country, the Intergovernmental Committee for Migration said,
compared with a 1988 total of 20,082 _ the highest outflow since
1980.
   In June, 3,965 emigres arrived in Vienna, the second-highest
total this year after April. Of these, 89 decided to go to Israel,
said committee spokeswoman Regina Boucault.
   Only 613 emigrants _ 3 percent of the total _ have chosen to
resettle in Israel this year, she said. Most are going to the United
States.
   Emigration has soared to twice last year's rate, a move seen
partly as a Soviet effort to improve ties with Israel.
   About 300,000 Soviet Jews have emigrated since the resettlement
program began in 1971. The largest official exodus, 51,328, was
recorded in 1979, before the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan
chilled East-West relations.
   Between 1971 and 1978, more than three quarters of all emigrants
settled in Israel. In the past three years, the share fell to about
one quarter before taking a new plunge last year when Israel faced
mounting economic problems and a Palestinian uprising in the
occupied territories.

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Haughey couldn't win power
outright in an election and now he can't swallow the prospect of
sharing it with another party.
   So Ireland has been without a new government for nearly a week,
and the solution may hinge on a widely shared aversion to yet
another election.
   ``There'll be an election over my dead body,'' says Terry Leyden,
a lawmaker of Haughey's Fianna Fail party.
   Haughey was forced to resign last week after failing to win
re-election by Parliament as taoiseach, or prime minister.
   That left him with two choices: call another election, or form a
coalition with another party. He rejected both.
   The Dail, or Parliament, has given him until Thursday to produce
a government. Instead of overtures of compromise, however, public
positions have hardened.
   A front-page cartoon in The Irish Times on Tuesday showed Haughey
preparing to march under defiant banners: ``No Surrender'' and ``No
to Power Sharing.''
   Those, as every Irish citizen knows, are the slogans of Northern
Ireland's hard-line Protestants, who have no love for Haughey or his
Irish Republic.
   ``You cannot go on as if an election had never been held and
ignoring the reality. Nobody won the election,'' Jim Kemmy, the only
Democratic Socialist in the Dail, told Haughey on Monday.
   In the June 15 election, Fianna Fail's strength in the Dail fell
from 80 to 77 seats.
   Fine Gael gained four seats, for a total of 55, but its coalition
partners, the Progressive Democrats, fell from 14 to six.
   ``We recognize there is a totally changed situation,'' said
Haughey.
   Nonetheless, he has sought to recreate the pre-election
situation, when Fianna Fail ruled as a minority government with
support from Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats.
   The old partners, however, demand new terms. ``It was clear to
anybody with any political sense that a new approach was needed,''
said Alan Dukes, Fine Gael's leader.
   Dukes offered Haughey a 50-50 share of cabinet seats in a
coalition. Desmond O'Malley, leader of the Progressive Democrats,
offered his party's six votes _ exactly the number needed _ in
return for Cabinet seats.
   ``Coalitions don't work,'' Haughey said.
   Although his party won only 44 percent of the popular vote and a
like proportion of the seats, Haughey claimed a mandate on the
grounds that Fianna Fail got the most votes.
   ``We are fulfilling the democratic wish of the people in seeking
to form a minority Fianna Fail government,'' Haughey said Sunday.
   Resistance to a coalition runs deep in Fianna Fail, which
conceives of itself more as a popular movement than a political
party.
   Noel Dempsey, a Fianna Fail deputy from Meath, said his
constituents disliked coalitions and ``they're prepared to go to the
country on the issue.''
   Since forming its first government in 1932, Fianna Fail has
dominated Irish politics, always winning between 42 to 52 percent of
the vote.
   The rivalry between Fianna Fail and Fine Gael is old as the civil
war that their founders fought on opposing sides in 1922-23.
   Strains between Fianna Fail and the Progressive Democrats,
however, are recent and personal. O'Malley was involved in two
attempts to remove Haughey as Fianna Fail leader and was finally
expelled from Fianna Fail in 1985, which makes it doubly irksome for
Haughey to have him at his Cabinet table.
   ``We are not in the business of recrimination, of settling old
scores of forcing others to eat their words or political humble
pie,'' O'Malley said in the Dail Monday.
   Paul McNulty, a Fianna Fail adviser, said a coalition wouldn't
work because the Progressive Democrats are a ``yuppie'' party while
Fianna Fail has ``its roots firmly planted in the less-privileged
sector of Irish society.''
   The Democrats, he added, lacked Fianna Fail's commitment, hardly
mentioned in the election campaign, to uniting the Irish Republic
and British-ruled Northern Ireland.
   Although it came second in the election, Fine Gael conceivably
could form a coalition with the Progressive Democrats and two
leftist Labor Party and Workers Party. But the left isn't dealing.
   Fianna Fail, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats won 138 of
the Dail's 166 seats, and Workers Party chairman Proinsias De Rossa,
said: ``It is up to them to sit down and implement that mandate.''

   A man bench-pressing 295 pounds
died after dropping the barbell on his throat, authorities said.

Vancouver, died at a hospital Friday. He was working out alone at a
health club and had previously refused offers to use ``spotters'' in
case of an accident, said Detective Sgt. Doug Bond.
   When a club staff member discovered English, ``the barbell was
across his throat and he was blue,'' Bond said Monday.
   ``The night manager told me he had exactly the same thing happen
to him, but he had spotters there, and they pulled the weight off
before any damage was done,'' the detective said.

   Liberal members of Congress concede there is
little support on Capitol Hill for legislation to roll back the new
Supreme Court decision on abortion.
   But they suggest the restrictions the court said states could
impose will in time spark such a strong public outcry that Congress
will enact bills counteracting the ruling.
   Jubilant conservatives, meanwhile, promised to press ahead with
efforts to further restrict abortions.
   Ruling in a Missouri case, the court said Monday that states may
refuse to allow tax dollars and public facilities to be used for
abortions and may require doctors to determine through various tests
whether a fetus at least 20 weeks old is capable of surviving
outside the womb.
   In that decision, the divided court chipped away at the
constitutional right to an abortion, a right it had spelled out in
the landmark Roe Vs. Wade case in 1973. And it scheduled three more
abortion cases for its fall term.
   ``Now we have to start the battle to keep that chipping process
from taking place,'' Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee, said of liberal lawmakers'
next steps.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the Judiciary
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights, said he believed
support in both houses of Congress to overturn the court ruling was
lacking. But he predicted the decision would ``energize'' the
public, and consequently lawmakers.
   ``I predict we'll have a majority in both the House and Senate
for either a statute or constitutional amendment in a relatively
short time,'' he said. ``This is going to be a real national
battleground.''
   But he conceded that could take months or even years.
   Congress has been moving in the other direction in recent years,
in the face of politically active abortion opponents, approving
restrictions on the use of federal money for abortions.
   However, Edwards predicted congressional support for defending
abortion would swell gradually as women run into roadblocks to
ending pregnancies.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., one of Congress' most stalwart abortion
foes, said he believed the court's ruling would make battles on
Capitol Hill even more vigorous. Abortion supporters, eyeing the
Supreme Court's ruling, would realize their only option is to pass
legislation, he said.
   ``We're in for a revived and renewed struggle over this issue for
some time,'' he said.
   Another anti-abortion activist, Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J.,
said Monday's ruling had led him to explore whether the court was
opening up avenues for new legislative restrictions.
   He said he and his allies are considering bills to bar federal
assistance to private groups that perform abortions or abortion
counseling, and to severely limit the legality of the procedure in
Washington, D.C., and the U.S. territories, where Congress has
direct legislative power.
   On the other side, Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., said she
would soon introduce legislation to increase federal research into
contraceptives, in part to use it to gauge support among her
colleagues for abortion. Public support, she agreed, would be
crucial.
   ``You're not going to have the votes until members start hearing
from the other side,'' she said.

<HEAD>Baker Says Increased Aid Needed to Help Philippine Economy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III told an
international gathering Tuesday that nations must pledge increased
aid to the Philippines to ensure the ``fragile'' young democracy
survives.
   The Philippines foreign secretary, Raul Manglapus, said it was
appropriate that the opening of the three-day session coincided with
the United States' Independence Day, and he called it ``a conclave
of democracy.''
   Delegates from more than a dozen countries and seven
international organizations are meeting to discuss the Philippines
Multilateral Aid Initiative, a plan aimed at protecting the key
Southeast Asian country.
   The purpose of the meeting, Baker said, ``is much more than
strengthening economic reform in one country. It is to express in
tangible ways our commitment to the success of democracy and
freedom.''
   ``Democracy in the Philippines remains fragile and under
attack,'' he told delegates.
   President Bush has asked Congress for an additional $200 million
in annual aid to help reach a goal of $10 billion in the next five
years for the Philippines, where the United States has six military
bases.
   The delegates praised economic and social reforms started since
Corazon Aquino became president of the Philippines in 1986 after the
ouster of Ferdinand Marcos, but they also heard of the difficulties
the country faces.
   Almost half of the Philippine people live under the
government-set poverty line, the foreign debt is $28 billion, and
communist rebels have been fighting for 20 years to topple the
government.
   Mrs. Aquino, speaking on a videotape shown to the conference,
said the Philippine people had ``succeeded against overwhelming
odds'' in restoring democratic institutions since Marcos' 20-year
rule ended.
   ``We now ask for your help in the more arduous task of protecting
and sustaining those gains by providing us the means to maintain a
viable and prosperous economy which can serve as a solid base for
social and political stability,'' she said.
   Japan, the source of about half the Philippines' bilateral aid,
said it was increasing its aid this year to about $1 billion from
$899 million last year.
   The European Community said its aid would roughly triple from the
recent annual average of $117 million to about $350 million.
   Baker, who arrived Tuesday for a 22-hour stopover, travels
Wednesday to Brunei to attend a meeting with foreign ministers of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Its members are
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines and Brunei.
   Baker held separate meetings with Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke
Uno and Foreign Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka and discussed bilateral
trade problems and turmoil in China, Japanese and U.S. officials
said.
   Uno appears in an increasingly weak political position. His
governing party suffered a major setback in weekend voting for the
Tokyo city legislature, and he is plagued by allegations he kept
several paid mistresses.
   Baker, speaking to reporters during the 17-hour flight from
Washington, said it is important to ``studiously avoid involving
ourselves in the internal affairs of the government of Japan.''

Court ruling on abortion:
</TEXT>
<NOTE>Tulsa World:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court has delivered another fuzzy 5-4 ruling on
abortion which, according to Justice Harry Blackmun, sets the stage
for further attacks on the right to privacy affirmed in Roe vs. Wade
in 1973.
   The immediate effect of the new ruling ... falls short of
repealing a woman's right to early term abortions. But the decision
shows where the court's majority stands. Here is a self-described
``conservative'' majority calling for more state interference in a
matter of the utmost privacy _ the question of whether to reproduce.
   In short, the ruling denies abortion to those who can least
afford the consequences of an unwanted pregnancy.
   Monday, July 3, a bad day for individual freedom.

   To hear activists on both sides tell it, yesterday marked the
beginning of the end of legal abortion in America. Such hype seemed
to flow naturally from a Supreme Court decision that was deemed
momentous before a single justice set word to paper. But, truth be

abortion and gave no clear indication that it was ready to go
further in the next session.

   The Supreme Court Monday acted properly in reaffirming the right
of a woman to choose an abortion. The United States cannot afford to
head down the path to back alley abortions that pose a severe threat
to the lives of women.
   Unfortunately, the decision also has opened the door to
legislative meddling that could impede women from exercising that
right.

   The United States Supreme Court has left standing the right of
women to an abortion, but what a Pyrrhic victory for women it is and
what a defeat for justice under law! For the American system of
jurisprudence, the court's long-awaited review of the Roe vs. Wade
abortion decision ended in the worst of all possible ways.
   By encouraging states to find ways to restrict abortions, the
court took a giant step along the course it began this decade, which
is to turn abortion from a right into a privilege of the well-to-do.
The limitations always are barriers to pregnant children and poor
women, the most vulnerable, and they clearly will soon have little
choice to bearing unwanted babies.

   The absence of public subsidies will probably limit the
availability of abortion to some women in some places _ and to that
extent, the court will regret the social consequences of its
decision.
   But the abortion debate will not be settled in the streets. Those
who harass and intimidate women at a painful moment in their lives
gain no sympathy for their cause; and those who believe that the
court has declared ``war against women'' fail to comprehend this
difficult, complex problem. The right to abortion remains intact;
the means to abortion are under review.

   Probably the worst ill this wind will blow is the prospect of

chipped away bit by bit till only a shell or a shadow remains. If

   The state _ certainly any civilized, humane state _ must have an
interest in protecting potential human life. When that interest is
non-existent, a state and a people are soon barren of ethical and
moral values.
   This country has traveled some distance on that road already. A
survey of medical geneticists taken earlier this year showed that a
full 20 percent of them approved of abortion based solely on the sex
of the unborn child.
   When medical professionals begin to countenance the taking of
life _ even potential life _ simply because it is not the right
gender, then something is terribly wrong. And there are millions and
millions of Americans who believe that the wrong took root 16 years
ago.

   The U.S. Supreme Court has set the stage for the worst scenario
possible in the battle over the rights of mothers and fetuses.
   And it has acted in total disregard of the fact that abortions
will continue to be performed with or without legal sanction _ and
without the health safeguards that were imposed on physicians under
the historic 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling establishing a woman's
constitutional right to an abortion.
   Under Monday's ruling, choice still exists. It will be up to
enlightened states and legislatures to preserve it.

   Its ruling in the Missouri case, depicted by both sides of the
debate as a start in dismantling Roe, is really a return to the
court's original version.
   That is a healthy step. Most Americans, to judge from the polls,
aren't willing to make abortion illegal. But they are troubled at
seeing the matter put beyond the reach of social control. This time,
the court reflected the nation's ambivalence. It left Roe intact,
ignoring demands that it return to the pre-1973 status quo. But it
sanctioned a few restrictions.
   For the time being, and perhaps beyond, the court finds that, on
abortion, it is most comfortable alongside most Americans _
somewhere in the middle.

<HEAD>Federal Reserve Action Expected to Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Policy-makers at the Federal Reserve will
continue easing credit in an effort to keep a sluggish economy from
sliding into recession, many analysts believe. That should translate
into good news for borrowers.
   Costs of a variety of loans, including mortgage rates and home
equity loans, all are expected to head lower through the rest of the
summer, private economists say.
   The Federal Open Market Committee, composed of members of the
Federal Reserve Board in Washington and five of the 12 regional Fed
bank presidents, will meet Wednesday and Thursday for an important
mid-year review of where monetary policy is going.
   The central bank, through its control of interest rates and the
nation's money supply, has a powerful influence over the course of
the economy. It strives to provide enough credit to keep the economy
expanding while guarding against supplying so much money that
inflation is rekindled.
   In March 1988, the Federal Reserve began a credit-tightening
effort which drove interest rates up by 3 full percentage points,
depressing the housing market and sales of such big-ticket items as
autos.
   But last month, in a major policy shift, the central bank sent a
key interest rate, the federal funds rate, down by 0.25 percentage
point to around 9.5 percent.
   This rate, which is the interest that banks charge each other to
make overnight loans, is considered the best early-warning signal of
Fed intentions. The central bank influences the rate through daily
decisions on how much money it will make available to the banking
system.
   In advance of Wednesday's closed-door meeting, many private
economists suggested the FOMC will decide to push the funds rate
down by another one-fourth percentage point.
   ``I expect an easing move because I believe that the Fed is a
little scared about the recent weak economic data and the
possibility we could be heading for a recession,'' said Lawrence
Chimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group, an economic
consulting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.
   The central bank has been struggling to keep alive the record
peacetime economic recovery, now in its seventh year, by engineering
a ``soft-landing'' for the economy. Under that scenario, growth
would slow enough this year to dampen inflationary pressures but not
so much that the country was plunged into a recession.
   Whether the central bank can realize its hopes is an open
question at the current time. Last week's big drop in the stock
market was blamed on growing fears that the country is headed for a
downturn later this year.
   Jerry Jasinowski, chief economist of the National Association of
Manufacturers, noted that a variety of business barometers,
including factory orders, are pointing to significant weakness.
   ``The economy is slowing more rapidly than expected and underlies
the need for the Fed to act promptly to ease monetary policy,'' he
said. ``Failure to act soon may turn the soft landing into a
recession.''
   But David Wyss, senior economist at DRI-McGraw Hill of Lexington,
Mass., said he believed the central bank would be able to keep
inflation under control without throwing the economy into a slump.
   ``We think interest rates are coming down fast enough that this
will be a soft landing,'' Wyss said.
   Mortgage rates are already falling. And Wyss predicted 30-year
mortgages would dip to around 9.5 percent by September.
   Other economists forecast a further one-half percentage point
drop in banks' prime lending rate in August.
   Robert Dederick, executive vice president for Northern Trust Co.
of Chicago, said chairman Alan Greenspan and the other Federal
Reserve officials have no choice but to pursue their current gradual
easing strategy, given pressure from the Bush administration and
Congress to keep the economy out of a recession.
   ``You don't have a public mandate at present to suffer the pain
to make sure that inflation is under control,'' he said. ``Inflation
is always a threat when you start easing credit. But if you wait
until inflation isn't a threat, you have waited right into a
recession.''

<HEAD>Moslems Lift Land Siege Around Christian Enclave</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Syrian-allied Moslem forces reopened
gateways linking the Christian enclave with the rest of Lebanon on
Tuesday, but Syrian gunners bombarded Christian ports to maintain
the sea blockade.
   Police said one person was killed and five wounded in pre-dawn
shelling duels across Beirut's dividing Green Line, bringing the
toll to 397 people killed and 1,538 wounded in the 16-week
confrontation between Gen. Michel Aoun's mainly Christian Lebanese
army troops and Syrian soldiers.
   Syrian gunners stopped their shelling 35 minutes before Moslem
forces lifted the land siege.
   Thousands of civilians flooded the three crossings, in Beirut,
north Lebanon and the mountains east of the capital, after they
reopened to traffic after almost four months.
   ``This is the first time in more than three months they allow me
to carry vegetables to east Beirut,'' said a woman at museum
gateway, her eyes brimming with tears.
   Moslem soldiers searched cars and frisked pedestrians for weapons.
   The Syrian-backed Moslem army command of Maj. Gen. Sami Khatib, a
dissident Lebanese army officer, said private cars will be allowed
to cross into the 310-square-mile Christian enclave for 13 hours
during the day.
   Trucks carrying food and other commodities will be allowed to
cross at night, the statement said. It did not elaborate.
   A source at Aoun's command said the reopening was ``an
encouraging sign.''
   ``We'll wait to see if they allow supplies to cross overnight,''
the source said on condition of anonymity.
   The enclave, home to about 1 million Christians, has been under
siege by Syrian and allied forces since March 14.
   Shiite Moslem militia chieftain Nabih Berri, Syria's closest ally
in Lebanon, announced Monday the land siege would be lifted as ``a
goodwill gesture.''
   It appears to be a guarded response to an Iraqi offer Sunday to
stop supplying arms to Aoun if Syria withdraws from Lebanon. Iraq
and Syria are rivals for influence in the Arab world.
   Berri said Beirut airport also would be reopened Tuesday.
   But the airport police commander, Lt. Col. Ahmed Abu Zaki, said
this was delayed for ``technical reasons.'' Workers on Tuesday were
repairing the airport, closed March 12 after shells exploded on its
runway.
   Salim Salam, general manager of Middle East Airlines, said the
state airline is prepared to resume flights to Beirut airport in 48
hours. Lebanon's is the only airline that uses the airport.
   Aoun did not comment on Tuesday's reopening, decided after a
weekend meeting in Damascus of five Syrian-backed Moslem militia
leaders with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa.
   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, Aoun's rival and head of the
Moslem Cabinet, said the move was ``a basic step toward resolving
the crisis.''
   Aoun had separate meetings with ambassadors of the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union to complain about the sea
blockade Tuesday, the Christian Voice of Lebanon radio said.
   It said Aoun also sent cables to U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar and Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi
about ``the interception by Syrian naval vessels of commercial ships
in Lebanese territorial waters.''
   The independent daily An-Nahar reported Tuesday that Syria has
tightened the blockade.

<HEAD>Doctors, Lawyers Need Anti-Drug Standards, Bennett Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors and lawyers, role models with ``a
special kind of status,'' should impose strict anti-drug standards
on their elite professions, says William J. Bennett, the federal
coordinator of drug-control policy.
   ``If you're serious about this thing, you don't just go battering
down doors in the inner cities,'' Bennett said in an interview. ``To
those who have been given much, much is expected.''
   ``These are people who make a lot of money, who exercise a lot of
influence in society,'' he said. ``They're role models. Doctors and
lawyers, they have a special kind of status. One stands for health,
one stands for lawfulness. There's no good excuse here.''
   Bennett, who has met in the past with heads of sports
organizations and with Hollywood leaders, said he spoke recently
with American Bar Association President Robert Raven and the
American Medical Association's chief executive officer, Dr. James H.
Sammons.
   ``I said the same thing to the head of the ABA that I said to the
sports people: `You must have standards of behavior and discipline
in regard to drugs that are as least as onerous and as serious as
the policies that we see in serious junior high schools and high
schools, which is, one strike you're in trouble and two strikes
you're out,''' Bennett said.
   ``How can you as officers of the court, of the law, not hold to
these kinds of standards?'' Bennett said he told Raven.
   Bennett said he gave Sammons a similar speech: ``If you're
doctors and you're taking illegal drugs, you're being a lousy
example.''
   Both the ABA and the AMA _ voluntary organizations without power
to discipline members by lifting credentials _ have programs to help
impaired professionals. However, neither Raven nor Sammons indicated
he would advocate Bennett's two-strikes-you're-out policy.
   Instead, they espoused treatment for drug abusers and indicated
that people with such problems might shy away from seeking help if
they thought strict records were being kept.
   A key consideration in deciding whether intervention is called
for, said Raven, is whether a client is being neglected or
mishandled by a lawyer with a drug problem.
   ``In many states now, they have procedures where they can move in
and protect the client, and that's very important,'' he said. ``In
the old days, it just sort of drifted, clients got neglected.''
   At the same time, Raven said, ``You have to be a little sensitive
to what might happen to the clients if you get too heavy-handed.''
   The extent of drug abuse among professionals is unclear. Surveys
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse check whether respondents
are employed, but not what jobs they have.
   Dr. Douglas Talbott, who has a drug treatment facility in
Atlanta, says the addiction rate for all people _ for all
substances, including alcohol _ is about 10 percent, while the rate
for health professionals is 17 percent to 19 percent. Few of those
are addicted solely to alcohol, he said.
   Talbott, who said his center has treated more physicians than any
other facility, said his experience with other professions is less
extensive. But he estimated that addiction rates are ``greater than
the average in such professions as lawyers and judges, professional
athletes, people in the entertainment world, people in the media and
people in the armed services.''
   However, a survey by the Lawyers' Assistance Program in the state
of Washington in 1987 found that while 18 percent of the lawyers
there had alcohol abuse or dependency problems, only 3 percent had
such problems with drugs.
   Dr. Bryant Galusha of the Fort Worth-based Federation of State
Medical Boards, said at least 35 percent of the disciplinary actions
reported are related directly or peripherally to controlled
substances, with the vast majority involving a doctor's personal
drug abuse.
   In 1986, Galusha said, the federation was notified of a total of
2,302 disciplinary actions against physicians nationwide. Of those,
458 resulted in license revocations, 528 suspensions and 335
probations, he said.
   Bennett said he would like law firms and hospitals to conduct
drug testing if officials there think abuse problems might exist.
   ``We're going to advocate drug-testing anywhere when we get to
the strategy,'' Bennett said, referring to the congressionally
mandated national drug-control strategy that he must produce by
early September. ``I can't mandate it, but I can sure say it's a
good idea.''

Beverly Hills dog cologne at $6.95 a bottle and designer pet pajamas
for $13.95 a pair.
   Cats in need of a good drink after a tough day's lounging around

<HEAD>Americans Celebrate Fourth of July in North Korea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A group of Americans held a Fourth
of July picnic on a riverbank in North Korea on Tuesday, sipping
Japanese beer, singing a Woody Guthrie tune and reading the
Declaration of Independence.
   ``Our country was founded by a revolution,'' said James Badger, a
Boston musician and member of the Young Communists League. ``We
think it's important to celebrate Independence Day. I feel very
patriotic.''
   Badger led the group of about 50 young Americans in a lusty
rendition of the folk song ``This Land Is Your Land.'' Others who
gathered along the shaded Poton River read the Declaration of
Independence, drank Japanese beer, ate crackers and watermelon, and
played volleyball against some youths from Portugal.
   The Americans are in the isolated and rigidly communist nation
for the World Festival of Youth and Students, a political conclave
of 15,000 mostly leftist young people from 180 countries.
   The American group, about 90 in all, is making a rare visit to a
country that has no diplomatic relations with Washington and
constantly vilifies the United States for its role in the 1950-53
Korean War and its military presence in rival South Korea.
   ``You have to come to grips with the fact that this country was
leveled by U.S. bombs,'' said Christine Kelly, a leader of the
Student Action Union at Rutgers University.
   She said she carried the American flag into the stadium during
opening ceremonies Saturday, adding: ``I want to be proud of the
United States.''
   But she said she wept when she met a delegate from Nicaragua
``who had been crippled by American bullets'' in the war against the
U.S.-backed Contra resistance forces. ``It is painful.''
   Jim Cullen, from the Student Association of the State University
of New York in Albany, said the Fourth of July was ``an idea of what
we can be.'' The celebration, ``no matter how small or modest, is a
vision of a better America,'' he said.
   Michele Goodwin, student government leader at the University of
Wisconsin, disagreed, saying Independence Day was a time when blacks
``get to look at how double-handed and hypocritical'' American
society is.
   Miss Goodwin, who is black, said, ``America will never have
independence'' until hunger, poverty and sexism are eliminated.
   She said she had come to the party ``to analyze all of this.''
   Others said their discussions with Soviet, Cuban and Third World
youths, and their exposure to the highly disciplined North Korean
society, which is so diffferent from their own, had given them new
perspectives on the United States.
   ``A lot of us are thinking more of our own country and what it
stands for,'' said Lisa Bratton of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference in Atlanta.
   Victor Buines, 25, an immigrant from Honduras living in New York,
said he was determined to work for change from within the United
States.
   Buines, a representative from the National Catholic Student
Coalition who is waiting to receive his U.S. citizenship, said he
went to Fourth of July picnic to ``welcome my new country I'm
adopting as my fatherland.''

   Despite a limousine, a country home, a New

   Her family includes husband Karl Soderlund, eight children, a

   Police Sgt. Alexander Gomez may be great at
collaring bad guys, but when it came to concert promotion, even with
a star like Linda Ronstadt headlining the show, he needed a little
help.
   Gomez came up with the idea of staging a concert over the Fourth
of July weekend to raise money for a Police Department youth center
and got Miss Ronstadt to agree to perform.
   But three weeks before the show, only 3,000 of 30,000 tickets had
been sold. The newspapers got wind of the officer's imminent
humiliation.
   The response was overwhelming.
   ``People took chunks of 50, 100, 200, 500 tickets,'' Gomez said.
``They went to their organizations and started selling them.''
   The result was packed grandstands for both Saturday and Sunday
concerts. Gomez said the event raised about $150,000.

   While some capitalists are lining up to make money
in the Soviet Union, about 100 demonstrators rallied Tuesday during
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's visit to demand repayment on a
decades-old investment that didn't work out.
   Francois Bayle, vice president of an association of holders of
prerevolutionary Russian bonds, called on French leaders to press
Gorbachev to repay at least part of the lost money.
   ``Gorbachev Can Pay _ Gorbachev Should Pay,'' read one banner in
the crowd outside the Bourse, the Paris stock market.
   The association estimates that between 30,000 and 50,000 people
in France are holding bonds issued by Russia's czarist government.
The bonds are still listed on the stock exchange for about 75 cents
each, although since the 1917 revolution that brought the communists
to power there has been little prospect for repayment.
   Bayle said the association would accept repayment of a fraction
of the original face value of the bonds.

   Four Soviet human rights activists held a brief
protest at the French Embassy on Tuesday and appealed for the
release of a dissident journalist jailed in central Russia, one of
the demonstrators said.
   A letter asking for journalist Sergei Kuznetsov's release was
addressed to French President Francois Mitterrand, Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the European Parliament, according to
activist Tamara Grigoryants.
   She said the protest was timed to coincide with Gorbachev's
three-day visit to France and wanted to ``show that human rights
problems in the Soviet Union still exist.''
   The protesters held placards reading ``Freedom to Sergei
Kuznetsov, the victim of perestroika,'' she said.
   Kuznetsov, from Sverdlovsk, has been in jail since December,
charged with maliciously slandering the local KGB chief, according
to Victor Rezunkov of the independent journal Glasnost.
   About 200 people in Sverdlovsk protested Kuznetsov's imprisonment
on Monday.
   The Soviet Union released many political prisoners beginning in
1987, but human rights groups say dozens remain jailed for their
religious and political beliefs.

   As the third transit strike in three weeks
threatens London Wednesday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is
digging in for her biggest showdown with labor unions since she
crushed the miners' union four years ago.
   Facing a strike-plagued summer, Mrs. Thatcher is contemplating
banning strikes in essential services. And in a show of defiance
toward the railway and subway workers, her government is turning
sections of elegant London parks into parking lots on strike days.
   Subway, rail and bus workers called a one-day strike for
Wednesday. Commuters booked hotel rooms and taxis, companies hired
buses and Harrods postponed the first day of its grand summer sale
until Thursday.
   ``It is absolutely disgraceful that people in the transport
unions don't think about their fellow citizens,'' Mrs. Thatcher said
in a TV interview. ``They don't give a damn.''
   The 75,000-member railway union, which now paralyzes the
state-owned national network each week, and the 10,500 London subway
workers, are preparing for a long and costly fight.
   Jimmy Knapp, the gruff Glaswegian who leads the National Union of
Railwaymen, says the railmen will keep it up until Christmas, if
necessary.
   And he warns that banning strikes in essential services ``should
sound alarm bells ringing in every home in this country concerned
with democracy.''
   The transportation workers are spearheading a resurgence of union
militancy after a decade of defeats, falling membership and laws
curbing the unions' once-sweeping powers to call strikes.
   Mrs. Thatcher swept to power in May 1979 on a wave of anti-union
sentiment after a winter of public service strikes left garbage
piled in streets and the dead unburied.
   This year strikes have regularly shut passport offices and the
BBC. On Tuesday, a one-day strike closed all but emergency local
government services.
   Rail drivers are expected to ban overtime soon, adding to
commuter misery with hundreds of train cancelations, and a dock
strike also looms.
   Most of the strikes began over pay. But there are political
overtones and both sides seem to sense a watershed is coming.
   Arthur Scargill, a Marxist who led his National Union of
Mineworkers to defeat in a year-long strike against colliery
closures in 1984-85, hailed the strikes as ``massive resistance to
Thatcher's policies.''
   ``It is time we took a conscious and responsible decision to defy
unjust and oppressive laws,'' he told a union rally.
   The railway workers want a 10 percent pay increase. Management
wants to impose a 7 percent raise, which is less than inflation.
   Inflation has almost doubled in a year, to 8.3 percent, partly
because wage settlements are averaging 9.3 percent.
   Management is under attack for trying to break the strikes
through the courts, and for seeking to break up the national
bargaining system by negotiating separately with worker groups.
   Ending collective bargaining would weaken union power as a
prelude to the government's long-term aim of selling state-owned
British Rail to private enterprise.
   ``The rail union is a not a militant one but they're incensed by
what has happened,'' said Murray Hughes, deputy editor of the
Railways Gazette, an independent publication.
   Railworkers are now among the lowest paid industrial workers with
average earnings, including overtime, of $457 a week for drivers and
$316 for the rest. They want a 10 percent raise.
   ``The pressure is coming from workers who see their standards of
living and conditions under threat at a time of rising inflation,''
said Norman Willis, general secretary of the 9 million-member
national labor federation, the Trades Union Congress.
   With more than 3 million people using the railway or subway to
get to work, strike days are commuter nightmares. People walk, jog,
sit trapped in traffic jams or queue up for a handful of privately
run buses.
   The employers' Confederation of British Industry says 75 percent
of commuters are battling in, often hours late, but the costs in
lost business and staff time run into millions of dollars.
   Legislation banning strikes in essential services is expected to
reach Parliament this fall. Mrs. Thatcher's supporters reject the
argument that it is undemocratic, saying arrangements barring such
strikes already exist in France and West Germany.
   Graham Mather, director of the Institute of Economic Affairs, a
right-wing thinktank, says it should have been done years ago.
   ``It would have been easier to change the law when nothing was
happening,'' he said in an interview. ``But now it has to be done
against the clock.''

   A former court clerk and a one-time top aide of
the late Mayor Harold Washington were convicted of accepting $80,000
from an FBI informant posing as a businessman trying to buy his way
into city contracts.
   A federal jury deliberated about 16 hours over four days before
returning the verdict Monday against the last two defendants caught
in the FBI's Operation Incubator probe into corruption at City Hall.
   Twnety-four other public officials already were convicted in the
investigation in Chicago and New York City.
   Morgan Finley, 63, who served as chief administrator of the Cook
County court until November, was convicted on charges of
racketeering conspiracy, attempted extortion and interstate travel
to aid a racketeering scheme.
   Clarence McClain, 47, who served the late mayor briefly but
remained a close friend after leaving Washington's administration,
was convicted on charges of racketeering conspiracy, attempted
extortion, interstate travel to aid a racketeering scheme, tax fraud
and mail fraud.
   ``The message here is that people who get paid off have to pay
the price,'' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Shepard, one of
three federal prosecutors in the case.
   Finley was acquitted on three of the nine counts against him in
the original indictment. McClain was acquitted on five of 16 counts
against him.
   U.S. District Judge Ilana Rovner set sentencing for July 25.
Finley faces a maximum of 105 years in prison and $1.5 million in
fines. McClain faces a maximum of 145 years and $2.5 million.
   ``We gave it our best shot,'' said McClain's attorney, Phil
Parenti, adding that no decision had been made yet on whether to
appeal.
   But Finley's attorney, Louis Garippo, said his client would
appeal, citing ``pretrial rulings limiting exploration of the
motives of (FBI informant) Michael Raymond.''
   Raymond, a convicted swindler, was the central figure in the
undercover investigation. Operation Incubator netted 16 convictions
in Chicago and spawned a probe in New York City that led to 10
convictions, including that of Stanley M. Friedman, Democratic
chairman of the Bronx.
   Friedman and four co-defendants were found guilty in a scheme to
get a $22.7 million Parking Violations Bureau contract for hand-held
computers through a pattern of racketeering. He was sentenced to 12
years in prison.
   Raymond became an informant after being arrested in July 1984 in
Tennessee on weapons charges. He agreed to pose in Chicago as a
businessman trying to bribe his way into lucrative city contracts
for collecting overdue parking fines and water bills.
   He often wined and dined politicians in a posh lakefront
apartment as FBI agents taped the proceedings from next door.
   When the investigation was disclosed in December 1985, some of
the politicians and allies of Washington contended it was an attempt
to embarrass his administration.
   Many others criticized the government's use of an unsavory
character like Raymond as an informant.
   But prosecutor Ira Raphaelson defended the use of Raymond as ``a
method of getting behind the closed door where most public
corruption takes place.
   ``We did not use him as a witness,'' he added. ``We used him as a
microphone.''

<HEAD>Condition of Former Hungarian Leader Worsens</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The condition of former Communist Party
leader Janos Kadar has worsened, Hungarian radio said Tuesday, and
he was listed in critical condition at a Budapest hospital.
   Kadar, 77, was hospitalized Monday with pneumonia and severe
breathing and circulatory problems.
   He was visited Tuesday by party Chairman Reszo Nyers and party
General Secretary Karoly Grosz.
   Hospital sources said Kadar's wife, Maria, was constantly at her
husband's bedside.
   Hungarian radio gave no details of Kadar's condition. Other
state-run media ran only the same terse report.
   Kadar was stripped of his last Communist Party posts in May after
he was reported gravely ill.
   The party leader for 32 years, Kadar had been named honorary
party chairman in May 1988, when Grosz became general secretary. In
the past year, Kadar's political legacy has come increasingly into
question.
   After guiding Hungary to relative prosperity and tolerance by the
1970s, he was seen as an obstacle to political and economic reform
in the 1980s.
   He has not been seen in public since April, when participants at
a communist Central Committee meeting said he gave a long, rambling
speech.
   In recent interviews, Kadar was quoted as saying the fate of Imre
Nagy and other leaders of the 1956 Hungarian revolt was his
``personal tragedy.''
   Kadar came to power after Soviet troops and tanks crushed the
uprising, and Nagy and his associates were executed on charges of
high treason in 1958 after a Stalinist show trial.
   Nagy and other uprising leaders were honored as national martyrs
at a ceremony June 16 after what amounted to a political
rehabilitation of Nagy and a re-evaluation of the uprising.

   A former Housing and Urban Development
official says HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. ordered his staff
to override objections and approve a North Carolina apartment
project promoted by a former law partner, it was reported.
   Pierce, who served under President Reagan, told Congress on May
25 that he took no such actions.
   Former Federal Housing Commissioner Shirley McVay Wiseman said
Pierce played a major role in the rent subsidy program now under
investigation for alleged influence peddling by well-connected GOP
figures, the Los Angeles Times reported today.
   Records in Durham, N.C., show that Louis Kitchin, one of former
President Reagan's key operatives in the South, received $40,000 in
consulting fees for an $11 million project for converting a former
hosiery mill into HUD-subsidized apartments for the elderly.
   Charles B. Markham, the Republican mayor of Durham in 1985 and a
high-ranking official in the HUD under President Nixon, was one of
the project's chief backers. Markham had been one of Pierce's law
partners in New York during the 1960s, unidentified sources told the
Times.
   On Monday, The Wall Street Journal also reported that Pierce took
extraordinary steps on behalf of the project. The newspaper said
that there is no indication Markham had any financial interest in
the project.
   The long-stalled project was given a big boost after Pierce
intervened with a multimillion-dollar series of HUD grants and
subsidies, the Times said. City officials in Durham said the project
has helped revitalize a poor area.
   It had drawn opposition within HUD from critics who complained
that the project would cost the agency too much and that toxic waste
had been buried nearby.
   In congressional testimony on May 25, Pierce said he told HUD
officials to give ``careful consideration'' to housing
rehabilitation proposals by such Republicans as former Interior
Secretary James G. Watt. But Pierce insisted he left the final
decision on such projects up to Ms. Dean and two other top officials.
   However, Ms. Wiseman said she resigned from the HUD shortly after
refusing to obey orders from Pierce and his executive assistant,
Deborah Gore Dean, to approve funding for the project.
   ``I was directed to sign it twice, by Deborah Dean and by the
secretary,'' said Ms. Wiseman, who is now a Lexington, Ky.,
developer and president of the National Association of Home
Builders. ``The secretary called and ordered me to sign it, and I
said that I couldn't do that.''
   Ms. Dean refused through her lawyer, Joseph E. diGenova, to
discuss the Durham project.
   An unidentified confidant of Ms. Dean's told the Times that Ms.
Dean said she told Ms. Wiseman to sign the waivers for the project,
but insisted she was following orders from Pierce.
   The waivers were eventually signed by Ms. Wiseman's successor,
Janet Hale, now associate director of the White House Budget office.
She refused on Monday to discuss the case.
   Pierce did not respond to requests from the Times to discuss the
Durham project.
   A telephone call to Ms. Wiseman's home today went unanswered.
   The Wall Street Journal said that HUD's inspector general, acting
on an anonymous tip, began investigating the project before final
funding was approved and found no substantiation of charges of undue
influence.
   Meanwhile, a senior government official in Washington said
nursing homes ``will probably be next'' among federal housing
programs that have been targeted for sharp cutbacks in the
investigation of mismanagement at HUD.
   The department is reviewing an inspector general's audit of the
Retirement Service program and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp could make
decisions about the program as early as next week, the HUD official
said Monday.
   The Retirement Service program helps provide financing for
nursing homes and other housing for the elderly.
   Today's New York Times said HUD is considering overhaul or
termination of the program in the wake of an inspector general's
audit that found half of the 24 projects examined in the Midwest
were in default or financially troubled.
   Kemp has acted to suspend or terminate other department programs
in the wake of highly critical audits by the inspector general.
   ``Nursing homes will probably be next,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The newspaper also said the problems would leave the government
liable for hundreds of millions of dollars in mortgages on troubled
housing for the elderly. The official gave no estimate of possible
losses.
   Last week Kemp canceled a mortgage insurance program after an
audit found 25 of 58 projects financed through the program had
defaulted. The department estimated the outstanding debts would cost
the government $90 million.
   Other federal housing programs, including subsidies for
rehabilitation of housing for those with low and moderate incomes, a
coinsurance program and a program in which at least one private
escrow agent who handled sales of foreclosed property has admitted
stealing more than $5 million, are under investigation by Congress
and the Justice Department for mismanagement, political
influence-peddling and other abuses.

<HEAD>Tax Evasion Trial is Trying for Hotel Queen</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   All in all, Leona Helmsley's first week in court
was not a good one. She was heckled, she cried _ and her money and
her exacting standards as queen of a hotel empire made her an easy
target for ridicule in the press.
   It was reported that the billionaire slipped off her left pump
during jury selection, that she paid $1.57 for a tuna fish sandwich
and that she ate from a plastic plate in the courthouse cafeteria.
   In ads featuring Mrs. Helmsley as the uncompromising ``queen of
the Helmsley Hotels,'' she vows never to use plastic eating utensils.
   Jury selection for her federal tax evasion trial is expected to
be completed Wednesday morning, after which Assistant U.S. Attorney
James DeVita will outline his case against Mrs. Helmsley and two
former aides.
   Mrs. Helmsley, whose 69th birthday was Tuesday, is accused of
billing $4 million in personal expenses to the $5 billion hotel and
real estate empire she heads with her husband, Harry.
   Most of the money was spent to renovate their Greenwich, Conn.,
mansion, prosecutors say.
   She also is charged with shaking down contractors who did
business with the Helmsley organization.
   Potential jurors were asked to reveal their income, what they
think about rich people and whether they believe the hotel queen is
an ogre.
   Helmsley, 80, who was indicted in 1988 with his wife, was removed
from the trial after being ruled mentally incompetent because of a
series of strokes.
   During lunch in the courthouse last week, she was heckled by a
man who apparently had had too much to drink.
   ``You rich people. You all ought to go to jail. You're guilty!''
yelled the man. He was escorted out by security officers, and she
resumed her lunch.
   Later in the week, Mrs. Helmsley was overcome by emotion when her
lawyer, Gerald Feffer, asked that she be tried apart from Frank
Turco, a former senior officer for Helmsley Hotels.
   As Feffer charged that Turco had ``robbed her blind,'' Mrs.
Helmsley had tears streaming down her face. She wiped them away with
her hands until a judge's clerk brought her a handful of tissues.
   U.S. District Judge John Walker Jr., a cousin of President Bush,
denied the request for separate trials.
   Feffer has said an essential part of Mrs. Helmsley's defense will
be that Turco was involved in embezzlement and extortion without her
knowledge.

   Hundreds of radical students fought
riot police with rocks and firebombs Tuesday during rallies to
support a Seoul student who defied the government and attended a
youth festival in North Korea.
   Media reports Tuesday said national security agents plan to
question opposition leaders in connection with another unauthorized
trip to North Korea by a National Assembly member.
   The legislator, Suh Kyung-won of the main opposition Party for
Peace and Democracy, surrendered June 25, and authorities say he
will be charged with espionage in connection with the trip last year.
   South Korea forbids unauthorized trips to the communist nation
and says contact between the countries must be through official
channels.
   The visit by Suh has been of special concern to authorities
because he is a national legislator and because he and officials in
Pyongyang kept the trip secret for 10 months.
   Radical students opposed to the travel law yelled ``Abolish
national security laws!'' and ``Miss Im Suk-yong, you are brave and
wonderful!'' as they battled police at Seoul's Yonsei University.
The clash lasted more than an hour before students were dispersed by
police firing tear gas.
   Im Suk-young, a senior at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign
Studies, went to Pyongyang for the 13th World Festival of Youth and
Students, which ends Saturday.
   The government has said she will be arrested and charged with
national security violations when she returns.
   In the provincial city of Kwangju, about 500 students fought riot
police with rocks and firebombs at Chosun University, according to
Yonhap, the South Korean news agency.
   Yonhap said police used tear gas to disperse students who then
regrouped and staged street demonstrations in the downtown section.
   The radical National Council of Student Representatives announced
it had drafted an inter-Korea student communique that calls for a
``drastic reduction'' of military forces in North and South Korea
and the gradual withdrawal of U.S. troops and nuclear weapons from
the peninsula.
   Im Chong-suk, chairman of the organization, told a news
conference the draft was being sent to the North for approval and
signing by Miss Im.
   There are an estimated 1 million troops in North Korea and about
650,000 in South Korea. An additional 43,000 U.S. troops are
stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.
   Radical students, a small but vocal minority, say the U.S. troops
hinder reunification.
   Intelligence agents are investigating how Miss Im obtained a
passport and money for her trip and whether there is any connection
with her trip and that of Suh or the Rev. Moon Ik-hwan, who is on
trial for an unauthorized trip to North Korea in April.
   Moon is the brother of opposition legislator Moon Tong-hwan, who
reportedly faced questioning in connection with Suh's visit to North
Korea in August, 1988, during which he met with North Korean
President Kim Il Sung.
   The daily newspaper Dong-A Ilbo said authorities want to find out
if Moon helped plan Suh's trip.
   Eight other people have been arrested in Suh's case, mostly for
failing to report his trip to authorities. The crime is punishable
by a $3,000 fine and up to five years in prison.

<TEXT>
   China must take ``a whole series of actions'' to
restore confidence among Hong Kong residents after its brutal
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, Britain's foreign secretary
said Tuesday.
   ``I don't begin to say that there's any single action that any
Chinese leader could take that could wipe the slate clean or
anything like that,'' Sir Geoffrey Howe declared. ``It's going to be
a long business.''
   He urged the United States and other nations not to impose
further economic sanctions on China. Howe said that would seriously
damage the colony, which Britain has agreed to return to China in
1997.
   Howe commented at the end of a three-day visit, during which he
was criticized for Britain's refusal to grant the right of residence
in Britain to the colony's 5.7 million people.
   About 6,000 citizens marched through downtown Hong Kong to mark
one month since the army assault the night of June 3-4 on Tienanmen
Square, which was occupied by student demonstrators. They shouted:
``Down with communism! Down with the Communist Party!''
   Li Peng, the Chinese premier who ordered the crackdown, was
portrayed on posters as Dracula and Howe as a bumbling panda.
   Howe stood by the 1984 agreement, under which Britain agreed to
return the colony and China promised continued capitalism and a
``high degree of autonomy'' in Hong Kong under a ``one country, two
systems'' policy.
   On Tuesday, the foreign secretary said there was a ``huge gap of
broken confidence to be overcome.''
   Trust can be restored, he said, only by ``a whole series of
actions, rather than words'' from Beijing. Howe said Hong Kong
residents will watch closely how China treats its own people and
drafts a constitution for the territory.
   The depth of the confidence crisis was indicated by a poll
released Tuesday in which 54 percent of 1,000 residents questioned
expressed pessimism about the future.
   Results of the poll by Survey Research Hong Kong, conducted in
the last week of June, indicated slightly more than half the people
may emigrate. The figure rose to nearly two-thirds for professionals
and executives.
   Howe said, without giving details, that Britain would allow a
select group of Hong Kong residents to emigrate to Britain, speed
democratic reform and seek international support for the territory's
people.
   He said other countries could help the colony, which has
extensive economic links with China, by not imposing further
economic sanctions.
   ``Hong Kong would be gravely damaged if the United States, still
yet other countries, were to engage in economic sanctions,'' he said.
   The foreign secretary said he was certain the most secure way of
being able ``to re-establish contact of a sensible kind, with a
sensible leadership'' in Beijing was to retain the prospect of
economic relations with each other.

   The traditional oath in which Poland's
legislators once promised to do everything for its ``socialist
development'' became a relic of history Tuesday as deputies took a
new pledge to ``uphold the legal order.''
   The Council of State, Poland's collective presidency, passed a
decree Saturday authorizing the new oath and eliminating a reference
to building socialism, which the Solidarity-led opposition
considered unacceptable.
   Legislators elected in June to the Sejm, or parliament, and the
new Senate met Tuesday for the first time for the swearing-in
ceremonies.
   The opposition had no quarrel with the first part of the oath in
which legislators pledged to ``honestly and thoroughly fufill duties
toward the nation.''
   But many opposition members felt they would be unable to take an
oath which would have required them to do everything to ``strengthen
independence and sovereignty, for the successful socialist
development of the Polish People's Republic.''
   Zbigniew Rudnicki, a deputy from the communist-allied Democratic
Party, was named the senior-speaker of the Sejm. At Tuesday's
session, Rudnicki called the name of each deputy and asked them to
swear to work for Poland's good. All 460 members of the Sejm took
the oath.

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ranasinghe Premadasa on
Tuesday accused unspecified foreign intelligence agencies of
whipping up disturbances to try to subjugate Sri Lanka.
   ``They hire people from inside the administration and work
insidiously through them to wreck the administration,'' Premadasa
told a rally at Mahiyangana, 70 miles northeast of Colombo.
   ``In the past when a country wanted to conquer another it waged a
war. But today when a country wants to tame, suppress or enslave
another country, it resorts to different methods,'' he said,
according to a text released by the government.
   Premadasa did not identify the foreign agencies but appeared to
be referring to his country's northwestern neighbor, India.
   ``You know what happened in the north and east of Sri Lanka. From
where did our people get that help to attack our own people?'' he
asked.
   Sri Lanka had accused India of aiding and training rebels of the
Tamil minority who have been fighting for six years for an
independent nation. At least 9,000 people have been killed in the
rebellion, mostly dominant Sinhalese.
   India has denied the charges and in 1987 sponsored a peace accord
aimed at giving Tamils local autonomy.
   Under the plan, India deployed peacekeeping troops to supervise a
rebel surrender. But the soldiers soon became involved in a
guerrilla war with the dominant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
who reneged on the accord.
   Premadasa began peace talks with the Tamil Tigers in May and
asked India to withdraw its estimated 45,000 troops by July 29, the
second anniversary of the accord.
   But India rejected the request, saying a hasty withdrawal could
lead to even greater ethnic violence. The refusal has angered the
Sri Lankan government and opposition parties.
   Samuel Bandaranaike, president of the Sri Lanka Patriotic United
Progressive Front, suggested Colombo break diplomatic ties with New
Delhi.
   ``If India is not respecting the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Sri Lanka, then our front will be compelled to agitate
to sever diplomatic relations immediately,'' he said in an interview.
   Bandaranaike's powerful coalition is believed to be close to the
People's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese group bitterly
opposed to the Indian troop presence.
   Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said he is willing to
negotiate a timetable for a troop withdrawal with Sri Lankan
officials.
   Sinhalese extremists killed seven policemen Tuesday in three
separate attacks in the south of this island nation, a police
official said. The government blames the militants for at least
3,500 killings in two years.
   The extremists in 1987 launched a violent campaign against the
government, which they accuse of making too many concessions to the
Tamils, who comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
   Tamils say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of the population.

<HEAD>Liberal Democrats Face More Campaigning After Tokyo Loss</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ERIC TALMADGE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The governing Liberal Democrats, jolted by a major
loss in Tokyo city elections, begin a new campaign Wednesday for
national balloting that could further whittle away at their
political domination.
   Plagued by sex and influence-peddling scandals and public anger
over a new sales tax and relaxed import laws, the party Tuesday
tried to win rural support by opposing a cut in the price paid to
farmers for their rice.
   The 2.55 percent cut had been recommended by the government's
Rice Price Council.
   Sunday's vote for the Tokyo city legislature was considered a
barometer of how well the Liberal Democratic Party will fare in July
23 elections for 126 of the 252 seats in the upper house of the
Diet, or parliament.
   The Liberal Democratic Party has held a majority in the upper
house since the party was founded in 1955. It holds 139 of the
seats, including 66 of those at stake. The Socialists, who routed
the Liberal Democrats in the Tokyo vote, have said they will end
that majority.
   ``No doubt about it, they will lose their majority,'' said
political analyst Asao Yamaguchi. ``If the LDP holds even 45 of its
66 seats, then that will be a big win for them.''
   The Socialist Party holds 22 of the seats at stake, while the
Clean Government Party has 12 and the Communists eight. Minor
parties and independents hold the rest.
   On Sunday, the Liberal Democrats won just 43 of the 128 seats in
the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly, down from their previous 63. The
Socialists tripled their strength, from 12 to 36 seats, following a
campaign that focused on the scandals facing the past and present
prime minister, the sales tax, and other national issues.
   Shortly after Prime Minister Sousuke Uno took office last month,
reports appeared that he had kept paid mistresses. He denied doing
anything immoral.
   Uno replaced Naboru Takeshita, who resigned to take
responsibility for the so-called Recruit scandal, in which the
Recruit Co. publishing conglomerate allegedly traded political
donations and bargain-priced unlisted stock for political favors.
   While Takeshita was in office, parliament passed the 3 percent
tax.
   Uno blamed the tax for his party's defeat in Tokyo, where he did
not join the campaign. After the sex scandals surfaced, the Tokyo
Liberal Democrats asked him to stay away.
   On Tuesday, the mass-circulation newspaper Mainichi Shimbun
quoted sources close to Takeshita as saying Uno should ``announce
his resignation Wednesday, even if he stays in office until after
the upper house elections.''
   Earlier, representatives of several party factions, including two
former prime ministers, were reported to have agreed that Uno should
resign for the good of the party.
   Ryutaro Hashimoto, the Liberal Democratic Party's
secretary-general, described the outcome in Tokyo as a ``total
defeat'' and said: ``We must study it, and use it as a lesson as we
prepare for the national elections.''
   The party holds a comfortable majority in the more powerful lower
house, where elections do not have to be held before next year.
   But Socialist Party leader Takako Doi said Monday she hoped to
put an end to the Liberal Democratic majority in the upper house.
   Yamaguchi predicted the Liberal Democrats will suffer in rural
districts that have just one representative because of farmers'
anger over changes allowing more food products to be imported. Those
districts alone, he said, could cost the party 10 seats.

<HEAD>World Bank Sees Low Savings as Basic World Problem</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More saving by Americans and others is a key to
international prosperity, the World Bank said Tuesday in its annual
review of economic development.
   The World Bank is the largest source of aid for Third World
countries, lending over $21 billion in the past 12 months.
   ``The fundamental problem is a shortage of world saving,'' said
Stanley Fischer, one of the bank's vice presidents and its chief
economist.
   ``We focus very much in economics on the U.S. budget deficit, but
that's only one aspect of the shortage of world saving,'' he said.
   Because Americans do not save enough to meet the borrowing needs
of both government and business, the government has to borrow from
the savings of other countries to deal with the budget deficit. And
government demand for money helps keep interest rates high.
   Fischer went on to say that countries all over the world need to
encourage saving.
   The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
finds that of 19 major countries, citizens of Britain, Finland, the
Netherlands, Norway and Sweden saved less by percentage than
American households did last year. Japanese, West Germans, French,
Swiss, Belgians, Spaniards and Italians saved a lot more.
   Reducing interest rates may be the most important thing that rich
countries can do for the Third World, Fischer said.
   Fischer was presenting the World Bank's 1989 ``World Development
Report.''
   Millard F. Long, the American who led the team that prepared it,
compared the situation in the Third World with the savings and loan
crisis in this country.
   ``We found institution after institution which, we can say, were
technically insolvent, much as our savings and loans are in the
United States,'' he said.
   The measures needed in those countries are very similar to the
solution here, said. ``You have to decide how to allocate those
losses, and in most cases we see that it's not the deposit holder
being asked to pay losses but the taxpayer. As in the United States
a better system of controls has to be installed to make sure that
the mistakes of the past are avoided.''
   The report found 1988 a good year for high-income countries _
steady growth of production and low inflation for the sixth year in
a row. It said the conditions were favorable for expansion in the
Third World, too, in large part because of the stability and
expansion in the wealthier countries.
   But the Third World had an uneven year. Countries on the eastern
rim of the Pacific did well, ``but in Africa and Latin America
hundreds of millions of people have seen economic decline and
regression rather than growth and development,'' the report said.
   ``In some countries in Latin America real (income) is less than
it was a decade ago; in some African countries it was less than it
was 20 years ago.''

   A bomb exploded in a parked car Tuesday
as a state governor's limousine passed by, killing him and five
other people, police said. The interior minister said he suspected
drug traffickers in the attack.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing in
the headquarters of Colombia's cocaine cartel, the latest in scores
of attacks on government officials in the last five years.
   A parked car packed with dynamite blew up as Gov. Antonio Roldan
Betancur's bullet-proof car passed it near a sports stadium,
authorities said.
   Police said Roldan, governor of the state of Antioquia, was
killed as were two of his bodyguards, two pedestrians and a
councilman from the town of Itagui, who was passing by in another
car.
   Another bodyguard was hospitalized in critical condition, police
said in a statement.
   Interior Minister Raul Orejuela Bueno said in Bogota that he
suspected drug traffickers because they used a car bomb to try to
kill a senior security official a month ago in Bogota.
   That car bombing was an attempt to kill Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez,
the chief of Colombia's Administrative Security Department, the
security force in charge of national investigations.
   Seven persons were killed by that car bomb on May 30. Miguel Maza
was slightly injured.
   Medellin, a city of 2 million people, is the headquarters for
Colombia's biggest cocaine traffickers, who in the last five years
have killed an attorney general, a justice minister, 30 judges, two
newspaper editors and scores of policemen and other members of
government security forces.
   Before assuming office, Roldan was president of the Medillin
soccer team, Atletico Nacional, which was reportedly backed by drug
money.

<TEXT>
   A fire killed six children left alone at
home early Tuesday, and investigators said the deaths might have
been prevented had there been batteries in a smoke detector
apparently issued by the Fire Department.
   The six cousins _ two 9-year-olds, three 10-year-olds and a
14-year-old _ were found dead in three bedrooms and in the kitchen,
officials said.
   ``It's hard to say if they tried to get out,'' said Fire Capt.
Mike Brown.
   The blaze broke out in a front room about 3:30 a.m. at the
two-story frame house, and the home was engulfed in flames when
firefighters arrived, officials said.
   The cause of the fire was under investigation.
   Chuck Randall, a district manager at Louisville Gas &amp; Electric
Co., said the electricity had been disconnected for an undetermined
amount of time before the fire. Neighbors said the family had been
using candles for light.
   Maj. Dayle Fortney, chief arson investigator, said a smoke
detector without batteries was found on a mantle inside the home and
looked like the type given out by the Fire Department as part of a
fire-safety program four years ago.
   ``It's been my experience that if people have smoke detectors in
their house, they do what they are supposed to and people get out,''
he said.
   Brown said the department ``provided a smoke detector at that
residence in 1985 ... and also checked an existing detector.''
   The identities of the children were not immediately released.
   ``In my opinion, they were probably dead of smoke inhalation
before they burned,'' Fortney said.
   Fortney said one parent, apparently a woman who lived at the
home, arrived shortly after the fire began.
   ``She was in shock, running up and down the street screaming,''
he said.
   A neighbor, Teresa Smith, 31, said the mother rarely left her two
children alone. The four other children were cousins who visited
frequently, she said.

<HEAD>Afghanistan Says Guerrillas Planning Offensive on Kabul</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DILIP GANGULY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tanks and armored personnel carriers
roared through Kabul on Tuesday as the Afghan government said
guerrillas were planning a new offensive.
   The government called on the United Nations to stop the
``impending bloodbath.''
   The military vehicles moved at dawn in the Afghan capitial, and
witnesses said they saw soldiers digging in new positions in its
outskirts.
   In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar,
Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said the guerrillas were being aided in
their planned attack by U.S. and Pakistani army generals. He did not
elaborate.
   There was no immediate comment on the government's claims from
the Moslem guerillas based in Pakistan. There was no comment in
Washington because of the Independence Day holiday.
   ``In such dangerous situation that we are facing aggression and
intervention from abroad we have to make necessary arrangements to
repulse and defend our country,''' said the letter, the text of
which was released to reporters.
   Wakil said the guerrillas plan to launch their attacks in
mid-July. He said he got his information from Afghan intelliegence
sources.
   ``The grave consequences, which will include bloodshed, killings
and destruction, will be shouldered by the Pakistani militarists and
overseas designers of the attack,'' the letter said.
   Foreign military analysts said a conventional attack on Kabul, a
city of 2.25 million, was unlikely, but they did not rule out
attempts by the insurgents to mount large scale guerrilla attacks on
Kabul and other major cities.
   The U.S.- and Pakistani-supported Moslem guerrillas have been
battling for more than a decade to overthrow the pro-Soviet
government in Kabul.
   Wakil said Perez de Cuellar should inform the members of the U.N.
Security Council of the situation.
   ``It is quite serious, we are making necessary arrangements but
we would like the world to know of the plans of the opponents,''
said Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani. ``It is a new
onslaught against the republic of Afghanistan, but we are determined
to defend our homeland.''
   Marxists seized power in a coup in April 1978, and Soviet troops
intervened to support them in Deceber 1979.
   The Soviets completed their troop withdrawal from Afghanistan on
Feb. 15 Under a U.N.-sponsored agreement to bring peace in
Afghanistan.

   A priest who set up an unauthorized church for
black parishioners has been suspended by the Roman Catholic
archbishop of Washington, a church spokeswoman said today, but the
priest said he would continue to hold unauthorized services.
   Cardinal James A. Hickey suspended the Rev. George A. Stallings
Jr. after the priest celebrated an unsanctioned worship ceremony at
the District of Columbia's Law School chapel last Sunday, said
spokeswoman Eileen Marks.
   Stallings, who was notified of Hickey's decision by registered
letter on Monday, is forbidden to preach, celebrate Mass or any of
the Catholic Church's sacraments including baptism, weddings and
Holy Communion, Marks said.
   The cardinal was leaving channels open for any possible dialogue
with Stallings despite the suspension, she said. Hickey's letter
said the decision was made in part to help Stallings turn away from
a course of action that the cardinal said was ``destructive.''
   The letter called the service Stallings performed at his newly
created Imani Temple last Sunday ``a public act of disobedience,''
and said the establishment of the separate group was ``a step
towards separating yourself from the unity of the Catholic church,''
Marks said.
   But Stallings responded today: ``The cardinal has failed to deal
with racism in the Catholic Church and hasn't responded to issues I
have brought to his attention.''
   In an interview with radio station WHUR-FM at the private,
predominantly black Howard University in Washington, Stallings said
he will hold services every Sunday at the Imani Temple, now located
at Suitland High School in Suitland, Md.
   ``The suspension only affects my duties with the Roman Catholic
Church,'' he said.
   Stallings had said earlier that he created the new congregation
because the Roman Catholic Church is not responsive to the cultural
and spiritual needs of black parishioners.
   Sunday's ceremony was attended by about 500 people and included
traditional Catholic prayers and liturgy, along with elements
borrowed from African and Southern black revival traditions. Black
representatives of other faiths, including Baptists and Muslims,
attended to show support for Stallings' move.
   Stallings, who has been on a collision course with church
officials since announcing his separate parish last month, said
Sunday, ``The church can't throw me out, and even if they do throw
me out, I have my own opinion ... they have theirs.''
   Efforts to reach Stallings by telephone for comment were
unsuccessful.
   Church officials said they oppose Stallings' methods but not his
efforts to respond to the black community.
   ``This situation has more to do with the needs and expectations
of Father Stallings than with broader questions about the adequacy
of Catholic ministry within the black community,'' Hickey said.
   ``As Catholics, we look to the bishop for overall guidance on
when to establish a new parish,'' said the Rev. William Lori,
secretary to Hickey. ``We can't have a priest setting up a new
parish and saying, `Hey, we have a better product over here.'''

   Roman Catholic Cardinal James Hickey has
suspended the priest who established an unsanctioned
African-American Catholic congregation, a spokeswoman for the
Washington archdiocese said Tuesday.
   The Rev. George A. Stallings was notified by registered letter of
Hickey's decision, said spokeswoman Eileen Marks. Stallings is
forbidden to preach, celebrate Mass or administer any of the Roman
Catholic Church's sacraments including baptism, weddings or Holy

   ``The cardinal has failed to deal with racism in the Catholic

celebrating a formal worship ceremony at his Imani Temple, in the
chapel of a Washington law school, last Sunday.
   Marks said Hickey's letter called the service Stallings conducted

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Writers' Union has voted to reinstate
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the chronicler of Stalinist terror who was
kicked out of the organization in 1969 and exiled five years later,
a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Solzhenitsyn's rehabilitation will continue within a few days
when Novy Mir, the union's main journal, releases its July issue
containing the lecture he wrote after winning the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1970, an editor at the journal said.
   Solzhenitsyn was barred from traveling to Sweden to deliver the
lecture and it has not been published in the Soviet Union.
   Next month, Novy Mir will publish three chapters of
Solzhenitsyn's monumental history of the Soviet labor camp system,
``The Gulag Archipelago,'' said Vadim Borisov, the editor who
prepared the text for publication. Another literary journal in
Estonia also is planning to publish parts of the book.
   Despite the gradual rehabilitation of Solzhenitsyn, the Soviet
government, which forcibly exiled him to the West in 1974, has yet
to restore his citizenship. The writers' union urged the government
to take that step, according to Literaturnaya Gazeta, the weekly
newspaper of the union.
   The exile lives with his family in seclusion in Cavendish, Vt.
   Literaturnaya Gazeta reported Tuesday the 26-member secretariat
of the writers' union had voted to revoke its ``wrongful'' expulsion
of Solzhenitsyn on Dec. 5, 1969.
   Two members of the ruling Politburo, Vadim A. Medvedev and
Alexandra P. Biryukova, have opposed publication of Solzhenitsyn's
works, and it was not clear when he might be fully exonerated.
   ``The Gulag Archipelago'' chronicles life in Soviet labor camps.
Solzhenitsyn was freed from the camps after Josef Stalin's death in
1953.
   A literary journal in the Baltic republic of Estonia, also is
publishing three chapters of ``The Gulag Archipelago'' in its sixth
issue, to appear shortly, said an editor of the journal in Tallinn.
   The journal, Looming, has a circulation of 32,000, and is
publishing the excerpts in Estonian, a language little spoken
outside the tiny republic.
   The complete version of the book is being translated into
Estonian and is expected to be published by EestiRaanat publishers,
said the Looming editor. She said the publication was authorized by
Solzhenitsyn himself, and was not cleared by any Soviet authorities.
   Borisov, an editor in the prose section of Novy Mir, said ``The
Gulag Archipelago'' excerpts slated for publication in that journal
had not been censored by Soviet authorities, although he
acknowledged that discussion over which parts to use had been going
on ``for several years.''
   ``We don't have to go to anyone before we publish, but the
journal has to be taken to Glavlit for approval,'' he said. Glavlit,
the state agency which makes sure that state secrets are not
published, formerly played a much more agressive censorship role.
   Borisov said material selected for publication included portions
on Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state. Western editions
of ``The Gulag Archipelago'' say that Lenin started official
terrorism in the Soviet Union, still a controversial contention in
this country.
   Borisov said that Novy Mir would publish about one third of the
whole book. He said that Solzhenitsyn had refused to accept any
payment from Novy Mir for the publication.
   The article in Literaturnaya Gazeta did not mention when the
writers' union took its action, although union sources said the
decision was made at a meeting Friday.
   The works of Solzhenitsyn have not been published in his homeland
since Novy Mir carried his short novel ``One Day in the Life of Ivan
Denisovich'' in November 1962 during the cultural thaw under Nikita
S. Khrushchev. The thaw ended shortly thereafter, and Solzhenitsyn's
works were banned.

<HEAD>Court Finishes Hearing Testimony in Palme Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR MAX</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man accused of killing Prime
Minister Olof Palme refused to answer questions in court Tuesday,
ending testimony in the murder trial.
   ``It doesn't matter what I respond to your questions, so I will
not answer your questions,'' defendant Christer Pettersson told the
prosecutor.
   Pettersson, 42, repeated his denial that he killed Palme, the
socialist who dominated Swedish politics for more than a decade.
Palme was shot Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home from a movie in
downtown Stockholm with his wife, Lisbeth.
   The court cannot force a defendant to testify, so it adjourned
until Thursday.
   Then, Chief Prosecutor Anders Helin will sum up the case against
Pettersson, which relies heavily on the evidence of Mrs. Palme.
   Court officials said they will hear the defense summary Monday,
then retire to decide on a verdict, expected before the end of the
month.
   Mrs. Palme identified Pettersson as the man she saw just after
her husband fell to the street with a fatal bullet wound, though she
said she did not see him holding a gun.
   Pettersson, who has served a jail sentence for manslaughter and
is a known alcohol and drug abuser, also was seen in the area by
other witnesses who testified earlier in the monthlong trial.
   On Tuesday, the defense called an insurance company employee to
testify that Mrs. Palme appeared distraught and shocked immediately
after the shooting, implying her identification of Pettersson was
unreliable.
   Stig Engstrom, one of the first to rush over to Palme, appeared
to contradict Mrs. Palme's claim that she was collected enough to
remember seeing Pettersson, who she said was standing about five
yards away.
   Engstrom said Mrs. Palme was ``confused and disoriented.''
   Pettersson, who was arrested Dec. 14 after a three-year manhunt,
interrupted Helin when the prosecutor was about to question him for
the first time since the trial opened June 5.
   He denounced Helin's attempt to discredit defense witness Algot
Asell, who backed Pettersson's alibi that he was at a train station
17 miles outside Stockholm at the time of the shooting.
   ``I only have one witness on my side, whom you have done
everything to cast doubt on,'' he said. ``Imagine if you did an
investigation of every witness the way you did of the witness who
speaks in my favor.''
   Algot said he saw Pettersson at the station around the time of
the shooting, but he was unclear about the timing of his own
movements. Helin called Algot's estranged daughter to testify her
father's word was not to be trusted.
   As exhibits, the prosecutor has introduced a booklet and letter
found in Pettersson's home and described as containing anti-Palme
remarks.
   The letter was written to a friend on trial who was denied
permission to change his defense lawyer. Pettersson said in the
letter ``that's the way it goes in Palme's government.''
   The prosecution has tried to show Pettersson had a deep hatred of
all authority. Pettersson says he admired Palme personally.

   Strikers in Dhaka, the capital, damaged 10 vehicles and at least
30 strikers were injured in clashes with police, said Abdul
Mutallib, president of the Bangladesh Workers' Federation.
   In Mymensingh, 70 miles north of Dhaka, workers blocked rail
tracks and halted train traffic, said government official Nurul Huq.
   More than 20 trade unions backed by opposition political parties
joined in calling the 24-hour general strike. The unions represent
Bandladesh's 1.5 million industrial and railroad workers and demand
the government nearly double the minimum wage from the equivalent of
$25 a month to $44. They also want allowances pegged to the cost of
living and set at 60 percent of their wages.
   Most industrial workers are employed at textile, jute and carpet
manufacturing mills and factories.
   United News of Bangladesh news agency reported the strike
severely disrupted train, bus and ferry services all over the
country.
   Trade union leaders in Chittagong and Khulna ports, contacted by
telephone, said striking dock workers formed picket lines and halted
work there.
   In Dhaka, a normally bustling city of 4 million people, buses
stayed off the road and motorists did not venture out for fear of
violence.
   But the city's bicycle-rickshaws were out in force, transporting
commuters to offices. Rickshaws were exempted from the strike.
   Police officials said more than 200 youths were taken into
custody Monday night and early Tuesday. ``The boys have been picked
up on suspicion that they may carry out violence,'' a police
official said. ``They will be released after the strike is over.''

<HEAD>Charges Dismissed Against Cousins Accused of Killing Mustangs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge dismissed charges against two cousins
accused of killing five wild horses because the indictment didn't
specify which five horses the men allegedly shot.
   U.S. District Judge Edward C. Reed Jr. ordered the charges
against Eugene Thacker and Ronald Hage dropped Monday before the
case went to the jury.
   The charges described seven carcasses found in 1987 about 50
miles from Battle Mountain. The horses were decomposed and bullets
or bullet holes were found in only five carcasses.
   ``It would be easy to argue that somewhere in the seven horses
were the five horses they are charged with killing. As a matter of
fair play, I think the defendants, the court and the jury have a
right to know which horses,'' the judge said.
   Reed's dismissal left the door open to the filing of more
specific charges against the men. Assistant U.S. Attorney Will
Mattly said he may do so.
   Thacker, 27, a cowboy from Imlay, and Hage, 23, a miner from
Winnemucca, were indicted in January after Bureau of Land Management
agents found the carcasses of more than 500 wild horses scattered
over a wide area of federal land in north-central Nevada some 350
miles northeast of Reno.
   Many of the animals had been shot, although others may have died
of natural causes, officials said. Some of the animals may have been
dead for years. Wild horses roam the West under federal protection.
   Federal officials have never offered a motive for the killings of
wild horses, but theories have included resentment about wild horses
competing with livestock for grass, and the possibility that the
animals were targets of opportunity, like signs that get shot up
along rural roads.
   The BLM is continuing its investigation of the slayings, which
are believed to have occurred in the summer of 1987.
   The men were charged with misdemeanor violations of the federal
Wild and Free Roaming Horse and Burro Act. The charges carried up to
six months in jail and $1,000 fine each.
   There are an estimated 26,000 wild horses in Nevada, where the
federal government owns most of the land.

   Torrential rains triggered floods that
killed five people and inundated 650 homes near Zagreb, state
television reported Tuesday.
   The rain Monday night and early Tuesday was blamed for sweeping a
car off a road into a swollen river near Slovenska Bistrica, about
30 miles west of Zagreb, killing three people, the report said.
   A fisherman drowned near Slovenska Bistrica and a firefighter was
killed in Zagreb, it said.
   Firefighters and other rescue workers evacuated at least 100
people and provided other help to victims in the flood-stricken
area. Damage from the floods was ``enormous,'' according to the
Tanjug news agency.

   A young guard stopped the man with the
tousled hair and old blue jeans and asked for identification.
   But a superior quickly intervened, saying: ``Come in, Mr. Deputy.
No need for that.''
   That's how Adam Michnik, one of the country's most frequently
jailed dissidents, took his seat Tuesday in the Sejm among communist
deputies in the first East bloc legislature since the late 1940s to
have a real opposition.
   In a day redolent with ironies, 259 Solidarity-backed senators
and deputies sat down beside 300 communist coalition members, all
swearing the same oath ``to do everything for the well-being of the
motherland and the good of the citizens.''
   Gone was the reference contained in the old oath to do everything
``for the successful socialist development of the Polish People's
Republic.'' It had been agreed before the meeting that the
Solidarity representatives could not swear to uphold socialism.
   During the opening session of the Senate, Solidarity leader Lech
Walesa sat next to Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the man
who signed the martial-law order to crush Walesa's independent union
in 1981.
   They seemed to get on famously.
   In the dining room of the Sejm, Solidarity lawmakers broke bread
with members of the communist coalition. In the corridors, Walesa's
driver bantered with uniformed Sejm guards.
   Less than a year ago, Jerzy Urban, then the government spokesman,
said negotiations could not begin with Solidarity until Walesa
dropped the radicals Michnik and Jacek Kuron from his negotiating
team.
   On Tuesday, Michnik and Kuron were among the first to speak.
Kuron launched into a sharp attack on the economic performance of
the government of Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski. Shortly
after he finished, Rakowski left the building and Kuron remained
behind.
   ``It feels strange,'' said Solidarity Deputy Jan Litynski,
another veteran activist, after the session.
   Asked why, he referred to the the fact that legislators cannot be
prosecuted under Poland's constitution.
   ``At one point after I had been sworn in and Henryk (Wujec) had
not, he said to me, `Now you can't be arrested and I still can,'''
Litynski said with a laugh.

   World War II veteran John Grillo spent
the Fourth of July as he does every other day: in the company of
hundreds of American flags.
   Grillo, 78, collects and sells all kinds of flags from the
business he runs out of his home. But it was Old Glory he reveled in
Tuesday.
   ``My goodness, I think I have about 200 or 300; more than that,
if you count the grosses and grosses of 4-by-6-inch and 6-by-9-inch
flags,'' said Grillo.
   In honor of the holiday, he hung 24 flags in front of his home,
two in his garden and another across the street.
   ``As they ride by, they'll see it,'' said Grillo, although he
conceded that not too many people were driving through his quiet
section of Mount Vernon, just north of New York City, over the
holiday.
   Grillo, who did clerical work with the 8th Air Force in England
during World War II, sells flags to clubs, municipalities and
ordinary citizens _ offering veterans an extra-good deal.
   Although business picks up over the Fourth, he generally has a
hard time making ends meet.
   ``In the U.S., there must be 15 or 20 major manufacturers and a
fewer small ones. They don't gross in sales what a toy or doll
company would,'' said Grillo.
   ``But it doesn't make me bitter,'' he added. ``This is a work of
love.''
   The flag is ``our signature,'' he said. ``It's everything we came
from _ blood, sweat and tears. It reminds us of mother and dad and
our ancestors. It's a beacon that lights the night; darkness has
never put it out. It's wholesome and good and clean _ it's us.''
   When he thinks about the Supreme Court allowing the desecration
of the flag, he gets so mad he can barely get out the words.
   ``They should send these characters on their way and have them
blow their noses,'' he says _ although it's not clear whether he
means flag-burners or the Supreme Court justices.

<HEAD>Cuban Woman Officer Admits Smuggling Cocaine in Computers Into Florida</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A officer told a Cuban court-martial that she
hid cocaine inside computers and smuggled them in speedboats to
Florida, the official Cuban news agency said Tuesday.
   ``I allowed myself to be tempted, the damage is done and now I
have to pay,'' Prensa Latina quoted Capt. Rosa Maria Abierno as
saying.
   She said she used an unidentified ``commercial contact to start
the trafficking of drugs'' into Florida.
   Ms. Abierno said the operation was authorized by Col. Antonio de
la Guardia Font, an officer of a secret Interior Ministry division
that smuggled goods to circumvent a U.S. economic embargo, which was
declared in the 1960s on President Fidel Castro's government.
   ``With the operation authorized, we proceeded to ship the cocaine
camouflaged inside computers for a value of $300,000 into the United
States,'' Ms. Abierno was quoted as saying. She said she coordinated
three such operations.
   Cuba does not manufacture computers and the dispatch did not say
from where they originated.
   Ms. Abierno testified on her own behalf Monday night, shortly
before the court recessed in its third day of hearings in Havana.
She was the only woman among 15 people on trial for high treason,
smuggling and corruption.
   Those charged included Maj. Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, a hero of Cuban
military expeditions to civil wars in Angola and Ethiopia, and
former Interior Minister Jose Abrantes. All were stripped of rank
and decorations last week and dishonorably discharged by a military
court of honor, which recommended they be tried by court-martial.
   They face execution by firing squad if found guilty.
   The news agency dispatches, monitored in Mexico City, identified
Ms. Abierno as a ``very active coordinator'' from 1987 to 1989 in
drug trafficking.
   She bought a house and a car with her share from the smuggling
operations, Prensa Latina said. It said authorities confiscated
$14,000 in cash when they arrested her.
   Authorities confiscated $1.2 million, 39 luxury cars, a
motorcycle and 186 firearms when they arrested them, the dispatches
said.
   Under cross-examination by prosecutors on Sunday, Ochoa said he
took up drug smuggling to earn dollars to help Cuba's strained
economy.
   Among those on trial are de la Guardia's twin brother, Brig. Gen.
Patricio de la Guardia, and Capt. Miguel Ruiz, two of Ochoa's close
aides.
   Prensa Latina said testimony also accused the defendants of
allowing shiploads of contraband marijuana from Jamaica and hundreds
of pounds of cocaine to pass through Cuban territorial waters and
airspace into Florida. They are also accused of dealing in diamonds
and ivory.

<HEAD>Cohen Finds de Klerk `Reasonable,' Promises Changes in U.S. Policy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DURBAN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Herman Cohen, the new assistant U.S.
secretary of state for African affairs, said Tuesday he finds the
man designated to be South Africa's next ruler to be a ``very
reasonable person.''
   Cohen met for an hour with National Party leader F.W. de Klerk
before flying to Namibia and the Ivory Coast on his first African
tour since he succeeded Chester Crocker.
   He said he could not outline the Bush administration's policy
toward South Africa because it won't be formalized until September.
   ``I believe there will be significant differences (from the
Reagan administration) in our new policy,'' Cohen said.
   It ``does have new emphasis and the new emphasis is on helping
the non-white community to improve its conditions and its political
leverage for the inevitable negotiations which will take place.''
   Cohen said he was ``particularly impressed'' by de Klerk's
``desire to continue regional cooperation, regional detente. I was
very happy to hear that he would like to continue and expand on his
program for greater economic involvement with neighboring
countries.''
   The main reason for his Africa trip is to attend a monitoring
commission of the U.S.-brokered peace accord between Angola, Cuba
and South Africa.
   Cohen intends to return to South Africa July 10 to continue
discussions with a broad range of leaders, from conservatives to
banned black nationalists.
   In London, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday
she detects change in South Africa, but added she could not say when
black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela will be freed.
   ``I cannot tell when it (Mandela's freedom) will come about, but
I do believe that there is a change in South Africa,'' Mrs. Thatcher
told the House of Commons in answer to a legislator's question.
   She said Mandela has to be released before blacks and whites can
hold constitutional talks.
   Mandela was sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964 when he was
convicted of plotting to overthrow the government.
   Mrs. Thatcher said she hoped for ``movement toward negotiations''
after September general elections when South Africa's whites,
mixed-race and Indian voters will elect lawmakers of their racial
groups to the three segregated houses of Parliament. The black
majority has no vote.
   Also on Tuesday, attorney Clive Plasket said 128 blacks arrested
after a riot were released Tuesday and eight are being held in
connection with fighting that killed 11 people.
   The violence broke out Saturday when Bophuthatswana police broke
up what they called an illegal gathering at Leeuwfontein village,
150 miles northwest of Johannesburg. The meeting was to plan
strategy to stop the village being incorporated into Bophuthatswana,
a tribal homeland which South Africa calls an independent republic.
   Two civilians were killed when police fired at the crowd. Four
policemen were killed when a gasoline bomb hit their vehicle, and
five other officers were axed and stoned to death.
   Plasket said he saw the eight detainees, who have not been
charged.

   A Soviet jet fighter flew over three
NATO nations Tuesday _ after its pilot ejected over Poland _ and
crashed into a house near the French-Belgian border, killing an
18-year-old man inside.
   Officials of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization said U.S.
F-15s intercepted the MiG-23 soon after it entered NATO airspace and
accompanied it until it crashed. They said the Soviet plane was not
armed.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said the plane went astray after the
pilot ejected because of equipment failure ``during a training
flight over Poland.'' It said the pilot survived.
   Tass said the Soviet Defense Ministry was ``contacting
governments of the countries whose airspace was crossed by the
plane.'' The nations were West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium.
   In Brussels, Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens summoned the Soviet
ambassador to his office for further explanations, a spokesman for
Eyskens said.
   At the Defense Department in Washington, Air Force Maj. Mike
Stepp said the NATO air defense system picked up the MiG ``before it
ever crossed into NATO airspace,'' and the F-15s ``were scrambled
and intercepted the aircraft.''
   When the American pilots caught the Soviet plane, they saw ``it
had no canopy and no pilot,'' he said.
   West German government sources said in Bonn that Soviet officials
apparently gave NATO no warning that the plane was approaching, and
one questioned why Warsaw Pact defenses did not try to shoot it down.
   ``We would like to know whether the Soviets knew an aircraft was
about to go West and why they never made any attempt to bring it
down in their airspace,'' he said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   The plane flew over some of Western Europe's most densely
populated areas and went down only miles from a cluster of urban
areas along the border.
   Gaston Bourlet of the Belgian Defense Ministry said the MiG
crashed at 10:37 a.m. (4:37 a.m. EDT) into a house near Wevelgem, 50
miles west of Brussels, killing the young man.
   Firefighters fought the flames for more than an hour.
   Military officials in West Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium
said the MiG-23 arrived over West Germany at 9:42 a.m. and there was
no response to radio requests for identification. The U.S. Air Force
F-15s scrambled from Soesterberg Air Force base in the central
Netherlands and caught the intruder over northern West Germany.
   After crossing into northern Holland at 40,000 feet, the Soviet
fighter veered southward, lost speed and altitude, and crashed 55
minutes after it was detected on NATO radar screens, they said.
   Lt. Col. Michael R. Gannon, a spokesman at Supreme Headquarters
Allied Powers Europe near Casteau, Belgium, said NATO officials had
hoped the MiG would head out over the North Sea, where the F-15s
could shoot it down safely.
   Another official at the headquarters said privately the decision
was made not to attack over land because, ``when it is shot in the
air at high altitude, you don't know where it is going.''
   MiG-23s can fly at supersonic speeds and, within the Warsaw Pact,
are used only by the Soviet and East German air forces. The
aircraft, known in the West by its NATO code name Flogger, was first
shown in public at a Moscow air show July 9, 1967.
   Twelve versions of the MiG23 have been produced.

   Two leaders of China's pro-democracy movement
said in a statement from hiding Tuesday that they had formed a
coalition to reignite the fight for a freer China.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi and top intellectual dissident Yan
Jiaqi said the new organization would unite forces advocating
political change in China.
   ``The movement for democracy has flooded its banks like the
Yellow River,'' they said. ``It is unstoppable.
   ``Despite the unprecedented white terror, the Chinese student
movement and the movement for democracy are still alive. At present,
China is shrouded in silence, but that just means that a new and
bigger storm is brewing.''
   The Associated Press obtained a copy of the statement from Hong
Kong activists who helped smuggle the two dissidents out of China
last month. A videotape of Wu'er reading the statement and Yan
adding brief comments was shown on television in Hong Kong and
France, where the two are believed hiding.
   They said donations would fund what they referred to as a
``united committee for democratic movements,'' and they called on
``people who love freedom around the world'' to provide support.
   Students in China and Chinese living in foreign countries have
established dozens of organizations to promote democracy, causing
internal splits in the movement. Activists have said they hope Yan
and Wu'er can put an end to these feuds.
   ``The 1989 democracy movements is the most glorious page in
Chinese modern history,'' the statement said. ``The ideals of the
movement have shown the world that Chinese democracy will never
die.''
   ``We refuse to adopt terrorist methods under any conditions,''
the statement said, adding that Chinese revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung's adage that political power grows out of the barrel of a
gun ``cannot lead China to true freedom, liberty and democracy.''
   The dissidents proposed that the citizens killed during the June
3-4 military crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square be awarded the
Nobel Peace Prize. One student leader, Chai Ling, of Beijing Normal
University, has already been nominated by two members of the
Norweigian Parliament. Her whereabouts is unknown.
   The statement called on all Chinese to set aside Sept. 12, 100
days from the crackdown, as a day of remembrance for those who died.
It also set June 4 as a day of national mourning for China.
   Wu'er and Yan led two pro-democracy organizations, one for
students and the other for intellectuals. Chinese authorities
declared both organizations illegal, and the two are among China's
most wanted fugitives.
   The two men said they met with other dissidents from June 27 to
Monday to discuss the new organization. They did not say where the
meetings took place.
   ``The meeting unanimously decided that the June 4 massacre is not
the end of the 1989 Chinese democratic movement but rather it is the
beginning of a new consciousness of democracy in China,'' they said.
   The pair predicted the quick downfall of senior leader Deng
Xiaoping, Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun, the group of
hard-liners who ordered the crackdown.
   ``It won't take too long for a larger student movement and
movement for democracy to once again arise in China,'' they said.
``A reactionary regime that can only be maintained by tanks and
machine guns certainly will be smashed by this storm.''
   They said the assault on Tiananmen Square ``was not just a crime
against China's students and people, but also a challenge against
the basic principles of life and all humanity.''

   Premier Li Peng said Tuesday that China achieved
``great victories'' in quelling pro-democracy protests, and
officials blamed ousted Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang for
letting corruption get out of hand.
   Fighting corruption was a major demand of the student-led
protesters, whom Zhao supported. Thus, the government has blamed
Zhao not only for supporting the movement but also for indirectly
creating it by fostering the corruption that it attacked.
   Also on Tuesday, Americans quietly marked Independence Day at the
U.S. Embassy, where dissident Fang Lizhi is being protected, while
Chinese police with automatic weapons patrolled outside the compound.
   Chinese authorities said they were holding a journalist from
Taiwan accused of harboring one of the student leaders of the
pro-democracy movement.
   Two other protest leaders who escaped after the June 3-4 military
crackdown said in a statement that they had formed an organization
to carry on the fight for a freer China.
   In Hong Kong, thousands of people marched to protest the
crackdown and Britain's refusal to offer refuge to the colony's 5.8
million residents. Li was portrayed on posters as Count Dracula.
British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe was depicted as a
bumbling panda.
   The moderate Zhao, who opposed Li's hard-line approach to the
protests, was accused at a legislative meeting of fostering
corruption by maintaining it was inevitable.
   ``As Zhao advocated the view, the party relaxed its control on
corruption, which went rampant as a result,'' Yang Ligong, of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, was quoted as
telling congressional leaders.
   Zhao, who was a rival of Li, was stripped of all his posts last
month and accused by hard-liners of trying to ``split'' the party by
supporting the students.
   ``Yang suggested that this fallacy of Zhao's should be thoroughly
criticized and its evil influences be eliminated, while the party
and government should genuinely fight against corruption in order to
win the people's confidence,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.
   The agency quoted Li as saying, ``China has achieved great
victories in putting down the counterrevolutionary rebellion, and
the situation in Beijing and other parts of the country is stable.''
   ``China will certainly overcome the temporary difficulties at
present and do a better job in all fields,'' the hard-liner told a
delegation of Indian diplomats.
   Hotels and meeting halls throughout Beijing continued to sponsor
rallies and talent shows ``welcoming'' martial law troops and
praising soldiers who lost their lives during the crackdown.
   Official Chinese reports say about 300 people died in the
military assault, including many soldiers and police. Chinese
witnesses and Western intelligence reports say as many as 3,000
people may have been killed.
   About 1,900 people have been reported arrested, including
reporter Huang Teh-pei of the Taiwan Independence Morning Post.
Security officials Tuesday accused him of ``plotting with, hiding
and helping a fugitive under martial law.''
   He was arrested after meeting with Wang Dan, one of the student
protest leaders. There was no word on the whereabouts of Wang.
   Another reporter, Antonio Jiang of Taiwan's Journalist Weekly,
said he had been told by China's Ministry of State Security that
Huang would not be allowed an attorney.
   Two protest leaders who fled China appeared on French TV Tuesday
reading a statement that urged ``people who love freedom around the
world'' to support their cause.
   Student leader Wu'er Kaixi and intellectual Yan Jiaqi said in the
videotaped statement they were forming a ``United Committee of
Democratic Movements'' to bring together all Chinese seeking
democracy.
   There was no indication where the videotape was made, but Hong
Kong activists have said the two are in Paris. The statement was
also made available in writing in Hong Kong.
   About 6,000 people marched through the streets of Hong Kong,
carrying posters and shouting ``Down with Communism! Down with the
Communist Party!''
   Howe, the British foreign secretary, said China will have to take
``a whole series of actions'' to restore confidence in Hong Kong,
which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. He also urged the United
States and other nations to refrain from imposing further economic
sanctions on China, which he said would seriously damage the colony.
   The comments came at the end of a three-day fact-finding visit.
   In Beijing, American diplomats sang ``America the Beautiful'' and
held a brief flag ceremony inside the U.S. Embassy compound. Outside
the gates, Chinese police pointed submachine guns at bicyclists who

   Only embassy staff attended the ceremony, unlike past

   A week of heavy rain in eastern China has caused
flooding in three provinces and killed 47 people, official reports
said Tuesday.
   Thousands of homes collapsed and ``countless dams, canals, small
hydroelectric power stations and highways were destroyed,'' the
official Xinhua News Agency said.
   Most of the deaths occurred in Jiangxi province, where 32 people
were killed in flooding from rains that began June 27 and were
expected to continue for several more days. Some areas received
nearly 20 inches of rain, it said.
   Flooding also occurred in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces.

   The gluttonous grouper who ate his
high-priced tankmates at a pet shop had his first full day of
freedom in 18 months on Independence Day.
   A year and a half after being snatched from the Florida Keys, the
3{-foot, 35-pound fish was returned to the ocean with a net one mile
offshore Monday.
   Wearing scuba gear, Terry Haley patted his pet one last time.
Then Flazey _ short for fat and lazy _ meandered toward the ocean
floor 140 feet down.
   ``It was nice of him to hang around for a while,'' Haley said.
   Flazey made headlines in May when he ate tankmates worth $5,000
at an aquarium store in Lansing, Ill. Haley, the store owner,
complained that Flazey was eating up the profits.
   ``It'd be great to know where he is right now,'' Haley said after
giving Flazey his freedom. ``He's probably looking at the menu.''
   At the store, Haley fed the grouper 5 pounds of smelt every other
day. Flazey, however, snacked on expensive fish and tried to wolf
down a 2-foot nurse shark. In the end, Haley decided to return the
grouper to his natural home.
   Flazey, a brown spotted jewfish, a member of the grouper family,
was a foot long and weighed 3 pounds when he was caught.

   The five-star Boca Raton Hotel and
Club has been ordered to pay for a very bad shot someone made on the
golf course.
   The errant ball dented the hood of Arnold Massirman's Porsche.
   Massirman sued, and last week, Judge Howard Berman ordered the
hotel to pay the Boca Raton man's repair bill _ $356.65, plus $38.50
in court costs.
   The judge found that the club recognized the potential for flying
golf balls because it had built a fence along part of the course.
Had the club extended the fence to the driving range, the ball might
have been stopped instead of hitting Massirman's car while he was
driving on the street next to the golf course, the judge said.
   ``What right have they got to hit me with a golf ball?''
Massirman, a golfer with a handicap of 10, asked last month. ``The
nerve of these people. This is a five-star hotel that doesn't want
to pay $400 damages?''

   Solidarity claimed the spoils of its
election victories Tuesday when 259 of its parliament deputies and
senators took seats in the National Assembly beside the Communist
Party that once suppressed it.
   It was the first time since the late 1940s that an opposition
group was installed in a Soviet bloc legislature.
   ``There were two great moments in my life _ the August 1980
agreements and today,'' said union chief Lech Walesa, who had a
place of honor at the front of the parliament, or Sejm, for the
opening session. Sitting opposite him a few yards away was communist
leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski.
   At the opening of the Senate five hours later, Walesa and
Jaruzelski sat side-by-side at the front of the chamber and seemed
to joke with one another.
   Jaruzelski banned Solidarity in 1981 and held Walesa prisoner for
11 months, along with thousands of other Solidarity activists,
including many of the new senators and deputies. The union was
restored to legal status in April.
   Tuesday also saw the formal resignation of the government of
Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, criticized for its economic
performance that included soaring inflation and market shortages,
and behind-the-scene maneuverings over who will become president in
a legislative vote not expected before Thursday. Some Solidarity
sources suggested the vote could be later.
   The president is empowered to name a prime minister to form a new
government, a process expected to take place after the visit of
President Bush next week.
   Theoretically Rakowski could again be appointed prime minister.
In a televised talk Tuesday night, he defended his Cabinet's
performance since it was installed nine months ago and asked the
public to help the economy by working harder at their jobs.
   ``The hopes of some Poles have given way to disappointment,'' he
said. ``I understand this, although I don't accept it.''
   In the 460-member Sejm, 161 Solidarity members joined 299
communist coalition members in taking a revised oath of office that
no longer contains a reference to Poland's ``socialist development.''
   The Sejm had been divided 65 percent to 35 percent between the
coalition and Solidarity as a result of a government and oppposition
agreement reached in April.
   In the Senate, which was freely elected in parliamentary voting
June 4 and June 18, Solidarity senators claimed 98 of 100 seats. One
seat was won by a pro-communist businessman and one was vacant due
to the death of a Solidarity senator-elect.
   Sociologist Mikolaj Kozakiewicz of the communist-allied Peasant
Party was voted speaker of the Sejm. Law professor Andrzej
Stelmachowski, a Solidarity adviser close to Walesa, was chosen
Senate leader.
   ``We are starting the term of the Sejm which may pass into
history as a great one. It can fulfill the expectations of our
society,'' said Zbigniew Rudnicki, the senior Sejm member who
presided until the election of Kozakiewicz.
   ``One is obliged to state the truth in this solemn moment, that
the breakthrough ... we are experiencing is to a major extent the
work of the Solidarity,'' said 81-year-old Stanislaw Stomma, the
eldest senator, who opened the first meeting of a Polish senate
since before World War II. The old Senate was dissolved in the
communist takeover.
   In the Sejm, communist and Solidarity deputies cooperated in
electing three deputy speakers, one from the liberal wing of the
Communist Party, one from the communist-allied Democratic Party and
one from Solidarity itself.
   Sejm Deputy Adam Michnik, the first opposition member to speak in
either chamber, asked the Peasant Party to nominate a candidate for
speaker besides Kozakiewicz, ``so that our first election in our
Sejm could be an election and not just a vote again.''
   The Peasant Party declined and Kozakiewicz won easily. He
promised: ``I want to be speaker for the whole Sejm, and not any of
its parts.''
   With Rakowski and his Cabinet staring emotionlessly from the
gallery above, Kozakiewicz announced the prime minister had filed
the government's resignation, as tradition requires at the start of
a new legislative term.
   Solidarity Deputy Jacek Kuron, a two-decade opposition veteran
who spent nine years in prison for dissident activities, criticized
the government's performance, saying its ``chaotic policy caused
only social unrest.''
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula, a communist deputy,
responded with a defense of price increases that drew protests from
two more Solidarity deputies. Before the session ended, Rakowski
left his gallery seat and the building, followed by most of his
ministers.
   The swearing-in took place against the backdrop of an intense
political struggle over who will be elected president by the
lawmakers when the Sejm and Senate meet together as the National
Assembly.
   Jaruzelski said Friday he did not want the post and recommended
Interior Minister Gen. Czeslaw Kiszczak, but Jaruzelski was believed
to be reconsidering at the urging of some party members.
   ``I haven't taken a decision yet. In the proper time,''
Jaruzelski said Tuesday.
   The key issue appeared to be whether Jaruzelski would survive a
vote in the National Assembly, where the communist coalition has a
300-259 majority. Solidarity lawmakers so far have said they would
vote against him. It was uncertain how many votes Jaruzelski could
count on.
   State media continued to discuss Jaruzelski as the strongest
candidate for president and barely mentioned Kiszczak. There also
were rumors of a deal with Solidarity that could see Solidarity
given the prime minister's post in exchange for joining in the
election of Jaruzelski as president.
   In the new parliament, the ruling communist Polish United Workers
Party confronts the unprecedented situation of technically being a
minority, no longer able to dictate decisions to its two allied
parties, the Peasant Party and the Democratic Party.
   The communists hold 173 of the Sejm's 460 seats, with the
increasingly restive Peasants and Democrats having 76 and 27 seats
respectively and pro-government Catholic groups the rest in the
299-member communist coalition.
   The Sejm is the main lawmaking chamber. The Senate will supervise
its activities and have the right to veto any Sejm acts. The
president will control the army and foreign relations.

   Former President Ronald Reagan was hospitalized
in Arizona on Tuesday with an injury suffered while hunting in
Mexico, the Secret Service said.
   ``We understand he was on a horse in Sonora and apparently he was
injured,'' said Agent Allan Cramer, spokesman for the service.
   Reagan, 78, was taken to the base hospital at Fort Huachuca, near
Tucson, Cramer said.
   Sonora is a Mexican state just across the Arizona border.
   Cramer said his information came from agents with the former
president's protective detail. He did not know the nature of
Reagan's injury.
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, White House staff members vacationing
with President Bush said they had been informed Reagan suffered no
broken bones and was hospitalized simply for observation.
   ``There was a riding accident of some sort,'' said a senior White
House official who asked not to be identified.
   Bush was boating ``will be informed just as soon as he gets in.''

   The London-based International Planned Parenthood
Federation said Tuesday the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on
abortions will harm women around the world, but the Vatican said it
did not go far enough.
   ``When America sneezes, the rest of the world catches
pneumonia,'' said Dr. Halfdan Mahler, secretary-general of the
federation, which has member groups in 128 countries.
   He said the court's Monday ruling was ``out of step with recent
international trends, which have tended to recognize new grounds of
justification for abortion.''
   The court, while not reversing its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision
legalizing abortion, in a 5-4 ruling made it possible for state
governments to impose restraints and withhold funding for abortions.
   In a statement, Mahler said the ruling was ``bound to worsen the
plight of the millions of women around the world who annually die or
are permanently impaired from unwanted pregnancies, or from illegal
abortions.''
   The federation estimates that 30 million to 55 million induced
abortions occur worldwide annually, and perhaps half are performed
by unskilled people, mainly in the developing world, ``mostly in
settings where abortion is legally restricted.''
   But the Vatican newspaper said Tuesday the decision did not go
far enough because it did not outlaw abortion.
   ``The problem of the suppression of conceived life remains,''
headlined L'Osservatore Romano in a commentary on Monday's ruling.
   The article pointed to the ``importance and value'' of the
ruling, saying the decision ``rectified'' the 1973 ruling that a
woman's decision to have an abortion during the first three months
of pregnancy must be left to her and her doctor.
   In Canada, Justice Minister Doug Lewis said the U.S. Supreme
Court ruling mirrors what has quietly happened in Canada.
   ``If anything, this decision highlights what I have felt has been
a shift in the focus in Canada that hasn't really been noticed
yet,'' Lewis said. ``I think in Canada we are seeing a shift in the
importance of the issue from the federal level to the provincial
level.''
   In an editorial, The Times of London said: ``Yesterday's Supreme
Court decision... has ensured that the most divisive issue in U.S.
politics will also be the most dominant.
   ``In future, most educated, middle-class women will be able to
command an abortion just as they do now, by paying for private
treatment, by moving from restrictive states to free ones, or both.
The poor and the uneducated will find it harder, perhaps
impossible.''

   The Supreme Soviet voted Vladimir M. Kamentsev down
Tuesday in his second try for approval as director of foreign
economic policy, even though the rules were made easier after his
first rejection last week.
   Kamentsev, 61, was criticized for ``thoughtlessly permitting the
sale of raw materials and other national assets,'' said Tass, the
official news agency. He has been chairman of the Foreign Economic
Commission for 2{ years.
   Tass said the vote was 200 votes for Kamentsev, 172 against and
47 abstentions, short of the majority necessary for approval.
   Since the Supreme Soviet convened June 26, replacing the old
rubber-stamp parliament of the same name, members have questioned
most Cabinet nominees and criticized many.
   Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov withdrew the names of seven nominees
after unfavorable committee hearings.
   Ryzhkov told the Supreme Soviet on Tuesday he would offer another
candidate, but said he still thought highly of Kamentsev, Tass
reported.
   By the rules in effect Friday for the first vote, Kamentsev
needed the support of a majority of all 542 members of the Supreme
Soviet but got the votes of only 246.
   The rules were changed this week so a nominee needs only a
majority of the members voting, but Kamentsev still lost.
   According to the Tass report, several deputies questioned his
competence and his ability to make radical changes in foreign
economic policy. Kamentsev has been criticized for problems in
foreign trade during his tenure, and Tass said several deputies
accused him of lacking a coherent program.
   His commission was created in January 1987 as part of a
reorganization of foreign trade agencies under President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's economic reform program.
   Gorbachev has put increased emphasis on foreign trade in his
efforts to reform an economy plagued by shortages and poor quality
of consumer goods.
   Heated debate accompanied Nikolai A. Pugin's nomination to
continue as minister of automotive and agricultural machine
production, but he was confirmed.
   Tass said legislators accused the ministry of failing to produce
quality equipment for agriculture, one of the weakest sectors of the
Soviet economy. Pugin proposed ending the monopoly of major plants
producing agricultural machinery, and expanding and updating
production.
   The Supreme Soviet approved incumbent Konstantin Katushev as
minister of foreign economic relations with only 37 negative votes,
Tass said, and confirmed Ivan S. Silayev as deputy premier for
machine building, Apollon S. Systsov as aircraft industry minister
and Vitaly F. Konovalov as nuclear power minister.

   The army said Tuesday that five Arabs are
charged with involvement in a plot to kill Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir that reportedly is linked to Yasser Arafat's mainstream PLO
faction Fatah.
   In the occupied lands Tuesday, Israeli soldiers detained about
200 suspected leaders of the Palestinian uprising in a security
sweep in the West Bank and killed a 20-year-old Arab in the Gaza
Strip, the army said.
   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron meanwhile said the army has
adopted new rules of opening fire, allowing troops to shoot plastic
bullets at masked Palestinians, the military command reported.
   Tuesday's shooting death brings to 540 the number of Palestinians
killed since the uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip began in December 1987. Twenty-three Israelis
also have died.
   Arab doctors identified the slain man as Wahel Ismail Hurt.
   At least 19 Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
soldiers Tuesday in the Gaza Strip, Arab hospital officials said.
   The alleged assassination plot aimed at killing Shamir last year
during a campaign trip to the southern Israeli town of Rahat,
shortly before Israel's November election, an army spokesman said.
   It occurred before Arafat announced in December that he renounced
terrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.
   A military court in Gaza last week charged four Palestinians from
the strip with witholding information about the plot, weapons
possession and having contacts with Arafat's outlawed Fatah, the
spokesman said.
   A fifth man, Ahmad Abu Madiran, from Rahat, reportedly is charged
with selling guns to the Gazans. He is charged separately and held
in an Israeli jail because he is an Israeli citizen.
   The army spokesman, who is not identified under military rules,
said the plot seemed to be ``locally initiated.''
   But Maariv daily newspaper quoted charge sheets in the case as
alleging that Gaza resident Ahmad Mediem masterminded the
assassination plot in coordination with Fatah representatives in
Jordan.
   Charge sheets say Mediem asked Fayez Khur, 26, of Gaza, to help
him, Maariv said. It said two defendants, twin brothers Fuazi and
Mohammed Khur who are relatives of Fayez Khur, heard Mediem discuss
the plot but did not report it to Israeli authorities.
   Madiran, the Israeli citizen, went to Gaza at Mediem's request
and sold two revolvers and ammunition clips and 30 bullets to Fayez
Khur, who delivered them to two unidentified Fatah activists in
Gaza, according to Maariv.
   The newspaper said the weapons were sold in January 1988, at
least nine months before the alleged target date.
   It did not say how the plot was uncovered, and military spokesmen
refused to discuss details.
   Maariv said the four Gazans also are charged with killing two
Arabs suspected of collaborating with Israeli security forces.
   During pre-dawn raids in the occupied West Bank, troops detained
200 Palestinians suspected of belonging to underground ``popular
committees'' and ``strike forces,'' the army command said.
   Soldiers raided at least seven West Bank locations.
   Police said Tuesday the motive for the stabbing death of Israeli
historian Menachem Stern in Jerusalem two weeks ago apparently was
Palestinian nationalism. They said they will soon release sketches
of two Arab youths suspected in the slaying.
   Palestinians participating in stone-throwing protests or
underground activities often cover their faces with Arab keffiyeh
headdresses or makeshift masks.
   On Tuesday, a military spokesman quoted Shomron as telling a
parliamentary committee, ``It is permitted to detain masked people
in Gaza, according to the procedure of arresting suspicious people.''
   Under this procedure, soldiers can fire if a suspect ignores
repeated calls to stop _ first shooting in the air, then at the
legs, then at the body.
   Israel TV quoted Shomron as saying the new rules were designed to
protect Gazans threatened by the masked members of ``strike
forces,'' who physically attack laborers working in Israel and seize
their work permits.
   Left-wing legislators criticized the new regulations. They
``smell of an illegal order and should be revoked,'' said Yossi
Sarid of the Citizens Rights Movement. Others feared higher
Palestinian casualties, saying many non-violent Palestinians wore
masks as a nationalistic symbol.
   ``Today, being masked means being fashionable,'' said Arye Eliav
of the left-leaning Labor Party. ``Everybody is masked today.''

   A devout Moslem who cut his daughter's
throat because she decided to become a Jehovah's Witness was
convicted of murder Tuesday and sentenced to life in prison.
   A jury at Birmingham Crown Court found Abdul Malik, 56, guilty of
murdering his 16-year-old daughter, Pharbin, last November in front
of her mother and two younger sisters.
   Malik, who came to Britain from Bangladesh in 1952, had pleaded
innocent to murder. Defense lawyer Michael Wolkind, seeking a
manslaughter verdict, claimed Malik was provoked and blinded by his
faith.
   Prosecutor James Hunt said Malik's standing in the community,
where he was on the committee of his mosque, meant more to him than
his daughter's life. ``What he undoubtedly did was to sacrifice her
for his religion,'' Hunt declared.
   The defendant said in the two-day trial that he intended only to
frighten his daughter with the 12-inch kitchen knife, but his mind
``went out of control.''
   Pharbin had left the family home because of arguments over the
Jehovah's Witnesses and her Jamaican boyfriend, the jury was told,
but returned home the day before her death.
   Hazzava Malik, 15, testified that her mother pleaded with Pharbin
to recite a Moslem prayer to her father when he brandished the
knife, but she refused and told him she would go to more Jehovah's
Witnesses meetings.
   ``He grabbed her by the hair and pushed her to the floor,'' the
sister said. ``He pulled her hair back. She had a lot of hair. This
exposed her neck and he put the knife to it. He did that calmly.
   ``He said he would not let her go to meetings, but she said she
would. Then he cut her throat. He did it like he was sawing at the
same spot. My mother tried to stop him and got cut.''
   Pharbin, her jugular vein severed, managed to stagger into the
street. She died on the sidewalk.
   Hunt told the jury Malik had threatened several days earlier to
kill his daughter unless she returned to Islam.
   ``It was no sudden decision,'' the prosecutor said. ``She refused
his demands to acknowledge Allah, so he deliberately killed her as
he said he would.''

   Ecuador's ruling coalition formally split
and the minister for industry resigned in a political crisis sparked
by growing economic instability, officials said Tuesday.
   The Popular Democracy Party announced Monday it was withdrawing
its support from the government led by President Rodrigo Borja, who
took office in August.
   The party had signed an alliance with Borja's Democratic Left
Party when Borja took office, giving the ruling coalition a majority
in Congress.
   ``I resigned according to the resolution of my party,'' Juan Jose
Pons, the minister for industry and commerce said Tuesday. A second
Popular Democracy official, Juan Pablo Moncagatta, president of the
Housing Board, also resigned.
   Vladimiro Alvarez, who was chosen to lead the Popular Democracy
Party in May, had said the alliance with Borja's government damaged
the party's image. Ecuador, an oil-producing OPEC member nation, is
confronting its first severe economic crisis in two decades.
Inflation is at an annual rate of 84 percent.
   Alvarez said, however, his party will continue to support
government legislation before Congress. The Popular Democracy party
has seven congressmen, while the Democratic Left has 30, meaning
together they have a majority in the 71-member legislative body.
   Petroleum financed an economic boom that propelled a near-feudal
society into the 20th century in just two decades, created a
prosperous middle class and eased social tensions. But estimates are
that by the turn of the century the oil that brought affluence to a
poor nation will have run out.
   But even before the oil runs out, Ecuador is experiencing hard
times. Oil exports currently account for 50 percent of the nation's
income, down from 75 percent in the early 1980s. Low world oil
prices in 1986 and a major earthquake a year later that temporarily
halted oil exports plunged the country into a financial crisis.
   Borja, who began a four-year term in August 1988, has attempted
to resolve the economic problems by imposing unpopular austerity
measures.

   Acting like old political pros, Solidarity
deputies heaped scorn on the government's economic performance on
Tuesday at the opening of the first Parliament with independent
opposition in 40 years.
   The discussion came after the communist government formally
submitted its resignation to the Sejm, or parliament, which now
counts 161 Solidarity deputies among its 460 members following
June's partially democratic elections.
   In his first speech as a deputy, Solidarity veteran Jacek Kuron
took on Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, who looked on from a
balcony.
   Kuron, toughened by nine years in jail for opposition activities,
told the chamber that Solidarity deputies had been tracking
government policy with ``deep concern.''
   He said the government refrained from increasing prices during
the election campaign, but let loose a huge array of price rises
once communist authorities suffered a humiliating defeat and
Solidarity scored a triumph in the June vote.
   Poles commonly refer to their economy as a catastrophe. Consumers
face an inflation rate of 100 percent. Price increases in the last
two weeks raised the cost of sugar, cigarettes, alcohol, gasoline,
refrigerators and washing machines.
   The value of the dollar, Poland's most valued currency,
fluctuated wildly last week due to uncertainty over further price
rises. The rate stabilized after the government announced a
monthlong price and wage freeze as of July 1.
   Not resolved yet is whether Solidarity will enter a government
and take part of the responsiblity for seeking a way out of the
economic crisis.
   Kuron attacked the government for announcing increases not agreed
upon with trade unions and for failing to provide safeguards for
people on pensions and fixed incomes. ``Such a chaotic policy caused
only social unrest,'' he said.
   Deputy Prime Minister Ireneusz Sekula defended government policy.
He said government expenditures were running ahead of revenue and so
prices were raised on cigarettes and alcohol, since the government
earns tax revenue on those items.
   Solidarity deputy Ryszard Bugaj, a specialist on economic
affairs, found Sekula's explanation ``unacceptable.''
   Another Solidarity deputy, Ryszard Brzuzy of Belchatow, where a
large power plant was hit by a strike this year, called on the
government to present a detailed report on its activities before
resigning.
   The faltering economy is emerging as a major issue. Bad
investments based on Western credits have burdened Poland with a $38
billion foreign debt.
   Poles themselves keep at home billions of dollars more _ earned
abroad or sent by relatives _ because they don't trust
government-run banks.
   Solidarity and official economists agree that the task of the
next government, whether formed by Solidarity or the communist
coalition, will be to build confidence among Poles and foreign
creditors.
   Solidarity has been actively pursuing foreign credits since June
for specific investment projects as well as for buying consumer
products and foodstuffs to satisfy consumer demand while reforms are
being implemented.

   Mahn Win Maung, the last president of a
democratically elected Burmese government, died on Tuesday, a family
spokesman said. He was 73.
   A graduate of Rangoon University who served in various ministries
including mines, transport and communications after 1947, Mahn Win
Maung was appointed president of Prime Minister U Nu's government in
March 1957.
   He was imprisoned for five years after the military coup of Gen.
Ne Win in 1962 that ousted U Nu, and he spent his later years in
retirement.
   His death came after a long illness, the family statement said.
   Mahn Win Maung was a member of the Karen ethnic minority group.

<HEAD>Hot From Southwest To Northern Plains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Temperatures soared to record highs Tuesday on the northern
Plains, and rain dampened the Fourth of July across much of the East.
   A ridge of high pressure in the upper atmosphere helped push
temperatures upward from the Southwest to the northern Plains.
   Temperatures soared past 110 degrees in sections of the
California desert.
   Elsewhere, Fargo, N.D., hit a record 96 degrees; Jamestown, N.D.,
reached a record 97; and Williston, N.D., hit a record 100.
   In the East, thunderstorms were most numerous from the central
Gulf Coast to the Carolinas. Locally heavy rain also fell in
sections of the lower Great Lakes and mid-Atlantic Coast states.
   Heavy rain in the rugged Blue Ridge Mountains of western North
Carolina produced flash floods and hundreds of campers had to be
evacuated, with some requiring help to escape over rising streams.
   Thunderstorms produced tornadoes near the central Gulf Coast at
Gulf Shores, Ala., and about 8 miles west of Crestview, Fla., the
National Weather Service said.
   Heavier rain during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT including 1.61
inches at Charlotte, N.C.; 1.37 inches at at Fort Belvoir, Va.; and
1.26 inches at Pensacola, Fla.
   The rainfall during the past few months in the Southeast is a
reversal of a drought that affected many areas for several years. At
Jackson, Miss., the change from last year is quite sharp. Between
May 1 and July 4 last year, only 0.77 of an inch of rain fell;
during the same period this year, 16.70 inches of rain was recorded.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 59
degrees at Arcata, Calif., to 116 at Palm Springs, Calif. Tuesday's
low for the Lower 48 states was 28 degrees at Truckee and South Lake
Tahoe, Calif.
   The forecast for Wednesday called for scattered showers and
thunderstorms from the Gulf Coast states to the Tennessee and Ohio
valleys and the East Coast; showers and thunderstorms over sections
of Minnesota and the Dakotas; and isolated afteroon thunderstorms
over the Rockies and eastern Arizona.
   Highs only in the 60s and 70s were predicted over the Pacific
Northwest and along the California coast; mostly in the 80s from the
Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic Coast, with some 70s in the
Appalachians and lower 90s over Florida; in the 90s to near 100
degrees from the great Plains to lower elevations of the Rocky
Mountain states and westward to the interior valleys of California;
and between 105 and 120 degrees in the desert Southwest.

<UNK>New Ministers Take Over, Find Files Missing</UNK>
<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ministers of the new conservative-communist
governing coalition said Tuesday the outgoing government took with
it confidential files in a move that will hinder a promised cleanup
of its scandals.
   Conservative Tzannis Tzannetakis, who was sworn in on Sunday as
head of the coalition government, said not a single file remained in
former Premier Andreas Papandreou's office.
   He said in a radio interview that one of Papandreou's advisers
told him that ``when problems were solved we tore up the documents
and therefore there are no documents. We solved all problems.''
   The government of the conservative New Democracy party and the
communist Coalition of the Left and Progress was formed after no
party won an absolute majority in June 18 elections to the
300-member unicameral Parliament.
   The coalition government, expected to last about three months,
said its aim is to cleanse the scandal-ridden government.
   Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement finished second in
the elections, and failed to win a third term in office with only
125 parliamentary seats. New Democracy won 145 places and the
Coalition won 28. The remainder went to a small conservative party
and an independent party.
   A $200 million financial scandal allegedly involving ministers in
Papandreou's government and 70-year-old Papandreou's open affair
with a woman half his age while he was married contributed to his
downfall. He has been hospitalized with a heart and kidney condition.
   ``They took the state home with them,'' the independent daily
Ethnos said in an editorial. ``The theft of documents constitutes a
crime against the state and concerns not only the people but
Parliament and the judiciary, which will be assigned to the
cleanup.''
   The right-wing daily Eleftheros Typos said it had confidential
papers belonging to the Commerce Ministry. It said the documents
were found in a garbage can outside the home of former Commerce
Minister Yannos Papantoniou.
   New Justice Minster Fotis Kouvelis told reporters the cleanup
would be hampered by the lack of documents.
   ``The race for the cleanup has begun,'' he said, ``and the first
great obstacle is the lack of files.''
   Papapandreou's administration broke long-standing tradition when
outgoing ministers were not present to pass on their offices to
successors.
   The only Socialist official who maintained the custom was former
Defense Minister Yannis Haralambopoulos, who said, ``This particular
ministry could not afford a power vacuum for a single moment.''
   Also Tuesday, Athanasios Tsaldaris, a veteran lawmaker and member
of the conservative New Democracy party, was elected president of
the Parliament.
   The 68-year-old Tsaldaris has been a member of Parliament since
1963, except for a seven-year hiatus when a military dictatorship
ruled Greece.

   The National Education Association on Tuesday
adopted a resolution condemning state and federally mandated
``choice'' programs permitting parents to choose their children's
public schools, saying it damages quality education for all students.
   But the union is not opposing such plans if adopted by local
authorities on their own.
   The huge teachers' union, in its first policy statement on the
hot education issue, said it opposes wide requirements for such
programs and ``continues to support alternative programs in the
public schools for specific purposes.''
   The NEA also plans to establish criteria for evaluating choice
plans, according to a new-business item adopted Monday.
   Officials have said NEA supports magnet schools, alternative
schools and other options.
   The resolution approved Tuesday at the group's convention was
more stringent than several proposals on the table but less
restrictive than others in that it left a loophole for choice plans
adopted by district officials.
   Choice plans enable parents to pick their child's school.
President Bush has called the concept a cornerstone of education
reform, contending that competition will force all schools to
improve.
   However, the NEA and other groups say choice plans have the
potential to weaken and resegregate the schools left behind,
particularly plans that don't provide student transportation and
that reduce tax dollars to schools abandoned by students.
   Education Undersecretary Ted Sanders said through spokesman Tom
Lyon the vote was ``very disappointing. All students deserve access
to a quality education _ and choice will make that happen. But
apparently the NEA doesn't even understand the concept.
   ``The president and the secretary have called choice the
cornerstone for rebuilding American education. Parents want choice;
students need it _ now,'' Sanders said.
   In another development announced at the convention Tuesday,
school districts in four states will experiment with close teacher
involvement in fundamental changes.
   One example in the ``Learning Laboratories'' program: In Memphis,
Tenn., inner-city schools will be controlled by a council on which
teachers will outnumber administrators.
   In Westerly, R.I., a computer will link schools, parents and
local government.
   The other projects are in Chaska, Minn., and Marshalltown, Iowa.
   The 8,500 delegates at the NEA's Representative Assembly have
been voting on policies and resolutions since convening on Sunday.
Among those approved, the 2-million-member teacher union:
   _Will request television stations and newspapers to put the names
of states on their weather maps. This was proposed by the Montana
delegation in the interests of geographic literacy.
   _Will notify President Bush of its disappointment that he did not
accept an invitation to speak at its convention and will ask that he
meet with the group's newly elected leaders to discuss ``the future
of our nation's children.''
   _Joined many other education groups in condemning Channel One, a
TV news program with commercials that is designed for classroom use.
The group called it ``an attempt to gain control of students for
commercial purposes in exchange for free equipment'' such as VCRs
for schools.
   _Will draft a blueprint for an aggressive 1990-91 campaign to win
higher salaries for teachers. The plan is to include TV spots,
``dramatic press conferences'' and newspaper and magazine articles
``focusing on the dedication of public school employees and the need
to reward them with professional pay.''
   The union contends that reforms made without teacher input are
destined to fail. The ``Learning Laboratories'' program is designed
to promote site-based decision-making with teachers as major players.
   To qualify as Learning Labs, NEA affiliates in each of the
participating districts have had to demonstrate that their local
school board and superintendent are committed to district-wide
change.
   The initial Learning Lab experiments are expected to last at
least five years each. The NEA has set aside $280,000 for the
project this year; the money will go for technical support and
$5,000 grants to each district. The districts are in:
   _Memphis, which is closing inner-city schools and reopening them
as democratically controlled school communities each governed by a
council of three teachers, two administrators, two parents and one
local resident.
   _Chaska, Minn., which has created a review panel that gives
grants to teachers for innovative approaches to learning _ including
one experiment in which three teachers have been elected to be
principals of their elementary schools while continuing to teach.
   _Marshalltown, Iowa, which is eliminating central office
decision-making on instruction and designating teachers to create
teacher teams responsible for decisions on key curriculum and
resource issues.
   _Westerly, R.I., which is using computers to link schools to
parents, the town government and educational resources in the school
district.
   The union also passed a resolution saying that it is ``deeply
concerned'' about Boston University's takeover of the Chelsea,
Mass., school system and said state and local governments should
provide the help needed to deal with systems like Chelsea's.
   The union also approved a series of recommendations to the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a panel which is
developing standards for voluntary teacher certification.
   Among other things, NEA is demanding that the board not seek a
link between certification and compensation, and offer only one kind
of certificate.

   Flash floods forced hundreds of Fourth of July campers out of the
Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina, and some had to be ferried
across swollen streams by kayak after more than a week of heavy rain
across the South.
   Hundreds more were still out of their homes elsewhere because of
flooding caused by the remnants of Tropical Storm Allison.
   The death toll since Allison sloshed ashore in Texas a week rose
to 13 _ one in North Carolina, five in Mississippi, four in Texas
and three in Louisiana.
   At least 700 Louisiana homes have been flooded, and some 500
people remained flooded out of their homes in Liberty County, Texas,
authorities said.
   Campers were evacuated from three steeply mountainous counties of
western North Carolina. One woman drowned when her tent was washed
away, but her husband was rescued. Divers searched for the body and
those of possible other victims.
   Several agencies and volunteers used kayaks to take campers
across rapidly rising streams.
   ``I think it's the worst it's been here since the flood of
1940,'' said Tom Huskins Jr., general manager of Grandfather
Mountain near Linville. ``And it's still falling hard.''
   Water from Land Harbor Lake flowed over the top of an earthen
dam, raising fears of a dam break. Campgrounds below the dam were
flooded and were evacuated.
   State engineers said later in the day that the dam on the small
lake appeared to be safe ``at least for the time being, if the rain
stops soon,'' said Jack Hughes, emergency management coordinator for
Avery county. However, while the rain slackened Tuesday afternoon,
showers were expected to continue through Wednesday. Hughes said
emergency personnel were told to stay near their radios through the
night.
   The remnants of Allison had dumped more than 1.5 inches of rain
on the mountains since Monday, causing some mud slides. The National
Weather Service said up to 2 inches of rain were likely, with up to
4 inches in some areas.
   Most July Fourth activities had been canceled in the mountains,
which were jammed with campers despite the weather.
   In the nearby western tip of South Carolina, up to 10 inches of
rain had fallen in 24 hours, closing some roads.
   The rain was caused by tropical air lingering over the Tennessee
Valley area, ``outside of the normal weather train,'' making
forecasting difficult, said National Weather Service meteorologist
Tom Thorpe in Columbia, S.C. He said his best guess was that it
would stay in the area for least another day.
   Farther back along Allison's disorganized track, more rain fell
Tuesday on Mississippi, where some cotton and soybean crops have
been ruined and two counties were declared disaster areas.
   Some lakes and streams continued to rise, but residents forced
from more than 200 homes over the weekend were able to return and
begin cleaning up.
   Much of central Louisiana remained under water after a week of
thunderstorms. Northern and central Louisiana got up to 25 inches of
rain last week.
   The water was still rising in places.
   ``It's still coming up 18 to 20 inches a day,'' farmer Richard
Daigre said of Bayou Rigolette, the only outlet for a lake that was
more than 12 feet above flood stage. His recently planted fields
were under water.
   In Texas, low-lying areas along the Trinity River remained under
water Tuesday. The town of Dayton Lakes was was accessible by boat
only.
   In Dallas, about 12,000 customers were still without electricity
after a storm containing 90 mph wind knocked down utility poles
Sunday.

   A federal Cabinet minister driving a motorcycle in
zig-zag fashion early Tuesday suffered a concussion when he crashed
while being pursued by a police car, police reported.
   They said Consumer and Corporate Affairs Minister Bernard
Valcourt, 37, an avid biker who likes to wear black leather and tour
his native New Brunswick province on his 1,000-cubic centimeter
Yamaha, hit a curb and piled head first into a wooden fence.
   ``His life at the moment is not in danger,'' Dr. Jacques
Francoeur, the neurosurgeon treating Valcourt at l'Enfant-Jesus
Hospital in Quebec, said.
   Delbert Pelletier, deputy police chief of Edmunton, said Valcourt
was driving his motorcycle there when police tried to pull him over.
   ``The police cruiser was ordered to check the driver of the
motorcycle moving from side to side across the lane,'' Pelletier
said.
   ``When the cruiser turned on its lights, he accelerated away from
them, turned onto a boulevard and lost control.''
   Francoeur said Valcourt lost consciousness on impact and suffered
a slight to moderate concussion and broken facial bones. He had to
be heavily sedated during the trip to Quebec aboard a Quebec
government plane equipped with ambulance services.
   But he told reporters that Valcourt, father of two girls, was
able to squeeze doctors' hands when asked to do so shortly after
being admitted to hospital at about 6.30 a.m.
   ``Tests indicate that there is no particular damage to the
brain,'' the doctor said.
   ``He's under medical observation and there should be a definite
improvement in 24 to 48 hours.''
   L'Enfant-Jesus handles major neurological cases from northwestern
New Brunswick.
   Valcourt, a lawyer and a native of St. Quentin, near Edmundston,
was elected to the House of Commons in 1984 in the
Madawaska-Victoria constituency and kept the seat after a tight race
in last November's election.
   He was a parliamentary secretary and minister of state for small
business and tourism before being named consumer and corporate
affairs minister in January.
   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney described Valcourt as ``one of the
most impressive young politicians I've ever run into'' upon being
informed of the accident. ``He's someone for whom I have great hopes
for the future.''

   President Bush observed Independence
Day on Tuesday by cleaning up clutter from the night before when he
treated friends to a fireworks display.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush wanted a
quiet day at his six-acre oceanside compound with members of his
family. No outings into town or to the local golf course were
planned.
   Bush did receive a morning phone call from Indian Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi. A White House statement said Gandhi called to wish the
president a happy Independence Day.
   Gandhi ``said the Fourth of July is an important day for all
democracies and said the U.S. founding fathers had a great impact on
the Indian constitution,'' the statement said.
   It also said that on Monday, between sporting events and
fireworks, Bush placed two phone calls to foreign leaders.
   He called Turkish Premier Turgut Ozal to express ``his concern
about the maltreatment and forced expulsion of the Turkish ethnic
minorities from Bulgaria,'' the statement said.
   He also called King Hassan, of Morocco, to wish him an early
happy birthday. Hassan will be 60 next week, ``and since the
president will be traveling at that time, he wanted to call to
express his best wishes,'' the White House statement said.
   Bush also told Hassan that retiring Adm. William Crowe, chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would represent the United States at
festivities marking the king's birthday.
   ``During the course of this call, the president also expressed
his support for the Arab League's efforts to resolve the situation
in Lebanon,'' the statement said.
   Bush and his wife Barbara began the day by ``cleaning up the
debris from the fireworks last night, raking and bagging,'' the
White House said.
   The president played host for a 15-minute fireworks display from
his compound. Thousands of residents and visitors watched either
from the shoreline or from hundreds of boats off the coast. The
White House said the $20,000 cost for the fireworks was paid by an
anonymous donor.

<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who seeks a
new revolution at home, visited the site Tuesday where a mob stormed
the Bastille 200 years ago in the uprising that swept away the
French monarchy.
   He began a three-day visit to France by joining President
Francois Mitterrand for lunch, a first round of talks and a
demonstration of Europe's new high-definition television.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, then went to the Place de la
Bastille, where they shook hands with Parisians and tourists at the
scene of the assault on the infamous prison July 14, 1789.
   Thousands of people crowded up to barricades placed around the
spacious square, many shouting, ``Gorby! Gorby!'' as did crowds on
his visit to West Germany last month.
   Reporters surrounded the Soviet leader at the steps of the new
Opera building, to be inaugurated next week in the presence of
President Bush and other Western leaders as a high point of
celebrations marking the revolution's bicentennial.
   Unable to reach more than a few well-wishers, the Gorbachevs
climbed back into their Soviet-made Zil limousine. On the other side
of the square, however, they climbed out again.
   Dr. Jean-Pierre Mach, a Parisian cancer researcher, said he came
to see Gorbachev ``out of admiration.''
   ``No matter what happens, he will be remembered by history as an
exceptional man, a man who has transformed hate to trust.''
   Gorbachev has described his economic and social reform program _
called perestroika, or restructuring _ as ``a revolution without the
bullets.''
   In a dinner toast Tuesday night, Gorbachev said the Soviets
``feel like full participants in your festivities,'' in part
``because perestroika, also, is a revolution.''
   He said Europe had a chance to move beyond divisions that
resulted from World War II.
   ``The postwar period is over. Today a way toward a stable peace
is opening before us, based not on a balance of forces, but on a
balance of real and correctly understood interests. Europe holds
this chance in its hands.''
   Mitterrand said problems remained to be solved before the Soviet
leader's idea of a ``common European home'' could be made real.
   ``Between the two halves of Europe, there are still many
obstacles to clear away, distrust to dissipate, barriers to knock
down before the inhabitants of the future home can feel at ease and
confident there,'' he said.
   For the French revolutionaries in 1789, the Bastille was both a
hated symbol of oppression and a military garrison where they hoped
to find guns and ammunition for defense against an expected attack
by the troops of King Louis XVI.
   They found only seven prisoners and a small stock of weapons, but
the day went into history as the most memorable of the long and
confused revolution.
   Marxist-Leninist doctrine sees the French revolution as a
landmark in the international class struggle, along with the 1917
Bolshevik Revolution that overthrew the czar.
   Although Gorbachev found a warm welcome at the Bastille, more
than 100 people gathered at the Paris stock exchange to demand that
the Soviet government redeem Russian government bonds issued before
the revlution.
   At the Soviet Embassy, about 2,000 Armenian emigres demanded a
meeting with Gorbachev to discuss the grievances of their countrymen
back home.
   The Gorbachevs descended smiling from their Ilyushin-62 jetliner
at Orly airport, where they were greeted by Mitterrand and his wife,
Danielle.
   In their first discussions, which lasted an hour, the two men
spoke of East-West relations, Gorbachev's reforms and conflicts in
the Middle East, Mitterrand spokesman Hubert Vedrine told a joint
news briefing.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Soviet spokesman, said they might issue
a joint statement appealing for peace in Lebanon and expressing
support for Arab League efforts to end the country's long civil war.
   He said the two countries were discussing an arrangement under
which more natural gas would be sold to France, with the proceeds
used to buy French consumer goods to relieve chronic shortages in
the Soviet Union.
   After lunch, Mitterrand showed Gorbachev the high-definition TV
system intended to compete with U.S. and Japanese versions.
   High-definition TV images are being broadcast as a demonstration
from France's TDF-1 satellite, and Mitterrand is eager to sell the
Soviets on the European system.
   In a separate meeting, foreign ministers Roland Dumas and Eduard
A. Shevardnadze signed agreements to fight drugs, ease access to
public archives, prevent incidents at sea and promote youth exchange
programs.

   Scofflaws are facing a new crime
fighter that can't be sweet-talked out of a ticket.
   With AutoCite, a new computerized citation system the size of a
calculator, an officer types in the make, model and license number
of an illegally parked car and the device records the data and spits
out a ticket _ all in less than 30 seconds.
   ``It cuts down the amount of paper work. The error factor goes
down to nearly nothing. We should be able to issue citations
faster,'' Police Chief Neil Purcell said.
   ``Beware. We're Robocops now,'' Officer Marianne Weber said
Monday as she put a machine-issued ticket on a windshield.
   The six machines, which cost about $5,000 each, went into service
last month and are expected to bring in $140,000 more in
parking-ticket revenue this year.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nazi collaborator Jean Leguay, charged with
committing crimes against humanity, has died in a Paris hospital,
his lawyer said Tuesday. He was 79.
   Leguay died Saturday after a year-long battle with liver cancer,
his lawyer, Yves Jaffre said.
   Leguay was a senior police official in the Vichy government,
which collaborated with the Nazis during their World War II
occupation of France. He faced two charges for aiding in the
deportation of French Jews but neither came to trial.
   In 1979, he was charged for his role in the July 1942 roundup of
12,884 Jews _ including 4,051 children _ who were gathered in a
Paris cycling stadium, the Velodrome d'Hiver, and deported to Nazi
death camps.
   The second set of charges, filed in 1986, involved the
deportation of 444 Jews from Paris in August 1942.
   Leguay was deputy police chief in the occupied zone at the time
of the deportations.
   When he was charged in 1979, Leguay issued a statement saying he
``never had any concern from 1940 to 1944 other than protecting the
French from their occupants.'' He was detained briefly in that year
then released pending trial.
   Serge Klarsfeld, the French lawyer who led the effort to bring
criminal charges against Leguay, described him as ``a political
police officer charged with negotiations with the Germans.''
Klarsfeld accused Leguay of persuading the Germans to include Jewish
children as well as adults in the roundups.
   Lawyer Jaffre said Leguay ``did nothing but obey the orders of
the Interior Secretary at the time.'' That the investigation
``dragged on for 10 years clearly proved there was nothing in the
dossier,'' he said.
   Under French law, there is no time limit on prosecutions for
crimes against humanity.

   Former Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. was
hospitalized Tuesday after suffering chest pains, a hospital
spokeswoman said.
   ``Mr. Brown is in for observation, evaluation and tests,''
Human-Hospital-Audubon spokeswoman Denise Damron said, reading from
a release. ``He was accompanied by his wife, Phyllis George Brown.''
   Brown, 55, had experienced the pains within the last couple of
days, Ms. Damron said.
   He was to undergo tests Wednesday, and more information may be
available then, Ms. Damron said.
   Brown, governor of Kentucky from 1979 to 1983, underwent triple
bypass heart surgery at the end of his term and developed serious
lung complications.
   He withdrew from his race against Walter ``Dee'' Huddleston for
the U.S. Senate in 1984 because of doctors' orders, Brown said at
the time.
   Brown also had surgery in 1986 to replace his hip.
   In 1987, he finished second in the Democratic gubernatorial
primary to Wallace Wilkinson.

<TEXT>
   Independence Day lived up to its name for Abe
Stolar, who made an emotional return to his hometown for the first
time since his family emigrated to the Sovet Union nearly 60 years
ago.
   ``I really can't find words,'' the 77-year-old Stolar told a
crowd of well-wishers and reporters as he stepped off a flight
Tuesday evening at O'Hare International Airport.
   Stolar was traveling from Israel, where he emigrated earlier this
year after a long fight to leave the Soviet Union.
   He said he had longed to return to the city he and his family
left for the Soviet Union when he was a teen-ager, but feared it
might never happen.
   ``I was an alien there for all the 58 years I was there,'' said
the native Chicagoan. ``It was a crime they didn't let me out.''
   He plans to get reacquainted with the city of his birth and to
tour the nation, taking in some baseball, junk food and other
all-American fare.
   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., who helped secure Stolar's release from
the Soviet Union, was on hand for the welcome home. He presented
Stolar and his Soviet-born wife, Gita Rozovskaya, a bouquet of red
roses, an American flag and a T-shirt reading, ``Chicago.''
   The senator called Stolar ``a real hero, a guy who has stood up
for freedom.''
   ``It is fitting Abe should return home to Chicago on the Fourth
of July,'' Simon said.
   Stolar, overwhelmed with emotion, searched for words to express
his feelings.
   ``What can I say, really,'' he said. ``I can't say anything but
thank you, thank you, thank you!''
   Stolar, whose parents immigrated from Russia in 1910, was raised
on the Northwest Side. But when he was 19, in 1931, the family
returned to their homeland, believing the Bolshevik Revolution had
created a workers' paradise.
   It didn't turn out that way.
   Stolar's father died in the Stalinist purges, and his mother and
sister were sent to camps in Siberia. Stolar was wounded by a German
hand grenade and lost the sight in one eye.
   He served in the Red Army during World War II, then worked as a
translator and announcer for Radio Moscow. But after nearly five
decades in the Soviet Union, Stolar wanted out.
   His exit proved more difficult than his entry.
   Promises that he could leave were repeatedly broken by Soviet
officials, who refused to let the whole family leave the country.
   After a 14-year fight, Stolar finally won freedom. In March, he,
his wife, son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren headed for
Israel, where they now live.
   ``We feel pampered by fate after all those disgusting, wasted,
stupid years,'' Stolar wrote in a recent letter to Simon. ``As so
many people have said before me, what a pity it comes so late in
life.''
   On visiting Chicago, he wrote, ``It will be a look at the old
town, which will really be all new to me, that few visitors, though
native born, can enjoy.''
   His agenda includes a baseball game at Wrigley Field, which looks
pretty much the same except for the new lights that will allow him
to catch Wednesday's night game between the Cubs and the San Diego
Padres.
   Stolar dreamed of one day staying in the fancy, 3,000-room
Stevens Hotel, a dream that will come true.
   The hotel, now the Chicago Hilton and Towers, has offered the
Stolars its 23rd-floor Chicago Suite. Despite recent refurbishing,
the grand ballroom and grand salon, glittering with mirrors and gold
leaf, are virtually unchanged, said assistant manager Peter Borup.
   No special menu is planned during Stolar's weeklong stay; he's
``a junk-food junkie'' who likes hamburgers and hot dogs, Borup said.
   Other stops on the Stolars' 12-city U.S. tour include Anchorage,
Alaska, and Miami. They'll end the trip with an Aug. 13 visit to Los
Angeles.
   Their visit was arranged and financed by Chicago Action for
Soviet Jewry.

   Hungarians who received coveted
invitations to a Fourth of July reception given by U.S. Ambassador
Mark Palmer got a second invitation on Tuesday _ to greet President
Bush next week.
   As the guests left, they were handed scrolls that contained a
typewritten sheet proclaiming in English and Hungarian that
``Everyone is invited'' to turn out to cheer for Bush when he
arrives on July 11 on the first visit by an incumbent U.S. president
to this communist-ruled nation.
   ``President Bush looks forward to greeting the people assembled
on Kossuth Square,'' it said, noting that this is his ``only
appearance in Hungary before the general public.''
   Kossuth Square is named after Lajos Kossuth, leader of Hungary's
ill-fated 1848 revolt against its Austrian rulers. It lies adjacent
to Budapest's historic parliament building.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, have
indicated they see Bush's East European swing as a counterpoint to
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's successful trips to the
West, where he has often been greeted by enthusiastic crowds.
   At least some of Bush's visit will be broadcast live on Hungarian
television and radio.

<TEXT>
   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
said Tuesday that membership in right-wing extremist groups climbed
a dramatic 12.8 percent last year and continues to rise.
   He also expressed concern about the increasingly popular
ultrarightist Republican Party headed by former Nazi SS soldier
Franz Schoenhuber. Schaeuble said many Republican pronouncements
``are similar to speech used by representatives of extremism.''
   Schoenhuber says his party is not extremist, but speaks out for
German interests and supports constitutional law.
   Membership in organizations officially labeled ``right-wing
extremist,'' including neo-Nazi groups, climbed to 28,300 last year
from 25,200 the year before, Schaeuble said. Those figures do not
include the estimated 13,000 Republicans, whose party has not been
officially labeled ``right-wing extremist.''
   Schaeuble said membership in right-wing extremist groups
continues to grow in this nation of 61 million, and may have already
surpassed 30,000.
   The Republicans concentrate on nationalist themes. They advocate
radical reductions in the number of asylum-seekers allowed to stay
in West Germany and strict limits on foreign workers.
   The party has made strong election showings in the past six
months, including winning its first seats in the European Parliament.
   Schaeuble told reporters that state and federal officials will
meet in September to examine whether the Republicans should be
labeled a right-wing extremist organization. If that happened, the
party would be kept under surveillance by the Verfassungschutz, the
country's main domestic intelligence agency.

<TEXT>
   United Farm Workers President Cesar Chavez
told more than 5,000 striking United Mine Workers and supporters who
rallied on the Fourth of July that their fight was just ``and people
never lose a just fight.''
   Chavez told the miners they faced economic tyranny from Pittston
Coal Group Inc. similar to the tyranny faced by American colonists
under King George III that led to the Declaration of Independence
213 years ago.
   ``The best place to spend the Fourth of July is here because the
struggle for freedom continues,'' Chavez, speaking from a flatbed
truck, told the gathering in a muddy field in the heart of the
southwest Virginia coalfields.
   ``We come from the battlefields of California to the battleground
of these coalfields,'' said Chavez. He urged strikers to continue
employing non-violent tactics of civil disobedience and asked the
crowd to join his union's boycott of grapes.
   ``Your struggle is our struggle. This is a just fight and people
never lose a just fight,'' he said.
   During the rally, UMW Vice President Cecil Roberts said the
National Labor Relations Board has declared the strike to be over
unfair labor practices committed by Pittston, rather than over
economic matters, such as wages and benefits.
   Roberts said the ruling by the board's general counsel means
striking miners will get their jobs back when a contract is
eventually signed.
   The determination brings additional pressure on Pittston to
resume contract negotiations, Roberts said. Talks broke off last
month and Pittston declared negotiations at an impasse.
   Pittston President Michael Odom said company officials will meet
with NLRB representatives to review the allegations of unfair labor
practices, and may fight the ruling before an administrative law
judge.
   ``Our position is that the board is in error,'' Odom said. ``This
is clearly an economic strike, one over terms and conditions of the
contract.''
   Odom said the NLRB ruling will have no effect on negotiations.
   The strike by 1,900 UMW members against Pittston Coal Group
operations in Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky has spawned
sympathy strikes that have idled some 37,000 workers in several
coal-mining states.
   At least a thousand of those wildcat strikers attended the rally.
   Dan Emmons of Booneville, Ind., who walked off his job at a
Peabody Coal Co. mine, said earlier that all UMW members have a
stake in the strike against Pittston, which is trying to break away
from an industry-wide contract with the union and win concessions.
   ``If we lose here, it's just going to be a chain reaction jumping
from company to company,'' he said.
   ``These boys need help down here,'' said Emmons. ``The main thing
we can do is keep their morale up and let them know they're not
standing alone.''
   Miners said the wildcat strikes, which began June 12 and are
officially unauthorized by the union, would continue until a
contract is signed.
   ``They'll last until this is settled,'' said Larry Heck of
Booneville, also a Peabody employee.
   Roger Myers, a UMW executive board member for Indiana, said about
125 cars, each carrying three or four Hoosier mine workers, left
southern Indiana on Sunday to attend the rally.
   Since the wildcat strikes began 2{ weeks ago, more than half of
Indiana's 1,750 striking coal workers have traveled to Virginia in
three separate caravans to show their support, Myers said.
   ``Those trips have made their resolve just that much stronger,''
Myers said.
   ``They go down there and break bread, so to speak, with the
strikers. It's just been unbelievable the way it's buoyed everyone's
spirits,'' he said.
   ``Every union man should be there,'' said Buster Varney, a strike
captain for UMW Local 5737 in Stone, Ky.
   Court orders have curtailed the union's strike activities around
Pittston mines and processing plants, so the UMW has turned to
rallies as an outlet for the idled miners. Tuesday's rally was the
third in the heart of the southwestern Virginia coal fields in three
weeks.

<HEAD>No Change in Blasphemy Laws, Britain Decides</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's ancient blasphemy laws will not be
changed because it would be difficult and could damage relations
among religious groups, the Home Office Minister John Patten said in
a letter to Moslem leaders on Tuesday.
   Patten also reiterated the government's lack of authority to ban
Salman Rushdie's novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which many Moslems
believe blasphemes Islam. He stressed the British author's right to
freedom of expression.
   Patten urged the 1 million Moslems and other ethnic groups to
participate more fully in British society, saying no room exists for
separation or segregation.
   Moslems and others want the blasphemy law extended to reflect
Britain's multicultural society. The law covers only Christianity,
specifically the Church of England, and has been used in courts only
twice in the past 67 years.
   ``The difficulties in redefining what should or should not be
blasphemous would be immense,'' Patten wrote.
   ``Should protection be extended to all faiths, including the very
minor or very obscure? Should it extend only to faiths believing in
one God? Or to major or mainstream faiths only? I believe there is
no equitable, just or right answer to these questions.''
   Patten said the government also feared ``a rush of litigation
which would damage relations between faiths.''
   He said Christians no longer rely on the law, ``preferring to
recognize that the strength of their own belief is the best armor
against mockers and blasphemers.''
   Patten acknowledged the continuing controversy over ``The Satanic
Verses,'' and said the government ``understands how much hurt and
anxiety that book has caused, and ... that insults, particularly to
a deeply held faith, are not easily forgotten or forgiven.''
   Rushdie, born into a Moslem family in India, has been in hiding
since Feb. 14 when Iran's late leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
ordered he be killed for blaspheming Islam. Khomeini died on June 3,
but the death sentence remains.
   Moslems say his book blasphemes Islam by associating the prophet
Mohammed with prostitutes and suggesting that the Koran, Islam's
holy book, was Mohammed's invention, not Allah's own work.
   Kalim Siddiqui, director of The Moslem Institute, said the
government ``has learned nothing'' from the controversy.
   ``There is no such thing as absolute freedom of expression or
speech,'' he said. ``We enjoy our freedom within certain limits.''
   He said Moslem leaders will meet to consider a response to
Patten's letter.
   ``We cannot live in this country together with `The Satanic
Verses' and Salman Rushdie,'' he said. ``They will have to go.''
   Liaqat Hussain, general secretary of the Council of Mosques in
Bradford, England, said, ``We will continue to protest and carry on
our campaign within the framework of the law.''

<HEAD>Adams Sues Producer of Film That Led To His Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The man whose murder conviction was thrown out
after it was questioned in the movie ``The Thin Blue Line'' is suing
the producer of the documentary for rights to his life story.
   Randall Dale Adams' lawsuit claims producer Errol Morris lost his
rights to Adams' life story in December 1988, when he failed to
exercise a two-year option purchased from Adams for $10 in December
1986.
   Adams was convicted of murdering a Dallas police officer and
served 12 years in prison before an appeals court overturned the
conviction. The court acted after the movie was released and it
became apparent that it was unlikely Adams could have been the
triggerman. Adams was freed from prison in March, and prosecutors
declined to retry him.
   Morris said he is ``hurt and upset'' that Adams is suing him
after all he went through to get him released.
   ``I worked very, very hard for a number of years to see that
justice was done in this case and to see that Randall Adams walked
out of prison,'' Morris said recently.
   The producer said his profits from the film, which was not widely
distributed, were ``nil'' and said he is still paying off debts from
the movie.
   ``The simple thing is that when I met Randall Adams, nobody cared
about the case, no one wanted to investigate it, no one wanted to
write about it,'' Morris said.
   Adams' attorney, Randy Schaffer, said Adams, 40, is not seeking
royalties, only a declaration that he owns the right to his own life
story so he can pursue offers estimated ``in the neighborhood of six
figures.''
   ``They think they bought (Adams) lock, stock and barrel for $10,
and that's unconscionable,'' Schaffer said. ``He is grateful, but
what is he supposed to do? He's got offers to do a book and a
movie.''
   District Judge Felix Salazar on Monday postponed a hearing on the
lawsuit filed two weeks ago because the defendants filed a motion to
move the proceedings to federal court.

<HEAD>Sudan Reports More Arrests of Politicians from Ousted Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fifteen southern politicians who served in
the ousted regime of Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi were arrested on
corruption charges Tuesday, an official statement said, bringing the
number of such arrests to 45.
   Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan Ahmed Bashir, head of the military junta
that cast out Mahdi on Friday, said earlier that 30 people from
northern Sudan were detained.
   Among those arrested Tuesday were Angel Beda, head of the
southern council; former Culture and Information Minister Yohannes
Yor Akol, and Govs. Lawrence Modi Tombe and Gabriel Yal Dok of the
Equatoria and Upper Nile regions.
   The leadership ordered all southern police, prison and wildlife
officers who had relocated to return to their positions. Many
southern officers fled the civil war in the south and went to
northern Sudan, claiming health reasons.
   Bashir also said a number of militias in the capital city of
Khartoum gave themselves up and those guarding Mahdi's Umma Party
headquarters fled after abandoning their weapons.
   He gave no details. Many political parties in Sudan have militias
loyal to them.
   Members of the new leadership met Tuesday with President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt in Alexandria, Egypt, on their first visit abroad
since the coup.
   After a 2{-hour meeting with Mubarak, Brig. Gen. Faisal
Abu-Saleh, head of the three-man delegation and a member of the
Command Council of the National Salvation Revolution, thanked Egypt
for its support of the coup and underlined the importance of close
relations between the two neighbors.
   ``My people have asked me to convey thanks to big brother
President Mubarak for all he has done for our nation and the
revolution,'' Abu-Saleh said.
   Relations between Cairo and Khartoum were strained before the
coup. Mahdi last month said security forces foiled a plot to
overthrow his government and restore to power former President
Gafaar Nimeiri, who has lived in exile in Egypt since his ouster in
1985.
   In an interview with Al-Khaleej newspaper of the United Arab
Emirates, published Tuesday, Bashir denied that Egypt or Nimeiri
helped him stage the overthrow.
   ``Egypt knew about the revolution only after its success and did
not plan it with us,'' he was quoted as saying.
   Nimeiri, who has described the officers who seized power as
``sincere patriots,'' cautioned them against conspiracies by
communists, according to an interview published Tuesday in the
Kuwaiti daily Al-Anbaa.
   He was quoted as saying he has abandoned plans to return to power
because the Friday coup ``fulfilled what I had in mind.''
   Nimeiri said he cabled his congratulations and ``absolute
support'' for Bashir's 15-member Command Council of the National
Salvation Revolution.
   The pro-Western Nimeiri said the new leadership has ``to be
vigilant and head off sabotage by communists as well as reactionary,
partisan and sectarian forces,'' Al-Anbaa reported.
   The paper quoted him as saying, ``My experiment as a ruler has
prompted me to have a profound conviction that a Western-type
democracy will fail in Sudan.''
   In Moscow, the Soviet news agency Tass reported that Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh told a briefing Tuesday that
``developments that took place in Sudan on the night of June 30 are
regarded in the Soviet Union as a purely internal matter of the
Sudanese people.''
   It said Gremitskikh expressed hope that the situation in Sudan
``would soon fully normalize and stabilize.''

<HEAD>North Faces Sentencing on Iran-Contra Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oliver North, who held the nation spellbound
with his testimony on the Iran-Contra affair two years ago, stands
before a judge Wednesday who could put him behind bars for 10 years.
   The special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra affair has asked U.S.
District Judge Gerhard Gesell to impose a prison term on the
45-year-old retired Marine lieutenant colonel on the grounds that he
lied and showed no remorse at his trial.
   Lawyers for the former national security aide who quarterbacked
the sale of arms to Iran in 1985 and diverted the profits to the
Nicaraguan contra rebels replied that it would be ``cruel and
unjust'' to incarcerate North.
   North was convicted on three felony counts and acquitted on nine
others, including a charge that he lied to Congress _ something he
admitted in testimony.
   His convictions were for aiding the obstruction of Congress
through helping to construct a false chronology of the affair, for
destroying sensitive government documents and for accepting a
$13,800 home security system from arms dealer Richard V. Secord, who
is awaiting trial on Iran-Contra charges.
   Defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. said in court papers
earlier this week that the prosecution's request for imprisonment
``demonstrates that it will stop at nothing in its effort to crush
Oliver North,'' and that sending him to prison would only encourage
high government officials to let subordinates take the blame for
``legally or politically risky'' ventures.
   During six days of testimony at the trial, North said he acted at
the direction of his superiors, including then-President Reagan.
   Since his conviction, he has continued to appear on the lecture
circuit, reportedly being paid $25,000 an appearance.

   Former President Ronald Reagan
suffered minor injuries Tuesday when he was thrown from a horse
while vacationing in Mexico, and he was treated at an Army hospital
near here, officials said.
   Reagan, 78, suffered mostly bruises and some minor scrapes, said
his spokesman, Mark Weinberg. ``He said he feels fine,'' Weinberg
said.
   Doctors who checked Reagan at Fort Huachuca's Raymond W. Bliss
Army Community Hospital in southeastern Arizona pronounced him in
excellent condition, Weinberg said in a telephone statement to news
agencies in Los Angeles.
   After treatment, Reagan returned to a private ranch in Sonora, a
Mexican state across the Arizona line, where Reagan has been
vacationing since Saturday, officials said.
   The accident apparently occurred around 10:05 a.m. MST, said
Capt. Juan Lopez, a U.S. Army doctor who examined Reagan at the
hospital.
   ``The horse Reagan was riding bucked wildly several times on a
rocky downhill slope and eventually stumbled,'' throwing Reagan,
Weinberg said.
   The former president joked that the accident was ``my own private
rodeo,'' Weinberg said. The spokesman said Reagan is ``an excellent
rider and he held on quite a while.''
   A U.S. Army helicopter flew Reagan to the hospital from the
ranch, officials said. Reagan arrived at Fort Huachuca at 11:20
a.m., said Maj. Dennis Seely, a base spokesman.
   X-rays revealed no serious injuries, Weinberg said.
   Reagan joked while in the hospital, and did not complain of any
pain, Lopez said. The doctor said the only advice he gave Reagan was
not to get involved in any stressful exercise for the rest of the
week.
   Reagan was released from the hospital at 3:10 p.m. Accompanied by
his wife, Nancy, he left the hospital and walked quickly to a
waiting Army helicopter, which departed for the ranch in Mexico.
   Lopez said Reagan declined to stay overnight, as physicians
suggested, so the hospital's chief nurse, Lt. Col. Paul Farineau,
accompanied the former president back to Mexico.
   Lopez said he would travel to Mexico on Wednesday to do a
follow-up check on Reagan.
   At the hospital, Mrs. Reagan was visited by June Scobee, widow of
space shuttle Challenger pilot Dick Scobee, Weinberg said. Mrs.
Scobee came by to wish the Reagans well and to tell Mrs. Reagan how
much she appreciated her support and kindness at the time of the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   The ranch is owned by William Wilson, a friend of the Reagans and
former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican. The former president plans to
celebrate Mrs. Reagan's birthday there on Thursday before returning
to his Los Angeles home at the end of the week, Weinberg said.
   Reagan took up riding when he was a young sportscaster in Des
Moines, Iowa in the 1930s and pursued it enthusiastically right
through his presidency. He would often take off one afternoon a week
to go riding at the Marine base in Quantico, Va.
   He once said, ``There is nothing better for the insides of a man
than the outside of a horse.''
   In Kennebunkport, Maine, President Bush was informed of Reagan's
accident by the Secret Service at 3:30 p.m., just before Bush went
boating, White House spokesman Bill Harlow said.
   ``The president was relieved to hear that President Reagan is
OK,'' Harlow said. ``He'll be calling him at some point.''
   Lt. Gen. Thurmond D. Rodgers, ranking officer at Fort Huachuca,
said Reagan told him to ``make sure people know that I was thrown
from the horse. I did not fall.''

   More than 3,000 people rallied in front of the
Statehouse in an Independence Day protest against the U.S. Supreme
Court decision giving the states broader power to restrict abortion.
   In Indianapolis, approximately 350 demonstrators, hoisting signs
and chanting ``We want free choice,'' rallied at the Indiana
Statehouse. About 400 pro-choice activists rallied outside the
Federal Building in Pittsburgh, and 350 paraded in Atlanta. In
Minneapolis, abortion rights demonstrators burning an American flag
in front of the federal building were attacked by three waiters from
a topless bar.
   Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Evelyn Murphy called for a crusade to keep
abortion safe and legal, and a coalition of abortion rights groups
followed with an announcement of a statewide campaign to vote
anti-abortion lawmakers out of office.
   ``The most fundamental liberty is the right to control our own
bodies,'' said state Rep. Susan D. Schur, a Democrat. ``For if we
have not the ability to control our own bodies, we are no more than
slaves.''
   The deeply divided court concluded its 1988-89 term by removing
some of the shackles that barred states from regulating most
abortions for 16 years. It soon could broaden state power even
further.
   Speaker after angry speaker took to the podium in Boston to
assert that no government should violate a woman's right to privacy
and no court should have jurisdiction over her body.
   ``I'm tired of those who say their moral and religious views are
universal principles,'' declared Schur. ``They then insist that
their beliefs become my law.''
   As the rally wound down, about 300 demonstrators marched down
Beacon Hill to the Esplanade along the Charles River. They demanded
the use of the microphones at the Hatch Shell to broadcast their
message to the tens of thousands of people picnicking and sunbathing
in anticipation of the annual Boston Pops concert and fireworks
display.
   About 250 police officers were already there to handle the
holiday crowds, and a line of about 30 officers prevented the
demonstrators from reaching the stage.
   ``The pro-choice outcry will be the beginning of a new American
revolution,'' Pam Nourse, head of Mass Choice, told the Beacon Hill
rally.
   Protesters waved American flags and held signs with slogans
including ``My rights have been raped.''
   In Indianapolis, speakers from women's, civil rights and abortion
rights groups told about 350 demonstrators they need to marshal
their political clout to fight anti-abortion legislation expected in
the 1990 General Assembly as a result of the Supreme Court decision.
   ``This rally marks day one in the fight for our lives,'' said
Melinda Rider, executive director of the Indiana Pro-Choice Action
League.
   ``We're going to send a message to Governor (Evan) Bayh and
legislators: `You are not going to make these decisions. We, the
people are going to make these decisions,''' said Rider.
   ``You take our rights, you lose your jobs,'' she said.
   In Pittsburgh, the 400 or so abortion rights activists were met
by as many anti-abortion activists.
   Among the youngest pickets was 3-year-old Jennette Maddok, who
held a sign that read, ``Mommy had a choice _ why can't I?''
   Her father, John Maddock, said he and his wife, Janine Maddock,
attended the abortion rights rally because ``this is a family thing
with us.''
   ``Jennette was our choice,'' Mrs. Maddock said. ``It was a
serious decision, emotionally and financially. We think it's
important for people to come out and express their opinion.''
   Marchers in Atlanta carried signs that read, ``I'm mad as hell,
and I vote'' and ``It's not Independence Day for Missouri women,''
as well as an effigy of a Supreme Court justice.
   The rally ended with the demonstrators burning the effigy with an
American flag wrapped around it. The effigy did not appear to be of
a specific justice.
   The flag-burning in Minneapolis occurred as about 150 abortion
rights demonstrators rallied outside the federal building.
   When a small group of protesters began burning a flag, three
waiters from the Solid Gold nightclub ran across the street and
attacked them, said police watch commander Ed Scott. One of the
waiters was arrested.
   Some protesters had first burned a cardboard replica of an
American flag. Sheri Smith of Action for Abortion Rights, one of the
rally organizers, said most protesters did not support the flag
burning.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army commander here said
Tuesday that America will keep asserting its rights in Panama and
that he hoped Panamanians someday ``will not allow a dictator to
tell them which rights they can or can not have.''
   ``I would hope that the sacrifices made by many people to obtain
our freedoms in the United States serve as an example to Latin
Americans. I hope that some day they, too, have an opportunity to
have the same basic freedoms we have,'' said Brig. Gen. Mark
Cisneros.
   ``As a Hispanic, I want to see Hispanics get the same rights we
have. Those freedoms should be basic to every country because
everybody aspires to the same freedoms that should not be demeaned
as we see here in Panama.''
   Cisneros, the target of recent attacks by Panama's
government-controlled news media, was promoted Friday from chief of
operations of the U.S. Southern Command to commander of the U.S.
Army South.
   He spoke to reporters after reviewing an Independence Day parade
of U.S. forces at Ft. Clayton.
   Cisneros dismissed accusations by Panamanian newspapers that
Washington was interfering in Panama's affairs when American troops
recently held a drill at Madden Dam, a Panama Canal installation.
   He said the drill ``was part of an exercise I ordered to defend
the canal. Under the terms of the Carter-Torrijos treaties, we have
the right to do it.''
   The dam is part of a system used to maintain the water level of
the waterway, since the Atlantic and Pacific oceans it links stand
at different levels.
   Under treaties signed in 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and Gen.
Omar Torrijos, the late Panamanian strongman, the United States has
the right to defend the canal until the year 2000, when ownership is
turned over to Panama.
   Cisneros said America faces a ``dangerous situation in Panama
with the Defense Forces'' and ``must be ready to defend (itself)
against a band of crazies.''
   The Panamanian Defense Forces are commanded by Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   Washington has tried without success to force out Noriega,
Panama's de facto leader, since he was indicted on U.S. drug
trafficking in February 1988. Noriega denies the charges.
   Cisneros dismissed accusations by Noriega that the United States
intends to invade Panama and avoid honoring the canal treaties,
calling the assertions ``part of a vicious campaign of
misinformation.''
   The United States has 12,000 troops stationed in Panama.
   Thousands of dependents and civilian employees cheered marching
units from the U.S. forces. The U.S. Embassy deputy chief of
mission, John Maisto, read an Independence Day proclamation from
President Bush.
   Most of the Americans spent the rest of the day at picnics.

<HEAD>Soviets Report on Troops Firing During Uzbekistan Ethnic Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Soviet general said Tuesday soldiers fired on six
occasions and that 103 civilians were killed and hundreds of houses
burned or looted during mass ethnic disturbances in Uzbekistan's
Fergana region in June.
   Maj. Gen. Alexander Griyenko spoke at a news conference at which
reporters were shown photographs of charred bodies, destroyed and
burned houses and smashed cars _ ``all done by extremists'' in that
Central Asian republic, the Soviet news agency Tass said.
   Griyenko said three soldiers ``sustained gunshot wounds and 161
were injured.'' He added that in all, 511 Interior Ministry
servicemen were wounded in unrest that hit various parts of the
nation since February.
   The general said nearly 10,000 people were arrested in the unrest
in the predominantly Moslem Uzbekistan republic _ 9,092 for curfew
violations and 700 for breaking the peace. About 10,000 guns were
confiscated, he said.
   Griyenko reported that 754 houses, 28 state facilities and 275
cars were burned or looted.
   He said Interior Ministry troops fired only at ``specific
extremists'' as they were trying to attack the soldiers and that
``the use of arms in all cases was absolutely justified, as shown by
an investigation conducted by the prosecutor's office,'' Tass added.
   The general is a member of the military council of the ministry's
300,000-strong forces.
   Earlier reports put the number of Fergana dead at about 100. The
rioting, arson and murders began in early May and continued into
June, pitting ethnic Uzbeks against the Meskhi Turk minority, which
was forcibly resettled to the region from the southern Georgia
republic by dictator Josef Stalin in 1944.
   Authorities pledged last month to create 200,000 jobs, clean up
polluting factories and grow more food in the region to stem the
economic and environmental problems blamed for much of the unrest.
   According to Griyenko, weapons were not used against people
during other mass ethnic disturbances in Nagorno-Karabakh, Sumgait,
Georgia and Kazakhstan.
   Griyenko said ministry troops are assigned to curb violations of
public order if they are large-scale, pose a threat to life,
disorganize the work of enterprises and are directed at destroying
state, public or personal property.
   The law allows these troops to use arms only as an extreme
measure.
   Regarding riot-control gear, Griyenko said the soldiers'
equipment included bullet-proof vests, plastic and metal shields,
rubber truncheons, all types of short-barrel firearms, water cannon
and tear gas.
   Last year, Interior Ministry forces used tear gas more than 1,000
times, but there were no fatalities or cases of a long-term effect
on health, he said.
   On April 9, 20 people were killed when Soviet troops attacked
rioters in Tbilisi, Georgia. Georgians said the troops used a potent
form of tear gas.

   A man trying to burn the American flag on the steps of the
Arkansas Capitol in Little Rock was thwarted Tuesday in his second
attempt. In Albany, N.Y., angry veterans stopped a protester from
igniting Old Glory at a courthouse.
   In New York City, a flag-burning ceremony fizzled when a handful
of left-wing would-be flag-burners were met by 60 right-wing
flag-protecting skinheads. A small group of performance artists in
Chicago hung a large U.S. flag between two trees, doused it with
charcoal starter and burned it.
   Elsewhere, abortion rights activists burning an American flag in
front of the federal building in Minneapolis were attacked by three
waiters from a nearby topless bar, police said. One waiter was
arrested.
   Activist Robert ``Say'' McIntosh, 45, of Little Rock said he
would make a third attempt to burn the flag at the Capitol on Sunday
to show that there is not justice for all in the United States.
   His son, Robert McIntosh Jr., 27, said he managed to set a flag
on fire in a Capitol corridor, but nobody saw it. The younger
McIntosh was among at least five people arrested by police after two
shoving matches on the Capitol steps.
   The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last month that flag burning is a
constitutionally protected right of free speech.
   The younger McIntosh, also of Little Rock, was injured when he
and companions emerged from the building carrying a charred flag and
tried to burn it in a metal trash barrel. He received a bloody gash
on the forehead and was taken in handcuffs to a Little Rock police
car.
   The younger McIntosh was charged with disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest, and was arranging $350 bond, said Pulaski County
Sheriff's Department spokeswoman Sherry Rainey.
   About 500 people had gathered in front of the Capitol to protest
McIntosh's planned flag-burning. About 50 state, Capitol and Little
Rock police officers stood in a line across the lower steps of the
Capitol.
   The activist had marched with a half-dozen companions to the spot
where his first demonstration ended in a fistfight last week.
   McIntosh got to the steps, and a metal trash barrel he intended
to use to burn the flag was grabbed by the throng. A few punches
were thrown, officers moved in, and McIntosh was rushed inside the
second-floor Capitol doors, wearing handcuffs.
   Col. Richard Rail, assistant director of the Arkansas State
Police, said McIntosh was ordered to leave the premises, and agreed
to do so.
   Four people were arrested on disorderly conduct charges in the
two brawls.
   In Albany, angry veterans told a protester that his rights to
free speech did not include setting fire to the national symbol.
   Paul Weinman was one of eight members of the Albany group
Americans for Free Speech who rallied in the New York capital to
support the Supreme Court's ruling.
   Each time Weinman tried to burn the flag, his lighter was knocked
away by local veterans who showed up on the steps of the U.S.
District Court building in downtown Albany.
   ``Are you a combat veteran?'' one veteran asked Weinman.
   ``Freedom of speech is opening your mouth and talking, not
burning a flag,'' another veteran said.
   The confrontation turned into a ``pushing and shoving match,''
but police took no action, said Assistant Police Chief William
Murray.
   The flag-burning demonstration in New York City was attended by
about 15 Chinese demonstrators, who have been staging a hunger
strike at the United Nations to protest the crushing of
pro-democracy activists in China.
   Chinese journalist Justin Yu, noting the destruction of a statue
of the ``Goddess of Democracy'' erected by pro-Democracy protesters
in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, said the demonstrators Tuesday
``didn't want another symbol of democracy, the flag, to be destroyed
here.''
   Between the skinheads, the left-wingers and the Chinese
protesters, ``it was very confusing,'' said Yu.
   In Chicago's lakefront Lincoln Park, three of the flag-burning
performance artists wore paper masks depicting members of the
Monkees pop group and held a sign reading, ``We are the daydream
believers,'' referring to a title of a Monkees' song.
   ``We are celebrating our right to dissent in our country while we
still have it,'' said Patrick Cannon, 28.
   In Minneapolis, one man was arrested and several protesters
suffered scrapes and bruises, but no one was injured seriously, said
police watch commander Ed Scott.
   The flag-burning occurred as about 150 abortion rights
demonstrators rallied outside the federal building to protest
Monday's U.S. Supreme Court decision giving states freedom to impose
more restrictions on abortions.
   As a small group of the protesters burned a flag, three waiters
from the Solid Gold nightclub came across the street and attacked
them, Scott said.
   Some protesters had first burned a cardboard replica of an
American flag. Sheri Smith of Action for Abortion Rights, one of the
rally organizers, said most protesters did not support the
flag-burning.

   The fight over abortion, called ``our Vietnam
of the 1990s'' by one partisan, returns to 50 state legislatures
with new intensity sparked by the latest Supreme Court ruling.
   But the high court's role in the deeply divisive legal and
political struggle is far from over.
   Ending its 1988-89 term Monday, the court cut back sharply on
women's constitutional right to abortion. But it stopped short of
letting states outlaw most abortions.
   The justices also said that sometime in 1990 they will decide
three new disputes _ a move that could lead them to scrap the
court's 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade legalizing abortion.

   Most of the fireworks being set off to
celebrate American freedom this week were shipped from China before
that country's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators, a
fireworks expert says.
   The Chinese have targeted the U.S. fireworks market since
relations improved during the Nixon administration and now dominate
the market, said John A. Conkling, a Maryland chemist who heads the
American Pyrotechnics Association.
   Conkling, who operates a seasonal ``Fireworks Hotline'' in
Washington, said shipments from China had either arrived or were
aboard vessels by the time the disturbances began that led to last
month's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. Hundreds,
perhaps thousands, of people were killed.
   ``I think the fact that for the past 15 years we've celebrated
Independence Day with fireworks coming from a communist country
means there has been an irony quite a while,'' he said. ``It is
heightened by the incidents this year.''

   ``As far as the popularity of Mr. Gorbachev is concerned and the

   President Bush is preparing for his
upcoming trip to Poland by staking out a position likely to go over
well there _ a call for the Soviet Union to withdraw its troops from
the East bloc nation.
   Bush, who leaves Sunday for a stop in Poland on his way to the
European economic summit, said the Soviets should pull out of Poland
and take ``an historic opportunity to help end the postwar division
in Europe.''
   The White House staff at his Maine vacation home released a text
Monday of an interview with a group of Polish reporters in which
Bush made the proposal on Soviet troops. The interview on Friday
marked the first time he has called for a total pullout.
   The news came on a day when Bush also issued a statement
applauding the Supreme Court's decision opening the door to more
restrictions on abortions.

   Lawyers for Oliver North say imprisoning the
former presidential aide would only encourage high-level government
officials to evade responsibility for legally risky activity.
   Responding to the prosecution's call for a prison term for North,
defense lawyers said in court papers Monday that ``a sentence of
imprisonment would be cruel and unjust.''
   ``Such a sentence would be deeply and fundamentally unfair,'' the
defense said in the pre-sentence memo filed in U.S. District Court.
   The 45-year-old former National Security Council aide is
scheduled to be sentenced Wednesday for three felony convictions
arising from his involvement in the Iran-Contra affair.

   A wind-whipped fire roared
through canyons near Los Angeles, damaging more than a dozen homes
and forcing 500 people to flee flames that jumped from brush to
rooftops.
   Firefighters facing a hot, dry Fourth of July today attempted to
douse the blaze as it raced along a ridge of homes in exclusive
Turnbull Canyon, 20 miles east of downtown Los Angeles.
   Los Angeles County Fire Inspector John Lenihan said the fire had
destroyed or damaged 13 to 15 homes but there were no immediate
reports of injuries.
   ``It's nowhere near control,'' Lenihan said late Monday. ``We've

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari broke
tradition at the beginning of his term: He made no dramatic
announcement about fighting corruption in Mexico's government and
business.
   To the astonishment of cynics, he took action instead _ jailing
oil union leaders, stockbrokers and dozens of drug-running police on
corruption charges.
   But his message hasn't penetrated Mexico's bureaucracy, where a
bribe still can be expected to renew a visa, obtain a trade permit
or connect a telephone line.
   ``Now, there's confusion,'' said one business analyst. ``People
believe Salinas' people are clean, but they're still dealing with
some of the same middle-level officials. They don't know what to
do.''
   For most public servants, the opportunity to earn a decent wage
comes once in a lifetime. With no career civil service and no merit
system guaranteeing promotions, tens of thousands lose their jobs at
each change of administration.
   While padding slim government incomes is not unique to Mexico,
under the authoritarian system that has governed the country since
before the time of the Spanish Conquest, corruption spread well
beyond the economic arena.
   It has hurt the nation's pride, tarnished elections and in some
instances claimed lives. An internal government study estimated that
federal highway police bribes cost the economy $3 million a day.
   ``The authoritarian nature of government lends itself to
corruption,'' said Samuel del Villar, an adviser to former President
Miguel de la Madrid and political scientist at the Colegio de
Mexico. ``Without accountability to the people, officials enjoy the
discretional authority to impose bribes and arbitrary fees.''
   Salinas, inaugurated Dec. 1, inherited a monumental task from de
la Madrid, who took office in 1982 amid growing perception that
corruption _ fed by the sudden wealth to be had in the oil-boom
years _ was out of control and had infected the private sector.
   ``To get the commerce department to authorize a price increase
for a product used to mean leaving an envelope behind,'' said the
business analyst, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. ``You'd
take up a collection from other businesses before you went.''
   De la Madrid decreed a law, prepared by del Villar and a team of
legal experts, that extended criminal liability for corrupt
practices by public servants. It was the heart of de la Madrid's
``moral renovation'' campaign against corruption, and it failed.
   ``Moral renovation failed because no one bothered to apply the
public servants law,'' del Villar said. ``Indictments were
discretional, and in this case no one wanted to do it.''
   Salinas abandoned ``moral renovation'' and ordered the arrests
that so far have netted Joaquin Hernandez Galicia, the longtime
chief of the powerful oil workers union; Eduardo Legoretta, a top
businessman charged with stock market fraud, and dozens of police
agents in northwestern Mexico alleged to have closed their eyes to
drug trafficking.
   Salinas' attorney general on April 27 ordered the arrest of
Carlos Robles Loustaunau, who stepped down as mayor of Hermosillo,
and three aides on charges of getting themselves elected last July
through fraud. They are members of Salinas' own Institutional
Revolutionary Party, commonly known as PRI, its Spanish initials.
   Taking their cue from Salinas and his drive to modernize Mexico's
economy, some Mexican business leaders have openly attacked official
bribe-taking.
   ``We are tired of corruption,'' Jorge Ocejo Moreno, president of
the National Association of Industries in Transformation, declared
in April.
   Treasury, health, commerce and other federal department officials
``extort us without end,'' he asserted.
   To Salinas, both bureaucrats and private sector leaders are to
blame for corruption that saps the economy and his own plans to
generate growth.
   Salinas has promised measures to crack down on police corruption
and to professionalize Mexico's police forces.
   As budget director under de la Madrid, Salinas helped change the
system of import licenses that encouraged corruption; other
deregulatory changes have also helped reduce the number of rules
that can lead to extortion or bribery.
   Salinas also has laid down the law on chronic tax evasion by
decreeing a 2 percent tax on business assets. Vociferous business
protests have been largely ignored.
   Even so, the roll call of corruption in Mexico remains long and
varied:
   _Proud host of the 1986 World Cup soccer championship, Mexico
won't field a team in the 1990 games. It was caught red-handed with
four over-age players in an international youth tourney last year.
   _Salinas' own election was the most disputed in the 60-year
history of the PRI. Salinas won just over half the vote, but reports
abounded of multiple-voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud.
   _Mayor Manuel Camacho Solis of Mexico City in December ordered
all car owners in the capital to have their vehicles tested to fight
the city's smog, generally considered the world's worst. Almost
immediately, inspectors began passing polluting cars for fees
ranging up to double the price of testing.
   _Two Acapulco judges were suspended in December and face trial on
charges of accepting a $200,000 bribe to order the release from
prison of Alejandro Braun Diaz, a 34-year-old playboy convicted of
raping and killing a 6-year-old girl. Braun is believed to have fled
to Canada.
   _On Dec. 11, explosions and fire ripped through a crowded Mexico
City street market, killing 62 people. Residents blamed tons of
illegal fireworks sold at the market and said police had been bribed
to ignore the threat. ``The government allowed them to sell here,''
said a woman whose parents died in the blast.

   Day after day, year after year,
Venezuelans read or hear of official corruption, but not a single
person has ever been convicted, at least no one from the political
establishment.
   Corruption seems so deeply rooted and may have gained so many
adherents in Venezuela, the author Arturo Uslar Pietri suggests,
that the honest should regarded as fools.
   ``Normal in Venezuela is to take advantage of a political
position to obtain personal benefits and become rich,'' he said in
an interview. ``Those who don't do it are considered inferiors.''
   But corruption cases in Venezuela become so entangled that few
can sort them out and in the end they fade away in a loss of
interest by a confused public.
   The latest case involves elimination of a government agency known
as Recadi, which in the previous government distributed $40 billion
for subsidized imports.
   Of that amount, some $6 billion is said to have been granted
fraudulently, mostly by overpricing, personal connections or even
outright bribery, contributing to the depletion of the nation's
monetary reserves.
   In a swirl of charges and counter charges, one figure in the
scandal attempted suicide; the leftist past of the judge handling
the case was brought into play with implications that he is acting
for political reasons; the judge sent an industrialist to jail for
eight days for charging that the judge himself took bribes and for
blaming the Recadi fraud on a former president and his sweetheart
secretary.
   Recadi was created in early 1983 as Venezuela's oil bonanza began
to fade and exchange restrictions were imposed. Cheap dollars were
lavishly granted via Recadi to both private and public companies for
imports that otherwise would have fueled inflation.
   But it soon became a ``nest of corruption ... that was
practically designed for fraud,'' congressional investigators have
charged.
   A thorough investigation, however, might take years just to check
the 14,000 or so companies that received cheap dollars.
   In one case, millions of dollars were granted to import Holstein
heifers to improve Venezuela's dairy stock. The heifers turned out
not to be Holsteins but ``scrawny, feeble specimens,'' as one
rancher described them.
   Hundreds of the heifers were abandoned on a plain to become
carrion for vultures, the newspaper El Nacional reported.
   In another incident, Ana Teresa Herrera was fired as a Recadi
inspector when she began investigating a company that had been
granted $14 million to import three airplanes; only one was brought
to Venezuela.
   ``And that plane never flew,'' she told reporters after
testifying before Judge Luis Guillermo de la Riva, who is in charge
of the current Recadi case.
   The scandal became a drama when former Development Minister
Hector Meneses, whose office also granted cheap dollars for imports,
shot himself in the head. He survived but lost the sight of one eye
and remains in a coma in a Caracas hospital, unable to tell what he
knows.
   Before shooting himself, Meneses wrote a letter to his wife
claiming innocence and suggesting he had merely carried out
instructions from two of his former colleagues. They, in turn, also
claimed innocence.
   So far only eight people have been jailed to await trial,
although de la Riva has issued 32 arrest warrants.
   In a setback for the judge, however, it turned out that most of
subjects of the warrants had resigned from their business jobs long
before Recadi was even created and no longer live in Venezuela.
   Then de la Riva also came under the fire of critics who recalled
that he had, years before, supported leftist guerrillas. The
implication was that it was more than coincidence that leftist
congressmen were leading the public outcry in the case.
   Another setback for the judge was his order for the arrest of
Nicomedes Zuloaga, member of a prominent Venezuelan family and
president of Gramoven, a grain processing company accused of
importing overpriced wheat.
   Upon turning himself in, Zuloaga noted that he was Venezuela's
ambassador to Argentina when the alleged overpricing took place. A
friend, Alfredo Paul Delfino, accused the judge of receiving bribes
and charged that former President Jaime Lusinchi and his private
secretary and companion, Blanca Ibanez, were ``the real thieves.''
   De la Riva ordered Delfino to jail for eight days.
   Lusinchi, whose affair with Ibanez and his attempt to divorce his
wife of more than 40 years constituted a scandal in his years as
president, has threatened to file suit against Delfino.
   ``In the Recadi case there is a too much transparent classism,''
the independent newspaper El Universal said in an editorial. ``There
are no politicians in jail and the (law's) hand strikes only on
businessmen whereas the ones to blame for the corruption were within
Recadi.''
   As the plot becomes more entangled, many believe that behind the
scandal lies a political struggle between Lusinchi and President
Carlos Andres Perez, who took office in February, for the leadership
of their Accion Democratica, the biggest in Venezuela.

   A Turkish peasant claims one of his kidneys was
stolen. Philippines prison inmates trade organs for reduced
sentences. Brokers in human body parts take their cut of a shadowy
market.
   The forces of supply and emand in the desperate world of organ
transplants have created a commercial trade in human organs that
worries health officials and ethicists worldwide.
   The need for organs to replace faltering body parts is growing as
research advances and surgery is more successful. But the number of
donated organs has failed to keep pace. Doctors say too few people
die in circumstances that provide transplantable organs. When they
do, relatives are often too grieved to donate a loved one's organ or
object for religious or cultural reasons.
   Last fall, reports in foreign newspapers that adoption rings were
routinely buying babies in Third World countries and selling them to
American and Israeli families whose children needed organ
transplants drew angry U.S. reaction.
   The State Department in October blamed the Soviet Union for the
reports and said a European Parliament resolution criticizing the
purported activity was based on ``false and misleading statements
and a discredited report by a Soviet front organization.''
   What to do about the organ trade varies. The United States, Japan
and West Germany ban it. In India, such trade thrives legally.
Lawmakers in Britain and the Philippines have just begun grappling
with the matter.
   ``There simply doesn't seem to be any country that has a public
policy to generate enough organs to meet the demand,'' said Arthur
Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the
University of Minnesota.
   The World Health Organization in May called for a global ban on
commercial trafficking in human organs. Dr. Ursula Lehr, the West
German health minister, spoke for the ban.
   ``The idea of business-minded brokers taking advantage of the
financial distress of people in the Third World, buying their organs
for a pittance and reselling them to wealthy patients in developed
countries, is awful for me,'' she said.
   But some ask what's wrong if people, fully informed of the risks,
decide to sell one of their organs, for example, a kidney? The
question, however, becomes complicated when the potential donor is
desperately poor. People can live with one kidney, and offers for
transplantable kidneys have ranged in individual instances from
$3,000 to $20,000.
   ``Is it really for us, who are not faced with those difficulties
and that heart-rending decision, to deny people that choice?'' Neil
Hamilton, a British lawmaker, asked in recent parliamentary debate.
   ``It really isn't a choice if you're coerced by poverty,'' said
Caplan, the Minnesota ethicist.
   Others worry that selling organs would decrease the supply of
donated organs and make transplants more expensive in general.
   ``We believe ... organs would go to the highest bidder rather
than to the patient who needs them most,'' said Bernadette Haze, a
spokeswoman for the Netherlands-based Eurotransplant, which matches
organ donors and recipients in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
West Germany and Austria.
   Britain, which has no law controlling the sale of organs, took up
the issue this year after a Turk was arrested in Istanbul for
arranging commercial transplants at a private London hospital. One
of the ``donors'' contended he was duped and robbed of his kidney.
   The alleged organ broker, Tunc Ay Kunter, was convicted May 18
and sentenced to two years in prison for brokering the sale of a
Turkish peasant's kidney to a Libyan doctor. Police said Kunter
confessed to arranging four such sales when he was arrested.
   Turkish law allows organ donation but outlaws selling, brokering
or buying human organs.
   The peasant, Ahmet Koc, who got a two-year suspended sentence,
contended he went to the hospital for a physical connected to a job
offer and thought he was being anesthetized for the checkup. After
the kidney was removed, he said he was paid the equivalent of $4,267.
   British lawmakers have introduced legislation making it a crime
to pay or receive payment for a human organ. Parliament is expected
to pass it this month.
   Organ sales are not illegal in the Philippines, but in late May,
the vice president of the Philippines Senate filed a bill to ban
sales of human organs and tissues, calling practitioners
``modern-day Draculas.''
   Filipino death row prisoners began donating organs in 1976 as
part of a program to reduce overcrowding without resorting to
widespread executions, explained Pablo Rosales, assistant director
of the National Penitentiary. Rosales said most donor inmates
avoided execution and some were freed after spending a few more
years in prison.
   When capital punishment was banned in 1987, prisoners started
asking for money, he said. One prisoner who donated a kidney even
complained to Rosales that he received only $95, without the
mini-cassette recorder he was promised.
   Media attention greatly reduced the number of people seeking
prisoners' organs, Rosales said, and no prisoner has donated a
kidney since last year.
   But Rosales believes organ sales continue with private donors,
most likely poor slum dwellers.
   Dr. Kazuo Ota, chairman of the Japan Society for Transplantation,
said he knew of several patients who had organ transplants in the
Philippines and that some Japanese were acting as organ brokers.
Organ sales are banned in Japan.
   Dr. Jorge Neumann of the Sao Paulo Heart Institute and a member
of the Brazilian Association of Organ Transplants said ``certainly
there exists a black market of organs in Brazil.'' But he said no
statistics on organ sales were available.
   In the United States, selling organs has been illegal since 1984
and sentiment against the practice is high. But allegations of
influence peddling in arranging precious transplants surface from
time to time.
   In April, Justice Department investigators said they had dropped
an investigation into accusations that pioneering surgeon Thomas
Starzl, head of transplants at Presbyterian-University and
Children's hospitals in Pittsburgh, had given high-paying foreigners
preferential treatment.
   The investigation followed newspaper articles that said about 28
percent of transplants performed by Starzl's team in 1984-5 were on
foreigners who often weren't as sick as other patients or had waited
a shorter time, but who had paid surgeon's fees four times higher
than Americans who had the same operations.
   Caplan argues for regulations to ensure that medical need, rather
than money or influence, determines who gets available organs.
   Some in the field say the risk of exploitation would be reduced
if a neutral party, such as government, replaced organ brokers. And
donations might increase with incentives such as compensation to
donors or their families for all medical costs, time lost from work
or burial expenses. There could also be a break on inheritance or
other taxes.
   Recently, transplant researchers began looking at animal-to-human
transplants.
   At a May meeting of the American Society of Transplant
Physicians, researchers predicted pigs would become the main source
of donor organs once cross-species transplantation becomes practical.
   ``There's always been a shortage of organs and there probably
always will be unless we learn to take them out of animals,'' said
Caplan. ``I don't know if it's going to be biologically feasible,
but I think that's the direction we have to try.''

   A government effort to ban trade in body parts was
prompted by a kidneys-for-cash scandal at a private London hospital
this year.
   ``The concept of organs being bought and sold for money is
entirely unacceptable in a civilized society,'' Health Minister
Roger Freeman told a House of Commons committee during debate on
proposed legislation outlawing organ sales. The bill is expected to
pass Parliament later this month.
   Not all lawmakers agree.
   ``The bill will cause death where there could be life, and to
prolong suffering where we could provide relief,'' said Sir Michael
McNair-Wilson, a Conservative Parliament member awaiting a kidney
transplant.
   The legislation will make it a crime to pay or receive payment
for a human organ, act as broker in such transactions, or solicit
buyers or sellers. It will, however, permit voluntary donors to be
reimbursed for the costs of removing a kidney.
   British lawmakers acted after news reports in January that
Turkish peasants were paid to donate kidneys for transplant surgery
at the private Humana Wellington Hospital. Turkish authorities said
donors were paid $3,200 to $5,600.
   Following the disclosures, Humana Hospital barred two doctors and
the General Medical Council, the disciplinary body for British
physicians, opened an investigation.
   Freeman said a Gallup Poll commissioned in February by the
British Kidney Patients Association found 87 percent of the
respondents opposed commercial transactions in human organs.
   ``Whether they would think the same if faced with the choice of
paying for an organ or of one not being available, thereby causing
death or prolonged suffering for a member of the family or a close
friend, is another matter,'' McNair-Wilson said in committee debate.
   ``We are discussing a shortage of organs for transplant,
particularly of kidneys. The waiting list stands at 3,500 people,
but the list is growing,'' he said. ``Many people are suffering
considerable discomfort for long periods. Many people, who could
survive if they had a new kidney, die without cause.''
   Freeman conceded donations, which average 1,500 a year, were
falling short of demand and noted that health authorities had been
ordered to find ways to identify potential donors. The government
has also asked health workers to record every death in intensive
care and analyze why useable organs were not transplanted.
   After publicity about his plight, McNair-Wilson said a woman in
Australia wrote to offer a kidney for $20,000. According to
McNair-Wilson, the woman said she had lost her home in a bush fire,
had no insurance and was sick of ``pulling myself and my children up
by the bootstraps.''
   Neil Hamilton, who cast the only vote against the bill in
committee, said he had pondered the dilemma facing one Turk who
allegedly sold a kidney.
   ``His daughter was suffering from a medical problem which
threatened her life, but it could not be solved in Turkey without
money,'' Hamilton said. ``If he did not get the money for the
operation, his daughter would die.''
   A similar argument for the right to sell organs was advanced by
Royden Harrison, emeritus professor of social history at Warwick
University, in a February letter to The Times of London.
   ``What possible objection can there be if one person, of their
own free will and without duress, should sell their kidney to
someone else?'' he asked. ``Nor is there any wrong done by the
middleman who makes a profit out of this transaction. The seller is
able to indulge in a few of the good things in life. The buyer may
well be paying to survive.''

   Abdul Hai, a stocky 34-year-old now in
police detention, sells human kidneys for a living.
   He wasn't jailed for dealing in kidneys; the sale of body organs
is legal in India. Hai was arrested when a kidney donor complained
of being mugged after refusing to pay Hai a commission.
   Hai says he's one of about 100 middlemen who procure kidneys for
the ailing rich from Bombay's willing poor.
   Hai, who worked as a doctor's chaffeur before becoming a kidney
broker, said he has arranged the sale of 20 kidneys since a surgeon
suggested the business to him a year ago.
   ``People queue up, ready to give away a kidney. You can find such
donors everywhere,'' he said in a cellblock interview.
   Hai was arrested May 12 after Dhanraj Agarwal, a street vendor,
told police two people attacked him and stole almost $2,000 he had
been paid for a kidney. Agarwal said the attack came minutes after
he refused to give Hai a commission, according to police inspector
Appa Sahib Shinde.
   ``We have detained him only on suspicion of robbery, and it
doesn't matter to me if he sells kidneys for a living or not,'' said
Shinde. Hai has denied involvement in the robbery.
   Hai told a reporter he charged roughly $95 to $190 for matching
donors and patients. India requires a kidney donor to officially
affirm his desire to voluntarily give up a kidney, but before that
moment the donor could already have collected $1,875 to $3,125 from
the recipient, Hai said.
   The flourishing kidney trade has sharply divided Indian doctors
along ethical lines.
   ``The world knows that Bombay is a center for buying kidneys. I
think it is a shame for us to be so notoriously known,'' said Kisan
Mehta, head of the Life Foundation, a private group that advocates
kidney transplants from cadavers. Indian laws prohibit transplants
from the dead.
   ``But what is ethics to a man who is dying?'' asked Dr. Keshava
Chandra Reddy, a kidney transplant specialist in Madras. The
urologist said he and other surgeons from the Pandalai
Cardiothoracic Foundation have transplanted 485 kidneys in four
years.
   Renal transplants became common in India about seven years ago
when the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin became available locally.
There are no official figures on the number of transplants performed
in India. But since cyclosporin's introduction, at least $7.8
million has changed hands in connection with the estimated 4,000
kidney transplants performed in Bombay, according to Dr. B.N.
Colabawalla, chief of the National Kidney Foundation.

   In another sign of an economic slowdown, the
nation's purchasing managers report that the U.S. manufacturing
economy declined in June for the second straight month.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management said Monday its
Purchasing Managers' Index slumped to 48.8 percent from 49.7 percent
in May. The decline put the index at its lowest level since July
1986 when it was 48 percent. The May decline was the first in 33
months.
   Production by the nation's factories was the only indicator to
increase, while new orders declined for the first time since May
1986 and inventories also fell. Vendor deliveries were faster for
the second month _ a sign of declining demand _ after 31 months in
which they were reported slower.

level was 3.3 percent above the pace of May 1988.
   But private construction remained flat at $335.1 billion at an

<HEAD>Interest Rates Hit Eight-Month Low on Short-Term Treasuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities fell in Monday's auction to the lowest level in eight
months.
   The Treasury Department sold $6.6 billion in three-month bills at
an average discount rate of 7.96 percent, down from 8.07 percent
last week. Another $6.6 billion was sold in six-month bills at an
average discount rate of 7.63 percent, down from 7.78 percent last
week.
   The rates were the lowest since three-month bills sold for 7.82
percent last Nov. 14 and six-month bills averaged 7.48 percent last
Oct. 31.
   The discount rates understate the actual return to investors _
8.24 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for
$9,798.80 and 8.05 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,614.30.
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for 1-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for
making changes in adjustable-rate mortgages, fell to 8.28 percent
last week, down from 8.53 percent the previous week.

<HEAD>New York City, California Pension Fund Managers Urge Changes By Oil
Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of two top public pension funds, which
were successful in forcing recent changes at Exxon Corp., are urging
six major oil companies to alter their policies dealing with
environmental, safety and health issues.
   The two directors, who help manage major pension funds in New
York City and California, delivered their message in joint letters
dated June 30 to Amoco Corp., Ashland Oil Inc., Pennzoil Co.,
Tenneco Inc., Amerada Hess and Kerr-McGee Corp.
   California State Controller Gray Davis, one of the trustees for
the nation's largest public pension fund, and New York City
Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin urged the companies to add an
environmental expert to their boards of directors. They also called
for the creation of a public issues committee to monitor worker
health and safety policies, programs and practices and to recommend
changes.
   The trustees cited the March 24 oil spill involving an Exxon
tanker that dumped millions of gallons of thick crude oil into
pristine Alaskan waters as the catalyst for their latest appeal.
   ``The Exxon Valdez disaster, with its potential impact on
shareholder value, dramatizes the need for energy and chemical
companies, in particular, to aggressively promote effective
environmental and worker health and safety programs,'' the trustees
wrote.
   ``Exxon's prompt decision to meet shareholder concerns by
instituting changes in corporate policy at the board level is a
commendable response to a deplorable event.''
   California and New York joined several other pension funds after
the spill in threatening to attempt an ouster of Exxon management if
the company did not respond to the demands of shareholders
represented by the funds.
   Exxon agreed at its May shareholders meeting to present the
requests to its board.
   Davis is a member of the boards of trustees for the California
Public Employee Retirement System and California's State Teacher's
Retirement System, which hold 11.2 million shares of stock in the
six companies.
   Goldin sits on the boards of five city pension funds with more
than 2.3 million shares of stock in the companies. The funds are the
New York City Employees Retirement System, the Police Pension Fund,
the Fire Department Pension Fund, the Board of Education Retirement
System and the Teachers' Retirement System.

<HEAD>Advertisers Turn to Dead Celebrities For Sales Boost</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's said that dead men don't tell tales, but
advertisers are finding they do boost sales.
   The use of the deceased celebrities to hawk products is on the
rise, as any glance through a magazine or quick look at television
will attest.
   There's the late actor James Dean appearing in ads for sneakers,
baseball legend Babe Ruth selling electronics, Albert Einstein
pushing cameras. Other faces from the past are showing up in
advertisements for greeting cards, banks and computers.
   ``Everyone wants to associate their product with a winner or a
legend,'' said Beth Vahle, vice president of the Curtis Management
Group of Indianapolis, which represents about 50 celebrities, living
and dead.
   After using Ruth a year ago for a limited advertising campaign,
Zenith Electronics Corp. reported that the promotion ``generated
thousands of sales leads.'' The ad featured Ruth at bat, with the
slogan: ``Sometimes A Major Player Can Change The Whole Game.''
   ``We were looking for a symbol of what our customers would
consider a major player,'' said John Taylor, a Zenith spokesman.
``Certainly, Babe Ruth was a major player and a real recognized
image.''
   Athletic shoe maker Converse Inc. decided to use Dean after the
company discovered a poster of Dean, shod in a pair of its Jack
Purcells, relaxing on the set of ``Giant.'' Converse negotiated with
the agency representing Dean's estate and the photographer who took
the picture to use it in advertising.
   Michael S. George, marketing manager for the Interco Inc.
subsidiary, would say only that the company paid ``thousands of
dollars'' to use the moody, black-and-white photo.
   It paid off. George said sales of the Jack Purcells model rose 30
percent to 50 percent in both 1987 and 1988, ``and that's partially
attributable to the advertising.''
   ``The image projected in the photograph is very hip and
nostalgic,'' George said.
   The practice of using yesterday's celebrities to hawk today's
products ``has grown tremendously,'' said Roger Richman, president
of the Roger Richman Agency of Beverly Hills, Calif., which
represents nearly 40 personalities.
   Richman's agency handles the licensing of Sigmund Freud, W.C.
Fields, Marilyn Monroe and Einstein.
   Richman would not discuss revenues, but he said his agency
receives about 35 percent of the royalties generated by such ads.
   In addition to the popularity of the late greats, there are
practical advantages to advertisers using dead celebrities.
   Cost is one, since living personalities usually cost more to use
in an ad than an estate would charge, Mrs. Vahle said.
   Another benefit is concern about reputation. An advertiser using
a dead celebrity to pitch products doesn't have to worry about the
star tarnishing his name through a messy divorce or drug arrest, for
example.
   But at the same time the management agencies are promoting the
use of dead celebrities, they must spend time tracking down
unauthorized appearances from beyond the grave.
   Both Curtis Management and the Richman Agency have gone to court
seeking either to halt unauthorized use of an image or to demand
royalties for the families or estates involved.
   Heirs and representatives of celebrities say they should be paid
a royalty and have some control over how the departed are portrayed.
Mrs. Vahle and others argue that a persona should be considered
property that can be inherited.
   In New York, State Sen. Emanuel R. Gold proposed a bill that
would do just that by making the likeness of a dead person a
property right that can be inherited. The bill was killed last week,
however.
   Fewer than a dozen states have laws to protect the rights of dead
celebrities, and in other states judges have established some rights
through their decisions, said Mark Roesler, Curtis' president.

<HEAD>Pepsico Bags Chips From Former RJR Companies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pepsico Inc. has snapped up two of Britain's
largest potato chip manufacturers from BSN of France in a $1.35
billion cash deal that gives the food and beverage giant a larger
share of the European snack-food market.
   BSN had acquired the companies, Walkers Crisps and Smiths Crisps,
just a month ago as part of its purchase of RJR Nabisco's European
food operations. RJR sold the division to trim some of the debt from
its record $25 billion buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
earlier this year.
   Monday's sale makes Pepsico one of the largest snack-food
producers in Europe at a time when the continent is moving toward
eliminating trade barriers by 1992. It also allows BSN to focus on
its core biscuit and pastry businesses, industry analysts said.
   ``We view the acquisitions of Walkers and Smiths as strategically
important as it will transform the Frito-Lay division of Pepsico
into a worldwide snack-food manufacturer,'' said Lawrence Adelman,
of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Joanna Scharf, of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., agreed: ``They're
investing in a business that they know very well. No one else can do
in this business what they can do.''
   Wall Street wasn't as enthusiastic, however. In composite trading
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Pepsico closed down 12.5
cents at $53.12{ a share.
   Walkers and Smiths are among Britain's largest sellers of potato
chips and snack foods, with sales estimated at $460 million this
year. The United Kingdom is the world's second-largest market for
snack food behind the United States, although per-capita consumption
is only two-thirds of the U.S. rate.
   ``For Pepsico, this acquisition represents a one-time opportunity
to significantly strengthen and expand our international snack-food
business,'' Pepsico Chairman D. Wayne Calloway said.
   ``Smiths and Walkers have a leadership position in the United
Kingdom similar to that of Frito-Lay in the United States.''
   Pepsico, based in Purchase, N.Y., is one of the world's largest
soft drink, fast food and snack-food companies, with sales of $13
billion last year, 37 percent of which came from snack foods.
   Among its well-known businesses are Pepsi-Cola Co., Seven-Up
International, plus the Pizza Hut, Taco Bell and Kentucky Fried
Chicken restaurant chains. Its snack-food operations, which hold a
60 percent market share in the United States, manufactures products
under the Frito-Lay, Doritos and Lays brands.
   BSN, with 1988 sales totaling $7 billion, produces biscuits,
dairy and other grocery products, beer, champagne and mineral water.
   The French company had purchased five RJR businesses, including
Smiths and Walkers, on June 6 for $2.5 billion. BSN said it planned
to keep the other three companies, the United Kingdom biscuit
business of Nabisco Brands; The Belin Group, a French biscuit and
pastry business; and Saiwa, a biscuit and snack producer in Italy.
   Analysts said the Pepsico purchase would dilute 1989 and 1990
earnings per share by about 8 cents each year, but they said that
would be offset by the estimated $490 million in cash surplus
expected this year.
   Adelman said he expects the company to earn between $3.25 and
$3.30 per share this year, and around $3.80 a share in 1989. Pepsico
earned $762.2 million, or $2.90 a share, in 1988.
   ``It appears that what they (Pepsico) paid for this business is
in line with cash flow multiples being paid for good companies,''
said George E. Thompson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities
Inc.
   ``I think that when you put Pepsico together with these companies
... they bought themselves a strong earnings stream over the
intermediate and long term.''

<HEAD>West German IBM Plant Starts Production Of New Computer Chip</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   International Business Machines Corp.
has stepped up production here of a new four-megabit memory chip
critical to the development of the computer giant's most
sophisticated products.
   The Sindelfingen plant, about 15 miles west of Stuttgart, is only
the second plant in the world that will mass produce the complex
semiconductors for IBM, officials said Monday.
   Production-line manufacturing began in Burlington, Vt., ``a few
months ago,'' and another IBM manufacturing plant is scheduled to
open in Yasu, Japan, later this year, according to Peter W. Thonis,
a spokesman at IBM's Armonk, N.Y., headquarters.
   It had been widely assumed that Japan was leading in the battle
to gain early dominance in production of the four-megabit chip, but
industry analysts and IBM note that the U.S. company has been
producing the chip in volume for the past few months.
   ``We have leadership position,'' said Thonis.
   The four-megabit chip, which can store 4 million bits of
information, or about 200 type-written pages of information, is
considered a vital element of virtually all of the advanced
consumer-product and defense technology of tomorrow.
   ``Production of this four-megabit computer chip signals without a
doubt a powerful new phase (in computer) development,'' said West
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who attended the Sindelfingen plant
opening.
   According to Helmut Roeder, a Stuttgart-based IBM spokesman, the
company succeeded in producing the first four-megabit memory chip
from a 200-millimeter silicon wafer. He said the new chip will allow
increased computer memory while keeping down costs.
   ``This can be used for all types of computers,'' he said in a
telephone interview. ``With a larger wafer, it is cheaper and you
have a much higher production output. The objective was to reduce
the cost of memory.''
   Roeder did not say precisely what kind of savings could be
expected from production of the new chip, but he noted that IBM
would not be selling the new chip to other computer producers.
   ``We are planning to use this new chip generation in our own
products,'' he said.
   Other companies have been unable to produce a four-megabit chip
from larger silicon wafers because of the sensitive production
procedures required, Roeder said.
   As it is, he said, it will take about eight weeks before the
first chip of this nature is completed at the Sindelfingen plant.
   ``This process is very difficult. No one else has been in the
position to handle it correctly and economically,'' he said. ``There
are so many processes, so many control mechanisms to make sure each
step is correct. That's why it takes two months.''
   Roeder said he believes some Japanese companies are close to
duplicating IBM's achievement.
   ``We expect there are competitors who are not far behind us,'' he
said.

   Share prices were firmer at midday Tuesday,
although off the day's best levels, with little news to stir the
market out of light trading.
   Traders said there was little incentive to shift existing

   At about noon London time, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was up 9.1 points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,174.7. The
index registered its best level of 2,176.8 by midmorning but slipped

   As golfing booms across the country like
a 275-yard drive zipping down a fairway, Dave Austad knows there's a
lot of golf clubs to be sold.
   And while he's trying to hawk mashies, woods and wedges to an
estimated 23 million U.S. golfers, he figures they'll also need golf
bags, golf balls, at least one glove apiece, shoes, loud clothes and
maybe some fuzzy head covers.
   Austad is president of Sioux Falls-based Austad Co., a mail-order
golf equipment supplier that's one of the biggest in the world. His
father, Oscar Austad, started the business out of the back of his
car in 1963 when he sold polyurethane tubes to protect golf club
shafts.
   The company has since grown into a $50 million-a-year business.
   Golf merchandising is a nearly $8 billion-a-year industry,
according to the National Golf Foundation. Austad Co. says it has
about 2 percent of the $2 billion catalog business in equipment for
the links.
   The company boasts a mailing list of over 2 million names, and
about 26 million catalogs are sent out every year. An average of
61,000 orders a month are taken with $60 as the average price per
order, Austad said.
   So with those kind of numbers and all that golf equipment around,
you'd expect Oscar and Dave can play some stick. But Oscar hasn't
played in 12 years, and Dave's golfing ability is just average.
   ``The story goes, dad would go to a tournament, and when he'd
step up to the tee, everybody would figure this guy is going to kill
the ball,'' said Austad.
   ``He was absolutely so terrible he'd drop three in the water and
everybody would walk away thinking that if he can't hit his own
product, they sure aren't going to buy it.
   ``He decided for the betterment of the company, he should quit
playing.''
   The firm has begun to make a big push in foreign markets, with
the Japanese the big prize of the golf marketing world. In Japan,
golf, like baseball, is fanaticized.
   ``Golf is exploding everywhere,'' Austad said. ``In Japan it is
more than in the U.S. But they're not as accepting of direct mail.''
   Last year, Austad Co. signed an agreement with Mazda Corp. to
sell the automaker clubs and other equipment wholesale that are
sold, in turn, to its workers at discount prices.
   Recently, Austad placed ads in two of Japan's biggest golf
magazines for subscriptions to its catalogs, which have been
translated into Japanese.
   ``We're really just putting our toes in the water right now,'' he
said. ``What we've found surprising is a lot of companies don't want
to go into Japan; they see it as a hassle.''
   The company also is making a move in the retail market. In
addition to its flagship store in Sioux Falls, which sports an
indoor sand trap and a golf video range, a second shop is opening in
Minneapolis.
   ``We see retail growing rapidly,'' said Wayne Steinhauer,
Austad's vice president of customer relations. Many of the company's
customers are in the Minneapolis area, he said.
   That raises the question of location. As one of the sport's
biggest suppliers, some might think the Austad Co. should be near
Pebble Beach, Calif., or Augusta, Ga., both home to golf
championships. But South Dakota?
   ``It hasn't hurt,'' Austad said. ``In the States people think
`South Dakota, these guys have to be honest.' Some people get a
little uncomfortable giving their credit card number over the phone
to somebody in New Jersey.''

   Share prices on the London Stock Exchange rose in
dull trading Tuesday as America's Fourth of July holiday deprived
the market of trading incentives.
   Despite the lack of participation, equities gained some support
from the pound's continued strength on foreign exchange markets.
Dealers said the currency's firming trend helped ease concerns about
the outlook for British interest rates.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was up 8.8 points, or 0.4 percent, at 2,174.4. The index moved in a
narrow range throughout the day, showing a maximum gain of 11.2
points in early trading and a minimum gain of 6.7 points at
mid-morning.
   The narrower Financial Times 30-share index was up 8.7 points at
1800.3.
   The 500-share index finished at 1,236.04, up 4.73.
   Volume, meanwhile, sank to a meager 373.2 million shares from
Monday's 410.8 million shares.
   Dealers said they expect Wednesday also to be a day of light
trading, as a strike by public transportation workers threatens to
halt services on London's buses, subways and trains.
   The market virtually ignored news of the largest-ever monthly
fall in Britain's underlying official reserves, which indicated the
Bank of England intervened heavily to defend the pound in June.
   The Treasury reported that underlying reserves fell by the
equivalent of $2.236 billion. The previous largest fall was in April
1978, when the underlying level fell $2.115 billion.
   In major corporate news, Scottish and Newcastle Breweries made
two acquisitions in the leisure industry. The British brewer took a
65 percent stake in Netherlands-based Center Parcs for 218 million
pounds and it agreed to pay 60 million pounds for the remaining 50
percent of Pontin's Ltd. in Britain.
   Scottish and Newcastle also announced full-year pretax profit
rose 22 percent to 138.2 million pounds and said it is taking steps
to sell its Thistle Hotels unit. The brewer's share price dropped 5
pence to 332.

<HEAD>Dollar Lower in Calm European Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with late prices. Stands for AMs due
to closure of U.S. markets for the holiday.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar ended slightly lower Tuesday in
European trading becalmed by the absence of U.S. traders for a
holiday and the retreat of European players to the sidelines.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Foreign exchange dealers said activity was generally light
because of the U.S. Independence Day holiday. Trading grew
progressively quieter during the afternoon.
   They attributed the overall downward trend of the dollar to
speculation about U.S. interest rates.
   ``The market is figuring that the United States will lower rates
to halt a slowdown in economic growth,'' said a trader at a large
Frankfurt bank.
   He predicted that if that happens, many investors are likely to
flee from dollars into pounds, attracted by an interest rate
differential which is favoring sterling-dominated assets.
   Traders said the dollar managed to firm to 141.55 yen in Europe
as the clouded outlook for Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party
continues to make the yen look vulnerable.
   The party's reputation has been hurt by the Recruit Co. scandal,
a second scandal involving Prime Minister Sousuke Uno's personal
life and its recent electoral losses.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 1.55 yen to close at 140.95 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 141.55 yen.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Monday included 1.9220
West German marks, down from 1.9285; 1.6527 Swiss francs, down from
1.65375; 6.5375 French francs, down from 6.5485; 2.1710 Dutch
guilders, down from 2.1775; 1,393.50 Italian lire, down from
1,400.50; and 1.1935 Canadian dollars, down from 1.19455.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.5870 to buy one pound, more expensive than $1.5775 late Monday.
   Gold traded in London at a late bid price of $376.50 a troy
ounce, up from late Monday's $375.05.
   In Zurich, the late bid price was also $376.50, up from $374.35
late Monday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.38 to close at a bid $378.31.
   Silver was quoted in London at a bid price of $5.24 a troy ounce,
up from Monday's $5.20.

<HEAD>Another Entry in The Vacuum War on Bugs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DELANO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The idea of sucking bugs off crops instead
of spraying them with toxic pesticides is causing a proliferation of
product names playing on the word ``vac,'' as in vacuum.
   It all started last year when Driscoll Strawberry Associates Inc.
of Watsonville designed a machine called a BugVac that uses just
enough suction to remove lygus bugs from the top parts of berry
plants while not disturbing beneficial bugs that congregate farther
down the plant.
   That idea helped spur Salinas-based Tanimura &amp; Antle Inc., the
nation's second-largest lettuce grower, to develop a machine called
Salad-Vac to vacuum bad bugs off lettuce.
   Now comes VAC-US, designed by two men from Delano, 125 miles
north of Los Angeles, for use on grapes and cotton.
   The device consists of a specially designed, five-horsepower
hydraulic fan that collects bugs in wire mesh bags after sucking
them off plants, said Harold Nelson, who designed VAC-US with Don
Neumann, his partner in Daco Farm Supply.
   The 50-pound vacuum units can be mounted in several
configurations on farm equipment to accommodate individual
requirements of farmers, Nelson said.
   He and Neumann have begun field tests of a six-unit,
tractor-mounted implement with three units on each side
hydraulically positioned around a row of grapevines. They think it
could be profitable because the cost of about $20,000 for an
eight-unit VAC-US would be considerably less than that of other
types developed so far.
   A VAC-US unit on top of the vines and one on each side can remove
up to half the flying insects on the plants as the tractor moves
between rows, Nelson said.
   Even though it doesn't eradicate all flying pests in a single
pass, Nelson thinks VAC-US will be valuable as another tool to let
growers rely less on pesticides.
   ``We're not a replacement for chemicals,'' he said. ``We're a
tool to help reduce the amount of chemicals needed. People are
looking at how to reduce pesticides, and this is another concept.''
   However, Nelson thinks repeated vacuumings will remove most
flying insects, and the number of times a grower would need to
vacuum plants depends on a particular insect's life cycle. He
estimated that a single application of pesticides would cost about
as much as three sweeps of a field with VAC-US.
   The device can be used to remove leafhoppers, white flies, moths,
weevils, thrips and lygus bugs from strawberries, grapes and cotton,
he said.
   After flying insects are sucked off the plants, beneficial
predator insects can be introduced to eliminate mites and other
bugs, Nelson said. The wire mesh bags are designed with openings
large enough to allow some surviving predators to escape.

<HEAD>Underwriting Revenue Plunges In First Half Of Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amount of revenue Wall Street firms raised by
underwriting new issues of stock and bonds plunged sharply in the
first half of the year, increasing the financial pressure on
brokerage houses that are still reeling from the 1987 stock market
crash.
   Fees from bringing new stock and bond issues to the market in the
first half dropped 32 percent despite a drop of only about 3 percent
in the volume of these securities, according to Securities Data Co.,
which tracks the performance of Wall Street companies.
   The disparity is due to a 45 percent decline in the volume of
stocks issued; stock issues are much more lucrative for investment
firms than debt issues.
   Total fees charged by investment firms in the first half totaled
$1.38 billion, down from $2.04 billion in the same period of 1988,
Securities Data said.
   The volume of all securities underwritten dropped to $141.6
billion from $145.7 billion in the first half of last year.
   At the same time, the volume of straight-debt issues brought to
market increased to $72 billion, its highest level for the period in
three years. Straight debt excludes mortgage-backed securities and
other debt issues backed by assets.
   Securities Data attributed the growth in debt issues to declining
interest rates and a strong dollar, which made these investments
more attractive.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. Inc. was the leader in all new domestic stock
and bond issues in the first half, underwriting $25.2 billion, the
investment-house research firm said.
   Merrill Lynch raised about 91 percent of this amount through debt
offerings, making it the leading debt underwriter as well.
   In second place overall was Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., which managed
$16.9 billion in new stock and bond issues. First Boston Corp. was a
close third, at $16.3 billion.
   Despite Merrill Lynch's lead, its underwriting fees dropped 33
percent, to $194.4 million from $289.4 million in the first half of
1988. This is due to the fact that most of its underwritings were
debt issues.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert took first place in underwriting fees, at
$256.8 million. Drexel's fees were boosted by the record $149.6
million it earned in helping finance the record leveraged buyout of
RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., a New York
investment firm.
   Boosted by the RJR financing, Drexel ranked first in the
underwriting of junk bonds, or high-yield debt issues, at $6.8
billion out of a total of $14.8 billion issued by all Wall Street
firms. Of Drexel's $6.8 billion, $4 billion was raised for the RJR
deal.
   Merger activity lagged in the first half compared with the first
half of 1988. Announced acquisitions of U.S. targets, valued at $10
million or greater, totaled 695, down from 784 during 1988's first
half. The total value of these planned acquisitions dropped by more
than 20 percent to $164.9 billion from $209.5 billion in the 1988
period.
   Also during the first half, initial public stock offerings
plummeted to $6.1 billion from $12.9 billion in the year-ago period
as the number of companies going public declined to its lowest level
since the second half of 1982, Securities Data said.
   In the first half, only 100 companies registered new stock
offerings compared with 138 in the first half of 1988.

<HEAD>Assets of Brazilian Investor Ordered Sold to Pay American Firm</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The assets of multimillionaire
businessman whose debts led to a recent stock market scandal must be
sold at auction, a judge ruled.
   The investor, Naji Nahas, owes $6.7 million to a U.S. trading
firm. The debt by the Lebanese-born Brazilian citizen forced the
closure of six brokerages and the resignation of the government's
top banker last month.
   Sao Paulo Federal District Court Judge Luis Gomes da Silva has
ordered Nahas' assets ``put on lien for future auctioning to
guarantee payment of $6.7 million'' he owes to a company identified
as Conticommodity Services Inc. of Chicago, a court clerk, who asked
not to be identified, said by phone Tuesday.
   Nahas' assets include his apartment, two properties in Sao Paulo
and shares in Selecta-Comercio e Industria, a holding company that
controls his more than 20 enterprises, the clerk said.
   The clerk said he did not know how much these assets were worth
nor when they would be auctioned.
   Nahas' lawyer, Teofilo Rocha, declined to comment when contacted
by The Associated Press.
   The O Globo newspaper of Rio de Janeiro quoted Rocha as saying he
was waiting for documents from the United States that prove Nahas
paid his debt owed to Conticommodity and that the lien on his assets
should be suspended.
   No listing for Conticommodity could be found in the Chicago
telephone book or in business directories and company officials
could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
   The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has linked Nahas to
Texas billionaires Nelson Bunker and William Herbert Hunt in their
unsuccessful bid to corner the world silver bullion market.
   A year ago, the Brazilian Supreme Court ratified a 1986 verdict
by a New York court that found Nahas guilty of irregularities
committed in the negotiation of 182 silver futures contracts.
   In June, Nahas was the pivot of a scandal that sent Brazilian
stock markets into a tailspin. The scandal broke June 9, when Nahas
failed to cover checks worth $31 million to pay for highly
speculative deals on the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange.
   On June 12, the government shut all of Brazil's stock exchanges
to avoid panic, and Nahas was prohibited from leaving the country.
The markets reopened the next day.
   Six brokerages involved in the scandal were closed and Elmo
Camoes, president of the Central Bank and owner of one of the
brokerages, resigned.
   On June 26, the federal police charged Nahas with two counts of
white-collar crime. Police said the investor in 1987 illegally tried
to take $20,000 to London and in 1983 borrowed the equivalent of $12
million from a bank of which he was a major shareholder, a violation
of Brazilian law.
   If found guilty on these two charges he could be sentenced to up
to 11 years in prison.

receive commission, not a share of profits earned by their recruits.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mary Kay Cosmetics Inc., target of comic strip
barbs over animal testing and jokes about its pink Cadillacs, is
doing nicely, thank you, 3{ years after founders Mary Kay Ash and
her son Richard R. Rogers took the company private in a $469 million
deal.
   Sales have increased 63.1 percent since 1985, the last year the
company was publicly traded, reaching $406 million last year _ all
through the efforts of 185,000 sales ``consultants,'' most of them
women and some of them rich women.
   Since Mrs. Ash founded the company in 1963, 33 consultants have
each been paid more than $1 million in commissions. In February
alone, 10 ``national directors'' earned more than $20,000 each, with
the top director getting $40,303.53.
   Mary Kay has an estimated 2 percent of the cosmetic market, but
claims as much as 9 percent of the skin-care products segment and
about 3.5 percent of the so-called glamour segment _ primarily
makeup.
   The success of Mary Kay's leveraged buyout prompted Vice Chairman
John P. Rochon in May to venture a takeover of competitor Avon
Products Inc., which had $3 billion in mainly door-to-door sales
last year. Avon rejected the offer and Rochon has not broached the
subject publicly again.
   At the time, Rochon said the ``cultures'' of Mary Kay and Avon
would remain distinct, but he said Avon would benefit from a touch
of Mary Kay-style motivation.
   The Mary Kay approach is slogan-filled.
   ``God first, family second, career third;'' ``In business for
yourself, but never by yourself;'' ``The go-give spirit'' are some
of the sayings used to motivate the sales force.
   A monthly magazine is entitled ``Applause,'' and gem-studded
jewelry is given to even new recruits.
   Every year the company stages four sessions in which thousands of
Mary Kay consultants descend on Dallas for a production-number
extravaganza. Top sellers are awarded minks, crowned and throned on
stage at the Dallas Convention Center, and treated to a reception at
Mrs. Ash's pink mansion.
   But it is the cars that have become the company signature.
   Top achievers are given pink Cadillacs to drive for the rest of
their lives, getting a new one every two years as long as they
maintain their high performance. Lesser efforts are rewarded by
smaller cars _ Buicks and Pontiacs.
   There are about a thousand Mary Kay pink Cadillacs on the road,
plus 1,000 Buicks and 3,000 Pontiacs.
   Consultants earn money by selling cosmetics at home presentations
and recruiting other consultants.
   Unlike some direct sale companies, each sales person orders
products directly from Mary Kay, and not from another person one
step up a sales ladder. Consultants do, however, receive commission
based on the sales by their recruits.
   Behind the flamboyance is a detailed program telling consultants
everything from how to set up business and do their accounting to
how they should dress. It provides a detailed code of ethics and
outlines how to win prizes.
   Over this kingdom rules Mary Kay Ash, whose age is a closely
guarded secret, one she wouldn't even reveal to the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   Mrs. Ash, who is recovering from eye surgery and unavailable for
interviews, created the company in 1963 after leaving a firm that
wanted her to move every six months.
   She was angry at her former employer and began cataloging the
problems facing businesswomen.
   ``Mainly, I was doing it to help other women,'' she told one
interviewer.
   But President Richard Bartlett said Ms. Ash realized she really
was creating an outline for a successful company, so she began to
implement it herself, even though some of those ideas ran counter to
accepted management and direct sales theory.
   ``I thought that I knew about party planning when I came here,''
said Bartlett, who spent time at Tupperware Home Products before
joining Mary Kay in 1973. ``Where others were talking fun and games
(at the home visits), she was deadly serious.
   ``I had spent over 15 years learning that you couldn't do those
things, that they wouldn't work,'' he said. ``They do and we
thrive.''
   He cites as examples her decision to limit the size of home
presentations to six people and abandoning the ``party approach''
for a more serious ``skin care class.''
   The company continues to take an adventurous approach to business.
   Although admitting leveraged buyouts can be troublesome and drain
company resources to pay off debt, ``I think we're a shining example
of LBOs,'' Bartlett said.
   Before the LBO, ``We had a tendency to make decisions on what the
shareholders would expect next, or that we thought the analysts
thought,'' Bartlett said.
   ``Now we can take the long view.''
   An example of that view may be the company's decision earlier
this year to stop testing its products on animals.
   The decision followed a long series of ``Bloom County'' comic
strips criticizing Mary Kay's testing, including one that compared
Mrs. Ash to Ayatollah Khomeini.
   It was not ridicule that led to the moratorium, Bartlett said,
but ``the confusion and concern'' shown by Mary Kay's sales force,
which he described as ``a microcosm of American women, middle-class
and up demographically.''
   Bartlett said the moratorium may cost Mary Kay sales, even though
most products planned through next year already have been cleared
   The company also is trying to correct mistakes it made in the
early 1980s.
   ``We got complacent with our product line. We laid back and said
we had the world's finest product,'' Bartlett said.
   The company lost much of its sales force as an improving economy
opened more jobs to women.
   Since then, the Mary Kay pitch has been restructured to appeal to
working women, Bartlett said.
   Part of that plan is to have women in Mary Kay's top management,
and even President Richard Bartlett says a woman should be president
of the company.
   Other than Mrs. Ash, whose official title is chairman emeritus,
most top-level management is male, although there are many female
vice presidents.

<TEXT>
   The European Economic Community said
Tuesday it would begin talks July 7 with Poland, which should be the
last before concluding a trade and cooperation agreement.
   The EEC also said that on July 19 and 20 the EEC will hold the
first round of talks with the Soviet Union, which also are expected
to lead to a trade and cooperation agreement.
   Nico Wegter, external relations spokesman for the EEC's executive
commission, said he expected the agreement with Poland to be signed
before the commission begins its month-long summer break at the end
of July.
   The talks are a result of the mutual recognition pact signed in
June by the EEC and the Moscow-led Comecon trade bloc. Moscow's
partners in Comecon are East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
Hungary, Bulgaria, Vietnam, Cuba and Mongolia.
   Since then, the EEC has signed trade and cooperation agreements
with Czechoslovakia and Hungary and has opened negotiations with
East Germany. The only hitch so far has been the suspension of talks
with Romania, which the EEC said it would only resume if the
Bucharest government improved its human rights record.

<HEAD>Brazil Delays Debt Payment But Denies New Moratorium Planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil, worried about its dwindling cash
reserves, has skipped an $812 million interest payment on its debt.
But the government denied Tuesday that it plans to declare a
moratorium on foreign debt payments.
   Finance Ministry spokeswoman Rosa Alcin said in an interview that
the government had postponed the payment, due Monday, for one week
because of ``operative problems.'' She would not elaborate on the
problems.
   But, Ms. Alcin added, the delay should not be interpreted as the
first step toward a moratorium on Brazil's $112 billion foreign
debt, the largest in the developing world.
   ``A moratorium does not figure in the government's plans,'' she
said.
   Brazil owes about $9 billion to creditors in the so-called Paris
Club, composed of 10 industrialized countries with the greatest
influence in the International Monetary Fund. It was to these
nations that Monday's payment was due.
   In addition, Brazil has a $600 million payment due to private
banks later this month and $3 billion more in September.
   The delay on the current payment comes just as the Central Bank,
Brazil's equivalent of the U.S. Federal Reserve, is attempting to
stem the outflow of money from the country and keep currency
reserves from falling below a critical level.
   On Friday, the Central Bank centralized foreign monetary
operations not only for debt payments but also for export of profit,
dividends and capital by multinational companies that operate in
Brazil.
   According to Central Bank figures, $2 billion was sent abroad by
these means in the first six months, more than the $1.8 billion
transferred in all of 1988.
   At the same time, Brazil has received no new money from abroad,
although it anticipates the release of more than $4 billion promised
by the IMF, the World Bank, private banks, and the so-called
Nakasone Fund created by the Japanese government.
   The major obstacle to the release of these funds has been
Brazil's failure to reach an agreement with the IMF, which is
concerned with the government's inability to control skyrocketing
inflation.
   Inflation was 25 percent in June alone, and totaled 964 percent
in the past 12 months.
   Ms. Alcin reiterated remarks by Finance Minister Mailson da
Nobrega, who said last week that Brazil would maintain interest
payments while able to maintain an ``adequate level of reserves.''
   According to the local financial press, the government considers
the minimum level of reserves to be the equivalent $4.5 billion,
enough to purchase needed imports for three months. The last
official figures divulged showed Brazil had $5.6 billion in reserves
in June.

   The plant, due to open in Shotton in 1992, would bring
much-needed employment to a town where a steel plant closed in 1980

<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers may someday process their soybean
crop into fuel and pour it into their tractors using a formula
developed by scientists trying to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign
oil and find new markets for soybeans.
   The only problem is that it likely will take an energy crisis to
drive the price of petroleum-based fuels high enough to make it
economical to mass produce soybean-oil fuels.
   ``Who knows when another petroleum shortage will push prices up,
making our fuel more competitive?'' said Marvin Bagby, an organic
chemist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Northern Regional
Research Center in Peoria, where the fuel is being developed.
   ``We were close to the cost of diesel in 1983,'' Bagby said in a
recent interview.
   But the price of petroleum-based diesel fuel eventually dropped
below $1 per gallon, making soybean-oil fuel unattractive at its
estimated production price of $1.45 per gallon.
   A number of research laboratories studied the use of
vegetable-oil fuels when oil embargos caused an energy crunch a
decade ago.
   But as petroleum products became available again and fuel prices
dropped, most scientists abandoned the project.
   Bagby and his team persisted, fearing both another embargo and
eventual depletion of the earth's natural resources.
   ``We don't want to be caught unprepared for another embargo,''
said Bernard Freedman, an organic chemist who works with Bagby.
``We're working hard on this because we feel we need to get this
technology in place.
   ``We want to be able to provide farmers with fuel in the case of
an emergency or an embargo comes along again.''
   Ideally, Freedman, said farmers would be self-sufficient in terms
of fuel by growing and producing their own.
   ``We're going to be running out of petroleum, perhaps in 50
years, and this is a renewable resource that we can grow every
year,'' he said. ``We think this is a very important project.''
   Scientists have faced tough challenges converting soybean oil
into a diesel engine fuel: increasing its volatility and reducing
its viscosity, or thickness.
   Bagby said early experiments with vegetable-oil substitutes for
diesel fuel produced ``catastrophic results'' because of their
tendency to thicken and clog mechanical parts.
   ``It formed a solid mass in the crankcase,'' Bagby said. ``To
remove it, you had to take the engine apart and chisel it out.''
   Scientists have since developed four formulas to attack the
viscosity problem.
   Freedman said other nations have successfully mastered
vegetable-oil fuels.
   ``This fuel is being used internationally by a number of
countries including Brazil and South Africa,'' he said. ``Brazil has
a fleet of trucks using soybean oil-based fuel. I think they're
having pretty good luck with it.''
   Freedman said the technology for making soybean-oil fuel is not
new _ it's used by American industry to make vegetable oil and in
the process that produces cosmetics, detergents and specialty-food
products.

   Hyundai Auto Canada Inc. officially opened
its mammoth car assembly plant here Tuesday by announcing it will
build another plant nearby to make body parts.
   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa, who was on hand for the opening,
said the Quebec government will grant the Korean carmaker $5.9
million (U.S.) towards the new $144.4-million parts plant. It is
scheduled to begin stamping parts such as fenders, hoods and roofs
in October 1990.
   The assembly plant, opened to the applause of about 2,000
employees and visitors, produces the Sonata mid-size sedan.
   The first Sonata rolled out Jan. 12, and Hyundai is making about
500 a week. Full production of about 2,000 cars a week or 100,000 a
year is expected to be reached in 1991, said Hyundai spokesman Greg
Young.
   The Bromont plant, about 55 miles east of Montreal, was built at
a cost of $387.7 million, with Quebec and Canadian federal
government subsidies of $131 million. It employs about 800, but that
figure is expected to grow to 1,200 once full production is reached.

<HEAD>Dallas Investor Buying Into Georgia Gulf Corp.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of companies owned by Dallas investor
Harold Simmons has bought an 8.3 percent stake in Georgia Gulf
Corp., an Atlanta-based wholesale chemicals company.
   NL Industries Inc. of Houston and NL Chemicals Inc. of
Hightstown, N.J. acquired more than 2 million shares of Georgia Gulf
in a five-week period, paying $36.38 to $38 per share for a total of
more than $74 million, the companies said Monday in a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.
   Georgia Gulf's stock closed Monday at $39.75, up $1.75.
   A spokesman for Georgia Gulf said it was the company's policy not
to comment on changes in stock ownership.
   Whether Simmons is making a serious play for Georgia Gulf is
unknown, said G. Bryan Dutt, an analyst who follows the company for
Howard, Weil Financial Corp. in New Orleans. ``The only one who
really knows for sure is Harold Simmons,'' Dutt said.
   Based on Simmons' past practice, he added, a takeover attempt is
likely.
   NL Industries' offices were closed Monday for the holiday, and
officials there could not be reached for comment.
   NL Industries is a holding company with most of its business
conducted through NL Chemicals, an international producer and
marketer of chemical products. Simmons is chairman of the board of
NL Industries and a director of NL Chemicals.
   Georgia Gulf, formed in 1984 through a leveraged buyout of
Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s chemical division, went public two years
later.
   Georgia Gulf supplies raw materials to other chemical firms and
to makers of plastic pipe, wood products, paints and fertilizer.
