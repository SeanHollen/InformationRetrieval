   A Greyhound bus driving through a spring
snowstorm overturned and slid down an embankment, injuring 16
people, and in Cincinnati snow fell Sunday for the first time in
May in nearly a century.
   Snow also fell in parts of New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia
and Ohio. In Rochester, N.Y., 10.1 inches of snow fell, breaking
that city's snowfall record for May by more than 6{ inches.
   The unusual spring storm dumped up to 2 inches of icy slush on
this northern Ohio city, and was blamed for the bus accident
Saturday that left three people hospitalized Sunday.
   Thirteen other people, including driver James Rogers Jr., were
treated at two hospitals for minor cuts and bruises and released,
said Highway Patrol Sgt. Dale Meyer.
   Rains and light snow abruptly changed to a heavy mix of snow and
sleet and quickly covered Ohio Route 2 along Lake Erie just west of
Sandusky when the accident occurred around 8:30 p.m. Saturday,
Meyer said.
   ``I've never seen anything like (the weather) last night in
May,'' Meyer said. ``It was an isolated condition, a snow and sleet
downpour. Within a matter of seconds, it seemed like you had two
inches of slush on the road.'' Rogers was trying slow the bus by
downshifting when it spun 180 degrees in the road, flipped onto its
left side and slid gently down the 20-foot road embankment, Meyer
said.
   In Cincinnati, overnight temperatures dipped into the low to
mid-30s. Snow Saturday and Sunday came exactly 91 years after the
city recorded its last measurable snowfall in May.

   The leader of a drug-smuggling cult that
killed 15 people and buried their bodies along the U.S.-Mexican
border ordered his own killing when police closed in on him, two of
his companions said Sunday.
   Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo was shot and killed Saturday after
police appeared outside the Mexico City apartment building where he
was staying with Sara Aldrete and five other alleged cult members.
   Ms. Aldrete, 24, a former honor student at Texas Southmost
College in Brownsville, told reporters Constanzo ordered Alvaro de
Leon Valdez to kill him and his right-hand man, Martin Quintana
Rodriguez.
   Ms. Aldrete, described as the ``witch'' of the cult, de Leon
Valdez and three others arrested after the shootout were presented
to reporters Sunday at the Mexico City Attorney General's office.
They stood behind a 3-by-6-foot table bearing confiscated cult
items, including a skull apparently made of wax and a female doll
holding another doll.
   De Leon Valdez said he shot Constanzo and Quintana with a
machine gun after Constanzo ordered him to do so and hit him when
he resisted.
   ``He went crazy, crazy'' when police came, said de Leon Valdez,
who had had collar-length blond hair and a beard and wore a dirty
white shirt.
   ``He grabbed a bundle of money and threw it and began shooting
out the window,'' he said. ``He said everything, everything was
lost.''
   He quoted Constanzo as saying, ``No one's going to have this
money.''
   Ms. Aldrete said Constanzo ``ordered him to kill him because it
was the end and he wanted to die with Martin.''
   She referred to Constanzo, 26, as El Padrino, or the godfather.
   The bodies of Constanzo and Quintana were found slumped together
inside a tiny closet in the Mexico City apartment. Their shirts
were smeared with blood.
   Ms. Aldrete said she did not see the shooting or the killings of
15 people whose bodies were found on the Santa Elena Ranch outside
Matamoros along the U.S. border in April.
   She said she did not know about those killings until she saw
reports of them on television.
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete are believed to have directed human
sacrifices, mutilations and the boiling of brains and other organs
in rituals to bring occult protection to their drug-smuggling ring.
   De Leon Valdez, 22, said he took part in the killing of Mark
Kilroy, a Texas college student, and of some of the others on the
ranch. But he and Ms. Aldrete indicated Constanzo committed most of
the killings.
   Asked who killed Kilroy, Ms. Aldrete said: ``Adolfo.''
   De Leon Valdez said the young American was killed with a machete
chop to the head. His back was opened to remove his spinal column
for a necklace, he said.
   Appearing calm, Ms. Aldrete said she was sorry about the death
of Kilroy and the others.
   ``I feel sorry because when he disappeared I was trying to help
the (Kilroy) family,'' she said in response to reporters'
questions. She did not explain what she meant.
   ``If I had known it was like this, I wouldn't have been in it,''
she said of the cult.
   Ms. Aldrete told authorities Constanzo invited her to join
``Christian Santeria'' and asked her to use voodoo to help people
with problems, said Abraham Polo Uscanga, deputy city attorney
general. She said Constanzo initiated her into the cult in 1988.
   Santeria is a blend of Catholicism and old African beliefs that
includes animal sacrifices.
   Asked if she was in love with Constanzo, Ms. Aldrete said, ``No,
but I followed him.''
   De Leon Valdez said he met Constanzo while working as a laborer
on a northern Mexico ranch. He said he was ``marked'' for divine
protection in January at a ceremony in Mexico City because he had
killed someone in Matamoros. Pulling back his shirt, he showed
reporters a design of arrows on each upper arm.
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, missing since the first 12 bodies
were uncovered on the ranch April 11, were among 11 people indicted
in the United States on a four-count drug indictment.
   Ms. Aldrete, de Leon Valdez and the others were being held in
Mexico on charges including homicide, criminal association,
wounding a police agent in the arrest, and damage to property, Polo
said.
   Also arrested Saturday were Maria del Rocio Cuevas Guerra, 43,
of Mexico City, who told authorites she loaned Constanzo $2,000;
Omar Francisco Orea, 23, a journalism student at the National
University; and Maria de Lourdes Guero Lopez, 29. The connection of
the latter two was not immediately clear.
   De Leon Valdez said two others involved in the cult were
fugitives.

<HEAD>Art Deco Pioneer Dies Of Complications From AIDS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Industrial designer Leonard Horowitz,
whose eye for color helped transform this city's Art Deco District
into a rainbow of pastel colors and renovated beachfront hotels,
died of complications from AIDS. He was 43.
   Horowitz, who died Friday, saw the potential of buildings that
had weathered through the years when few others could.
   Up to 150 Art Deco buildings in Miami Beach are painted pink,
purple, peach and periwinkle, and about half are Horowitz' designs.
   He founded the Miami Design Preservation League with Barbara
Capitman in 1976. ``Really, he taught me what I know about Art
Deco,'' said Ms. Capitman.
   In 1980, much of the Art Deco District's buildings displayed
weathered, cracked stucco. But Horowitz could see past the peeling
paint, and came up with a scheme for a whole block of buildings
that made them look like confections. The idea caught on.
   Horowitz was born in New York City, and grew up with visions of
the Art Deco-style Radio City Music Hall.
   He started a design firm in New York, but moved to Miami Beach.
He continued doing interior design as well as the Deco district's
colorful exteriors.
   It was not immediately known if Horowitz left survivors. Plans
for a memorial service were pending.

<TEXT>
   Chemical fumes sparked an explosion
in a barge docked for cleaning at this Ohio River town Saturday,
igniting a fire that injured two men and left one missing.
   The barge was empty but apparently contained residues from its
usual cargo of benzene, a flammable chemical solvent, police said.
   Residents within a half-mile of the 3:30 p.m. blaze were asked
to close their windows late Saturday afternoon and evening to avoid
breathing possibly hazardous fumes, said East Liverpool police
Officer Virgil Williams.
   Benzene may produce irritating or toxic gases when burned.
Vapors from the chemical also can cause coughing and lung
irritation, as well as dizziness.
   Williams said the barge had been docked between the Ohio River
and some railroad tracks for cleaning. East Liverpool is in eastern
Ohio.
   ``They were cleaning the barge,'' he said. ``It was empty and
fumes apparently ignited.''
   The blaze was extinguished by the town's Fire Department about
two hours after it began, he said. Firefighters remained at the
scene Saturday evening, wetting down ashes.
   Rescue crews planned to drag the 40-foot-deep river Sunday in
search of the missing man, who disappeared when the blast blew the
hatch off the vessel, said city police Capt. Fred Hyder.
   The two injured men were taken to East Liverpool City Hospital,
where one, Mike Newbrough of Chester, W. Va., was listed in serious
condition with burns, a concussion and fractures, said a nursing
supervisor who refused to identify herself.
   The other victim, Richard Stanley of East Liverpool, also
suffered burns but refused treatment and left the hospital, she
said.
   Hyder said the three men were on the barge looking down into the
hatch when it exploded.
   None of the chemical spilled into the river, Williams said.

   A barge carrying over 2 million gallons of
gasoline struck a buoy Saturday and spilled about 80,000 gallons
into the rain-swollen Hudson River, environmental officials said.
   The leak aboard the Bouchard 45 was stopped and Coast Guard
officials were investigating the cause of the accident, the state
Department of Environmental Conservation said.
   The accident about 30 miles south of Albany was reported about 4
a.m., said DEC regional director Jane Magee. The barge continued
upriver to Ravena after the accident, where workers pumped out some
compartments of the craft and shifted gasoline to other parts of
the barge, she said.
   Getty Oil owns the gasoline, Coast Guard officials said.
   Once the gasoline was shifted, Magee said, the barge was to
continue on to Rensselaer and unload, then return to New York City
for repairs.
   Rain and wind broke up most of the gasoline by Saturday
afternoon, she said. A contractor was hired to clean up the rest of
the spill, Coast Guard officials said.
   ``We're expecting it will have a minimum impact and are
arranging to get some biologists on the river,'' Magee said.

   Only about 50 leather-clad motorcyclists and a
few hundred other peaceable partyers zipped into Zap on Saturday
for the anniversary of the ``Zip to Zap'' party that ended in a
riot 20 years ago.
   ``That makes my day. I love people and I love things happening.
We do have it in order, so I am not worried,'' said Mayor Albert
Sailer said, smiling and waving beneath his blue baseball cap,
which was emblazoned with the slogan ``I Zipped To Zap And Had A
Blast.''
   ``This isn't anything like it was 20 years ago,'' said Mercer
County Sheriff Ron Kessler, who was among the police who tried to
quell the original riot. ``It was a long evening then.''
   Sailer had been told to expect 500 bikers for Zip To Zap II,
which was originally planned as 12 hours of partying and rock music
in one of North Dakota's smaller towns.
   In 1969, this quiet hamlet of 300 people about 90 miles
northwest of Bismarck hosted the first Zip to Zap, an idea hatched
by the editor of the student newspaper at North Dakota State
University.
   It ended in disaster. The National Guard was called in to chase
2,000 drunken revelers out of town. Celebrants set a bonfire in
Main Street and caused about $3,000 in damage before the crowd was
dispersed.
   Saturday's reunion started quietly but livened up as the sun
went down. People began dancing in the street to the blare of
recorded music, and Zap's two bars were jammed. Kessler said the
crowd swelled to more than 500 people.
   Thirty people had been arrested by late Saturday night, mostly
for being too young to drink or for drinking on public property.
Middle-aged people and more than a few locals mingled with the
student crowd.
   The mood was festive, far from a mob scene. There were guest
books for people to sign. Soda pop and hot dogs were for sale
everywhere, although beer was banned in the streets.
   D.J. Guerrero of Fargo, who attended the first Zip to Zap in
1969, remembered that beer prices helped touch off the riot.
   ``It was a mass of humanity out on the streets and everybody was
having a good time, a good time gone sour,'' he said. ``Townspeople
started jacking up the prices on beer and food and everything and
kids got upset. They doubled the price on six-packs of beer.''
   Guerrero, 53, brought his wife and two children to Zap for the
reunion.``They wanted to zip to Zap, so I said OK,'' he said.
   Guerrero was also making amends for what happened in 1969. ``I
apologized to the people here for what happened. The National Guard
... had to save the town. There would have been nothing left here.''
   Alda Peterson transformed her garage just off Main Street into a
mini-cafe, complete with $9 souvenir T-shirts: ``Zip To Zap. We're
Back.''
   The reunion was a good idea, the 64-year-old woman said. ``You
have to let the kids do something, and the older people are just as
nosy.''
   Her son called her from California Friday night, asking if she
was ready for the ``zippers'' and envious that he could not be
home, Mrs. Peterson said.
   ``If everything is kept under control, it would be nice to be an
annual event,'' she said.
   But the denizens of Zap are far from agreement on that idea.
Some wanted the town barricaded Saturday to keep the visitors out,
she said. ``It's a touchy question,'' she said.

   China and the Soviet Union were brothers in
communism, but the first summit since they fell out nearly 30 years
ago will not be a family reunion.
   The Chinese, determined to show independence from their one-time
tutor in revolution, have forced the Soviets to make the overtures
and concessions toward normal relations.
   When Mikhail S. Gorbachev comes to Beijing on May 15, it will be
Deng Xiaoping, the 84-year-old Chinese leader, who plays big
brother, because of both age and his pioneering of economic reforms
the Soviets are just beginning.
   During the past year, Gorbachev pulled Soviet troops out of
Afghanistan, announced unilateral troop withdrawals from the
Chinese border and put pressure on the Soviet ally Vietnam to
withdraw from Cambodia after more than a decade of occupation.
Vietnam has said it will do so by Sept. 30.
   Those actions met China's three conditions for a summit with the
Soviet leader and moved closer to Gorbachev's own goal of reducing
international tension so he can focus on domestic economic problems.
   China agreed to the summit almost grudgingly.
   When Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign minister,
announced the date during a visit to Beijing in February, the
Chinese initially denied it and then issued a confirmation two days
later.
   Ties between the two nations in trade, foreign policy and
cultural exchange were close between 1950 and 1960, but Chinese
leaders say they have no intention of resuming the alliance.
   The main immediate value of the summit for China, which is wary
of an expansionist Vietnam, has been the concessions on Cambodia.
   Diplomatic sources said the Chinese were trying to extract new
pledges even in the final weeks before Gorbachev's arrival.
   Vietnam's withdrawal plan does not include a U.N. peacekeeping
force or establishment of an interim government to oversee
elections. China is said to want both endorsed in the summit
communique.
   Moscow seeks a general statement of principles guiding the
relationship, like the Shanghai Communique signed by President
Richard M. Nixon on his 1972 visit to China.
   ``It's not obligatory'' to mention Cambodia in the communique,
said V.V. Duhin, cultural counsellor at the Soviet Embassy. ``This
document is designed for many years, and Cambodia is a problem of
this year and next year.''
   Igor Rogachev, Soviet deputy foreign minister, slipped into
Beijing quietly in late April, hoping to resolve the matter. A
Western diplomat described it as a ``game of chicken.''
   Animosity and disagreement between the two countries have a long
history. From the 17th century to the early 20th, China and Russia
contended for influence in the vast Asian interior.
   Soviet agents helped organize the Chinese Communist Party in
1921 and gave it assistance, but also tried to dictate strategy in
a way that irked the revolutionaries, especially Mao Tse-tung.
   Josef Stalin thought little of Mao's plan for revolution in the
countryside. The Soviet dictator continued recognizing the
Nationalist Chinese government even as Mao's peasant guerrilla army
was sweeping to victory.
   Friction continued after the Stalin-Mao alliance of 1950. The
Soviets insisted on special rights to ports and railways in
northeastern China in return for military and technological aid,
embarrassing Chinese leaders who claimed to have ended foreign
control.
   The split came in the early 1960s, after the Soviets refused to
back China in its 1959 border conflict with India, would not help
recapture Taiwan from the Nationalists and scrubbed an agreement to
help the Chinese build a nuclear bomb.
   A border dispute led to a brief but bloody clash in 1969.
   Pragmatism took precedence over ideology under Deng, and China
resumed trade and other non-political exchanges with the Soviet
Union.
   Both Gorbachev and Deng like to be seen as international
peacemakers, and both have serious economic and political problems
at home.
   Restless nationalist groups in the Soviet Union have been
demanding autonomy or independence. University students in Beijing
have demonstrated for democracy on an unprecedented scale.
   Deng already has done away with Mao's communes and shelved his
theories of continuous class struggle.
   By meeting Gorbachev, Deng is addressing one of Mao's last
remaining legacies: the Chinese-Soviet estrangement that has
affected the world political map for three decades.

   Passengers and crew on a Mexicana Airlines
plane that had recently dropped off leaking packages of a
radioactive chemical showed no sign of radiation contamination,
officials said Sunday.
   Officials said earlier that an undetermined amount of
molypentachloride, a corrosive that emits low-level beta radiation,
was found in the cargo hold of the plane. Flight 820 landed at
about 10:20 p.m. Saturday.
   But fire communications supervisor Charles Maier said checks
showed the plane wasn't contaminated, nor were the 88 passengers or
eight crew members aboard Flight 820. The plane landed here at
about 10:20 p.m. Saturday.
   Two or three packages of the radioactive material were loaded on
the Boeing 727 at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport for a
previous flight to Mexico, said Sue Gagner, a U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission spokeswoman in Washington.
   The packages were unloaded in Mexico and were found to be
leaking while the plane was en route from Acapulco to Philadelphia,
according to the NRC and police.
   While in flight, the pilot of the airliner radioed to Mexicana
Airlines officials about the leak and airline officials contacted
Philadelphia police, police Cpl. Andrew Chowmentowski said.

   Two bombs exploded near British
patrols overnight, injuring nine soldiers, police said Sunday.
   The Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility for the first
attack, saying it marked Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's 10
years in power. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for
the other explosion.
   In the first bombing, police said the soldiers were in a mobile
patrol at Moybane, near Crossmaglen, close to the south Armagh
border with the Irish Republic on Saturday night when the bomb
exploded in an abandoned house.
   They said one of the five men was seriously hurt by being hurled
through the air with flying debris, and the house was wrecked.
   The five soldiers were airlifted by helicopter to a hospital,
and the area was sealed off to await inspection by daylight in case
of booby traps, police said.
   The IRA said in a statement that it carried out the bombing to
mark Mrs. Thatcher's 10th year in power. On the actual anniversary
on Thursday it said it set off a roadside bomb that day in
Silverbridge near Crossmaglen that kiled one soldier and wounded
three others.
   The second bomb exploded several hours later on Sunday, 12 miles
away at Camlough, County Down, as another mobile patrol was
passing. One soldier was sent to a hospital for treatment and three
others were given first aid, police said.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the mainly Protestant province with the overwhelmingly Roman
Catholic Republic of Ireland.

<TEXT>
   The mayors of Dallas and Fort Worth easily
won re-election Saturday, and San Antonio's former mayor regained
her office by a commanding margin in elections in four Texas cities.
   The least predictable contest all day was in El Paso, where two
City Council members in the six-candidate field will face each
other in a runoff election.
   The campaigns in all four cities failed to inspire much voter
interest.
   In Dallas, with all 299 precincts reporting, Mayor Annette
Strauss had 60,895 votes, or 73 percent, to 17,002, or 20 percent,
for attorney Peter Lesser. Billy Jack Ludwig had 3,510 ballots, or
4 percent, and Marvin Crenshaw had 2,658, or 3 percent.
   Mrs. Strauss, backed by a huge campaign fund and polls showing
widespread support, had been expected to win a second two-year term
in the nation's seventh-largest city. Her main opponent had been
Lesser, who picked up some support from some minority groups that
once backed the incumbent.
   City Secretary Robert Sloan said he expected 15 percent or less
of the city's nearly 500,000 registered voters to cast ballots.
   In San Antonio, former Mayor Lila Cockrell won by 45,300 votes,
or 59 percent, to 24,107, or 31 percent for insurance executive
Carl Mauthe. They were trailed by five other candidates who had no
more than 2 percent of the vote each.
   Ms. Cockrell, who was mayor of San Antonio from 1975 to 1981,
was supported by the man who replaced her, Henry Cisneros, a
leading Hispanic political figure. Cisneros, beset by personal
problems, decided against running for a fifth term.
   Bexar County Elections Administrator Marco A. Gomez predicted an
18 percent voter turnout.
   Fort Worth Mayor Bob Bolen, who faced no serious opposition in
his bid for a fourth two-year term, won with 14,292 votes, or 89
percent.
   He was trailed by Evelyn Williams, who had 1,099 votes, or 7
percent, and Carlos J. Adams, with 656 votes, or 4 percent.
   In El Paso, with all ballots counted, City Council member Suzy
Azar had 16,220 votes, or 31 percent, to 11,930 votes, or 23
percent for Mayor Pro Tem Ed Elsey. The other four candidates did
not receive significant votes.
   Azar and Elsey will face off May 27.
   Mayor Jonathan Rogers was prevented by law from seeking a fifth,
two-year term.

   The San Antonio ballot was the first one in 14 years that didn't
include Cisneros. He was a city councilman for six years before
becoming mayor in 1981.
   Beset by a troubled marriage and his son's ill health, Cisneros
last fall said he wouldn't run again and accepted a job in the
private sector.
   Cisneros briefly reconsidered his re-election decision in
January after San Antonio voters approved a transportation tax to
pay for a domed stadium that he supported. But he decided against
running after Ms. Cockrell's supporters said they would stay behind
her.
   In the Dallas race, Mrs. Strauss, 65, raised $300,000 compared
with Lesser's $16,000. But she spent more than $1 million to be
elected two years ago, when neither was an incumbent.
   ``It certainly is a different campaign,'' said Lorlee Bartos, a
campaign consultant for Mrs. Strauss. ``The races are much less
expensive throughout the city. It's a different economy.''
   The shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers in 1988
clouded Mrs. Strauss' first term. Police blamed city leaders for
not providing enough support to the force, which was also beset by
a congressional investigation into its officers' use of deadly
force. Minority leaders insist on increased citizens review of
police.
   A non-partisan committee appointed by Mrs. Strauss studied the
city's racial problems and this spring recommended redistricting
the City Council. There have never been more than three minority
members on the 11-member council, though the 1990 census is
expected to show that minorities make up more than half the city
population.
   Fort Worth, Dallas and San Antonio have city manager governments
in which the mayor plays a lesser, often ceremonial role. The El
Paso mayor has more power because there is not a city manager.

   A carnival ride malfunctioned Saturday, trapping
eight people upside down 60 feet off the ground for 2{ hours,
police said.
   Two people were hospitalized for treatment of hypothermia, said
Sgt. Richard Calabro of the 100th precinct.
   The riders were stuck in a ``loop-the-loop'' ride, which is
about six stories high, Calabro said.
   Authorities were called about 9:45 p.m. and worked until 12:15
a.m. Sunday to free the riders. Police initially reported 20 people
were trapped.
   The ride is part of a temporary carnival.
   No reason was given for the malfunction.

<HEAD>Japanese Prime Minister Ends Southeast Asian Tour, Hints At His Replacement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Japanese Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita ended his five-nation Southeast Asian tour Sunday and
headed back to Japan to annoint a successor and restore his party's
scandal-ridden image.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service, in a report from the Philippine
capital, said Takeshita hinted he would ask veteran politician
Masayoshi Ito to accept the premiership despite his reluctance to
take the post.
   President Corazon Aquino and other senior Filipino officials
were on hand for a 10-minute farewell ceremony at Manila airport,
where Takeshita received a 19-gun salute before boarding the plane
for Tokyo. There were no speeches.
   Takeshita went ahead with the visit despite his announcement
April 25 that he would resign to take responsibility for a scandal
in which the Recruit Co. is accused of seeking to buy influence
with political donations or stock transactions that yielded huge
profits to politicians, bureaucrats and others.
   On Monday, Takeshita is expected to meet with Ito, a former
foreign minister. Japanese sources say Ito is expected eventually
to accept the appointment if certain conditions are met, though
these are unclear.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service reported Sunday that Takeshita hinted
to Japanese reporters traveling with with him that he would ask Ito
to take the job.
   Kyodo said Takeshita stopped short of mentioning Ito by name but
said ``it is quite natural for a respectable man to win the heart
of the people.''
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party has focused on Ito as a
successor because so many of the party's leaders are tainted by
Recruit donations or stock deals, while Ito as seen as basically
clean.
   But the 75-year-old Ito, chairman of the party's policy-making
Executive Council, has cited his age and heart problems caused by
diabetes as reasons for declining the nomination to be party
president and thus prime minister.
   During his trip, Takeshita also visited Indonesia, Thailand,
Malaysia and Singapore. All five countries he toured are members of
the non-communist Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the major
regional trading bloc.

<HEAD>Abadan Refinery, Once World's Largest, Resumes Exports After 8-Year
Gap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran's Abadan oil refinery, once the
world's largest, resumed exports Saturday after an eight-year gap,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, said a 10,000-ton shipment of
fuel oil from the refinery left Bandar Mahshahr port, but did not
say where it was headed.
   The refinery, located only a few miles from the border with
Iraq, shut down soon after the Iran-Iraq war broke out in September
1980.
   The 3,200-acre complex was heavily shelled by Iraqi artillery
during the war. More than 150 personnel were killed and lost
production was estimated at $9 billion.
   Around 6,000 technicians and specialists started round-the-clock
repair work immediately after a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire
halted the gulf war Aug. 20.
   Production resumed April 1 with an initial capacity of 130,000
barrels a day of oil products, IRNA said.
   Capacity is expected to rise later this year and reach 360,000
barrels a day in the next two to three years. Before the war, the
refinery produced 650,000 barrels a day.
   Following repairs of war damage at Iran's six other refineries,
the country's total refinery capacity is currently estimated at
850,000 barrels a day.

   A mild earthquake jolted Southern California
Saturday night, but there were no immediate reports of injury or
property damage, authorities said.
   The quake struck at 11:07 p.m. and measured 3.7 on the Richter
scale of ground motion, said Robert O'Rourke, spokesman for the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. The temblor was
centered one mile northwest of Brea.
   Telephone banks at the Orange County Sheriff's Department lit up
with calls following the jolt, said Deputy R. Nink.
   ``Everybody said they were feeling it shake a little bit,'' Nink
said. ``We've had maybe 10 or 15 calls. It wasn't anything huge,
but I guess it shook some people up.''
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage.

<HEAD>Report British Boycott Threat To European Missile Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper reported Sunday that the British
government will refuse to negotiate with the Soviet Union on
reducing short-range nuclear missiles in Europe even if the other
15 members of NATO agree to do so.
   The Sunday Telegraph, in a Washington-dated story, said Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher made her views known to President Bush
in diplomatic notes and telephone conversations last week.
   ``Her tough stance on the issue is proving the main obstacle in
the Bush administration's frantic search for a compromise after
West Germany's insistence that negotiations must take place as soon
as possible,'' the newspaper reported.
   It said Mrs. Thatcher called Bush after failing to agree on a
united NATO policy at her meeting with West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl on April 30.
   At that meeting in West Germany, Mrs. Thatcher failed to
persuade Kohl to abandon his quest for early talks with Moscow on
reducing the missiles. The British leader argued that the 88 Lance
missiles should be modernized, not removed, and that their
reduction or removal would put Europe in greater danger of sudden
nuclear war involving strategic nuclear missiles.
   The Sunday Telegraph said Britain and the United States want to
update the Lance because of Soviet modernization of short-range
nuclear armory and Soviet superiority in conventional and chemical
weapons.

   The ringleader of a drug-smuggling
cult that killed 15 people was slain in a gunbattle with Mexico
City police Saturday, and his girlfriend, the alleged ``high
priestess,'' was captured, police said.
   Cameron County sheriff's Lt. George Gavito said Mexican
authorities told U.S. investigators Saturday night that cult leader
Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, was killed and that police have
arrested Sara Aldrete, a 24-year-old former Texas college student
described as the ``witch'' of the cult.
   The government-run Notimex news agency reported early Sunday
that unidentified officials in the attorney general's office had
confirmed the killing and the arrest.
   Alleged cult member Martin Quintana Rodriguez also was killed in
the shootout at a Mexico City residence about 4:30 p.m., said
Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez. Three other people believed to
be cult members were also arrested.
   Constanzo, the alleged ``godfather,'' and Aldrete had been
sought in an international manhunt and are believed to have
masterminded the activities of the cult that killed 15 people in a
series of ritualistic sacrifices and drug-related slayings.
   Gavito said he spoke on the telephone with Ms. Aldrete, who is
in police custody in Mexico City, for about five minutes Saturday
night, but he would not divulge details of the conversation.
   The attorney general's office in Mexico's Federal District would
not immediately confirm the story, but said he would discuss the
details at a news conference Sunday.
   Constanzo, 26, and Ms. Aldrete, 24, had been charged with
aggravated kidnapping by Cameron County authorities and are
believed to have directed human sacrifices, mutilations and the
boiling of brains and other organs in rituals to bring occult
protection for their drug-smuggling ring.
   The ring and its macabre activities was discovered when
authorities unearthed 15 bodies buried west of the border city of
Matamoros, Mexico, beginning on April 11.
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete, missing since the first 12 bodies
were uncovered April 11, are among 11 people indicted in the United
States on a four-count drug indictment.
   Four of the five men in custody in Matamoros said the cult
leaders were Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete. The pair flew from McAllen
to Mexico City on April 11, officials have said.
   In the Mexican capital, the investigation led to searches of
residences where occult altars were found.

   Atlantis' five astronauts awoke to
music from the movie ``Rocky'' on Sunday, the final full day of
their shuttle mission in which they deployed a planetary probe now
bound for Venus.
   The Magellan probe continued on its 15-month voyage to Venus at
a rate of about 6,500 mph. The spacecraft, launched from the
shuttle's cargo bay Thursday night, already had traveled more than
430,000 miles by early Sunday morning.
   Later Sunday, shuttle commander David Walker and pilot Ronald
Grabe planned to run through a series of tests to make sure the
shuttle's computers and control jets are ready for the fiery plunge
through the Earth's atmosphere on Monday.
   Atlantis, which blasted away from Kennedy Space Center on
Thursday, is scheduled to end its four-day mission with a landing
at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., at 12:43 p.m. California time.
   Also Sunday, the astronauts planned to try to photograph
lightning strikes at night and work on a metals processing
experiment as well as pack their belongings in preparation for the
return home.
   The workload on the four-day flight has been limited because the
Magellan probe and its rocket booster, which together weighed
45,000 pounds, did not allow for many experiments to be carried
aboard.

   Tens of thousands of workers rallied in
central Athens and marched on Parliament on Sunday in a May Day
celebration that was delayed six days because of Orthodox Christian
Easter.
   More than 300 Turkish and Kurdish refugees held their own
demonstration and marched to the Turkish Embassy where they burned
that country's flag.
   They were protesting the death of an 18-year-old worker during
violent unauthorized May Day demonstrations in Istanbul last week.
   More than 100 riot police prevented the demonstrators, who
chanted ``Death to the fascist Turkish regime!'' from approaching
the embassy.
   There are about 700 Turkish and Kurdish political refugees
living in Athens. The Kurds belong to an outlawed movement that
seeks the formation of an independent Kurdish state in southeastern
Turkey.
   The May Day celebration, organized by the General Confederation
of Greek Workers, was the first unified workers' gathering in more
than four years.
   ``On a day like this our various views, ideological differences
and political choices are put aside under the joint goal that
brings workers together,'' said Lambros Kanellopoulos, the group's
Socialist president.
   The confederation, which represents most of Greece's 3.5 million
workers, was bitterly divided after its pro-government socialist
leadership pushed for support of an austerity policy in 1985.
   Support for the two-year austerity policy, imposed by the
governing Panhellenic Socialist Movement, was opposed by radical
socialist and communist labor leaders who split the confederation.
But working under a new, more moderate leadership, those
differences have since been resolved.
   The confederation issued a resolution Sunday calling on the
government for wage increases linked to the inflation rate and a
reduction of the workweek from 37.5 hours to 35. Inflation in
Greece was running at 14 percent at the end of 1988, the highest in
the 12-nation European Economic Community.

   A crewman was killed and two of his companions were

Shimotsu port in western Japan, the Maritime Safety Agency said
Sunday.
   The agency, Japan's coast guard, said the South Korean sailor
who died, Chon In-su, 39, entered a hold aboard the ship Saturday
night to measure what he thought were residual amounts of benzene.
   When he fell to the floor, a colleague, Ok Nam-suk, 52, put on a
mask and went to help, but he also collapsed, the agency said. A
third sailor, Yun Won-sup, 23, rescued Ok but became ill before he
could bring out Chon.
   Japanese rescuers brought out Chon 30 minutes later, but he died.
   The agency was investigating the cause of the accident aboard
the 687-ton Modern Marine, which arrived Saturday with a cargo of
benzene from China.

   The Foreign Ministry on Sunday denied Iraqi reports
that France is negotiating with Iraq about a plan to rebuild a
nuclear power plant destroyed by Israeli warplanes in 1981.
   The ministry spokesman, who under French rules may not be
identified, denied a statement attributed by a Sharjah newspaper to
Hussein Kamal, Iraq's minister of industry and military production.
   The newspaper, Al-Khaleej, quoted Kamal as saying: ``Iraq is
determined to rebuild the Tamouz nuclear reactor for peaceful
purposes and negotiations for this purpose have started with
France.'' Kamal was quoted as saying Iraq has no intention of
manufacturing or possessing nuclear weapons.
   The ministry spokesman said the problem of rebuilding the
reactor has been brought up in the past by Iraqi authorities and
was brought up again recently. But he said: ``There are not any
talks on this subject at the present time.''
   Israeli warplanes destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor at
Tamouz, outside Baghdad, in 1981, saying it could be used to build
nuclear weapons.
   Israel recently accused Iraq of attempting to develop a nuclear
warhead capable of hitting Israeli territory.

   A strong earthquake Sunday struck a region of
southwest China where 730 people were killed by a temblor in
November, but this time officials said only about 10 people were
injured.
   Sunday's quake collapsed some houses and opened rifts in some
streets in Gengma County in Yunnan province, the official Xinhua
News Agency said.
   Xinhua said there were no reports of deaths or injuries, but the
Central Seismology Bureau in Beijing quoted local authorities as
saying about 10 people were injured, four seriously.
   The quake measured 6.3 on the Richter scale, signifying a quake
capable of causing severe damage. The Nov. 6 quake that shook
Gengma and devastated nearby counties was more than 10 times
stronger, measuring 7.6.
   That quake, China's worst in 12 years, destroyed several
villages in Menglian and Lancang counties, 90 miles south of
Gengma. Xinhua said Menglian and Lancang were shaken by the new
quake that hit at 9:38 a.m. Sunday.
   All three counties are in a remote mountainous region near the
Burmese border that is prone to quakes. Gengma is largely inhabited
by members of the Va and Dai minorities, most of whom farm.
   More than 1,300 aftershocks were recorded in less than two weeks
after the Nov. 6 quake. Seismologists said after that quake that
the region had entered a new period of quake activity.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
Each increase of a digit indicates a 10-fold increase in severity.

   Sixteen Chinese laborers died last month after
eating industrial salt at a construction site canteen in the far
northwest province of Xinjiang, according to a local newspaper.
   Another 25 laborers received food poisoning in the April 25
incident in Jeminay county, 280 miles north of the provincial
capital of Urumqi, but were out of danger, according to the May 1
issue of Xinjiang Daily.
   Xinjiang is an autonomous region of the Moslem Uygur minority,
but the report said all of the poisoned workers were ethnic Han
Chinese.
   The story did not say how the salt wound up in the canteen and
its food. Authorities were investigating the incident.

<TEXT>
   French Premier Michel Rocard on
Sunday said elections in this territory will proceed as planned,
reversing an earlier decision to cancel them because of the
slayings of two independence leaders.
   Rocard was among an estimated 5,000 people who attended the
funerals Sunday of Jean-Marie Tjibaou, leader of the Kanak
Socialist National Liberation Front, and Tjibaou's top assistant,
Yeiwene Yeiwene.
   The two were shot and killed on the island of Ouvea on Thursday
by Djubelly Wea, a hard-line separatist opposed to Tjibaou's
moderate policies. Wea was killed by Tjibaou's bodyguards after the
attack.
   Andre Tangopi, another hard-line separatist, was charged in both
shooting deaths but police did not say what role he played in the
attack. He was wounded in an exchange of gunfire that followed the
assassinations and was hospitalized under police guard in Noumea,
the provincial capital.
   Rocard on Friday had postponed the elections in the restive
territory after the slayings. On Sunday, he said they would proceed
as planned June 11.
   ``A criminal doesn't stop the course of peace in progress,'' the
premier said. ``Tolerance will not abdicate in the face of
fanaticism.''
   Last year, Tjibaou abandoned demands for immediate independence
in the territory and signed an agreement in Paris for a peace
process that would end in 1998 with a referendum on independence.
   Many of Tjibaou's followers were unhappy with the accord, which
was aimed at ending three years of sporadic separatist violence
here.
   Tjibaou and Yeiwene had gone to Ouvea to take part in ceremonies
marking the first anniversary of the assault by French police on a
cave where separatists were holding more than 20 other French
officers hostage. The fighting left 19 separatists and two
policemen dead.
   Native Melanesians, known as Kanaks, make up 43 percent of the
inhabitants of New Caledonia, an archipelago 1,000 miles off the
coast of Australia. Most Kanaks favor independence. European
settlers and their descendants make up 37 percent of the population
and most want to remain French.
   The rest of the population is Polynesians and Asians, most of
whom also favor remaining French.

<HEAD>Baker To Seek Soviet Help In Middle East On First Trip To Moscow</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is about
to launch his first diplomatic venture on Soviet soil with an
appeal for superpower cooperation in Central America and the Middle
East and a challenge to Mikhail S. Gorbachev to make his ``new
thinking'' a reality.
   Baker also will propose that the superpowers resume in June
their work on a treaty to reduce long-range nuclear weapons by
30-to-50 percent.
   But his focus primarily will be on regional problems that a
close aide on Friday said were growing to ``frightening''
proportions.
   Baker will ask the Soviets to join the Untied States in backing
direct negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis and to curb
the $500 million in military aid Moscow gave to Nicaragua's Marxist
government last year.
   Baker, who held his first meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze in March in Vienna, has never been to the
Soviet Union in private or public life.
   The trip to Moscow also will be the first for Robert M. Gates,
the deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who will
accompany Baker along with officials of the Pentagon, the State
Department and the National Security Council.
   One of the issues projected for discussion in Moscow is a joint
approach to terrorism. Baker hopes to persuade the Soviets to end
financial support to countries that sponsor terrorism. A group of
U.S. experts is planning to go to Moscow later in the spring for
further talks.
   Baker set the tone for his trip in a speech Thursday in
Washington in which he contrasted the ``new thinking'' that has
marked the Gorbachev era with `'the reality of both Soviet
capabilities and actions.''
   He said the Soviets continue to pose a significant military
threat to Western interests and sought to minimize Gorbachev's
unilateral force reductions in Eastern Europe as still leaving the
Warsaw Pact with a 2-to-1 edge in tanks and artillery.
   Baker also said it was too early to tell whether Gorbachev's
restructuring of the economy, known as perestroika, will succeed.
   Baker's schedule will give him high visibility. Besides meetings
with Shevardnadze on Wednesday and Thursday mornings and a two-hour
session with Gorbachev Thursday afternoon, several public events
are planned to enhance his knowledge of Soviet affairs and get his
views across to the Soviet people.
   These include an interview on Soviet television, meetings with
Soviet parliamentarians and Jewish dissidents, and an inspection of
the U.S. embassy in Moscow that will revive allegations the Soviets
planted eavesdropping devices.
   Baker flies to Helsinki on Monday morning and relaxes there and
meets with Finnish officials until his departure for Moscow on
Wednesday morning. On his way home he will stop in Brussels to
brief Western allies at NATO headquarters.
   This also will provide an opportunity to try to resolve a
dispute with West Germany over short-range nuclear missiles.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is resisting U.S. and British demands that
the Lance's range be extended to more than 250 miles. The German
leader wants U.S. negotiations with the Soviets to reduce
short-range weapons on both sides.
   President Bush and Baker have rejected the demands as a mistake,
but may be losing ground as other countries in the 16-nation
alliance tilt toward the West German position.
   The U.S. hope is to resolve the dispute before Bush and Baker
attend a NATO summit meeting in the Belgian capital with the NATO
partners May 29-30.
   On another arms control front, however, the administration seeks
a resumption of talks.
   U.S. officials said Friday that Baker would propose in Moscow
that negotiations to sharply reduce strategic nuclear weapons be
reopened in Geneva the week of June 18 and basically pick up where
they left off last November when they were recessed.
   But Baker will not outline to the Soviet Union the position the
United States intends to take on specific issues once the
bargaining resumes, said the officials, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.
   ``Essentially, we are looking for continuinity and keeping arms
control on a fast track,'' an official said.
   The Reagan administration had tentatively decided to resume the
negotiations in mid-February. But Bush, after taking office in
January, ordered a delay for a review, now complete, of U.S. arms
control and weapons policies.

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday
denounced a call by an Iranian official to kill Westerners in
retaliation for Palestinian deaths in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   ``I reject this call in its totality,'' Arafat told reporters in
a news conference at Palestine Liberation Organization headquarters.
   On Friday, Iranian Parliament speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani called
for five Britons, French or Americans to be executed for every
Palestinian killed in the Gaza Strip or West Bank by the Israeli
army.
   The statement brought immediate condemnation from Washington,
London and Paris.
   More than 460 Palestinians have been killed since the
Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip began in December 1987.
   The PLO leader called on the international community ``to act
rapidly to put an end to the crimes and the massacres perpetrated
by Israel against the population of the occupied territories.''
   On Nov. 15, the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament-in-exile, decided to recognize Israel, renounce
terrorism and work toward peace based on two separate states,
Israel and Palestine. Arafat announced the peace initiative in a
December U.N. session in Geneva.
   Asked if he planned to withdraw his peace initiative because of
the deteriorating situation in the territories, Arafat said: ``It
is an initiative of the Palestine National Council and it is not up
to me to modify it.''
   The initiative, along with further statements by Arafat to
clarify the PLO's intention, led to U.S.-PLO talks in Tunis, the
headquarters of the Palestine provisional government. Robert H.
Pelletreau Jr., the U.S. ambassador to Tunisia, met twice with a
four-man Palestinian delegation, in December and in March.

elects a civilian president in 1992.
   ``I think I should. I had to do a job. ... I have done the

   The last civilian government under President Shehu Shagari was
overthrown by the army on Dec. 31, 1983.
   Babangida said Nigeria is going through a transition from

   Nigeria is expected to elect a civilian president in October
1992.

<HEAD>Black Newspaper Welcomes Plan to Include Blacks in Parliament</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Arica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The country's largest black
newspaper Sunday welcomed a Cabinet minister's proposal to include
blacks in Parliament, saying the government ``has finally seen the
light.''
   City Press described a speech in Parliament last week by
Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis as ``possibly the
most significant policy statement'' ever by a senior government
official.
   Heunis, however, made clear that the governing National Party
would oppose any system in which white interests could be overruled.
   Heunis, outlining the National Party's latest constitutional
strategy, said the black majority should have a role in the
Cabinet, in Parliament and in the election of a president. He said
the government might allow South Africans to participate in
political structures that transcend racial lines.
   ``Strange but true,'' said a City Press editorial. ``The
government has finally seen the light _ realizing the need to
establish an authentic Parliament that will represent all South
African communities.''
   South Africa's 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. Parliament has chambers for Asians and people of
mixed-race, but the constitution gives almost total power to the
party that wins the most votes among the 5 million whites.
   Militant anti-apartheid leaders, committed to the concept of
one-person, one-vote, have ignored Heunis' speech. But mainstream
white newspapers Sunday joined City Press in depicting it as a
milestone.
   The Sunday Times, the country's largest-selling newspaper,
described the speech as a ``dramatic U-turn'' and ``one of the most
important policy shifts of the past decade.''
   ``The government has accepted that South Africans be allowed to
choose their own political and social groupings, irrespective of
race,'' said The Sunday Times. ``The stand contradicts South
Africa's classical apartheid dogma which holds that all South
Africans must exercise their political and social rights through
the group to which they belong.''
   Rapport, a pro-government, Afrikaans newspaper, ran a front-page
banner headline saying: ``Now: One Parliament.'' The accompanying
article evoked the image of ``a united South Africa where all _
white, black, brown and Indian _ can be represented in one Cabinet
and one Parliament.''
   John MacLennon, a political writer for the Argus newspaper
group, said Heunis' speech suggested the National Party would
forsake the votes of far-right whites during the campaign leading
to general elections Sept. 6. He said the Nationalists will adopt a
pro-reform platform aimed at whites who favor change but not
majority rule.
   The far-right Conservative Party said Heunis' plan would lead
swiftly to black domination.
   The anti-apartheid Democratic Party, which hopes to replace the
Conservatives as the largest white opposition faction in
Parliament, called Heunis' speech promising but questioned whether
the rhetoric could be converted into law.
   City Press also expressed caution, saying blacks ``have been let
down time and time again by people who make promises and never live
up to them.''

<HEAD>Nuclear Power Taking Key Role In Bush Energy Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nuclear power, new technologies and a closer
eye on the environment are emerging as key elements of what a
senior Energy Department official says will be ``the first real
national energy policy this country has ever had.''
   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins has told Congress he'll have
an energy plan ready by next April, although there are indications
this target may be missed.
   Watkins and his chief deputy, Henson Moore, have appeared before
several key industry groups recently to sketch in some of the key
contours of what Watkins says will be a ``common sense approach''
to putting America on a more solid energy foundation.
   Some of the main areas of emphasis will be familiar: greater
leeway for oil companies to explore on federal lands, tax breaks
for oil drillers, decontrol of natural gas prices, expansion of
nuclear power and pursuit of basic research.
   More novel will be the Energy Department's pursuit of what
Watkins calls ``technology transfer'' _ ensuring that energy
research advances made in the department's national scientific
laboratories are made available to industry and universities. The
labs' main focus is on top-secret nuclear weapons programs, but
Watkins said they have done extensive work in unclassified energy
areas.
   Watkins also has said his energy strategy will be more
comprehensive than anything produced during the Reagan
administration. It will take into account, for example, the links
between energy and the environment, including acid rain and the
global atmospheric warming trend caused mainly by burning of fossil
fuels, he said.
   Moore has billed the evolving strategy as a clear departure from
past policies.
   ``We're going to fashion the first real national energy policy
this country has ever had,'' the former Louisiana congressman said
at his swearing-in ceremony April 20.
   The government has produced many energy policies in the past,
but Moore's remark seemed to reflect the fact that the Reagan
administration's policy suffered from criticism by
environmentalists and a lack of interest by the general public.
   ``You could ask 100 people if the country had an energy policy
and 99 would say `no,''' Donald Hodel, the energy secretary from
1982-85, said in a telephone interview. He said there was a policy
but that it was not commonly recognized.
   Watkins, an engineer by training and a career naval officer,
wants to broaden the scope of the government's energy involvement.
Beyond the traditional issues of energy production, price and
supply, Watkins sees room for his department to help stimulate
young people's interest in science, math and engineering _ areas of
education that he says are vital to the nation's energy future.
   This is where the nuclear issue fits in. Watkins is a devoted
supporter of commercial nuclear power, and he is troubled at the
depth of public distrust of this energy source, which accounts for
nearly one-fifth of all electricity generation.
   No orders for new nuclear plants have been placed in 11 years
and none are expected for the rest of the century. Scores of plants
have been cancelled in the past decade, and nuclear's share of
energy production is projected to fall in the 1990s. The Reagan
administration supported nuclear power but failed to revive it.
   This has produced two results that Watkins says threaten the
nation's long-term energy security: a shrinking energy base and a
deterioration of nuclear expertise.
   This is part of Watkins' motivation for launching a publicity
campaign against New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's plan to tear down the
Shoreham nuclear plant on Long Island, which earlier this month was
cleared for startup by federal regulators.
   ``Because Shoreham is the right energy source at the right time
for the right place, its operation should stand as a symbol of the
promise and potential of nuclear power in America,'' Watkins said
after the plant got its license.
   Cuomo wants to tear it down because of doubts about whether Long
Islanders could safety evacuate in the event of an accident.
Watkins has vowed to fight the dismantlement.
   Watkins is taking an analogous approach to the problem of a
slumping oil industry, whose prospects for long-term revival have
been damaged by the Exxon Valdez oil spill. As a result of that
accident _ the biggest spill in U.S. history _ industry hopes for
expanding exploration on the North Slope have diminished.
   Watkins has expressed alarm at the decline in U.S. oil
production since 1986, which has coincided with a rise in oil use
and a resulting jump in oil imports.
   Besides making the country more reliable on oil from the Middle
East, the domestic oil slump has weakened young people's interest
in learning the business, he said. Watkins recently cited figures
showing that between 1982 and 1987 the number of freshmen enrolled
in petroleum engineering schools plunged from 3,300 to 271.
   ``Let us at least be forward thinking enough to prepare
America's young people to be part of the energy breakthroughs of
the next century,'' Watkins said.
   The technological advances that Watkins thinks are most
important include:
   _A ``clean coal'' method of burning the nation's most abundant
energy source in ways that provide more power with less pollution.
The department plans to spend $5 billion through 1992 on
demonstration projects by private companies.
   _New designs for nuclear reactors to reduce their vulnerability
to meltdowns or other serious accidents that have eroded public
confidence in the industry. Numerous such ``passively safe''
designs are under development.
   _A superconducting super collider. Watkins says he will push for
federal financing of the $5.9 billion physics installation in Texas
at which scientists plan to explore the fundamental components of
matter and energy.

<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 400 people trudged in out of a
pounding rain one recent night to hoot and holler at the city's
favorite spectator sport.
   Politics.
   ``Politics is like baseball in Jersey City, and it's hardball
all the time,'' said Thomas Mansheim, chairman of the Department of
Urban Studies at St. Peter's College. ``People are interested in
it, they follow it and a lot of times their jobs are dependent on
it, so they really live for it.''
   This year, it's politics as unusual in Jersey City, an
industrial waterfront city of 230,000 that sits a stone's throw
from the Statue of Liberty on the western shore of New York Harbor.
   A record 10 candidates are running for mayor in Tuesday's
free-for-all. If no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the
vote, the top two finishers will spend another month hurling
epithets until a June 13 runoff.
   The election is non-partisan, but a registered Democrat likely
will win since Democrats have outnumbered Republicans as long as
anyone can remember. Today the ratio is 13-to-1.
   The lineup of candidates includes the incumbent, two former
mayors, four city councilmen, a banker, a police officer and an
insurance broker.
   Decorum is not their best quality.
   Lofty promises of political reform are met with sarcasm, often
sparking hearty guffaws from voters. And biting attacks abound
among the candidates.
   In campaign advertisements, one candidate refers to his
opponents as ``political hacks.'' Another says he's fighting ``The
Corrupt Political Machine.''
   Based on each camp's estimates, more than $3 million will be
spent to capture the $65,000-a-year job. Jersey City's mayor
influences spending of about $400 million-plus in public funds, and
has final say-so on filling approximately 6,500 city jobs.
   Just last Tuesday, a federal judge took note of the city's
patronage system, blasting incumbent Mayor Anthony Cucci for
running a ``spoils system'' that punished public employees who
didn't support his 1985 election bid.
   ``His attempts to persuade the court that a new breeze blew into
City Hall on July 1, 1985, ... (are) unavailing,'' U.S. District
Judge Harold A. Ackerman said. He ruled that a police officer was
illegally demoted for supporting then-Mayor Gerald McCann instead
of Cucci in 1985.
   ``The air was fetid,'' added Ackerman. ``It was sadly, business
as usual in Jersey City.''
   Battling the party machine and the old-time political bosses has
become the common theme of this year's mayoral fight, as the
candidates go after an electorate changed by an influx of
upper-income executives and minority groups.
   It used to be that candidates only had to reach out to the
Italian and Irish strongholds in the city.
   But as the city changed, so did politics. It is estimated there
are 15,000 people from India, 20,000 Filipinos and 10,000 Egyptians
in the city, although it's unclear how many of those people are
registered voters. An estimated 20,000 Hispanic and 25,000 black
residents are registered to vote.
   For the first time, a black, Council President Glenn Cunningham,
is considered a serious mayoral contender.
   The campaign has stirred all the emotions of a tight baseball
pennent race, which was at no time more apparent than on the rainy
night of the city's first mayoral debate. Four-hundred screaming
supporters crammed into a room at Jersey City Community College to
hear nine of the candidates take potshots at each other.
   Mansheim said he sees Cucci, McCann, Cunningham and two-term
Councilman Thomas Fricchione as the four most likely candidates to
make it to the runoff election.
   The others, he said, are running not to win the mayor's seat,
but to win influence.
   ``That's a major part of the reason for running for mayor,''
Mansheim said. ``Even if they don't have a chance, they'll
negotiate, for jobs mostly. It's not winner-take-all in Jersey City
by a longshot.''

   Guy Williams, the actor who
played Zorro in the popular 1950s television series of the same
name, apparently suffered a heart attack and died in his apartment,
police said Sunday. He was 65.
   Williams' body was found at his home in the exclusive
residential neighborhood of La Recoleta. He apparently died about a
week ago, the government news agency Telam reported.
   Police were called to the scene Saturday night by neighbors
complaining of an odor coming from the apartment. An investigation
was begun to confirm the cause of death.
   Williams' real name was Armando Catalano. He was born in New
York.
   ``Zorro'' recounted the adventures of Diego de la Vega, a
dashing young aristocrat in colonial Mexico who stood up for the
rights of his countrymen against the abuses of Spanish overlords.
   Williams also starred as professor John Robinson in the 1960s
show ``Lost in Space,'' portraying the leader of a family marooned
in space.
   Williams was a frequent visitor to this South America capital
and had apparently lived here alone for the past several months.
   There was no immediate word on survivors or funeral arrangements.

<HEAD>Eastern Advertises for Mechanics; Union Says It's a Ploy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Airlines began advertising for mechanics
Sunday, but Machinists union officials said the ads were merely
ploys to lure striking mechanics over the picket line.
   ``All of it is for purely psychological reasons,'' said Jim
Lewis, treasurer of Machinists Local 702. ``It's the same stuff
they've been doing for years here: `See if we can beat them down.'
''
   Eastern took out ads in newspapers in 10 cities Sunday seeking
mechanics to replace Machinists union members who have been on
strike since March 4.
   The Miami-based carrier was almost grounded when pilots honored
picket lines, and the airline filed for bankruptcy protection four
days into the strike.
   The airline started hiring new pilots in the strike's first
month and had added 264 as of Friday. Two pilots have already
completed training; the rest are still being trained. The airline
also has begin hiring and trining new flight attendants.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said wages offered new mechanics
will range from $10 to $18 an hour. That is about what the company
was paying the Machinists when the union struck, refusing wage cuts
of more than a third for some members.
   The newspaper ads say: ``Understand that given the current
strike ... your assignment at Eastern may require you to perform
services or replace employees involved in a labor dispute. But also
understand that this is an unprecedented opportunity for growth and
success.''
   Matell said the company expects many inquiries from experienced
mechanics.
   Lewis said it's unlikely Eastern will be able to hire qualified
mechanics because other major carriers who are hiring mechanics
offer more stability and better wages.
   ``They would get people who have been rejected by the other
carriers,'' he said.
   Lewis said handfuls of strikers ``have dribbled across'' the
picket lines with the strike in its third month. He said he didn't
expect large numbers to go back because of Eastern's new offer.
   He added that it takes up to two years to fully train a mechanic
to work on jetliners. Eastern officials said they couldn't estimate
how long it will take to train their new mechanics without knowing
their experience.
   The company plans to hire 500 non-union mechanics in the next
few months.
   ``We've said we have to rebuild the airline and the unions
flat-out have said they will not come back for current
management,'' Matell said. ``I don't think it should come as a
surprise.''
   Under its rebuilding plan, Eastern wants 2,500 mechanics. The
company had more than that when the Machinists union, which also
represents ramp agents, janitors and other ground workers, walked
out.
   Eastern must have bankruptcy court approval of its plan. The
court set a Wednesday deadline for offers from interested buyers.

   A 19-mile-long oil slick was
flowing down the Rhine River toward the Netherlands on Sunday, a
government official said.
   Johannes Winkel, a state spokesman in Duesseldorf, said West
German authorities issued an international pollution alert and
notified Dutch authorities that the spill was approaching their
territory.
   He said the spill apparently was caused by an unidentified ship
discharging its diesel fuel waste on Saturday night. Winkel did not
know how much oil had spilled, but he said the thin slick posed no
danger to the environment.
   It is illegal in West Germany to pump waste into a river, and
ships are supposed to dump it into dockside containers.

   Candidates for federal judge who belong to
discriminatory clubs are finding last-minute resignations may not
be enough to win over critics and save their chances for a seat on
the bench.
   ``Resigning immediately prior to being appointed or knowing that
one may be appointed is not adequate,'' says Sen. Howard M.
Metzenbaum, D-Ohio. ``It misses the point. The concern is that the
jurist is going to be considered open-minded and fair.''
   The Senate _ which makes the final decision on judicial
confirmation _ thus far has not flatly ruled out approval of
nominees who belong to discriminatory clubs, but the pendulum
appears headed that way.
   In practice, consideration of potentially controversial nominees
sometimes simply grinds to a halt without formal, public action.
   One attorney's hopes for a seat on the bench fizzled in 1988
when he waited until two weeks before his scheduled Senate hearing
to resign from Virginia's exclusive James River Club and told a
black group he never felt ``any kind of moral fire within my belly
to go out and correct what is perceived to be wrong by some.''
   A 17-year-veteran of the Colorado Supreme Court saw his hopes
die last year after he balked when lawmakers urged him to resign
from a country club with no black members and specific restrictions
on women. He said he would not bow to political pressure ``to
enhance my chances for confirmation.''
   The new concern about club memberships goes beyond the Senate.
   The American Bar Association last week took steps to revise its
rules and ban judges from being members of clubs that ``invidiously
discriminate.'' It could be the group's official policy by February
1990.
   No one is challenging the right of private clubs to
discriminate, as long as they are truly private and not merely
wearing that label as a means of dodging the public accommodations
laws.
   The question is how much membership in such a club should weigh
as lawmakers consider attorneys for lifetime appointments to the
bench and whether judges who belong to clubs that discriminate can
ever project an image of fairness.
   Metzenbaum says he could support a member of a discriminatory
club for judge if the candidate had consistently worked to change
such policies. But he scoffs at last-minute resignations merely to
appease the Judiciary Committee.
   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., another Judiciary Committee member,
says, however, that membership in such a club ``shouldn't be the
sole and only reason for knocking the guy down if he's extremely
well qualified.''
   ``It should not be used in the most extraordinary or absurd ways
that it's used sometimes in the Judiciary Committee,'' he says.
``If you like the guy's philosophy and you think he's great, you
don't care what the heck he belongs to.''
   Simpson says the club issue has not been applied evenly and
cites a pending dispute about the nomination of San Francisco
attorney Vaughn Walker for a District Court judgeship in that city.
   Walker, nominated by former President Reagan, stoutly defended
San Francisco's 128-year-old Olympic Club last year and failed to
win approval from the committee. The club had a handful of black
members and bylaw provisions that bar women.
   Walker's nomination was submitted again by President Bush and
Walker resigned from the club in February.
   Simpson notes that Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy was a
member of the same club and resigned a month before his 1987
hearing before the committee. He says the panel was tolerant of
Kennedy's belated resignation ``because he was exceptionally well
qualified.''
   As for Walker, Simpson says, ``They're still ramming it to him.''
   ``The whole transgression of his entire life is that he was a
member of this same sinister club,'' says Simpson. ``I think that's
stupid.''
   Meanwhile, Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., is protesting Walker's
defense of the club in testimony last year.
   ``I have reached the conclusion that his actions with respect to
his membership in a discriminatory club are disqualifying,''
Cranston said in an April 4 letter to Judiciary Committee Chairman
Joseph Biden, D-Del. Cranston said Walker should not be confirmed.
   Walker, nominated at the urging of Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif.,
declined to return repeated telephone calls to his office and home.
   Walker's critics, however, say they see a sharp difference
between the case of Kennedy and that of Walker. They note that
Kennedy resigned from another club in 1980 after advising it of his
concern about its discriminatory policies.
   And they cite his answer before the Judiciary Committee when
asked why it took him so long to leave the Olympic Club.
   He said that over the years he had ``tried to become more
sensitive to the existence of subtle barriers to the advancement of
women and of minorities in society. And this was an issue on which
I was continuing to educate myself.''

<HEAD>Cheney Wants Controversial Helicopter As Osprey Replacement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's cost-cutting
move to scrap the V-22 Osprey aircraft includes a plan to replace
it with the Super Stallion, a problem-plagued helicopter under
investigation for possible design flaws.
   A congressional firestorm over scrapping the Osprey can only be
fueled by Cheney's turn toward the Sikorsky Aircraft CH-53E Super
Stallion, the western world's largest helicopter, lawmakers say.
   The Osprey is designed to take off like a helicopter and fly
like an airplane. The Marine Corps wants it for surprise,
long-range amphibious assaults. The government has invested $2
billion in its development.
   Cheney, however, says that the Osprey must go as part of his
move to cut $10 billion in spending under the budget agreement
between Congress and the Bush administration.
   The Navy rebuffed congressional demands in 1987 for grounding
the Super Stallion and instead ordered Sikorsky to conduct a $9
million review to determine if a design flaw triggered seven
crashes between June 1984 and January 1987 that left 20 Marines
dead.
   That review, due last summer but delayed by additional Navy
requests, was delivered to the Pentagon in early February with the
company declaring the helicopter safe.
   Dissatisfied Pentagon officials sent it back to the company last
month for further tests, according to Bill Armstrong, spokesman for
the Naval Air Systems Command.
   ``We felt there were some areas of the TEP (test and evaluation
program) that had to be amplified,'' Armstrong said.
   Sikorsky says it will resubmit the review this summer. The
Pentagon does not expect a final determination on the study until
October, which means debate over Super Stallion and Osprey funding
for fiscal 1990 will rage on without the benefit of the
helicopter's safety report.
   Some Super Stallion critics are ready to fight Cheney's plan to
buy more of the helicopters in the absence of a Pentagon-approved
Sikorsky review.
   ``Until they can answer the question and do the review ... we
need to put this on hold,'' said Rep. Jim Bates, D-Calif., a former
Marine and a leading critic of the Super Stallion.
   But Cheney's request for more Super Stallions, which would
revive a program that was scheduled to end in the 1990 budget,
indicates Pentagon confidence in the helicopter, Sikorsky officials
maintain.
   ``They're anticipating that the good name of the helicopter will
be gotten back, as the results of the testing show,'' said Ken
Kelly, a Sikorsky vice president in charge of the Super Stallion
program. ``In a way, they have built in an anticipatory approval by
NavAir of the work that has been done.''
   Under the Reagan administration's budget, the Super Stallion
program was to have ended in the 1990 budget year with just three
more helicopters ordered.
   But to compensate for the planned elimination of the new
Ospreys, Cheney wants to buy 23 Super Stallions for 1990 and is
expected to ask for 23 annually in each subsequent year well into
the 1990s, according to congressional and industry sources. The
Super Stallions cost about $16 million each.
   Although the tilt-rotor Osprey could take off like a helicopter
and fly like a plane, military strategists believe the Super
Stallion can handle much of the Osprey's heavy-lift mission for the
Marines and Navy.
   The Super Stallion is a modified version of the Vietnam era
CH-53D Sea Stallion. The Super Stallion, with its larger rotors and
a third engine, can lift up to 18 tons, about double the old Sea
Stallion's capacity.
   But critics say the 16{-ton helicopter is simply too big and
should have been designed from scratch, not modified from the
smaller Sea Stallion.
   ``It was designed too large and there's no way you can make it
safe because of its size,'' said Bates.

   They thought they were getting free
sneakers, but 69 criminal suspects got snookered instead when they
showed up at a phony shoe store ``for people on the run'' and were
arrested on outstanding warrants.
   ``I knew this was too good to be true!'' one suspect exclaimed
as he was handcuffed by sheriff's deputies during the two-day sting
operation. ``I've never won anything.''
   The Lancaster County Sheriff's Office, masquerading as an
athletic footwear business, mailed 500 letters to people with
outstanding arrest warrants offering a free pair of athletic shoes
just for filling out a survey.
   The suspects were invited to show up at the new Grabar Athletic
Footwear store _ ``a new concept in shoe stores for people on the
run.''
   The name was a takeoff on Gray Bar Hotel, a slang term for jail.
   By 8 p.m. Saturday, little was left of Grabar. A small sign on
the door read ``Grabar Shoes closed. We'll catch you next time!!''
   Lancaster County Sheriff Ron Tussing said human nature helped
net 69 suspects on 96 active arrest warrants Friday and Saturday.
   ``I think when you appeal to people's greed, I think that's why
it was successful,'' Tussing said. ``Everybody wants to get
something for nothing.''
   The warrants were for offenses ranging from traffic infractions
to burglary, assault, drug possession and theft. The majority were
for minor offenses.
   After being taken to jail, suspects were required to post a bond
or pay whatever fines or costs they owed. One man arrested for back
child support had to pay $3,000.
   Of the 500 letters mailed, about 120 were returned because of
incorrect or outdated addresses, Tussing said. In similar
operations around the country, a 10 percent arrest rate has been
considered successful, he said.
   Three people who were arrested on outstanding warrants also were
arrested for marijuana possession at the ``store,'' and one person
was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon (brass knuckles).
   ``Some of these people have not committed real serious crimes,
but they haven't lived up to their responsibilities to pay fines or
whatever,'' Tussing said. ``It sends the message that we're not
going to ignore this stuff.''

<HEAD>Beijing University Students Set Conditions for Returning to Class</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Student leaders at Beijing University said Sunday
they will continue to boycott classes for at least five more days
and may hold more marches through the city to press their demands
for democratic reforms.
   Late Sunday, about 50 students marched around the university
campus chanting, ``Continue the strike! Continue the strike!'' The
cry soon was picked up by classmates shouting from dormitory
windows.
   Students at other universities in Beijing that participated in
the class boycott have decided to return to class after staging
several mass demonstrations that brought tens of thousands of
people onto the streets.
   But the independent student union at Beijing University, the
nation's most prestigious school, decided at a meeting Sunday night
to continue the boycott through Friday. ``We are the only ones
keeping the flame,'' said one student leader. The boycott began
April 24.
   The group listed as conditions for returning to class government
recognition of new student unions that have organized the fledgling
pro-democracy movement; reinstatement of a recently fired liberal
Shanghai newspaper editor; changing city laws that restrict
demonstrations; and an apology from the official People's Daily
newspaper for ``distorted reporting'' of the student movement.
   If the government fails to meet the conditions or refuses to
hold a dialogue with pro-democracy students, further protest
marches may be called, Beijing University student activists said.
   One new poster at the university suggested daily sit-ins at
Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of China.
   ``All of China watches Beijing. All of Beijing watches Beijing
University,'' another poster said.
   The largest protests in Communist China's 40-year history, in
which tens of thousands of students and workers marched through
Beijing and occupied Tiananmen Square, have resulted in
conciliatory statements from the nation's leaders and political
debate that would have been unimaginable just one month earlier.
   But leading student activists seem unsure of what to do next to
keep up the movement's momentum.
   Although Communist Party leader Zhao Ziyang on Thursday called
for talks with students, China's leadership has refused to talk
with the independent student unions.
   A new group of pro-democracy students was set up last week to
initiate talks with the government. It sent a written appeal to
party and government leaders, who promised to reply Monday.
   Xiang Xiaoji, a leader of the Student Dialogue Representative
Group, said Sunday the group wanted to ``raise some constructive
proposals for the future building of democracy and the legal
system.''
   Issues he named for discussion included education, family
planning and price reform, but he did not mention establishing a
free press and fighting corruption _ major demands of the democracy
movement.
   ``We don't set ourselves up as the government's opponent,''
Xiang said. ``Our government is the people's government, and we are
citizens.''

<HEAD>Federal Budget Writers Moving Quickly, But Still Face Rocky Path</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress' work on a $1.2 trillion federal
budget for next year is sliding ahead smoothly, but lawmakers now
face a series of prickly decisions on taxes, spending and _ of
course _ politics.
   The House and Senate each signed off on a pair of spending plans
Thursday. No surprise there: The documents reflected deals honed
last month between Bush administration officials and congressional
leaders, and the chambers' votes were little more than exercises in
rubber stamping.
   Negotiators from the two houses plan to meet this week to work
out a compromise budget. That job, too, is expected to be
sweat-free, because the two measures differ only slightly in how
they would distribute money among science, housing and other
domestic programs.
   There are three major landmarks lying ahead, however, where
jolting crunches could occur.
   First up is additional revenues, which are supposed to account
for about half of the $28 billion in deficit reduction in the
package.
   The budget says $5.3 billion is to come from increased tax
receipts. President Bush has claimed the budget allows him to honor
his campaign mantra of ``no new taxes,'' but strictly speaking that
has yet to be decided.
   Bush says $4.8 billion of the amount can be raised by lowering
the capital gains tax. His argument it that such a cut will spark
the economy and thus boost the government's overall tax take.
   Democrats largely oppose Bush's idea, calling it a boon for the
wealthy. Ominously, Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., of the House
Ways and Means Committee, which writes tax legislation, calls the
plan ``unpalatable.''
   The result: gridlock.
   ``Where are they going to deliver from?'' asks Peter J. Davis,
vice president of Prudential-Bache Securities, who monitors budget
activity.
   An additional $5.7 billion is supposed to come from sales of
government assets, and $2.7 billion more is slated to be raised by
increasing fees for certain federal services. Congress has rejected
some of these before, and could do so again.
   The second hurdle is the question of fiscal 1991. It doesn't
begin until Oct. 1, 1990, but lawmakers and Bush have promised to
try to complete a budget pact for that year over the next few
months. An early deal gives Bush a feather in his cap, and helps
legislators avoid imposing pain _ in the form of any resulting
taxes or spending cuts _ on their constituents during an election
year.
   This may not be easy. The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
requires a 1991 shortfall of no more than $64 billion _ formidable
considering this year's red ink should reach about $160 billion.
   Many lawmakers say slashes of that magnitude will require lots
of give on both sides: an acceptance of taxes by Bush and of
domestic program cuts by Democrats.
   Opinions vary on whether that will occur, or whether the result
will be a conglomeration of bookkeeping tricks, one-time windfalls
like asset sales, and heavy reliance on rosy economic projections
that make the deficit look smaller.
   ``Next year, senators on both sides of the aisle will be
demanding more deficit reduction than we had this year,'' predicts
Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``I don't know how we get around it next year, but mark my
words, we will,'' counters Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La., a
member of the budget panel.
   Hurdle No. 3 comes Aug. 15, when the White House's Office of
Management and Budget is required to update its projection of the
coming year's deficit with fresh economic figures. Under the
Gramm-Rudman law, should OMB determine that the shortfall will
exceed the 1990 target of $110 billion, a process begins that could
result in sweeping, politically unpalatable spending cuts.
   Most budget-watchers doubt OMB would upset things by deciding
that things are off course.
   `The general assumption is that when the administration and
Congress came up with their agreement, implicit was that OMB
wouldn't change the numbers very much'' in August, says Stanley
Collender, who watches budget action for the Price Waterhouse
accounting firm.

   Hours after last month's slaying of
an American colonel, President Corazon Aquino was asked her
reaction to the killing. She said U.S. security must have been
inadequate.
   A few days later, Mrs. Aquino told reporters she expected that
preliminary talks on a new treaty on U.S. military bases _ one of
the country's most divisive issues _ will begin this year.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus, clearly caught by surprise at
an apparent policy reversal, issued his own statement insisting the
government still has not decided whether to allow the bases to
remain after their lease expires in 1991.
   The two statements are examples of Mrs. Aquino's tendency to
make off-the-cuff public statements, which appear overly simplistic
and display a lack of skill in communicating policy.
   ``It's amazing how President Aquino is now often caught blurting
out things that other statesmen would hesitate to say under the
same circumstances,'' said Federico Pascual, editor in chief of the
independent Philippine Daily Inquirer.
   ``We don't know if these were remarks made for calculated effect
or were lapses whose implications were not immediately clear to the
president,'' he added.
   Often, Mrs. Aquino's answers to reporters' questions on
important national issues appear aimed at dodging responsibility
and display a strangely detached view of events.
   After Communist rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James ``Nick'' Rowe
on April 21, Mrs. Aquino said American officials here had been
stepping up security but that the measures obviously were
insufficient.
   Protection of American and other foreign officials is the
responsibility of the Philippine government.
   Only later, when she visited the U.S. Embassy for a memorial
service, did she express grief at the death of an officer assigned
to assist her own armed forces.
   During a recent conversation with reporters, Mrs. Aquino was
asked to comment on reports from a left-wing West German
publication that U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt was a CIA operative.
   Instead of dismissing the claim, Mrs. Aquino suggested the State
Department should comment publicly on the charge. That appeared to
give credence to the allegation, made by former CIA operative
Philip Agee, and served to keep the charge on the front pages of
Manila newspapers for two more days.
   Eventually, Mrs. Aquino said she was satisfied with Platt's
denial of the charge.
   Mrs. Aquino's media problems are based in part on an inefficient
system of access and a haphazard formula for obtaining the
president's views and comments.
   Press Secretary Teodoro Benigno resigned last month effective
May 16, and no successor has been named. Benigno was the fourth
presidential press secretary since Mrs. Aquino took office three
years ago. His tenure was marked by frequent battles with the press
over the issue of presidential access.
   For months, reporters' access was limited largely to ``ambush''
interviews, where journalists would gather at the entrance to her
office and bark a few questions as she arrived or left.
   That was replaced by a system in which reporters would submit
daily written questions. A few hours later, reporters received
terse written replies, ostensibly from the president.
   The presidential staff has recently revived the weekly ``mini
press conference,'' in which a few Filipino reporters meet with the
president. Reporters from foreign news organizations are excluded.

   James C. Moore, one of 10 people who graduated
from a special nursing assistants course for the homeless, said his
new job will be ``just the beginning'' of his plans to be a doctor
some day.
   ``It gave me a second chance in life,'' Moore said Saturday as
he graduated from the training course offered by the Samaritan
House shelter and the Denver public schools' adult education
center. It is believed to be the first in the nation to train the
homeless to be nurses assistants.
   ``At 39 years old, it's not easy to just jump up and say, `I
need a second chance.'''
   Moore moved to Samaritan House with his 14-year-old son this
spring. He said he dropped out of college after a few years, lost
direction, floated through a series of temporary jobs, then
couldn't support both himself and his son after his estranged wife
no longer could keep the boy.
   At a graduation ceremony Saturday at the governor's mansion,
schools Superintendent Dick Koeppe called the ``Operation
Opportunity'' course a ``win-win'' endeavor that trains the
homeless to get jobs and also eases the national nursing shortage.
   Rep. Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., spoke at the ceremony, saying that
the program illustrates that ``we have got to get together on this
issue of homelessness ... and help each other keep moving forward.''
   ``I salute your grit, your backbone, your intellect ... and your
perseverance,'' Schroeder told the eight graduates who attended the
ceremony, dressed in white nursing uniforms.
   Twelve shelter residents were selected a month ago to
participate in the three-week, crash program for nursing assistants
at the adult education center.
   Moore said they took classes all day, were tutored at night, and
burned the midnight oil studying together.
   Ten graduated, all with a B average or better, and have been
guaranteed jobs at two nursing homes. The graduates will make more
than $5 an hour plus benefits, said Lynn Kelly, spokeswoman for the
education center.
   ``That's a far cry from the dead-end, minimum-wage job,'' Kelly
said.
   Kathy Rembert, who directs the jobs program at Samaritan House
and selected the 12 original students, said the graduates will help
shatter stereotypes of the homeless.
   ``I was looking for five success stories,'' she said. ``We had
10.''

   Starting with a fortuitous opportunity to
invest in a gas well in 1979, House Speaker Jim Wright staked much
of his financial future on oil and gas investments.
   He usually made money, received a sweetheart deal or two and
occasionally was bailed out of financial jams by friends and
associates. But the transactions never made Wright rich.
   And at least one major non-energy investment turned into a
substantial loss for the future House speaker, whose financial
climb began only after years spent in debt.
   Now battling House ethics committee charges that he may have
committed 69 rules violations in his private business transactions,
Wright was a self-described pauper in 1971.
   ``My finances are a shambles,'' he wrote in his diary Dec. 30
that year. ``With what unbelievable folly have I so long ignored
them and let them drift ... I'm driving a 10-year-old car, owe so
god-awful much money I'll need luck to pay it off. But I will,
somehow I will.''
   Wright's luck changed one day early in 1979, when he showed up
early for a scheduled lunch with a family of Fort Worth oil
investors, the Moncriefs.
   By chance, family members told the ethics committee, the oilmen
began discussing whether to invest in an east Texas gas well.
Family patriarch and oil lobbyist Monty Moncrief, and his son Tex,
had little interest in the relatively small investment. But Tex's
son Richard suggested that his grandfather make the deal for some
of the other grandchildren.
   Richard and Monty Moncrief turned to Wright and asked if he
wanted ``to take a little interest in this deal.'' The then-House
majority leader accepted, later investing $19,788.
   Before that day Wright had assets of between $72,000 and
$170,000 _ mostly the value of his Fort Worth home _ according to
his 1978 financial disclosure form. The report requires listings of
income and assets only in broad ranges.
   From then forward, his finances improved. But it was a roller
coaster ride _ up one year, down the next _ according to a record
pieced together from his own congressionally required disclosure
statements, the report of the ethics committee's special counsel,
Richard J. Phelan, and published material.
   Wright profited from interests in oil and gas wells, a handsome
return on two oil stocks sold by his half-owned investment company,
Mallightco, and Mallightco gemstone and real estate investments.
   But he lost most of $100,000 he had borrowed to invest in a
nursing home company that later filed for bankruptcy protection,
even though he got back at least $22,000 in dividends that other
shareholders were unsuccessful in obtaining, according to published
reports.
   Wright's most profitable deal was in 1988, just before he sold
his half of Mallightco to his partner, George Mallick. By that time
Wright's share was part of a blind trust he created in 1987. He
directed the trustee to sell his share to recoup enough money to
pay off the nursing home loan.
   Mallick, meanwhile, was looking for a last, ``bet the farm''
investment. It turned up with the purchase and same-day resale of
an interest in an prospective oil and gas well. Mallightco bought
the well for $9,120 in cash and sold it for a $340,000 profit. The
well turned up dry.
   The ethics committee is still investigating that pair of
transactions, even as it plans for hearings on the 69 unrelated
allegations that Wright circumvented House income limits and
accepted improper gifts from Mallick.
   According to his disclosure statements, Wright's income was
between $85,703 and $101,700 in 1979. It climbed to between
$192,560 and $326,550 in 1983, the year he sold his Fort Worth
home, and peaked at $358,764 to $736,758 in 1986, when he earned
significant oil and gas revenue and profited from a cable
television stock sale. In 1987, it fell to between $169,185 and
$177,682.
   Wright listed the value of his holdings in 1983, the peak year,
at between $415,015 and $1,075,000. Half the total was attributed
to investments in oil and gas wells and the value of his Fort Worth
home.
   By 1987, when the holdings went into the blind trust, his listed
assets dropped to a range of between $155,000 and $435,000. Part of
the difference can be attributed to the way speaker filled out his
disclosure forms.
   Wright sold his Fort Worth home, valued at between $100,001 and
$250,000 in August 1983, and purchased a more expensive home in
McLean, Va., which last year was appraised at more than $352,000,
according to the Wall Street Journal.
   The Texas Democrat's Fort Worth home was listed as an asset in
accordance with the rules because it produced rental income. The
McLean home apparently had no rental income and was not listed as
part of Wright's holdings.
   Another possible contributor for the drop in assets was Wright's
disastrous 1983 investment in Jewell Enterprises of Arlington,
Texas, a nursing home venture.
   Whether or not Wright received favored treatment through
dividend payments, as other Jewell stockholders told The New York
Times last week, his investment became worthless when the company
filed for bankruptcy protection in 1985 and later began liquidation.

   Wright often had to borrow money to make his investments. Often,
he also relied on friends and business associates to bail him out.
His first gas well investment in 1979 with the Moncriefs is an
example.
   In 1983, both demand and prices for natural gas had declined,
and no gas was being extracted from the Moncrief well.
   By December of that year, Wright owed a bank $20,600 in
principal and interest on the loan that financed his investment in
the venture. A month later the now-deceased oilman, Monty Moncrief,
bought back Wright's interest in well for $20,000 and the speaker
used the money to pay off his loan.
   Over the 4{-year investment, Wright paid more than $30,000 in
drilling and monthly operating costs, but earned $39,353 _ $20,000
coming from the Moncrief bailout.
   Wright also had purchased from Moncrief interest in a second
east Texas well known to contain substantial quantities of natural
gas. Donald Hockaday, an independent oil and gas consultant, told
the ethics committee that deal posed no risk for Wright.
   ``I would be prone to think it was a sweetheart agreement,''
Hockaday testified. ``You know, I would love to have a chance to do
that every day.''
   Wright paid $50,000 for his interest, $35,000 of it from a bank
loan. But Hockaday calculated the value of Wright's interest at
$132,000 to $140,000, because it was clear the well would produce
gas.
   Wright held onto the well at least through late 1988, paying a
total of $56,475 in drilling and monthly operation costs and
receiving income of $74,480 from the venture, according to the
ethics committee's counsel.
   It was in 1980 that Wright and his partner, Mallick, formed
Mallightco. The company enjoyed early success through transactions
in oil stocks.
   An investment in Delhi Oil netted $83,000 in profits in five
months. Buying and selling Supron Energy Corp. stock resulted in a
$27,500 profit over 14 months, according to the ethics panel's
counsel.
   In addition, a $40,000 investment in gemstones brought in
distributions of $62,950, A profit of $41,182 was made on a Florida
real estate deal.
   But Mallightco lost money on other stock deals _ $6,314 in one
case, $1,115 in another and $700 in a third instance.
   Wright, his wife, Mallick and his wife, often had to borrow to
make Mallightco investments, sometimes borrowing from Mallightco
itself. By the end of 1981, Wright and his wife, Betty, owed their
company nearly $120,000.
   By 1984, the Wrights were no longer meeting the interest
payments on their debt owed Mallightco.
   ``The company never demanded payment from the Wrights or took
any steps to collect the debt,'' Phelan's report said.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister Asks NATO To Play Down Missile Flap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher on Sunday said Western allies must not let a feud over
Europe's short-range nuclear missiles become the central issue of
the NATO alliance.
   Genscher also reiterated West Germany's demand that the
superpowers begin talks soon on reducing the short-range missiles.
Washington and Britain oppose the talks.
   West Germany also wants NATO to delay until 1992 a decision on
whether to modernize short-range Lance missiles based in West
Germany.
   But, in an apparent effort to tone down the dispute that has
split the alliance, he said said the disagreement should not become
a dominant issue.
   Genscher, in a speech in Stuttgart to mark the beginning of
``German-American Friendship Week,'' said: ``It would be out of all
proportion if the question of whether to decide upon a new weapons
system ... is made into the central issue of the alliance.''
   A copy of Genscher's speech was released in Bonn.
   The United States oppposes any negotiations on grounds that NATO
needs the missiles to compensate for the overwhelming superiority
of Warsaw Pact conventional forces. It also says the Lance rockets
soon will be obsolete and must be modernized to travel greater
distances.
   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear missiles are based in West
Germany. Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government is losing support in
public opinion polls and Kohl fears a decision to deploy new
missiles could cost him the next federal election in December 1990.
   Referring to a wave of reforms in the Soviet bloc, Genscher said
the Western alliance should use the ``historical opportunity'' to
forge new East-West relations.
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters, speaking at the same ceremony
in Stuttgart, warned NATO against ``overestimating the significance
of political changes'' in Eastern Europe.

<TEXT>
   A card game in Deadwood got Wild Bill
Hickok killed, but things have quieted down since the legendary
lawman was gunned down during a hand of poker in the frontier
town's shoot-'em up days.
   True, blackjack and poker are on their way back, but the new
dealers of Deadwood are taking a college-sponsored course to learn
how to lay out the cards, and the newly legalized gambling will be
deliberately a low-stakes affair.
   ``I grew up in Deadwood. This is like going back in time and
reliving a part of Deadwood's past,'' says Lori Keehn Struble, 23,
whose family owns the saloon where Hickok died in 1876 holding his
legendary ``dead man's hand'' of aces and eights.
   Struble is enrolled in a course that is training blackjack
dealers for the historic Black Hills town's new gambling halls. She
plans to work as a dealer in the family's No. 10 Saloon.
   ``There's a lot to learn,'' Struble says. ``There's so much
concentration involved.''
   Voters statewide authorized limited gambling in Deadwood last
November. Only blackjack, poker and slot machines are allowed, and
bets may not exceed $5. Members of the South Dakota Gaming
Commission, appointed last month, said gambling could start late
this summer.
   The blackjack dealers' course, which began last week, is offered
through Western South Dakota Vocational Technical Institute.
Twenty-eight students are enrolled in the first session.
   Gary Whiteaker, coordinator of adult business and industry
training, said educators consulted with community colleges in
Nevada to design the course.
   ``You don't go out and find a blackjack dealing curriculum on
the shelf,'' he said.
   William Thornhill, a former dealers-school owner with 10 years'
experience dealing in Las Vegas, teaches the course. He says
Deadwood's focus on low-key gambling and games of skill should lead
to success for the town of 2,000 and its players.
   Gaming Commission Chairman Chuck Lien of Rapid City said the
panel must hire a staff, write rules to control gambling and devise
a security system to prevent corruption. Lien said the commission
has requested copies of gaming rules from Nevada, New Jersey and
other states where limited gambling is allowed.
   The city's share of gambling revenue will go toward historic
preservation, and locals say they want to keep the old-time western
atmosphere in and the glitz out of this gambling center.
   ``The fact that we've limited the bets to five dollars is going
to be less intimidating to people,'' said Bill Walsh, a gambling
supporter and owner of the Franklin Hotel. ``You can't have a sign
that says `casino.' Traditionally, we called them poker rooms and
gambling halls. There'll be no blinking neon lights in Deadwood.
   ``There are very few towns in the United States that have that
Western mystique,'' he said.
   As Lien put it, ``We'll never be a Las Vegas or an Atlantic
City.''
   Walsh said operators of large casinos are watching Deadwood with
interest to see how the gambling venture fares.
   ``If we just imitate our past, we'll be successful,'' he said.
``If we become more than that, sort of a Western Disneyland of
gambling, there'll be a lot of outside investors looking at us.
There's that big question mark out there right now. We just don't
know.''

<HEAD>PEN Writers' Group Expected To Approve Soviet Chapter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MAASTRICHT, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   PEN is expected to admit a new
Soviet chapter this week in a move that would open the
international writers' group to artists from the Soviet Union for
the first time in 65 years.
   Alexandre Blokh, PEN's international secretary, said in an
interview on Sunday that he expects the organization's 53rd
International Conference to admit the Soviet chapter in a vote
Wednesday.
   ``They're certainly welcome and I think there will be no
difficulty,'' Blokh said of the Soviet chapter, which was formed
last year.
   The PEN conference, a gathering of 300 novelists, poets,
playwrights and other literary figures, opens in Maastricht on
Monday.
   Those attending will represent the 10,000 members of PEN, or
Poets, Playwrights, Editors, Essayists and Novelists, a
London-based group with about 60 chapters in its member nations.
   In 1924, PEN turned down the Soviet Union's request to join the
group, and since then the writers' group has consistently opposed
Soviet membership because of the nation's persecution of writers
and intellectuals.
   The first official act of the new Soviet PEN chapter was to
condemn the death threat Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran issued
against British author Salman Rushdie, according to the Soviet
newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta.
   If the Soviet chapter is approved, its members will have to sign
the PEN charter, which condemns censorship and says ``free
criticism of governments, administrations and institutions (is)
imperative.''
   The newspaper said members of the Soviet chapter include poets
Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky, novelists Anatoly
Rybakov and Chengiz Aitmatov, historian Dmitri Likhachev, and
playwright Mikhail Shatrov.
   The approval of the Soviet chapter would be a significant
breakthrough for Soviet writers, who were isolated from many
international cultural groups until their nation's intellectual
climate began to improve recently.
   It would also be the latest indication that Western
organizations approve of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of
``glasnost,'' or greater openness in Soviet cultural and
intellectual affairs.
   One obstacle to Soviet membership has been the large number of
languages used in the country, Blokh said. Because PEN chapters are
usually open to only one language group, the Soviets would be
entitled to dozens of chapters and therefore be able to exert a
disproportionate amount of influence, he said.
   Under a compromise hammered out by the PEN leadership in Moscow
last month, the Soviets would be allowed to open a maximum of five
chapters, said Blokh.
   Andrei Bitov, a novelist heading the six-man delegation of
Soviet observers at the conference, told The Associated Press that
Soviet PEN membership would be only ``one of the smaller changes''
made possible by Gorbachev.
   ``This organization was understood to be by those in power as
reactionary (and) anti-Soviet,'' he said.
   Even now, ``A lot of Soviet writers regard this only as an
organization of prestige, not as an organization which will
struggle against censorship (and for) the human rights of a
writer,'' said Bitov, who himslef faced a six-year publication ban
from 1979-85.

<HEAD>Soviets May Seek Extradition of Hockey Star</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet military authorities may seek the
extradition of a Soviet hockey star on charges he deserted the Red
Army when he defected to the United States, a Moscow newspaper said
Sunday.
   Lt. Alexander Mogilny disappeared Thursday in Stockholm, Sweden,
after helping the Soviet National Team win the World Hockey
Championships.
   The 20-year-old forward, considered one of the country's best
prospects, arrived in the United States a day later on an airline
ticket paid for by the Buffalo Sabres, the National Hockey League
club that had chosen him in last year's player draft.
   His story was recounted Sunday in the newspaper Sovietsky Sport
under the headline, ``The Golden Calf and the Horsethieves from
Buffalo.''
   Like many Soviet athletes, Mogilny is a junior officer in the
Red Army, and the newspaper quoted a Moscow prosecutor as saying
the hockey star is now under investigation for desertion.
   ``If the crime is confirmed, I think we will ask for extradition
of the officer,'' said Col. Leonid Obyektov, prosecutor for the
Moscow garrison.
   ``Evasion of military service and desertion is considered to be
a grave crime in all countries,'' Obyektov said. ``To study all the
details of this affair, we will request through the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs legal assistance of the appropriate U.S.
organizations.''
   ``The investigation will include the interrogation of Mogilny
and any other searches for facts which might be required,'' the
prosecutor said.
   The United States does not have an extradition agreement with
the Soviet Union, according to an embassy spokesman in Moscow.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, he noted, ``There have been a
lot of defectors, and I'm sure many could have been charged with a
violation of some Soviet law.''
   The Sovietsky Sport article was one of many in Soviet newspapers
that strongly criticized Mogilny, a member of the Central Red Army
team, for succumbing to the lure of capitalist cash.
   The Defense Ministry newspaper Red Star complained that the
``runaway'' had been spoiled in the Soviet Union with everything he
wanted. Having consumed everything the Soviet economy could
provide, ``thoughts of the forward stretched beyond the ocean where
carrots are sweeter and pay is larger,'' the newspaper said.
   But another star Soviet hockey player, Anatoly Firsov, said such
a defection should have been expected because of a long-simmering
dispute between national team members who want to play for the West
and a resisting coach, Viktor Tikhonov.
   ``The situation on the team is explosive, and something like
that had to happen,'' said Firsov, a newly elected member of the
Soviet Parliament.
   Soviet sports authorities were due to discuss the signing of
several hockey players with the NHL after the team's return from
Stockholm.
   Moscow in general has become increasingly receptive to overtures
from U.S. professional sports leagues interested in acquiring
Soviet players.

<TEXT>
   A Greek-Cypriot soldier apparently
committed suicide Sunday after he fired across the Green Line that
divides the capital and wounded a Turkish-Cypriot soldier, said a
U.N. spokesman.
   ``The preliminary indications are that the National Guard
soldier fired several shots,'' said Charles Gaulkin, spokesman for
the U.N. peacekeeping force that patrols the buffer zone on the
war-divided island. ``He apparently hit the Turkish soldier in the
right leg and then shot himself.''
   Gaulkin said the investigation was continuing into the incident
at the 40-yard buffer zone in the Kaymakli district of the capital.
   ``We have no indication of why he shot himself,'' Gaulkin said.
   The Cyprus government denied the Greek Cypriot fired across the
buffer zone. The Defense Ministry issued an official statement
saying that Nikolaos Michaelides, 19, from Nicosia, was standing
guard on the Green Line at 5:30 a.m. when he died. The statement
said he died from a self-inflicted wound but that it was unclear
whether it was an accident or a suicide.
   Turkey's news agency, Anatolia, said Erbil Kavran, 20, from
Kyrenia, was in serious condition after being shot in the leg. It
said he was fired at three times from 40 yards across the buffer
zone.
   Sheena Wood, an artist who lives near the Green Line in the
district, said she heard ``a lot of bangs'' at the time. ``There
were three shots and then a little gap and then four or five shots.
Then it went quiet.''
   Gaulkin said U.N. troops from the Canadian contingent arrived
soon after the shooting but that each side had evacuated its
casualty.
   Cyprus has been partitioned since Turkish troops invaded in 1974.
   Conscripts from the 13,000-strong Greek Cypriot National Guard
are posted along the confrontation line slicing through the old
walled city in the center of the Cypriot capital.
   Thousands of Turkish and Turkish-Cypriot soldiers are stationed
along the northern side of the line.
   The two communities have agreed to a limited disengagement
following a sharp increase last year in shooting incidents along
the buffer zone. Five people were killed by gunfire between May and
December last year, the same number of fatalities reported between
1976 and May 1988.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Presidential campaigns wind up
this week much as they began: Carlos Menem of the Peronist Party
leads in the polls and Eduardo Angeloz is plagued by his governing
party's economic failures.
   Three fringe candidates have staked out issues further to the
right and left but were expected to receive only 11 percent of the
ballots on May 14. Argentines were also to vote for one-half the
Chamber of Deputies, as well as state legislators in 16 of the 22
provinces.
   ``Angeloz could win, but his deficit is very big. If you ask me,
it isn't very likely,'' said pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo. His
survey two weeks ago gave the Radical Civic Union candidate 29
percent of the vote, with 34 percent going to Menem and 21 percent
to undecideds.
   Polls published April 30 in the capital's two largest
circulation dailies, Clarin and La Nacion, gave Menem a 10-point
edge, 36 percent to 26 percent for Angeloz. But one in four voters
was undecided.
   The main issue is the economy, which has declined for the past
four decades but plunged this year. Argentina's currency, the
austral, has been devalued by about 80 percent since February,
igniting 35 percent monthly inflation.
   Wages have not kept pace, business is in disarray, and basic
goods like medicine, milk and spare parts for industry are in short
supply or sold at several times the price of two months ago.
   Today's images of Argentina are empty shelves at pharmacies,
long lines at foreign exchange houses, a Central Bank out of paper
to print money, doctors and teachers and mail carriers on strike, a
poor housewife buying eggs and apples for her family, one at a time.
   ``I was better off five years ago than I am now,'' said Gustavo
Battiato, a 31-year-old repairman for the state telephone company.
``I voted for (President Raul) Alfonsin. I won't vote for Angeloz.''
   Angeloz, a 57-year-old provincial governor, hasn't thrown in the
towel. At rallies last week he attracted large crowds. Aides
predict 200,000 will attend his closing rally in Buenos Aires on
Tuesday.
   Angeloz's prescription for the country's economic ills is
conservative: sell inefficient state companies, balance the
national budget, encourage foreign investment, curb the power of
organized labor, increase exports, pay the foreign debt.
   Menem, a 58-year-old governor, recognizes the same problems _
triple-digit inflation, high unemployment, stagnant gross national
product, a foreign debt of $59 billion that is third highest in the
developing world _ but proposes other solutions.
   To curb the budget deficit he would raise taxes. To reduce the
burden of state companies, he would increase their efficiency
rather than sell them. To resolve the foreign debt, he would
negotiate with creditors a moratorium on payments for several years.
   The two represent different constituencies _ Angeloz, the middle
class, and Menem, organized labor, state employees and the poor.
   Apartment owners have taken their properties off the market,
fearing if elected, Menem might implement a rent freeze. Investors
have sent hundreds of millions of dollars out of the country,
fearing exchange controls under a Peronist government.
   Watching developments from the sidelines are the armed forces,
which overthrew Juan Domingo Peron in 1955, Arturo Frondizi in
1962, Arturo Illia in 1966 and Isabel Peron in 1976.
   Disgruntled officers staged three insurrections against
President Alfonsin between April 1987 and December 1988, with the
trials of officers a key grievance.
   Angeloz has tried to distance himself from an unpopular
government and capitalize on what he calls the public ``fear of
Menem.''
   At every opportunity, he brings up the street violence,
corruption and administrative incompetence of the Peronist
government headed by Isabel Peron, the general's third wife.
   Results may not be known until Aug. 10, when the Electoral
College discloses the tally of its 600 members.
   The inauguration won't be until Dec. 10, the final day of
Alfonsin's six-year term.

<HEAD>Settlement in Racial Bias Suit at McChord AFB</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TACOMA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has tentatively approved a
settlement of a decade-old class-action racial discrimination
lawsuit filed by black civilian employees of McChord Air Force Base.
   U.S. District Court Judge Robert Bryan said Friday that he found
the settlement fair and reasonable, but the agreement won't be
final before mid-August.
   About 125 current and former black employees who were denied
promotions they sought or who were discouraged from applying are
eligible to receive a total of $415,000 in back wages the
government agreed to pay under the agreement. The suit included
about 300 current and former black employees.
   Williams said payments should range between about $500 and
$15,000.
   The settlement is designed to correct what black employees said
was a system that fostered discrimination in promotions at the
base. The federal government did not admit wrongdoing in the
agreement.
   ``I'm very confident that the people in the civilian personnel
office will make a legitimate effort to ensure that what occurred
in the past does not occur in the future,'' said Sidney A.
Williams, who has worked at McChord for 33 years and filed the
original claim in 1979.
   ``If nobody ever complains, nothing ever changes,'' Williams
said.
   The preliminary settlement provides for the promotions of 12
blacks to currently vacant supervisory positions or higher-paying
positions that eventually could lead to supervisory posts.

   Racing high-powered cars at perilous
speeds is a form of relaxation for Paul Newman, according to the
track owner who has been watching the actor unwind from his present
movie chores.
   Newman is in town to film ``Blaze,'' the story of former Gov.
Earl K. Long's controversial 1950s relationship with New Orleans
stripper Blaze Starr.
   About 2,000 people crowded Baton Rouge Raceway here Friday night
to see Newman, who came from the movie set still costumed in a
black tuxedo and red socks.
   Newman was scheduled to present awards to race winners, but
showed up before the featured races were run. So he made a brief
speech, exhorting the crowd to ``raise hell,'' and left.
   Track owner Donald Watson said he had opened up his track for
Newman three times last week so the actor, who's also a leading
race driver, could ``wind down'' by racing on its dirt track.
   ``He enjoys racing. It's a way for him to wind down. Racing
totally takes your mind off other things,'' said Watson.
   ``It's not a hobby. Paul takes it seriously,'' Watson said.

   Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor is one of
five investors who bought a $1.1 million 50-unit apartment building
here.
   Taylor, an All-Pro linebacker who lives in Upper Saddle River,
will be key owner of the building, his lawyer, James R. Acheson,
said Saturday.
   Pamela Goldstein, spokeswoman for Newark Mayor Sharpe James,
confirmed Saturday that Taylor had closed on some property. Ms.
Goldstein said she was told the building would be ``affordable
housing.''
   Although Taylor has never lived in Newark, he wants to bring
better housing to the state's largest city, Acheson said.
   He said the mayor ``invited (Taylor) down to visit the mayor's
office and the two of them got along very well. Sharpe James wants
people to invest in Newark ... and Lawrence Taylor took him up on
it.''
   ``We felt this is a good example for other people who have made
it big in sports ... and other professional people,'' Ms. Goldstein
said.

   Clara Hale, an 84-year-old New York
City woman who nurtures children born to drug addicts and AIDS
patients, was awarded the 16th annual Truman Award for Public
Service.
   ``Doing this is what makes me happy,'' she said. ``God put us
here with brains to think and do, and we're here to help one
another. When you do that, you radiate.
   ``I feel really good. I'm working for that day when God calls me
home and says, `Well done.'''
   Independence Mayor Barbara Potts presented the award on the
steps of the Truman Library in Independence Saturday. She noted
that Mrs. Hale ``did not wait for a government program'' to give
babies a second chance through nurturing and love.
   Lorraine E. Hale, Mrs. Hale's daughter and executive director of
the Hale House in New York City, summed up her mother's philosophy:
``These children are all born good. They're born honest. And they
need a lot of love.''
   Mrs. Hale said she teaches all of her little ones to say two
things: ``please'' and ``thank you.''
   And she told the crowd, ``Please invite me again and thank you
so much.'' Hale House was born in 1969 when Mrs. Hale discovered a
child in the arms of an addict on a New York street corner. Since
then, she and her daughter have helped raise more than 600 infants
in the non-profit residential program, operating in a Harlem
brownstone.
   Mrs. Hale's efforts became widely known after then-President
Reagan singled her out for praise as an example of voluntarism.

   The high school math teacher whose career
was chronicled in the movie ``Stand and Deliver'' told graduating
University of South Carolina students to remain committed to
education and set high goals.
   ``I believe in what I'm doing and I believe in education _ it is
the ticket to success,'' Jaime Escalante told undergraduates at the
ceremony Saturday.
   But Escalante, 58, warned that the country's educational system
is not keeping pace with other countries'.
   ``Our system of education needs a new schematic. We have to
rebuild,'' he said. ``We're falling behind because we are not
teaching responsibility. We must become a nation of people who
think for a living.''
   Escalante received an honorary doctor of science degree from the
university. His efforts to teach high-level mathematics to
inner-city Los Angeles youths inspired the movie, in which he was
portrayed by ``Miami Vice'' star Edward James Olmos.

   Hunger activist Bob Geldof, after blasting the
media for getting in the way of world understanding, urged the
creation of a global broadcast university.
   ``It is essential that people be given access to information on
matters that influence them,'' Geldof told a gathering Saturday of
international contributors to the ``CNN World Report,'' a
production of Cable News Network.
   Geldof, an Irish rock musician and composer, organized the Live
Aid benefit concert that raised $72 million for African famine
victims in 1985. That concert sparked similar efforts, including
one announced Friday by Turner Broadcasting System and Jesse
Jackson to aid victims of the Dec. 7 earthquake in Armenia.
   Geldof said Jackson has asked for his help in that eight-hour
concert, scheduled for Aug. 12.
   Calling television ``a hindrance to understanding'' and ``the
single worst anti-democratic force in the world today,'' Geldof
told the broadcasters the mass media concentrates on images, quick
interviews and controversy at the expense of improving
understanding.
   ``Controversy is not necessarily information,'' he said.
``Giving facts is not enough.''
   He called on broadcasters to communicate directly to the people
in rural areas of the Third World. Geldof suggested distributing
solar-powered radios to people in areas lacking electricity so they
could tune in to the global university, which should offer
``recognized degrees.''

<HEAD>Bentsen Says Forces Behind Medicare Equalization Bill `Well-Marshaled</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Six years after deciding rural hospitals could
live on less than their urban counterparts, Congress appears ready
to revise the Medicare payment schedule to give a financial boost
to isolated hospitals.
   But finding money to bring rural hospitals to the same
reimbursement level as their city counterparts will be tough in
these days of tight budgets, says Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas,
sponsor of the Equity for Rural Hospitals Act.
   Moreover, Bentsen cautions that no single bill will solve all of
the problems of rural hospitals and federal health officials say
Medicare cannot be the sole source of a hospital's survival.
   ``For some hospitals, no matter what you do to the Medicare
system, you would not save the hospital or have a significant
impact,'' said Louis B. Hays, acting administrator of the federal
Health Care Financing Administration.
   Medicare is ``just one piece of the picture and there is nothing
Medicare can do to produce more patients for a hospital that has a
10 percent occupancy rate,'' Hays said.
   Although Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan is
concerned about ensuring access to health care in rural and inner
city areas, the department has not yet taken a position on
Bentsen's bill, said spokesman Campbell Gardett.
   Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee, said bringing rural
hospitals to the same reimbursement levels as their urban
counterparts would cost $700 million annually when fully phased in.
   His bill, cosponsored by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole and
backed by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, calls for phasing
in a uniform Medicare reimbursement rate beginning in 1991.
   But Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa and a member of the Senate Rural
Health Caucus, warned the Finance Committee last week that Congress
could face a ``drastic price tag'' for rebuilding the rural health
care system if quick action is not taken.
   ``I'll do what I can to accelerate it,'' Bentsen said Friday in
an interview. ``You have to find the money to accelerate it, that's
the problem in these budget constraints. I expect to get some money
for it, but not as much as those rural hospitals would want in that
first year.''
   ``I'm optimistic about the chances for passing my rural hospital
bill this year and I'm making it a high priority,'' Bentsen said.
``I have some 56 senators cosponsoring it. ... I've got my forces
well marshaled.''
   Numerous other bills have been introduced in Congress to deal
with the rural health care crisis, including legislation that seeks
to impose a one-year moratorium on Medicare cuts in reimbursements
to rural hospitals.
   When Congress established the Medicare prospective payment
system (PPS) in 1983, lawmakers assumed rural hospital cost would
be lower than city hospitals. Under PPS, rural hospitals are
reimbursed at least 12 percent less than urban hospitals by
Medicare _ the government's health insurance program for the
elderly and disabled.
   But lawmakers say that differential can no longer be justified:
rural hospitals frequently pay higher labor costs because of the
difficulty of attracting professionals to an isolated area, they
aren't big enough to buy supplies in bulk, they are more dependent
on Medicare patients than city hospitals, and the costs of indigent
health have become a growing financial burden.
   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., said the problems of rural
hospitals also stem in part from the changing demographics and
economic environment of rural communities.
   ``The country as a whole is developing a two-track economy,''
Durenberger told the Finance Committee. ``The more prosperous one
is centered in major cities on both coasts, and in stark contrast,
the `heartland' communities are in recession.''

   New Coke is 4 years old and an also-ran in the
cola wars, but Coca-Cola Co. says there's plenty of fizz left in
the beverage that helped revolutionize the marketing of soft drinks.
   Coca-Cola was the world's most popular soft drink and more. The
brand had become a symbol of the pervasive influence of American
power and culture around the globe.
   So it was no small decision when the company decided to
reformulate the cola it had sold for 99 years. And it triggered no
small reaction. The consumer backlash to the new drink was so
strong that the company quickly brought back the original formula
under the name Coca-Cola Classic.
   Four years later, what goes by the label of Coke is virtually
ignored by consumers while Classic Coke reigns No. 1. But company
officials say they have no plans to drop the new formula, and
industry analysts say they're right.
   ``It's regarded as the absolute biggest marketing travesty ever
hoisted on the American public. With God's help, everyone will have
similar mistakes,'' said Jesse Meyers, who publishes Beverage
Digest in Greenwich, Conn.
   ``The announcement of new Coke gave new birth to all Coca-Cola
products and the entire soft drink industry,'' he said.
   The introduction of the new Coke heated up the ``cola wars,''
and saw companies step up their efforts to introduce new variations
of their name-brand products to gain a greater share of the $45
billion soft-drink market. Now there is not only Coke and Classic
Coke, but diet Coke, caffeine-free Coke and even regular and diet
Cherry Coke.
   Arch-rival Pepsico may regard the new Coke as a ``pretty nominal
player,'' but it believes a company's full product line is more
important than any single drink, said spokesman Todd MacKenzie.
   ``The parts make up the whole,'' MacKenzie said.
   Indeed, Coca-Cola emphasizes that its entire line of soft drinks
is strong and claims to hold a dominant 33.7 percent share of the
retail market.
   The brand name with the new formula that for years was the
best-seller had dropped to 10th place at the end of 1988, tied with
RC Cola and caffeine-free Diet Pepsi. The new Coke had a mere 1.4
percent of the market, down from 1.6 percent in 1987, according to
Beverage Digest.
   By contrast, Classic Coke _ the old Coke with the new name _
held the No. 1 position with 20.1 percent of the market. Pepsi Cola
was No. 2 with 18.7 percent.
   Even with its slim market share, the new Coke makes money and
generates $675 million a year in revenue, said Randy Donaldson, a
spokesman at the company's Atlanta headquarters.
   ``If Coca-Cola had any other name on it, it would be perceived
as a huge success,'' Donaldson said. ``Because the can has
`Coca-Cola' on it, the expectations were huge.''
   Emanuel Goldman, a soft drink industry analyst with Paine Webber
Inc. in San Francisco, said the new Coke still sold 4 billion cans
last year, which makes it unlikely the company would drop it.
   ``There are people still drinking it,'' he said. ``If they take
it away, they may go somewhere else.''
   Donaldson said taste tests continue to show consumers like new
Coke better than Pepsi.
   Improving the taste was behind the decision to alter the
formula, the company said when it announced the change in April
1985.
   The new Coke hit the stores on May 8 of that year, the 99th
anniversary of the date the first Coca-Cola was sold. But
notwithstanding test results, the backlash was swift and harsh from
consumers who resented the removal of a drink they had enjoyed for
generations.
   Two months later, Coca-Cola apologized to the public and brought
back the old formula as Classic Coke.
   ``There's no question it didn't work out as planned,'' Donaldson
said.
   Still, the bungling hasn't tarnished the vaunted brand name,
Meyers asserts.
   ``In the public's mind, what they call Coke is what the company
is Atlanta calls Coca-Cola Classic,'' he said.

<HEAD>Defense Chief Reiterates Cautions Regarding Gorbachev</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYAN BRUMLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Sunday
restated his view that the United States should be cautious in
reaching an arms accord with the Soviet Union based simply on the
apparent goodwill of Kremlin leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``The U.S. needs to proceed cautiously, conservatively ... and
make certain we are not dealing with a temporary aberration in
Soviet behavior,'' Cheney said in an interview on the ABC-TV
program ``This Week with David Brinkley.''
   Cheney, addressing various aspects of U.S. strategic policy,
said the administration:
   _Refuses to negotiate with the Soviets on the withdrawal of
short-range nuclear weapons from Europe, because it is first
necessary to eliminate the 2-to-1 Warsaw Pact edge in conventional
forces. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose party faces a
tough election next year, has been urging Washington to open such
talks.
   _Will encourage development of democratic governments in
Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe.
   _Places great hope in the eventual development of Star Wars
defenses, although it reduced the budget requested for the
Strategic Defense Initiative from President Reagan's proposal of
$5.8 billion to $4.6 billion next year.
   Cheney sparked a debate in Washington last week by predicting
that Gorbachev's reforms would fail and that he would be replaced
by someone more hostile to the West.
   That observation, repeated three times over the course of a
week, prompted President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker
III to declare that they hoped Gorbachev's reforms would succeed.
   Cheney said Sunday that he thought his remarks ``got
overplayed.''
   Even so, full details of the new administration policy toward
Moscow remained unclear.
   Baker was expected to disclose the administration's arms control
stance this week during a visit to Moscow. In a speech last week,
Baker echoed Cheney's cautious attitude, noting that ``the Soviets
continue to pose a significant military threat to Western
interests.''
   Cheney said Sunday that ``the key emphasis on arms control in
Europe ought to be on conventional force reductions _ that the
Soviets retain an overwhelming conventional superiority.''
   He ruled out talks on short-range nuclear missiles before the
conclusion of ongoing conventional arms talks, in which both sides
have proposed sharp cuts that would end Soviet-bloc numerical
superiority in tanks and troops in Central Europe.
   ``We do not foresee a set of circumstances in which you would
have U.S. troops deployed in Western Europe, where you would not
also have as a significant component of deterrence, nuclear weapons
_ short-range nuclear forces. That's a fact of life,'' said Cheney.
   In related developments, two leading Democrats in Congress and
the chief arms control aide to then-President Reagan urged the Bush
administration to take a more flexible approach in negotiating with
the Soviets.
   The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Aspin,
D-Wis., urged the administration to consider ``mandate talks'' with
the Soviets to decide how to deal with the issue of short-range
nuclear missiles in Europe.
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., said he did not think ``we can
sustain the position that we will not negotiate on the short-range
nuclear weapons.'' Hamilton proposed that any reductions be linked
to cuts in Soviet conventional forces.
   Paul Nitze, who served as Reagan's senior arms control adviser,
said he did not see how the West German government could agree to
the dual policy of the Bush administration, urging modernization of
the short-range Lance missile while refusing to enter talks with
the Soviets on that class of weapons.
   Aspin and Nitze both appeared on ABC-TV. Hamilton appeared on
the NBC-TV show, ``Meet the Press.''

<TEXT>
   As Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
begins her sixth month in office, she faces rising domestic
opposition that is undermining her power in the four provinces.
   The squabbling has interfered with her push to implement a
populist socio-economic program focused on local projects to
improve health, education and public works.
   Ms. Bhutto, 35, was sworn in as prime minister Dec. 2 to become
the first woman leader in the modern Moslem world. Her Pakistan
People's Party was popularly elected Nov. 16 in Pakistan's first
free election in more than a decade.
   She rode a wave of sympathy for her father, Prime Minister
Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, deposed by Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in 1977
and later executed on charges of conspiracy to murder a political
opponent. Zia died in a plane crash in August 1988.
   Ms. Bhutto's opponents have done a great deal to curb the
sympathy wave since her election.
   She ranks a close second in popularity, after bipartisan
President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, according to a recent Gallup Poll
conducted among Pakistan's urban dwellers.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Bhutto's nemesis is her opponents in the
provincial governments, who either are challenging her leadership
or deserting coalitions headed by her party, which she describes as
a social democratic party.
   The Pakistan People's Party, aided by smaller parties and
independents, still controls the powerful National Assembly, or
lower house of parliament, but the provincial skirmishes already
have limited her political and economic options.
   In Punjab, the biggest and richest province and home to 56
percent of the population, Ms. Bhutto mounted two major asssaults
by moving a vote of no confidence against right-wing Chief Minister
Nawaz Sharif in the provincial legislative assembly. Both attempts
fell short of a majority.
   Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League is the linchpin of the
nationwide, eight-party Islamic Democratic Alliance.
   ``Bhutto wants to do away with all of her opponents in order to
create one-party rule in Pakistan,'' charged Sharif.
   In volatile Sindh, the southern province the Bhuttos call home,
Chief Minister Syed Qaim Ali Shah of the Pakistan Peoples Party
commands 84 of 114 votes in the legislative assembly.
   But after months of squabbling, a 28-member group called Mohajir
Qaumi Movement consisting of Moslem immigrants from India pulled
out of the coalition May 1.
   ``Shah failed to protect the lives of immigrant students and
(mohajir) population, which is facing violence by the local
population in numerous cities,'' said Azim Tariq, chief of the
Moslem party.
   Newspaper reports say that mohajirs, fearing violence from
native Sindhis, are deserting their villages and towns and
migrating to major cities such as Karachi and Hyderabad.
   The powerful and vocal mohajir movement can cause Ms. Bhutto's
party plenty of trouble.
   She is upset by recurrent violence in Sindh.
   ``There is a mini-insurgency,'' she said in a recent speech. It
is like ``a crushed egg, which needs delicate handling to bring it
into its original shape.''
   Ethnic riots involving the mohajirs and other groups have left
nearly 700 dead since 1985.
   Ms. Bhutto's provincial coalition Cabinet in North West Frontier
Province along the Afghanistan border collapsed on April 27 when
the pro-Soviet Awami (People's) National Party pulled out.
   Leaders of that party said she reneged on a promise to give them
the provincial governorship in exchange for their role as a
coalition partner.
   ``Bhutto failed to keep each one of her promises,'' said Nasim
Wali Khan, a veteran women's leader of the party.
   Ms. Bhutto's provincial Chief Minister Aftab Ahmad Sherpao still
has support of 37 legislators _ the largest single bloc _ in a
house of 86 after the 14-member Awami National Party quit. However,
opponents in Ms. Bhutto's party warn that the future loyalties of
10 of Sherpao's supporters can waver.
   The southwestern province of Baluchistan, also bordering
Afghanistan, is in the hands of another group of Bhutto opponents,
led by Nawab Akbar Bugti. Bugti is the provincial chief minister
and leader of the Baluchistan National Alliance.
   He is supported by the Islamic Democratic Alliance in addition
to the right-wing Jamaat-e-Ulema-e-Islam (Islamic Scholars Party).
The groups are peeved at Ms. Bhutto's refusal to give Baluchistan a
larger share of federal tax revenues and royalties on oil and
natural gas produced in the province.
   Pakistan is facing a 12 percent annual inflation rate, compared
to 5 percent last year. The prices of some essential goods have
gone up 18 percent.
   A wage hike will push prices up further and enlarge the current
$2.75 billion federal budget deficit. It equals about 6.7 percent
of Pakistan's gross domestic product.
   The next national budget, due June 1, may fuel more inflation as
independent economists fear more taxes across the board.

   Having breakfast with the ``god of
thunder'' may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's just what John
Fitzpatrick wanted.
   ``God of thunder'' in this case is a hairy,
not-quite-2-month-old gorilla at the San Francisco Zoo, where it's
the first baby gorilla born in 14 years.
   Fitzpatrick won the zoo's name-that-gorilla contest with his
suggestion that the cuddly little fellow should be named Shango,
which means ``god of thunder'' among the Yoruba-speaking people of
Nigeria. His idea beat more than 100 other entries.
   Senior primate keeper Carol Martinez said last week that the
name Shango was chosen because a troop of gorillas was recently
discovered in Nigeria, where the name originates.
   She said gorillas were thought to be extinct there ``and this
discovery is a hopeful sign for the survival of the lowland
gorilla.''
   As his prize for naming Shango, Fitzpatrick will breakfast soon
with the little one, mama Bawang and daddy Mkubwa. He'll get to eat
at a table set up in a part of the gorilla building not open to the
public that gives a great view of the primates, the zoo said.

   The doghouse or the henhouse? Foghorn
is a bit confused about home.
   The rooster has turned up his beak at the hens on Polly
Johnson's farm to share a large, turned-over barrel with a
friendly, female mutt named Muffin.
   ``What we have here is a pretty unnatural situation,'' Mrs.
Johnson said.
   Foghorn is a silky rooster rather than one of the more popular
varieties of farm roosters, such as Rhode Island Red, she said. His
feathers are unique _ ``more like hair,'' she said. ``Maybe that's
why he thinks he belongs in the doghouse instead of the henhouse.''
   Muffin, a medium-sized dog with German shepherd features,
doesn't seem to mind the company. The two are pals and sleep
together in the barrel turned on its side that serves as Muffin's
home.
   Mrs. Johnson tried to confine the rooster with the hens after
she was given Foghorn this spring, but he wouldn't have anything to
do with his own kind and soon sought out the dog.
   ``He doesn't seem to care a thing about the hens,'' Mrs. Johnson
said.
   Muffin recently got away from her feathered companion long
enough to mate with her own species. She's the mother of a new
litter.
   ``When it comes to dogs, people will believe about anything, but
they won't believe ... Muffin and Foghorn until they see it,'' Mrs.
Johnson said. ``After they see it, they get a funny look on their
face.''

   A mock electric chair, pastel
placemats, art deco furniture and other props from the ``Miami
Vice'' television series were bought up by fans who clamored for a
piece of the show even before its final episode.
   ``It's better to sell everything, and everybody gets a little
piece of the show,'' Cici Kelly, the show's location auditor, said
Saturday. ``There's a lot of junk, but they're buying it.''
   The final scenes for the hit series, which began in 1984 and
made Don Johnson and pastel men's suits famous, were filmed April
27. The last episode, its plot a closely guarded secret, is due to
be broadcast May 21.
   A cramped warehouse held what was left of props used in the 108
episodes of MTV-era detective show. People carted away voodoo
statues, Santeria candles, Rolodexes and anything else they could
carry.
   Hundreds of pink flamingos and briefcases, one riddled with
bullet holes, were hot items.
   ``Everybody _ like madness _ went right to the flamingos,'' said
Bob Lacey, the show's Emmy Award-winning set decorator.
   The items had been destined to be shipped to Universal Studios
in Los Angeles, but Kelly said it was better to sell the items to
the people of Miami. The money raised from the giant garage sale
will be credited to the show, she said.
   ``People feel united _ that `Miami Vice' was really a part of
Miami instead of just using Miami,'' said Linda Isaacs, 45 of North
Miami Beach. She dragged away a blanket stuffed with placemats,
pillows and other items she will use to decorate her home.
   Allan Rosenbaum, 48, of Miami paid $100 for the gray, metal desk
that was used in the show by Ricardo Tubbs, played by Philip
Michael Thomas. The desk used by Sonny Crockett, played by Johnson,
was already sold.
   ``It's just an old, junky desk. ... I don't need any new
desks,'' Rosenbaum said. ``We got it as a sentimental sort of
thing.''
   Michelle and Terry VanDerMark carted away a box of stuff on an
old red wheelchair. VanDerMark, 45 of Portland, Ore., said he's
never seen the show.
   ``We're not buying it because of the show. We're buying it
because it's good junk,'' he said,
   After five years, Lacey said he felt odd watching the items he
purchased for the show being sold.
   ``I got a little goose bumpy,'' Lacey said. ``It was a good way
to go out.''

<HEAD>Injuries Rising in Violent Crimes, Report Shows</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN SKORNECK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The percentage of victims of rape, robbery and
assault who were physically injured during the attack increased
from 1979 to 1986, according to a Department of Justice survey.
   Caroline Wolf Harlow, the statistician who prepared the report
issued Sunday, said that although violent crime rates dropped about
11 percent from 1973 to 1986, the number of injuries _ about 2.2
million a year _ did not.
   ``Since injuries have remained relatively constant over the
period, a higher proportion of victims of violent crime today are
injured,'' she said.
   The report covered only rape, robbery and assault for people at
least 12 years old. It did not cover murder, manslaughter and child
abuse.
   The report was based on findings of the National Crime Survey,
which questioned an average of 116,000 respondents in 55,000
households in each year of the survey. The results include crimes
not reported to police.
   Because of the large percentage of people questioned each year
compared with the total number of crime victims, the results are
not subject to the margin of error limitations of a smaller poll.
   Over the years 1979-1986, a total of about 63 million people in
the United States were victims of rape, robbery or assault, of whom
17.7 million were injured, the report concluded.
   Of the average 2.2 million people hurt each year, 357,830
suffered serious injury and 1.83 million suffered minor injury.
About 1 percent or almost 23,000 people suffered gunshot wounds,
about 77,000 had knife wounds, 141,500 suffered broken bones or
teeth, 64,000 had internal injuries and 84,000 lost consciousness,
according to the report.
   The percentage of victims who were injured during the attack was
27.5 percent in 1973 and remained relatively constant except for a
drop to 26.9 percent in 1982 before climbing the next few years to
30.3 percent in 1986, Ms. Harlow said in an interview, citing
figures not included in the report, which covered only 1979-86.
   The actual rate of violent crime, that is, the number of victims
of rape, robbery or assault per 1,000 people, decreased
substantially in the last few years of the survey, she said.
   The highest rate since 1973 was in 1981, when 45.6 per 1,000
were victims of such crimes. That number dropped to 36.7 per 1,000
in 1986, but preliminary figures for 1987 and 1988 indicate the
rate has increased again, Ms. Harlow said.
   Meanwhile, the injury rate _ the number of people per 1,000 who
suffered injuries as victims of those violent crimes _ stayed
relatively stable. In 1973, the rate was 11.4 per 1,000. It rose to
a high of 12.7 in 1981 and then dropped to 11.1 in 1986, she said.
   Neither Ms. Harlow nor the report she compiled gave reasons for
the 1981 spike in crime and injury rates.
   While almost half of the injured victims received some medical
care, including almost a fourth being treated in an emergency room
or hospital, one in 25, a total of about 87,650 people, needed to
stay overnight in the hospital, the report found.
   Those most likely to suffer injuries were men, blacks, people
age 19 to 24, people with at most a high school education, those
who were separated or divorced, poor people with family incomes
under $10,000 a year and residents of central cities.
   Those least likely to be injured were women, whites, widows,
those 50 or older, people with family incomes of $30,000 or more,
those who had attended college for a year or more and those who
lived outside metropolitan areas.

<HEAD>Beach Owners Reject Opening of Land They Fought to Control</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WELLS, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody Beach property owners, who won a court
battle over control of access to the mile-long stretch of sandy
shore, reacted angrily Sunday as town officials proposed that the
beach be reopened to the public anyway.
   ``I object to allowing hordes of people to come onto my
property,'' landowner Andy Galt said at a special meeting called by
Town Manager Jonathan Carter. ``This is private land. Every one of
us knows that.''
   Even though the town of Wells and the state attorney general's
office were the losers in late March when the Maine Supreme Court
ruled that the property owners can bar the public from the beach,
Carter told landowners Sunday that the town would agree to maintain
the beach if it could be opened to the public.
   ``The town will comply with the court decision,'' Carter said.
``In the short term, we want to see ... if the property owners
would consider opening it up for the summer, the summer of 1989.''
   The town is seeking an appraisal of the beach to consider taking
it through eminent domain, and Carter found no enthusiasm for his
proposal to keep the beach public in the meantime.
   ``I don't feel that you people considered that these are
individual pieces of land,'' property owner Dorothy Jones said.
``We are not operating as a country club group or a condominium
group. I may decide on Tuesday I'll let everybody there. On
Wednesday, I may get up grumpy and say, `Nobody.' I intend to keep
that right.''
   Sandy shore is rare in Maine, making up just 35 miles of the
3,500-mile meandering coastline, which is mostly rocky.
   The divided supreme court ruled in March that the only public
access right to the beach was granted in a 17th century colonial
ordinance that permits access for fishing, bird hunting and boating.
   Mrs. Jones and other Moody Beach owners complained that for
years, thousands of tourists have come to the beach without
respecting their property.
   The landowners asked town selectmen Sunday whether it would be
possible to stop local motels and campgrounds from bringing in
tourists on buses, but Town Attorney Gordon Ayer said there would
be constitutional problems with such a ban.
   After the landowners made it clear they would not consider
opening the beach to the public, Carter said that the town will
abide by the court ruling. But he has said it will be difficult to
keep tourists away.

<TEXT>
   Syrian and Christian gunners blasted
residential districts of Beirut on Sunday in savage artillery duels
that killed at least 20 people as the Arab League moved quickly to
try to revive a collapsed truce.
   A police spokesman said 100 people were wounded in a seven-hour
bombardment that left the streets blanketed with debris.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named under standing regulations,
said about 20,000 shells and rockets were unleashed on the divided
capital and surrounding areas.
   Fires burned out of control in both Moslem and Christian
sectors. Hundreds of charred cars smoldered in parking lots, and
severed power cables dangled from twisted poles or shell-pocked
apartment buildings.
   ``Almost every district, every street and every alley is
shelled. The capital looks like it has been struck by a killer
earthquake,'' the spokesman said.
   Blazing pine trees lit up the night sky as Christian artillery
positions began the exchange by firing 155mm howitzers at Syrian
and Druse positions across Beirut and neighboring hills.
   The Syrians responded with rocket fire at Christian east Beirut,
the city's port, the Christian harbors of Jounieh and Byblos, and a
cluster of deserted summer resorts in Lebanon's central mountains.
   The deaths and woundings increased the overall toll to 298
killed and 1,111 wounded since the latest round of fighting in
Lebanon's 14-year-old civil war broke out March 8.
   The fighting pits army commander Gen. Michel Aoun's 20,000
mainly Christian soldiers against an alliance of Syrian troops and
7,000 militiamen of Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive
Socialist Party.
   The Christians resumed shelling Saturday night after nine days
of unanswered Syrian attacks on the Christian sector's coast. Those
attacks were in defiance of an April 28 cease-fire called by the
Arab League.
   Aoun told the U.S., British and French ambassadors on Saturday
night that he would respond to the Syrian fire, a spokesman for his
headquarters said. An hour later, the Christian firing began.
   The Syrians and their allies have said they will keep shelling
until the Arab League dispatches a multinational 321-man observer
force to monitor the truce. They want the observer force in place
to prevent arms from reaching Aoun's forces.
   But the current escalation threatened to block the arrival of
the observer force under the command of Kuwaiti Brig. Gen. Ali
Al-Momen. It will be drawn from the armies of Jordan, Kuwait,
Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan and North Yemen.
   Arab League Secretary-General Chedli Klibi sent fresh appeals
Sunday to Aoun and to acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss to ``spare
no effort to restore the cease-fire and enable the observers to
deploy within the next few days.''
   Klibi also immediately dispatched his deputy, Kakhadar Ibrahimi,
back to Damascus and Beirut to resume his peacemaking mission,
sources at the Arab League's Tunis headquarters said.
   A mediation panel set up by the Arab League in January has made
four cease-fire calls. All have collapsed, although the league had
promised this last one would be different because it would be
monitored by the observer force.
   When the shelling slackened at dawn, tens of thousands of dazed
residents emerged from underground bunkers to assess damage, buy
food and water, and hurry back to the shelters.
   ``The executioners of Beirut are going to resume their moronic
bombardment,'' said Leila Taleb, a Moslem housewife holding her
2-month-old baby and carrying a supply of of powdered milk.
   Among those inspecting the damage was Hoss, who heads a mostly
Moslem Cabinet competing with Aoun's Christian Cabinet.
   ``No words are enough to describe this horror,'' Hoss told
reporters as he toured the battered two-story prime ministry. ``I
repeat my plea for a total cessation of hostilities out of mercy
for the innocent population.''
   One shell devastated Defense Minister Adel Osseiran's office in
the prime ministry building in Moslem west Beirut's commercial
Hamra district.
   The latest fighting erupted after Aoun, in a bid to reassert
state authority, clamped a blockade on three illegal ports run by
Moslem militias south of Beirut.
   Jumblatt retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of the capital. The Syrians later joined the fighting.
   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops across almost 70 percent of
Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate.
   Aoun said the Syrians lost their credibility as neutral
peacekeepers by siding with the Moslems.
   Lebanon's rival governments emerged in September when outgoing
President Amin Gemayel appointed Aoun to rule pending Parliament's
election of a new head of state. Moslems and leftists rejected the
appointment.

<HEAD>Bush's Explanation of Iran-Contra Role Unsatisfactory, Congressman
Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House committee that
investigated the Iran-Contra scandal on Sunday labeled as
unsatisfactory President Bush's explanation of his role in an
arrangement to provide the Nicaraguan rebels with aid.
   ``I'm not satisfied with his answers,'' said Rep. Lee Hamilton,
D-Ind. ``I think we need to know a lot more about ... then-Vice
President Bush's activities.''
   On Thursday, the same day a jury returned its verdict in Oliver
North's trial, Bush said ``there was no quid pro quo'' arrangement
discussed in his meeting in early 1985 with Honduran President
Roberto Suazo.
   Documents introduced during North's trial indicated that
President Reagan approved a deal in 1985 in which U.S. military and
economic aid to Honduras would be expedited in return for Honduran
aid to the Contras.
   At the time, Congress had banned U.S. aid to the Contras, who
were camped just inside Honduras' border with Nicaragua.
   Hamilton, appearing on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' cited past
White House denials of arms sales to Iran and of Central
Intelligence Agency involvement in supplying the Contras with aid _
allegations that later proved to be true.
   ``I'm skeptical,'' he said, regarding Bush's denial Thursday of
talking with Suazo about any arrangement to indirectly funnel aid
to the Contras. ``That's the whole story of Iran-Contra, I think.
I'm bound to be skeptical of what the executive branch has said to
me.''
   Hamilton said the documents in North's trial ``show that we
contacted Honduras, we increased aid to Honduras and Honduras, in
return, aided the Contras.''
   ``Those documents are about as clear a statement of quid pro quo
as you will ever see...'' he said. ``They are contrary to what the
president says; we ought to pursue them.''
   However, there is no immediate need to recovene the House and
Senate Iran-Contra committees, Hamilton said. The next step, he
said, is for the intelligence panels of both bodies to obtain the
documents and examine them.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, called new efforts to link Bush to the
Iran-Contra affair ``a bad mistake, not only in terms of foreign
policy, but just in terms of general public policy in this
country.''
   ``Throughout the entire period of the Reagan administration, we
were giving a lot of assistance to Honduras,'' he said. ``And we
did so simply because they were very helpful to our foriegn policy
and the prosecution of what we were doing in Nicaragua.''

   A boys-only contest sponsored by Apple
Computer, which offered a week at a basketball camp run by Los
Angeles Laker Magic Johnson, was opened to girls when officials
called it discriminatory.
   Apple announced late last week that girls could join the ``Magic
of Apple'' contest and attend the camp if they win. Drawings were
being held in computer stores in several Southern California
counties to determine the winners.
   Feminist attorney Gloria Allred called the boys-only contest
unlawful, and Marian Johnston, civil rights supervisor at the state
Justice Department, also said the contest was discriminatory.
   ``I'm glad someone brought it up to them,'' said Lon Rosen,
co-owner of the Magic Johnson camp. ``If girls want to get into the
Magic Johnson camp, we obviously will allow them.''
   Girls have attended the camp in the past, he said. Sharon
Stevenson, an Apple staff member who coordinated advertising for
the contest, said she had not known that the basketball camp
admitted girls.

<DATELINE>TORIT, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The relief plane executed a corkscrew dive
in case of missile attack, leveled off and landed in Torit, a
once-bustling southern town transformed by civil war and fa mine
into a dusty rebel outpost.
   Shoeless young men, wearing only tattered shorts and glistening
with sweat, unloaded the 14 tons of maize. It was the plane's
second delivery of the day.
   Under the shade of a mango tree beyond a ridge of earthen
fortifications, rebels in army fatigues and civilians in ragged
clothing relaxed and watched what has become a regular exercise.
   The airlift is part of a program coordinated by the United
Nations to save 100,000 southern Sudanese from starvation by
stocking food throughout the region before the annual rains, which
begin this month and will make roads and airstrips unusable.
   Operation Lifeline-Sudan, begun April 1 and expected to cost
$132 million, is intended to prevent a repeat of last year's
disaster.
   The director of the operation said Sunday that it was well
behind schedule but ``virtually certain'' to stave off massive
starvation.
   ``The back of the disaster has been broken,'' the director,
James P. Grant, told a Nairobi news conference.
   He said about 45,000 tons of food and supplies has been moved
into southern Sudan and another 50,000 tons is expected to be moved
into the region by the end of June.
   The operation's deadline was pushed back a month due to the
delays and will continue to deliver food into southern Sudan
through the rainy season, said Grant.
   Deliveries could not begin until the government and rebels
agreed to suspend fighting along specified ``corridors of
tranquility'' along which the food and other supplies could move.
Aid is being sent to both rebel-held areas and those controlled by
the army.
   A monthlong truce followed the initial agreement, but the
original goal of stockpiling 170,000 tons of supplies in the south
still is unlikely to be achieved.
   Relief officials say as many as 500,000 people died of drought,
flood and famine exacerbated by the 6-year-old war between the army
and the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army led by former Col.
John Garang.
   Most southern Sudanese are black, predominantly Christian or
animist. Garang and his rebel army are fighting for autonomy and a
better economic deal from the government in the Arab, Moslem north.
   No one knows for sure how many of Torit's 30,000 people perished
before rebel fighters drove out the last soldiers in February,
ending a yearlong siege of this river town ringed by the jagged
Imatong Mountains. U.N. officials estimate up to 1,000 died each
month.
   Rebels found fewer than 1,000 civilians remaining in the town's
huts of mud and thatch, relief officials said. The rest had died or
fled into the bush to escape the war and to forage for food.
   Residents who stayed or have returned since February say they
were denied any of the supplies government soldiers received
through army airdrops and survived on mangoes and a clover-like
weed the local Latuga tribe calls ogasik.
   Laudina Legga, 28, said 15 members of her family starved to
death before she, her mother and her two children fled to the bush
early this year.
   ``We ate only ogasik for nine months,'' she said in a
conversation on a dirt road. Ms. Legga was returning home from the
relief plane with a basket of maize balanced on her head.
   She and the others returned to Torit at the end of April, lured
by the new security and growing stocks of food. The United Nations
says about 20,000 people have come back to the town and surrounding
area since the rebels took control.
   Many huts still appeared empty during a tour of the town. People
interviewed seemed in good health and relatively well-fed.
   Olaug Husby, one of three Norwegian Church Aid health workers
based in Torit, said the apparent lack of hunger was partly due to
resumed harvesting of food from the countryside. Other relief
officials said the people may not have been as desperate this year
as had been thought.
   Whatever the explanation, ``they are not starving now,'' said
Ben Martinson, a U.N. representative coordinating storage in Torit.
   He said some of the relief food had been distributed but most
would be stockpiled for the rainy season, when floods normally
isolate Torit until November.
   U.N. officials expect the town's population to reach 50,000,
with the influx of refugees, and plan to stock 8,000 tons of food.
Martinson said about a quarter of that had been delivered by May 1,
two weeks after airlifts and road convoys started moving from
Uganda and Kenya.
   Convoys from Kenya were suspended May 1, three days after the
second attack along the road. Eight rebel escorts were killed April
18, when a missile destroyed the lead vehicle in the first attack
on a relief convoy.
   Martinson said he suspected the raids were carried out by
tribesmen in the area or by Ugandan insurgents who had filtered
into southern Sudan.

<TEXT>
   Voters in lines that snaked across an
empty lot Sunday were not discouraged by a hot tropical sun as they
waited patiently to cast their ballots in Panama's second
presidential election in 21 years.
   Some brought parasols or even chairs for the wait. Others turned
out before dawn, two hours before polls opened at 7 a.m., while
still others just sweated in the sun.
   ``Everybody votes in the morning, then goes home to wait,'' said
Nellida Galvez, an opposition party pollwatcher.
   Voting was slowed by late-opening polls, careful checks of
booths by pollwatchers and the somewhat cumbersome process of
casting ballots. But voters remained in the long lines.
   Election officials sat at a rough wooden table with party
pollwatchers arrayed behind them at ballot box 2742, inside one of
seven sheds placed on a dusty lot in downtown Panama City.
   Voters stepped up to the bench and proferred their identity
cards, which were checked and punched. A man whose ID card did not
quite match the registration list was allowed to cast his ballot
after a quick discussion among poll officials and pollwatchers.
   ``We all know each other here,'' said one official. ``The
instructions say to assume minor problems are just mistakes or
typos.''
   The turnout at 2742, as at others throughout the nation, was
extremely heavy. By 8 a.m. more than 100 of the 348 people assigned
to the station were in line, but only 20 people had voted.
   ``I've been on line an hour and it looks like I have another
hour to wait,'' said Felipe Reynaud, his skin shiny with sweat.
``But I'm going to vote.''
   At one voting station, acting president Manuel Solis Palma was
greeted with a mixture of boos and cheers.
   Opposition presidential candidate Guillermo Endara appeared at
another polling booth and was greeted by a joyous, chanting crowd.
   It was a calm Sunday, and Panama City's streets were almost
entirely empty. No liquor sales were permitted between noon
Saturday and midnight Sunday.
   U.S.-style ballots are not used in the voting process in Panama.
Voters are given an empty envelope when they enter a booth. Inside
are stacks of colored cards for each candidate. A voter puts the
cards of the candidates he supports into the envelope, then
deposits the envelope into a cardboard urn.
   Loud cheers broke out when a woman who had taken fully five
minutes to complete the process finally emerged. Poll officials
brought forward the elderly and the handicapped, saying they did
not have to wait in line.
   Complaints were minor. Voters at one booth said they tried to
disguise their motions as they selected their cards because the
curtain was too short and allowed officials to see inside.
   Pollwatchers at box 2742 complained that the booth's light bulb
had been stolen, which would complicate the initial count after
polls close at 5 p.m.
   ``I'll get a flashlight,'' said Ricardo Duran, another
opposition pollwatcher.
   ``No, I'll have my father bring a light bulb from home,'' said
Galvez.

   Iranian President Ali Khamenei on Sunday
indirectly endorsed as his successor Parliament speaker Hashemi
Rafsanjani, who has urged a terror campaign against Westerners to
avenge the deaths of Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied lands.
   Khamenei also backed constitutional reforms that are expected to
give the president more executive power, said Iran's official
Islamic Republic News Agency.
   The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Khamenei as telling
worshipers in Tehran, ``Fortunately, the people's attention has
naturally been drawn to one of the most prominent faces of the
Islamic Republic.''
   Khamenei did not mention Rafsanjani by name but made an obvious
reference to him, saying: ``The candidate that some groups have
identified for the presidency revives this hope in us that, God
willing, our nation will have a much brighter future.''
   Rafsanjani, 54, one of Iran's most prominent political
personalities, is the only declared candidate so far in
presidential elections scheduled for late summer. Two influential
clerical groups, one composed of hardliners and the other of
liberal theologians, have said they will back the parliament
speaker.
   Khamenei, a longtime political ally of Rafsanjani, made the
endorsement during a sermon to mark the Eid al-Fitr feast that ends
the Moslem holy month of Ramadan.
   ``God willing, this year the matter of the presidency will be
good news for our people,'' he said.
   Under the 1980 constitution, the 50-year-old president cannot
run for a third four-year term.
   Rafsanjani, who also serves as acting commander of the armed
forces, earned a reputation as a moderate through his support for
rebuilding ties with Western nations. He hoped to speed
reconstruction of the country after the eight-year-long Persian
Gulf war, halted by a U.N.-mediated cease-fire on Aug. 20.
   But he recently changed tack, supporting Iranian leader
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei's Feb. 14 call for the death of British
author Salman Rushdie.
   And in an inflammatory speech broadcast Friday, Rafsanjani said
five American, French or British citizens should be killed in
retaliation for each Arab slain in the uprising in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. He urged Palestinians to
hijack planes or blow up factories in Western countries in order to
pressure Israel to release prisoners.
   Last month, Rafsanjani backed a decision by Khomeini to amend
the constitution and said he hoped the reforms would give the next
president more power.
   Executive power is divided between Khamenei and Prime Minister
Hussein Musavi. Khomeini has the last word in decision-making as
the country's spiritual leader.
   But the prime minister holds more authority than the president,
and Khamenei has said that must be rectified if Iran is to have a
strong government.
   Khomeini appointed a 20-man committee to revise the
constitution, which must then be approved by the people in a
referendum.
   Both Rafsanjani and Khamenei are committee members. Analysts
have speculated the committee may suggest the prime minister's job
be abolished altogether.
   In his sermon, Khamenei was quoted as saying a stronger
presidency and constitutional reforms would allow ``greater room
for realizing the nation's potential.''
   Also Sunday, the president opened the Tehran International Book
Fair with an attack on the West for supporting Rushdie's book ``The
Satanic Verses,'' the official news agency reported.
   ``We can see how colonialist hands are supporting a writer and
publishers who have insulted the sanctities of 1 billion Moslems,''
the agency quoted Khamenei as saying.
   The book prompted worldwide protests by Moslems, who view it as
blasphemous. Rushdie has been in hiding since Khomeini called for
his death.
   The news agency said despite a boycott by some Western
publishers, 237 foreign publishers and 270 local companies are
participating in the 12-day fair.

   The body of an Israeli paratrooper sergeant who
was missing since Feb. 16 was found Sunday buried near the occupied
Gaza Strip, and Israeli officials accused Palestinian guerrillas of
killing him.
   Hundreds of angry Israelis gathered outside the victim's home in
the port city of Ashdod, shouting ``Death to the Arabs!''
   Israel radio said some Israelis attacked an Arab laborer at a
nearby grocery store. It said police rescued the Arab and sealed
off the area.
   Also Sunday, Arab hospital officials said 15 Palestinians were
shot and wounded in clashes with soldiers, despite widespread
curfews ordering 450,000 Palestinians to stay in their homes.
   Twelve of the wounded were shot in clashes in Rafah, Gaza City
and three refugee camps, the hospital officials said. They said at
least three were shot in the occupied West Bank. The army said it
had no reports of woundings.
   The slain soldier, Avi Sassportaz, 21, disappeared after leaving
his southern base for his home. He was last seen hitchhiking at a
junction about 10 miles from the Gaza Strip.
   ``There is no doubt it's homicide. Preliminary findings show he
was shot,'' an army spokesman said. Israel radio, however, said a
knife was found near the body.
   The radio said Sassportaz was found when private investigators
who were searching for stolen cars in a helicopter landed and
spotted a hand sticking out of the ground.
   The army, backed by police and volunteers, had searched
extensively for Sassportaz since his disappearance. At one point,
the search covered 200 square miles and involved 22,500 people.
   Late in February, a caller claiming to represent the Palestinian
Arab Army, a previously unknown group, told the Agence France
Presse news agency and Israel radio the group was holding
Sassportaz. It demanded the release of 1,500 Palestinians.
   Meanwhile, some 1,300 soldiers carried out a massive search in
the area north of Gaza for another Israeli soldier believed
kidnapped.
   The soldier, Ilan Saadon, 18, was last seen Wednesday getting
into a white car driven by men wearing skullcaps of observant Jews.
   ``We don't know if there is a link, whether this (was done by)
the same guerrilla group,'' Police Minister Chaim Bar-Lev told
Israel radio. ``So far, he is missing.''
   ``This disguise, passing off as religious people, we are
familiar with this technique,'' he added.
   Saadon's tearful mother said on Israel Television that ``This
boy is my soul...I'm only asking God to let him come back in
peace.''
   Sassportaz's death raised to 21 the number of Israelis killed in
the 17-month Arab uprising, along with 465 Palestinians.
   The army said Sunday its investigation of Saturday's clashes in
the Gaza Strip showed two Palestinians were killed and 77 wounded
as soldiers opened fire to quell protests on Eid Al-Fitr, a major
Moslem holiday.
   Arab hospital officials reported three killed and 135 injured in
the Saturday violence. The toll of wounded was the highest in a
single day in Gaza since the start of the uprising.
   In Tel Aviv, Chief Military Spokesman Brig. Gen. Ephraim Lapid
defended the army against Palestinians' charges that the presence
of soldiers outside a mosque in the Nusseirat refugee camp provoked
the clashes Saturday.
   ``The local people in Gaza ... searched for confrontation with
Israeli soldiers.''
   According to Arab reports, the trouble Saturday began as Moslems
leaving morning prayers found about 100 soldiers waiting outside
the mosque. Stone-throwing started and the troops opened fire.
   Also in the West Bank, Jewish settlers announced they founded a
new settlement near Nahalin, the Arab village where five
Palestinians were killed last month in one of the worst
confrontations with Israeli forces in the uprising.
   More than 70,000 Israelis already live in about 130 settlements
among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands. The U.S.
government has called the settlements an obstacle to peace.

<HEAD>Country Music Star's Jet Seized After Brief, Profanity-Filled Appearance</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Note 2nd graf. Roxson cq in 12th graf.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at a concert arena got an
order seizing Hank Williams Jr.'s private jet Sunday to cover
expenses of a brief, profanity-filled appearance in which the
country music star failed to finish a single song.
   But a spokesman for the singer said Williams, 39, was sorry
about Saturday night's concert at the Baton Rouge Centroplex and
would put everything right.
   After the concert ended, a few among the 7,000 concert-goers
threw bottles and tried to burn souvenir T-shirts, said police, but
there were no injuries or arrests reported. Damage to the building
was described as minor.
   Michael M. Pierce, director of the 11,000-seat arena, said the
singer ``would do three or four bars ... and then use some
profanity and say `We don't need this song,' and then immediately
sing something else.''
   After about 20 minutes during which he talked incoherently and
attempted several songs, Williams threw his fiddle into the air and
stumbled offstage, helped by members of his entourage, witnesses
said.
   Fans had been told by a member of Williams entourage that they
could get their money back at the box office, but the box office
didn't have that kind of cash on hand, Pierce said.
   ``The folks were aggravated,'' said Police Chief Wayne Rogillio.
``We understood it. All we tried to do was try contain them from
damaging anybody or anything. I think we were successful to some
extent.''
   Williams, who was voted Academy of Country Music entertainer of
the year three times, was apologetic and promised to pay for ticket
refunds, other expenses and any profit the arena would have made,
spokesman Kent Arwood said Sunday.
   Arwood, interviewed by telephone from his home in Nashville,
said the incident was caused by a personal problem he would not
disclose, and bore no relationship to the incident last month in
which Williams stormed offstage 40 minutes into a concert in
Bristol, Tenn.
   Arwood said several times that Williams is not an alcoholic and
that a problem he had acknowledge having with pills is a thing of
the past. His father, the famous country singer-songwriter Hank
Williams Sr., died in 1953 at age 29 of the effects of alcohol
abuse.

<HEAD>Mayors Chosen in San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth; El Paso Race In
Runoff</HEAD>

   A former San Antonio mayor has her old job
back and the mayors in Fort Worth and Dallas have been returned to
office by wide margins.
   In El Paso, two council members will face each other in a May 27
runoff to determine who will lead that struggling border city.
   While former San Antonio Mayor Lila Cockrell, Fort Worth Mayor
Bob Bolen and Dallas Mayor Annette Strauss coasted to easy
victories Saturday, the two El Paso candidates squeaked past four
others to set up the runoff.
   Council members Suzy Azar and Mayor Pro-Tem Ed Elsey will face
each other to determine who will succeed Jonathan Rogers, who by
law could not run for a fifth, two-year term.
   Ms. Azar had 16,220 votes, or 31 percent, compared with 11,930
votes or 23 percent for Elsey. Close beind Elsey was state Rep.
Paul Moreno, with 10,452 or 20 percent. Three other candidates had
a combined 27 percent of the vote.
   In San Antonio, Ms. Cockrell, who was mayor between 1975 and
1981, received 45,300 votes, or 59 percent, from a seven-candidate
field and on June 1 will replace Mayor Henry Cisneros, who chose
not to seek a fifth two-year term.
   Ms. Cockrell's closest challenger, insurance executive Carl S.
Mauthe, received about 31 percent of the vote.
   ``I'm just very, very grateful to the citizens for giving me
this opportunity again and I think it's a matter of my having gone
back to the voters and gotten reacquainted and worked very hard and
offered my services if the voters wished to have me return,'' Ms.
Cockrell said.
   In Dallas, Mrs. Strauss, backed by a huge campaign fund and the
business community, pulled 73 percent of the vote in a race with
three opponents.
   She had garnered 60,895 votes, compared with 17,002 or 20
percent for leading challenger Peter Lesser. The two other
candidates managed no more than 4 percent of the vote each.
   ``The stage is now set for building opportunities, growth and
prosperity and we will all share in the good years that are
ahead,'' Ms. Strauss said.
   In Fort Worth, Bolen was re-elected to his fourth two-year term,
receiving 89 percent of the vote, compared with 7 percent for his
nearest challenger, Evelyn Williams.
   The San Antonio ballot was the first one in 14 years that didn't
include Cisneros, who was a city councilman for six years before
becoming mayor in 1981.
   The popular 41-year-old mayor, beset by a troubled marriage and
his son's ill health, said last fall that he wouldn't run again and
would accept a job in the private sector.

   Less than five months after she gave birth
while in a coma, Barbara Blodgett has composed a poem and is
learning to eat, dress and groom herself.
   In a meeting with reporters Saturday outside the family's rented
home, the 24-year-old woman said little more than ``hi,'' sitting
in a wheelchair with her eyes fixed on her husband, David.
   He said she composed the following poem to him on a computer
keyboard:
   ``I know in my heart what is wrong, what is right
   ``I know in my heart our love is worth the fight
   ``So hold on to me, babe, hold me tight, hold me fast,
   ``I know in my heart our love is going to last.''
   As he sat beside his wife, Blodgett gave a bottle to their son,
Simon, who was born in Seattle by Caesarean section Dec. 9, five
months after Mrs. Blodgett was injured in an automobile accident.
   She was the fourth woman in recorded medical history to carry a
healthy fetus to term while in a coma.
   Mrs. Blodgett was three months pregnant when the vehicle in
which she was riding collided with another vehicle June 30,
injuring nerves between her brain and the spinal cord. Her cousin,
Nicole Valenzuela, was killed.
   Blodgett, who was wearing a seat belt, and David Blodgett III,
then 13 months and strapped into a car seat, escaped injury.
   Doctors had held out little hope that Mrs. Blodgett would
recover, but she began to regain consciousness after her son was
born.
   Since Feb. 14 she has spent most of her time in rehabilitation
therapy at St. Elizabeth Medical Center, visiting her family at
home on weekends.
   A statement issued by hospital officials said she had learned to
eat, was learning to drink liquids and was trying to become mobile
enough to get into and out of bed, dress and groom herself and
perform other functions. She is able to stand only with assistance.
   Now that she has mastered the use of a keyboard, the next step
is learning to use a device that translates typed messages into
human speech.
   Blodgett said he returned to work a month ago after using up
sick leave and vacation time donated by co-workers at the U.S.
Forest Service, where he and his wife worked before the accident.
   ``I've learned a lot more about responsibility,'' he said.
   The other driver, Byron Stackhouse, who was slightly injured,
was convicted of vehicular assault and sentenced to three years in
prison. Testimony indicated his blood alcohol content after the
accident was more than twice the legal threshhold for driving while
intoxicated.

   Assassins shot to death a legislator from the
governing Aprista Party, officials said Sunday. It was the second
such slaying in nine days.
   Pablo Li Ormeno, of the center-left Aprista Party, was shot by
two men Saturday night in Villa El Salvador, a slum on Lima's
outskirts, the government news agency Andina said.
   There was no word on who might have carried out the killing.
   According to the government newspaper La Cronica, Li Ormeno was
in his car in front of a pharmacy and was ordered out by the gunmen.
   The attackers opened fire when the official tried to resist, and
they fled in Li Ormeno's vehicle, La Cronica said.
   On April 27, congressional deputy Eriberto Arroyo of the Marxist
coalition the United Left was killed.
   Police blamed that slaying on the Mao-inspired Shining Path
guerrilla group, but some United Left officials blamed the
anti-rebel death squad the Rodrigo Franco Command.
   The Shining Path denied it killed Arroyo in a rare communique
published in Wednesday's edition of El Diario. Police say the Lima
newspaper El Diario is the voice of the Shining Path.
   Li Ormeno represented the Lima area in the Chamber of Deputies,
equivalent to the U.S. House of Representatives, in Peru's
bicameral legislature.
   Until Li Ormeno's murder, Arroyo had been the only Congress
member and the highest ranking elected official ever slain in
Peru's nine-year insurgency.
   The Shining Path has assassinated scores of politicians during
its nine-year fight to impose Marxist rule. Most of those slain
have been from the ruling party but members of the United Left and
other parties have also been killed.
   The Franco Command surfaced a year ago, vowing to kill leftist
guerrillas and their supporters.
   Opposition charges that the Franco Command is linked to the
Aprista Party have been denied by government officials.

   Meanwhile, the Dallas Times Herald reported Sunday that during a
time when Wright owned stock in a company with Canadian energy
interests, he urged Cabinet members to consider retaliating against
Canada if it put new restrictions on energy exploration by U.S.
companies.
   Wright wrote the letter in May 1981, and he also threatened
congressional action against Canadian oil companies operating in
the United States, the newspaper said.
   At the time, Wright's business partnership, Mallightco, owned
250 shares of stock in American Quasar Petroleum, a now-defunct
Fort Worth company that was heavily involved in Canadian oil and
gas activities.
   The Times Herald said that when Wright wrote the letter, he did
not indicate his business partnership had holdings in a company
with an interest in Canadian oil policies.

   A member of the
U.S. Army's elite Golden Knights parachuting team was injured when
he landed on the roof of the Mount Rushmore Visitors Center
following a stunt.
   Sgt. Gary Salmans, 26, had just broken off from a ``tri-plane''
maneuver Saturday morning when the accident occurred, said Staff
Sgt. Dave Hebercorn, a member of the Golden Knights.
   During the stunt three members of the team are stacked, one atop
the other, by holding on to the parachute below with their feet.
When the three broke away prior to landing, Salmans apparently
attempted to avoid people in the Rushmore parking lot and ended up
landing on the building, the Army said.
   Salmans, of Dodge City, Kan., suffered a puncture wound in his
thigh and was taken by helicopter to Ellsworth Air Force Base where
he was listed in stable condition Saturday night before being
transferred to Fitzsimons Army Medical Center in Aurora, Colo. A
spokesman there refused to comment Sunday on Salmans' condition.
   ``It is a very rare occurrence when a jumper is injured,''
Hebercorn said.
   The Golden Knights were using the national memorial in South
Dakota's Black Hills as a backdrop for promotional photographs.

<HEAD>Authorities Try Carrot to Quell Armenian Protests</HEAD>

   Authorities who fear more ethnic strife took a
conciliatory tone with Armenian protesters Sunday, dispersing
several thousand of them with a pledge to allow a rally later this
week, a local journalist said.
   Gen. Maj. Mikhail Surkhov of the local military district
confronted the protesters in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia,
according to an editor with Armenpress, the republic's official
news agency. He persuaded the crowd to break up by assuring them a
legal demonstration could be held on Thursday, the journalist said.
   The editor, who spoke in a telephone interview on condition of
anonymity, said the protesters were demanding freedom for members
of the Karabakh Committee who have been jailed since December. The
group led calls last year for the annexation of Nagorno-Karabakh,
an Armenian-dominated region of neighboring Azerbaijan.
   The dispute between the two southwestern republics led to the
deaths of more than 90 people in ethnic violence last year. The
Kremlin placed the disputed region under its own control.
   A new round of ethnic protests broke out last week.
   Local activist Rafael Popoyan, also speaking by telephone,
reported strikes by students outside the university and other
schools in Yerevan.
   He said Yerevan authorities arrested Movzes Gogkesian, editor of
the magazine Motherland, for an unknown reason.
   Popoyan also said a general strike was continuing in
Nagorno-Karabakh itself to back demands that the mountainous
enclave be put under Armenian control.
   Valeri Sidorov, speaking for the Kremlin-appointed commission
now governing the disputed region, said the strikers' demands had
been forwarded to Moscow.
   However, he said local authorities were less worried about the
strikes than about preventing a new outbreak of ethnic violence.
   ``The situation has to be closely watched'' because the
atmosphere is so tense, he said.
   Several days ago, authorities took a harsher tone, warning they
would use ``all available means'' to prevent more unrest.

   Virginia rivers cleared their banks Sunday, flooding part of
downtown Richmond, in the aftermath of weekend storms that killed
at least 23 people throughout the South.
   Damage estimates from the storms rose into the tens of millions
of dollars, and while some people went to church to give thanks for
survival, others found their churches were barely standing.
   ``I don't know what we'll do. I don't know if there's enough
left to repair,'' J.T. Greene Jr., chairman of the Farmington
Baptist Church board of deacons, said as he looked at the tattered
remains of his church in Davie County, N.C.
   The steeple of the small church, built in 1878, was torn from
the roof during a tornado Friday night and crashed into a vacant
house next door. Part of the roof went with the steeple as it
splintered.
   The twister was part of a strong storm system that swept across
the South on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
   Altogether, seven people were confirmed dead from floods or
storms in Texas, five in Virginia, five in North Carolina, three in
Louisiana, two in South Carolina and one in Oklahoma. More than 100
people were injured.
   In the most recently reported fatality, Virginia state police on
Sunday recovered the body of Barry Joe Rice, 26, who was swept down
the Levisa River in Buchanan County after an accident Friday night.
   Elsewhere in Virginia, the James River rose to 5 feet above
flood stage Sunday afternoon, and several streets on the eastern
edge of downtown Richmond were closed by flooding.
   In the yards of two riverfront cement companies, the tops of
phone booths and overturned garbage containers poked out from
swirling brown water. Officials said they did not expect the water
to reach low-lying areas of the city's business district.
   The Rivianna River in Palmyra crested about 10 feet above flood
levels Saturday, and the Appomattox rose slightly above flood
levels Sunday morning.
   The worst twister damage occurred in the Carolinas on Friday.
   In Durham, N.C., on Sunday, members of Ebenezer Baptist Church
held worship services in a nearby recreation center after the storm
left gaping holes in the roof and walls of their sanctuary.
   ``The destruction has happened _ we can't do anything about
that,'' said the Rev. Henry L. Edmonds. He said the storm struck
just 90 minutes after the church day care program had closed for
the weekend.
   ``I feel they were very fortunate not to have had anything
scheduled there at that time,'' Edmonds said. ``You don't need luck
when you have the Lord.''
   North Carolina Gov. Jim Martin toured Lincoln County, where some
of the most severe damage was reported.
   Martin said he requested federal assistance earlier Sunday, and
that Federal Emergency Management Administration officials in
Washington agreed to send assessment teams to determine what kind
of aid the state is eligible for.
   Tom Ditt of the state Emergency Management Office said damage
across the state exceeded $28 million, while other estimates ranged
far higher.
   About 74,000 Duke Power Co. customers were still without power
Sunday morning as weary workers tried to repair lines that had been
torn to pieces in some places by winds gusting to 100 mph.
   Ditt said teams in 17 North Carolina counties had reported 124
homes destroyed, 171 seriously damaged and 671 that received some
damage. The storms also destroyed 42 businesses and seriously
damaged 11 more, damaged 51 schools and churches and damaged or
destroyed 79 farm buildings across the state.
   In South Carolina, Gov. Carroll Campbell toured the stricken
area in his state by helicopter Saturday and said he expects to ask
for federal disaster relief assistance.
   In hard-hit Spartanburg County, S.C., a spokeswoman for the
county Emergency Preparedness Division estimated damage at about
$1.5 million. The losses include 25 houses and 13 mobile homes,
Debbie Rice said.
   Ms. Rice said the estimate included only damage to buildings,
not crop damage, damage to personal property or cleanup costs.
Those estimates are still being prepared, she said.

   U.S. law enforcers expressed relief
Sunday that four suspected members of a drug-smuggling cult that
killed 15 people were arrested in Mexico, not the United States.
   ``They committed the crimes in Mexico,'' said Oran Neck, chief
U.S. Customs agent in this border city at Texas' southern tip. ``If
they commited murder in Mexico, we can't charge them here.''
   Cult leader Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, and a follower,
Martin Quintana Rodriguez, were killed in Mexico City, authorities
said after a shootout there.
   Sara Maria Aldrete, a former Texas college honor student
described as the ``godmother'' or ``witch'' of the cult, was
arrested at the same Mexico City residence with four others
suspected of belonging to the murderous drug ring.
   Ms. Aldrete, 24, said in Mexico City on Sunday that Constanzo
ordered himself and his right-hand man, Martin Quintana Rodriguez,
killed when police closed in.
   FBI Agent Bob Nixon of Brownsville agreed that it was best that
Ms. Aldrete and the others were arrested in Mexico.
   ``It's great,'' Nixon said. ``It will save us from having to
extradite them'' (to Mexico).
   Constanzo and Ms. Aldrete were among 11 people indicted by a
U.S. federal grand jury in McAllen on drug charges in the case.
   ``The only reason we were looking for them was so we could
extradite them to Mexico so they could be tried there,'' Nixon
said. ``The only purpose of the drug indictments here was to have
probable cause to pick them up and turn them over to Mexico.''
   The task force that handled the case included the FBI, the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration, the Customs Service and the
Cameron County Sheriff's Department.
   Cameron County Sheriff Alex Perez said he did not expect U.S.
officials to try to extradite those in custody in Mexico to the
United States.
   ``I hope they stay over there in Mexico, because that's where
the murders were coordinated and they have to stand trial over
there,'' Perez said.
   Under Mexican law, the worst punishment any of the suspects
could receive is 50 years in prison.
   Mexican officials last month located 15 bodies at or near a
ranch west of the border city of Matamoros, Mexico. The dead,
including a U.S. college student, are believed to be the victims of
a cult that performed human sacrifices and mutilations to bring
magical protection to drug smuggling.
   Five men arrested the week the bodies were exhumed have been
indicted on Mexican federal charges, including first-degree murder,
kidnapping, illegal burial, weapons and drug violations and
cover-up.
   Of the 11 indicted in the United States, two are dead, one was
in U.S. custody and six were in Mexican custody Sunday. Two
remained at large.

<TEXT>
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa on Sunday
told thousands of cheering supporters to take a first step toward a
free Poland by electing union-backed candidates to Parliament next
month.
   After Mass at the Plock cathedral, about 5,000 people walked
down a grassy hill to an open amphitheater overlooking the Vistula
River. There, Walesa introduced the union's five candidates to
represent the region in the Sejm and the Senate.
   Walesa emphasized his roots in the rural central Polish region,
a three-hour drive from his current home in the Baltic port of
Gdansk. He was born in the nearby village of Popowo and told the
crowd he had been baptized in Plock.
   He urged voters to take advantage of new reforms that allow
limited opposition participation in the June 4 legislative
elections for the first time in the history of Communist Poland.
   ``If we stand aside ... someone else will shape this Poland for
us again. So I appeal to you, let's build Poland together,'' he
said.
   ``Our representatives at the Sejm and Senate can create a
platform from which we will jump into freedom and independence. If
we don't do that, our chance to have influenced decisions will be
much smaller,'' Walesa said.
   The Solidarity-led opposition agreed to participate in elections
as part of broad accords reached with authorities April 5. The
agreement resulted in the legalization of the trade union movement
after a seven-year ban.
   It also resulted in the creation of a new legislature, the
Senate, and more-open elections for the existing parliament, the
Sejm.
   Independent candidates can run for 161 seats of the 460-member
Sejm, in which a Communist-led alliance is still guaranteed a
majority. All seats are open to any candidates in the new
100-member Senate, the East bloc's first freely elected legislative
body.
   The two chambers form the National Assembly.
   Stanislaw Stomma, an 81-year-old Warsaw lawyer and Roman
Catholic activist running for the Senate with Solidarity's
endorsement, thanked the crowd for the privilege of running from
their town and said he would spend more time there if he were
elected.
   The law does not require candidates to live in the areas they
seek to represent.
   Walesa's close adviser, Andrzej Celinski, a 39-year-old Warsaw
sociologist and candidate for the Sejm, told the crowd: ``It will
depend on us just how much freedom and justice and Solidarity there
will be in Poland.''
   Three other Solidarity candidates for the Sejm also made short
speeches.
   While union supporters in Plock welcomed Walesa warmly, he drew
some disapproving glances when he drove up to the bishop's
residence in a shiny blue Mercedes.
   ``Don't worry, it's borrowed,'' he said. ``Good thing,'' quipped
a woman in the crowd.
   The opposition rally came during a three-day miners' strike that
has stopped nearly all copper mining in Poland.
   Negotiators resumed talks Sunday in an effort to find a
compromise in the dispute, according to Solidarity Information
Service in Warsaw. It gave no details, however.
   The strike, involving about 20,000 workers, is the country's
first major bout of labor unrest since the opposition and
government reached their accords last month.
   The strike broke out at four mines near the city of Lubin, about
200 miles southwest of Warsaw. The mines represent nearly all of
Poland's copper production, which is an important source of
hard-currency earnings.
   Miners are demanding a 50 percent pay increase, according to Jan
Sugalski, a local Solidarity activist. They now earn $118-176 a
month.

   Airline passengers who survived a
crash-landing in the Yucatan Peninsula kept calm as they waited
overnight for rescuers to cut their way through dense jungle, a
U.S. official said Sunday.
   ``They did everything they could to help each other and to help
themselves,'' said Gennie Valdez, a U.S. consular representative
who was working with crash victims.
   The Aerocozumel flight carrying 18 people, mostly Americans,
crash-landed at about 2:30 p.m. Friday in a remote area about 40
miles south of Cancun. Authorities blamed engine failure for the
crash.
   Six people, all American tourists, were killed and 10 people
were injured. Fifteen of the 16 tourists aboard were U.S. citizens
and one was a Canadian.
   The airline identified the dead as Susan Montgomery, 42, of
Canby, Ore.; Guillermo and Margaret Salisbury; Pryor and Jayne
Hendricks; and Laura Chamberlain. All the dead were U.S. citizens,
and only the hometown and age of Ms. Montgomery were available.
   A Mexican navy helicopter Saturday ferried the last survivor to
a Cancun hospital nearly 24 hours after the accident.
   ``They're in shock,'' said Valdez. ``But I don't have anybody
who is not handling it. It's impressive. It was a serious
emergency.''
   The most badly injured was a man with a broken hip, said Jaime
Valenzuela, a representative for Aerocozumel. Three people were
released on Saturday after undergoing brief observation, Valdez
said.
   Valenzuela said it took two hours for rescue aircraft to spot
the downed Tilatus Trislander, a British-made, triple-engine
aircraft, after a passing commercial jetliner had picked up the
plane's distress signal.
   Scores of rescue workers, assisted by local residents familiar
with the jungle turf, hacked a trail with machetes to the downed
plane Friday afternoon.
   They worked throughout the night and finally reached the plane
at about 8:30 a.m. Saturday.
   Rescuers cleared a site just big enough to allow a navy
helicopter to land. It began ferrying out the dead and wounded at
mid-morning.
   Valdez said she didn't think a faster rescue would have saved
lives.
   ``What I've heard is that most of those who died died
instantly,'' she said.
   The Aerocozumel flight was returning to the resort island of
Cozumel after taking the tourists to view ancient Indian ruins at
Chichen Itza, 115 miles west of Cozumel.
   It crashed about two miles outside the Playa del Carmen airport,
or about 125 miles northeast of Chichen Itza.
   Valenzuela said Capt. Carlos Corso, 34, made the landing after
two of the three engines apparently failed.

<HEAD>Top Environmental Official Blasts Exxon's Efforts In Cleanup</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Leads with six grafs to UPDATE with testimony at congressional
hearing; picks up 3rd graf, `The oil ...'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL JENKINS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VALDEZ, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alaska's top environmental official
testified Sunday that a ``reluctant and myopic'' Exxon stalled
efforts to clean up the nation's largest oil spill by largely
ignoring damage outside the immediate spill zone.
   Dennis Kelso, commissioner of the state Department of
Environmental Conservation, told a congressional panel the spill
has caused ``550 miles of oil, filthy foam and tar balls.''
   He said that on the East Coast, it would be the equivalent of
oil washing up on beaches from Boston south to the mouth of
Chesapeake Bay and possibly to the Potomac River.
   ``The industry's response was reluctant and myopic, chacterized
by stalling techniques, disinformation, and a refusal to pay real
attention to damage outside of Prince William Sound,'' Kelso told
the five-member subcommittee of the House Interior Committee.
   The congressional panel planned two days of hearings in Valdez,
with testimony scheduled from state, federal and Exxon officials.
   In another development Sunday, a state official said Exxon's
decision to pull cleanup crews from an oil-stained beach caught
authorities by surprise, but a spokesman for the oil company
defended the decision.
   The oil company removed its workers Saturday from a
pebble-strewn beach on the north edge of Smith Island, a site
described only shortly before by the ranking federal official in
charge of the cleanup as ``far from clean.'' The site was one of
those visited last week by Vice President Dan Quayle during his
stopover in the state.
   Crews remained on the island, but at another oil-fouled landfall
nearby, Exxon said. The island is considered crucial to the annual
seal pupping cycle.
   ``The people who were here last night from Exxon didn't know
anything about this,'' Pete McGee, a scientist with the state
Department of Environmental Conservation, said Sunday. Exxon and
state and federal officials have been conducting nightly meetings
on the progress of the cleanup.
   McGee said state and federal officials were surprised that the
beach cleanup was halted because ``the beach was not adequately
clean.''
   Exxon spokesman Pete Stilling said the cleanup crews were moved
off the northern beach in order to attack more heavily soiled areas
nearby.
   ``I think we fully intend to come back to that beach. I won't
tell you we'll be back on that beach tomorrow,'' Stilling said.
``(Exxon's) best judgment at this point is that it's time to move
on.''
   Al Ewing, an assistant regional administrator of the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, said he was on the north beach
Saturday morning and found it still ``very difficult to walk on''
because of the oil.
   Exxon faces a Wednesday deadline to have the worst of the oil
cleansed from several islands in Prince William Sound, and has
promised to clean some 364 miles of coastline by Sept. 15.
   The tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in the sound on
March 24 after filling its storage tanks with crude from the
trans-Alaska pipeline. More than 10 million gallons of oil poured
into the sound.

   Eight carnival-goers trapped in a broken ``super
loop'' ride were rescued Sunday after being left dangling upside
down and 60 feet in the air for more than two hours.
   ``Apparently, a light fixture had shaken loose and had come down
on the tracks and jammed. When the little train came by it was
stopped,'' said Fire Department spokesman John Mulligan.
   The ride in Queens, which was part of a traveling carnival and
consists of connecting train cars that run on a hoop-shaped track,
ground to a halt late Saturday at the top of the loop, leaving the
eight thrill-seekers screaming for help.
   After a while, the trapped riders, tiring of being upside down,
unbuckled their seat belts and sat on the safety cage surrounding
the seats. Rescue workers feared it might not hold their weight,
Mulligan said.
   Around 12:15 a.m., after about 2{ hours, firefighters using a
cherry picker were able to take the passengers off the crippled
ride two at a time, he said.
   No one was seriously injured, but two riders were taken to
Peninsula General Hospital for treatment for exposure, Mulligan
said.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some foreign observers of Panama's
presidential election said Sunday they saw no evidence of voting
irregularities despite opposition predictions of fraud, but others
were less flattering.
   ``They (the government) tried to put on a nice play, but it
wasn't Shakespeare,'' said Jurgen Koch, a West German observer
invited by Panama's human rights commission.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, invited by the Panamanian
government, appeared satisfied with the voting process. ``The only
problem I've seen is with the number of voters,'' he said,
referring to the long lines of voters as he visited polls at the
Torrijos-Carter Elementary School in the sprawling, dusty,
working-class suburb of San Miguelito.
   He said there had been complaints in some precincts about
ballots arriving late, but ``I've checked with the opposition and
the government representatives at the polls ... and they don't seem
to have any problems at the places where I've been.''
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., part of an univited 13-member
delegation sent by President Bush, said his group had seen
irregularities.
   ``The general belief is that the election will be stolen
sometime tonight,'' McCain said as polls closed at 5 p.m.
   ``We've seen many irregularities but it is difficult to judge
the extent of the irregularities,'' he said.
   The Bush delegation arrived Saturday, apparently traveling under
temporary duty orders from the U.S. Department of Defense.
   The Panamanian government had said the delegation was not
welcome and would not be issued visas. But election officials
allowed the group to visit polling places.
   Koch echoed complaints by pollwatchers from the opposition
Christian Democratic Party that hundreds of voters had been
instructed to go to certain voting stations in precincts known to
favor the opposition, only to get there and be told they were not
registered.
   Panama ``tolerated observers but did not let them get to close
to the action,'' Koch said.
   Carter was greeted in San Miguelito by cheering crowds of voters
who yelled, ``Viva Jimmy!'' and ``We love you very much Jimmy
Carter.''
   The elementary school is named after the 1977 treaties under
which the United States is to hand over the Panama Canal to Panama
at the end of the century. Carter and Omar Torrijos, the late
Panamanian dictator, signed the treaties.
   Carter headed an observer delegation that included former
President Gerald Ford. He visited more than a half dozen voting
places around Panama City.
   Bush delegation leader Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., said he saw no
signs of irregularities but guards had threatened to remove a Costa
Rican observer from polls at one precinct near the capital for
allegedly being too close.
   Murtha said the attempt was shouted down by opposition voters.
   ``People feel very strongly about this election. It is going to
be difficult to have a fraudulent election and overcome what the
polls indicate,'' he said.
   Published polls gave opposition candidate Guillermo Endara a
2-to-1 edge over pro-government candidate Carlos Duque.
   The opposition, while welcoming the observers, predicted the
election would be rigged.
   It said the government issued duplicate voting cards to some
Panamanians, allowing them to vote more than once, and planned a
fraudulent computer vote count.
   Luis Felipe Romero, a Mexican observer invited, like Koch, by
the Panamanian Human Rights Commission, said ``It's all quiet so
far.''
   He and other observers were told by the rights commission to
stay 100 feet or so from the nearest booth to avoid the appearance
of interference.
   Manuel Burgos, an opposition spokesman, claimed that five Costa
Rican observers were detained Saturday night in Chitre province,
interrogated and had their luggage searched. They were released
Sunday morning, he said.

   The Coast Guard was waiting for better
weather Sunday before attempting to rescue 41 people stranded on a
Bering Sea island after their skiff capsized in rough seas.
   Crew members from the crab-processing ship Coastal Star were
stranded on St. Matthew Island after leaving their ship for a
beachcombing trip Friday, Coast Guard spokesman Fritz Richter said.
   The ship, the 320-foot Coastal Star, is anchored an undetermined
distance off St. Matthew Island, which is about 425 miles north of
the Aleutian Islands.
   The 66 crew members stil aboard the ship floated survival suits,
food and radios to the island to held their stranded colleagues
survive their first night.
   On Saturday, a C-130 aircraft dispatched from the Coast Guard
base at Kodiak dropped tents, food, warm clothing, sleeping bags
and fuel to the island, where it was snowing, Richter said.
   ``They are safe for the time being and I think relatively
comfortable,'' he said Sunday. ``They were able to build a fire.''
   As they waited for calmer weather, the Coast Guard cutter
Jarvis' crew patrolled the island's north coast, looking for a
stretch of beach on which to land a flat-bottomed rescue vessel.
   Winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet had prevented vessels
from providing help on Friday and Saturday.
   Richter said he assumed the skiff had been ferrying small groups
of crew members to the island when the craft capsized, tossing an
undetermined number of people into the icy water. But he said the
passengers were close enough to swim to shore, and there were no
reports of injuries or hypothermia.
   The crew members are workers aboard the fish processor.
   ``I have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like
this,'' Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson said in Juneau.
   The Coastal Star, which can carry 120 people, is based in
Petersburg, Alaska, and owned by Icicle Seafoods of Seattle. No one
answered the telephone at Icicle Seafoods on Sunday.

<HEAD>Gas Prices Jump Nearly Two Cents Per Gallon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gasoline prices jumped nearly two cents a
gallon in the past two weeks as wholesalers passed on rising costs
and took advantage of rising demand, an industry analyst said
Sunday.
   The national average retail price for all grades of gasoline,
including taxes, was 117.38 cents per gallon May 5, Trilby Lundberg
said.
   That figure was up 1.95 cents per gallon over the price reported
in the April 21 survey of 12,000 stations nationwide.
   Average prices at self-serve stations, which comprise most
sales, were 106.60 cents per gallon for regular leaded, 108.13 for
regular unleaded and 123.19 for premium unleaded.
   Full-serve prices were 130.08 for regular leaded, 132.39 for
regular unleaded and 143.96 for premium unleaded.
   The jump was far smaller than the approximate 10 cents per
gallon hike last month after the Valdez oil spill temporarily
cinched oil supplies, but consumers who expected a price break were
disappointed, Ms. Lundberg said.
   ``A great deal of the prices we've seen in recent weeks has been
directly related to the rising price of crude oil,'' which has
risen by several dollars a gallon, she said.
   Prices also were affected by increased demand and by changes in
gasoline composition mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency to make gas less volatile during hot summer months, Ms.
Lundberg said.
   Prices could ``rise even faster and go significantly higher'' as
summer demand goes up, Ms. Lundberg said.
   But she said that was by no means certain because the seasonal
demand, which peaks in July or August, is mitigated by increased
competition.

   One of space shuttle Atlantis' main
computers quit Sunday, and although it came back on line, ground
controllers had the astronauts install a spare for Monday's
critical re-entry and landing.
   The flight crew dropped all other jobs to concentrate on the
4{-hour job of installing the spare.
   When the astronauts finished, Mission Control communicator Tammy
Jernigan radioed, ``We send our congratulations. Good work. This is
the first time such a changeout has ever taken place in orbit.''
   The extra work forced the crew members to delay their sleep
period by an hour.
   Atlantis has four operating computers, one backup and one spare.
They control and monitor all spacecraft systems, and actually fly
the shuttle most of the time. Atlantis could land Monday with only
one computer operating, if necessary.
   Flight director Ron Dittemore said the loss of the computer
posed no threat to the mission.
   ``We just don't have the confidence to run with it for entry,''
he told reporters.
   Shuttle commander David Walker told Mission Control, ``It looks
like GPC-4 has failed.'' He was directed to switch on General
Purpose Computer No. 3, the spare.
   Walker then restored No. 4 to operation. ``It seems to be
working,'' he reported.
   After ground experts determined there was a hardware problem,
they decided to take no chances with the unit and ordered the spare
installed in No. 4's place.
   ``We'll terminate all the experiments and get at it,'' Walker
said. Dropped were one sample run in a materials processing furnace
and photographs being taken of lightning and polluted areas on
Earth.
   Dittemore said computer No. 4's reactivation indicated the
failure was temporary.
   ``There might be something floating in there that caused a
short,'' he said. ``We just know we don't want to trust it.''
   ``The failure had no impact on the the flight,'' said Mission
Control commentator Billie Deeson. ``The vehicle continues to
perform normally.''
   Walker and pilot Ronald Grabe checked shuttle systems Sunday,
making sure they were ready for the hourlong plunge from 184 miles
up through the atmosphere Monday. Landing is scheduled for 12:43
p.m. PDT at Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert.
   CBS, NBC, and Cable News Network plan to provide live coverage
Monday of the landing of the space shuttle Atlantis. ABC's coverage
plans were incomplete Sunday.
   Earlier, Walker had reported Atlantis was performing flawlessly
and that the Magellan spacecraft, a robot probe the crew launched
on a flight to Venus, was operating without a hitch.
   If Atlantis' flight continues as well as it has, ``I'd sure give
it a 10 on my personal scale,'' Walker said. ``You couldn't ask for
a better flying machine.''
   The shuttle commander was answering questions beamed up from
reporters at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
   Walker remarked that the Magellan launch was significant because
it shows ``the human race is continuing its exploration of the
solar system.''
   Magellan was more than a half-million miles from Earth on Sunday
on its 15-month journey to cloud-shrouded Venus, and project
scientists said all its systems were working well. Venus was more
than 158 million miles away.
   When Magellan reaches Venus in August 1990, it is to fire into
orbit about the planet and map up to 90 percent of the surface with
a high resolution radar system.
   Astronaut Norman Thagard told reporters that the images obtained
by the $550 million Magellan project should tell scientists not
only about the history of Venus but also about the evolution of its
sister planet, Earth.
   He noted that Venus, shrouded in sulfuric acid clouds and a
carbon dioxide atmosphere, has a runaway greenhouse effect that has
resulted in surface temperatures of 900 degrees Fahrenheit.
   Many scientists fear that Earth is warming up and may experience
a severe greenhouse effect itself sometime in the future. To help
prevent that happening, Thagard said, ``we need to know the
mechanisms whereby these things occur.''
   The Edwards forecast called for favorable weather, with high
scattered clouds and visibility of seven miles.
   NASA expected a relatively small crowd of 100,000 on hand for
the landing. Spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said Atlantis wasn't expected
to draw as many people as some past shuttle flights because it is
landing on a weekday. An estimated 460,000 people watched Discovery
touch down March 18, a Saturday.
   Mission specialists Mary Cleave, Mark Lee and Thagard began
packing up and stowing equipment and experiments as the four-day
orbital journey neared an end.
   The workload was limited because the Magellan probe and its
rocket booster, which together weighed 45,000 pounds, did not allow
for many experiments to be carried aboard.
   Cleave said the light workload enabled her to concentrate more
time on a materials processing furnace where she melted and
resolidified small samples of a metal called indium to see how the
process works in weightlessness.
   ``It's been working perfectly and we hope to bring back some
good indium crystals,'' she said.
   Potential applications for such space-made materials include
advanced electronic and optical devices devoid of the contamination
that occurs naturally during processing in Earth's gravity.
   Most of the other experiments involved photography of polluted
areas on Earth and of lightning strikes in the atmosphere.

<HEAD>Cardinal O'Connor Visits With Central Park Rape Suspects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cardinal John J. O'Connor said Sunday he is
counseling the teen-age suspects in the gang rape of a Central Park
jogger to ease their suffering and has visited the victim and her
family several times.
   ``It was clear that she and her family were suffering so much,''
O'Connor said of the victim and her parents.
   But the Roman Catholic leader said he felt compelled to also
reach out to the suspects' families.
   ``I realized that the families of those boys would be suffering
and I would make myself available to do anything that I could do to
help them,'' O'Connor said outside St. Patrick's Cathedral.
   O'Connor said he wrote the parents of the six youths accused in
the April 19 attack and ``told them that I was available to assist
in any way that I could without entering into the judicial
process.''
   O'Connor said he subsequently met with five of the boys at
Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx and with the sixth suspect at
the Rikers Island jail. It was not clear when the visits took place.
   O'Connor said he ``walked away with a great sense of sadness''
after his visit with the boys and described the park attack as a
``complex nightmare.''
   ``Those kids, their lives will have to be changed whatever
happens to them by way of the judicial process and the families,
they must be traumatized,'' he said.
   The victim, a28-year-old Wall Street investment banker, was
attacked while jogging after dark along her usual route in Central
Park. She was beaten, raped and left for dead in a mud puddle, and
spent two weeks in a coma, police said.
   She emerged from a coma last week, and was in critical and
stable condition on Sunday, hospital officials said.
   O'Connor said he deliberately avoided talking about the attack
with the suspects and spoke in general terms to the boys.
   ``I talked the kind of thing that one talks with lads who are
confined under those circumstances,'' O'Connor said. ``Where are
you in school? Where are you in the family? How many kids in your
family?''
   He said the boys were glad to see him and asked him to return.
O'Connor said he planned to meet with some of the boys' parents
sometime this week.

<TEXT>
   Panamanians voted for a new president
Sunday in an election fraught with charges of fraud and U.S.
interference, and some foreign observers complained of voting
irregularities.
   The election, seen as a referendum on the de facto rule of Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, pitted Carlos Duque, hand-picked by
Noriega, against Guillermo Endara, the candidate of an opposition
coalition.
   ``The triumph of the opposition is indisputable,'' Endara said
after polls closed at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EDT) but before any results
had been announced. He called for a march Monday to safeguard the
results.
   Although Endara cited no figures, the opposition released an
exit poll claiming that 55.1 percent of 1,022 voters said they had
chosen Endara and 39.5 percent said they had voted for Duque.
   In the only reported incident of violence, the Roman Catholic
church said a Dutch priest was shot and seriously wounded by
soldiers as he urged people over a loudspeaker to go to the polls
in the western city of David.
   Voters began lining up at some polling stations at 5 a.m., two
hours before the scheduled opening. At one booth, more than 100 of
348 registered voters were in line by 8 a.m. By late afternoon, the
lines were gone.
   The government promised official results within 24 hours after
closing time.
   The opposition accused the government of making arrangements for
its supporters to vote ``early and often'' and said they feared the
election would be stolen as votes were tallied at the Election
Tribunal.
   Opposition leaders pointed out that the 15,000 members of
Noriega's Defense Forces were allowed to jump to the front of
voting lines and they could vote at any booth, making multiple
voting possible.
   They said hundreds of opposition supporters who went to the San
Juan Bautista de la Salle College to vote were told they were not
registered to do so. The college is in a wealthy Panama City
district.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., part of a 13-member uninvited
delegation sent by President Bush, said: ``The general belief is
that the election will be stolen sometime tonight.''
   ``We've seen many irregularities, but it is difficult to judge
the extent of the irregularities,'' he said.
   ``They tried to put on a nice play, but it wasn't Shakespeare,''
said Jurgen Koch, a West German observer invited by Panama's human
rights commission.
   Former President Jimmy Carter, however, said he had seen no
irregularities. ``The only problem I've seen is with the number of
voters,'' he said, referring to the long lines of voters.
   He said there had been complaints in some precincts about
ballots arriving late, but ``I've checked with the opposition and
the government representatives at the polls ... and they don't seem
to have any problems at the places where I've been.''
   Carter was invited by the Panamanian government along with
former President Gerald Ford.
   Daniel Nunez, the Roman Catholic bishop of David, said that Rev.
Nicolas Van Cleef was arrested inside a car by the Defense Forces
while urging a high voter turnout and criticizing fraud over a car
loudspeaker.
   Van Cleef was shot while inside the car and was listed in
``grave'' condition, the church said. Telephone calls to government
spokesmen for comment were not returned.
   The government contends the opposition has joined forces with
the United States in an effort to abrogate the 1977 Panama Canal
treaties, which call for the United States to give the canal to
Panama on Dec. 31, 1999.
   As proof, Duque pointed to damaging U.S. economic sanctions,
U.S. drug charges against Noriega, and reports that the United
States provided the opposition with $10 million in campaign
assistance.
   The opposition denies the government charges, and says Noriega
must be eased out as commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces if
democracy is to progress in Panama.
   Duque and acting president Manuel Solis Palma received a mixture
of boos and cheers when they voted.
   Endara, 52, and Duque, 59, are both businessmen. A new president
takes office Sept. 1.
   A pro-government newspaper, La Republica, published official
Election Tribunal figures showing pro-government parties with
611,000 registered members out of 1.18 million registered voters.
   Opposition vice-presidential candidate Ricardo Arias Calderon
issued a statement saying he had ``not the slightest doubt that
there will be fraud.'' He was one of the leaders calling for a
protest march Monday.
   Arias Calderon repeated accusations that the electoral register
included 100,000 duplicate names and that out of a sampling of
3,000 recent deaths, the names of 27 percent of the dead were still
on the register.
   Several voters told reporters they had checked to make sure dead
or absent relatives were stricken from the voting list.
   ``That's two less votes they can steal,'' said Lilia Shaw after
making sure officials crossed off the names of her brother and
father, both out of the country.
   Noriega's hold over the Defense Forces has given him effective
control of the government since 1983, and he has been able to
remove presidents at will.
   In the last election, in 1984, Nicolas Ardito Barletta was
narrowly elected over Arnulfo Arias Madrid amid cries of fraud.
Noriega had Barletta resign and installed Eric Delvalle as
president in 1985.
   When Delvalle tried to fire Noriega in February 1988 after the
general was indicted in the United States on drug charges, Noriega
engineered Delvalle's ouster and installed Solis Palma as acting
president.
   Noriega denies the drug charges.

   Gunfire erupted Sunday at a crowded
Wal-Mart store, killing a gunman who was described as mentally
disturbed and wounding a policeman, officials said.
   The man exchanged gunfire with two police officers inside the
store filled with shoppers shortly after 2 p.m., said police Lt.
Mike McKenna.
   The man, identified as Aaron Coleman, 21, of Wichita, died about
two hours later at a Wichita hospital, said police Capt. John
Hershberger.
   One of the officers suffered a gunshot wound to the leg. The
officer, who was in good condition at a hospital, was not
identified.
   Police went to the store after receiving reports that someone
was armed and threatening to harm himself or others, McKenna said.
Employees described the man as mentally disturbed, he said.
   The man had pulled a gun, and pulled it again in front of
police, Hershberger said.
   Police did not know if both officers and the suspect fired their
weapons or how many shots were fired, Hershberger said.
   When the shooting started, Wal-Mart employees screamed at
customers to get down on the floor, witnesses said.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard on Sunday rescued 41
sailors stranded on a Bering Sea island for two days after their
skiff capsized in rough seas, officials said.
   Crew from the Coast Guard cutter Jarvis used a raft and a small
boat to shuttle the sailors from St. Matthew Island to their crab
processing ship after harsh weather subsided, Coast Guard Lt. Jeff
Merrell.
   All of those rescued were in good condition, Merrell said.
   The crab processing ship, the 320-foot Coastal Star, was
anchored off the island about 425 miles north of the Aleutian
Islands.
   The sailors were stranded on the island Friday after leaving the
ship for a beachcombing trip, Coast Guard spokesman Fritz Richter
said.
   The 66 crew members still aboard the ship floated survival
suits, food and radios to the island to held their stranded
colleagues survive their first night.
   On Saturday, a C-130 aircraft dispatched from the Coast Guard
base at Kodiak dropped tents, food, warm clothing, sleeping bags
and fuel to the island, where it was snowing, Richter said.
   Winds of 45 knots and seas up to 15 feet prevented vessels from
providing help on Friday and Saturday.
   Richter said he assumed the skiff had been ferrying small groups
of crew members to the island when the craft capsized, tossing an
undetermined number of people into the icy water. But he said the
passengers were close enough to swim to shore, and there were no
reports of injuries or hypothermia.
   The crew members are workers aboard the fish processor.
   ``I have no idea why they would be beachcombing in weather like
this,'' Coast Guard spokesman Greg Robinson said in Juneau.
   The Coastal Star, which can carry 120 people, is based in
Petersburg, Alaska, and owned by Icicle Seafoods of Seattle. No one
answered the telephone at Icicle Seafoods on Sunday.

   An out-of-season snowstorm left more than 10 inches of snow on
the ground in western New York state on Sunday, and powerful
thunderstorms caused flash flooding in Texas.
   Low-temperature records were set in more than a dozen cities
from Alabama to Illinois.
   In Rochester, N.Y., 10.1 inches of snow piled up by late Sunday,
shattering that city's record for snowfall by more than 6{ inches.
   Seven inches of snow fell in Batavia and Warsaw, N.Y., and snow
broke tree limbs and downed power lines throughout the western
Finger Lakes.
   The unusual weather was caused by low pressure centered over
extreme south-central Quebec that drew moist, cold air south across
the Ohio Valley and Appalachian Mountains. Snow fell over parts of
New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.
   By early afternoon, temperatures had risen above freezing over
most of the area and the snow was either mixed with rain or changed
to rain.
   Severe thunderstorms raked parts of north-central Texas with
heavy rains and golf ball-size hail. Graham, Texas, was especially
hard hit. The slow movement of the storms caused some flash
flooding over parts of Young, Jack and Palo Pinto counties.
   Elsewhere, scattered showers lingered from northeast North
Carolina to Maryland and Delaware, and rain and snow were mixed
across northern sections of lower Michigan.
   Pueblo, Colo., recorded a record high temperature for the date
of 79 degrees. But most of the records set Sunday were for low
temperatures.
   Among the record lows were 29 degrees in Champaign, Ill.; 29 in
Chicago; 34 in Fayetteville, Ark.; 38 in Fort Smith, Ark.; 28 in
Fort Wayne, Ind.; 37 in Greer, S.C.; 41 in Huntsville, Ala.; 34 in
Kansas City, Mo.; 29 in Lincoln, Neb.; 36 in Louisville, Ky.; 24 in
Madison, Wis.; 42 in Meridian, Miss.; 35 in Paducah, Ky.; 30 in St.
Joseph, Mo.; 28 in South Bend, Ind.; and 31 in Springfield, Mo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 33
degrees at Johnstown, Pa., to 101 degrees at both Needles, Calif.,
and Yuma, Ariz.
   The nation's low Sunday morning was 22 degrees at Beloit, Wis.
   The forecast for Monday called for showers across New England,
New York state and northern Pennsylvania, with snow showers
possible at higher elevations; scattered showers and thunderstorms
from Oklahoma to the northern Plains and the upper Mississippi
Valley; widely scattered thunderstorms in much of Texas and the
mountains of Wyoming and Colorado; and mostly sunny skies around
the rest of the nation.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 50s and 60s from the
northern Plains to the Great Lakes, New England and the Carolinas;
the 90s and above from the central valleys and southern deserts of
California to central and southern Texas; and in the 70s and 80s
elsewhere.

<HEAD>Congressmen Criticize Boeing Sale to South African Airways</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co. says it will sell up to $502 million
worth of 747 jumbo jets to South Africa in a deal which drew strong
criticism from members of the state's congressional delegation.
   The aircraft maker based here and South African Transport
Minister Eli Louw in Johannesburg said in separate announcements
Saturday South African Airways would buy two Boeing 747-400 jets
for $256 million. The planes are to be delivered in November 1990
and May 1991.
   The government-owned airline also has options for two more
aircraft, which would be delivered in 1992 for another $256 million.
   Sen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., is ``violently opposed to the sale,''
said spokeswoman Barbara Smith. ``He finds it very inappropriate.''
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said in Spokane he
thinks Boeing officials know there are strong feelings in the
United States and Seattle about South Africa's system of apartheid,
or racial segregation.
   Foley said he had a ``forthright talk'' with Boeing Commercial
Airplanes President Dean Thornton, who told him that ``Boeing has a
longstanding policy to sell its planes without regard to foreign
policy as long as the sale is legal.''
   U.S. policies do not prohibit such sales to South Africa. Boeing
shareholders recently voted down a stockholder-proposed measure
that would have prohibited doing business with South Africa.
   Boeing has no office, employees or investments in South Africa,
said Boeing Commercial Airplanes spokesman Dick Schleh.
   ``The Boeing Company markets to airlines throughout the world so
long as they're countries the U.S. government permits sales to be
made in,'' Schleh said. ``When it comes to the question of whether
aircraft should be sold in a particular country, it's a decision
best made by the U.S. government.''
   Rep. Jim McDermott, a Democrat whose district includes Boeing,
opposes the sale and is a sponsor of a resolution to increase trade
sanctions against South Africa.
   Mike Williams, McDermott's staff director, said Friday that
Boeing told McDermott earlier in the week that a sale was being
negotiated.
   ``I've come back to Seattle to try to meet with them and see
what's going on and why,'' Williams said. ``Representative
McDermott has expressed in no uncertain terms that he is opposed to
the sale.''
   ``At this point there is no specific violation of the 1986
Anti-apartheid Act because it appears to be a commercial sale,''
said Ms. Smith, Sen. Adams' spokeswoman. ``But that does not excuse
the Boeing Company from taking an insensitive position.''
   The Anti-apartheid Act prohibits the sale of some technology to
South Africa that could be used by the government or military.
   ``This is considered a commercial transaction,'' Schleh said.
   Boeing has sold 53 airliners to South African Airways. The last
one was delivered in 1983.

<HEAD>States Advertising In Each Other to Draw Business</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alabama's billboard confronts one of Michigan's
greatest concentrations of influential businesses, catching the eye
like a red flag on the I-94 ``automation alley'' thoroughfare
linking Detroit and Ann Arbor.
   ``Detroit, Start Your Engines. Alabama Is Open For Business,''
it reads.
   The Alabama Development Office, Alabama corporations and
communities help pay for billboards such as that one in cities
ranging from St. Louis to New York, spokesman Robert Sutton said.
   Visits from Alabama emissaries follow in search of more
industries like Huntsville's high technology and computer
companies, Birmingham's medical research facilities and forest
products enterprises statewide, Sutton said.
   Michigan officials try to lure companies and travelers by
advertising in other states too, but they aren't heading for
Alabama _ with banjos, billboards or any other direct counterattack.
   ``We don't do billboards. We've never felt it would necessarily
do the job for us,'' said Al Sandner of the tourist-seeking state
Travel Bureau.
   There will also be no `Bama billboard battle by the state
Manufacturing Development Group, which goes after new offices and
plants, marketing unit director Jeff Mason said.
   ``As opposed to going into a number of different states, we have
targeted particular industries,'' Mason said. ``Then we have
searched out the most rapidly growing industries in those
categories.''
   Mason's department spends $3 million a year on advertising to
lure business to Michigan. Sandner's agency spends $4.5 million to
draw tourists.
   Battling back, neighoring Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and
Ontario Province in Canada are familiar advertisers for tourists in
Michigan, as well as southerly destinations like Kentucky,
Tennessee, Florida and Texas.
   Michigan spends its tourist ad money on television, magazine,
newspaper supplement and radio ads in many of those same states,
Sandner said. It attracts most of its tourists from the Chicago
area.
   When summer simmers, Alabama, as well as Florida, Georgia,
Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, are ideal targets for magazine
spreads showing rippling waters and golf greens that stay green.
   ``We'll use a four-color photo of some spectacular Great Lakes
scene _ water scenes _ and hint that the water goes on forever. The
subliminal message being when July and August get to be too much in
Central Florida, come on up to our peninsulas and cool off,'' he
said.
   When Michigan wants to bag businesses, it doesn't aim at
neighbors, Mason said.
   ``Our posture has been not to go robbing Peter to pay Paul.
Ultimately you end up redistributing the number of businesses
between the two states and really not increasing the amount of
business activity.
   ``You're just capturing one for the one that left,'' he said.
``We're looking to expand the ones that are here and capture the
ones looking at new locations.''

<HEAD>Family Seeks Restructuring of Stock-Holding Method</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of the man who founded the
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. discount chain wants to restructure the way
they hold company stock, which could result in substantial tax
benefits, according to the company's proxy report.
   The Walton family members now hold 218 million Wal-Mart shares,
worth about $7.7 billion, as owners of a Delaware corporation
called Walton Enterprises that actually holds the stock. The
individual Waltons _ company founder Sam Walton and his four
children, S. Robson, John T., Jim C. and Alice L. _ own roughly
equal shares of Walton Enterprises.
   The recently released Wal-Mart proxy report says the family has
proposed to hold ownership of the Wal-Mart shares through a
partnership instead of a corporation. The report said family
members ``may obtain very substantial future tax advantages'' by
changing their holding method to a partnership.
   To do that, the Waltons have proposed an exchange of stock with
Wal-Mart Stores, provided that there is a tax ruling that the
exchange itself would not be taxed. The Wal-Mart board has named a
committee of its independent directors to review the proposed
exchange and negotiate its terms.
   Little Rock tax lawyer George Plastiras said tax laws would
apply differently to Wal-Mart stock held in a partnership instead
of through a corporation if there later is a distribution of the
stock to individual partners, upon dissolution of the partnership,
or to Walton Enterprises stockholders if it were dissolved as a
corporation.
   ``They can dissolve the partnership in a non-taxable event,''
Plastiras said.
   Woody Whyte, an analyst for the Little Rock investment banking
firm Staephens Inc., said the proposal ``has nothing to do with the
(Wal-Mart) company'' as such. The Walton-controlled stock still
would be controlled by the Waltons, he said.

liquidation of their company or a housecleaning by a new owner, but
a group of Eastern employees is keeping up a skeleton operation at
the strikebound carrier.
   ``It's a risk, but I happen to believe in what we're doing, so
it's a risk you take,'' said Bob Tripp, explaining why he has
stayed with Eastern despite its uncertain future.
   Tripp was mopping floors Friday as the strike by Eastern's
machinists, pilots and flight attendants entered its third month.
The 23-year Eastern employee wearing the grimed workclothes is
normally manager of internal distribution.
   ``This is Management Development 101,'' he said. ``I'm doing all
the things I usually supervise from my white-collar job.''
   With 4,500 employees, down from nearly 30,000 before the strike,
Eastern workers are averaging 10 to 12 hours a day without extra
compensation and most have several sets of duties. The carrier is
flying about 10 percent of its pre-strike schedule.
   Texas Air Corp., which owns Eastern, is hoping a U.S. Bankruptcy
Court judge will approve a plan that provides for the sale of $1.8
billion in assets, leaving a smaller, reorganized carrier staffed
by nonunion workers.
   Eastern's unions say the carrier, which filed for reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code after the strike
began, should be sold to one of several prospective buyers who have
until May 10 to submit bids.
   Some independent analysts have said Eastern should be liquidated.
   But the remaining Eastern workers want to see their company pull
through.
   ``Chapter 11 _ It's the First Chapter of the Rest of Your Life''
proclaim posters throughout the carrier's headquarters and its
shops at Miami International Airport.
   ``Eastern Will Survive,'' other signs promise.
   Smaller, handwritten signs taped to bathroom doors remind
employees that there are no paid cleaners anymore, so each employee
must help keep things clean.
   Few people are doing only their normal, prestrike jobs.
   Bob Wolf, the domestic advertising manager, was in overalls
Friday, working in the wheels and brakes department. He also helps
pack the liquor kits for flights.
   Nearby, two computer programmers were repairing plane tires.
   Cira Tellechea, an area sales manager, was welding an aluminum
patch onto a plane part.
   On Friday, Eastern averaged 71 passengers on its 110 or so daily
flights _ less than one-third capacity for many of its planes.
   But the airline's remaining workers point to stellar on-time
rates of 96.5 percent and reduced complaints about lost bags and
other passenger problems.
   ``It's a piece of cake, no sweat at all,'' said Leo Ouellette, a
supervisor at Systems Control, where dispatchers monitor the
locations of all of Eastern's planes and crews. ``With 110 flights
a day when we're used to 1,000 or more, things are very efficient.''
   Eastern is getting ready to add more flights, with 264 new
pilots in training and interviews scheduled with 270 more this
week. The company took out newspapers ads Sunday to hire new
mechanics, and the first new flight attendants began training last
week and schools for 56 each in Miami and Atlanta will probably
begin this week.

<HEAD>British Investors Lead In Foreign Stock Buying</HEAD>

   American investors added $1.5 billion to their
holdings of foreign stocks last year, reversing the net sales of
1987, the Securities Industry Association said in a report released
Sunday.
   In 1987, the year of the crash, Americans had sold $1.1 billion
more of foreign stocks than they bought, the association said.
   Meanwhile, foreigners sold more U.S. stocks than they bought
last year by a margin of $2.1 billion, compared to net purchases of
$16.3 billion in 1987.
   But in spite of the stock sales, foreigners added to their
holdings of U.S. securities overall, including bonds, the report
said.
   Foreign investment in all kinds of U.S. securities rose to $75
billion last year from $69.4 billion in 1987, according to the
association.
   The British were the leaders in net purchases of foreign stocks
last year, buying $5.5 billion more than they sold, the association
said.
   The survey covered investors in Britain, the United States, West
Germany, Japan and Canada.

   Civilian unemployment, rising at the fastest
clip in more than three years, jumped to 5.3 percent last month,
the government said in a report that was taken as the strongest
evidence yet of an economic slowdown.
   Propelling the 0.3 percentage point gain in the jobless rate was
the smallest rise in new jobs since June 1986, the Labor Department
said Friday.

   Americans took out $5.37 billion more in
consumer debt than they paid off in March, roughly matching
February's rate of growth despite a big dropoff in borrowing for
cars, the government says.
   The Federal Reserve Board said Friday consumer credit increased
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 9.4 percent in March, off
slightly from the revised 9.5 percent pace of advance in February.
For all of 1988, consumer credit increased 8.5 percent.

   The Machinists union at Northwest Airlines
has told the carrier's parent it plans to mount its own bid to buy
the airline holding company, union sources say.
   The International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143,
Northwest's largest union, made the proposal in a letter to the
board of directors of NWA Inc., Northwest's parent, the sources
told The Associated Press on Friday.
   NWA is the target of a number of takeover bids, including a $2.7
billion, or $90-a-share, hostile offer from billionaire oilman
Marvin Davis.

   Takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn has signaled
his interest in buying strikebound Eastern Airlines' Philadelphia
airport hub, an Icahn associate says.
   Icahn filed documents with the federal bankruptcy court Friday
expressing his interest in the hub without specifying the price
he'd be willing to pay, Trans World Airlines General Counsel Mark
Buckstein told The Associated Press. Icahn, who publicly expressed
interest in all of Eastern some time ago but hasn't formally
bidded, is the owner and chairman of TWA.
   On Sunday, Eastern advertised in major newspapers across the
country for pilots to replace the striking members of the Air Line
Pilots Association.

   Boeing Co. says it will sell up to $502 million
worth of 747 jumbo jets to South Africa in a deal which drew strong
criticism from members of the state's congressional delegation.
   The aircraft maker and South African Transport Minister Eli Louw
said Saturday South African Airways would buy two Boeing 747-400s
and has options for two more aircraft.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said he thinks Boeing
officials know there are strong feelings in the United States and
Seattle about South Africa's system of apartheid. Foley said Boeing
Commercial Airplanes President Dean Thornton told him Boeing's
policy is to sell planes without regard to foreign policy as long
as the sale is legal.

   California's state employee pension fund, the
nation's biggest, says it might back an attempt by other major
Exxon Corp. shareholders to pressure the company to better prepare
for future environmental disasters in the wake of its Alaskan oil
spill.
   A spokesman for the California Public Employee Retirement
System, which owns 8 million shares amounting to about 0.6 percent
of Exxon's outstanding common stock, said Friday the fund may back
New York City's plan to use its holdings in an effort to advocate
the company change its spill strategies.

   Insurance company officials, freed by a
state Supreme Court ruling from the prospect of mandatory rate
rollbacks, say they could adapt to the rest of an insurance
initiative passed by voters last fall.
   The court's ruling Thursday upheld most of Proposition 103, a
consumer-sponsored initiative that gives the state greater control
over insurers. But the court rejected parts of the initiative that
called for mandatory rollbacks and a one-year freeze of auto,
property and liability rates at 20 percent below November 1987
levels.

   The investigation of New York's commodity
exchanges is narrower than an ongoing probe of Chicago futures
markets but focuses on fundamental trading practices common to both
operations.
   Officials close to the investigations by the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and Manhattan U.S attorney's office Friday said
investigators were focusing on a few individual traders, not the
exchanges at large, and the FBI is not involved.

   Precious metal futures prices dropped on New York's Commodity
Exchange while on other markets, grain and soybean prices were up,
livestock and meat prices were mixed, and oil prices were down.
