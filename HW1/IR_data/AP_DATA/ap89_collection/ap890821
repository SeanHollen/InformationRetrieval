   Two Virginia men are under arrest, accused
of plotting to kidnap a boy to be tortured and killed in a
pornographic videotape, officials said Monday.
   U.S. Attorney Henry Hudson identified the two as Dean Ashley
Lambey, 34, of Richmond, and Daniel Depew, 28, of Alexandria.
   Both were charged with conspiracy to kidnap, according to Will
Garrett, an FBI spokesman for the agency's Richmond field office.
They were being held without bail pending indictment by a grand
jury, Hudson said.
   Authorities said no kidnapping took place.
   The two men allegedly used computer bulletin board networks to
advertise their sexual preference, according to Tuesday's editions
of The Washington Post.
   One of the men allegedly told officials he would be able to use
an out-of-state source to purchase a child for $12,000, according to
an official who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of
anonymity.
   Hudson and FBI Special Agent W. Douglas Gow said the
investigation leading up to the Aug. 14 arrests was begun six months
ago by the San Jose, Calif., police department.
   Lambey is alleged to have told undercover officers from
California that he wanted to find a preadolescent, white boy to be
used in a sexually explicit ``snuff'' video, the officials said. The
name refers to a video or film subject's life being ``snuffed out.''
   ``The plan was to kidnap a child from northern Virginia or
purchase the child through a group of people,'' Hudson said.
   Authorities said the boy was to be held for up to two weeks _
while being videotaped _ and then killed.
   Lambey was arrested in Richmond while Depew was arrested in the
Washington, D.C., area, Hudson said.
   Depew is alleged to have told the undercover officers that he
intended to use his house in Richmond to make the video, officials
said. Hudson said federal officials are filing a court request to
seize the house.
   Hudson said over 100 FBI agents from California, Virginia and the
District of Columbia eventually took part in the investigation, as
well as officers from the Chesterfield County, Va., police
department.
   He said police put the pair under 24-hour surveillance
immediately upon learning of the plan to make sure that a kidnapping
could not accomplished.
   Hudson said the California officers traveled to Virginia as part
of their investigation.

   Northwest Airlines pilots have ratified a
tentative contract offer with NWA Inc. that ends 2{ years of
negotiations, the Air Line Pilots Association reported Monday.
   The Northwest Master Executive Council ratified the contract
Sunday.
   The same contract was ratified last week by co-workers who are
former Republic Airlines pilots.
   The joint ratification covers 5,200 pilots and marks the first
time both pilot groups will be working under the same contract since
the Northwest-Republic merger in 1986.
   The agreement will boost pay between 16 percent and 37 percent
over its five-year life and create a separate, lower wage scale for
new hires.
   It also calls for job security measures to protect against
possible restructurings by the carrier's new owners.

   A hog that normally would sell for about
$100 at auction brought $4,150 when bidders opened their hearts and
wallets to help an injured 12-year-old boy.
   Ted Ernst had hoped to show his hog at the Flathead County Fair.
But less than two weeks ago, he fell 60 feet from a tree and was
paralyzed from the waist down.
   Ted is in a Missoula hospital, learning to get around in a
wheelchair. His younger brother, Jesse, showed the hog instead.
   After explaining why Jesse was handling the animal for his
brother on Saturday, the auctioneer opened the bidding on the
240-pound hog at $2 a pound.
   The bidding finally stopped at $4 a pound _ for a total of $960.
   But then people in the crowd started yelling out donations to
help pay for Ted's medical bills. The donations kept rolling in for
about 20 minutes _ and the end result was $4,150.

<HEAD>Self-Proclaimed Prophet Reschedules Rapture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the world ends next week, the few who
are chosen will be able to park their cars in heaven, says the man
who also was predicting apocalypse about this time last year.
   ``We'll be able to land our airplanes, to drive our cars and park
them,'' said Edgar Whisenant, the self-proclaimed prophet, ``and
then go on up into the clouds of the Earth to the judgment seat of
Christ.''
   Whisenant, who predicted last year that the rapture would come
Sept. 12, 1988, has set a new date.
   The end of the world is Sept. 1, give or take a day, Whisenant
said.
   He has mailed his paperback book, ``The Final Shout: Rapture
Report 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993,'' to preachers across the
country.
   But like the boy who cried wolf, Whisenant is having trouble
finding believers this year, The News and Observer of Raleigh
reported Sunday.
   ``He blew his credibility last year,'' said Joanna Hicks,
co-owner of three Sign of the Fish bookstores in Raleigh and nearby
Cary, who sold more than a thousand of Whisenant's books last summer.
   ``Nobody that's naming the time and the date gets another chance
if he's wrong,'' Mrs. Hicks said, adding that there has been no
interest in the new book.
   The rapture in some Christian theologies refers to the second
coming of Jesus, when true believers will be taken to heaven and
disbelievers will be judged. Many mainline Christians believe Jesus
will return to Earth, but most are suspicious of prophets who try to
name the date.
   Last summer, Christian radio station WPJL-AM in Raleigh broadcast
advertisements about the rapture, paid for by local believers.
   Program director Jim Stephens said he sensed no interest in the
rescheduled rapture.
   ``People maybe felt like they were burned'' when the world did
not end last year, he said.
   Whisenant brushes aside such comments.
   ``You can't have a scoffer until you have a true message being
given,'' said Whisenant, 56. ``And the scoffers are coming out of
the woodwork this year.''
   Whisenant acknowledged that he has been diagnosed as a paranoid
schizophrenic. But he said the illness had been controlled by
medicine and has no influence on his predictions, which are based on
the Bible, he said.
   A retired NASA engineer who lives in Little Rock, Ark., Whisenant
said his calculations were off last year because he miscounted the
number of years in the first century.
   He is 96 percent certain the rapture will come in 1989, he said.
If it doesn't, he places a 1 percent chance on each year from 1990
to 1993.
   ``No way is it going past '93,'' he said.

   Photos of Neptune taken by Voyager 2 this
week will be appearing on television sets in homes around the
country during the flyby. And, for the price of a telephone call,
Voyager enthusiasts will be listening to NASA news updates on the
mission.
   Many cable television subscribers and people with satellite
dishes will be watching closed-circuit NASA Select television
broadcasts of the Voyager photos. More than 3,000 cable TV
companies, observatories, universities and other institutions were
invited to transmit NASA programming over public access channels or
to audiences in planetariums or auditoriums.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration planned the
broadcasts from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m. PDT today through Wednesday; from
9 a.m. PDT probably through the night on Aug. 24; from 9 a.m. to 11
p.m. PDT Aug. 25-28; and from 9 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. PDT Aug. 29.
   Viewers must check with their local cable TV companies to learn
if the broadcasts will be carried in their city.
   Cable News Network planned brief live reports at 2 p.m., 5 p.m. 7
p.m. and 9 p.m. PDT, starting today.
   The special telephone line, (900) 590-1234, will provide
frequently updated, recorded status reports on the Voyager mission.
This line will carry live audio from the news conferences that were
scheduled to start at 10 a.m. PDT daily today through Aug. 29. The
cost of calls to this line is 45 cents for the first minute and 35
cents for each additional minute.
   Similar programs are available by calling (818) 354-4227, (818)
354-0409, or (818) 354-7292, special lines at JPL. Normal
long-distance charges apply.
   On its TV broadcasts, NASA Select will show Voyager 2's
photographs of Neptune, its moons and partial rings, and also will
carry live news conferences by Voyager scientists. There will be
short hourly programs about Voyager at Neptune.
   Satellite dish owners throughout most of the United States may
receive NASA Select by tuning to GE Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, 71
degrees west longitude, 3960 megahertz, vertical polarity.
   Satellite dish owners in Alaska and Hawaii should tune to Aurora
1, Transponder 21, 143 west longitude, 4120 megahertz, vertical
polarity. Aurora 1 also may provide better reception than Satcom F2R
for West Coast dish owners.

<HEAD>Rare Plants Lack Protections of Endangered Animals</HEAD>

   Killing endangered animals can mean prison, but
landowners may with impunity pluck or bulldoze the last specimen of
the rarest plant on Earth.
   Federal and state agencies keep lists of hundreds of endangered
plants, some discovered so recently they haven't been given Latin
names. Yet laws that prohibit even molesting endangered animals
regulate only those plants on public land and the theft or sale of
rare flora.
   ``We are pointing our fingers at the developing nations of the
world, saying, `How can you destroy your rain forests,' yet here we
are allowing our own plant species to become extinct,'' says Jora
Young, director of stewardship for the Nature Conservancy in Florida.
   The lack of concern for plants is ironic, ecologists say, since
plants have been more useful than have animals. Besides providing
most of the food we eat, they produce morphine, aspirin, digitalis,
atropine, alcohol, mustard, menthol, quinine, curare, germicides,
pesticides and scores of other useful substances.
   ``A lot of plants may not be important now, but they may some day
save lives,'' says Richard Wunderlin, president of the Florida
Native Plant Society.
   Florida ranks third in the nation for the number of endangered
plants, behind California and Texas, Wunderlin said. It also boasts,
at least for now, many rare species found nowhere else in the
country, or even the world.
   In Florida, the problem is acute. Booming development is wiping
out native plant habitats from the hardwood hammocks in the tropical
Keys to scrub land in central Florida and pine woods along the
Apalachicola River.
   The state has created an Endangered Plant Advisory Council, but
its powers are limited to placing species on a list that merely
regulates their sale.
   ``We're adding more plants to the list all the time,'' says
council Chairman Dan Austin, a botany professor at Florida Atlantic
University in Boca Raton. ``But it doesn't protect the plants.
People can do just about anything they want, and nobody outside can
stop them.''
   Many environmentalists have given up on crowded southeastern
Florida. Austin said only 1 percent of the native scrub land in Palm
Beach County still survives; in Broward County it has all but
disappeared. The main battleground is now central Florida, where
rare plant species are succumbing not only to development but to the
spread of the citrus industry.
   Wunderlin points in frustration to a newly discovered species of
the rattlebox plant that is so new it doesn't even have a scientific
name. It is known only in two locations _ both housing developments
near Avon Park.
   ``The species is disappearing lot by lot. We will propose it be
put on the federal protective list but it's still on private
property, so that won't protect it at all. Each time we go into the
fields, more have disappeared.''
   The federal government lists only 27 plants for protection.
Plants on the list can't be destroyed if they are found on a
federally funded project such as a dam or public housing. But that
represents a tiny fraction of the development in most areas, Austin
said. The state does not have any similar prohibitions for the 139
endangered and 280 threatened plants on its list.
   Placing a plant on the list isn't always easy because development
and farm interests routinely oppose such efforts, Austin said. It
also gives landowners who find endangered plants on property they
intend to develop an incentive to destroy them quickly to avoid
later headaches. That's perfectly legal.
   ``If you're a developer and you own the last population of the
big pine partridge pea, you can bulldoze it,'' said Ms. Young. ``As
long as you don't steal if from a federal preserve or try to sell
it, you're OK.''
   Plants have historically gotten short shrift. Under old English
law, animals, which moved through the property of many people,
belonged to the crown, making them in effect a public trust. But
plants remained on one spot and were totally the property of the
landowner.
   And people, being animals themselves, are subject to what Ms.
Young called ``the Bambi syndrome.''
   ``If I talk about the impending extinction of the Key deer,
people say, `Oh, that's terrible. What can we do,'' she said. ``But
if I say, `This little mint that occurs only in two places on the
Lake Wales Ridge is very close to extinction,' they just shrug and
say, `That's too bad.'''
   That prejudice, she said, is not based on reality. Besides their
value to humans, lower plants are often food for higher animals, and
their destruction can have unknown implications on the environment.
   Although state officials and environmentalists see little hope
for a sudden broad shift in the legal and political climate, there
are some hopeful signs.
   Dade County has begun to protect some native trees, although
without protecting the habitat they need to survive, said Julia
Morton, a University of Miami biologist. ``It's only quantitative,
dealing with numbers.''
   Another alternative Ms. Morton found hopeful is transplanting
rare species to exotic plant nurseries, if the developing landowner
agrees.
   That approach, while often the only realistic one, is inadequate,
Wunderlin said. ``In the wild they are very variable genetically. By
removing only a few plants and cultivating them, you are preserving
only a very small proportion.''
   If they are reintroduced they can't resist extreme conditions, he
added.
   Environentalists and experts unanimously praised the Nature
Conservancy, which has bought 400,000 acres of environmentally
sensitive land around Florida over the last 25 years. It often acts
as an agent for the state, quickly buying the land and then holding
it until the state bureaucracy is ready to buy it.
   The Conservancy recently bought a site along the Apalachicola
River that is the last refuge of an endangered evergreen tree. It
has preserved ancient dunes in the Lake Wales Ridge area that are
the only known home of endangered species such as the scrub plum and
the pygmy fringe tree. And it is buying hammock areas on Key Largo
that harbor a variety of tree and plant species.
   Despite an increase in environmental consciousness, Austin said,
protecting animals while ignoring plants is ``like a watchmaker
taking a watch apart and throwing half the pieces away then trying
to put it back together.''
   Each day, environmentalists say, more pieces of the watch are
disappearing.

<HEAD>Chinese Students Face Hurdles to Get U.S. Visas</HEAD>

   BEIJING _ The hundreds of Chinese who line up daily for visas to
the United States are being questioned more closely by American
officials since the government crushed the student democracy
movement in Tianamen Square in June.
   The Americans' concern is that those who get visas _ students in
particular because they are young and usually single _ won't come
back to China once the visas expire.
   ``I challenge anyone to think that 1 percent of those applying
for visas now wants to come back,'' said Embassy spokesman Sheridan
Bell.
   Not only do Chinese face closer police scrutiny when applying for
passports and exit permits from their own government, they also must
convince U.S. visa officers that they will return home.
   Zhang, 23, with blue jeans and a fondness for American slang,
waited in line outside the Embassy one recent morning with his
letter of acceptance from a school in Arkansas.
   ``No sweat,'' he said, confident of his chances.
   He came out two hours later.
   ``No way,'' he said glumly, explaining he was turned down because
he couldn't persuade a U.S. official he would come home.
   Another student, Huang, a government employee in his 30s, was
accepted into a West Virginia college's computer program.
   ``Why wouldn't I come back?'' he said before seeing a consular
official, explaining why he should get a visa. ``I have a beautiful
baby and a wife and a relatively decent job.''
   Like Zhang, he was on his second try in a month, and like Zhang
he was rejected again.
   ``I heard the record is 15 times,'' Huang said.
   Since June's crackdown, the Canadian Embassy has issued student
visas more freely than before _ as a humanitarian gesture, it said.
The visa process also has been shortened by weeks.
   But a U.S. Embassy source, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said it is much harder now for students not sponsored by the Chinese
government to get American visas. Those whose tuition is
government-paid have the highest return rate because their families
are forced to pay if they fail to come home. They make up most of
the estimated 40,000 Chinese now studying in the United States.
   Spokesman Bell said the consular section gave visas to 744
privately funded students in June, when the Embassy was closed for
two weeks, and July. He refused to say how many were rejected, but
said about 165 such students apply each day.
   Even allowing for days with low turnouts, that would mean five of
every six applicants have been turned away.
   The application process is arduous. It now takes about six weeks
to get a passport and exit permit from the Chinese governnment,
compared to about four weeks before the crackdown, as police weed
out those they regard as ``counter-revolutionaries.''
   Applicants must bring letters from their Chinese schools or
employers certifying they did not take part in the student protests.
   But getting a passport, said one thin youth, was easy compared
with getting a U.S. visa.
   Applicants sometimes wait outside for days to get a ticket for an
interview. They line up at 8:30 a.m. on their appointed day to wait
for their numbers to be called.
   So intense is their desire to get to the United States that many
applicants spend extra days outside the embassy huddled with other
applicants, endlessly exchanging tips.
   ``I heard that students with full scholarships have a 90 percent
chance of getting visas, those with partial scholarships have a 50
percent chance and those relying entirely on sponsors to pay have
almost no chance,'' said a man who was trying for the second time.
   A dozen students listened intently.
   ``Nursing and teaching majors are no good,'' he said
authoritatively. ``The United States is short of nurses and teachers
and they'll think you want to stay. ... It helps if you come from a
name school or are going to a name school in the United States, like
Yale.''
   The only topic of conversation is how to please the consuls, whom
everyone knows by room number if not name.
   No. 1 is a woman. ``She's the easiest,'' said the skinny youth.
``No. 2 we call Left-Hand because he writes with his left hand. He's
the toughest. Nos. 3 and 4 are about average.''
   Some say Friday seems to be the easiest day to get a visa. Others
recommend trying for an early morning interview, before the consuls
get tired and hungry. A rich sponsor can help, but not too rich,
advised one experienced applicant, because the consul might think
you'll be tempted to stay.
   Many Chinese expressed bewilderment that the U.S. Congress is
planning to extend the visas of Chinese students already in the
United States, fearing they'll be punished for supporting the
protests, but has not relaxed the rules for those who actually
marched to Tianamen Square.
   ``Our government could close the door at any time,'' said one
woman whose husband is studying in the United States. ``Why does the
United States say he can stay, but not let me go see him?''

<TEXT>
   Atlanta has long been a magnet for homosexuals in
the Southeast who felt they'd never be accepted in smaller towns.
   ``It's a little island of enlightenment in a sea of bigotry,''
said Gil Robinson, a lobbyist for several Atlanta gay groups.
   They've never been forced to take to the streets to fight for
equality here, but with an estimated 300,000 homosexuals in the
metropolitan area, the gay community has become a well-organized,
potent political force. Nowhere has that been more apparent than in
the race to succeed Mayor Andrew Young.
   ``I think gay and lesbian people here are becoming a real
political power, probably getting close to New York, San Francisco
and Los Angeles,'' said Richard Swanson, administrator of the
Atlanta Gay Center.
   Fulton County Commission Chairman Michael Lomax and former Mayor
Maynard Jackson, the two leading Democratic candidates in the Oct. 3
election until Lomax dropped out this month, vigorously campaigned
in the gay community.
   Both had detailed platforms on gay issues, promising to seek
funds for housing for people with AIDS, to appoint gay men and
lesbians to city posts and to establish police task forces to combat
unprovoked assaults on homosexuals.
   The city's gay population has never before been courted so
openly, said Jeffrey Laymon, executive secretary of the Metropolitan
Atlanta Council of Gay and Lesbian Organizations. ``We do have the
numbers now. The political situation has changed. They have to pay
attention.''
   Even those who oppose affirmative-action programs inclusion of
homosexuals agree that Atlanta's gay population has developed some
muscle.
   ``I think it's anti-family and it's anti-God,'' said Nancy
Schaefer, chairwoman of Citizens for Public Awareness, which has
fought to repeal a city ordinance amendment giving gay residents
protection from discrimination. Atlanta has become a ``haven'' for
homosexuals, she said.
   Unlike San Francisco or New York, the rise of gay power here came
not with a surge of militancy, but rather gradually. Gay activism
surfaced in America in the early 1970s and by the time Atlanta's
homosexual population reached significant numbers much of the work
had already been done.
   ``By 1980, attitudes about equality had already changed or
moderated across the country,'' Swanson said. ``There probably
wasn't a great need to get out and march. We're able to achieve much
more with a lower-key approach.''
   He cited Atlanta's status as a center of the civil rights
movement and its Southern gentility for the lack of confrontation
over gay issues.``A lot of gay and lesbian people tend to be from
the smaller towns in the South. They still have a lot of that
traditional Southern mentality.''
   Midtown Atlanta, a hodgepodge of high-rise office towers,
comfortable neighborhoods, nightclubs and shopping centers, is the
center of gay life. But it's a lifestyle that has been quietly woven
into the city's society.
   ``We're invisible,'' said Marie Murray of the Greater Atlanta
Political Awareness Committee, GAPAC. ``We don't just care about gay
issues. We're interested in all of the issues that everybody else
is.''
   Still, many gay activists say their greatest victory was the 1986
addition of sexual orientation to an anti-discrimination ordinance.
It has survived one repeal effort; CPA is trying again to have the
amendment thrown out.
   Mrs. Schaefer said she does not believe a sexual preference group
should be considered a minority, particularly in affirmative action
programs. She does believe that heightened gay political power bodes
ill for the city.
   ``It concerns me where the city is heading. When the morals of
the city start falling apart, we will suffer the consequences,'' she
said, adding that the suburbs will become conservative in reaction
to gay clout within the city.
   Many gay men and lesbians own prosperous businesses _ with money
to contribute to politicians _ and are active in one or more of the
dozens of gay and lesbian organizations that rate politics high on
their agenda.
   Jackson campaign spokesman Angelo Fuster said the gay population
is ``very important'' in building a successful coalition with
Atlanta's black majority to win a citywide election. And many
politicians no longer fear a backlash if they openly support gay
issues. ``Although there is a lot of homophobia, it has lessened
considerably,'' he said.
   Lomax recently reached out for the gay vote with a proposal to
include gay-owned businesses in a study of Fulton County's
affirmative action program.
   Les Hough, a specialist in Southern politics at Georgia State
University, said the proposal shows the role gay voters _ especially
white ones _ play in predominantly black Atlanta. ``By appealing to
the margins, to the single-issue groups, you can solidify your white
support,'' he said.
   ``In a close race, it can make a big difference.''
   The prominence of gay issues in Atlanta shows the differences
between city and country in Georgia, where no gubernatorial
candidates mention gay rights as an important platform plank, he
said. ``Anyone who had ambitions of statewide office in Georgia ...
would downplay gay rights issues in any race.''
   Swanson said gay men and lesbians have simply become part of the
fabric of Atlanta, coming of age along with the fast-growing city.
``A high percentage of the gay people in Atlanta now have 15-plus
years of being involved in the community. All that is paying off
now.''

<HEAD>Tamil Rivalry Claims Nightly Victims ... of `Target Practice'</HEAD>

   The power struggle within the Tamil
minority claims new victims every night as gunfire reverberates
throughout this war-battered town.
   ``We are now so brutalized that revenge, revenge and more revenge
is our credo. We are wiping out our own Tamil youth,'' said
Vellupillai Balakumar, general secretary of the Eelam People's
Revolutionary Organization of Students.
   Balakumar's group, known by its acronym EROS, is widely thought
to have close ties with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the
most powerful Tamil guerrilla group.
   For the past 22 months, the Tigers have fought the Indian
peacekeeping troops who were sent to disarm them. But they also are
part of a shadowy war for supremacy within the Tamil community.
   Nights in Jaffna are shattered by gunfire and explosions.
   Visitors who ask the staff at the Gnanam Hotel, one of the few
Jaffna hostelries still open, what is going on receive a stock
answer: ``Nothing, sir. Somebody is doing some target practice.''
   The next morning the targets _ young Tamil men _ are found lying
in pools of blood in the streets of Jaffna and surrounding villages.
   ``We don't know who is killing whom, but the dead turn up almost
as a ritual every morning and the sounds of gunfires, explosions,
crying and wailing are part of our daily nightlife,'' a senior Tamil
newspaper editor said on condition of anonymity.
   ``The brutalization has reached such an extent that it is part of
our lives,'' he said. ``No one is interested even in knowing who a
dead corpse is.''
   Like many Jaffna residents, he blamed the bulk of the killings on
the Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front, whose members are
permitted by the Indian troops to carry arms openly.
   The Liberation Front and two other Tamil groups support the
Indian presence and have the most to lose if the Indian soldiers
depart, leaving them to the mercy of the Tiger guerrillas. The
front, once a guerrilla organization, has entered politics and
controls the provincial administrative council.
   Tamil militants and civic leaders estimate at least 10,000 people
have died in predominantly Tamil northeastern Sri Lanka since July
30, 1987, when Indian troops arrived to enforce a peace accord
designed to give the ethnic minority a measure of autonomy. That's
far above the estimate from Sri Lankan and Indian government
sources, whose total since the Tamil revolt began in 1983 comes to
11,000.
   Tamil rebels initially accepted the Indian-sponsored peace plan,
but the Tigers soon reneged and began attacking the foreign soldiers
sent to disarm them. Score-settling and power struggles broke out
among the erstwhile Tamil guerrilla allies.
   The Tigers said they wanted a separate homeland, not autonomy.
Militants in the Tamil community said they needed a separate state
to preserve their Hindu faith, Tamil language and combat what they
said was discrimination by the island's Sinhalese majority.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese, who are mostly Buddhist and control the government,
account for 75 percent.
   The violence that worries people in Jaffna, which used to have a
population of 150,000 but now suffers constant migration, is
reflected by the prevalence of bodies.
   Taxi drivers, when asked if they know where to find any victims
of the previous night's gunfire, tend to respond as Nadarajah
Sivagurunathan did when a passenger hopped in his 35-year-old Morris
Minor.
   ``There are two bodies in Kondavil, one near Nallur, two others
at Kokuvil, but one closer to Jaffna town near the railway line,''
Sivagurunathan said, reeling off a list of locations within five
miles of downtown Jaffna. ``Where shall we go?''
   By nightfall, in the courtyard of the Gnanam Hotel, a Tamil
crooner sings a love song.
   ``The night scares me because you are not here by me.
   ``Why do you expose my vulnerability to a cruel world?
   ``Come here and hold my hand, I am scared,'' he sings to the
hotel staff and a half-dozen guests.
   Suddenly, his Tamil-language song is punctuated by the
all-too-familiar sound of machine gunfire and screams.
   The singer pauses and reassures his listeners in English:
   ``Nothing sir, only target practice.''

<TEXT>
   Blond, blue-eyed American soldiers
with wolf-like grins, claws for hands and long, hooked noses leer
from the walls of the war museum in rural Sinchon County.
   The passage of 36 years has not softened North Koreans' attitudes
toward the army they maintain was the aggressor in the 1950-53
Korean War between the Chinese-aided north and U.N.-backed south.
   In the 11 rooms of the Sinchon Museum, North Korea presents what
it says is evidence that American soldiers of the U.N. force killed
35,383 civilians while occupying the country for 52 days from
October to Dec. 7, 1950.
   The claims never have been investigated by neutral parties, nor
have claims in South Korean that northern forces committed similar
atrocities there. The sides, divided at the end of World War II when
Japanese forces withdrew, remain technically at war. The fighting
was ended only by truce, not a peace treaty.
   Sinchon Museum guides tell the atrocity stories with impassioned
conviction to about 1,000 North Korean visitors each day, many of
them schoolchildren, reinforcing the prevailing image here of the
United States as a warmonger bent on exterminating all Koreans.
   Glass cases hold fire-charred cloth shoes said to be from women
and children locked in storehouses without food or water and
eventually burned to death by the Americans.
   Other cases hold swatches of black hair, some still braided and
caked with mud, said to have been recovered from the corpses of
women weighted down by stones and thrown into a reservoir.
   There is a dagger said to have been used to cut out the eyeballs
of civilians, and a gasoline can with USA on the side that allegedly
was used to start one of the massacre fires.
   The horrific accounts are illustrated by artists' reconstructions
in which all the Americans are blond, with impossibly long, hooked
noses and evil grins.
   The soldiers allegedly drove nails into a local official, sawed
off the head of a teacher and tied a worker to two horse-drawn
carts, then sent the horses in opposite directions.
   The worker's son, Chu Sang-won, then 5 years old, is said to have
been one of only two children who survived a mass burning of 400
women and 102 children in two brick storehouses on Dec. 7, 1950, the
final day of occupation.
   The younger Chu, now 43 and with three children of his own, gives
tours at the museum and daily retells the story of the burning.
   ``I was covered by a thick blanket _ it was very cold,'' Chu
said. ``Suddenly there was a big noise, everything was burnt and I
lost consciousness.'' He said he was protected by the blanket and
dead bodies. His mother burned to death, he said.
   The short, sunburned man told his story briefly, with no sign of
emotion. ``I hate those who committed such a cold-blooded
massacre,'' he said, but not the American people.
   The storehouses are near the museum and are part of the tour, but
contain little to convince a doubter. One was completely rebuilt
after being destroyed by a bomb later in the war. The other has a
new concrete floor and reinforced walls.
   Muddy black-and-white photographs also are shown to support the
stories, but it is clear only that they show large numbers of
bodies. A few are crudely doctored, with portions obviously drawn in
or superimposed from other photos.
   But the museum clearly exists not to convince skeptics, but to
hand down accounts that the North Koreans accept as history.
   There seems to be no interest in punishing the alleged killers.
Museum vice chairman Im Kyon-sun said they have not tried to track
down the American officer they claim ordered his troops to ``bury
alive everything in this county.''
   Im identified the soldier as D. Madden Harrison, but said his
rank and unit were not known. ``He was very cunning,'' said Im, who
fought in the war as a private.
   While the other Americans retreated south by land in November and
December 1950 before a North Korean-Chinese advance, Harrison
escaped by boat to an island, Im said.
   ``There he served as an intelligence unit commander and organized
sending agents to Korea. Then we don't know what happened to him.''
   The museum contains only one photo of the mysterious Harrison,
and that of his back. Someone has drawn several links of a chain
hanging from his pocket.
   The museum was opened in 1958, but new exhibits have been added
over the years. Among them are photos of an unusual group of
visitors: the crew of the U.S. Navy ship Pueblo, captured for 11
months in 1968 on charges of spying.

   A handsome, charismatic 19th century
African named Cinque is the rallying point for a group of history
buffs who want to raise funds for a statue of the leader of mutinous
Africans who commandeered a slave ship.
   If organizers can raise the needed $100,000, Cinque's statue
would be placed near City Hall, not far from where the old New Haven
Jail once stood where the Africans were housed after their ship was
brought to port following their mutiny 150 years ago this week.
Across the street is the New Haven Green, where the Africans were
supposedly taken out for daily exercise, drawing hundreds of curious
onlookers.
   The Aug. 26, 1839, mutiny and its aftermath galvanized
abolitionists and led to a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1841
allowing their return to their homeland.
   The story of the bid for freedom which began as they were being
transported from one side of Cuba to another, is gripping, said
historian Howard Jones, a University of Alabama professor who wrote
a 1987 book on the case, ``Mutiny on the Amistad.''
   ``It is a real epic in that it is the only time in history blacks
were put in slavery and made it back home,'' Jones said in a
telephone interview.
   But the Supreme Court ruling was no watershed decision, because
the blacks were freed only on the basis of a technicality., he said.
   The court held only that the Spaniards in Cuba seeking the return
of the Africans had failed to prove they were their property.
Justice Joseph Story, who wrote the court's decision, ``made it very
clear that if they were legally slaves he could not have freed
them,'' Jones said.
   Abolitionists saw the decision as ``taking an important step in
stamping out slavery,'' Jones said. ``In fact, it wasn't, but the
impression was it did.''
   The real importance lies in the opportunity the Amistad Affair
gave abolitionists to rally behind the Africans, to ``advertise the
horrors of the slave trade,'' Jones said.
   ``Abolitionists were determined to get them before the American
people to show them they were not animals,'' Jones said.
   The case generated a tremendous amount of publicity and
curiosity; many people in the region had never see a black, Jones
said. Jailers were said to have charged admission to give people a
glimpse of the detainees.
   ``At first they thought they were barbarians, but then they saw
these people were human beings and were greatly amazed by them,'' he
said.
   Cinque _ whose name was appropriated in the 1970s by the leader
of California's radical Symbionese Liberation Army, kidnappers of
newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst _ apparently had a tremendous
amount of charisma and was extremely handsome, Jones said.
   An oil portrait of him by the brother of a leading abolitionist
will be prominently displayed during the New Haven Colony Historical
Society's exhibit on the Amistad Affair.
   An African art show is currently going on and a wide range of
activities is planned throughout the year, including lectures, a
drama and a community banquet. A historian is preparing booklets on
the affair to be used in local schools this fall.

<HEAD>New Life Ahead For Dotson After DNA Test Ends 12-Year Ordeal</HEAD>

   Gary Dotson's life these past dozen years was a
roller-coaster ride he didn't start and couldn't stop, until a new
DNA test helped do what his accuser turned tearful recanter never
could: clear him of rape.
   A book and a movie are being considered, a civil suit against the
criminal justice system that set Dotson's torturous odyssey in
motion is possible, and college is another option on his suddenly
expanding horizon, his lawyer says.
   But Thomas Breen, the attorney, says the most important matter at
hand is to return the 32-year-old Dotson to sound emotional footing.
   ``Let's be honest,'' Breen said. ``He wasn't the most sympathetic
character in the world, but it would have been impossible for almost
anyone to toe the line he had to walk _ especially someone with a
drinking problem.
   ``On the other hand, anybody who doesn't have compassion or
sympathy for a kid that was jailed for part of his life for a crime
that never occurred, well, that person has a bigger problem than my
client.''
   Dotson's problems began in 1977 when Cathleen Crowell Webb, then
a high school student, claimed she had been sexually assaulted and
identified Dotson as her attacker. She said in 1985, after she had
moved to New Hampshire, that she was never attacked, and had wrongly
accused Dotson.
   But by then he had been convicted of the rape and sent to tough
state prisons where he ended up serving six years. Based on Mrs.
Webb's recantation, he was granted clemency by Gov. James R.
Thompson _ allowing him to leave prison in May 1985. But the rape
conviction stayed on his record.
   Finally, last Monday, he was cleared when Cook County Circuit
Judge Thomas Fitzgerald vacated the 1979 rape conviction and
prosecutors said they would not seek a new trial. Fitzgerald said
recent DNA tests of evidence from the rape case would be admissible
if a new trial were held. Defense lawyers said the DNA
``fingerprinting'' tests _ which did not exist a decade ago _
indicated Dotson could not have been responsible for the semen found
in Mrs. Webb's panties.
   Prosecutors suggested that a lack of corroborating evidence and
Mrs. Webb's testimony would be greater obstacles to a second rape
conviction than the new DNA test.
   Mrs. Webb's recantation is still ``shrouded in mystery'' and her
actions since coming forward in 1985 ``have had a negative impact on
her future reliability as a witness,'' said Assistant Cook County
State's Attorney Gayle Shines.
   Dotson walked out of Fitzgerald's courtroom last week looking
tanned, more fit and confident than he had in recent years.
   ``It's over,'' Dotson told a crowd of reporters. ``As they say,
this is the first day of the rest of my life. ... As far as I'm
concerned, my name has been cleared.''
   He said he harbored no animosity against Mrs. Webb. ``I forgave
her a long time ago,'' he said.
   The role of Mrs. Webb, now of Harrisville, N.H., is puzzling.
   Mrs. Webb said she concocted the tale of rape because she feared
she had become pregnant by a teen-age boyfriend. A born-again
Baptist and the mother of three children, she said ``obedience to
God'' prompted her to come forward and recant her accusations.
   She encountered ridicule in many quarters, failed to convince a
judge or Thompson of Dotson's innocence, and gained little but
notoriety for all the time and money expended.
   Yet, she was heartened by last week's developments.
   ``I wanted to see Gary's name cleared,'' she said during a
television interview at her New Hampshire home. ``That's done, but I
won't feel right until his life is restored to where it was before I
pointed the finger at him.''
   Dotson's initial trial and appeal lasted two years, draining his
family's meager resources.
   The four years since his 1985 release found him battling an
alcohol problem, arrested a half-dozen times for traffic violations
and another time following a domestic disturbance. He was put back
behind bars several times. He got married, became a father and
almost as quickly separated from his wife.
   Celebrity was a millstone, bringing taunts from strangers in
taverns and on the street. But he was unwilling to give up the
struggle to clear his name.
   Dotson was granted a temporary pass to attend last Monday's
hearing from the drug and alcohol-abuse center where he had been
serving a year-long sentence for a parole violation. He plans to
spend at least another month there _ on a voluntary basis.
   Dotson, of suburban County Club Hills, is hoping to build on the
bitter years. He said schooling was his most immediate concern,
followed perhaps by a career in counseling.
   ``I've been through enough to relate to a lot of problems,'' he
said.

   Frankly, Fritz the schnauzer doesn't know
an arpeggio from a doggie bone. But when he plink-plonks a few notes
on the family grand piano, his mistress beams admiringly as if Van
Cliburn himself were tickling the ivories.
   As far as Shirley Mae Ross is concerned, Fritz is a doggone
sensation.
   ``He is by far my best student,'' says Mrs. Ross, who gives piano
lessons to children in the living room of her suburban Washington
home. ``He's not a pet. He's an artist.''
   Twelve-year-old Fritz has been ``playing'' the piano since he was
a pup. To show off for visitors, he leaps to the keyboard, frowns
his shaggy eyebrows at a book of Beethoven sonatas, and taps out a
chord or two with his front paws.
   Fritz then races into the kitchen and, wagging his stubby tail,
waits next to a cabinet door for his reward: a dog biscuit.
   ``He has to be paid immediately,'' says Mrs. Ross. ``He belongs
to the dog musicians' union.''
   He gets a biscuit and a half for overtime, presumably. ``He plays
ad nauseam,'' she says. ``It's almost impossible to stop him.''
   This spring, Fritz became something of a celebrity when he
appeared in a new book titled ``Dogs and Their Women,'' published by
Little, Brown and Co. There, on page 15, is a picture of Fritz
seated at the piano with his mistress, supposedly playing a duet.
   ``Get cracking, Shirley, or we won't end together,'' Fritz is
saying in the photo caption.
   Elsewhere in the book _ a testament in words and pictures to the
love affairs between some women and their dogs _ is the woman who
said she ``replaced a six-foot Swedish husband with a five-pound
dog.'' Another is shown in her wedding gown, kissing the dog who was
her ``maid of honor, flower girl, best man and the one who gave me
away.''
   Mrs. Ross was grieving over the death of her previous schnauzer
when her husband, Denwood F. Ross Jr., an official at the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, brought Fritz home as a 6-week-old
replacement. ``He's slept under the covers in my arms every since,''
she said.
   At the urging of her piano pupils, Mrs. Ross taught Fritz how to
play.
   ``He loved to tear up Kleenex tissues. So I put some Kleenex on
the piano keys, and when he'd hit a note inadvertently, I'd say,
`Oh, Fritz, you wonderful dog,' and feed him a biscuit,'' she said.
``He was trained within a week. He just loves to play the piano. And
he has perfect pitch.''
   Fritz accompanies Mrs. Ross to nursing homes and senior citizen
centers where his keyboard performances are eagerly awaited. He
plays three movements, interrupted by applause and munchies, she
says.
   ``Usually Fritz plays an andante first, then a largo for the
second movement, and he always ends with a presto,'' she said. ``He
does cadenzas all over the place. Everything he does is cadenzas.''
   When Fritz travels, he carries his own suitcase packed with a
jogging suit, a plaid raincoat and a mink coat. ``It's f-a-k-e, of
course, but we mustn't let him know that,'' Mrs. Ross whispers.
   When they visit her father in Oil City, Pa., at Christmas time,
she says, Fritz wears a Santa Claus suit to perform at the nursing
home.
   ``He hates it because the cap flops down over his eyes when he
plays,'' she said.

   Five months after he retired from a 16-year
career in Congress, Missouri Republican Gene Taylor reached into his
old campaign fund-raising account and took home $345,000.
   It was perfectly legal thanks to a decade-old law, but even so,
Taylor's decision highlights a practice that is drawing criticism as
ethics questions simmer in Congress.
   President Bush has proposed outlawing the practice and the Senate
already has voted to ban it. The debate could shift this fall to the
House, which has vigorously resisted such proposals because its
members are the ones that would be affected and they have millions
of dollars at stake.
   ``It amounts to a special interest-financed retirement fund,''
complains Susan Manes of Common Cause, a government watchdog group
that advocates an overhaul of the system for financing congressional
campaigns.
   ``The ethics spotlight has been trained on Congress,'' said Ms.
Manes.
   Advocates of a change in campaign finance law say lawmakers may
have to act on the issue soon to salve public concerns over ethics
scandals in Congress such as the one that led to the resignation of
House Speaker Jim Wright.
   Taylor belongs to an exclusive club of current and former House
members permitted under a 10-year-old law to take leftover cash from
their re-election treasuries for personal use after they leave
office.
   According to records of the Federal Election Commission, Taylor
has converted more surplus campaign cash to personal use than any
other former lawmaker. But Taylor bristles at the attention the news
media have given his use of campaign donations.
   ``I haven't done anything wrong,'' says Taylor. ``I do a lot of
things out there for public service. I'm going to use some of it for
that.''
   The law allows House members in office before Jan. 8, 1980, to
convert excess campaign money to personal use.
   Currently, 191 House members are covered by that ``grandfather
clause'' and they had cash reserves of $39 million in their
re-election accounts at the start of the year.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., had $1.16 million at the end of June
and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., had $1.01 million in his campaign
account.
   A Senate rule prohibits current and former members from spending
campaign money for personal use. But practically speaking, it can't
be enforced once a senator leaves office. House rules prohibit
current members from spending campaign money for personal use.
   Any retiring House or Senate member can contribute leftover
campaign money to a political party, other political campaigns,
charitable organizations, or transfer the money to a trust or
foundation for educational, scientific or religious purposes.
   Some members return the money to contributors. But former members
have transferred at least $862,000 in surplus campaign money to
personal use after leaving office since 1980, according to a report
earlier this year by Congressional Quarterly.
   When Taylor left office in January, his campaign committee listed
a balance of $457,938. During the first six months of this year, he
contributed $64,200 to churches and colleges in southwest Missouri,
gave $2,500 to political candidates and spent about $8,600 on other
items, including automobile insurance and airline tickets.
   At the end of June he transferred $345,000 to himself by writing
two personal checks. Campaign money converted to personal use is
subject to state and federal taxation, and Taylor estimates nearly
40 percent of the transfer will go for taxes.
   Last month the Senate approved a bill to repeal the loophole.
   ``When donors contribute to a political candidate they do so with
an understanding that their money will be used to further the
candidate's campaign, not to augment his or her personal wealth,''
said Sen. Richard Shelby, D-Ala., the sponsor of the repeal
legislation.
   President Bush has offered another solution, proposing to bar
candidates from carrying over campaign money from one election to
another. A House task force also is studying the issue as it tries
to develop an ethics and campaign finance package.

<HEAD>Federal Agencies Disagree on Foreign Sale of Supercomputers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARTON REPPERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House apparently will have to settle
a dispute among federal agencies over whether to allow the sale of
supercomputers to Brazil, India and Israel, which are known to be
involved in nuclear weapons programs, a congressional source says.
   The Pentagon and CIA oppose the sales because intelligence
experts believe the supercomputers could be used to help design
nuclear weapons and missiles, the source said on Sunday.
   The Commerce and State departments favor the exports, the source
said.
   ``There is a deadlock between the agencies and it's going to come
up to the White House for a political decision,'' said the source,
who spoke Sunday on condition that he not be identified.
   ``Israel, Brazil and India are without question pursuing
activities related to either nuclear weapons or long-range missiles,
or both,'' the congressional source said. ``And with the facilities
which they (the supercomputers) are going to, there is ample reason
to believe there are either direct or indirect connections'' to the
weapons programs.
   At issue are applications to export a Cray Research Inc.
supercomputer to Technion, a technical university in Israel; an IBM
supercomputer for the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil; another IBM
machine for Embraer S.A., an aircraft enterprise largely owned by
the Brazilian government; and a Cray computer for the Indian
Institute of Technology in Bangalore.
   ``You have the State Department trying to smooth relations with
friendly nations, you have the Commerce Department trying to promote
exports,'' said the source, who is closely involved with nuclear
proliferation issues.
   ``On the other hand, you've got the intelligence community
concerned, No. 1, about illicit uses of those computers, and No. 2,
about possible Soviet access to some of those systems.''
   Objections to the proposed supercomputer exports were voiced at
meetings earlier this year held by the Special Nuclear Export
Committee, or SNEC, a panel of senior federal agency staff members.
   After SNEC failed to reach a consensus, the issue was referred to
a group of higher-level officials from various agencies, the Policy
Coordinating Committee, chaired by Reginald Bartholomew,
undersecretary of state for security assistance, science and
technology.
   Gary Milhollin, a professor at the University of Wisconsin Law
School and expert on the spread of nuclear weapons, said the
supercomputer dispute remains before the Policy Coordinating
Committee.
   ``They're kicking it around, but they haven't come to a
decision,'' he said. ``Cray has been lobbying very strenuously to
get these exports approved. And the Commerce Department is very
sympathetic. So it's possible the Commerce Department could
short-circuit this Policy Coordinating Committee and just decide the
case on its own.''
   Whatever course the administration takes on the supercomputer
issue, Milhollin said it will have broad implications for future
exports of other sensitive products.
   ``I think that when the United States decides what to export by
way of dual-use (military and non-military) items ... one of the
primary considerations should be the precedential effect of the
export on U.S. credibility,'' Milhollin said.
   He pointed to a recent tightening of export regulations by West
Germany after U.S. officials voiced strong concerns over the
involvement of German firms with construction of a suspected
chemical-weapons plant in Libya.
   ``When a really terrible export decision by a foreign country
comes up, we're not going to have any credibility in trying to
reverse it, if we are going to send dual-use items to countries such
as India, Israel and Brazil,'' Milhollin said.
   The nuclear proliferation expert said there currently is no
evidence that these countries would get supercomputers from Japan if
the United States refuses to supply the machines.
   ``My understanding is that the Japanese are not competing for
these sales,'' Milhollin said. ``It's conceivable that if we don't
make these sales, sometime in the future Japan could make them. But
nobody knows whether the time will ever arrive.''

   Life in the 1960s wasn't so wild for Glenn Close,
who spent five years with the well-scrubbed singing group Up With
People, the Silent Majority's answer to the Beatles.
   ``We were supposed to be the other side of Berkeley, you know,
sing some songs and the world will be a better place,'' Close, 42,
said in the September issue of Fame magazine.
   ``It was very idealistic but very controlled, very controlled. I
was absolutely sincere; it was totally naive,'' she said.
   ``I had no emotional or spiritual equipment to know what I was
doing, I was too young.''
   Close, who stars in the upcoming ``Immediate Family'' with James
Woods, said the group enabled her to travel around the world, but
she still feels she missed something in those days.
   ``I never had a '60s rebellion period. I wish that I had,'' she
said.

   Jerry Lewis is using his old movies to
reach a very special member of the younger generation _ this year's
Muscular Dystrophy Association poster child.
   Five-year-old Ashley Antolak, of Athens, met the comedian for the
first time in December in Las Vegas, shortly after being selected to
be the poster child.
   Barbara Harber, Ashley's grandmother, recalled asking Ashley
about Lewis on the girl's return from the trip. ``Granny, he's kinda
funny,'' Ashley said.
   ``Tell it to his banker,'' Mrs. Harber responded with a laugh.
   But Ashley's mother, Donna, said it was clear that Ashley didn't
know exactly who Lewis was. When Lewis found out, he decided to send
Ashley videocassettes of three movies from his cinematic heydey in
the 1960s, ``The Bellboy,'' ``Cinderfella,'' and ``The Nutty
Professor.''
   ``I figured what better way is there to bridge the gap between
our generations than through the universal language of laughter,''
Lewis said.
   So when Ashley was asked about Lewis in a recent interview, she
could say with some authority, ``He's funny.'' But is he as funny in
person as in his movies? ``No, not really,'' she said.

   ABC News' Peter Jennings, who earlier this year
earned best television anchor accolades, dropped out of high school
in the 10th grade and says that until recently he would avoid
talking about his lack of a formal education.
   In the September issue of Esquire magazine, Jennings says he read
nothing but comic books as a child and that he was an impetuous,
cocky boy used to getting his own way.
   He said he regrets not having studied literature or economics. He
said his spelling is poor and he's unfamiliar with grammar rules.
   He says when pressed on the subject of his education, he would
say he attended Carleton University in Ottawa. The truth is he
attended Carleton's night school for all of a week.
   When he sees his remarks quoted in newspapers and magazines, he
said he tells himself, ``There goes a product of no education.''
   Jennings was literally born into broadcasting. His father was the
first radio news broadcaster in Canada and later became general
supervisor of programming for the Canadian Broadcasting Company.
   Voted best news anchor by the Washington Journalism Review,
Jennings said his motivation is still largely personal.
   ``I think I still _ to a great measure _ want to impress my
father,'' he said.

   Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson, two of the most
highly praised of Britain's new generation of actors, are no longer
just co-stars. They're man and wife.
   They were married Sunday at Cliveden, a historic stately home 25
miles west of London. The half-hour service included readings from
Samuel Pepys and William Shakespeare.
   ``It was very nerve-wracking and was much worse than being on
stage _ but much more fun,'' said Branagh, who wore a suit of navy
blue linen.
   The couple met when they starred in the British Broadcasting

   Stan Brakhage, one of the most
influential filmmakers of America's avant-garde cinema, is this
year's recipient of the prestigious Edward MacDowell Medal.
   It was the first time in 30 years the medal has been given to a
filmmaker.
   Brakhage was cited for ``lifelong commitment to producing
inventive films that go beyond conventional devices of plot and
character.''
   Brakhage uses intense imagery, light and color, and fast-paced
rhythm and montage techniques. He has made more than 200 films,
ranging in length from nine seconds to four hours.
   The MacDowell Medal, named after the American composer, is
awarded to a writer, composer or visual artist for outstanding
contributions to American culture. The award is presented by the
MacDowell Colony, which was founded in 1907 and is the oldest
artist's colony in the country.

<HEAD>Yeutter Not a Household Name at White House Gym</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Clayton Yeutter may be a household name at the
Agriculture Department, but White House guards are pretty fussy
about people who don't carry identification.
   As secretary of agriculture he breezes in and out of USDA with
hardly a glance from the security guards.
   But Ron Hall of the department's Office of Information says
Yeutter was looked over carefully a while back when he tried to
enter the White House Fitness Center for an hour-long workout.
   As Hall tells it in the August issue of USDA News, a monthly
publication for employees, he accompanied Yeutter, his press
secretary Kelly Shipp, and photographer Byron Schumaker to gather
background and pictures for an article about Yeutter's physical
fitness drill.
   Three of the group flashed their USDA identification cards, but
Yeutter had grabbed his workout clothes and forgot his I.D.
   No problem. His three companions swore that Yeutter was indeed
Yeutter and that he was secretary of agriculture. Hall said the
guard ``was dubious, the secretary was bemused.''
   Finally, Hall remembered that he had an earlier issue of his
publication which showed Yeutter being sworn in by Supreme Court
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, with President Bush looking on.
   Hall showed it to the guard, who studied the photo. And studied
it some more.
   ``Uhhh, the secretary is the one in the center of the photo, with
his right hand in the air, taking the oath of office,'' Hall said.
   Finally, the guard looked up and said to Yeutter, ``Is your first
name Clayton?''
   ``Yes,'' Yeutter replied.
   ``OK, you can all go in,'' the guard said.
   Hall reported that Yeutter ran on a treadmill, pumped iron and
performed other physical feats that the 58-year-old Nebraskan uses
to blow away the tension of his job.
   Yeutter, who is 5-10{, said that having grown up on a farm he
likes meat, potatoes and gravy, as well as dessert, especially
anything chocolate.
   ``That's why I'm here working out,'' he said.
   Yeutter said his weight rose to 200 pounds before beginning to
work out at the center when he was U.S. trade representative, and he
wants to get down to 190. He's at about 195 now.

   The United States is still the leading supplier
of chicken to Japan but the margin may be narrowing a bit, says an
Agriculture Department report.
   A strong yen and growing demand among fast-food restaurants
pushed Japan's total 1988 chicken imports to a record 280,000 metric
tons, the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said.
   Imports of U.S. chicken were reported at 118,000 tons, followed
by Thailand, with 81,000 tons. Other leading providers included
Brazil, 34,000 tons, and China, 21,000 tons.
   ``Since increased domestic production is unlikely, trade sources
forecast chicken imports at 300,000 tons in 1989,'' the report said.
   But there is stiffer competition this year.
   Japan's total chicken imports in the first four months of 1989
rose about 15 percent from the same period of last year, but the
U.S. share declined sharply, the report said.
   Bryant H. Wadsworth, U.S. agricultural minister-counselor in
Tokyo, said the decline was thought to be due to reduced supplies of
bone-in chicken legs. He said U.S. bone-in leg prices didn't decline
in the early part of the year as they usually have.

   The American Bankers Association says there is
further evidence of financial recovery in the nation's farm sector:
Profits are up among agricultural banks.
   According to the association's analysis, returns on equity at the
nation's 4,357 farm banks rose to 9.7 percent in 1988 from 7.94
percent in 1987. That was the highest since 1984 but still below the
levels of the 1970s.
   Robert Dugger, chief economist for the association, said in a
recent report that farm banks ``have been successful in augmenting
and preserving a strong capital position'' despite large loan losses
and low profits in the mid-1980s.
   By contrast, he said, non-farm banks, which continue to be
affected by problems in energy related industries, experienced a
decline in returns on equity in 1988 for the fourth consecutive year.
   Returns for those banks dropped to 8.69 percent from 9.19 percent
in 1987 and 11.16 percent four years ago.
   The farm bank study was compiled from data provided by the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from 1982 through 1988 by
association economist Carlos Veintemillas and was published in the
association's Journal of Agricultural lending.

<HEAD>Root Case Draws Attention to `New Breed' of Broadcasters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mystery pilot Thomas Root, who admits making
more than $1 million helping investors get radio station licenses,
represented a ``new breed'' of broadcasters who wouldn't know hi-fi
from hamburgers, a critic says.
   These would-be station owners are the offspring of Reagan-era
deregulatory policies that made it easier to acquire a radio station
license than grab a Burger King franchise, says Andrew Schwartzman,
executive director of the Media Access Project, a Washington public
interest group.
   The new rules _ which opened the way for building hundreds of new
stations under looser regulations _ have attracted investors who
would rather buy and sell broadcasting rights than serve the public,
Schwartzman says.
   And the licenses are free.
   ``As far as they're concerned the only difference between a
Burger King franchise and a broadcast license is the one from Burger
King is not free,'' Schwartzman said in an interview Friday.
   Schwartzman said he hopes new FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes, a former
Missouri broadcaster, ``will understand ... the error of the ways of
the past commission.''
   The commission has said it is considering using lotteries for
granting station licenses in the future.
   Root, a Washington communications attorney, drew public attention
to this new-age radio business when he crashed his small plane into
the Atlantic Ocean on July 13. He had been on his way to a
deposition in Rocky Mount, N.C., on behalf of an FM station
investment group he was representing before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   Root said he passed out at the controls and his plane ran out of
gas in the Bahamas after a six-hour flight from Washington. Doctors
in Florida later discovered he had been shot in the stomach _ Root
says he doesn't know how _ and federal authorities are investigating.
   Root missed the deposition and the application was dismissed _
one of many dismissals he is alleged to have caused while
representing more than 160 FM investment groups organized by Sonrise
Management Services of Columbus, Ga.
   Sonrise later broke off its relationship with Root and brought
suit against him for allegedly failing to perform work and
double-billing.
   Sonrise's former chairman, Ralph Savage, told reporters that some
7,000 investors pumped $25 million into Sonrise operations, although
only one Sonrise-related radio station has reached the construction
phase.
   The new era of buy-and-sell resulted from several FCC actions in
the early 1980s, including new rules that opened the way for more
than 700 new FM stations nationwide, Schwartzman said.
   ``These changes have brought in a new breed of broadcaster who is
not concerned with serving the public but profiting from obtaining
and selling licenses,'' Schwartzman said.
   Licenses are granted based on an applicant's standing in the
community and financial well-being, while consideration also is
given to those with minority or female ownership.
   But the commission decided to allow stations to be sold as often
as every year, dropping the previous three-year minimum period of
ownership. Only general partners must disclose financial
information, while limited partners do not have to make such
disclosure.
   Limits were lifted on how much money one applicant can pay to buy
out another applicant's bid for the same license.
   The FCC also temporarily repealed rules requiring applicants to
prove their financial qualifications, although that requirement was
reinstated in April.
   ``The combination of these things made it possible to set up
these deals where they were confident there wouldn't be intensive
scrutiny and where they were confident that they could sell a
license as soon as it was obtained,'' Schwartzman said.
   Sonrise _ advertising itself as offering ``Management With a
Christian Ethic'' _ brought together investors who wanted into FM
radio.
   Sonrise said Root was paid $1.9 million in advance, and Root told
The Washington Post he received $1.6 million.
   The FCC is investigating Sonrise for possible abuse of commission
rules and possible criminal conduct. Hearings are planned on whether
Sonrise illegally controlled some 40 partnerships, and any
information about possible criminal violations could be turned over
to the Justice Department, said agency spokeswoman Mary Catherine
Kilday.
   Sonrise officials have denied any wrongdoing.

   Two strong earthquakes shook Ethiopia and
caused some damage in neighboring Djibouti, the U.S. Geological
Survey said Monday.
   The first quake registered 6.4 on the Richter scale and occurred
at 2:17 p.m. local time (7:17 a.m. EDT) Sunday about 320 miles
northeast of Addis Ababa and 100 miles northwest of Djibouti,
capital of the country of the same name, according to the survey's
National Earthquake Information Center.
   The second quake, registering 6.5 on the open-ended scale, took
place in the same area at 4:09 a.m. Monday (9:09 p.m. EDT Sunday),
it said.
   There were no reports immediately available from Ethiopia on
possible damage. The USGS did not elaborate on the damage in
Djibouti.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. A quake measuring 6 on the Richter scale can cause
severe damage.

   When you're the fifth great-grandson
of Thomas Jefferson and bear eerie resemblance to your famous
forebear, it's sometimes hard to remember which century you live in.
   Just ask Rob Coles.
   Coles, 36, is a living, breathing, spitting image of the man most
Americans know only from the pages of their history textbooks.
   The six-foot-two-inch, red-haired Virginian resembles Jefferson
right down to the freckles, and he has spent much of the last 10
years impersonating his illustrious ancestor in a one-man show
called ``Meet Thomas Jefferson.''
   He was hospitalized for three months earlier this year for what
he called a ``manic break,'' when he thought he really was
Jefferson. He said he takes lithium to help keep the delusion under
control.
   The similarities are remarkable.
   Coles hails from Jefferson's hometown of Charlottesville, where
he lives about four miles from the third president's Monticello
home. His lineage is impeccable: descended on his mother's side from
Jefferson's daughter Martha and on his father's side from
Jefferson's secretary, Edward Coles.
   He shares Jefferson's angular profile and speaks with the same
Virginia gentleman's accent.
   ``He's remarkably like images and descriptions of Jefferson,''
says Cinder Stanton, director of research at Monticello.
   But Coles isn't exactly like the man who penned the Declaration
of Independence.
   ``What's underneath the red hair is the big difference,'' said
Coles, who flunked out of the University of Virginia that his
forefather founded.
   ``Jefferson obviously was sort of a genius,'' he said. ``I never
did very well in school.''
   Coles said he would like to know if Jefferson shared any of his
less weighty traits.
   ``I would (like to) ask him about his college days,'' Coles said.
``How much of a rowdy he was, how much fun he had in college.''
   The other members of his family, whose resemblance to Jefferson
is limited to their ruddy hair, are little affected by their
prominent progenitor, Coles said.
   ``They're all normal people and have normal jobs.''
   Coles had never acted before he began playing Jefferson.
Depressed and looking for something to do after dropping out of
college at age 26, he took up on a professor's suggestion that he
capitalize on his resemblance to Virginia's favorite son.
   Coles' show, which he has performed around the country, includes
family stories about Jefferson that have been passed down orally
through the generations, as well as tales about Jefferson's
presidency and the years before his death.
   ``I try to emphasize just how completely alien Jefferson's
society is to our society,'' he said. ``There were only four million
people in the whole country, which is the size today of greater
Philadelphia. They're two different worlds.''
   Coles has spent enough time with his character that he sometimes
feels as if he is Jefferson.
   ``There are times you get so immersed in what you're doing you
forget what century you're in,'' he said. ``It's hard not to get
carried away with it.''
   But he says he has never thought of escaping his Jeffersonian
legacy by leaving Charlottesville or finding a different vocation.
   ``I think I'll do it for the rest of my life,'' he said. ``What
else can I do?''
   Even so, Coles admits that he sometimes gets tired of being
Jefferson.
   `It's just like anything else,'' he said. ``There are days you
wake up and you feel like Thomas Jefferson and days you want to roll
over and go back to sleep.''

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year ago, when striking miners demanded
restoration of Solidarity's legal status, the Communist government
rejected it right away. Today, not only is the independent union
legal, but one of its leaders has been nominated prime minister.
   ``I have been fighting for this for a long time, and even a few
days ago it was unrealistic,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said
after his aide, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, was picked Saturday to lead the
government.
   What was once viewed as impossible has happened in Poland.
   For seven years, people risked arrest for even showing the
Solidarity logo. Now members of parliament wear it on their lapels,
shoppers bear it on their tote bags and everyone sees it on a banner
stretched across Warsaw's main square.
   Opposition activists jailed for daring to challenge to the
government now are legislators. All three of the men President
Wojciech Jaruzelski considered for prime minister were put behind
bars by his 1981 martial-law crackdown.
   Walesa is seen daily on state television, foreign broadcasts are
not jammed and there are legal independent newspapers. Poles can
legally buy dollars and private enterprise is encouraged.
   To be sure, there is much that has not changed. There is no
reason to believe the secret police have disbanded or the tapping of
telephones has ended. Indeed, Communists remain entrenched in
positions of political and economic power. And censorship exists,
though it is much relaxed.
   Perhaps most painfully, shelves are still empty not only of the
typical trappings of 20th century life, but basic commodities. Long
lines for staples such as bread continue. And Poland, with the
world's fourth-largest foreign debt at $39 billion, has worsened
economically.
   Despite the rapid pace of change, Mazowiecki's first words after
being nominated prime minister exhorted Poles to believe in the
future.
   ``I think the most difficult task will be to make people think
that it can be better,'' he said
   The trickle-turned-flood of change could hardly have been
imagined 12 months ago, let alone in the past 45 years since
Soviet-backed communists took power in post-war Poland.
   In January 1988, government spokesman Jerzy Urban dismissed
Solidarity as a ``historical monument'' and said Walesa no longer
``represents the millions of members of the former Solidarity ...
(who) do not expect the leaders of an outdated institution to
represent them.''
   On Aug. 26, 1988, less than a week after telling strikers that
legalizing Solidarity was unrealistic, the government _ pressed by
widening labor unrest and increasingly aware it was unable to
control the economy _ offered to negotiate with Solidarity.
   Five months later, the Communist Party completed a dramatic
political about-face and opened the way for restoring legal status
to the independent movement it had spent eight years fighting.
   Walesa, though watched in the West, went virtually unmentioned in
the official Polish press, except occasionally as a private person,
a former leader of a former union or a tool of foreign powers.
   When necessary, his face was edited out of group photos.
   Only in September did he enter newspaper pages and television
screens. He remained there during the ``round-table'' talks with
communist authorities that unleashed political and trade union
reforms.
   By June, Solidarity candidates were allowed to run for all 100
seats in the newly created, freely elected Senate and 161 of the 460
seats in the lower house, or Sejm. They won all but one.
   On July 4, Walesa and Jaruzelski were photographed sitting side
by side in the parliament chambers as the first elected opposition
delegation in the East bloc in four decades took its seats.
   The changes have touched many other aspects of Polish expression.
   Until April, the government controlled all publications and the
paper they were printed on. Independent thought was published in
microscopic print on scrounged paper by underground journalists.
Deliveries were made in secret.
   Now there are legal independent daily and weekly newspapers
produced on government presses with an approved paper allocation.
   In December 1987, when five demonstrators chained themselves to a
lamp post on a Warsaw shopping street chanting ``No Freedom Without
Solidarity,'' a crowd gathered to watch the protest that took
singular courage and was likely to bring serious trouble.
   Hardly a head turned in July 1989 when a banner proclaiming
``Jaruzelski Must Go'' hung on the same street for two days.
   Only in January did Poles receive the right to keep passports at
home.
   Political activists were not allowed to travel and as recently as
March 1988, Walesa was denied a passport to attend a trade union
congress in Australia. Since December, Walesa has been to France
twice, to Italy and Belgium.
   Not only is the long-taboo World War II massacre of scores of
Polish officers at Katyn now discussed openly, but the government is
pressing the Soviet Union to accept responsibility for the crime.
   In history books, Marshal Jozef Pilsudski, a hero for
establishing Polish statehood in 1918, was officially repudiated for
saying, ``I rode the red streetcar of socialism but got off at the
stop called independence.'' Now he is officially honored.

<HEAD>University to Dispense Condoms From Snack Machines</HEAD>

   A student-led initiative aimed at safer sex
will allow University of Minnesota students this fall to buy condoms
from the same dormitory vending machines offering chocolate bars and
pretzels.
   ``I'd rather not see anyone die,'' said Joe Westrup, a university
senior and dormitory resident who helped propose the initiative.
``That's the main thing. Sex is a pretty scary thing now.''
   The university plans to stock and sell the condoms in packages of
three for a dollar in snack machines in campus residence halls and
student unions here.
   Some students say the idea will be difficult to get used to.
   ``I think AIDS is a big problem that has to be stopped, but to
sell condoms in vending machines, I think is going too far,'' said
junior Choua Vang. ``I think they should be sold in drug stores.''
   Getting condoms to students outside the walls of the campus
health service is a goal many institutions are tackling:
   _The state of Maryland distributes condoms free to University of
Maryland students and others through a ``Three For Free'' program.
   _Ohio State University is selling condoms in cigarette machines
and at bookstores. In January, it plans to phase out cigarette sales
and will switch the condom supplies to candy machines.
   _The University of Virginia sells condoms in public areas.
   ``As much as anything, I think they're a symbol that the
university cares about the students' health,'' said Jim Mitchell,
associate director of student health at the University of Virginia.
``Students make their own choices. We're saying, if you're going to
be sexually active, use condoms.''
   Mitchell said administrators expected student controversy over
the wider condom distribution on campus, but have not discovered any.
   Kathleen Matthews, director of health education at Minnesota's
Boynton Health Service, said new evidence suggests the AIDS virus is
becoming more prevalent on college campuses.
   A random national sampling of college students released last
spring showed 30 college students out of 16,861 tested positive for
the AIDS virus.
   The 0.2 percent rate alarmed researchers, said Wally Brewer,
project associate with the college health association, which
conducted the survey with the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease
Control.
   ``The incidence was cause for concern; it was higher than we
expected,'' Brewer said.
   Dormitory leaders at the University of Minnesota came up with
their proposal during the 1987-88 school year. They approached eight
university residence halls for approval before presenting the plan
to administrators.
   Westrup said students complained that it is difficult to find a
pharmacy that is conveniently located or open late at night for
impromptu condom purchases.
   Matthews said the condom vending packs also will contain
informational brochures.
   Linda Ellinger, acting vice president for student development,
said the university supports the program.
   ``We felt strongly that it was a student initiative, our students
wanted it, and there is enough evidence of the seriousness of AIDS
and its spread to warrant it,'' Ellinger said.

   Woodstock anniversary celebrants packed up
and left a muddy field here, a final reminder of the rock 'n' roll
festival 20 years ago that for many defined a generation.
   By Sunday, only about 3,500 people remained of the more than
20,000 that showed up over the last three days. The sloping alfalfa
field 110 miles northwest of New York City was soaked by rain, much
as it was in August 1969 when 400,000 attended the Woodstock Music
and Art Festival.
   Police expect most of the revelers to be gone by today.
   ``This is it,'' said Sullivan County Sheriff Joseph Wasser,
pronouncing an end to a celebration that had no official backing
from county or town authorities. Once people began arriving in large
numbers, however, the town of Bethel supplied portable toilets and
water.
   The gathering was marred when a man was stabbed in the abdomen
during a fight Saturday night.
   Joseph Basto, 39, of Newburgh, remained in critical condition
today at Harris Community General Hospital, officials said. Sullivan
County Sheriff Joseph Wasser said no arrest was made and police were
interviewing witnesses on Sunday.
   Despite that incident and a few drug-related arrests, the
anniversary like its predecessor was mostly peaceful. The first
people arrived weeks ago at the site 110 miles northwest of New York
City, which some consider hallowed ground.
   ``This isn't being cosmic or crazy, but whenever you walk on this
land when there's no people here you can feel it,'' said Will
Hoppey, one of the coordinators of the weekend's entertainment.
   ``When the wind is right and the grass is high, you can kind of
hear some of the old stuff, the groups. It's always been special,''
said Steve Bergkamp.
   Most said they were drawn by memories and the hope that some of
the original concert's performers would return. Only one did _
Melanie. She sang two songs on a makeshift stage, complementing the
entertainment provided mostly by local musicians.
   Others made it a weekend camping trip and two-day beer party.
   ``We had nothing to do for the weekend,'' said 21-year-old Evan
Lubell. ``We thought we'd get a blanket and drink some beer.''
   Cars, buses, tents, tarps and campfires dotted the hillside that
once held a mass of humanity. Medical personnel were swamped with
drug-related cases 20 years ago, but over the weekend most people
brought to a first-aid station were treated for cut feet and stubbed
toes.
   Some just had too much to drink. One man passed out face-down on
the sloping field. Someone was thoughtful enough to place a
fluorescent traffic cone next to his head.
   Some people looked as if they never left the '60s. Long hair and
beards were in the majority, and tie-dyed clothing was the uniform
of the day.
   Bergkamp, who was here in '69 and wears his silver hair to his
shoulders, tried to convince his 15-year-old son to come along.
   ``He told me, `That's corny stuff, that's old hippie stuff,'''
Bergkamp said.
   ``I said to him, `And you call me a drag!'''

<HEAD>Strike March Reaches Atlanta, Center Of Eastern's Rebuilding Effort</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Eastern workers rallied in the airline's
largest hub to try to rekindle public support for their 5{-month-old
walkout.
   The rally by about 1,000 people Sunday was part of a motorcade
that began Aug. 12 in Miami and was billed by the striking
machinists, pilots and flight attendants as ``the longest picket
line in American history.''
   The motorcade was to wind its way through various cities and end
with a Sept. 6 rally in Washington.
   The strikers said they needed to put their plight back in the
public eye and dispel the notion that Eastern's management was
successfully rebuilding the carrier.
   In recent weeks, Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent
Texas Air Corp., has won approval from creditors for a plan to
revive the airline as a smaller, more efficient carrier. Eastern,
virtually grounded at the outset of the strike in March, has
increased its flight schedule with the help of newly hired pilots
and workers who have crossed picket lines.
   Atlanta, Eastern's largest hub prior to the strike, has been at
the center of the rebuilding of the airline.
   ``Obviously, people have forgotten about us,'' said Dick Nellis,
a striking Eastern pilot from Atlanta who helped organize the
Georgia leg of the motorcade. ``We haven't done a good job in PR.
Management is much more savvy about that.
   ``We needed something like this for public awareness ... that
we're still out on strike.''
   The strikers, who have charged that Lorenzo is trying to
dismantle Eastern by selling off its assets, raised a huge hot-air
balloon bearing the banner: ``Labor Against Lorenzo.''
   They also chanted anti-Lorenzo slogans as they marched across the
parking lot outside the Atlanta Civic Center, where a flatbed truck
offered live music and series of speakers who urged the
demonstrators to stick with the strike.
   ``Lorenzo is wrong and you are right. And that's why you're going
to win'' said Democratic Rep. John Lewis, who also urged President
Bush to intervene in the strike.
   Bush, he said, ``can go to Poland and stand with the workers of
Solidarity. But you need to come home and stand with the workers of
Eastern.''
   In Washington, the leaders of the motorcade plan to present Bush
with a petition calling for the appointment of a federal trustee to
manage Eastern until the strike issues are resolved.

AP-Dow Jones, a joint venture of The Associated Press and Dow Jones

Thames. Here is his account.)

<BYLINE>By NICHOLAS HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a perfect night for a party on the river,
and an unusually warm night, which is probably what saved my life.
   I had met with some friends and boarded the Marchioness at
Charing Cross pier as guests of a friend who had chartered the boat
for his birthday party.
   I was standing outside on the bow, talking with my friends. We
had been sailing for about 20 minutes and we were laughing at
various buildings we passed, saying how awful they looked, when
suddenly there was a small jolt.
   Somebody screamed.
   The first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit
something in the river. But as I turned around I could see the
enormous, looming hull of the dredger that had hit us. It was right
on top of us.
   As I did that, somebody else yelled, ``We're going over!'' And
that's exactly what it did, in a matter of seconds.
   I was extremely lucky, as I was standing on the left-hand side of
the bow and the boat rolled to the right, and as the boat rolled I
was able to clamber over the hull and eventually found myself
standing bone-dry on top of the overturned keel.
   I was the only person I could see. Everybody else had disappeared
under the boat, including two friends I was standing with.
   I knew that my standing outside was what probably saved my life.
A colder day may have driven me below deck. Those below deck on the
dance floor must have been dragged down with the Marchioness.
   But all of a sudden I realized that the boat was rocking back up
slightly. The first thought that came to my mind was that at least
the others on board are going to be able to get out now. But I
realized it meant that I had to jump, which I did.
   I bobbed up some yards away from the boat and discovered myself
being swept along in the very strong tidal current. I realized there
was no landing point nearby. I knew I couldn't afford to go with the
flow, and decided to strike out for what appeared to be two moored
barges and a glitter of a little patch of mud across the river.
   Luckily I'm a regular swimmer. I jettisoned my glasses, decided I
didn't have time to get rid of my shoes.
   After what seemed like a very long time I finally hit what felt
like the bottom. I stood in knee-high water for the first time, and
what had been an eerie silence became the swiftly receding screams
for help of the other passengers.
   I then started shouting because I realized I couldn't get up the
riverbank wall. Two police launches passed. I screamed. One stopped
as if it had heard me, then sped off again. A man passed in a tiny
skiff and didn't hear me.
   By that stage I was fairly frantic. I'd been in the water 10 or
15 minutes and was getting cold.
   I then saw two security guards from a building across the river
running across the bridge. They finally heard my shouts or caught
sight of me.
   They lowered a ladder and pulled me out of the water.

<HEAD>Japan's National Assets the World's Largest in 1987</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan became the world's richest nation on paper in
1987, surpassing the United States in national assets for the first
time with $43.7 trillion worth of land, factories, stocks and other
wealth, a leading Japanese newspaper said today.
   The value of Japan's assets in 1987 jumped sharply from $28.3
trillion worth of assets in 1986, said Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the
country's top economic daily, quoting figures from the U.S. Federal
Reserve Board and Japan's Economic Planning Agency.
   In 1985, Japan's assets were $19.6 trillion, $11 trillion behind
those of the United States, the paper said. It said the statistics
at the end of 1987 were the latest available from the two countries.
   Officials of the Economic Planning Agency said the statistics
from Japan and the United States were issued separately toward the
end of last year, but the agency did not make any specific
comparison.
   Contributing to the rise in Japan's assets were soaring stock and
land prices, coupled with a nominal increase in the overall national
assets due to the Japanese currency's appreciation against the U.S.
dollar, the report said.
   On a yen basis, Japan's national assets rose by 17 percent in
1987 over the previous year, mainly because of increases in stock
and land prices, while the yen's value against the U.S. dollar rose
54 percent in 1987. The yen rose from about 160 yen to the dollar to
about 122 yen from the end of 1986 to the end of 1987, the report
said.
   Today, the dollar closed at 143.35 yen, down 0.17 yen from
Friday's close.
   National assets are the total value of financial assets such as
stocks and deposits and insurance, and actual assets such as
production facilities, housing, land and inventories.
   According to U.S. Federal Reserve Board figures, the United
States had $30.6 trillion in assets at the end of 1985, $34 trillion
worth in 1986 and $36.2 trillion in 1987, the newspaper said.
   It said financial assets accounted for 53 percent of Japan's
total national assets, while the value of land made up 30 percent.
   Masaru Yoshitomi, chief of the Economic Planning Agency's
Economic Research Institute, told the paper that the scale of
Japan's national assets ``shows Japan has increased its position not
only in industrial competitiveness, but also in a very important
part of the national power of financing.''
   The government reported last year Japan had record net overseas
assets of $240 trillion in 1987, making it the world's largest
creditor nation for the third year in a row.

   Sinhalese radicals detonated a landmine
under a Sri Lankan army jeep in the center of this island nation,
killing five soldiers and the civilian driver, military officials
said today.
   The bodies of six other people, five of them badly burned, were
found in the Kandy hill district, the officials added.
   All 12 deaths occurred in a 24-hour period ending at midday today.
   In the same period, government troops rounded up 645 suspected
Sinhalese radicals in a series of search operations in central and
southern Sri Lanka, the officials said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. Of these, 440 were arrested in Colombo and its suburbs.
   The military officials blamed the latest killings on the People's
Liberation Front, an ultranationalist Sinhalese group that has been
attacking the Sinhalese-dominated government the past two years. The
front accuses the government of making too many concessions to the
Tamil minority and of weakening the nation's sovereignty by allowing
Indian peacekeeping troops to remain on the island.
   However, opposition politicians and front supporters have accused
the government or government-tolerated vigilante squads of
responsibility for the charred bodies that turn up virtually every
day in the Sinhalese heartland. Senior government and military
officials also have acknowledged privately that ``excesses'' have
been committed in the government's fight against the Sinhalese
radicals.
   The attack on the army patrol occurred Sunday night in
Mahawehera, about 85 miles northeast of Colombo.
   The bodies of the six other unidentified people were found after
daybreak today in two locations in the district around Kandy, about
55 miles northeast of Colombo.
   At least 4,000 people have died in the Sinhalese violence that
started in 1987, while 11,000 more have been killed in the Tamil
insurrection that began in 1983 in northeastern Sri Lanka.
   Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
people, dominate the government and military. Tamils, who comprise
18 percent, say they are discriminated against by the ethnic
majority in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language.
   India sent peacekeeping troops to Tamil areas two years ago in an
attempt to enforce a peace accord designed to give Tamils some
autonomy.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index gained
moderately, closing at another high, while the U.S. dollar inched
down against the Japanese yen Monday.
   The dollar closed at 143.35 yen, down 0.17 yen from last Friday's

yen and 143.40 yen. It had gained a total of 1.72 yen over the
previous two trading days.
   ``Trading was thin in the absence of market-affecting
incentives,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a trader with Daiwa Bank.
   ``The majority of participants remained on the sidelines, trying
to figure out the direction of trading,'' he said.
   On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed
77.69 points, or 0.22 percent, closing at 35,140.83, a new high. On
Friday, it had declined 26.97 points.
   ``Although the market lacked a leading issue to direct trading in
a certain direction, participants bought a variety of issues,
pushing the index higher,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior dealer
with Nikko Securities.
   ``The index fluctuated nervously as participants started
arbitrage deals to make profits out of price gaps between the spot
and the futures markets,'' he said.
   A Nomura Securities dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said investors bought issues of companies expected to show good
results for the first six months of fiscal 1989.

<HEAD>Campbell Says Officials Working Toward Solution Over Remains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Smithsonian Institution failed to reach
agreement with Indian leaders on the return of Indian skeletal
remains to tribes for burial, but officials said they laid the
groundwork for a settlement.
   ``I think we're going to be able to make some progress,'' Rep.
Ben Nighthorse Campbell, D-Colo., said Sunday by telephone from his
Ignacio, Colo., ranch.
   ``We have a gentlemen's agreement to find a solution. We've
agreed on the direction of the talks, but we don't have any firm
language,'' he said.
   Campbell said he met Thursday in Albuquerque with Smithsonian
Secretary Robert McCormick Adams, Suzan Harjo, executive director of
the National Congress of American Indians, and Walter Echo-Hawk, a
lawyer for the Native American Rights Fund, to listen in on
negotiations.
   ``I think generally the agreement we're looking for is that if we
can positively identify the remains as belonging to a tribal group
or family, or if we can locate where the remains were taken from,
then the Smithsonian would be willing to return those,'' Campbell
said.
   Many of the remains are untraceable, however, he said.
   Leslie Logan of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs said
one of the sticking points is whether the institution will return
remains that were taken from certain locations but can't be traced
to a particular family or tribal group.
   The Smithsonian has an estimated 35,000 Indian skeletons and
other sacred objects, and they have long been the source of
bitterness among American Indians who liken anthropologists and
other collectors to grave robbers.
   Officials had hoped to announce an agreement on the remains
Saturday night during a reception at the Wheelwright Museum of the
American Indian in Santa Fe.
   Campbell and Ms. Logan said officials would continue to meet
during the next several weeks.
   The National Congress of American Indians estimates the bones of
2.5 million Indians are held in public and private collections
nationwide, although museum spokesmen estimate the number is closer
to 250,000.
   Campbell said he hopes an agreement with the Smithsonian will
convince other museums and universities to return some remains from
their collections.
   Ms. Logan said the Smithsonian has agreed to negotiate in part
because it is looking for support for its plans to build a national
museum for the American Indian in Washington, D.C.
   If approved by Congress, construction on the $175 million museum
would begin in 1992.
   Meanwhile, a sacred pole topped with a human scalp and said to
symbolize tribal unity was presented to the Omaha Tribe in Macy,
Neb., on Sunday after being held 101 years in a Boston museum.
   The pole, believed to more than 300 years old, was entrusted to
the Peabody Museum at Harvard University by its last keeper, Yellow
Smoke, because he doubted younger generations of Omahas would
cherish it. Tribal officials recently negotiated its return.
   ``It will take up where it left off in 1888,'' Tribal Chairman
Doran Morris said last month. ``It is a central part of our lives.
It will influence our children and grandchildren.''

   Gamal Shoeman, the attorney general, said Sunday that 11 others
suspected of belonging to the group are being sought.
   Shoeman's office issued a statement saying the organization also
plotted to overthrow the Egyptian government and establish an
Islamic regime styled on the fundamentalist government established
in Iran by the late Shiite spiritual leader Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
   ``Investigations that the prosecution carried out show that the
organization aimed at spreading Shiite thought with extremist
leanings and aimed at carrying out aggressive actions against some
American, Israeli, Saudi Arabian, Iraqi and Kuwaiti interests in
Egypt like their embassies and airlines,'' the statement said.
   It said the suspects include physicians, engineers and students.
   The statement said four Saudi Arabians and one Iranian Shiite
organized the group into cells and assigned members to military
training and indoctrination sessions in Iran, Cyprus, India and
Syria.
   It said the five provided thousands of dollars for the
organization that was created in 1985.
   It did not say if members of the group had attempted any attacks,
but said explosives, hand grenades and other arms were found in
posession of the suspects.
   Egypt in May 1987 expelled Iran's only two diplomats serving in
Cairo, accusing them of having links with Moslem extremists opposed
to President Hosni Mubarak.
   Most Egyptian Moslems are members of the larger Sunni faction.
Iran is predominantly Shiite.

   U.S. Army investigators are searching for
an interpreter assigned to a Soviet missile inspection team who
disappeared earlier this month, a military spokesman said.
   Staff Sgt. Rasa M. Vasyliunas, an interpreter with the U.S.
On-Site Inspection Agency, called in sick for work Aug. 4 and has
not been seen since, Maj. Bill Auer, a spokesman for the 96th Army
Reserve Command and Fort Douglas said Sunday.
   The inspection agency was created in 1988 to monitor Soviet
arms-control inspectors in the United States, including those
stationed at the suburban Hercules Inc. plant.
   Auer said a display of Ms. Vasyliunas's photograph in the news
media had prompted tips to the Army Provost Marshal's office, but
none had proven solid.
   Vasyliunas, 48, has been with the OSIA for about a year. She
speaks German, Russian, Lithuanian and English.

   Christian army commander Gen. Michel Aoun
was quoted today as saying he was willing to hold a round table
conference with Moslem leaders to determine Lebanon's future
government.
   ``I am ready any time to discuss Lebanon's future at a round
table with leaders of the other side,'' Aoun said in an interview
published by the Paris-based Arabic magazine Koll el-Arab.
   He made no mention of his previous condition that any
Christian-Moslem negotiations on political reforms should be
preceded by the withdrawal of the Syrian army from Lebanon.
   Aoun's remark was broadcast by Christian and Moslem radio
stations as his 20,000 mainly Christian troops traded sporadic
artillery and tank fire across Beirut's dividing Green Line and in
hills above the capital.
   No casualties were reported. By police count, 784 people were
killed and 2,126 wounded since Aoun's confrontation with the Syrians
broke out March 8.
   Police said Syrian gunners in Moslem west Beirut and in north
Lebanon pounded the coast of the Christian port of Byblos with 100
shells and rockets overnight to turn back three ships carrying food
to the beleaguered Christian enclave.
   The splinter Moslem army command issued a communique today
claiming its gunners scored hits on all three ships and ``prevented
them from unloading arms and ammunition.''
   But sources at Aoun's command ridiculed the claim, saying Moslem
army units in west Beirut do not possess the long-range guns needed
to hit Byblos, 20 miles north of Beirut.
   The poorly equipped Moslem troops of the army _ estimated at
22,000 _ are largely scattered in remote areas in north, east and
south Lebanon with only about 4,000 in west Beirut. They have played
no active role in the Syrian-Christian confrontation.
   The Syrians, who maintain 40,000 troops in Lebanon under a 1976
peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League, are bent on preventing
arms supplies from reaching the blockaded enclave, home to 1 million
Christians.
   Beirut media reports said today that the dispatch of French
warships to the eastern Mediterranean was aimed at breaking the
Syrian siege.
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar quoted unidentified sources as
saying the French flotilla would run the gauntlet of Syrian
shellfire and ensure the arrival of arms and fuel supplies to the
enclave.
   France has dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch and destroyer
Duquesne to take positions off Lebanon's coast along with a navy
hospital ship and fuel tanker for the declared purpose of evacuating
7,000 French passport holders from Lebanon if the fighting worsened.
   ``France is just giving a humanitarian excuse for its upcoming
military intervention,'' An-Nahar quoted an unidentified
``high-ranking source'' in Beirut as saying.
   The French naval moves provoked a Moslem uproar. Hezbollah, or
Party of God, Iran's main Shiite Moslem ally in Lebanon, has
threatened anti-French suicide bombings.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, whose 6,000-strong militia is
backing the Syrian army, warned that a French intervention would
hurt Christian minorities throughout the Middle East.
   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, an underground group
holding two American hostages, warned in a statement released Sunday
night that their lives would be in peril if the French navy
intervened in Lebanon.
   ``America, which is spurring France on, should realize that any
foolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of its
hostages to danger,'' the statement said.
   The group holds Joseph Cicippio, 58, acting comptroller of the
American University of Beirut who was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, and
self-styled writer Edward Austin Tracy, 58, who was abducted Oct. 21
the same year.
   In Sidon, provincial capital of south Lebanon, a freighter that
has been smuggling food supplies and vegetables to the Christian
enclave, was blown up by three bombs at the city's harbor at dawn
today, police said.
   The vessel sank but its seven-man Lebanese crew swam to shore
unharmed, according to a police spokesman.
   This was the fourth freighter to be blown up in Sidon for
smuggling food to the Christian enclave. Three were wrecked by
similar explosions in June.

<HEAD>Savage Calls for Black Boycott of Media</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rep. Gus Savage, accused of sexually harassing a
Peace Corps volunteer in Africa, says the incident was
misrepresented by the white-owned media and urged blacks to boycott
local newspapers and television stations.
   Savage, 63, called Saturday for a black boycott of the Chicago
Tribune, the Sun-Times, most local television stations and their
advertisers.
   Joined by some black community leaders including Alderman Dorothy
Tillman, Savage spoke to about 300 people who crowded into the
Progressive Community Church in his predominantly black South Side
district.
   In an hour-long speech, he urged blacks to wage ``war on the
white-owned media.
   ``This meeting is about how to get respect from that white press.
We're going to teach them just a little R-E-S-P-E-C-T,'' he said.
   A flyer distributed at the event urged a boycott of WBBM-TV news,
the Tribune and the Sun-Times, calling them ``the most notorious
violators of fair media coverage of the black community.''
   Officials at the television station and the newspapers declined
to comment.
   Savage, himself a former publisher and broadcaster, defended his
conduct on a trip to Zaire in March, when he is accused of having
fondled a 28-year-old Peace Corps volunteer. The House ethics
committee is investigating the incident, and the State Department is
looking into Savage's conduct on that trip and at least one other he
made abroad.
   ``I've had my share of women, and I've never had to hit too
hard,'' Savage said. ``They're making all this noise that some grown
black man hit on a grown black woman ... too hard.''
   The five-term congressman has frequently rebuffed unfavorable
news accounts and criticism by saying they were racially motivated.
He has been able to win re-election easily in the district, which
contains some of the nation's most impoverished neighborhoods.

<HEAD>Friends Mark 40th Anniverary of First Black's Graduation From Naval
Academy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND BEACH, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forty years ago, Wesley Brown became
the first black man to throw his hat into the air at a U.S. Naval
Academy graduation.
   His breakthrough didn't go unnoticed. Some people sent him hate
mail. But he also received 15 marriage proposals.
   On Saturday, nearly 200 friends and family members honored Brown
at Highland Beach, not far from where he won a personal and historic
battle over racism. Letters of commendation, including one from an
old classmate and former President, Jimmy Carter, were read aloud.
   ``The academy was 100 years old,'' Brown, now 62, said. ``I
thought it was time.''
   When Brown arrived at the academy in Annapolis in 1945, he was
the sixth black to enroll. None of the others had made it past the
first year, though.
   The first year was ``tough,'' he said. In his first semester, he
received 140 demerits, 10 fewer than the limit before dismissal.
   ``I didn't know if I got demerits because I was black or because
I was a plebe,'' said Brown, now a retired lieutenant commander with
20 years of naval service behind him. ``There are some times I got
demerits I thought I didn't deserve.''
   He said he was not always treated unfairly. Someone once took
apart his bedding to try to get him in trouble, but the duty officer
refused to punish him for it.
   Still, Brown roomed alone all four years. When he sat down next
to classmates, they often stood up and left. Some refused to speak
to him.
   ``I didn't mind it so much,'' Brown said. ``I had a goal. I liked
the Navy. I liked the Naval Academy.
   ``I thought all the teachers and professors I had were certainly
very fair,'' he said, ``and for the most part I got along with my
classmates.''
   Ensign Dondi Edwards, 22, one of about 20 blacks who graduated
this year, said Brown was ``a modern-day hero. Without him there
would have been no beginning for blacks at the Naval Academy.''
   ``Where he stood 40 years ago, now there are 237 (black)
midshipmen,'' Edwards said. There are about 4,500 students overall
at the academy.
   Brown's wife, Crystal, who blazed a trail of her own as one of
only two black undergraduates at the University of Vermont, said she
never doubted her husband would succeed.
   ``These are things you did, you were expected at that time to
achieve,'' she said. ``We are all trailblazers. Today we are called
minorities. I never thought I was a minority. I thought I was me.
That's how he is.''

<HEAD>Pope's World Youth Rally a Long Way from Woodstock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>OVIEDO, Spain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There were mobs of teen-agers, pounding
music and not enough toilets, but Pope John Paul II's World Youth
Day was far from your usual rock concert.
   The celebration _ which actually lasted most of the weekend _ was
intended as the highlight of a three-day papal visit to Spain that
ends today with Mass at a mountain shrine in the northern town of
Covadonga.
   On Sunday, the pontiff made his second call in five days for an
end to 14 years of sectarian fighting in Lebanon. He appeared to
refer to Syrian soldiers and Moslem militias when he said: ``It
seems that the intention is to destroy the city of Beirut, and in
particular, the zones inhabited by Christians.''
   His comments came at the end of a Mass at the Vatican-sponsored
4th World Youth Day celebrations near Santiago de Compostela.
Thousands of the estimated 400,000 participants from 55 countries
signed an appeal for peace in Lebanon that was to be sent to the
United Nations.
   The pope on Sunday also visited a cathedral in the northern
mining center of Oviedo and spoke at a Mass at a field outside the
city.
   World Youth Day marked one of the Roman Catholic Church's most
spectacular efforts ever to reach young people, featuring a
glittering show with long-haired rock singers and an audience in
blue jeans that clapped and danced. Most eventually camped out on
big rectangles of plastic covering the orange clay of Gozo Mountain.
   One participant from Chicago, 24-year-old John Kurt, noted that
Americans marked the 20th anniversary of the Woodstock concert in
the same week as the huge papal gathering at an ancient pilgrim site.
   ``People are going from dope to pope,'' he quipped.
   Indeed, many of those at the fourth World Youth Day celebrations
came for one reason: to see John Paul.
   ``He gives us such happiness, it's incredible,'' remarked Ramon
Verra, 16, of Mexico City.
   In his far-flung travels, the 69-year-old pope tries to use the
force of his personality to convince young people of the importance
of Catholic values _ especially such unpopular ones as chastity.
   But John Paul had nothing less in mind this weekend than
inspiring a ``new Christianization'' for Catholicism's third
milennium and its estimated 860 million followers worldwide.
   He reflected the church's increasing emphasis on young people as
protagonists in an effort to turn back secularization. John Paul
urged young people to hold Christian values rather than seeking
economic success, power or sexual gratification.
   The pope's message seemed popular with the crowd at Gozo
Mountain, which ranged from parish groups to conservative
political-religious organizations to students trying to strengthen
their religion.
   ``He tells it like it is,'' said Mary Sheehan, 23, of Washington.
   Vatican officials were trying to contact Lebanese leaders to
press John Paul's peace effort, but there were no announcements
Sunday about the pope's earlier offer to visit Lebanon.
   More than 750 people have been killed since fighting broke out
between the Syrian-led fighters and Christian troops in March.
   The pontiff's trip is his third to Spain and the 43rd foreign
voyage of his 11-year papacy.

<HEAD>Deng's Selected Writings Splashed Across Chinese Newspapers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bold-faced newspaper headlines today trumpeted the
publication of new writings by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, adding
to the aging leader's growing prominence since the crackdown on the
spring democracy movement.
   The half-page article on the front-pages of China's major
newspapers was accompanied by a photo of Deng, who turns 85 on
Tuesday and is reported to be seriously ill.
   The photo taken July 2 is the newest available of Deng, said
officials of the government-run Xinhua News Agency, which released
the picture. Deng was last seen publicly on June 9 talking to
martial law troops in Beijing.
   The photo shows Deng, seated in an armchair, gesturing and
speaking, but does not show where he is or who he is talking with.
   The new volume of Deng's writings from 1938-1965 includes 30
previously unpublished articles and is one of two new publications
of his works since he ordered troops to crack down on student
protestors in Beijing on June 3-4, killing hundreds, perhaps
thousands, of people.
   The other book, ``Twenty-Eight Years of Deng Xiaoping,'' details
his life during the same period.
   Xinhua said it is about ``Deng's great courage, foresight, and
sagacity'' and describes ``Deng's brilliant contributions and
exceptional services to the revolution.''
   The two books are part of an emerging personality cult
surrounding a man who once condemned such adulation because of the
political extremism during revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung's later
years.
   Chinese throughout the country have been ordered to study his
June speech to the martial law troops. The official press has given
prominent play to Deng's writings and speeches, including a
previously unpublished 1956 speech on suiting Marxism and Leninism
to China printed in major papers last week.
   This month, movie theaters throughout the country began showing a
film on how the 25-year-old Deng led communist forces in
southeastern China. It is the first Chinese movie solely about Deng.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The season's fifth tropical storm was churning along
over the open Atlantic today, posing no threat to land, forecasters
said.
   ``This is the kind we like, out in the middle of the Atlantic,
not affecting land,'' forecaster Max Mayfield of the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Tropical Storm Erin's center was located about
1,350 miles southwest of the Azores island chain, near 23.0 north
latitude and 41.8 west longitude.
   It would be very unusual for Erin to make landfall in the United
States from its present position, Mayfield said.
   The storm packed winds of 45 mph and was moving northwest at 15
to 20 mph. Erin's forward motion was expected to slow as its wind
speed increases during the next 12 to 24 hours, forecasters said.
   Erin became the season's fifth tropical storm late Sunday when
its sustained winds reached 39 mph. Hurricanes have sustained winds
of 74 mph or greater. There have been two hurricanes so far this
season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   A prominent Vietnamese author who was
seriously wounded by shots fired from a car as he walked near his
home had claimed that that anti-communists had threatened to kill
him.
   The wounding of Doan Van Toai was the latest in a number of
attacks in California in recent years against Vietnamese refugees
who advocate that the United States establish diplomatic relations
with Vietnam.
   Toai, 42, was shot Saturday morning four times in the head and
upper body by two men in a car, said Sheriff's Sgt. Oliver Moon.
   Toai was moved to an undisclosed location. Moon said his
condition was serious.
   He co-authored ``The Vietnamese Gulag'' and ``Portrait of the
Enemy'' with writer David Chanoff and is executive director of the
Institute for Democracy in Vietnam.
   In a 1986 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Toai said he
received threats after writing an article four years earlier
alleging that an anti-communist group was using funds fraudulently.
   In 1986, a former Saigon housing official, Tran Khanh Van, was
shot in Orange County's Little Saigon after saying he supported
relations with Vietnam. His assailant pleaded guilty and was
convicted. Author Long Vu suffered partial paralysis after a severe
beating in the same Westminster refugee community on April 30, 1988.
   Last January, an arson fire destroyed a Garden Grove travel
agency specializing in Vietnam tours. No suspects have been arrested
in that incident or the beating of Long Vu.
   Some Vietnamese activists believe Toai was shot by
anti-communists angered by his proposal that the United States open
relations with Vietnam, the writer had enemies on the other end of
the political spectrum, said Dam Phuong Tran, president of the
Vietnamese Committee for Human Rights in Washington.
   But he said the writer had enemies on the other end of the
political spectrum, and added that it was possible he was shot by
communist agents.
   Toai came to the United States as a refugee in 1978 after he was
released from a re-education camp in Vietnam, Tran said.
   ``A lot of Vietnamese accuse him of being a communist agent,''
Tran said. ``I think of him as a Vietnamese who tried to do
something good for the people of Vietnam and for the good of the
country itself. That doesn't mean he agreed with the present
political situation in Vietnam.''
   The writer was shot by two men described as Asian and driving a
station wagon, Moon said. Sheriff's investigators have not been able
to talk to Toai because of his condition, he added.

<HEAD>Hostages Can be Used to Prevent Intervention in Lebanon: Iran Daily</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Iranian newspaper saying kidnappers
can prevent foreign intervention, details. No pickup.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Iranian daily said today that holding
Western hostages can be used as a way to prevent foreign
intervention in Lebanon, according to Iran's official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
   The report came a day after a pro-Iranian group holding Joseph
Cicippio and another American threatened to kill the hostages if the
French navy intervenes in Lebanon.
   ``To prevent foreign intervention, a lever in the hands of
Lebanon's Moslem combatants was the susceptibility of Western
governments vis-a-vis the hostage issue,'' the Abrar newspaper said
in an editorial.
   The pro-government daily assured the Lebanese Moslems that their
``struggle'' would culminate in the establishment of a state based
on ``their will as the country's majority,'' according to IRNA,
monitored in Nicosia.
   The pro-Iranian kidnappers of 16 Western hostages held in Lebanon
are Shiite Moslems _ Lebanon's largest single sect _ seeking to
create an Iranian-style Islamic republic to replace the
Christian-dominated system.
   Iran has denied it has any direct control over the fate of the
hostages.
   Urging the West against involvement in Lebanon's politics, Abrar
referred to the 1983 attacks by Shiite zealots against the French
and American military units in Beirut, which killed nearly 300
troops and led to the withdrawal of the multinational peacekeeping
force from Lebanon a few months later.
   IRNA said the Iranian newspaper described the withdrawal of the
peacekeepers from Lebanon as the ``escape of the American and French
forces.''
   On Sunday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization threatened to
kill Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy if there is intervention by
France, which dispatched two warships to the eastern Mediterranean
reportedly to evacuate 7,000 French nationals from war-battered
Lebanon if the need arises.
   ``America, which is spurring France, should realize that any
foolhardiness by the French fleet will expose the life of its
hostages to danger,'' the Shiite Moslem group said in a statement.
   The handwritten message in Arabic, delivered to the independent
newspaper An-Nahar and a Western news agency in Beirut, was
accompanied by a photocopy of a photograph of Tracy the group
released Aug. 1.
   The group recently threatened to kill Cicippio unless Israel
released kidnapped Shiite cleric Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, but the
group later suspended its threat.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France said Sunday that his
nation's forces had no intention of intervening in Lebanon.
   Moslem leaders, including the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, have said France may be preparing for a military intervention
to help Christian forces who are fighting with the Syrian army and
its Moslem allies.
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for Shiite
extremist factions holding most of the Western hostages in Lebanon,
including eight Americans. The longest-held hostage is Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.

<TEXT>
   Publisher Malcolm Forbes was proclaimed
an honorary citizen of Tangier as his extravagant 70th birthday bash
drew to a close after a Moroccan feast, seaside fireworks and
nightlong dancing.
   Many of the nearly 1,000 guests, who included some of the top
names in business, industry, entertainment and the arts, rose late
on Sunday, just in time to attend a luncheon offered in their honor
by King Hassan II.
   The king didn't appear at the Saturday night party or at lunch,
but Tangier Gov. Mohamed Laalaj was on hand Sunday to proclaim
Forbes an honorary citizen.
   Most guests were flying home later in the day, having come for
the weekend on three jets provided by Forbes to bring guests from
New York to his Chateau Mendoub overlooking the Strait of Gibraltar.
   The royal luncheon was held at Tangiers Country Club, where
guests watched a display of horsemanship by some of Morocco's top
riders, who fired ancient rifles into the air while riding at top
speed.
   Traditional dancers and musicians were also on hand, as guests
arrived by the bus load at the country club to be served mint tea
from silver teapots.
   The king's sons, Crown Prince Mohamed and his brother Rachid,
were in the receiving line at the country club.
   A smiling Forbes was accompanied by actress Elizabeth Taylor, his
frequent companion since his 39-year marriage ended in divorce in
1985.
   Forbes' four sons _ Malcolm Jr., Christopher, Robert and Timothy
_ and his married daughter Moira Mumma, gave the party for their
father, but Forbes added teasingly, ``I'm paying for it.''
   The guest list featured the rich and famous. It included
billionaire Donald Trump, Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli, opera
singer Beverly Sills, television personalities Walter Cronkite and
Barbara Walters, Spanish singer Julio Iglesias, publishers Katharine
Graham, Rupert Murdoch and Robert Maxwell, former Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger, former Kings Constantine of Greece and Simeon of
Bulgaria.
   They were feasted in Moroccan-style tents to pigeon pie, lamb
mechoui and chicken tadjine. Chief caterer Abdelkrim Tinsamani said
the food cost $750,000, with everything but the whisky and gin
obtained locally.
   There were a few snags.
   The music failed to come in on cue to Ms. Sills' rendering of
``Happy Birthday.'' Many of the guests complained there was no air
conditioning in their hotel and that their hair dryers could not be
plugged in.
   Some Tangier residents questioned the wisdom of such a lavish
display of wealth in a city where many live in poverty.
   But Forbes was unfazed by the criticism. ``I don't feel guilty
about it,'' he said. ``I'm grateful that we can do it.''
   Most guests seemed to agree.
   ``The greatest party I've ever been to,'' said Keith R. Garrity,
chairman of Fansteel Inc., based in Chicago.

<HEAD>Japanese Electronics Giant JVC to Launch New Hollywood Film Company</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 7th graf, `Australia's Qintex...', to restore dropped dollar

<TEXT>
   Joining a growing list of foreign companies
seeking a slice of the Hollywood pie, Japan's JVC announced that it
will invest more than $100 million in a new motion-picture
production company.
   The joint venture, Largo Entertainment, will be headed and
co-owned by Lawrence Gordon, the former president of 20th Century
Fox who oversaw such films as ``Cocoon,'' ``Jewel of the Nile,''
``Commando,'' ``Aliens'' and ``The Fly,'' it was announced Sunday.
   The company will develop and produce up to eight studio-budget
movies a year, Gordon said. Films will be distributed to U.S.
theaters by one of the existing major studios.
   ``I want to make films that will play throughout the world,''
Gordon said. ``Most things that play well here will play well
overseas.''
   Largo represents the first major move by a leading Japanese
company in the production of high-budget Hollywood movies. But JVC's
gambit is just one in a series of Hollywood purchases made by
overseas players.
   Entertainment is one of the nation's largest exports, with a net
positive trade balance of about $5 billion annually. Sparked by such
rosy financial health, the deregulation of European television and
booming foreign electronic sales, foreign players have been flocking
to Hollywood.
   Australia's Qintex Group bought MGM-UA for $1 billion earlier
this year, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. already owns Fox. British
broadcaster Television South PLC bought TV producer MTM a year ago
for $310 million. Italian investors Giancarlo Parretti and Florio
Fiorini control the struggling Cannon Group.
   There has been speculation for months that Sony Corp. was set to
purchase a Hollywood studio. The Japanese communications giant's
involvement in film production is limited to SVS Films, a small
producer of low-budget movies.
   JVC is the U.S. arm of Victor Co. of Japan Ltd. Japan's
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., which makes Panasonic and
Technics products, owns 50.8 percent of Victor.
   Victor will operate Largo through a new subsidiary, JVC
Entertainment Inc.
   ``We are pleased to be introduced to American film making through
the eyes and ears of Mr. Gordon,'' JVC Chairman Seiichiro Niwa said
in a statement. ``He is a man whose vision and experience are fully
compatible with our goals and needs.''
   Gordon said in an interview that Largo would open its doors today
at Gordon's small office on the Fox studio lot. He said he would
begin to fill staff positions this week and the company's first
movie should be in theaters by late 1990.
   Gordon refused to specify how much JVC's initial investment would
be, saying only that it will be ``well in excess of $100 million.''
He said JVC also will make additional capital infusions in coming
months.
   At peak operation, Largo plans to make five to eight movies a
year, with budgets mirroring those of the major studios, about $20
million a picture.
   Steve Rosenberg, president of the entertainment consulting firm
Rose Media, said he was not impressed with the JVC deal. He said
smart foreign investors buy operational studios.
   ``There's no magic in Japanese money,'' Rosenberg said. ``With
this new company, JVC will face the same problems of the Cannon
Group or (now-bankrupt studio) De Laurentiis. They're still an
independent producer. That's all they are.''
   Gordon, who served as president of Fox from 1984 to 1986, served
as executive producer of such films as ``Field of Dreams'' ``Die
Hard,'' and the new Sylvester Stallone movie ``Lock Up.''
   JVC is perhaps best known in the United States for creating the
VHS videocassette format, now the industry standard. In addition to
manufacturing audio, video and television hardware, JVC also is a
leader in Japan's home video and record business.
   Total JVC group revenues for 1988 were $6.2 billion.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Mayor Files Complaint Over Killing of Palestinian</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EILEEN ALT POWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said today he has
filed a complaint with Israeli authorities over the alleged killing
of a Palestinian in the city by security officers disguised as
tourists.
   Freij said in a telephone interview that the shooting incident
Saturday allegedly involving disguised officers ``is a very serious
incident, and I think the government is required to give an
explanation.''
   The action, he said, could have a chilling effect on tourism in
the Holy Land, which already has been badly affected by the 20-month
uprising.
   There were conflicting reports on the incident in Bethlehem's
central market, near the Church of the Nativity that marks the
traditional location of Jesus' birth.
   Freij said Bethlehem residents who witnessed the incident said
two men and two women, wearing backpacks and carrying cameras,
opened fire on demonstrators in the market, killing Radi Mahmoud
Salah, 18.
   An army spokesman said soldiers opened fire after they were
attacked with stones, and that four Palestinians were wounded.
   The spokesman, who cannot be identified under military rules,
said the army was unable to locate any body or to confirm reports
that a Palestinian had died.
   A spokeswoman declined comment on the allegation that security
forces posed as tourists.
   Doctors at King David Hospital in Bethlehem said Salah was
fatally shot in the chest.
   ``As Arabs, we welcome tourists,'' Freij said. ``It is our
national duty to provide them with the best services. But when
elements with guns try to disguise themelves as tourists and kill
people, it could create suspicion among the Arab community over who
is a genuine tourist.''
   At least 540 Palestinians have been shot and killed by Israelis
since the start of the uprising against Israeli rule. Ninety-seven
Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis also
have died.
   Freij noted Israeli security forces have disguised themselves in
the past, in some cases by putting press signs on their cars, but
that this was the first reported incident in which they pretended to
be tourists.
   Also today, both the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip
were shut down by a general strike called to protest an arson
attempt on Jersalem's Al Aqsa Mosque two decades ago. Hospital
officials said troops wounded three Palestinian children in a clash
on the West Bank.
   Shops and schools were closed, and public and private
transportation ground to a halt, according to Arab reports.
   Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third-holiest site, was set ablaze Aug.
21, 1969, by a Christian fundamentalist from Australia who later was
judged insane and deported to Australia. Experts have spent years
restoring the shrine, and the work is still incomplete.
   Clashes erupted today between soldiers and stone-throwing
Palestinians in the Tulkarem refugee camp, and three children
suffered gunshot wounds, Arab hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Eds: Top 18 grafs new with new Thornburgh and Biden quotes; picks

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said the
United States should consider offering military help to the
Colombian government in its fight against drug terrorism, but the
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee opposed the use of troops.
   ``I think we have to look at any request that we get for either
law enforcement or military assistance seriously,'' Thornburgh said
Sunday on NBC-TV's ``Meet The Press.''
   ``You now see an aura of terrorism rather than simply
narco-trafficking,'' he said. ``The assassination of a presidential
candidate, of the chief of police in Medellin, of other judges and
top officials have really brought that country to its knees as far
as enforcing its own laws'' is concerned.
   ``I don't think we ought to respond, as some suggest, willy-nilly
with a military response,'' Thornburgh said. ``But I do think that's
an option that we have to keep open.''
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said today he would support sending some type of American police
force to assist in Colombia, but he would draw the line at sending
in U.S. troops.
   ``There should be absolutely no safe haven for these
narco-terrorists, and we know where they are most of the time,''
Biden said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
   ``The idea of sending down Marines en masse to invade Colombia at
the invitation of the Colombian government I cannot see,'' Biden
said. ``The idea of sending down, if you will, the international
version of SWAT teams to help train and be part of operations to try
to arrest, to spirit these people away and bring them back to the
United States for trial, I can see.''
   The comments by Thornburgh and Biden followed a statement
Saturday by President Bush that he was ready to meet with Colombian
President Virgilio Barco ``at the earliest convenient moment to
consider a coordinated approach'' to the drug problem.
   Barco said Friday he was using emergency powers to reinstate an
extradition treaty with the United States so that Colombian drug
traffickers may be tried on drug charges originating in this country.
   Barco issued the order after Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, a leading
presidential candidate, was killed in a shotgun attack that police
blamed on drug lords. At least 10 other people were wounded in the
attack.
   The latest violence, which also included the killing of a
provincial police chief Friday, also led to the arrest of nearly
10,000 suspected drug criminals Sunday in Colombia.
   ``The numbers of the major kingpins we're looking at (for
extradition) are a dozen or so,'' Thornburgh said Sunday.
   ``If in Colombia they feel, hypothetically, that they may have
reached the point where they can no longer operate under the rule of
law and have to use the rule of force, then they're going to require
all the help they need,'' Thornburgh said.
   ``We've begun discussions with the State Department and with the
United States attorneys who are handling these particular cases so
we will be in a position to act when any one or more, we hope, of
these major cartel traffickers are taken into custody in Colombia,''
he said.
   In another television interview today, Thornburgh said Bush's
drug strategy, scheduled to be announced Sept. 5, ``will be directed
to making the user of drugs far more accountable than we have in the
past.''
   ``Every cocaine sniffer or crack smoker in this country bears
some responsibility for the assassinations that took place in
Colombia, just as they bear responsibility for the crossfire that
occurs in our streets here in the United States,'' the attorney
general said on ``CBS This Morning.''
   ``Without the demand for drugs here in the United States, there
would be no drug traffickers, there would be no violence, there
would be no concern that has now become worldwide.''
   Thornburgh also contended on ``Meet the Press'' that federal
investigators have the right to examine the telephone records of
reporters in an effort to find the source of leaked information from
government sources.
   Thornburgh said investigators would be ``well within
constitutional bounds'' if they sought reporters' telephone records.
   However, he added, ``I'm not going to comment on any particulars
of any investigation.''
   Thornburgh has ordered an investigation into leaks surrounding
U.S. Rep. William Gray, D-Pa., shortly before he was elected House
Democratic whip. Gray was interviewed by FBI agents on Memorial Day,
triggering reports he was under investigation.
   The Justice Department later said Gray was not the subject of an
investigation.

   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak today
told African leaders beginning a four-day summit that the two main
guerrilla-backed groups in South Africa should unite in their effort
to end white rule.
   Mubarak, chairman of the Organization of African Unity,
challenged the guerrilla-backed African National Congress and the
rival Pan Africanist Congress of South Africa to become one
liberation organization.
   ``We stand ready to bring together both organizations in
conditions acceptable to their leaders,'' he told the OAU's ad hoc
Committee on Southern Africa.
   Western diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Mubarak was seeking agreement on a common African policy toward
South Africa, possibly modifying some radical demands by the
liberation movements as preconditions for talks with the Pretoria
government.
   Today's summit was scheduled to discuss proposals for a new
approach to South Africa's racial policies from the two movements,
but no details of the written proposals have been released.
   Seven heads of state of the 13 African leaders normally
represented on the committee attended the opening session in Harare.
   Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe said the leaders of South
Africa's voteless black majority were ready to engage in serious
negotiations with the white-dominated government.
   But ``they and the people of free Africa must be convinced that
the regime is serious about wanting to negotiate,'' Mugabe said.
   Mugabe said mediation efforts to end conflicts in the
black-governed former Portuguese colonies of Angola and Mozambique
had made positive progress.
   But because of ``very difficult and delicate conditions'' these
initiatives needed more backing from the 50-member OAU and other
world nations, the Zimbabwean leader said.
   The African National Congress, the main guerrilla organization
fighting in South Africa, has in the past resisted calls for it to
merge with the Pan Africanist Congress to end long standing
antagonism between the two groups.
   Both groups use armed resistance against the white-led
government. However, the Pan Africanist Congress favors black
self-reliance in the struggle for political rights, while the ANC
supports a multiracial approach.
   Speaking for South African liberation movements, President
Zephania Mothopeng of the Pan Africanist Congress said limited
dialogue so far between South Africa's 26 million blacks and 6
million whites who hold political power led only to ``cosmetic''
changes to apartheid.
   ``At present, that type of negotiation is out,'' he said.
   The summit also was expected to consider a proposed U.N.
resolution setting a framework for a South African settlement
initiative along the lines that guided U.N.-supervised independence
elections in Namibia scheduled for November.
   Some OAU leaders are opposed to that idea, believing it would
minimize Africa's role in any settlement plan, diplomats said.
   The 16-member ad hoc committee, chaired by Mubarak, comprises
Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mali,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the African
National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and the South-West
Africa People's Organization of Namibia.
   On Tuesday, the eight-nation special peace committee on Angola
will review efforts toward peace in that territory.
   A summit of heads of five Portuguese-speaking African states
convenes on Wednesday and the leaders of a nine-nation economic
grouping of Southern African nations meets Thursday in Harare.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa today
discussed the West's role in shoring up Poland's economy with four
U.S. senators at national union headquarters in this Baltic port
city.
   ``We who have been here will go back and see what we can do,
because this is important for Poland and the world,'' said Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., after the meeting.
   Walesa has repeatedly called on the West to help Poland reverse
its economic decline, but today he stopped short of asking for a
massive aid program, said Sen. Robert Graham, D-Fla.
   During the meeting, Walesa asked for help in restructuring
Poland's $39 billion foreign debt, setting up independent banks and
bringing U.S. businesses into joint ventures, Graham said.
   ``He was not asking for a Marshall Plan for Poland,'' Graham
said, referring to the huge U.S. aid plan that helped put Western
Europe back on its feet after World War II.
   Poland's Communist leadership, which earlier this year held its
first contested elections since shortly after the war, has now
nominated Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a Solidarity activist, as prime
minister. He would be the first non-Communist to lead an East bloc
government since the Communists consolidated control of Eastern
Europe after World War II.
   Asked before the meeting if he now expected major help from the
West, Walesa replied. ``No, it is not time yet for the West. First
comes the formation of the government, then its first movements _
wise movements _ and then it will be the time,'' he said.
   However, he added, ``We ourselves did so much more than the West
expected. So in that case, we can expect more from the West, too.
That is obvious.''
   The group of Democratic senators, which also included Charles
Robb of Virginia and Paul Sarbanes of Maryland, wound up its
four-day visit to Poland in Gdansk. They then headed on to Budapest,
Hungary, another center of East bloc reforms.
   During their Polish visit, they also met with President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who nominated Mazowiecki as prime minister.

   An unusual buildup of Israeli troops and
allied militiamen in south Lebanon today prompted U.N. peacekeeping
forces to go on alert, security sources said.
   The reported buildup came a day after a bomb injured at least two
militiamen in the Israeli-controlled buffer zone along the border
with Israel. The pro-Iranian Hezbollah group today claimed
responsibility for the attack.
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army spokesman said he had no
information in connection with the report.
   The Lebanese security sources said a joint convoy of 35 armored
personnel carriers and trucks was spotted moving near the village of
Taireh, 16 miles east of Tyre, in the central sector of the security
zone.
   In the eastern sector, a force of 50 Israeli troops with seven
tanks, three personnel carriers, and four trucks entered the village
of Kawkaba in the area of the U.N.'s Norwegian contingent, the
security sources said.
   There were no details on the mission of the forces.
   ``The U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon has been put on very high
alert to cope with any eventuality,'' one source said on condition
of anonymity.
   He said the movements involved both the Israeli army and its
proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army.
   Sunday's explosion took place at Beit Yahoun, just north of
Taireh, at the entrance to the zone.
   In addition to the two South Lebanon Army militiamen, the bomb
wounded two civilian passers-by, police said.
   However, Israeli military sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the two were wounded when Hezbollah militiamen fired
light weapons Sunday at Lebanese civilians waiting at the Beit
Yahoun checkpoint.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the explosion in a communique that claimed its
guerrillas destroyed an Israeli intelligence base at Beit Yahoun.
The communique said 15 soldiers were killed.
   An Irish corporal with the U.N. forces said Sunday's bomb
destroyed a three-story building used by Israeli troops and
militiamen to search people entering the zone.

   Several strong earthquakes shook
Ethiopia and caused some damage in neighboring Djibouti, officials
said today.
   There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties in
Ethiopia.
   The first temblor registered 6.4 on the Richter scale and
occurred at 2:17 p.m. Sunday about 320 miles northeast of Addis
Ababa and 100 miles northwest of Djibouti.
   Subsequent quakes, registering up to 6.5 on the open-ended scale,
struck the same area today at 3:48 a.m., 4:09 a.m. and 4:50 a.m.,
said Dr. Gebre-Berhan Equba-Egzi of the University of Ethiopia's
geology department.
   The department is responsible for measuring seismic activity in
Ethiopia, but Gebre-Berhan said the quakes were too strong and too
near to be assessed by their equipment.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Golden, Colorado, said the second
temblor this morning measured 6.5 on the Richter scale.
   In Djibouti, the Geophysical Observatory reported that although
the quake epicenter was in Ethiopia, minor property damage was
reported in the town of Yoboki, about 62 miles west of the capital
and close to the Ethiopian border. No injuries were reported.
   Gebre-Berhan estimated the worst affected area in Ethiopia would
be in the province of Wollo between Dubti and Serdo, where the
government runs five large commercial farms. The area is sparsely
populated and its flat, dry landscape is dotted with occassional
mountains.
   A source at the Ministry of State Farm Development said it did
not yet have any reports from the farms, but the highway to the port
of Assab had been blocked by rocks thrown off a mountain about 370
miles northeast of Addis Ababa.
   In 1961, an earthquake of similar severity hit the same region
causing several buildings to collapse in Karakore, near Serdo and
Dubti.

<HEAD>Death Toll At Three in New York Steam Blast</HEAD>

   Thermal stress when cold water hit a hot,
pressurized steam pipe under Manhattan may have caused a colossal
blowup of steam and mud that killed three people, a utility
spokesman said.
   ``The steam is going through at such a high pressure that
anything might have affected the integrity of the pipe and caused it
to break,'' Consolidated Edison spokesman Marty Gitten said Sunday.
   The cold water could have come from the leaking water main that
was under repair when the explosion occurred or from a nearby fire
hydrant, Gitten said, but it may be months before investigators know
for sure.
   ``It's not unlike putting together a puzzle after an airline
crash. We have to literally put the pieces of damaged pipe back
together and re-create the scene,'' Gitten said.
   The blast from the 24-inch steam pipe Saturday night ripped open
a Manhattan street and sprayed steam and mud as high as 15 stories.
   The steam is piped to buildings who use it for heating and
sometimes to run machinery. The utility has about 2,000 steam
customers in lower Manhattan, Gitten said.
   A woman sleeping in her third-floor apartment and a Consolidated
Edison worker were killed in the blast. A second Con Ed worker who
was burned died overnight, authorities said. At least 18 other
people were injured, one critically, and hundreds of people were
evacuated from damaged apartments.
   The pipe exploded as four Con Ed workers were opening one of its
valves to restore the pipe to service, Gitten said. It had been
turned off as a precaution early Saturday as the city repaired a
water leak on the same block.
   When the pipe ripped open, it blasted chunks of asphalt, rocks
and mud over a one-block area.
   ``I actually saw the street rise,'' said Tom Ritchford, 27, who
was with Denise Ozker, 29, in a sidewalk cafe when the street blew
open a few feet away. ``When it came up, I covered my face and
stepped under the table and pulled Denise under the table with me.''

<HEAD>Rash of Escapes Brings 1,400 More East Germans to West</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 1,400 more East Germans escaped
to West Germany over the weekend in the largest such flight since
the Hungarian uprising was crushed in 1956, officials said today.
   The latest batch of refugees included 980 East Germans who
crossed illegally into Austria from Hungary, according to Austrian
officials.
   In West Germany, a spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl said
hard-line leaders of East Germany could solve the problem by
instituting reforms.
   ``We would like to see (the East German leadership) move in the
same direction of reform as their neighboring Communist states,''
Hans Klein said.
   The opposition Social Democratic party made a similar appeal to
East German leaders.
   At least 500 of the refugees slipped through a border gate
between Hungary and Austria that had been opened Saturday for an
event celebrating European unity.
   Austrian authorities said the weekend surge into their country
was the largest outpouring they had seen since Soviet troops put
down the anti-Stalinist uprising in Hungary.
   More than 10,000 East Germans have made their way to West Germany
in August, according to Manfred Kersten, a spokesman for a West
German resettlement camp in Giessen. He said about 1,400 more East
Germans arrived at the camp over the weekend.
   The camp, about 30 miles north of Frankfurt, has become so
crowded in recent weeks that West Germany has converted a military
barracks near Muenster for the overflow.
   Kohl returned to Bonn today after a three-week vacation in
Austria and immediately took up the refugee issue, Klein said. He
said Kohl was expected to announce plans for dealing with the
problem on Tuesday.
   The exodus of East Germans is the largest since the Berlin Wall
was built in 1961. More than 65,000 East Germans are estimated to
have escaped or legally emigrated to West Germany this year.
   Officials of the Inter-German Affairs Ministry say they expect up
to 100,000 East Germans to arrive in West Germany this year.
   Many of the East Germans who have fled to West Germany recently
have said they left because they saw little hope of social or
economic reform at home.
   The problem worsened after Hungary took down fences at the
Austrian border in May, leading to a crush of East Germans crossing
there.
   The many East German refugees have overwhelmed West German
diplomats, who have closed their missions in East Berlin and
Budapest.
   Representatives of East Germany, West Germany and Hungary have
tried to find a solution. East Berlin authorities have accused West
Germany of encouraging the escapes.
   West Germany's ambassador to Vienna, Dieter Graf von Bruehl, told
Austrian TV that 660 East Germans were taken in by the Embassy on
Saturday and that another 160 had come to the Embassy on Sunday.
   Officials in the Austrian border town of Moerbisch reported that
another 160 East Germans crossed Sunday night.

   Military and police forces today raided
properties of suspected cocaine traffickers in a sweep of the
nation's powerful drug underworld that has already led to more than
10,000 arrests.
   There were no reports, however, of any drug cartel bosses
arrested in the emergency crackdown, which follows the
assassinations of a leading presidential candidate, a national
police colonel and a magistrate.
   In renewed guerrilla attacks, eight policemen and two peasants
were killed, police and news reports said today.
   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the 46-year-old Liberal Party candidate,
was buried Sunday after hundreds of thousands of people took to the
streets in a public display of grief.
   Meanwhile, thousands of judges and magistrates who walked off the
job last week to protest inadequate security from hitmen hired by
drug traffickers have called off the strike to join the fight, a
spokesman said.
   The Defense Ministry today reported 10,450 people detained in 321
raids nationwide. Ministry communiques said 622 weapons were seized
as well as 1,023 vehicles. Four tons of cocaine paste also were
reported confiscated.
   Among the sites raided were buildings and ranches in and around
the city of Medellin that are owned by Pablo Escobar, reputed to be
one of the world's biggest cocaine traffickers.
   According to the ministry, at one ranch owned by Escobar,
military forces detained 52 people and seized 2,000 head of cattle,
100 pigs, 3,000 gallons of gasoline and several cars and trucks.
   Properties owned by the family of Jorge Ochoa and by Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha, two other top reputed cocaine dealers, also were
raided, the ministry said.
   Galan was gunned down at a political rally in Soacha, a town 20
miles south of Bogota. His killing capped a wave of drug-related
assassinations that also included a national police colonel in
Medellin and a Bogota magistrate.
   Later Friday, President Virgilio Barco declared a state of siege
and announced emergency decrees empowering the government to
summarily extradite drug traffickers, several of whom are sought by
the United States on smuggling charges.
   He also gave police extraordinary powers to arrest and seize the
property of suspected dealers, stiffened penalties and established
special protection for the country's judges.
   Speaking at Galan's funeral in a packed central cathedral, Barco
declared: ``We pray to God to give each of us, each Colombian, all
the courage and all the fortitude that we need to face the challenge
of terrorism.
   ``Once again, this time moved by sadness, I call for
international solidarity to fight this international organization,''
he said. He called the cocaine underworld ``a gigantic and powerful
organization such has never existed in the world'' and described
Colombia as ``its biggest victim.''
   Galan had survived previous attempts on his life. Police said
drug traffickers offered $500,000 for his death.
   About 400,000 people lined the three-mile route from the
cathedral to the central cemetery where Galan was buried. They waved
campaign banners and many wept openly and cried out loud for
justice. Campaign billboards, with Galan's smiling image, were
bordered in black.
   At the cemetery, as the coffin was lowered, thousands of
Colombians chanted, ``Galan is still here!''
   In a funeral sermon, Roman Catholic Cardinal Mario Revollo Bravo
declared, ``The country is morally ill,'' but he vowed: ``The nation
will not succumb to a handful of criminals.''
   The drug cartels announced Saturday they would step up violence
in a bid to force the government to negotiate with them, although
they have never publicly stated their demands in detail.
   In a communique released to radio stations and signed ``The
Extraditables'' _ a reference to those drug leaders wanted in the
United States _ the cartels said ``now the fight is with blood.''
   The country's 4,500 judges and magistrates, who went on strike
after the assassination Thursday of Bogota Magistrate Carlos
Velenica Garcia, announced plans to end the protest on Tuesday when
courts reopen after a regular holiday today.
   ``It's not the time for strikes or resignations,'' said Judge
Jose Gabriel Salom, president of the Bogota Superior Court. He and
47 colleagues presented their resignations, but Salom said they
would be withdrawn.
   Scores of judges prosecuting drug cases often have been
assassinated, and the strike and resignations were intended to
dramatize what the courts felt was a lack of security.
   In the province of Huila south of Bogota, leftist guerrillas
ambushed a police truck on a highway, killing eight officers and
possibly kidnapping two others, local news reports said today.
   A police statement published by Bogota newspapers blamed the
attack on the Revolutionary Armed Forces, one of several leftist
guerrilla groups operating in the country.
   The ten police were driving about 90 miles south of Bogota when a
guerrilla bomb was detonated, the reports said. The guerrillas then
sprayed the truck with automatic weapon fire.
   Authorities reportedly found the bodies of the eight policemen at
the site, and the two others were missing and believed kidnapped.
   In a separate attack, guerrillas raided a small village near the
town of Palestina, about 240 miles south of Bogota, and killed two
peasants, police said.

   Sports fans and entertainment buffs spent nearly
$1.6 million during a two-day marathon auction of rare cards, proofs
and paintings by the Topps Co., an auction company official said
today.
   The biggest item was a 1953 Mickey Mantle original, which went
for $110,000.
   ``This sporting crowd has a lot of stamina,'' said Arlan
Ettinger, president of Guernsey's, after a 10-hour auction Sunday
that followed a 13-hour swap on Saturday. Today, Ettinger put the
final total at $1.58 million.
   The 2,250 lots auctioned by the house contained more than 25,000
paintings, drawings, and flexichromes.
   Many of the more valuable items were cards by Bowman, Topps'
archrival in bubblegum cards until Topps bought its competitor in
1955.
   A 4-inch by 6-inch Bowman portrait of Frank Gifford brought
$5,000, while line drawings of Wilt Chamberlain and Lew Alcindor
sold for $2,000, Ettinger said.
   Some of the lots strayed from the sports theme.
   A late 50's original of Elvis Presley from the ``Who-Z-At-Star''
card series brought $605. The 3-inch by 5-inch flexichrome photo,
extensively painted over, shows the King from the waist up, mouth
wide open in singing position, in what Ettinger described as ``a
very loud bathrobe with a velvet collar.''
   Uncut proof sheets of basketball and football cards, typically of
132 different athletes, sold in the range of $1500 to $2000,
Ettinger said.

   A Boeing 747 carrying space shuttle
Columbia back to its launching base landed here today after bad
weather forced an overnight stop in Georgia, interrupting a flight
from California.
   The modified jetliner, with the 97-ton Columbia bolted on it
back, touched down at 11:44 a.m. after a flight of slightly more
than an hour from Robins Air Base near Warner Robins, Ga.
   The aircraft left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., on Sunday,
stopping at Sheppard Air Force Base, in Wichita Falls, Texas, for
refueling. Thunderstorms in central Florida prevented it from flying
directly to Cape Canaveral from Texas and it was diverted to Georgia
in late afternoon.
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration officials say rain
poses a danger to the heat-resistant tiles that protect the shuttle
during re-entry to the earth's atmosphere.
   Columbia, the nation's oldest shuttle, landed in California's
Mojave Desert on Aug. 13 after a five-day secret military mission,
which reportedly included deployment of a spy satellite and
experiments related to the ``Star Wars'' anti-missile program.
   Bad weather in the Southwest delayed its piggyback ride back
East, which originally had been scheduled for Saturday, NASA
spokesman Don Haley said.
   Columbia sustained minor damage to its heat-shield tiles during
the mission this month, its first flight in 3{ years. A steering
thruster failed and the pilot's seat suddenly jerked backward during
launch, but none of the problems was considered serious, NASA
officials said.
   The next shuttle flight is scheduled for Oct. 12, when Atlantis
will carry the Galileo space probe into orbit so it can be launched
on a six-year voyage to Jupiter. Columbia's next mission is
scheduled for December.

<TEXT>
   Conservationist George Adamson was slain by
bandits near the wildlife reserve where he and his late wife, ``Born
Free'' author Joy Adamson, taught lions raised in captivity to live
in the wild.
   Adamson, 83, was killed Sunday as he drove head on into a group
of Somali bandits who had robbed and beat his assistants. Shifta, or
roaming bands of Somali tribesmen, are believed responsible for most
of the animal poaching in Kenya.
   Adamson and his wife together helped popularize wildlife
conservation. Joy Adamson was killed in 1980 by a young servant in a
wage dispute.
   After hearing gunfire, Adamson and three workers drove about a
mile from the Kora National Reserve to help the assistants, Director
of Wildlife Richard Leakey said today at a news conference. Leakey
went to Kora to investigate the incident.
   Arriving at the scene of the attack, Adamson ignored pleas to
stop from other occupants in his car, put his foot on the gas and
drove straight at the bandits, Leakey said. Adamson and two of his
assistants in his car died in the barrage.
   ``George was a brave man,'' Leakey said at a news conference.
   He said about 150 security personnel had been deployed in the
region since the attack and an area an 80-mile radius from Adamson's
camp had been cordoned off.
   ``We intend to find the attackers and bring them to justice,''
said Leakey.
   He said the government had been increasingly concerned about
attacks by Shifta since a major anti-poaching effort pushed most of
them out of Kenya's game reserves.
   However, Adamson refused any additional protection and did not
want to be removed from Kora, where he felt well protected by his 16
lions and more than half a dozen assistants, Leakey said.
   It was due largely to activism by Adamson, who moved to Kora and
leased the area from a county council in 1971, that the government
made it a game reserve three years later.
   As a result of encroachment by nomadic Somali tribesmen and their
herds, Adamson pressured Kenya into calling in paramilitary
anti-poaching troops to drive out the Somalis.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1983, Adamson said
he had been told of a plot by Somalis to murder him in the hope that
with him gone, authorities would be under little pressure to police
the reserve.
   ``I think that George always was aware that that was a risk and
that he was treading on somebody's toes,'' said one of Adamson's
close associates.
   Adamson was game warden of Kenya's northern Frontier District in
1944 when he married Joy, an Austrian-born artist whose books would
thrust him into fame.
   After living apart from her husband, Joy moved to the game
reserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards.
   In 1956, her husband brought home three motherless lion cubs.
One, which they named Elsa, became the central character of ``Born
Free.'' Adamson served as technical director for a film adaptation.
   That book and its sequels, ``Living Free'' and ``Forever Free,''
described the Adamsons' unique and controversial practice of taking
lions born in captivity and teaching them to survive on their own
before freeing them.
   The government stopped the practice in 1980 after a mauling
incident in Kora in 1980.
   Adamson, whose shoulder-length hair and goatee gave him a
lion-like appearance, kept a modest camp in Kora and lived off a
pension, interest from a trust fund set up by his wife, and
donations from supporters.
   He wrote two books of his own, ``Bwana Game'' and an
autobiography ``My Pride and Joy.''
   Adamson was born in India in 1906 and first visited Kenya in
1924. He later moved to the East African nation and joined its game
department in 1938. He retired as game warden in 1963.
   He had no children.

   A Canadian woman trying to sail alone across the
Atlantic Ocean was located southwest of England today, 10 days after
she was last heard from, the coast guard said.
   A passing cargo vessel, the Everglobe, contacted Jane Weber more
than 80 miles from Land's End on the southwestern tip of Britain,
said Mike Quinn of the Falmouth coast guard station.
   ``Jane wished to pass ashore that all was well on board, she was
safe and well and she hoped to make Plymouth in about three days
time,'' Quinn said.
   He said she was able to talk to the ship on her handheld radio,
which has very limited range.
   Weber left Halifax, Nova Scotia, on July 29 in a bid to be the
first Canadian woman ever to cross the Atlantic alone. She had hoped
to finish her 2,700 mile voyage by today.
   However, the 44-year-old sailor had not been heard from since
Aug. 11, when she reported problems with her electrical generator.
The device powers her communications and radar equipment.
   The coast guard had asked all commercial ships and air force
reconnaissance planes to watch for her 43-foot cutter, Tilley
Endurable.
   ``We're very pleased for her ... and she's relieved that she's
been able to let us know where she is,'' said Quinn.

   Film producer Toby Halicki, who won a cult
following with car-crash movies, was killed when a water tower fell
prematurely during preparations for a stunt that local officials
initially had tried to prevent.
   Halicki, 48, of Gardena, Calif., was killed Sunday during filming
for the movie ``Gone in 60 Seconds II,'' Tonawanda Police Officer
Michael Thorp said.
   The collapse of the 141-foot water tower apparently caused an
attached cable to snap and knock over a telephone pole, which fell
on Halicki, Thorp said.
   An emergency medical technician and a nurse worked to save
Halicki, but he was pronounced dead on arrival at Kenmore Mercy
Hospital. Thorp said Halicki died of internal injuries.
   Halicki, who also was directing and starring in the film, had
fought with local officials for two months for permission to topple
the water tower, located in an abandoned industrial park. He was
allowed to go ahead only after obtaining $8 million worth of
insurance.
   Tonawanda Town Supervisor Ronald Moline had accused Halicki of
``flying by the seat of his pants.''
   In an interview with The Associated Press just hours before his
death, Halicki denied his stunts were unsafe and said he thought
town officials were out to ``make my life as miserable as they
could.''
   This morning, Moline called the accident a tragedy, adding, ``I'm
not one of those types of people to take any satisfaction out of
what happened, like, `I told you so.'''
   However, he said, ``one of the ironies of this situation is that
perhaps the Halicki family will benefit from some of these insurance
coverages he took.''
   Halicki, a native of nearby Dunkirk, was born Henry B. Halicki
but was known as Toby.
   He returned to the area three months ago to shoot segments for
the sequel to his 1974 cult movie ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' in which
Halicki played a car thief. The title refers to the time it takes a
professional thief to steal a car.
   The movie was called a cinematic demolition derby, and more of
the same kind of action was planned for the sequel.
   Halicki was filming a sequence in which a tractor-trailer was to
slam its way through a series of cars before ramming the water tower.
   The scene was set up in an abandoned industrial park on the
Buffalo-Tonawanda line. Halicki said Tonawanda officials originally
turned him down when he requested to film the stunt.
   ``He sent back a letter that said, `We don't want you in our
town, period,''' Halicki said, referring to Moline.
   ``I wound up furnishing them with $8 million worth of insurance,
(and) a $10,000 cash bond to make sure I'd clean up after the
debris, which I understand they've never done to anyone. And I'm
looking to sue them when I'm done, because I don't think they had
the right to do this to me on private property.''
   In the scene, a tractor-trailer was to run into the base of the
water tower, and cables attached to trucks were to help pull down
the structure. One of those cables apparently snapped and knocked
the telephone pole onto Halicki.
   During filming earlier Sunday, Halicki frequently shouted
warnings to the crew and observers to stay clear as car crashes _
and accompanying explosions _ took place. ``Everybody clear out,''
he yelled at one point. ``There's going to be a big explosion.''
   He said he no longer did many of the dangerous stunts in his
movies, explaining that a close call while shooting his 1982 ``Junk
Man'' had made him more careful.
   ``I've had some very close calls,'' he said. ``I had a head-on
collision with an airplane on my last film. We hit at a combined
speed of over 200 mph and we crashed the plane and put about 80
stitches in my head. I was very lucky.''
   Halicki said, ``You can always have chase sequences where things
go wrong. You have to be careful. We fine-tune it a great deal, but
we have to work in a margin of safety.''
   As was the case in the original, Halicki had financed the
production of ``Gone in 60 Seconds II'' himself and said he was
looking to have it released through a major studio.

<HEAD>Soviet Jews Begin Transiting Budapest On Way To Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary has begun allowing Soviet Jews to fly
to Israel through Budapest, becoming the second East European
country to permit the transit of such immigrants, the World Jewish
Congress said Monday.
   The Hungarian decision is a harbinger of the establishment of
full diplomatic ties between Israel and Hungary in the coming weeks
and of direct flights between the Soviet Union and Israel in the
future, said WJC sources.
   Establishment of Hungary as a third transit point, in addition to
Austria and Romania, is also expected to ease the processing of an
increasing flow of Jews being allowed to leave the Soviet Union
under the liberalized policies of Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The first group of Soviet Jews _ a couple with two children _
came through Budapest last Monday, and small groups have been
arriving from the Soviet Union every day since, said the sources,
who spoke only on condition they not be further identified.
   The recently opened office of the World Jewish Congress in
Budapest pays for the emigres' overnight stay, gives them an
orientation talk and puts them on a direct flight to Israel the next
day, said the sources. Direct flight from Budapest to Tel Aviv on
the two countries' national carriers, El Al and Hungary's Malev,
began several months ago.
   Some 50,000 people, most of them Jews, are expected to emigrate
from the Soviet Union this year, about 80,000 are projected for 1990
and larger numbers in the following years. More than 80 percent of
the emigres go to the United States.
   But an increasing number is going to Israel as they get turned
away from the United States because of a budget crunch that limits
refugee slots and a massive backlog in the processing of immigration
requests in Moscow.
   Romania, the only Eastern European country that did not break off
ties with Israel after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has been allowing
Soviet Jews to transit through Bucharest for several years.
   Hungary renewed ties with Israel last year at the consular level,
and is expected to become the first East European country to renew
full ties, probably in the fall.

   The Italian air force stunt-flying team

   The Tricolor Arrows will perform for the first time since the
Aug. 28, 1988, disaster in Ramstein, West Germany, when three jets
collided and one hurtled into a crowd of spectators. Seventy people,
including the three pilots, were killed.
   Col. Alberto Da Forno, an air force spokesman, said the

Charleroi, Belgium.
   The team, which has been training at the Rivolto airport near

   A few dozen union protesters set out
Monday to demonstrate against the Chafin Coal Co., but quickly ran
into a problem. The company, they discovered, no longer exists.
   Undeterred, the demonstrators wound up marching in a drenching
rain outside a bank with ties to the defunct company's owner, who
was nowhere to be found.
   The demonstrators from the United Mine Workers, joined by about a
dozen members of the Communications Workers of America, were
protesting what they charged were unfair labor practices by Chafin.
   The company, they said, ceased mining operations in order to lay
off union mineworkers, and then subleased the mines to other
companies that hired non-union workers.
   The protesters arrived at the former headquarters of Chafin Coal
at about 9 a.m., but found the stone building abandoned and nothing
but a boat trailer in the parking lot.
   The demonstrators paraded single-file in front of the building
for a while, but eventually tired of that and moved on to the Chafin
Building in downtown Huntington. They were told the building is not
affiliated with Chafin Coal.
   The 30 or so protesters finally landed at Guarantee National
Bank, where Chafin's former president, John Chafin Sr., is on the
board of directors.
   There was no indication that Chafin was at the bank, or even in
Huntington. Calls to his home telephone went unanswered; a telephone
at the home of John Chafin Jr., a company vice president, had been
disconnected.
   Guarantee National Bank President Mark Sprouse was not in his
office, a secretary said, and could not be reached for comment. The
secretary said she couldn't figure out why the bank was being
picketed.
   Gary White, president of the West Virginia Coal Association, said
the Chafin Coal building first picketed was the last known address
for the company. He said he did not know what had happened to the
company.
   One of the demonstrators, Fred O. Hartman, a roof bolter who has
been out of work for two years, insisted that Chafin has opened new
mines but hasn't called back union workers.
   ``They say that they're not open anymore, but you call and every
time they answer the phone, they say `Chafin Coal Co,''' Hartman
said. ``Sounds like they are open to me.''
   However, callers trying to reach Chafin Coal on Monday were told
its telephone lines either have been disconnected or changed to
unpublished numbers.
   Hartman said local union presidents held a meeting Sunday night
and decided on the Chafin demonstration. ``They've subleased the
coal out but John Chafin's still responsible for it,'' Hartman said.

<HEAD>Meat Prices Rise Despite Warning Strikes</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Poland, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meat prices rose Monday by an average of
6.5 percent despite recent protest strikes by hundreds of thousands
of workers, the official MTI news agency reported.
   The state-run meat industry stood firm in its decision to
increase prices although the government and the official trade union
federation SZOT jointly appealed against the move, MTI said.
   State-controlled industries have a great deal of autonomy in
Hungary, one of the most liberal Soviet bloc countries, and
sometimes make decisions independent of the Communist
Party-controlled government.
   Imre Mike, meat industry general director, told MTI the joint
appeal arrived at industry headquarters on Friday _ too late to
postpone the price increase. The news agency did not specifiy
whether the appeal would affect plans for a Sept. 4 price increase
of 6 percent.
   Opposition to the price increases resulted in widespread work
stoppages of up to one hour Friday. But MTI said only about half of
the 2 million people took part in the strike.
   Most of the strikers were steel workers, while food industry and
meat producers heeded an appeal by a newly established independent
trade union federation and kept working, said MTI.
   The meat industry has said the price increases were necessary
because increased feed and fertilizer costs led to a drop in meat
production.

<HEAD>Aid to Latin Countries in Drug Package</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will submit a $7.5
billion to $8 billion anti-drug package to Congress next month that
will include increased aid to Latin American countries, White House
chief of staff John Sununu said today.
   However, Sununu said there are no plans to send U.S. troops to
Colombia to fight the cocaine industry, and that Bush would be wary
of doing so even if the South American nation's president, Virgilio
Barco Vargas, requested such help.
   ``There is a tradition in the Western Hemisphere, a reluctance
for anyone to ask for troops and a reluctance of the president to
commit troops,'' he told reporters after meeting with the
vacationing Bush.
   On the subject of new threats to American hostages held by
Islamic militants in Lebanon, Sununu said there had been no change
in U.S. policy.
   ``We are not going to react to each new threat,'' he said. ``The
policy remains unchanged. The president underscored that the
hostage-takers are responsible for the safety of all the hostages.''
   A pro-Iranian group said Sunday that it would consider killing
two American hostages if the French navy intervenes in Lebanon,
which has been plagued by civil war.
   ``Basically it is our policy not to try to increase attention on
the hostages,'' Sununu said.
   He added: ``The French have made it clear they have no intention
to intervene and that the ships are there merely to assist French
nationals who want to leave.''
   Bush will present details of his drug stratagy in a Sept. 5
speech to the nation.
   Although there have been various reports on the price tag of the
plan, Sununu's reference to a cost of $7.5 billion to $8 billion
marked the first time the administration has publicly offered a
figure.
   Much of the money will be reprogrammed from other programs,
Sununu said. He said the main focus of the plan would be domestic,
although it would contain funds to help Latin American countries
fight drug traffic at the source.
   But Sununu backed away from comments made Sunday by Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh that the administration should consider
sending troops to Colombia if invited.
   He said the administration drug policy does not envision sending
U.S. troops to Latin Aerican country to fight drugs.
   Sununu said Bush made most final decisions on the drug package
today, sending a series of directives back to budget director
Richard Darman on where to siphon funds from other programs to help
pay for the effort.
   Earlier, Bush spoke briefly with reporters on the golf course and
said he had been briefed by Sununu on the latest threat to U.S.
hostages and was leaving it to his staff chief ``to explain our
position.''
   A pro-Iranian extremist group believed to be holding American
hostages Joseph Cicippio and Edward Austin Tracy issued death
threats Sunday against the two men if French ships in the
Mediterranean intervene in Lebanon's civil war.
   The statement by a Shiite Moslem group, which calls itself the
Revolutionary Justice Organization, was accompanied by a photocopy
of a photograph of Tracy the group released Aug. 1.
   French officials said the ships were sent to be ready to evacuate
7,000 French nationals in Lebanon if necessary, but there was no
intention of intervening in Lebanon.
   The president began his day today by taking a 21-minute dawn jog
near his family's seaside compound with his daughter, Dorothy
LeBlond, and three reporters.

<TEXT>
   A Florida man said today that he and
his wife survived 66 days at sea on raw fish and purified water
after whales rammed and sank their pleasure boat off the Central
American coast.
   William Butler, 59, and his 56-year-old wife, Simone, of Miami,
were taken to a hospital in Golfito, Costa Rica, after being rescued
by a Costa Rican coast guard crew Saturday about 20 miles off that
city's Pacific coast, Butler said.
   The Butlers were sailing their 40-foot boat, the Siboney, from
Coral Gables, Fla., near Miami, to Honolulu, Hawaii, for a vacation,
according to U.S. Coast Guard spokesman Egbert Vallecillo.
   They left Panama to start the Pacific leg of their journey on May
24, Butler said in an interview, today.
   On June 15, a group of whales attacked the boat, he said.
   ``In no more than 15 minutes, our boat was destroyed,'' he said
by telephone from the hospital. ``But God, always present in our
prayers, helped us because we carried a life raft and we got in it
immediately, taking all the things we would need.''
   He said they had eight cans of food, some cookies, a water
purifier and a fishing hook.
   ``But after 20 days adrift, all the food was gone. After that, we
started fishing. Thanks to God, we were lucky, and all the time we
had food and with the filter, we drank good water.''
   Butler shed 49 of his 175 pounds, and his wife went from 150
pounds to 92, he said, he said.
   ``They are weak, but they are expected to recover,'' said
Vallecillo, who spoke to Butler by telephone from the U.S. Coast
Guard's Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of
San Francisco.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials their boat was attacked and
sunk by ``several'' whales about 1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica.
   ``They were large, according to Mr. Butler; but he didn't know
how many whales,'' Vallecillo said.
   Butler told Coast Guard officials he is an experienced sailor.
   Vallecillo said he has heard of boats running into marine mammals
when visibility is poor, but he wasn't sure if there have been any
recorded cases of whale aggression.
   The couple's last radio contact was June 13, when they talked to
their daughter, Susan Smith, in Miami.
   ``This is an execeptional case, in that they were prepared with
fishing equipment and the desalinization unit,'' Vallecillo said.
   During the two months adrift, the lifeboat moved slowly eastward.
The Butlers caught between 400 and 500 pounds of fish and survived
multiple shark attacks by sealing punctures with a raft repair kit,
Vallecillo said.
   Butler told U.S. Coast Guard officials that several times they
spotted merchant ships but were unable to flag them down.
   On Saturday, the Costa Rican ship finally saw the raft and
rescued the couple.

<HEAD>East German Leader in Hospital Again for Surgery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German leader Erich Honecker has been
hospitalized again following surgery to remove gallstones, it was
reported Monday.
   Honecker, who will be 77 on Friday, was also hospitalized last
month for treatment of health problems related to gallstones. That
illness forced him to leave the Warsaw Pact summit in Bucharest on
July 8, before its conclusion.
   The official news agency ADN said the Communist Party leader was
``on the road to recovery'' after an operation to remove gallstones
last week, but provided no other details of Honecker's condition.
   Honecker appeared in public last week for the first time in more
than a month, looking relatively fit. His absence had fueled rumors
he was in poor health.
   Although neighboring Hungary and Poland have instituted broad
democratic reforms of the type championed by Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, Honecker's leadership has made clear that it plans no
major change in the Communist Party's monopoly on power.
   That stance by the East Berlin leadership has disenchanted many
East Germans and prompted a recent exodus to West Germany.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 2,000 Czechoslovaks defied
police bans today and rallied on the 21st anniversary of the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia to call for the kind of
reforms the invasion crushed.
   ``Freedom, freedom,'' yelled the crowd, adding, ``Long Live
Hungary.'' The neighboring Communist country has embarked on the
kind of political reforms Czechoslovakia's entrenched leaders have
rejected.
   Police moved in to break up the rally just ten minutes after it
started.
   At least a handful of people were seen being detained in the
melee, and helmeted riot police moved in force into Wenceslas
Square, the half-mile long boulevard in central Prague where the
rally began.
   Many tourists were watching the demonstration on the square, and
some of them applauded when shouts of ``freedom'' were heard.
   Warsaw Pact tanks rolled into Czechoslovakia on Aug. 21, 1968,
choking the ``Prague Spring'' reforms of Alexander Dubcek, the
Communist Party leader who was ousted in 1969 and expelled from the
party in 1970. He is today a pensioner in Bratislava, but has issued
increasingly strong calls for reform to resume.
   On Sunday, more than 30 young people were led to a police bus
after trying to march in central Prague as they have every day since
Aug. 1. Dozens of police patrols roamed the city, checking the
documents of passers-by. At least one Western photographer was
forced to hand over film to police.
   Dana Nemcova, one of the few well-known dissidents not warned by
police to leave Prague for the anniversary, said plainclothes men
came to her door before 7 a.m. and placed her and her activist son,
David, under two-day house arrest.
   Nemcova is a spokeswoman for the Charter 77 dissident group.
   Plainclothes police also were guarding the home of Anna Sabatova
and Petr Uhl, two well-known dissidents who have not been seen for
two days. It was not known whether they had been detained.
   In their efforts to curb dissent leading up to the anniversary,
authorities have cut the telephone lines of at least four well-known
dissidents and harassed several others.
   Two activists, Jan Carnogursky and Miroslav Kusy, were arrested
last week and face charges that could jail them for up to 10 years.
They had called on people in Bratislava to lay flowers in memory of
those who died resisting the invasion.
   Last year, about 10,000 people marched through Prague on the
invasion anniversary, shouting demands for freedom, Dubcek and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   In the past year, thousands of Czechoslovaks have signed
petitions demanding dialogue with Communist authorities and reforms
such as those in neighboring Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   But the Communist leaders who were put in power by Moscow after
the 1968 invasion have so far refused to institute political change.
   ``The question of political power was decisively settled here
forever in 1948,'' the year of the communist takeover, Karel
Urbanek, a Politburo member, said Saturday.
   Poland and Hungary, which are experimenting with democratic
reform, have condemned the invasion in recent weeks. On Sunday,
Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth said his government also condemned
Hungary's participation in the invasion.
   East Germany, whose leader Erich Honecker also has resisted
reform in his country, by contrast printed an article saying the
invasion was necessary. The Soviet Union has issued no official
statement on it.

   Two couples were charged today for a
bullet-punctuated chase that authorities say ended a daring
helicopter escape from a Colorado prison.
   Bond was set was $1 million each for Patricia and Fredrico
Gonzales when the couple appeared before Magistrate Marvin Watson in
Phelps County Court. The judge also scheduled a preliminary hearing
for the pair for Thursday.
   Another couple, Rebecca and Ralph P. Brown, were scheduled to
appear in court later today.
   The four could face charges in Colorado and federal courts, in
addition to the Nebraska state charges brought today.
   All four were charged with criminal attempt and using a firearm
to commit a felony, said Dee Berry, deputy county court clerk. The
criminal attempt count is a form of attempted murder charge, and
carries a penalty of one to 50 years in prison under state law.
   In addition, the two men were charged with being felons in
possession of a firearm, said Ms. Berry.
   Brown and Gonzales, cellmates at the the medium-security Arkansas
Valley Correctional Facility in Ordway, Colo., escaped Friday after
the wives hijacked a helicopter at gunpoint and forced the pilot to
land in the prison yard, authorities said.
   The women had rented the helicopter on the pretext of looking at
real estate.
   After picking up the men, the helicopter landed a few miles away
and the four transferred to a rental van, leaving the pilot, Tim
Graves, tied up in a shed. He was unhurt.
   The four were captured eight hours later after exchanging heavy
gunfire with authorities in this Nebraska town, 400 miles from the
prison.
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver said he planned to file
federal charges today, probably including air piracy. Colorado
officials said they have plans for escape charges.
   The four were captured after their van's license plates were
spotted when they stopped in the town of Arapahoe, Colo. A police
dispatcher radioed ahead to Holdrege, where they were arrested eight
hours after the escape.
   ``How we got caught was that I needed to use the bathroom real
bad,'' Mrs. Gonzales said in a prison interview from Holdrege.
``They wouldn't let us stop, but finally my husband made them stop.
That's when we were seen. They saw us in the little town named
Arapahoe.''
   Mrs. Gonzales, 41, said she had been pressured into taking part
in the escape by Mrs. Brown, 26, who thought up the idea of freeing
the husbands.
   ``I did what I did because I felt I was really pressured. I was
scared what might happen to us,'' said Mrs. Gonzales.
   ``I love him enough to die for him.''
   Mrs. Gonzales, a grandmother with hearts tattooed on her chest,
used to work with prison inmates as a volunteer. She met Gonzales,
20 years her junior, at a prison and married him by proxy earlier
this year. She was dismissed from her volunteer work for misusing
her prison clearance.
   Mrs. Brown, interviewed by The Rocky Mountain News in jail on
Sunday, said she didn't want to kill anybody, ``I just wanted my
husband out.''
   She told the Denver newspaper that she drove the van during the
gunfight in Holdrege.
   ``I don't remember what was going on,'' she said. ``I was just
trying to drive the car while under the dashboard, which was about
three-fourths of the time. My husband had been dodging all the
buckshots and finally he rolled over to the floor and told me to
stop.''

   Two space shuttles were on the move
Monday, with Columbia returning from California where it ended a
mission and Atlantis joining with rockets that will boost it toward
orbit in October.
   Columbia came back to its launch base bolted atop a Boeing 747
jetliner that was forced to make an overnight stop in Georgia
because of thunderstorms.
   The 747 left Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., early Sunday and
made a refueling stop in Texas before being diverted to Robins Air
Base, Ga., late in the day. Bad weather in the Southwest had delayed
by 24 hours a planned Saturday departure from Edwards.
   Columbia landed in California's Mojave Desert on Aug. 13 after a
five-day secret military mission, which reportedly included
deployment of a spy satellite and experiments related to the Star
Wars anti-missile program.
   Atlantis, which completed a flight in May, was towed out of a
processing hangar into an assembly building Monday to be mated with
an external fuel tank and two solid fuel rockets for an Oct. 12
launch.
   Atlantis' five-member crew is to start the Galileo spacecraft on
a six-year journey to orbit the planet Jupiter and drop a probe into
its atmosphere.
   Columbia, the oldest space shuttle, now will be readied for a
10-day December mission during which the crew of five is to release
a communications satellite and attempt to retrieve a science
satellite the size of a school bus.
   The science satellite, called LDEF for long duration exposure
facility, was launched from another shuttle in 1984 and was to have
been retrieved a year later. But delays, followed by the 1986
explosion of the shuttle Challenger, held up the recovery mission.
   Unusually high solar activity is expanding the atmosphere and
increasing drag on LDEF, raising the possibility it might reenter
the atmosphere and burn up, destroying valuable experiments, before
Columbia's crew can salvage it. As a result, NASA is considering an
earlier launch for the mission.
   In between the Columbia and Atlantis flights, Discovery is to
take off in November on another classified Defense Department
mission.

   Salvage crews today searched for bodies in the
River Thames and in a pleasure boat that sank in a late-night
collision with a barge. Police said 25 people were killed and 38
others unaccounted for.
   Eighty-seven people survived the accident early Sunday under
Southwark Bridge in the heart of London, police said. A Scotland
Yard statement revised an earlier death toll of 27 to 25.
   The tragedy occurred aboard the privately chartered Marchioness,
which had set out on a birthday cruise for 26-year-old businessman
Antonio Vasconcellos. He is among the missing.
   The Scotland Yard statement said the bodies were in a mortuary
undergoing post-mortems, and an inquest would open Wednesday. Police
said 25 launches were scouring the Thames for bodies.
   Police detained the captain and second mate of the Bowbelle
sand-and-gravel dredger and released them overnight. Police said
they would be questioned again today.
   ``We are looking at offenses such as possible unlawful killing
and any related offenses,'' said a police spokeswoman on condition
of anonymity. Unlawful killing is a British charge similar to
manslaughter.
   Authorities also examined taped radio messages to river
navigators for clues into the cause of the accident.
   The Independent, a London daily, reported an apparent
disagreement between the captains of the 90-ton Marchioness and the
1,475-ton Bowbelle over which vessel should pass first under the
bridge's central span.
   The paper also quoted a veteran crewman as saying the Bowbelle
rammed another Thames passenger boat five years ago and nearly sank
it. The Thames is one of the world's busiest commercial rivers, used
by more than 32,000 vessels each year.
   As the tide dropped today, the hull of the 85-foot Marchioness
became fully visible, resting on a mudbank with its top deck sheared
off and its dance floor exposed. Crews had pulled the boat there
from the center of the river where it sank.
   One launch brought families of some victims to the scene to drop
flowers on the water.
   Police said Sunday that the boat, which did not have a passenger
roster, was licensed to carry 149 passengers and two crew. They said
the death toll could be up to 60.
   The Marchioness sank within minutes and carried underwater scores
of revelers who were drinking and dancing below deck.
   British journalist Nicholas Hastings, who was attending the
party, survived the sinking.
   ``Suddenly there was a small jolt. Somebody screamed,'' he said.
``The first thing that ran through my mind was that we had hit
something in the river. But as I turned around I could see the
emormous, looming hull of the dredger that had hit us. It was right
on top of us.''
   Among the missing too was the riverboat captain. The party-goers,
many in their teens and twenties, included friends of the
Portuguese-born Vasconcellos and figures from the worlds of
modeling, photography and finance.
   Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson cut short a Florida vacation
and returned to London today to head the investigation.
   The Independent, quoting unidentified river authority sources,
said the last radio conversation between the captains ``was a
discussion as to which should pass through the central span of
Southwark Bridge. ... It appears there may have been a
disagreement.''
   Only vessels as big as the 260-foot Bowbelle, one of the largest
registered on the Thames, have right of way through the central
arches of the river's bridges, and pleasure craft should keep to the
second or third arches near the bank, the newspaper said, quoting a
Port of London Authority source.
   Pleasure craft ``are bloody awful on the river. They continually
cut corners to save a few minutes,'' it quoted the unidentified
source as saying.
   It also quoted a former river boat engineer, Gerald Hastings, as
saying he was on the Pride of Greenwich when the Bowbelle rammed it
from behind under Charing Cross Bridge in 1984.
   The collision left a 3-foot dent in the stern and an inquiry
equally apportioned blame, the newspaper said.
   ``We got no message from the Bowbelle,'' Hastings was quoted as
saying. ``I believe that they did not have a lookout when they hit
us.''
   In 1878, the paddle-steamer Princess Alice was sliced in two by a
coal barge on the Thames in southeast London. It sank within five
minutes, killing an estimated 700 people.

   Japan arrested more than 2,700 foreigners, mostly
from Bangladesh and Pakistan, this spring for working or living in
Japan illegally, the Justice Ministry said.
   Police and immigration authorities arrested 2,705 foreigners in
Tokyo, Osaka and Nagoya between May 29 and June 17, said a ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said 308 other
foreigners surrendered voluntarily to police.
   Japan has deported 3,013 foreigners, including 749 Bangladeshis,
664 Pakistanis, 422 South Koreans, 360 Filipinos, 177 Malysians, 113
Thais, 77 Chinese, including Taiwanese, 66 Indians, 17 Ghanaians and
14 Nigerians.
   In 1988, Japan arrested and deported 17,854 foreigners, he said.
The total was up 26.4 percent from 1987, he added.

   John F. Kennedy Jr. took the subway his first day
on the job Monday as an assistant district attorney and told
pestering reporters his goal was ``to get through the day.''
   The 28-year-old son of the late President Kennedy, and People
magazine's ``Sexiest Man Alive,'' rolled his eyes as he saw more
than 40 reporters, photographers and TV crew members waiting when he
arrived to be sworn in as one of 69 new assistants to Manhattan
District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
   ``I felt more relaxed until I saw you guys,'' said Kennedy.
   His preparation for the day: ``I had breakfast.'' His reaction to
the media horde: ``I think it'll pass.''
   Kennedy, who graduated from New York University Law School in May
and took the bar exam last month, was assigned to the Special
Prosecutions Bureau, which handles low-level civic corruption.
   His salary will be $30,000 a year; if he passes the bar, he'll
get $1,000 more. When asked why he didn't go into more lucrative
private practice, Kennedy said, ``It's a great place to work.''

   Not everyone attending Willie Nelson's concert was
there just to hear the music. Two Georgia farmers also wanted to
shake his hand.
   ``I would like to thank Mr. Nelson for his help because without
him I wouldn't be farming,'' said Frederick J. Hall of Newton, who
along with Carl R. Whitehead of Unadilla met briefly with Nelson
backstage before the Sunday night concert at Chastain Park.
   Nelson is president of Farm Aid Inc., a non-profit organization
that has raised $10 million over the last four years for needy

   Oakland Athletics slugger Jose Canseco has
gotten in trouble with the law again over his car, this time because
the windows in his Porsche were too dark.
   Canseco was cited for the darkened windows, not carrying a
driver's license and having no proof of auto insurance.
   ``You can see inside,'' he said of the windows. ``They were that
way when I bought the car.''
   The incident Saturday marked the third time the 24-year-old
Canseco has been cited for not carrying his license and was one of a
series of tickets and one arrest since being named the American
League's Most Valuable Player last year.
   He was arrested in San Francisco April 21 after a passer-by
noticed a fully loaded, semi-automatic pistol on the floor of his
parked Jaguar.
   His lawyer said Canseco plans to plead no contest in that case to
a misdemeanor weapons charge in exchange for probation and community
service.

   Oprah Winfrey is probably the richest woman on
television, with an annual income of $40 million and a production
company worth about $250 million, says TV Guide magazine.
   Miss Winfrey, 35, has ``become so valuable to King World
(syndicator of her show) that a Wall Street analyst estimated the
company maintains a $50 to $70 million insurance policy on her
life,'' the magazine said in its Aug. 26 edition.
   The next seven richest were Marcy Carsey, Mary Tyler Moore, Agnes
Nixon, Esther Shapiro, Susan Harris, Carol Burnett and Joan Rivers.
The wealth ratings were based on public documents, reports and
interviews, TV Guide said.
   All eight women are producers, owners or creators of shows with
the exception of Ms. Rivers, whose $30 million worth was said to
come from real estate.
   Miss Winfrey stars in, owns and produces ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show,'' is co-owner of a Chicago television and movie studio, part
owner of three television stations, a partner in a Chicago
restaurant and owns a 160-acre farm in Indiana.

<HEAD>Deficit Trend May Require Automatic Budget Cuts, Administration Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bush administration budget officials said today
that the federal deficit is on a path that, if not corrected, would
require $16.2 billion in automatic spending cuts during the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1.
   However, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management
and Budget, said the automatic cuts can be avoided if Congress fully
implements a budget agreement reached with the administration in
April.
   ``It remains my hope, and my cautiously optimistic expectation,
that necessary legislation may be enacted prior to'' Oct. 1 that
would cut the deficit to the maximum $100 billion level specified by
the Gramm-Rudman balanced-budget law, Darman said in a letter to
President Bush.
   Darman expressed that hope as his office made public a report
gauging progress made in reducing the deficit. ``We are cutting it
very close,'' he said.
   That report projects a deficit of $116.2 billion in the 1990
fiscal year. The Gramm-Rudman law limits the deficit to $100 billion
in that year but allows a $10 billion cushion before requiring
across-the-board spending cuts. However, once spending cuts are
triggered, the full $16.2 billion reduction would be required.
   Those automatic cuts, known in Washington jargon as
``sequestration,'' would require a 5.3 percent reduction in most
non-defense spending _ but not Social Security benefits, for example
_ and a 4.3 percent cut in military spending.
   The OMB report spelled out in detail how programs might be
affected by the arbitrary cuts.
   For example, it said, cuts could undermine the ability of the
Drug Enforcement Administration to fight illegal drugs;
significantly hamper efforts by the Public Health Service to prevent
the spread of AIDS; require furlough of Federal Aviation
Administration personnel for three days a month; and reduce grants
for needy college students by $1 billion below the level recommended
by the Department of Education.
   The OMB forecast is based on economic projections that are more
optimistic than those used by the Congressional Budget Office. CBO
said last week that deficit-reduction efforts enacted so far would
leave $141.5 billion of red ink in 1990 _ $25 billion above the OMB
estimate.
   Most of that gap is accounted for by the differing assumptions
about economic growth and inflation, plus technical differences on
how the recently enacted bailout for the savings and loan industry
will be implemented.

<TEXT>
   Beirut's battered horse track, frequented
by Christans and Moslems, is one of the few signs of unity in a
nation wracked by bloodshed.
   Old-timers say that when the mile-long circular track goes, it
will mean the end of Lebanon as a state.
   The racetrack, which is called the Palace of Peace and sits in
the no-man's land along Beirut's dividing Green Line, was until
recently still used for occasional private race meetings.
   In the summer of 1988, which was relatively quiet, there were
racing sessions every fortnight, with up to $1 million being
wagered. That encouraged the track committee to repair the
war-damaged gates, stands and betting counters, and set March 13
this year for reopening it to the public.
   But five days before the scheduled opening, fighting erupted
between Christian troops and the Syrian army. The track came under
fierce bombardment, trapping 40 Arabian horses in their stables.
   For nine days, trainers and stable hands tried in vain to reach
them from both sides of the Green Line that splits Beirut into
Moslem and Christian sectors.
   ``When we finally made it, we found two horses fatally wounded by
shrapnel and six dead in their boxes from thirst and hunger,'' said
trainer Sami Dabbour, a Moslem.
   He said the other 32 horses were barely able to stand when
rescuers got to them during a lull last week.
   ``We fed them and watered them and then got them out to safer
stables in west Beirut. I have 10 in my stables and they're doing
fine now,'' Dabbour added.
   Nearly 500 other Arabian horses, worth an estimated $2 million,
were brought out during previous lulls.
   In the old days, up to 10,000 people used to gather at the track,
founded in 1916 during Ottoman rule, every weekend for races.
Politics were never discussed.
   When the civil war broke out in April 1975, the track and its
stands were seriously damaged and it was closed for two years.
   It was reopened in 1977, after the Syrian army intervened to
snuff out the fighting, even though snipers from both sides still
fired from shell-pocked apartment buildings overlooking the track.
   The first race that year was won by a white Arabian named Simsam
_ Arabic for sword _ its neck in bandages because of a gunshot
wounded.
   His Moslem owner, Azmi Ghazi, was hugged and kissed by jubilant
Christians who had bet on his horse.
   The track repeatedly was caught in the crossfire after that. In
1979, when it was open for a while, gunmen opened up on the horses
lined up for the Christmas prize race, then raked the crowded
stands, wounding three spectators.
   When the Israeli Army invaded Lebanon in 1982, 120 horses were
killed and most of the surrounfing pine woods set on fire in the
fighting.
   Races resumed late in 1983. At the New Year's Day race in 1984,
one horse collapsed on the course, bringing down the four favorites.
A 92-1 longshot named Commodore romped home, causing an uproar.
   The committee canceled the result. One man, who had bet heavily
on Commodore, stormed off shouting threats. Minutes later a
rocket-propelled grenade hit the committee's glassed-in,
air-conditioned tower. No one was hurt.
   On Feb. 21, 1985, a militia commander fired three grenades in the
air over the stands because the committee refused to pay protection
money.

   First lady Barbara Bush, still
experiencing eye problems from a thyroid condition, will return to
Washington on Tuesday for a checkup, the White House said Monday.
   Mrs. Bush, vacationing here with the president through Labor Day,
was to fly to Washington Tuesday morning for a midday appointment at
Walter Reed Army Hospital, said presidential spokesman Marlin
Fitzwater.
   The first lady suffers from Graves disease, a thyroid imbalance
diagnosed earlier this year. A side effect of the disorder is eye
irritation.
   Although she has undergone treatment for the problem, including
radioactive iodine to shrink the thyroid, she continues to be
troubled by the affliction.
   In an interview last week with the Boston Globe, Mrs. Bush said
that she suffers from some double vision.
   ``I've been putting off treatment for it, but I'm going to do
something about it this fall,'' she told the Globe.
   Fitzwater said ``her eyes have been giving her trouble'' during
the Maine vacation.

<HEAD>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Walesa warning to Communists.
Pick up 7th pvs, `President Wojciech...'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Solidarity chief Lech Walesa today warned
the Communist Party to moderate its demands for more seats in the
new Solidarity-led Cabinet or ``it will lose everything.''
   The Communist Party Central Committee, in a resolution published
late Sunday, said it should be given an amount of seats in the
government of Prime Minister-designate Tadeusz Mazowiecki that
``correspond to its state and political potential.''
   While not mentioning a specific number, it was clear from the
resolution that the party wants more than just the defense and
interior portfolios offered so far by Solidarity.
   ``They should not fight for keeping their posts anymore,'' Walesa
said today in an interview with The Associated Press in Gdansk. He
urged the party to ``understand what these times mean.''
   ``If they play the fool they can lose even more. They will be
rejected,'' he said.
   The Solidarity chairman said Mazowiecki might offer additional
seats to the Communists because the government will need ``wise
people.'' But he said the movement would not buckle if the party
tried to take those offices ``by force.''
   ``We need reforms ... If the party does not understand that, and
starts provocations and only provoking _ and they are now _ then it
will lose everything,'' Walesa said.
   In an interview in the party newspaper Trybuna Ludu, First
Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski said he is looking for ways to
``strengthen the powers of the party.''
   ``Hundreds of thousands of our comrades are waiting today all
over Poland for the voice of their Central Committee on the issues
most significant, not only for the party, but for the whole
country,'' Rakowski said.
   ``Do we capitulate or charge forward? Do we resign from the
values of socialism or are we ready to defend them?'' he said.
   Journalist Daniel Passent, editor of Rakowski's former
party-linked newspaper Polityka, said in an interview today with the
British Broadcasting Corp. That the party probably would ask for the
powerful ministries of foreign affairs and finance, in addition ot
defense and internal affairs.
   Mazowiecki said in Gdansk Sunday he has made no final decision on
the makeup of his government but that it would be open to reform
forces from all parties.
   President Wojciech Jaruzelski issued an announcement Saturday
that he intended to nominate Mazowiecki, a longtime Solidarity
journalist and adviser to Lech Walesa, to head the East bloc's first
non-communist government.
   A spokeswoman for Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz confirmed
today that the Sejm has received Jaruzelski's nominating letter. The
appointment of Mazowiecki would be added to Wednesday's agenda of
the Sejm, the lower parliament chamber, the spokeswoman said.
   He said a Central Committee resolution, in which it threatened to
withhold support from the government if it does not receive enough
Cabinet seats, answers the expectations of the part of the party
``which does not want to put up their hands'' in surrender.
   The communist Central Committee demanded in a resolution
published late Sunday that it be given an amount of seats in the
Mazowiecki government that ``correspond to its state and political
potential.''
   ``Otherwise we will not be able to take responsibility for the
course of developments,'' the party said in the resolution adopted
at its meeting Saturday and released by the state PAP news service.
   ``Our support for the new government is conditioned on reaching
agreement on its program platform and political structure,'' it
said. It said it also wanted the assurances before Mazowiecki's
appointment.
   Solidarity, the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party
have enough votes in Parliament to elect Mazowiecki even without
communist support. But deciding how to handle the party's objections
will be the first delicate problem of his government.
   The party resolution was critical of the Peasants and Democrats
for switching allegiance to the Solidarity candidate, and accused
Solidarity of breaking the spring's ``round-table'' accords _ which
did not anticipate such a rapid switchover in power.
   It said neither of the country's main political forces, the
Communists or Solidarity, ``can independently _ or even more,
against one another _ face the dangers and pull the country out of
collapse.''
   To its former coalition partners, the party said they might
``bear the burden of historical responsibility'' for switching
allegiances to Solidarity.
   Mazowiecki, in the Baltic port of Gdansk on Sunday for his first
public rally since being nominated, met with Solidarity chief Lech
Walesa and other leaders of the independent movement to begin
planning the government.
   Mazowiecki expects to decide by the end of the month how the
government ministries will be divided among Solidarity, two newly
allied minor parties and the communists, his acting spokesman said.
   ``To lift up the country you need a broad government formula ...
A government open to all forces represented in parliament,''
Mazowiecki said in an interview for publication today in the
opposition's Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper.
   But as to which party would get which ministries in his cabinet,
he said he has not decided. ``I cannot act hastily,'' he told the
paper.

   Thirty-two alligators were killed
and left to rot on the west side of Lake Okeechobee in what may have
been a vendetta against a state game officer, wildlife officials say.
   Poaching was not the motive because the reptiles' valuable hides
and tails _ containing choice meat _ were left intact, they say.
   No arrests have been made in the gator killings, a third-degree
felony punishable by up to five years in jail and a $5,000 fine.
Except during brief special hunting seasons, only wildlife officers
and the state's 46 licensed nuisance-alligator trappers are
authorized to kill the animals in the wild.
   Capt. James R. Doxey, of the Florida Game and Fresh Water Fish
Commission, said the shooting spree two weeks ago may have been a
result of someone's anger over a poaching arrest, because at least
one clue was left.
   One gator was dangling from a pole and spray-painted on its
carcass was the name of a wildlife officer who patrols the
700,000-acre lake.
   Wildlife officers occasionally find one or two gators shot, ``but
never on a scale like this,'' said Lindsey Hord, the game
commission's South Florida Alligator Program coordinator.
   ``It was just wanton destruction. There is absolutely no
justification for shooting that many gators,'' he said.
   Alligators generally steer clear of humans, but there have been
several instances of them attacking and killing or wounding people.
   Despite that danger, wildlife officers say they still run across
evidence of gator abuse not necessarily related to poaching,
including bullet-riddled carcasses floating in canals and live
gators swimming around with protruding darts or arrows.
   Mike Rafferty, a nuisance gator trapper in Palm City, said he has
seen people with guns using gators for target practice.
   ``Alligators are not an attractive species to most people. They
are not furry when they are young,'' said Mike Jennings, an
alligator biologist with the game commission.
   The game commission made 227 arrests statewide for alligator
violations _ including poaching _ from July 1988 to July of this
year, said Maj. Jim Ries of the commission.
   Lt. Dick Lawrence, who supervises the game commission's regional
nuisance gator trapping program, recalled a case last year in which
two men were arrested for dropping concrete blocks on a gator's
head. The gator was under a bridge and not threatening anyone.
   ``We ended up going down and killing the gator because he was so
badly injured,'' Lawrence said.
   Fishing guides have been known to shoot gators and large birds
that might threaten a customer's catch, wildlife officials said. And
cattle growers have killed alligators on their ranches because of
the threat to calves, Doxey said.

   A smoke bomb mailed to NAACP regional headquarters
went off today when the package was opened, filling the office with
fumes and slightly injuring eight people, officials said.
   Earl T. Shinhoster, executive director of the Southeastern
regional office of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, said he and his secretary opened a package ``no
bigger than a hatbox'' about 12:25 p.m. and immediately saw sparks
and a cylinder emitting a yellowish, caustic smoke.
   Atlanta police earlier reported that a fire, possibly caused by a
bomb, had broken out at the building, but Shinhoster said there were
no flames.
   Eight people were taken to hospitals suffering discomfort from
the smoke, Shinhoster said. He said his own eyes and nose were
burned by the smoke, but he wasn't seriously injured.
   Shinhoster said the smoke filled the two-story office building
near the Atlanta University Center campus in less than two minutes.
   ``This is a very evil and dastardly act,'' he said. ``I don't
know why anyone would want to try to hurt innocent people like
this.''
   Shinhoster said the package, delivered via the U.S. Postal
Service's priority mail about 11:30 a.m., was addressed to the NAACP
office, but to no one in particular. He said he believed the return
address was in Atlanta.
   Assistant Fire Chief Walter Campbell said the gas was similar to
tear gas. The package remained largely intact and was being looked
at by investigators, he said.
   Police and fire crews cordoned off a block of Martin Luther King
Jr. Drive around the building.
   Only Shinhoster and his secretary were in the NAACP office at the
time, but the building's air conditioning system rapidly took the
gas throughout the two-story brick office building, Campbell said.
Some of the other offices in the building are medical offices.
   Among the eight people taken to the hospital were two children
ages 4 and 12 who were in the building, he said. Shinhoster did not
immediately seek medical treatment.
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., said he was in the neighborhood
speaking to a community group when he heard about the incident and
rushed to the scene.
   ``Anytime something like this would come to the NAACP office, you
have to believe it's racially motivated,'' Lewis said. ``I think
there's a climate existing in America now. Twenty-five years later
(after the civil rights movement) the seeds of racism are raising
their ugly heads again.
   ``On the one hand, I'm surprised and shocked this could happen in
1989, but on the other hand I'm not,'' he said.

   The Federal Reserve Board ruled Monday that
Japanese firms may continue to fully participate in the market for
U.S. government securities despite lingering concerns that U.S.
companies face discrimination in Japan.
   By a 5-1 vote, the board approved a report from its staff that
found Japan had made ``much progress'' in opening its government
debt market to foreign firms.
   Consequently, the United States should continue to permit
Japanese-owned firms to operate as ``primary dealers'' in Treasury
securities, the central bank ruled.
   Although any firm may buy Treasury debt, only 42 are designated
by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as primary dealers, eligible
to trade securities with the central bank as part of its regulation
of the economy.
   Omnibus trade legislation passed by Congress a year ago required
the Federal Reserve to remove foreign-owned firms from the primary
dealer list if their nations did not afford ``the same competitive
opportunities'' to U.S. firms.
   The United States runs a persistent deficit with Japan in the
trade of goods. One of the ways it makes up part of that gap is
through the trade of services such as those offered by securities
firms.
   Legislators warned that unless the United States insists on full
access to Japanese financial markets, the U.S. brokerage industry
will slip behind in international competition, just as U.S. auto and
steel firms have.
   The Federal Reserve staff conceded the barriers to U.S.
participation in Japanese government debt markets had existed, but
noted substantial improvement.
   It specifically noted a decision by Japan this April to sell 40
percent of its 10-year bonds, the most important government security
issued, through a competitive auction, leaving 60 percent to be sold
through negotiation with a syndicate of securities companies and
banks.
   Previously all 10-year bonds had been sold through the syndicate.
The staff also noted that foreign participation in the syndicate has
increased from about 1 percent in 1986 to 8 percent last year.
   ``Much progress has been made. ... The structure of the market
now compares favorably with the state of development in other
industrial countries, and the actions that have been taken in recent
years to open the market are substantial,'' the staff wrote.
   However, it added, ``Federal Reserve officials (should) continue
to take every opportunity to urge Japan to liberalize its markets
further and to improve further the openness of competition among
market participants.''
   Board member Martha Seger dissented, noting that the law requires
Japan to offer ``the same competitive opportunities,'' not simply to
improve.
   In particular, U.S. firms still complain that Japanese officials
provide advance information to Japanese firms on government economic
data, putting other firms at a disadvantage. However, the central
bank staff said that the Japanese have taken steps to curb this
abuse and that ``further steps are expected.''

<HEAD>Black Activists in Hiding As Police Continue Crackdown</HEAD>

   Prominent black activists went
into hiding as police on Monday continued to crack down on a
campaign to defy apartheid laws and emergency restrictions.
   Students at three Natal province universities defied police
banning orders and held rallies to declare outlawed student
organizations would operate openly. Eight students were held briefly
and six were charged with attending illegal gatherings.
   Several hundred sturdents at each university clashed with police
who came to the campuses to halt the rallies, part of a national
campaign to disregard banning orders placed on organizations during
the 3-year-old national emergency.
   Police fired tear gas and turned a water cannon on students and
staff at the multiracial University of Natal-Durban, after a crowd
of more than 1,000 refused several orders to disperse. A student
leader shouting over a megaphone declared the End Conscription
Campaign and the South African National Students Congress
``unbanned'' as he ran from squads of police scattering the crowd.
   Students at the white University of Natal-Pietermaritzburg
encountered police when they marched off-campus with placards
proclaiming the two organizations ``unbanned.'' Police also
disrupted a rally at the mostly-Indian University of
Durban-Westville, where students danced and chanted in celebration
of the ``unbanning.''
   ``The past few days have been marked by a systematic pattern of
repression by the state against the defiance campaign,'' said Cas
Coovadia of the banned United Democratic Front, the country's
largest opposition coalition.
   ``The detention of our leaders and the banning of our meetings
serves to strengthen our spirit of resistance,'' Coovadia said in a
statement. He added that he had gone into hiding, but did not name
any others who had done so.
   There have been reports of several activists dissapearing since
Friday when police arrested Mohhamed Valli Moosa, the acting
secretary-general of the United Democratic Front and a chief
organizer of the defiance campaign. He was held under emergency
regulations that allow police to keep him in custody infefinitely
without charge.
   Leon Mellet, spokesman for the Law and Order Ministry, indirectly
confirmed that activists were hiding. ``It is ironic that they unban
themselves and then immediately go underground,'' he said.
   He said ``a number'' of people who had defied the law had been
arrested and ``when they sit alone in a police cell, they must blame
those faceless people who irresponsibly urged them to defy the law.''
   The defiance campaign which began Aug. 2 has been escalating in
the days leading up to Sept. 6 parliamentary elections that exclude
the 28 million-member black majority.
   Police responded by breaking up several weekend anti-apartheid
rallies, including a march by blacks at a ``whites-only'' beach at
Cape Town and a demonstration at the University of the Witwatersrand
in Johannesburg. The chairman of the Johannesburg rally said major
speakers from the UDF had not arrived Sunday because they were in
hiding.
   Police said an ``unsatisfactorily high'' number of unrest
incidents had occurred over the weekend in the Cape Town area, and
that police would continue to use whatever action neccessary to curb
such protests.
   Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu condemned the police use of
whips, dogs, and tear gas to keep blacks off the beaches Saturday.
   ``In my experience it is the police who have been creating
`unrest.' Whenever they keep away from an event, it goes off
peacefully. Whenever they arrive with their quirts, tear gas and
firearms and try to prevent people from peacefully expressing their
dissent, they precipitate confrontation and violence,'' he said.

   Steam service, interrupted when a high-pressure
steam pipe exploded beneath a street and killed three people, was
restored Monday to the Gramercy Park South neighborhood.
   Consolidated Edison Co. said it still was not sure what caused
the blast that released a scalding, roaring jet of steam on the
sedate residential block. It threw mud and chunks of pavement out
from a 20-foot-deep crater and broke windows.
   The power company's steam, piped at 400 degrees under pressure of
150 pounds per inch, heats buildings in winter and powers air
conditioners in summer.
   Utility spokeswoman Pat Richardi but she had no estimate of how
long it would take to repair the street and reopen it to traffic.
   Con Edison has said one possible explanation for the explosion
could be that cold water from a nearby leaking pipe hit the hot,
steel steam line and caused a stress fracture that blew open an
expansion joint.
   ``We don't even have all the pieces yet,'' Ms. Richardi said.
   She said the steam main dated from 1952, and the expansion joint,
which was stainless steel or a steel alloy, was installed in 1968.
   Before the blast, a Con Edison crew had closed off the steam line
while a city crew repaired the water leak and pumped water out of
utility tunnels beneath the street. The utility crew then turned the
steam back on and the explosion ripped open the street.
   One woman was killed while she napped in her third-floor
apartment in the building nearest the blast. Two Con Edison
employees working at the scene also were killed. Two other utility
employees were hospitalized with burns.

   A small federal courtroom became the stage
today for the latest episode in the Jim Bakker story _ his trial on
charges he cheated his PTL ministry out of $4 million to finance a
lavish lifestyle.
   ``Our faith is in God,'' Bakker proclaimed as he arrived at the
courthouse accompanied by his daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, and
attorney George T. Davis. ``I'm glad to have my daughter with me.''
   The television evangelist, ousted from his PTL empire two years
ago, entered the courthouse and said nothing more to reporters
waiting outside.
   About 70 potential jurors were on hand as the selection got under
way. No one was seated this morning. U.S. District Court Judge
Robert Potter dismissed four potential jurors, two who said they had
opinions they couldn't overcome in the case, one who was a diabetic
and one who was excused because of unspecified business reasons.
   Potter told the jury pool there had been ``a lot of publicity
about this case'' and asked jurors if they ``would be willing to
have yourself convicted based on publicity.''
   ``What I'm trying to do is get you to put yourself in the place
of the defendant, who has had a lot of publicity in this case,''
Potter added. ``It makes our job very difficult to find a jury.''
   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of
wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. If
convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in
prison and fined more than $5 million.
   As the trial opened, Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye Bakker, stayed in
Orlando, Fla., where Bakker transplanted his ministry, to carry on
their daily live broadcast.
   Mrs. Bakker opened the ``Jim and Tammy Show'' this morning with
tears and exhorted listeners to pray for her husband.
   ``We have such trouble things going on in Charlotte, N.C.,
today,'' Mrs. Bakker said. It's like a circus in Charlotte, N.C. I
don't know how possibly Jim can get a fair trial in Charlotte,
N.C.'' His attorneys have been pressing for a change of venue.
   She blew a kiss on the air and said, ``I love you, sweetheart.
Don't you dare give up.''
   ``Not only is Jim on trial, people, but the church that we know
is on trial,'' Mrs. Bakker said. ``Everything that has to do with
Christian television is on trial when Jim walks in that courtroom.''
   Outside the fortress-like granite courthouse, there were no
Bakker supporters in sight. There were no Bakker detractors, either.
   But there was 22-year-old Michael Williams, a former PTL
supporter and lunch truck operator who said he was there to ``get a
little bit of my money back'' by selling coffee and breakfast
biscuits to journalists and passers-by.
   Opening arguments were scheduled to begin in a week, but defense
attorneys have renewed their motions to move the trial out of
Charlotte and the Western District of North Carolina because of
pretrial publicity.
   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor rejected a similar motion earlier,
saying publicity had died down in the two years since Bakker left
the PTL ministry he founded. But Taylor said lawyers could renew
their arguments before U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter
during jury selection.
   Bakker is charged with eight counts of mail fraud, 15 counts of
wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud. If
convicted on all counts, he could be sentenced to 120 years in
prison and ordered to pay more than $5 million in fines. Mrs. Bakker
isn't charged.
   Bakker and his attorneys have declined to discuss their defense
strategy.
   But the evangelist has said he knew little about PTL's finances.
``I was a pastor, and a businessman I was not.''
   Bakker, who left the PTL television empire during a sex-and-money
scandal in 1987, relocated earlier this year to a nearly empty
shopping center in Orlando. The show is carried by several
television stations.
   The Bakkers have asked viewers to contribute $1 million for a
defense fund. In a letter to supporters two months ago, Mrs. Bakker
said half of that amount had to be raised by the end of the month.
   Officials of Jim and Tammy Ministries have declined to say how
much has been raised, except to say that supporters have responded
to the appeal.
   It was earlier appeals for $1,000 donations to buy ``lifetime
partnerships'' at PTL that landed Bakker in federal court.
   Prosecutors say he and top aides diverted more than $4 million of
the $158 million contributed under various partnership programs to
their personal uses.
   In eight of the 11 partnerships, contributors were promised free
lodging at the ministry's Heritage USA Christian retreat and theme
park at Fort Mill, S.C., in exchange for their one-time donation of
$1,000.
   But investigators say donations were spent on the ministry's
day-to-day operating costs and to finance the lavish lifestyles of
PTL executives rather than the mammoth hotel projects Bakker
promoted on his television show.
   Richard Dortch, Bakker's former top assistant at the now-defunct
PTL, pleaded guilty to four charges of fraud and conspiracy Aug. 8
and agreed to testify against his former boss.
   The trial is expected to focus on the Bakkers' lifestyle, much
like the trial of James and David Taggart, two former aides who were
convicted last month of income tax evasion. The two brothers, who
face up to 25 years in prison and $1 million in fines each, are
scheduled to be sentenced Friday.
   They were convicted of diverting $1.1 million in ministry funds
to finance European trips, fur coats, matching Jaguar cars, Cartier
jewelry, expensive furniture and an apartment in Manhattan's Trump
Tower.
   Bakker resigned in March 1987 after The Charlotte Observer
informed him it was ready to publish a story saying the ministry
paid hush money to prevent former New York church secretary Jessica
Hahn from talking about her 1980 tryst with Bakker.
   Bakker turned the ministry over to the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who
put PTL under bankruptcy protection three months later after his
staff discovered alleged financial irregularities and millions of
dollars in debts.
   Potter told potential jurors that a number of people were
potential witnesses, including Dortch; former PTL board member Efrem
Zimbalist Jr., an actor; the Taggarts; and Mrs. Bakker. Neither Ms.
Hahn or Falwell was mentioned.

   Bandits killed conservationist George
Adamson near his bush camp, the government said Monday, nine years
years after the violent death of his wife, Joy, who wrote the
touching story of Elsa the lioness in ``Born Free.''
   Adamson, 83, was slain when Somali bandits who attacked three of
his assistants opened fire on his vehicle with automatic weapons as
he tried to run them down, said Richard Leakey, Kenya's director of
wildlife. Two of his assistants also were killed.
   The Adamsons helped popularize wildlife conservation. Joy Adamson
propelled them to fame with the books ``Born Free,'' ``Living Free''
and ``Forever Free,'' describing their practice of taking lions born
in captivity, teaching them to survive and releasing them into the
wild.
   She was killed by a servant in a wage dispute in 1980.
   Adamson died Sunday near his camp in the remote Kora National
Reserve of northeastern Kenya, where he helped dozens of lions learn
to survive in the bush.
   Leakey said Monday three of the British conservationist's
assistants had set off for a nearby airstrip to pick up guests the
conservationist expected for lunch.
   Three Somalis forced the assistants to stop by shooting out their
tires, then robbed the men and beat one of them with an iron bar,
breaking his legs, Leakey said.
   The shots could be heard in Adamson's camp about a mile away and
he went to investigate, with three other assistants. As they
approached the scene, an assistant armed with a rifle urged Adamson
to stop the vehicle, but he decided to attack instead.
   ``He put his foot on the accelerator and drove straight into the
bandits and a hail of bullets,'' said Leakey, who went to Kora on
Monday to investigate the killing with Philip Kilonzo, the police
commissioner. ``It was a tremendous show of bravery.''
   He said Adamson and two assistants were killed, but the man with
the rifle survived by jumping out when he realized Adamson did not
plan to stop.
   Leakey said the man who was beaten identified the attackers by
their speech as Somalis and heard them tell each other to shoot to
kill. He said 150 security personnel had been sent to the area and
an 80-mile radius around Adamson's camp was sealed off.
   He said Adamson would be buried with honors at Kora by the Kenyan
government.
   In London, the naturalist and filmmaker David Attenborough said
the death of Adamson was ``very, very tragic news.''
   ``George Adamson was an extraordinary man, absolutely
extraordinary,'' said Attenborough, who made a program about Elsa
and her cubs. ``He became very attached to the lions. He was
prepared to stand up for them against anybody and anything. Clearly,
that wasn't always popular.''
   Kenyan officials had been concerned about attacks by Somali
tribesmen, known as Shifta, since a major anti-poaching effort
pushed most of them out of Kenya's game reserves, Leakey said.
   He said Adamson refused additional protection and did not want to
leave Kora, where he felt protected by his 16 lions and more than
half a dozen assistants.
   It was largely because of agitation by Adamson, who moved to Kora
in 1971, that the government made it a game reserve three years
later.
   Encroachment by nomadic Somalis and their herds led Adamson to
pressure officials into sending the anti-poaching troops to remove
them.
   In an interview with The Associated Press in 1983, Adamson said
he had been told of a plot by Somalis to murder him in hopes that,
with him gone, there would be little pressure on the government to
police the reserve.
   Leakey said authorities believed the motive of Sunday's attack
was robbery, not murder.
   Adamson was born in India in 1906. He first visited Kenya in 1924
and later moved to the East African nation, joining its game
department in 1938. He retired in 1963.
   When he married Joy, an Austrian artist, in 1944, he was game
warden of Kenya's Northern Frontier District
   Twelve years later, he brought home three motherless lion cubs.
The one they called Elsa became the central character of ``Born
Free.''
   The Adamsons, who had no children, separated and she moved to the
Shaba game reserve in the late 1960s to work with leopards. She was
killed there in 1980.
   Adamson, whose shoulder-length flaxen hair and goatee made him
resemble his beloved lions, lived in the modest camp at Kora on a
pension, interest from a trust Joy established and donations from
admirers.
   He wrote two books, ``Bwana Game'' and an autobiography, ``My
Pride and Joy.''

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa warned the
Communist Party on Monday not to demand too much of a role in the
new government, or it ``could lose everything.''
   ``If they play the fool they can lose even more,'' Walesa said in
an interview with The Associated Press at union headquarters in
Gdansk. ``They will be rejected.''
   The Communist Party Central Committee, in a resolution published
late Sunday, said it would not support the prime minister-designate,
Solidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki, unless it was given a number
of government posts that ``correspond to its state and political
potential.''
   The party did not specify how many or what posts it demanded. But
the resolution made clear the Communists want more than just the
defense and interior portfolios _ posts Solidarity already has
offered them.
   Walesa insisted the Communists ``should not fight for keeping
their posts anymore.'' Rather, he said, they must ``abandon threats
and blackmail'' and earn public support by instituting needed
reforms.
   ``We need reforms. ... If the party does not understand that, and
starts provocations ... then it will lose everything,'' Walesa said.
   Walesa said Mazowiecki might, in the end, offer additional seats
to the communists because the government will need ``wise people.''
But he said Solidarity would not submit if the party tried to take
those offices ``by force.''
   Mazowiecki, charged with the delicate task of forming a
government, took a less confrontational approach in an interview
with state radio.
   ``I think we should be mutually open to each other and aim at a
situation that no relations of ... aggression take place between
us,'' he said.
   Mazowiecki was nominated Saturday by President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, who said he made the decision in order to start Poland
on the road of economic and social repair.
   The nomination of a Solidarity leader was made possible when
Walesa engineered a coalition between the union and two small
parties that previously had been allied with the Communists.
   The Communist candidate for prime minister, Czeslaw Kiszczek, was
forced to resign after Solidarity said it would not support his
government.
   The recent developments marked a once-inconceivable victory for
Solidarity, which was crushed in 1981 when Jaruzelski imposed
martial law, and banned the next year. Mazowiecki himself was jailed
for a year.
   Mazowiecki met Monday with various political leaders in Warsaw,
including Peasant Party leader Aleksander Bentkowski. The party is
one of Solidarity's two coalition partners.
   Communist First Secretary Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, meanwhile, met
Jaruzelski to discuss the political situation and the weekend
communist plenum.
   In an interview in the party newspaper Trybuna Ludu on Monday,
Rakowski said he is looking for ways to ``strengthen the powers of
the party.''
   ``Hundreds of thousands of our comrades are waiting today all
over Poland for the voice of their Central Committee on the issues
most significant, not only for the party, but for the whole
country,'' he said.
   ``Do we capitulate or charge forward? Do we resign from the
values of socialism or are we ready to defend them?''
   He said the Central Committee resolution reflects the feelings of
those in the party who do ``not want to put up their hands'' in
surrender.
   Daniel Passent, editor of Rakowski's former newspaper, the
party-linked Polityka, told the BBC that the party probably would
ask for the powerful ministries of foreign affairs and finance in
addition to defense and interior, which oversee the army and police.
   Mazowiecki said Sunday he has made no final decision on the
makeup of his government but that it would be open to pro-reform
forces from all parties.
   Mazowiecki's nomination must be approved by the Sejm, the lower
house of the National Assembly. Sejm Speaker Mikolaj Kozakiewicz
confirmed Monday that the Sejm had received the nomination and it
would be considered Wednesday.
   Solidarity, the United Peasant Party and the Democratic Party
have enough Sejm votes to elect Mazowiecki without Communist support.
   The Communist resolution was critical of the two smaller parties
for switching allegiance to Solidarity, and accused Solidarity of
breaking the ``round-table'' accords of the past spring, which did
not anticipate such a rapid switchover in power.
   It warned Solidarity that it was taking a risk if it tries to
govern without Communist help.
   ``Neither of the country's main political forces, the PUWP
(Communists) or Solidarity, can independently _ or even more,
against one another _ face the dangers and pull the country out of
collapse,'' it said.

   After a 12-year, 4.4 billion-mile space
odyssey, Voyager 2 fired its thrusters today to take final aim
toward Neptune, the most distant and last unexplored planet due for
a visit by a spacecraft from Earth.
   ``This is the final movement in the Voyager symphony of the outer
planets,'' said Voyager project scientist Edward Stone, referring to
Voyager's previous exploration of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus.
   ``We're in for a good ride, and it's great everybody can share in
the discoveries that are going to unfold in the next week,'' Stone
said during a late morning news conference.
   The small adjustment in direction today was the last needed to
target Voyager for Thursday's close encounter with Neptune and
Friday's flight past its largest moon, Triton. The maneuver, meant
to nudge Voyager to the right and increased its speed a tiny 1.1
mph, means Voyager will fly closest to Neptune about 8:55 p.m. PDT
Thursday.
   Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory received a signal
from the spacecraft at 8:15 a.m. PDT today indicating the thrusters
started firing at 4:09 a.m. It takes four hours and six minutes for
the signals to reach Earth, even at the 186,000-mile-per-second
speed of light.
   The approaching encounter with Neptune has drawn scientists here
from all over the world.
   ``It's almost like being on a ship of discovery like Marco Polo,
Magellan and Columbus,'' says Jurrie van der Woude, a laboratory
spokesman.
   ``For most of us, this is the last picture show, the last foreign
shores we visit in the solar system.''
   Today's schedule of activities for Voyager included searching for
northern lights around Neptune's north pole, studying the planet's
turbulent weather and snapping pictures of Triton and another moon,
Nereid. The probe also was programmed to make 39 images of the
region in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   As Voyager gets nearer to Neptune, cable television stations will
carry live NASA broadcasts of photographs from the planet.
   On its approach to the solar system's fourth-largest planet, the
picture-snapping space probe already has discovered four moons in
addition to Triton and Nereid, which had been discovered from Earth,
as well as two partial rings of debris orbiting Neptune.
   Voyager also discovered Neptune has a magnetic field;
hurricane-like storms dubbed ``scooters'' with 400 mph winds;
2,700-mile-wide bands vaguely like Earth's jet streams; and a
8,100-by-4,100-mile Great Dark Spot, probably a huge storm like
Jupiter's Great Red Spot.
   NASA listed Voyager's position as of 9 a.m. today as 2.743
billion miles from Earth and 3.211 million miles from Neptune,
approaching the planet at 42,310 mph. Since it was launched in 1977,
Voyager 2 has traveled a curving path totaling 4.4 billion miles.
   With no one planning a mission to Pluto, Neptune is the last
unexplored planet that will be visited by a spacecraft from Earth in
the foreseeable future.
   Neptune, usually the eighth planet from the sun, currently is the
ninth and most distant. Pluto follows an elongated elliptical orbit
and is closer now.
   Thursday night, Voyager makes its closest approach to Neptune by
skirting 3,000 miles above the planet's cloud tops _ much closer
than its encounters with Jupiter in 1979, Saturn in 1981 and Uranus
in 1986.
   Sunday was the 12th anniversary of the spacecraft's launch from
Florida on Aug. 20, 1977. The Neptune encounter is the climax of the
$865 million, twin-spacecraft Voyager mission, which also saw
Voyager 1 explore Jupiter in 1979 and Saturn in 1980.
   Sending Voyager to Neptune was like ``sinking a 2,260-mile golf
putt, assuming the golfer can make a few illegal fine adjustments
while the ball is rolling across this incredibly long green,''
according to ``The Voyager Neptune Travel Guide,'' written by
mission planning manager Charles Kohlhase and his staff.
   About 170 researchers from around the world are at the laboratory
for the Neptune encounter. They will share ultimate exhilaration as
front-row observers for humanity's first close-up look at the
planet, a blue-green ball nearly four times Earth's diameter.
   But their excitement is tinged with nostalgia because Voyager's
Neptune encounter will be the last planetary flyby for a U.S.
spacecraft. Future probes will orbit their target planets: Magellan
at Venus, Galileo at Jupiter and the Mars Observer.
   Up to 8,000 photographs from Voyager's two television cameras and
discoveries by 10 other science experiments are expected to pour in
so quickly that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
will conduct daily news conferences through Aug. 29.
   Some scientists have said the planet may have 50 or more ring
arcs, different than the complete rings encircling Saturn and Uranus.
   They also say Neptune's magnetic field may create auroras like
Earth's northern lights, and also may trap orbiting radiation belts
similar to Earth's Van Allen belts.
   Today's course correction was designed to assure Voyager can aim
a radio signal at Earth when the probe starts to pass behind Neptune.
   By measuring changes in the signal, scientists hope to determine
Neptune's atmospheric pressures, temperatures and chemical makeup;
whether ring arcs are made of dust, sand, pebbles or boulders; and
how material is distributed inside Neptune.
   After the encounter, Voyager II like its sister craft will
continue on its way out of the solar system. It will continue to
send data back to earth until its fuel runs out in 28 years.

<HEAD>Azerbaijani Workers on Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Workers at 25 businesses in the southern republic
of Azerbaijan went on strike Monday to press for control over the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and other demands, a
journalist said.
   Savinch Najafova, an editor for the official Azerbaijani news
agency Azerinform, said by telephone from Baku, the republic's
capital, that the strike was meant as a warning to Azerbaijani
officials.
   The strikers threatened to continue and expand the walkout, now
planned for just two days, unless authorities meet their demands.
   The walkout is organized by the Azerbaijani People's Front, a
grassroots group fighting for Azerbaijani control over
Nagorno-Karabakh, a mostly Armenian region taken away from
Azerbajain earlier this year. The region was put under the Kremlin's
direct control to settle a dispute over control between Armenia and
Azerbaijan.
   Najafova said a shoe factory and factories making petroleum
equipment and air conditioners were among the 25 businesses closed
because of the strike.
   The People's Front staged a one-day strike Aug. 14, and has been
sponsoring mass rallies in Baku. At a rally Saturday, speakers said
Azerbaijan's Communist Party chief had agreed to just one of their
demands, support for liquidating a special committee administering
Nagorno-Karabakh.
   The strike and demonstrations are also aimed at annulling the
results of this spring's legislative elections and the freeing of
People's Front militants detained during rallies in Baku in November
and December.

<HEAD>$3.4 Billion Needed For Cleanup Of 10 Sites, Report Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As much as $3.4 billion is needed to clean up
10 of the Great Lakes' dirtiest areas, according to a study billed
as a step toward putting a price tag on making the lakes safe for
wildlife and people.
   Because of the high cost, governments should explore creative
means of financing the cleanup such as establishing a trust fund and
suing polluters, said the study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute.
The institute does research for members of Congress from 18
Northeastern and Midwestern states.
   The report is significant because of its emphasis on solving the
problem, whereas earlier studies dealt primarily with what caused
the pollution and which areas were worse off, said Michael J.
Donahue, executive director of the Great Lakes Commission in Ann
Arbor, Mich.
   ``The real challenge right now ... is how to pay for the
cleanup,'' Donahue said. ``Any information that can put a number on
cleanup costs and give some ideas on financing would be very
valuable.''
   The 45-page report says experts have just begun assessing the
costs of cleaning up the lakes, where roughly 300 toxic chemicals
have been discovered in fish and some wildlife species are in
decline.
   A U.S.-Canadian commission has classified 42 separate areas as so
polluted they are unfit for swimming, drinking, fishing and, in some
cases, navigation. Rough estimates of cleanup costs have been made
for 10 of them.
   They include Fox River-Green Bay and Milwaukee Harbor in
Wisconsin; Waukegan Harbor, Ill.; Grand Calumet River-Indiana
Harbor, Ind.; Saginaw River-Saginaw Bay, Clinton River and Rouge
River, Mich.; Black River and Ashtabula River-Harbor, Ohio; and
Rochester Embayment, N.Y.
   The cost of cleaning up all 10 areas is roughly $2.9 billion to
$3.4 billion, the report said, adding that the estimate is probably
too low because cleanup costs have been set for only 19 of the 55
contamination sources identified at the sites.
   Contaminated sediments are the biggest pollution source, the
report said, followed by leaking landfills and hazardous-waste sites.

<HEAD>Some Latvians Want More than Sovereignty: Independence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN IMSE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIGA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The question among many Latvian activists
who gathered here Monday is no longer whether their tiny republic
will declare independence from the Soviet Union, but when.
   Activists at a conference on national self-determination said
sovereignty within the Soviet Union _ a radical goal just nine
months ago _ is no longer enough.
   ``We now have the strong belief that the large majority of the
Latvian nation favors only independence,'' said Ianis Freimanis,
chairman of the pro-democracy Latvian People's Front.
   As a result, Freimanis said in an interview, the 200,000-member
People's Front will vote in October whether to change the
organization's platform from sovereignty to full independence. ``I
believe this will be approved,'' he said.
   The People's Front asked Latvians on May 31 to make their
opinions known. Since then, three volumes of petitions containing
hundreds of thousands of signatures of people favoring independence
have poured into the People's Front office on a cobblestoned street
in the old town of Riga, he said.
   Although Latvia is barely half Latvian, ``Russians see the
catastrophic economic situation, and also don't believe they will be
better off inside the Soviet Union,'' Freimanis said.
   ``Their only question is `Can we be citizens of an independent
Latvia?' We say yes, and their questions are over.''
   The Lithuanian People's Front, called Sajudis, also is
considering a campaign for full independence, and its ruling council
will consider the issue Wednesday, the 50th anniversary of the
Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.
   That agreement, signed on Aug. 23, 1939, by Nazi foreign minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop and his Soviet counterpart, Vyacheslav
Molotov, dealt most of Poland to the Nazis and the then-independent
Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to the Soviet
Union.
   In Latvia, the only reformers still promoting only sovereignty
within the Soviet Union are Communist Party leaders, activists said.
Among non-party activists, disputes are over tactics.
   The People's Front favors winning electoral control of the
Latvian parliament. The first multiple-candidate balloting for the
Latvian Supreme Soviet is scheduled in February.
   The National Independence Movement of Latvia, in contrast, wants
an alternative parliament.
   The group is signing up voters to participate in its own
balloting.
   When half of Latvia's 1.5 million residents are registered, the
Independence Movement plans elections of local councils and then a
parliament, said Alexander Kirsteins, a board member of the group.
   ``They will say they do not want Soviet citizenship,'' he said.
   But Freimanis fears such a strategy could cost activists control
of the existing parliament.
   Baltic activists have used President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
reforms, as well as legal and parliamentary maneuvering to capture
most of the Baltic seats in the new Soviet parliament in Moscow,
giving them a national platform and credibility.
   Next, Latvian activists plan a petition drive to ask that a
parliamentary commission be set up to judge 1940 elections in the
Baltic states illegal, Freimanis said. Those elections, held with
the Soviet army occupying the Baltics, brought to power parliaments
that promptly pleaded for their nations to become absorbed by the
Soviet Union.
   Sen. Bob Kastens, R-Wis., told the activists from around the
Soviet Union and the Soviet bloc that ``Americans of all ethnic
backgrounds support your struggle'' because they defend freedom and
democracy for all.
   The United States has never recognized the Soviet takeover of the
Baltics, and representatives of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia
maintain separate embassies in Washington.

   African leaders declared Monday that
white-run South Africa should end emergency rules and lift bans on
anti-apartheid groups before talks to end racial discrimination.
   The leaders, seeking a new stategy toward South Africa,
conditionally adopted a policy document outlining six preconditions
for talks between the South African government and opposition groups.
   They said the conditions, long demanded by African National
Congress guerrillas, were needed to create a climate necessary for
negotiations. The congress drafted the summit declaration itself.
   The document said talks could ``create the possibility to end
apartheid through negotiations.'' It said the government of South
Africa had the ``urgent responsibility'' to accept such talks.
   The four-day African summit was attended by seven African heads
of state on its opening day Monday.
   Its declaration, adopted by the 16-member Organization of African
Unity ad hoc committee on Southern Africa, will be presented to the
next summit of the 101-member Non-Aligned Movement in Belgrade next
month.
   President Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia is expected to discuss the
prospects for talks in South Africa when he welcomes acting South
African President F.W. de Klerk to Zambia on Monday.
   Besides ending the emergency and lifting bans on anti-apartheid
groups and individual activists, the Harare summit's conditions
included the removal of all troops from South Africa's black
townships, releasing all political prisoners and ending political
trials and executions, and a government commitment to free political
discussion.
   Only then could the government and its opponents discuss a
cease-fire, the formation of an interim government, and a
constitution for a non-racial democratic South Africa based on
one-man, one-vote, the declaration said.
   ``We support the position of the majority of the people of South
Africa that these objectives, and not the amendment or reform of the
apartheid system, should be the aims of negotiation,'' the leaders
said.
   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated
society in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in national
affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain
separate districts, schools and health services.
   African and Western diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said while the declaration was couched in conciliatory
terms, it did not represent a significant new departure by
guerrillas fighting in South Africa or African leaders.
   For its part, South Africa has long insisted the African National
Congress and the smaller, rival Pan Africanist Congress guerrilla
group renounce violence before any talks.
   The Harare declaration said South Africa's black majority
reserved the right to pursue armed struggle and stronger
international economic sanctions against South Africa.
   The 16-member ad hoc committee of the Organization of African
Unity, chaired by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, includes
Algeria, Angola, Botswana, Cape Verde, Congo, Ethiopia, Mali,
Mozambique, Nigeria, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe, the African
National Congress, the Pan Africanist Congress and the South-West
Africa People's Organization.

<HEAD>Darman: Congress Must Wield Sharp Budget Ax To Avoid Larger Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Efforts to cut the federal deficit to the level
set by law are falling short and will require decisive action by
Congress if $16.2 billion in automatic spending reductions are to be
avoided, President Bush's chief budget official said Monday.
   ``It remains my hope, and my cautiously optimistic expectation,
that necessary legislation may be enacted'' to lower the deficit to
the $110 bilion range, Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, said in a letter to the president.
   The automatic cuts can be avoided, Darman wrote, if Congress will
fully implement the budget agreement worked out with the White House
last April. ``Although there has been some progress toward its
implementation, virtually none of the ... (spending cuts and revenue
increases) required to fulfill the terms of the agreement has yet
been enacted,'' Darman said.
   Legislation to carry out the agreement will be the chief business
facing Congress when it returns from a summer recess on Sept. 5.
   Darman's projection of the deficit is based on forecasts about
inflation and economic growth that are more optimistic than those of
the Congressional Budget Office.
   CBO last week issued its own estimate that unless the budget
agreement is implemented, the deficit in budget year 1990, which
begins Oct. 1, would reach $141.5 billion, or $25.5 billion higher
than the OMB prediction.
   Most of that differece is caused by the two agencies' varying
forecasts of how the economy will fare next year and on technical
details of how the recently enacted bailout of the savings and loan
industry will be implemented.
   Under the law, only the OMB figures are used to determine whether
the deficit has been reduced sufficiently and whether most
government spending programs must be slashed across the board to
close the gap.
   The Gramm-Rudman law, which requires a balanced budget by 1993,
limits the 1990 deficit to $100 billion, but includes $10 billion
cushion before across-the-board spending cuts are forced. However,
once the cuts are ordered, they must be sufficient to reduce the
deficit to $100 billion _ not $110 billion.
   Under Darman's forecast, the 1990 deficit will be $116.2 billion
if Congress takes no further action to reduce it. That compares with
just under $170 billion this year.
   Rep. Leon Panetta, D-Calif., chairman of the House Budget
Committee, called the OMB forecast artificially low. ``Even with
these dubious economic and spending assumptions, we face the
possibility of harsh across-the-board spending cuts this fall _ $8.1
billion in domestic programs and $8.1 billion in defense,'' he said
in a statement.
   Even if those automatic reductions are made, Panetta said, ``we
still need $30 billion to $60 billion in additional deficit
reduction for 1991.''
   Social Security and some other ``safety net'' programs are exempt
from automatic cuts. Even so, said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota,
senior Republican on the House Budget Committee, said ``I think
people will notice in a big hurry'' if the mandatory cuts take
effect.
   ``I think we are going to have some big difficulties'' appoving a
package of spending cuts and revenue increases to implement the
April agreement, Frenzel told reporters. ``But my guess is that
Congress is going to lurch across the finish line all right'' and
avoid the automatic reductions, he said.
   Darman's report offers examples of how the ax would fall if the
mandated spending cuts take effect:

<TEXT>
   _The Drug Enforcement Administration would be left with less
money than it has this year, which ``could undermine its ability to
wage an aggresive war on drugs.''
   _The Public Health Service's efforts to prevent the spread of
AIDS would be hampered significantly.
   _All Federal Aviation Administration personnel, including flight
controllers, might be furloughed for three days a month.
   _The Internal Revenue Service might lose 4,700 employees and
reduce taxpayer-assistance phone calls by 10 million.
   _The Defense Department could be forced to slash manpower by
160,000.

<HEAD>The Woman Who Had So Many Renters, She Didn't Know What to Do</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When five couples got together outside a house
they all wanted to rent they found they were getting a runaround
that landed the woman who owned the house in jail on charges of
grand larceny.
   The woman took security deposits from seven potential renters,
then tried to hang on to the money by giving them flimsy excuses,
according to a police report.
   The woman, who allegedly used names including Vickie Newton,
Victoria Alexander and Vickie Simpson, was jailed Monday in lieu of
10 percent of a $10,500 bond. The 35-year-old woman was charged
Sunday with three counts of grand larceny.
   The seven alleged victims, not knowing each other at the time,
put down hundreds of dollars apiece in security deposits to rent the
house on the city's west side. Then, according to the report, a
woman telephoned and gave them various stories including that the
landlord was missing, had died in another state or was traveling.
   ``I started to think all the voices sounded alike,'' said Wanda
Malone, who paid $500.
   Then things began coming together for the hopeful renters and
apart for the woman.
   Johnny Hale called state police in Virginia and West Virginia to
confirm that the owner had died as he was told. Neither agency knew
anything about it.
   Gail Rodgers and her husband said they went to the house and
talked to a baby sitter, who said Victoria Alexander was alive and
out on a date.
   Finally, late Thursday, several of the renters and their families
stopped by the house to find out more about the woman. That's when
the would-be renters got to know each other.
   ``We got there. Another couple said, `You supposed to rent this
place? We are too,''' Dellceia Peterson said. ``All of a sudden
there was five couples there supposed to rent this place.''
   As the renters started to leave, the woman came home.
   ``We all kind of jumped out of the car,'' Malone said. ``She came
in the house. We stood there screaming until the cops came.''

<HEAD>Japan's Socialists Alter Policy Toward Washington, Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID THURBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's Socialist Party on Monday backed away from
its call for dismantling the country's military forces and ending
its security treaty with the United States.
   The major policy shift represented an effort to attract other
opposition parties to a coalition with the Socialists, Japan's
largest opposition party.
   Tsuruo Yamaguchi, secretary general of the Socialists, also said
his party won't seek any drastic changes in the country's capitalist
economic policies.
   He said the Socialists would accept the existence ``for the time
being'' of Japan's Self Defense Forces but would continue to
advocate peace and disarmament.
   He said the party would seek only a gradual reduction of U.S.
bases in Japan, where 64,000 U.S. troops are stationed.
   Yamaguchi told party regional officials the policy changes were
aimed at creating an alliance with other opposition groups, which
have criticized the party's past platform as unrealistic.
   Ms. Doi said she had met with leaders of three other
non-communist opposition parties and they had agreed to work
together while respecting each other's policies.
   The parties _ the Buddhist-affiliated Clean Government Party, the
Democratic Socialist Party and the United Social Democratic Party _
are unified in their opposition to an unpopular new sales tax that
the Liberal Democrats pushed through parliament. However, they
disagree on a range of other issues, including nuclear power and
relations with North Korea and South Korea.
   Until Monday, the Socialists had opposed the mutual security
treaty with the United States and the Self Defense Forces, which
they said violated a constitutional ban on maintenance of land, sea
and air forces. Japanese courts have interpreted the constitution as
allowing defensive military forces.
   Under the moderate leadership of Chairwoman Takako Doi, the
Socialists emerged the biggest winner last month in elections for
parliament's upper house.
   Opposition parties now hold a majority of seats in the upper
chamber and hope to eliminate the governing Liberal Democratic
Party's majority in the lower house in general elections that must
be held by July.
   Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, chairman of the conservative governing party's
Policy Affairs Research Council, said his party would transfer power
to the opposition rather than seek a coalition government if it
loses its majority in the lower chamber.
   The Socialists could lead their own coalition government if a
unified opposition captures a majority of seats in the lower house.
   Yamaguchi called on his party Monday to shift its focus from
criticizing the Liberal Democrats, who have led Japan for 34 years,
to creating positive policy alternatives.
   He said the party's new policies also call for tighter civilian
control of the military and a return to a ceiling on defense outlays
of 1 percent of Japan's gross national product.
   The Japanese government scrapped the self-imposed limit in 1987
following U.S. pressure to spend more on defense.
   Yamaguchi said Japan should maintain its close U.S. relations,
but that the ties should be based on equality and mutual benefit and
be balanced with good relations with other nations.
   Opponents of the U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty have charged
that an alliance with the United States could hurt relations with
other nations and drag Japan into a nuclear war.

<TEXT>
   Newspapers trumpeted the publication of a new
collection of new writings by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who turns
85 on Tuesday, including a speech that says China doesn't need
Western-style democracy.
   Headlines on the front pages of all major newspapers Monday
intensified the spotlight that has been focused on him since he
ordered the June crackdown on dissent, and reinforced the image of
an emerging personality cult.
   The Xinhua News Agency said one speech in the collection,
originally delivered in 1957 and only recently made public, will
appear in full in Tuesday's People's Daily, the Communist Party
newspaper. The speech also was read on the radio Monday evening.
   In it Deng said implementing small democratic measures would make
Western-style ``big democracy'' unecessary.
   ``We do not support the idea of carrying out `big democracy,' in
China,'' he said. ``We can do without such democracy only if we have
`small democracy.'''
   Xinhua said that by ``small democracy,'' Deng meant that the
Communist Party ``should offer channels through which the masses can
make complaints, express their own views and appeal.''
   The democracy speech was published recently in the magazine
``Party Building'' but it has not appeared before in the popular
media.
   The new volume of Deng's writings from 1938-65 has 39 selections,
30 of them previously unpublished. It is one of two new books by or
about Deng since he ordered troops to crack down on student
protestors in Beijing on June 3-4, killing hundreds and perhaps
thousands of people.
   The other book, ``Twenty-Eight Years of Deng Xiaoping,'' details
his life during the same period.
   Xinhua said it is about ``Deng's great courage, foresight, and
sagacity'' and describes ``Deng's brilliant contributions and
exceptional services to the revolution.''
   Such lavish praise was unusual before the recent political
turmoil, but in the past two months, it has become increasingly
common, hinting of an emerging cult of personality that Deng
previously had shunned.
   Major newspapers also praised Deng for his triumphs.
   A photograph of Deng sitting in an armchair and gesturing while
speaking accompanied the article, and was identified as taken on
July 2. Officials at Xinhua's photo department said it was the most
recent available photo of the leader, who is believed to be
seriously ill.
   He was last seen in public on June 9 talking to martial law
troops in Beijing.
   The photo does not show where Deng was or who he was talking with.
   Chinese throughout the country have been ordered to study Deng's
June speech to the martial law troops. The official press has given
prominent play to Deng's writings and speeches, including a
previously unpublished 1956 speech on suiting Marxism and Leninism
to China printed in major papers last week.
   This month, movie theaters across the country began showing a
film on how the 25-year-old Deng led Communist forces in
southeastern China.
   A bronze bust of Deng was unveiled at the China Art Gallery last
month, part of an exhibit on the democracy movement that the
government calls a ``counterrevolutionary rebellion.''

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said Monday
there is a place for the Communist Party in Poland if it embraces
democratic reform, but it cannot try to hang on to power and
privilege by force.
   ``Fish begins to rot from its head. I am beginning from the head.
We need reforms ... If the party doesn't undertand that, and starts
provoking and only provoking _ and they are _ then it will lose
everything,'' he said.
   Walesa advanced his goal to end the Communist Party's 45-year
monopoly on political power when President Wojciech Jaruzelski
nominated Solidarity adviser Tadeusz Mazowiecki as prime minister
Saturday.
   The party Central Committee, after an emergency weekend meeting,
threatened to withhold support from the first East bloc government
without a communist at the helm if it does not receive a significant
enough role.
   In an interview with The Associated Press at Solidarity's
headquarters in Gdansk, Walesa said there is room in the government
for the Communist Party if its members accept democracy and
pluralism.
   ``They (the party) should not fight for keeping their posts
anymore. If they are wise, we ourselves will offer them those posts,
because we need wise poeple, no matter what membership they have,''
he said. ``But if they want to take posts by force, we won't give
them.
   ``We are not against the party, but we are against its monopoly
and stupidity. If this `nomenklatura' understands what the point is,
it will also be needed,'' he said, referring those given control of
key political and economic jobs virtue of their party membership.
   He said the party must ``catch up with the times'' to survive.
   ``If they play the fool they can lose even more,'' he said.
``They will be rejected. And if they understand what these times
mean, the party may rule for a long time because there are many
wonderful people there who are prepared for that. But they have to
change the system, their concept.''
   Asked why, after initial reluctance, Solidarity decided to forge
ahead and try to form a government so quickly, Walesa said the
independent movement's acheivements since April _ negotiation of
political and economic reforms, restoration of its legal status
after a seven-year ban, victories in historically democratic
elections with the promise of fully free voting in four years _ were
insecure as long as the party remained on top.
   ``We had wonderful uprisings in 1956, '68, '70 and '80. It was
beautiful. Society sprung up. Society got some things, sometimes
quite a lot. And then the party always revived itself and took away
whatever society had achieved,'' he said.
   ``The problems was bureaucrats. They were always arranged in such
a way that they could take away whatever society achieved, and it
was the same this time.''
   Despite its stunning election victory in June, Solidarity could
not control the government due to an April accord that guaranteed a
communist-led coalition the majority in parliament.
   When Jaruzelski went from party first secretary to president, the
prime minister became first secretary and the interior minister was
named prime minister, Walesa decided he could not wait.
   ``The worst combination for the rebirth of the monopoly had
emerged,'' he said.
   ``That is why despite that I wanted to do something big only in
four years, I couldn't wait. The monopoly of the party would have
been rebuilt so quickly that there would have been nothing in four
years. That is why we marched in.''
   By creating a coalition with two minor parties long allied with
the communists, Walesa put together a parliament majority and
proposed candidates for prime minister to Jaruzelski.
   Now Mazowiecki must put together a government that will secure
the help poland needs to reverse its economic decline, stop soaring
inflation, reduce a foreign debt of $39 billion, and fill the empty
shelves.
   Walesa said he is concerned by Poles' impatience with the failure
of the economy to improve, but that the political climate ``will be
for changes and reforms.''
   He said there is no rush for the West to come up with an aid
program, but it can expect help because of the tremendous steps
Poland has made toward democracy.
   ``It is not time for the West yet. First comes formation of the
government and its first moves, wise moves. Then it will be time to
really get into it, although even today we need help because without
it there will be no first movements.
   ``We ourselves did so much more than the West expected. If so, we
can expect more from the West, too. That's obvious,'' he said.
   Looking East, Walesa said Poland's Warsaw Pact neighbors need not
be concerned as long as they do not interfer.
   ``We have no aspirations to lead'' reform outside Poland's
borders, he said.
   ``If it (our concept) fits somebody in the bloc, we are not
claiming a monopoly. They can follow us, they can boycott us, as
long nobody disturbs us,'' he said.
   ``So far, nobody is disturbing us and that is very good. And we
hope to keep this status because we need it.''
   When asked if he thought Solidarity will succeed, Walesa smiled
and said: ``Of course. But it will be hard, because it is very
complicated.''

<HEAD>Big-Budget London Musical To Close</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nearly $4 million London musical
``Metropolis,'' the first stage show by American film composer
Joseph Brooks, will close Sept. 2 at a loss, its producers said
Monday.
   Adapted from the 1926 Fritz Lang film, the show opened to poor
reviews March 8 at the Piccadilly Theater, with critics praising
only Ralph Koltai's massive, pipe-filled sets.
   Composer and co-lyricist Brooks is best known for his
Oscar-winning song ``You Light Up My Life.''
   Brian Blessed, the original Old Deuteronomy from ``Cats,'' and
Judy Kuhn, a Broadway veteran of ``Chess'' and ``Les Miserables,''
were the original stars, although Kuhn has since been replaced by
Mary Lincoln.
   Its closing follows a summer that has seen an unusual number of
West End shows struggling to survive amid unusually warm weather
that has kept Londoners and visitors alike out of theaters, many of
which are not air conditioned.
   A series of weekly subway strikes did not help business.
   Only the various Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals, ``Les
Miserables,'' and Dustin Hoffman's London stage debut in ``The
Merchant of Venice'' have done consistently strong business.
   Aside from the works of Lloyd Webber, Trevor Nunn and John Caird,
few London musicals have succeeded in the past few years, and even
the critically acclaimed local staging of Stephen Sondheim's
``Follies'' ended in February in the red after a 19-month run.

<TEXT>
   EL-BIREH, Occupied West Bank (AP) _ At 14, Amjad Jibril Tawil
liked reading mysteries and wanted to be a technician when he grew
up.
   He was born in Denver, but died in this town where his
Palestinian family has its roots.
   Mystery and controversy surrounds his death. Accusations by
Tawil's family that he was tortured and then shot in the chest by
soldiers have involved U.S. consular officials in the case and led
the army to exhume the body and perform an autopsy Sunday.
   The Israeli army said Monday that based on a reconstruction of
events by an army investigator and a government autopsy, ``the
conclusion is that the death of the boy was not caused by the
Israeli security forces.'' The statement did not say who was
suspected of killing Tawil, nor did it give details of the autopsy.
It said police were investigating.
   The tall, thing youth left home Wednesday to go to prayers at the
Al-Ein Mosque. His body was found Friday by a shepherd in the
mountains outside this town nine miles north of Jerusalem.
   What happened in between is uncertain.
   Ayman Tawil said his cousin got caught up in a protest outside
the mosque in which youths threw stones and the army responded with
gunfire, a frequent occurence after Moslem prayers in West Bank
towns and villages.
   ``Maybe he was participating or he just happened to be in the
area,'' Ayman said.
   Other relatives described Tawil as not interested in politics and
not active in the 20-month-old Palestinian uprising. They said he
spent much of his time reading or raising birds.
   ``We used to talk all the time, but it was only about our pigeons
and our chickens,'' said Nabil Amreh, 14, another cousin.
   Ayman Tawil said his cousin's friends saw him run away from the
protest toward the mountains, where Palestinian youths from El-Bireh
and neighboring Ramallah usually hide when chased by soldiers.
   When Tawil did not return Thursday, the family thought he was
arrested. A woman relative, who would not give here name, said she
shouted to Palestinians jailed at Ramallah military headquarters,
who shouted back that Tawil had been there but was taken away.
   Ayman Tawil told reporters he had seen the body before it was
buried by Palestinian youths. ``There were burns on his body, some
of his teeth were knocked out, and there was a bullet in the
chest,'' he said.
   The family believe the burns and broken teeth are signs of
torture. They hired an Israeli lawyer, Leah Tzemel, who said Sunday
that authorities violated an agreement to delay an autopsy until an
independent pathologist came from abroad.
   ``They didn't wait for our doctor to arrive although there was a
promise,'' she said. ``There are results, but they refuse to give
them to the family.''
   Ms. Tzemel noted that autopsy results often are kept from
Palestinian families, and said she was trying to get a second burial
delayed until the foreign pathologist arrived.
   Amal Arafat, an English teacher at the Friends School in
Ramallah, said his pupil spent much of his spare time reading
novels, especially ones with plots of intrique or suspense.
   A week before his death, Ms. Arafat said, the boy wrote a paper
about his future hopes.
   ``He want to be a technician,'' she said. ``He had an uncle in
Jordan, a technician, who really liked his job. Amjad thought the
pay would be good too.''
   Tawil recently switched from English to Arabic curriculum. His
family is a large clan with many connections to the United States.
Amjad's father, Wathak, works in Miami and was flying home Sunday.
The boy returned to his mother's hometown in 1983. In the United
States the family was known by the last name Jibreen.
   An uncle, Walid Amreh, works in Minneapolis. His children switch
effortlessly from Arabic to American-accented English.
   Amreh, at home on a visit, was asked Sunday why the children were
brought from the United States back to the occupied West Bank.
   ``Our family is here, all our relatives,'' he replied. ``It is
where our roots are.''

<HEAD>Hirohito Leaves $13 Million in Taxable Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emperor Hirohito left $13.06 million in taxable
property, a tax office near the Imperial Palace announced Monday.
   It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the
amount of an emperor's taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi
Tax Office said. Until the end of World War II, emperors were
regarded as living gods.
   Hirohito died of cancer on Jan. 7 at age 87. He was succeeded by
Akihito, his eldest son. Hirohito's wife, Nagako, became empress
dowager.
   Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half
of his father's estate, which he divided evenly with his mother. The
empress dowager, as Hirohito's spouse, was exempt from paying
inheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.
   The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces
shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the
emperor is the ``symbol of the state and the unity of the people.''
   Hirohito's estate included stocks and other personal belongings.
Three sacred treasures _ a mirror, sword and jewels _ which were
transferred from emperor to emperor, were tax-exempt, as were about
3,180 items of art owned by Hirohito that were donated to the state,
the tax office official said.

   Michael Williams once contributed to Jim
Bakker's PTL ministry, but on Monday he was just trying to make an
honest buck off it.
   The 22-year-old Williams set up his lunch truck, called the
``Tummy Taxi,'' in a parking lot next door to the federal courthouse
where Bakker went on trial on conspiracy and fraud charges. From
that strategic location, he sold coffee and food to journalists and
passers-by.
   ``I thought I would try to get a little bit of my money back,''
Williams said. ``I gave money to him regularly right up until he
resigned _ even a little after he left.''
   Williams said he bought his parents a lifetime partnership, for
$1,000, in the PTL ministry and planned to give it to them for
Christmas in 1987.
   ``But they never got to use it,'' he said. Bakker quit the PTL
ministry in March 1987 in a sex-and-money scandal. Soon after, the
ministry went into bankruptcy and later was sold to a Canadian
developer.
   Williams, who lives in Charlotte, operates the lunch truck and a
copy toner recovery business. He said he comes from a Methodist
background but ``developed the charismatic mindset'' when he went to
Oral Roberts University in Oklahoma.
   He said he knew the Bakkers spent lavishly but wasn't concerned
about it in the years before Bakker resigned.
   ``I knew they had a more luxurious lifestyle than any other
minister I knew,'' he said. ``But that really didn't bother me until
I found out how much better it really was. When you're talking
millions of dollars, that's a different story.''

<HEAD>Police Consider Criminal Charges in Pleasure-Boat Tragedy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAGGIE JACKSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police said Monday they are considering filing
criminal charges over the late-night sinking of a pleasure boat by a
dredger on the River Thames in which 25 people perished and 38 are
still unaccounted for.
   Divers, aided by more than two dozen police launches, continued
to search the tidal river and salvaged hull of the Marchioness for
more bodies from the accident early Sunday _ the worst on the Thames
this century.
   Police reported 87 people survived.
   Investigators said they have a list of 38 names ``who we have
strong reason to believe were on board but are as yet unaccounted
for.''
   The 90-ton Marchioness had been chartered for a birthday party
with guests from the modeling, photography and banking worlds. It
collided with the Bowbelle, a 1,475-ton sand-and-gravel dredger, and
sank in minutes.
   Police said they have released the dredger's captain and second
mate, who were detained after the accident, but expected to question
them again. They said they also questioned the five other members of
the dredger's crew.
   A police spokeswoman said investigators were considering filing
charges of ``unlawful killing,'' similar to manslaughter, but
refused to say who might be charged.
   Police, the Department of Transport's Marine Accident
Investigation Branch and the Port of London Authority were
investigating the accident.
   The Independent and Evening Standard newspapers reported a
disagreement had developed between the captains of the two vessels
over which craft had the right of way under the central span of
Southwark Bridge, where the collision occurred.
   ``It seems that both captains thought that they were in the
right, but technically the actions of both could be held up to
scrutiny,'' the Evening Standard quoted an unidentified river
authority source as saying.
   Jane Carmichael of Tidal Cruises, the firm that owns the
Marchioness, said that although smaller craft usually stick to the
side arches Marchioness Captain Stephen Faldo was correct to move
through the center early Sunday because of tide conditions.
   ``We do not know what went wrong,'' she said. ``Our captain was
acting totally correctly.'' Faldo is missing.
   Scotland Yard declined to comment on the newspaper reports.
   Police said they listened to tape-recorded radio traffic between
the captains of both vessels and shore control for clues to the
crash.
   After visiting the accident scene, Transport Secretary Cecil
Parkinson announced new safety rules including making charter
vessels record the number of passengers and give them airline-style
safety instructions.
   The new requirements, effective Tuesday, came amid lawmakers'
calls for increased safety on the Thames.
   Parkinson also announced more Port of London Authority river
patrols and random inspections of passenger vessels.
   ``We want to learn from this and make sure it doesn't happen
again,'' said Parkinson, who cut short a vacation abroad after being
informed of the accident.
   Relatives of victims tossed flowers into the water near the site
where the Marchioness sank. The stretch of river reopened for normal
traffic but tour boats did not operate in honor of the dead.
   As the tide dropped, the hull of the Marchioness became fully
visible, resting on its side in a mudbank, the dance floor exposed
to the bright sunshine. Seat covers, menus and bits of debris
floated to the surface of the river.
   The boat went down shortly after leaving for a 1 a.m.-to-dawn
cruise celebrating the 26th birthday of London financier Antonio
Vasconcellos. He is among the missing.
   The double-deck Marchioness was struck from behind and run over
by the dredger, according to investigators. The pleasure boat's top
deck was sheared off.
   Scores of people who had been drinking and dancing below deck
were carried down with the hull as the boat sank quickly.
   The last serious accident on the Thames occurred in 1878, when
the Princess Alice paddle steamer was struck by a coal carrying
ship. About 700 people perished.

<TEXT>
   Thousands of East Germans are escaping
through Hungary in the largest flow to the West since the Berlin
Wall was built in August 1961.
   More than 1,000 East Germans have reached Austria since Saturday,
officials said Monday, and the Red Cross has opened an emergency
facility near the border in anticipation of more.
   The exodus of East Germans began after Hungary, one of the most
liberal Soviet bloc nations, began in May to dismantle barbed wire
and other barriers on the frontier. It said freer Hungarian travel
regulations made a fortified border obsolete.
   East Germans have difficulty getting permission for travel to the
West from their strict communist government but can visit Hungary
with ease. More than 2,000 East Germans are thought to have crossed
illegally into Austria from Hungary since May.
   MTI, the official Hungarian news agency, quoted Capt. Istvan
Szoke of the border guard Monday as saying 15,000 people had been
caught crossing Hungary's borders illegally in 1989 and the number
was expected to reach 20,000 by year's end.
   Another dispatch from the agency said five citizens of Romania,
an East-bloc country that has rejected liberal reforms, made it into
Hungary after one was seriously wounded in a struggle with a
Romanian border guard. It said they crossed the frontier early
Sunday.
   The last time so many East European refugees fled over the
Hungarian border to Austria was in 1956, when Soviet troops and
tanks crushed the anti-Stalinist Hungarian uprising.
   West Germany automatically grants citizenship to East Germans.
The current tide has prompted it to urge the government in East
Berlin to adopt political and economic reform being promoted by the
Soviet Union.
   Many of the East Germans arriving in the West say they left
because of the regime's resistance to change.
   Officials said 350-450 East Germans entered Austria from Hungary
on Monday.
   On Saturday, hundreds pressed through a border gate that normally
is closed but was opened for a Hungarian-Austrian event to promote
European unity.
   Dieter Graf von Bruehl, the West German ambassador, told Austrian
television Sunday his embassy took in 660 East Germans on Saturday
and another 160 on Sunday. He said the average had been 50 to 80 a
day for three weeks.
   Officials say the true numbers are higher because many refugees
travel on with friends or relatives from West Germany without
stopping at the embassy.
   Manfred Kersten, spokesman for the West German resettlement camp
in Giessen, where most refugees go, said 1,400 East Germans arrived
over the weekend.
   More than 65,000 East Germans emigrated or escaped to West
Germany in 1989. Kersten said 10,000 had arrived since the beginning
of August.
   The Red Cross emergency facility is at Moerbisch on Lake Neusiedl
near Austria's border with Hungary. It provides East Germans with
food and medical attention.
   Heinrich Unger, a Red Cross official, appealed on state radio
Monday for contributions of clothing, shoes and towels.
   Witnesses at the border said most Hungarian and Austrian border
officials appeared sympathetic to the refugees. The Hungarian daily
Magyar Hirlap quoted a witness as saying an East German woman
dropped her baby and a Hungarian guard helped her pickup the child,
then waved her across the frontier.

   Poland offers enormous investment opportunities
for U.S. businesses if it can survive its political crisis and
achieve stability, Rep. John Dingell, just returned from a trip to
Eastern Europe, said Monday.
   ``They really want American investment, and they'll take almost
anything that will help them,'' said Dingell, D-Mich. The chairman
of the House Energy and Commerce Committee returned Saturday from a
nearly two-week trip to Eastern Europe with 11 other members of the
panel.
   The congressmen spent four days in Poland and met with leaders of
the Solidarity labor movement, including Lech Walesa.
   The Polish leaders showed more enthusiasm for U.S. investment,
joint ventures, and technical assistance than for loans, Dingell
said. But American businesses are hesitant to join such ventures
while the political situation is unsettled, he said.
   ``American business has to know there is stability,'' he said.
``They've got to know their money will be protected while it's
there, that it won't be ... subject to chaos.''
   Dingell said the banking, food processing and transportation
industries could tap vast markets in Poland. ``There's a crying need
for consumer goods all over the Iron Curtain,'' he said.
   Poles do not trust their country's banking system but would be
eager to invest in U.S. banks, Dingell said. ``Walesa thinks there's
$5 billion stuffed in mattresses and pillows all over Poland that
people would ... put in the banks if they had any confidence in
them,'' he said.
   The U.S. is sending $119 in direct aid to Poland while pushing a
multinational effort to provide Poland with nearly $1 billion in
extra cash this year by pressuring Western banks and governments to
reschedule the $39 billion debt it owes.
   Dingell said that help is fine so far, but should be expanded as
Poland's new government shows it is ready to implement economic
reforms, he said.
   ``This country has got to recognize that that our economic,
political, diplomatic and military self-interests ride on the
success of the Poles,'' he said. ``If they succeed in what they're
doing, we'll have moved more toward world peace and ... economic
progress than anyone can imagine.''

   Catfish farmers continue to boost production,

Agriculture Department said Monday.
   Production in July totaled 27.8 million pounds of live weight
delivered to processing plants, the department said in its monthly
report. That was up 17 percent from July 1988.
   But prices paid to growers averaged 71 cents per pound, down nine
cents a pound from a year earlier, the report said.

million pounds, up 16 percent from the same period of last year.

   When the anti-AIDS drug AZT was discovered 25

useful.
   ``What we said at the time, which was very prophetic, is that we
have a very interesting class of compounds waiting for a disease to
cure,'' Horwitz, a researcher at the Michigan Cancer Foundation,
said in an interview published Monday.
   On Thursday, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis
Sullivan recommended immediate Food and Drug Administration approval
of AZT for treating people who carried the AIDS antibodies even if
they had no symptoms of the disease.
   A wide-open market for the drug is bittersweet for Horwitz.
   Since he never took out a patent when he developed the compound
in 1964, he stands to gain nothing financially from its success.
Pharmaceutical analysts have predicted $1 billion in AZT sales by
1992, and Horwitz could have received huge profits for the first 17
years had he taken out a patent.
   ``Patents, that's the first question my wife asked me,'' he said.
   AZT was developed as a cancer-fighting drug, but animal studies
showed that it wasn't effective. It was put on the shelf until the
mid-1980s, when Burroughs Wellcome Co. looked into its use as a
treatment for herpes.
   That, too, failed. But in 1985, Burroughs Wellcome sent a batch
of AZT along with some other drugs to the National Institutes of
Health in its search for a drug to fight the human immunodeficiency
virus that causes AIDS.
   Those experiments showed promise and more were ordered, leading
to Sullivan's announcement last week. AZT does not cure AIDS, but it
can dramatically slow down the development of the disease.
   ``Sure, I could be a millionaire,'' Horwitz said. ``But on the
other hand, I always felt that if I could leave some legacy
regarding my work at the cancer foundation, my life would be
meaningful.''
   ``But,'' he added, ``the money would have been nice, don't
underestimate it.''

<HEAD>Pope Ends Visit to Spain With Blessing for a Border-Free Europe</HEAD>

   Pope John Paul II on Monday gave his
blessing to a border-free Europe as he ended a three-day visit to
Spain.
   After a 30-minute meeting with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez at
the Asturias airport the pontiff left for Rome and arrived back in
Italy shortly befsore 9 p.m. (3 p.m. EDT).
   Gonzalez told reporters after the meeting that he had discussed
with John Paul the conflict in Lebanon and the political situation
in Eastern Europe, especially the pope's native Poland.
   The pope on several occasions during his visit appealed for a
cease-fire in Lebanon where more than 775 people have been killed
since fighting broke out in March between Syrian troops and their
allies and Lebanese Christian forces.
   ``I confidently place the project of a Europe without borders at
the feet of the Virgin of Covadonga and pray that such an entity
will not turn its back on its Christian roots,'' John Paul said
during a Mass at the shrine of Covadonga high in the Picos de Europa.
   Covadonga, in the mountains near Spain's northern Atlantic coast,
is the site of a victory in 722 of Christian forces over a Moslem
army. The province of Asturias in which the shrine is located is
considered the birthplace of the Spanish nation and monarchy.
   John Paul spoke of European unity several times after arriving in
the medieval pilgrimage city of Santiago de Compostela Saturday. He
spoke of the role of Christianity in breaking down borders and
bringing together people of different languages and cultures.
   But his principal theme was the need to reject materialism and
return to spiritual values, particularly on the part of young people.
   At an outdoor mass in Oviedo Sunday, the pope said man's
increasing technical domination over the material world has left him
``disoriented by the great technical advances that don't permit the
flowering of the essential principles of dignity and solidarity.''
   Felipe, the 21-year-old heir to the Spanish throne, also known as
the Prince of Asturias, accompanied the 69-year-old pontiff during
his stay in Covadonga. It was the pope's third visit to Spain in
seven years.
   King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia greeted the pope on his arrival
in Santiago de Compostela.

<HEAD>Bush Aide Defends Seabrook Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House chief of staff John
Sununu on Monday defended payments made to New Hampshire officials
by the owners of the Seabrook nuclear plant while he was governor,
calling it a ``Catch-22'' situation.
   Sununu said the payments were made under a 1981 law that ``was
not the best-crafted piece of legislation.'' Under it, Seabrook's
owner, Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, was charged by the state
for work done on emergency evacuation plans for the area around the
reactor.
   The presidential aide, briefing reporters covering vacationing
President Bush, was asked about news stories that several prominent
Republicans, including his former deputy chief of staff, David
Carney, had been paid by Seabrook's owner.
   ``The fund was created under a law passed in 1981, two years
before I became governor,'' Sununu said. ``The law was a law that
carried a Catch-22 in it.''
   It was a reference to the title of Joseph Heller's 1961 book
about World War II. The phrase the book popularized refers to a
regulation or law containing a contradictory or nonsensical
``catch.''
   ``The Catch-22 is, if the state did work (on) reviewing the plan,
without those funds being charged, the state would be accused of
supporting financially activities that were to the benefit of the
company,'' Sununu said.
   Sununu, who became Bush's chief of staff in January after three
terms as governor, said he and Carney ``worked very hard to make
sure that we met both the letter and spirit of that law.''

<HEAD>Four Charged in Nebraska Shootout That Ended Prison Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLDREGE, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two couples were charged Monday with
attempted murder in a shootout that one suspect said ended only when
they ``ran out of bullets'' following a helicopter escape from a
Colorado prison.
   Bond was set was $1 million each for Patricia and Fredrico
Gonzales in Phelps County Court. The judge scheduled a preliminary
hearing for them for Thursday.
   Rebecca and Ralph P. Brown also were charged. The same bond and
preliminary date were set for Mrs. Brown, who appeared in court.
Brown, who was shot in the hand during the chase and 9-minute
shootout Friday, was scheduled to undergo further surgery and appear
in court Tuesday, authorities said.
   All four were charged with using a firearm to commit a felony and
with criminal attempt, which county Deputy Attorney Rebecca Miller
described as an attempted murder charge. It carries a maximum
penalty of 50 years in prison.
   Brown and Gonzales also were each charged with being felons in
possession of a firearm, said Dee Berry, deputy county court clerk.
   U.S. Attorney Mike Norton in Denver said he planned to file
federal charges, probably including air piracy. Colorado officials
said they have plans for escape charges.
   But Phelps County Attorney Glenn Clark said he has the first
right to prosecute.
   ``We have them,'' he said. ``I don't know what they're (Colorado
and federal authorities) going to charge. As long as we have them,
they can't get them unless we let them go.''
   Brown and Gonzales escaped Friday from the the medium-security
Arkansas Valley Correctional Facility in Ordway, Colo.
   Prison Superintendent Jim Brittain has launched an investigation
into the escape and actions by two prison tower guards who
reportedly failed to fire at the helicopter despite radioed orders
to do so.
   Authorities said the two wives pirated a rented helicopter at
gunpoint and forced the pilot to land in the prison yard to pick up
their husbands. The women had rented the helicopter on the pretext
of looking at real estate.
   After picking up the men, the helicopter landed a few miles away
and the four transferred to a rental van, leaving the pilot tied up
in a shed. He was unhurt.
   The four were captured eight hours later after exchanging heavy
gunfire with authorities in this south-central Nebraska town of
about 5,600, about 400 miles from the prison.
   ``We ran out of bullets and that's why we finally stopped,'' said
Brown, 30.
   Mrs. Gonzales, 41, used to work with prison inmates as a
volunteer. She met Gonzales, 20 years her junior, at a prison and
married him by proxy earlier this year. She was dismissed from her
volunteer work for misusing her prison clearance.
   Mrs. Brown, 26, interviewed by The Rocky Mountain News in jail
Sunday, said she drove the van during the gunfight in Holdrege.
   ``I don't remember what was going on,'' she said. ``I was just
trying to drive the car while under the dashboard, which was about
three-fourths of the time,'' she said. ``My husband had been dodging
all the buckshots and finally he rolled over to the floor and told
me to stop.''
   Gonzales was serving a four-year sentence for robbery and would
have been eligible for parole in September 1991. Brown was sentenced
for sexual assault, theft and criminal impersonation in a bad check
charge; his parole eligibility date was October 1996.

   Sandy Tribble and Dorothy Brinckerhoff are
students of the force of habit.
   By now, they've seen it often enough. A car pulls onto the dusty
gravel parking strip in front of their country store in Alpine, a
crossroads about 25 miles northwest of Eugene. The driver gets out
and shoves a coin in the lone parking meter out front.
   ``It makes you wonder,'' Brinckerhoff says. ``Some of them never
stop to notice that it's the only meter there. And they never even
ask why there would be a meter in a place like Alpine.''
   OK, why? After all, Alpine is an unincorporated town unsullied by
sidewalks, a City Hall, a police force or parking enforcers.
   The idea surfaced a couple of years ago when Tribble and
Brinckerhoff were at a meeting of the Alpine Community Center, the
name given to a group that raises money to maintain the town's park.
   At the meeting, discussion turned to the recently erected stop
signal at Alpine's downtown intersection. That was progress, it was
agreed, but maybe more was needed. Someone suggested a parking meter.
   ``It started out as a joke, but we kept talking about it,''
Tribble says. ``We said we could take the money from a meter and use
it to maintain the park.''
   Someone called the town of Corvallis, which had a meter to spare.
And so the parking meter came to Alpine, where it sat for a couple
years in a back room of the store. It was erected out front a few
weeks ago.
   ``Most local people think it's a good joke and then they put
money in it anyhow,'' Brinckerhoff said. ``But a few people have
been kind of indignant. `A parking meter in Alpine?' They act like
they moved to Alpine to get away from things like that.''
   Ironically, the owners of the meter have no way to get to the
money. Corvallis officials wouldn't part with the special key that
opens the meter because they still have similar models on the
streets of their city.
   But meter technician Ray Baylor has volunteered to stop by every
couple of months to empty the till.

   Clouds over southern Florida blocked the view of
last week's total lunar eclipse, but maternity wards from Miami to
West Palm Beach reported a dramatic rise in births during and after
the celestial phenomenon.
   At Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital, where an average of 40
births are handled a day, 61 babies were born early Thursday within
hours of the eclipse. And 17 babies _ about twice the daily average
_ were born at Plantation General Hospital during the same period.
   At Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, nine mothers gave
birth shortly after the moon slid through the Earth's shadow. That
was triple the normal daily average.
   Births nearly doubled at South Miami Hospital, and St. Mary's
Hospital in West Palm Beach reported about seven more than usual.
   ``They always say the tide has something to do with births,''
said Pat Jamason, a nursing supervisor at St. Mary's. ``So maybe the
eclipse is responsible.''
   Some doctors were skeptical.
   ``I don't know where these things get started,'' said Dr. Debra
Kenwood, a South Miami gynecologist and obstetrician. ``As far as I
know, there's no scientific proof to support it.''

<HEAD>Former Postmaster General Dies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Postmaster General William F. Bolger
died Monday, the Postal Service announced. He was 66.
   Bolger died at a hospital in suburban Arlington, Va., where he
had been transferred after suffering a heart attack on July 28 in
Omaha, Neb.
   The first career postal employee to lead the service and the 65th
in a line that started with Benjamin Franklin, Bolger served as
postmaster general from 1978 to 1984. The service achieved its first
surplus in 34 years during Bolger's tenure.
   Bolger started as a clerk in the Washington headquarters in 1941
and rose to managerial positions in the New England region before
becoming deputy postmaster general and then postmaster general.
   ``He was a leader of great stature and boundless energy who
brought a spirit of innovation and vision to this organization
during critical times of change and challenge,'' said Postmaster
General Anthony M. Frank.
   Always checking on detail, Bolger was known to pick up a stack of
complaint forms and call Post Office customers himself to straighten
out their problems.
   Bolger struggled with electronic mail, touchy labor-management
relations and a growing volume that led him to push the nine-digit
ZIP code. ``Nobody like numbers,'' he said about the nine digits.
``I don't. But we have a choice. We can do without them and have our
mail service more expensive.''
   And, he admitted, ``We don't handle mail as well as we did 40
years ago.''
   Jim Syers, president of the National Association of Postmasters,
said, ``History may record him as the outstanding postmaster general
of all time.''
   After leaving the service, Bolger founded T-COM Systems Inc., a
business mailing system. Among other directorships and trusteeships,
he served as president of the Air Transport Association of America.
   Bolger is survived by his widow, Marjorie, and two daughters.
Funeral services were not announced.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of riot police used
truncheons to disperse more than 4,000 protesters who defied a ban
on demonstrations Monday marking the 21st anniversary of the
Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.
   Police detained dozens of demonstrators who marched through the
center of old Prague calling for democratic reform and the
withdrawal of Soviet troops.
   The two-hour rally started when a group of Hungarian youths told
a cheering crowd they disagreed with Hungary's participation in the
1968 invasion and then unfurled a banner reading, ``The Bolsheviks
came with tanks, we come with flowers.''
   Many protesters were beaten by police but it was not known
whether any were seriously injured. It could not be determined how
many demonstrators were detained.
   Austrian television said police cut one of its camera cables and
then felled a crew member with what the correspondent described as a
``karate stroke.''
   The rally was smaller than a demonstration by 10,000 people on
Aug. 21 last year, but occurred despite warnings by Czechoslovak
authorities that force would be used to break up any protests.
   Fearing bloodshed, activists had warned against street protests.
   The official CTK news agency said 1,500 people took part in a
``provocation'' organized ``by hostile centers from abroad.'' It
said those detained would be ``punished according to Czechoslovak
law.''
   Police sirens sounded through the area for hours after the
protest began as vanloads of helmeted riot police and regular
uniformed forces moved in to downtown Prague.
   The protest began at about 5 p.m. _ the hour appointed by six
dissident groups for a two-minute silent protest against the
invasion.
   The crowd gathered around the Hungarian activists at the lower
end of Wenceslas Square _ a long boulevard in central Prague _ and
shouted mockingly ``Gorbachev sees this!'' as riot police moved in.
They referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``You must know that Hungarian youth never agreed with the
invasion!'' Hungarian activist Gyorgy Kereniy shouted to applause
and chants of ``Long live Hungary!''
   Plainclothes police barged through the crowd and detained Kereniy.
   As they moved from Wenceslas Square to Old Town Square and the
federal government headquarters, where they were turned back by
police, the demonstrators chanted ``Long live Poland!'' and
``Russians go home!''
   They also shouted support for Alexander Dubcek, the leader of the
``Prague Spring'' reforms crushed by the 1968 invasion.
   Dubcek, who was ousted as party leader in April 1969 and expelled
from communist ranks in 1970, has called for fresh reforms and
rehabilitation of the half a million communists expelled after 1968.
   Prague's Communist leadership has resisted mounting pressure at
home and from East bloc reformers for the political changes under
way in Poland, Hungary and the Soviet Union.
   Authorities had warned against demonstrations this year,
harassing and detaining leading dissidents and mounting a tight
security operation for the past two days in Prague.
   Most well-known dissidents were warned weeks in advance to stay
out of Prague and other big cities for the anniversary. Two who
stayed in the capital, Charter 77 spokeswoman Dana Nemcova and her
son, David, were placed under house arrest on Sunday.
   Activists recommended Czechoslovaks sign a petition for
democratic reforms instead of holding street protests, fearing
police would shoot demonstrators.
   On Monday, the state-run media ran no commentary of their own on
the invasion anniversary, limiting their reporting to comments from
other Warsaw Pact states that participated in the intervention.
   A Polish parliamentary resolution said the invasion was a
violation of international law, and on Monday, lawmakers from
Poland's Solidarity movement led a rally in the border town of
Cieszyn.
   ``Never Again Brotherly Help,'' read a banner carried by
protesters, according to Poland's state PAP news agency.
   Leaders of Hungary's Communist Party said last week they did not
agree with the invasion. On Sunday, Hungarian Premier Miklos Nemeth
said his country has initiated steps within the Warsaw Pact to make
military interference impossible in the future.
   In Washington, the State Department issued a statement saying,
``It is our hope that ... Czechoslovakia will recall the events of
1968 and ... will display a greater tolerance for freedom of
expression and assembly.''

   Voyager 2 fired its thrusters Monday in a
delicate maneuver to bring it closer to Neptune's mysterious moon
Triton. Then it searched for northern lights over Neptune and
snapped pictures of its turbulent storms.
   One of two partial rings _ called ring arcs _ discovered earlier
this month by Voyager has not been seen in subsequent photographs,
leading scientists on a ``search for the lost arc,'' said Bradford
Smith, the head of the Voyager imaging team, which analyzes the
spacecraft's photographs.
   Scientists expect to find many ring arcs as they get closer to
the planet, and to obtain very detailed photographs of them, Smith
said in a press briefing at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Scientists issued their first weather forecast for Neptune,
predicting fairly accurately on Aug. 13 where Neptune's Great Dark
Spot _ an Earth-sized cyclone _ would be found Sunday.
   ``It's not perfect, but weather forecasting isn't a perfect
science,'' Smith said.
   The length of a day on Neptune _ the time the planet takes to
spin on its axis _ was estimated to be 16 hours, based on
observations of intense bursts of radio waves from the planet's
magnetic field, which varies with its rotation. Previous estimates
had put the day length at 17 or 18 hours.
   Voyager has so far discovered four new moons around Neptune,
bringing the total to six.
   The course correction executed Monday didn't use Voyager's main
thrusters, but two tiny thrusters that kept the spacecraft pointed
in the right direction to remain in communication with Earth. The
smaller thrusters also avoided heating that could have disrupted a
radio receiver that partly malfunctioned a year after Voyager was
launched in 1977.
   It was the first time such a maneuver had ever been performed,
the researchers said.
   Use of the main engine could have put mission controllers out of
touch with the spacecraft for up to two days, said Norman Haynes,
Voyager project manager. The controllers couldn't risk that with the
spacecraft's closest encounter with Neptune set for Thursday at 8:55
p.m. PDT.
   The spaceship will pass 3,000 miles from Neptune, and about
24,000 miles from Triton five hours later. The course correction
will bring the spacecraft 439 miles closer to Triton and will allow
better observations of any rings arcs and of the atmospheres of
Neptune and Triton.
   The latest pictures of Triton show the moon is brighter, cooler
and only about half the size scientists previously thought, Smith
said. Its diameter is now estimated at 1,740 miles, about
four-fifths the size of Earth's moon.
   The pictures show dark spots near Triton's equator and a pinkish
cast that may be from discolored frozen natural gas, or methane,
falling to the moon's surface as a sludge, Smith said.
   Triton is a ``most intriguing moon,'' orbiting Neptune in a
backward direction, according to Voyager project scientist Edward
Stone. That suggests it may have been a giant comet that smacked
into some other moon of Neptune, then became trapped into orbit
around the planet.
   At 9 a.m. PDT Tuesday, Voyager will be 2.74 billion miles from
Earth and 2.29 million miles from Neptune, with a speed relative to
Neptune of 37,697 mph.
   Voyager's schedule of activities Monday including searching for
aurora, or northern lights, near Neptune's north pole; making 36
photographs of Neptune to study its weather, 24 pictures of Triton,
29 pictures of the moon Nereid and several photos of the recently
discovered moon designated 1989 N1.
   Last week, Voyager found evidence Neptune has a magnetic field,
suggesting it should also have auroral lights as electrically
charged particles are sucked toward its magnetic poles.
   The probe also was programmed to take 39 pictures of the region
in which partial rings of debris may be orbiting the planet.
   Pictures taken Monday were being recorded on tape aboard Voyager
for transmission back to Earth later in the week.
   Voyager's Monday schedule also included using an infrared sensor
to study composition of Neptune's atmosphere.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Keeps Morgan in Jail</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The full District of Columbia Court of Appeals
on Monday overturned an appeals panel's order to end the nearly
two-year jailing of Elizabeth Morgan for refusing to reveal the
whereabouts of her daughter in a bitter custody dispute.
   The full court, in an order issued shortly after a three-judge
panel ruled 2-1 that Morgan should be released, called for a new
hearing on her appeal of the civil contempt of court citation that
has kept her at the city jail.
   The court did not explain its one-page order.
   The prominent plastic surgeon has been jailed since Aug. 28, 1987
by Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon for failing to produce her
daughter Hilary for visits with Eric Foretich, her former husband
and the girl's father.
   Ms. Morgan said she hid the girl because Foretich had sexually
abused the child. Foretich, who is also a doctor, denies the charges.
   Hilary, whose seventh birthday was Monday, remains hidden.
   In Monday's majority opinion by the three-judge panel, Judge John
M. Ferren said Dixon's attempt to coerce Ms. Morgan into divulging
the girl's whereabouts had failed.
   ``Irrespective of context, once the civil contempt power is shown
to have failed in its intended purpose ... the court must release
the contemnor from jail,'' Ferren wrote.
   Elaine Mittleman, attorney for Foretich, said new arguments have
been scheduled for Sept. 20.
   Earlier Monday, Foretich was joined on the Capitol steps by about
a dozen relatives and supporters to mark his daughter's seventh
birthday.
   Foretich said he decided to hold the ceremony because he is upset
about legislation pending in Congress which would lead to Morgan's
release even if she doesn't bring the child out of hiding.
   Meanwhile, Foretich has filed a $220 million suit against the CBS
television network and six other defendants in connection with the
program ``People Magazine on TV'' broadcast Aug. 16, which carried a
story about the custody dispute.
   The suit filed Friday claims Foretich was defamed, subjected to
emotional distress, suffered an invasion of privacy and was
portrayed in a false light, according to Ms. Mittleman.
   CBS spokeswoman Anne Morforgen said she had not seen the suit and
could not comment.

   Several candidates for the Cabinet of
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani announced new policies Monday
while waiting for Parliament to confirm their appointments.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said Iranian
newspapers had published the programs of 14 of the 22 ministerial
candidates.
   Confirmation debate is to begin Saturday in the 270-member
Majlis, Iran's parliament.
   Rafsanjani appointed a French-trained former justice minister,
Hassan Habibi, on Monday as his first vice president. He chose a
former deputy prime minister, Ataollah Mohajerani, as vice president
for judicial and parliamentary affairs.
   Habibi is among a small group of Western-oriented officials
selected by Rafsanjani to help rebuild the economy and restore ties
with the West.
   The new president is trying to promote moderate, educated
technocrats and remove hard-liners from key positions where they
could block his policies.
   Among the hard-liners are Interior Minister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi,
Prime Minister Hussein Musavi and Intelligence Minister Mohammad
Rey-Shahri, none of whom is included in the Rafsanjani Cabinet. The
job of prime minister was abolished in the new constitution, which
created a strong presidency.
   Rey-Shari, who declined to serve in Rafsanjani's government, was
named prosecutor-general Monday by the head of the judiciary,
Mohammad Ali Yazdi. He selected Morteza Moqtadai as chief justice.
   Mohsen Nourbakhsh, who was educated in the United States and has
been chosen as economy minister, wants a ``complete review'' of
Iran's foreign exchange policies, the official news agency reported.
   It said Nourbakhsh, a former Central Bank governor, would
increase exports other than oil, which now provide only 10 percent
of foreign currency earnings, in order to reduce a chronic trade
deficit.
   Imports have contributed to soaring inflation, which has made
Tehran one of the world's most expensive cities.
   While at the bank, Nourbakhsh held inflation to a 20 percent
annual rate by tight controls on the money supply. He resigned
because of opposition to his plans, however, and inflation quickly
rose to 50 percent.
   Nourbakhsh also called for a stable tax policy that would
encourage medium and long-term investment in industry, IRNA said.
   Abdolhassan Vahaji, Rafsanjani's choice as commerce minister,
hinted at a larger role for the private sector. The agency quoted
him as saying he planned to revive ``traditional'' supply networks
and ``hand over the unnecessary part of the government's
responsibilities in distribution affairs to other sectors.''
   Vahaji also promised to stabilize government-subsidized prices of
basic goods.
   Virtually all trade has been conducted by the government,
creating a bureaucracy with little regard for market factors.
   Another of Rafsanjani's priorities is to convince skilled
Iranians driven abroad by the Islamic revolution's excesses to
return home.
   Mostafa Moin, candidate for higher education minister, said he
would attract ``prominent world scholars'' to Iranian universities
by offering ``material and spiritual'' incentives, IRNA said.
   It quoted Moin as saying he would build more universities and
improve standards.
   Standards at Iranian universities have fallen in the 10 years of
the fundamentalist Islamic regime. Entrance requirements reflect
ideology as much as academic achievement.
   Iraj Fazel, proposed minister of health, wants to improve medical
training by bring top-quality academics back from exile, the agency
said. Fazel also said he would revive the pharmaceutical industry by
rebuilding factories and encouraging private investment in new ones.

   A package holding what appeared to be a tear-gas
bomb was mailed to the Southeastern regional headquarters of the
NAACP and spewed gas throughout an office building when it was
opened Monday, injuring eight people.
   Civil rights leaders denounced the attack as apparently racist.
Federal officials said they will investigate to see if civil rights
violations were involved.
   A caustic gas ``similar to tear gas'' spread from the NAACP
office through air-conditioning ducts into surrounding offices in
the two-story building just southwest of downtown Atlanta, said
Assistant Fire Chief Walter Campbell.
   The eight injured people, taken to two downtown hospitals,
included a 4-month-old infant and a 12-year-old. No one was
seriously hurt, said officials at Grady Memorial Hospital and
Georgia Baptist Medical Center. At least five of the injured were
able to go home within a few hours.
   Two staff members in the National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People office when the bomb went off, Regional Executive
Director Earl T. Shinhoster and secretary Murlene Murray, fled and
were not seriously hurt, apart from burning eyes and throats, Ms.
Murray said.
   ``This is just a terrible experience,'' she added. ``We've never
experienced anything like this before in the 20 years I've worked
here.''
   ``This is a very evil and dastardly act,'' Shinhoster said. ``I
don't know why anyone would want to try to hurt innocent people like
this.''
   The package, ``no bigger than a hat box,'' arrived via Postal
Service ``Priority Mail,'' Shinhoster said. It was addressed to the
NAACP and not to anyone in particular.
   The return address listed a law office and a location, ``but I'm
sure it was fictitious,'' Ms. Murray said. She did not recall a
specific name on the return address.
   Shinhoster said he and Ms. Murray opened the package just after
noon and immediately saw sparks. Two loud pops were then heard and a
cylinder in the package began emitting a white-yellow caustic smoke,
Shinhoster said.
   The package remained largely intact.
   Officers from the Postal Service, the FBI, city police and the
city Fire Bureau arson squad were investigating, Campbell said.
   ``We'll be looking to see what jurisdiction, if any, we've got,''
said FBI agent Diader Rosario. ``Our interest is from the point of
view of civil rights.''
   Mayor Andrew Young urged city employees to be careful when
handling any mail that might look suspicious.
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., was in the neighborhood speaking to
a community group when he heard about the incident and went to the
scene.
   ``Anytime something like this would come to the NAACP office, you
have to believe it's racially motivated,'' said Lewis, a veteran of
the civil rights movement.
   ``I think there's a climate existing in America now,'' he said.
``Twenty-five years later the seeds of racism are raising their ugly
heads again.''

   The Organization of American States on Monday
declared its ``solidarity with Colombia in the face of a criminal
aggression'' by drug lords.
   The OAS Permanent Council acted three days after the
assassination Friday of Luis Carlos Galan, a leading candidate in
next year's presidential election in Colombia.
   Latin American diplomats said they regarded Colombia's request
for a special meeting of the OAS as aimed at pressuring the United
States for more action to crack down on drug use.
   It also was seen as intended to neutralize any potential
criticism for the declared ``state of siege'' under which the
Colombian government has rounded up 10,000 people suspected to have
links with the drug cartels.
   Leopoldo Villar Borda, the Colombian representative to the OAS,
called the situation ``extremely serious,'' but ruled out any
request for U.S. troops to help in countering the drug cartels
accused of engineering Galan's killing.
   The Colombians have long held that if the U.S. market were to dry
up, the cartels' production and influence would decline.
   The resolution appoved by the OAS pointedly reversed the usual
word order and condemned ``the use, traffic and production'' of
drugs, stressing the need for the United States to reduce
consumption.
   Current U.S. estimates indicate Colombia produces some 85 per
cent of the $110 billion in drugs used in the United States a year.
   Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas said in Bogota that
``whoever consumes drugs should remember that he is helping those
who assasinated Galan.''
   In his speech before the OAS, Villar Borda said of Colombia that
``no country has paid so high a price for the traffic created by an
insatiable demand for drugs.''
   Villar Borda reacted with incredulity when asked by reporters if
Colombia was prepared to ask for U.S. troops to crack down the drugs
cartels. He bushed aside the question with a firm no.
   John Sununu, White House chief of staff, said that there has been
no specific request by Colombia for the use of U.S. troops.
   The issue was raised Sunday by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
when he said the United States should consider sending troops, if
requested, to help Colombia, in its fight against the drugs cartels.

   Thunderstorms drenched West Virginia on Monday, generating floods
that washed out a bridge, and storms threatened to cause flooding in
Kansas and Texas. Showers or thunderstorms fell in much of the rest
of the country.
   The overnight storms that brought heavy rain to West Virginia
were part of a system stretching along the Ohio Valley. Three inches
of rain fell in Webster Springs, W.Va., and more than 2 inches fell
in Edray.
   Flood waters washed out a temporary construction bridge near
Bergoo in the eastern section of the state, and roads were flooded
near Persinger, Canvas, Nettie and Mingo.
   A flash flood watch was in effect for most of southern Kansas as
thunderstorms continued developing from southeast Kansas to central
Missouri.
   In central Missouri, overnight storms dropped more than 4 inches
of rain on Gravois Mills and 3} inches on Decaturville. Heavier
rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT included more
than an inch and a half at Cape Girardeau, Mo.
   In western Texas, showers and thunderstorms kept falling after an
early-morning thunderstorm that dumped nearly 2{ inches on Alpine
and nearly an inch at Marfa. A flash flood watch was in effect in
southwest Texas.
   Thunderstorms also struck sections of New England, New York and
Pennsylvania. Scattered showers and thunderstorms spread over the
eastern half of the Gulf Coast to Florida and the southern Atlantic
Coast, and over eastern portions of the Dakotas. Scattered showers
fell in Oregon, western Montana and northern Idaho.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 57
degrees at Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 96 degrees in Cotulla
and Beeville, Texas, Phoenix and Meridian, Miss.
   The low temperature in the lower 48 states Monday morning was 29
degrees in Gunnison, Colo.
   The forecast for Tuesday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the upper Mississippi Valley to the upper Great Lakes region,
the Ohio Valley and the middle Atlantic Coast, with thunderstorms
most likely from Wisconsin to northern Illinois, Indiana, western
Ohio and West Virginia; scattered showers and thunderstorms from the
eastern half of the Gulf Coast to the southern Atlantic Coast and in
west Texas; showers across the Pacific Northwest; and strong, gusty
winds across the northern Rockies.
   High temperatures were expected to be in the 60s and 70s in the
Pacific Northwest and along the California coast; in the 70s from
northeast Minnesota to much of the Great Lakes and northern New
England, as well as in sections of the central Rockies; the 90s from
the southern Atlantic Coast to the Gulf Coast, the Tennessee and
lower Mississippi valleys, the lower Missouri Valley, much of the
Plains and the inland valleys of central and Southern California;
more than 100 degrees across the desert Southwest along the Big Bend
of the Rio Grande in Texas; and in the 80s in much of the rest of
the nation.

<HEAD>Nearly 5 Million Mexicans Believe They Will Emigrate to United States</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost 5 million Mexican citizens believe they
will emigrate to the United States in the next year despite
stringent U.S. immigration laws, a Los Angeles Times Poll found.
   Of those Mexicans who intend to emigrate, 1.3 million said they
would go to California and 800,000 said they would look for work in
Los Angeles.
   ``A lot of those who say they are going may not make it,'' said
Jorge Bustamante, a Mexican immigration expert and president of
Tijuana's Colegio de la Frontera Norte in Baja California.
   The survey, published Monday, was done Aug. 5-13. Face-to-face
interviews were conducted with 1,835 Mexicans 18 years and older in
42 randomly selected cities and towns throughout Mexico.
   Those interviewed were selected through a process called quota
sampling, which ensures the sample conforms to Mexican census
figures according to sex, income, age and locale.
   Economic disparity is still a top reason why most said they would
choose the United States. A majority of the poor surveyed, 69
percent, said Mexican children sometimes go hungry. Almost 6 percent
said they were very likely to live in the United States by 1990.
   In a country of about 85 million residents, 6 percent would equal
more than 4.7 million people. And 23 percent of those who indicated
they may move picked California as their destination, with 14
percent specifically choosing Los Angeles.
   The survey showed 41 percent liked the economic opportunity
offered by the United States. Sixteen percent said they liked the
fact that it is a rich country.
   U.S. Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg, a supervisor for the
San Diego area, said stricter regulations are decreasing illegal
border crossings.
   ``It's a beginning,'' he said. ``If only one in five want to
come, that's a good deterrent.''
   The poll also measured what Mexicans disliked about the United
States: 38 percent mentioned ethnic discrimination; 42 percent cited
drug problems; and 24 percent said the country is domineering.
   Bustamante estimates there are 1.75 million Mexicans living
illegally in the United States, a figure U.S. immigration officials
dispute.
   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

   The army said Monday its soldiers were not
involved in the death of a 14-year-old Palestinian-American whose
body was found last week near Ramallah in the occupied West Bank.
   The family of Amjad Jibril Tawil claimed he was in army custody
after a stone-throwing incident Wednesday and that his body was
found Friday with bruises, burn marks and a fatal bullet wound in
the chest.
   Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij said he had filed a complaint with
Israeli authorities about the death of another young Palestinian,
allegedly was shot and killed Saturday in the biblical town by
security forces masquerading as tourists.
   The army declined comment on Freij's allegations.
   Arab reports said three Palestinians were killed Monday in
confrontations with soldiers.
   Fourteen Palestinians were shot and wounded in stone-throwing
clashes with Israeli troops during a general strike called by
leaders of the 20-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, hospital officials said.
   The army confirmed two deaths and four wounded.
   The deaths raised to at least 543 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israeli troops and settlers since the uprising against
Israeli rule began in December 1987. Ninety-seven Palestinians have
been killed by fellow Arabs, and 38 Israelis have died.
   Based on a reconstruction of events by an investigator and a
government autopsy of the Tawil case, the army said, ``the
conclusion is that the death of the boy was not caused by the
Israeli security forces.''
   The statement did not say who was suspected of killing Tawil, who
was born in Denver, Colo., nor did it give details of the autopsy.
It said police were investigating.
   The family filed a petition Monday with the Supreme Court
demanding the Tawil's body not be reburied until an independent
autopsy could be performed. The body was exhumed over the weekend
for the Israeli autopsy.
   Lawyer Leah Tsemel, who filed the petition, said the action was
taken after the government reneged on an earlier pledge to allow an
independent pathologist to observe the government's autopsy.
   Ms. Tsemel said she also asked the court to order the army to
lift its blockade of the Tawil home. Only family members and
representatives of the U.S. consulate have been allowed in the
house, she said.
   His family reported the boy missing Thursday. They said he went
to pray at a Ramallah mosque Wednesday and a stone-throwing incident
developed after the prayer service.
   Relatives said they were told by other Palestinians that he was
in army custody, but the army denied he ever was held.
   The human rights group Al-Haq, based in Ramallah, issued a
statement saying there was the ``possibility of official involvement
in the youth's death'' and asked for an independent investigation
into the youth's death.
   A military source, who insisted on anonymity, said the fatal
bullet apparently was from a pistol fired at close range.
   In the West Bank, two Palestinian teen-agers were shot to death
in a stone-throwing clash with Israeli troops in the village of El
Ram near Jerusalem, hospital officials said.
   Doctors at Mukaseed Hospital in Arab East Jerusalem identified
them as Wadia Mahmoud Salah, 15, and Hussein Adnan Herbawi, 14.
   In Tekua, near Bethlehem, an 18-year-old Palestinian was fatally
shot in the chest, Arab reports said. Israel radio said he was fired
on from a passing car, but Arab witnesses later said the youth was
shot after a clash with troops. They identified him as Sani Mahmoud
Atwa Sabbah.
   In Jerusalem, the managing editor of the Arabic-language
newspaper al-Fajr newspaper was arrested and placed under a
six-month administrative detention, said Israel television and
reporters from the newspaper.
   They said it was the third time Hatem Abdel Qader was arrested
and jailed without charges since the uprising began.

   Gen. Michel Aoun proposed peace talks
Monday, but a Syrian-backed Moslem militia rejected the offer to
negotiate an end to the 5-month-old artillery duel with Aoun's
Christian forces that has killed hundreds.
   There was no response to Aoun's proposal from the Syrian forces,
in Lebanon since 1976.
   ``I am ready any time to discuss Lebanon's future at a
round-table with leaders of the other side,'' Aoun said in an
interview published by the Paris-based Arabic magazine Koll el-Arab.
His press office confirmed the quote was accurate.
   Aoun made no mention of his previous condition that
Christian-Moslem negotiations on political reforms could not be held
until Syria pulled its 40,000 troops out of Lebanon.
   Druse leader Walid Jumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party
dismissed the offer as ``a trick to allow Aoun a breathing spell to
rearm and remartial his forces.''
   In a statement, Jumblatt said Aoun would never be accepted as a
negotiator, asserting that a Moslem-Christian dialogue ``can begin
only after the butcher is overthrown and brought to trial for his
crimes.''
   The statement also condemned the arrival of French warships off
Lebanon, and said President Francois Mitterrand's government wants
``to kindle a new Crusaders' war in Lebanon.'' France ruled the
country from the end of World War I till independence in 1943.
   Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam reiterated his
country's determination ``to take all measures to guarantee the
unity'' of Lebanon but made no reference to Aoun's offer.
   Khaddam told a meeting of Syria's ruling Baath Socialist
Party,``National entente is the safe way to end the Lebanese
crisis.... Syria will assist all patriotic Lebanese ... to estabish
a democratic system in which all Lebanese have equal rights and
duties.''
   He did not criticize France by name but spoke of Western
involvement that had ``negative repercussions of further
complicating the Lebanese crisis.''
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd said Monday that Lebanon's Christian and
Moslem leaders must start cooperating if a settlement is to be
reached in Lebanon's civil war that began in 1975. Syria sent its
troops into Lebanon, originally as a peacekeeping force, in 1976.
   Fahd's statement ended speculation that he was about to resume a
mediation bid he undertook along with King Hassan II of Morocco and
President Chadlin Bendjedid of Algeria. The Arab League negotiators
announced on Aug. 1 their efforts were deadlocked over Syria's
refusal to withdraw its troops.
   Aoun calls the Syrians an occupation army and has declared a
``war of liberation'' against them.
   All radio stations broadcast Aoun's offer as his 20,000 soldiers
exchanged sporadic artillery and tank fire with the Syrians across
divided Beirut and in the hills above the capital.
   Police reported one person killed and 14 wounded.
   By police count, 785 people have been killed and 2,140 wounded
since the latest fighting began March 8 between Aoun's soldiers and
an alliance of Syrians and Moslem militias. Most casualties have
been civilians.
   The artillery and rocket fire has abated since the U.N. Security
Council passed a resolution on Aug. 15 calling for a cease-fire.
   Many stores were open Monday and traffic was heavy. The money
market reopened and banks were operating for the first time in 10
days.
   By early afternoon, however, stores closed their shutters and
long convoys of automobiles headed back to south Lebanon.
   Only 150,000-200,000 of Beirut's 1.5 million people are still
living in the city.
   Police said the Syrians hit the Christian-held coast around
Byblos with 100 shells and rockets overnight to turn back three
ships carrying food to the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   Aoun's forces have been receiving weapons from Iraq, Syria's main
Arab foe.
   In Sidon, south Lebanon, a freighter that had smuggled food to
the Christians was blown up by three bombs at dawn Monday, police
said. Three other freighters were wrecked by similar explosions in
June.
   Beirut media said Monday the French warships were intended to
break the Syrian siege of the Christian heartland.
   An-Nahar, an independent newspaper, quoted sources as saying the
flotilla would ensure that arms and fuel supplies reached the
Christians.
   Last week, the French sent an aircraft carrier, a destroyer, a
hospital ship and a fuel tanker, ostensibly to help evacuate French
citizens if necessary. About 7,000 French nationals live in Lebanon.
   The An-Nahar report quoted a ``high-ranking source'' as saying:
``France is just giving a humanitarian excuse for its upcoming
military intervention.''
   Rene Ala, the French ambassador, said Monday he assured acting
Prime Minister Salim Hoss that France is not contemplating
intervention. Hoss heads a Moslem Cabinet that competes with a
Christian government led by Aoun.
   Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian organization believed to sponsor
groups holding Western hostages in Lebanon, threatened anti-French
suicide bombings if France takes military action.
   Sixteen foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including eight
Americans. The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief
Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped
March 16, 1985.

<HEAD>Pacific Telesis Settlement Raises Hope in Other Phone Strikes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The settlement of a telephone strike in California and Nevada
appeared to give new impetus Monday to efforts to resolve similar
strikes elsewhere around the country.
   A Communications Workers of America union leader in Indianapolis
said he was optimistic that the Pacific Telesis agreement would lead
to a settlement at Ameritech, which serves five midwestern states.
   There also were hopeful signs in Philadelphia, where negotiations
continued between workers and management at Bell Atlantic, which
covers the mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C.
   Mary O'Hara, an adminstrative assistant for the CWA, said union
officials ``have still got hope'' of meeting a deadline to resolve
the issues with Bell Atlantic by midnight Tuesday. Both sides agreed
to the deadline.
   More vandalism was reported in the strike against NYNEX, which
serves New York and the Northeast. A judge in Albany, N.Y., issued a
temporary injunction ordering strikers not to engage in mass
striking or interfere with operations at New York Telephone, a NYNEX
subsidiary.
   The three continuing strikes involve more than 150,000 workers.
About 42,000 strikers returned to work Monday at San Francisco-based
Pacific Telesis after negotiators reached agreement over the weekend.
   The Pacific Telesis agreement will raise salaries by 11 percent
over three years, according to Jessie Wilson, president of CWA Local
9415.
   Some tension was reported Monday as strikers returned to work
alongside those who had remained on the job during the two-week
strike.
   ``They're not talking to us,'' one directory assistance operator
said of the returning strikers. ``I'm a very mild-mannered person. I
just ignore them.''
   In Indiana, CWA spokesman L. Keith Dooley said he thought the
Pacific Telesis contract could serve as a guide for negotiations
betwee the union and Ameritech.
   ``I haven't seen their package yet, but I think that could have
some affect on what goes on here,'' Dooley said.
   Both CWA and Ameritech officials said they were willing to go
back to the bargaining table, although neither side expressed a
willingness to pick up the telephone.
   ``If we get a call from the company we're certainly available,''
said Dooley.
   ``We are ready, willing and eager if the call comes,'' said Estel
Gibson, a spokesman for Indiana Bell, one of Ameritech's
subsidiaries.
   In Albany, Judge Lawrence Kahn issued a restraining order that
instructs the CWA to have no more than 10 pickets at an entrance to
a New York Telephone building. In addition, pickets must remain at
least 15 feet away from company vehicles and employees and cannot
vandalize company equipment, he said.
   But striking union members said they had been advised by their
attorneys that Kahn had no jurisdiction over the matter and that
they could carry on with their picketing as usual.
   ``Essentially it means nothing,'' said William Sullivan,
president of Local 1126 in Utica, N.Y.
   There were at least 13 incidents of vandalism to New York
Telephone lines last weekend, causing phone service outages to more
than 4,000 customers, company spokesman Peter Muller said.
   Muller said three severed telephone lines were discovered Monday,
bringing to 125 the number of lines cut around New York state in the
past two weeks.

   The rich and ruthless leaders of the
cocaine underworld often have shown they will go to any lengths to
protect their billion-dollar business.
   Last week's killing of Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the top
presidential candidate and acknowledged leader of a new political
generation, was the latest example.
   The government's reaction was vigorous, but again illustrated its
inability to catch the drug lords. Soldiers and police raided their
estates and arrested thousands of employees and underlings but did
not find the bosses.
   Their names are well known: Pablo Escobar, Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha and the brothers Jorge, Fabio and Juan David Ochoa Vasquez,
said to lead the Medellin cartel based in the northwestern
industrial city.
   Escobar is on Fortune Magazine's list of the world's 20 richest
men, said to have more than $3 billion.
   In Cali, a southwestern city, a rival cartel operates under the
leadership of Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela and Hernan Santacruz
Londono, according to authorities.
   The two groups are reported to be warring over the New York City
drug market. About 200 members of the rival cartels have been
reported killed in 18 months and scores of properties in Medellin
and Cali have been bombed or shot up.
   Profits from New York drug sales are estimated at $35 billion a
year, said Gen. Jaime Ruiz Barrera, who spent two years as the
military commander of Medellin.
   Ruiz Barrera recently was sent to Washington as military attache
in an effort to protect him from killers hired by the cocaine
barons. Assassinations attributed to them have occurred as far away
as Baton Rouge, La., and Hungary.
   Colombian drug cartels are said to have financed the training of
2,000 hired assassins in association with extreme right-wing groups.
The assassins are blamed for the deaths of Galan and many before him.
   Cartel killers have terrorized the courts. They are blamed for
the deaths of a justice minister, an attorney general and 220 judges
and judicial aides since 1981, said Judge Antonio Morales, president
of the national judicial employees' association.
   Such bloody intimidation has kept the cartel bosses out of jail
and shielded them from what they fear most _ extradition to the
United States.
   Only one top dealer, Madellin cartel partner Carlos Lehder, has
been captured and shipped to the United States. Handed over in 1987,
he was convicted by a Florida court last year and sentenced to life
in prison.
   Military and police forces occasionally deliver a painful blow to
the dealers, destroying expensive laboratories and seizing fortunes
in drugs. So far this year, authorities have confiscated 26 tons of
cocaine, but that is considered only a small part of total
production.

<HEAD>Sharks Circled Raft of Americans Adrift 66 Days</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A Florida man said Monday that he and
his wife who survived 66 days adrift on a life raft menaced by
sharks tried to signal more than three dozen passing ships before
one spotted them.
   William Butler, 59, said he and his wife Simone, 56, of Miami,
survived on raw fish and purified water until a Costa Rican coast
guard boat picked them up in the Pacific Ocean, 12 miles off the
coast, on Saturday.
   ``We were surrounded by sharks practically all the time and we
felt a lot of panic but thanks to God they never attacked us,''
Butler, an electrical engineer, said by telephone from a hospital in
the port of Golfito.
   He said he and his wife set sail from Panama on May 24 for Hawaii
in their 40-foot sloop, the Siboney. They had been drifting east in
the life raft since June 15, when whales attacked their boat about
1,200 miles southwest of Costa Rica, he said.
   ``In no more than 15 minutes, our boat was destroyed,'' he said.
``But God, always present in our prayers, helped us because we
carried a life raft and we got in it immediately, taking all the
things we would need.''
   They had eight cans of food, some cookies, a water purifier and a
fishing hook, Butler said.
   ``After 20 days adrift all the food was gone,'' he said. ``Then
we started to fish. Thanks to God we always had food and with the
filter we drank fresh water.''
   Before they got in the raft, he said, he sent three distress
messages over the radio but no one heard them.
   ``At least 40 ships passed and didn't see us and every night we
thought we could die,'' he said. ``But the next day, in the morning,
we prayed again.''
   Egbert Vallecillo, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman, said Butler told
him by telephone that the sharks punctured the raft several times
and the couple sealed the holes with a repair kit.
   Vallecillo said he spoke to Butler from the U.S. Coast Guard's
Pacific Command headquarters in Alameda, 10 miles east of San
Francisco.
   In San Jose, Butler said he and his wife were praying again
Saturday afternoon when they saw the Costa Rican coast guard boat.
   ``But they saw us first,'' he said.
   They were picked up 20 miles off Punta Burica, at the border with
Panama and near Golfito, 200 miles southeast of San Jose.
   Butler lost 49 of his 175 pounds and his wife dropped from 150
pounds to 92, he said.
   ``But we are in pretty good shape because we had food all the
time and the doctor at the hospital in Golfito said we can return to
Miami next Monday,'' he said.
   Butler, a Cuban-American, came to the United States from Cuba in
1960. He has two children who live in Miami.
   ``It was a happy ending,'' he said. ``I'm going home to Miami.
I'll buy another boat and will sail again.''

<HEAD>U.S., Industry Warn Against Dolphin Observer Requirement During Tuna
Fishing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. government and the tuna fishing
industry warned Monday that U.S. trade would be hurt and dolphins
would gain little if observers were required to monitor
dolphin-killing by every foreign tuna boat.
   A lawyer for environmental groups told a federal judge that U.S.
law requires foreign-owned tuna boats selling to the United States
to meet the same standard as domestic boats _ an observer on every
boat to monitor and prevent needless killing of dolphins during tuna
fishing.
   But lawyers for the government and the domestic industry
disagreed.
   ``Congress recognized that immediate compliance for the foreign
fleets would be impossible,'' Justice Department lawyer Charles
Brooks told U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson.
   Brooks contended the law allowed Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher to determine that only one-third of the foreign boats had
to carry observers this year. Federal law forbids the United States
to buy tuna products from any nation that violates the observer
standards.
   If 100 percent coverage were required, foreign fleets would
simply stop selling their tuna to U.S. companies and trade instead
with other nations that do not regulate dolphin-killing, said David
Burney, lawyer for the U.S. Tuna Foundation, an industry group.
   Such a requirement ``would precipitously cause these nations to
abandon their participation in the only program that exists'' to
protect the dolphins, Martin Hochman, lawyer for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, told reporters.
   Henderson said he would rule in several days on whether the law
requires every foreign boat to carry an observer.
   In January, the judge issued an injunction requiring all U.S.
tuna boats to carry observers, rejecting the government's argument
that a budget shortage justified a reduction in observer coverage.
Hochman said Congress later approved the money needed for complete
coverage.
   The dolphins, which swim above yellowfin tuna, are killed when
caught in nets cast to catch tuna below the surface. The observers
are there to see that boats comply with a law requiring use of the
best available technology to avoid needless killings.
   Brooks, the government's lawyer, agreed with environmental groups
that foreign boats kill more dolphins. But he said not enough money
and trained observers are available for 100 percent coverage of the
foreign boats. Brooks argued that one-third of the boats was a large
enough sample to tell whether the fleet was complying with U.S. laws.
   However, Joshua Flom, lawyer for the Earth Island Institute and
the Marine Mammal Fund, said Congress had rejected the same argument
as a justification for less than 100-percent observer coverage of
U.S. tuna boats.
   ``Boats behave very differently if they have an observer on
board,'' Flom said. ``Why would Congress require something more
extensive for the domestic fleet than for the foreign fleet?''

   Two congressmen said Monday they are ``deeply
disturbed'' by Justice Department plans to crack down on leaks by
prosecuting government officials and subpoenaing reporters'
telephone records.
   ``You are invoking the statute on theft of government property
which really has nothing to do with leaks,'' Reps. Don Edwards,
D-Calif., and Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a letter to Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh.
   ``Congress has not adopted a criminal statute for leaks, and
certainly never intended the theft of property law to be used in
this way,'' they wrote.
   Edwards is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on civil
and constitutional rights and Schumer chairs the subcommittee on
criminal justice.
   Thornburgh on Sunday said subpoenaing reporters' telephone
records was constitutional. He had said on Aug. 3 he wouldn't
prosecute reporters who obtain news leaks about criminal
investigations but could charge federal officials who are their
sources with stealing government property.
   ``The statute clearly calls for prosecution of those involved in
misusing sensitive information that comes to them in an official
capacity,'' said Thornburgh.
   The department's reversal of an 11-year-old policy that was
intended to protect whistleblowers and reporters from prosecution
was announced the previous day in testimony submitted to Congress.
   The congressmen said they were ``deeply disturbed by the
department's decision to seek criminal sanctions against government
employees who leak information,'' and were ``opposed to forcing
reporters to disclose their sources, through compulsory process or
subpoenas for reporters' telephone records.''
   A source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Monday that
the department had considered subpoenaing the telephone records of
CBS-TV reporter Rita Braver, who reported earlier this year that an
FBI investigation involved Rep. William Gray, D-Pa.
   Stories about Gray abounded during the House Democratic
leadership election and the Justice Department took the unusual step
of announcing he was not the subject of an investigation. Gray was
elected House Democratic Whip.
   FBI agents interviewed department officials about the leak and at
least one official testified before a grand jury.
   CBS learned several weeks ago about the plan to subpoena Braver's
phone records before it happened, and confronted the department,
said the source.
   Tom Goodman, a spokesman for the network in New York, said the
records had not been subpoenaed.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian declined to comment on
the issue.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is reviewing a list of
up to 100 Colombians to decide which might be targeted for
extradition on drug charges now that Colombian President Virgilio
Barco Vargas has said such extraditions will resume, a U.S. official
said Monday.
   The exact number under review remains unclear, said Drug
Enforcement Administration spokesman Frank Shults, who said only
that there are 50 to 100 names on the list being scrutinized.
   ``There are lists of people for whom indictments have been
processed in the United States, some of them going back a number of
years,'' Shults said. ``We, in conjunction with the Justice
Department, are reviewing those lists and making an assessment about
the currency of the evidence, ... the availability of information.''
   On another front, officials who spoke on condition they not be
identified said the United States was preparing to send a small team
of police experts to Columbia to advise judges, magistrates and
journalists, many of whom have been killed by drug gangs, on how to
improve security.
   The $5 million program was approved by Congress over a year ago,
and ``this is not anything new,'' said one official.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said Sunday that the United
States wants about a dozen Colombian drug kingpins sent to the
United States to face trial.
   ``All the biggies are on the list'' of Colombians the United
States would like to gave extradited, Shults said, including the
leaders of the Medellin Carter: Jose Rodriguez Gacha, 41, Pablo
Escobar, 39, and Jorge Luis Ochoa, 39.
   The Colombian government announced that 10,000 people had been
arrested in major sweeps including raids of properties of suspected
drug traffickers, but there was no report if the leaders of the
Medellin or Cali cocaine cartels had been among them.
   One former cartel leader, Carlos Lehder, was extradited to the
United States in 1987, before the Colombian Supreme Court struck
down the extradition treaty. Lehder is now in federal prison in
Marion, Ill., serving a life sentence without parole plus 135 years.
   The United States had been pressuring Colombia to resume
extraditions, particularly of the cartel leadership, and Barco on
Saturday decreed measures that would allow alleged drug traffickers
to be extradited summarily to the United States for trial.
   Barco's move was triggered by the Friday assassination of leading
Colombian president candidate Luis Carlos Galan, an outspoken foe of
the drug leaders.
   Shults said it was ``premature'' to speculate on whether the DEA
would send more agents to Colombia _ beefing up the force of two
dozen agents there now _ to help locate alleged drug traffickers
wanted on charges in the United States.
   The DEA doesn't know where they all are and isn't sure exactly
how Barco's announced willingness to extradite them to the United
States to stand trial will work out.
   ``A lot remains to be seen,'' Shults said. ``We know, basically,
... that President Barco has made this overture, but the specifics
haven't come forth yet. We stand ready to help however we can.''
   Meanwhile, the DEA is concerned about the safety of its agents in
Colombia but is not planning to pull anyone out, as it has done in
other countries when violence threatens to overwhelm them.

<HEAD>Report Says Iowa Crew Untested Before Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy failed to properly qualify the
sailors who worked in the battleship USS Iowa's No. 2 turret when it
exploded last April, a newspaper reported Monday.
   Navy regulations require that all sailors and civilian Navy
employees who work with explosives must first be certified by a
Qualification Board at their posts. Sailors who lack board
certification are permitted to handle the weapons only in the
presence of a supervisor.
   Michael Drowns, one of 11 sailors who escaped turret No. 2 after
the April 19 explosion, told the Daily Press of Newport News that a
Qualification Board was never convened on the Iowa during his three
years on the ship.
   Drowns left the ship Aug. 1 in preparation for leaving the Navy
with a dishonorable discharge Aug. 11.
   Other Iowa sailors and a Navy officer familiar with the Iowa
investigation confirmed Drowns' statements to the Daily Press, but
they asked that they not be identified for fear of retribution by
the Navy.
   Adm. Richard Milligan, who headed the Navy's probe of the
explosion, said no records of a Qualification Board had been found
on the Iowa, one of the sources told the newspaper. Milligan has
declined to comment publicly on the probe.
   Lt. Kevin Wensing said Monday the report on the explosion is in
the hands of Navy officials, but has not been released to the
public. Wensing said he could not comment further.
   Although many of the sailors who worked in the No. 2 turret had
completed basic technical training in a school, none had been
qualified by a Qualification Board, Drowns and other sources said.
   Drowns and another turret No. 2 survivor, Gunner's Mate 2nd Class
John Mullahy, said that before the explosions the turret's senior
enlisted man, Senior Chief Gunner's Mate Reginald O. Ziegler, was
concerned about the lack of qualification booklets.
   Ziegler, one of the 47 sailors who died in the blast, had given
photocopied pages of the Performance Qualification Standard booklets
to some sailors. Navy regulations require that sailors have the
books.
   Mullahy and a third Iowa survivor, Gunner's Mate 3rd Class
Kendall Truitt, said one of the sailors who lacked a book was
Gunner's Mate 3rd Class Robert W. Backherms, the rammerman of the
center gun where the explosion occurred. Truitt said Backherms
joined the ship shortly after Christmas, was inexperienced and may
have caused the blasts by ramming the bags of explosives into the
gun too fast.
   Last month, NBC News reported that Navy investigators believed
the explosion was the result of suicidal sabotage by Gunner's Mate
Clayton Hartwig. Navy spokesman Lt. Greg Smith said July 19 the
conclusion of suicide was not based on official Navy reports.
   Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll Jr., told the Daily Press he
suspected that a decision on whether to convene a qualification
board depends on the commanding officer.
   Carroll, deputy director of the Center for Defense Information, a
private think tank in Washington, said the regulation probably is
followed as much as a regulation requiring paperwork on preventive
maintenance.
   ``The degree of adherence ranged from very, very low to very,
very strict,'' Carroll said. ``I would almost expect you could say
the same thing about the performance qualification process.''

   Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on Monday
offered to negotiate with 11 governors over state environmental
monitoring of federal nuclear facilities within their borders.
   The states are California, Ohio, Florida, Idaho, Missouri,
Nevada, New Mexico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.
They are hosts to a variety of Energy Department defense nuclear
facilities, including nuclear reactors, processing plants, weapons
assembly facilities, and waste treatment and storage operations.
   The department said it wanted to reach agreements that would
allow the states to independently validate the department's own
environmental monitoring data, and to involve the states in setting
priorities and schedules for nuclear waste cleanup.
   ``This further reiterates the commitment of Admiral Watkins ...
to achieve full accountability in the areas of environment, safety
and health and to restore the public's confidence in DOE's ability
to operate its facilities safely,'' said Henson Moore, the deputy
energy secretary.
   Moore said the proposed agreements would be ``unprecedented in
their scope and in the degree of access to DOE facilities that will
be provided to the states.''
   He said the accords would be similar to a model agreement signed
June 28 by Watkins and Colorado Gov. Roy Romer over state access to
the Rocky Flats nuclear plant near Denver.
   Washington state also has a formal agreement with the Energy
Department on participation on cleanup at the federal Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, near Richland.
   Moore said the proposed new agreements would supplement any
existing accords, ``so that each state is afforded an adequate level
of on-site, hands-on monitoring capability.''
   The Reagan administration had vigorously opposed actions by
states to enforce hazardous waste laws at defense nuclear
facilities, but President Bush has taken a more accomodating
approach in the wake of disclosures about mismanagement and possible
criminal violations of environmental laws at some of the plants.

   Eight invalids who said they
were guerrillas suffering from war wounds have occupied the Roman
Catholic cathedral to press their demand for the evacuation of rebel
casualties.
   A dozen civilian supporters accompanied the invalids who remained
in the cathedral after Sunday's service.
   Carlos Chavez, who said his right leg was amputated after he was
wounded in combat last year, spoke with The Associated Press Monday
on the cathedral steps.
   Draped across the main entrance was a banner reading ``FMLN.''
   Those are the initials of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation
Front, a coalition of leftist guerrillas groups that have battling
the government for nearly 10 years.
   ``We intend to stay here until evacuation is arranged for us and
for all the FMLN war wounded,'' said Chavez.
   President Alfredo Cristiani said Monday the issue of the
evacuation of rebel wounded could not be resolved until peace talks
are held.
   ``Evacuation of wounded is a subject that must be dealt with in
the overall dialogue,'' Cristiani told journalists.
   Both the government and the FMLN have declared in recent weeks a
willingness to join in another round of peace talks but no
arrangements have been made.
   There have been four rounds of negotiations since 1984 but none
produced progress towar ending the war that has taken the lives of
an estimated 70,000 people, with most of the victims civilians.
   Chavez said he did not know how many wounded rebels were awaiting
treatment.
   Last May the previous government of President Jose Napoleon
Duarte authorized the transfer out of El Salvador of 109 wounded
guerrillas.
   But that evacuation was not carried out because of disagreements
between Duarte's centrist Christian Democrats and Cristiani's
right-wing Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.
   Nearly 350 wounded guerrillas have been evacuated since 1984,
with most taken to Cuba via Mexico. The last evacuation occurred in
May 1988.
   Monsignor Arturo Rivera Damas, the archbishop of San Salvador,
told reporters that evacuation of the wounded ``was one of the
elements of humanizing the conflict that should be resumed.'' He
said the church was willing to mediate arrangements to conduct
evacuations.

<HEAD>Citing FBI Agent's Mental Problems, Court Orders New Porn Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ordered a new trial Monday
for a defendant in a 12-year-old pornography case that fell apart
when an FBI agent became mentally unbalanced.
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's
ruling that Theodore Rothstein was entitled to a new trial on
federal pornography and obscenity convictions arising from a 1977
FBI undercover operation in Miami, Fla.
   According to court documents, FBI agents Patrick Livingston and
Bruce Ellavsky posed as pornographers in 1977. Their efforts netted
indictments against 16 people, including Rothstein.
   After Rothstein was convicted in June 1981, Livingston was
arrested on a shoplifting charge and gave Miami police his
undercover name.
   ``The government indicated that Livingston had psychiatric
problems involving an inability to distinguish between his real and
undercover identities,'' the 11th Circuit said in its opinion.
``Upon further investigation, it was revealed that concerns for the
mental health of Livingston had been voiced by his superiors as
early as March 1980.''
   Since Livingston's testimony was a key to the convictions of
Rothstein and his co-defendant, Robert DiBernardo, their guilty
verdicts were vacated and the indictments against them thrown out.
The 11th Circuit, however, ruled in 1985 that the indictment could
stand.
   A federal judge then ordered new trials for both Rothstein and
DiBernardo.
   DiBernardo, whose conviction also had previously been reversed,
has been missing since June 1986 and no longer falls under the 11th
Circuit's jurisdiction. The court said he could deserve a new trial
if he surfaces.

   A twin-engine air ambulance crashed
Monday while trying to land at an airport to pick up a stroke
victim, killing the three people aboard.
   The turboprop Beechcraft King-Air operated by Mercy Flights Inc.
hit a power pole at 12:50 p.m., temporarily cutting off power to
part of this city of 1,585 on the southern Oregon coast, said Curry
County Sheriff Chuck Denney.
   The plane was engulfed in flames as it tumbled into the front
yard of a house next to the end of the runway at Gold Beach airport,
he said.
   Denney said the plane apparently veered off course in fog as it
made its approach to the airport while on an assignment to pick up
an 81-year-old stroke victim. The victim was later transported
   The plane hit a parked truck and flipped over before coming to
rest next to the house. The house and a boat were damaged by the
heat from the flames.
   There were no reports of anyone hurt or killed on the ground,
said sheriff's Deputy Karen Baker.
   Mercy Flights identified the dead as the pilot, Richard Mendolia,
40, of Medford; co-pilot Wally Nitowski, 48, of Eagle Point, and the
flight nurse Diane Lefler, 40, of Jacksonville.
   The stroke victim was later transported to a hospital by car.
   Mercy Flights was founded in 1949 to carry children suffering
from polio from rural areas to hospitals in Portland. The crash was
the second in the company's 40 years of volunteer service, officials
said.
   Mercy Flights founder George E. Milligan and three other people
were killed in 1985 when a Mercy Flights plane carrying a patient
from Gold Beach crashed on approach to Medford-Jackson County
Airport.
   Baker said Federal Aviation Administration officials were on
their way to Gold Beach to investigate the crash.

   ``The attorney general agreed to resign and we agreed not to
continue the investigation,'' Forbes said Monday night. ``It was in
the best interest of the state, the best interest of Mr. Brown, and
the best interest of all concerned.''
   Forbes said his office worked ``very intensely'' on the
investigation for four weeks. He said Brown's attorney called his
office about noon Monday and agreed to the arrangement, which
Forbes' office proposed a week ago.
   The agreement was reached at 4:30 p.m. and Brown, 39, submitted
his resignation to Gov. Gaston Caperton at 5 p.m., effective
immediately.
   Under the agreement, Brown cannot talk to reporters about his
guilt or innocence in the grand jury investigation.
   Telephone calls to Brown's home Monday evening were not answered.
His spokeswoman, Carrie Webster, said he would have no comment until
a news conference Tuesday.
   Brown had testified Thursday, Friday and Monday before a county
grand jury that was investigating both the attorney general's
campaign financial records and an allegation that he had lied under
oath during a child custody hearing.
   ``We were going to ask for a vote on charges sometime this
afternoon or early tomorrow,'' Forbes said.
   Brown's resignation marked the second time this year a major
state official had quit amid allegations of misconduct. Treasurer A.
James Manchin, who was accused of mismanaging a state investment
fund that lost an estimated $279 million and was impeached by the
House, resigned last month just before his Senate trial was to begin.
   Brown, a Democrat, was elected in 1984 and re-elected without
opposition in 1988.
   In 1986, Brown was acquitted on charges that he shook down his
staff for campaign contributions. He contended that because he had
solicited the contributions after the 1984 election to help pay off
his campaign debts, the actions did not fall under a state law
prohibiting state officials from soliciting campaign funds from
their staffs.
   The latest grand jury investigation centered on Brown's testimony
in a child custody hearing involving his ex-wife, Alice Sue
Hypes-Brown, and their 5-year-old girl.
   Forbes confirmed that the grand jury was looking into a report
that Brown had denied writing a note introduced as evidence in the
hearing, then later admitted writing it.
   Brown acknowledged that he denied writing the note but said he
realized his mistake almost immediately. He said he requested a
brief recess, and when the hearing resumed he corrected his
testimony.
   The Charleston Gazette reported two weeks ago that the note
involved a request for $50,000 from Brown's former secretary. The
paper said she had been impregnated by Brown, had had an abortion
and demanded the money to keep quiet. The secretary, Brenda K. Simon
on Columbus, Ohio, has filed a $3 million libel suit against the
paper, denying the allegations.
   A native of Mansfield, Ohio, Brown is a graduate of Denison
University and the Yale Law School. He served as a staff attorney
for the Federal Trade Commission and as a deputy state attorney
general from 1978 to 1982.

   New York Yankees outfielder Luis Polonia pleaded
no contest Monday to having sex with a 15-year-old girl last week,
but the judge postponed sentencing until after the baseball season.
   Polonia, 24, entered his plea to the misdemeanor charge before
Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Thomas Doherty. While not an
admission of guilt, a no-contest plea is treated as a guilty plea
for sentencing purposes.
   Polonia faces up to nine months in jail and a $10,000 fine.
   In an interview after the hearing, Doherty said he delayed
sentencing until Oct. 2 to provide enough time for a presentencing
report to be completed. ``The baseball season was not a factor,'' he
said. The regular season ends Oct. 1.
   Polonia's bail was continued at $5,000, and prosecutors said he
would not have to return to Milwaukee until the next hearing.
   The incident took place at a downtown hotel Wednesday. Under
Wisconsin law, an adult may not have intercourse with a child under
the age of 16 even if the child consents.
   Polonia, who made no comments during the hearing except to answer
the judge's questions, returned to New York later and was in the
lineup against Boston on Monday night.
   ``After the season I'm going to be nervous just like I was
today,'' Polonia said of the pending sentencing. ``But it's
something I'm going to have to deal with.''
   Assistant District Attorney John DiMotto urged Doherty to
sentence Polonia immediately, citing the trauma inflicted on the
girl's family.
   Polonia's attorney, Dennis Coffey, issued a statement Thursday
that the player accepted full responsibility and wanted to apologize
to the girl, his team and professional baseball.

   President Bush will propose that the
United States spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion to fight drugs but is
not prepared to send U.S. troops to aid Colombia's battle against
drug lords, his chief of staff said Monday.
   John Sununu, for the first time putting a price tag on the
president's anti-drug blueprint, said it would include more
financial aid for other nations in the international war on drugs.
   Bush will unveil his proposal in a speech to the nation Sept. 5,
the day after he returns to Washington from a nearly-three week
vacation at the family compound here, then will send implementing
legislation to Congress.
   On another subject, Sununu, taking note of renewed threats
against two American hostages in Lebanon, said he would stick to a
White House stance of not reacting ``to each new threat.''
   He said the administration does not want to ``increase attention
on the hostages.''
   As for the drug-fighting program, Sununu said the primary thrust
of the president's plan will be education. Also included will be
money for law enforcement efforts, interdiction and rehabilitation.
   The chief of staff declined to say which federal programs the
president would cut to help finance his anti-drug effort.
   Sununu said Bush made most of the final decisions on the package
Monday, sending orders back to Budget Director Richard Darman
telling him where to siphon funds to partially pay for the effort.
   Sununu appeared to temper Sunday's remark by Attorney General
Dick Thornburgh that the United States should consider a request, if
one were made, by Colombian President Virgilio Barco Vargas for U.S.
troops to aid in the South American nation's battle against drug
bosses.
   Attention on Colombia heightened after the assassination Friday
of leading presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, allegedly
by drug lords. Virgilio Barco ordered a national sweep to search for
the killers; police rounded up about 10,000 people.
   Bush called Virgilio Barco Monday night to express his
condolences over the assassination of the Galan ``and so many
leaders of Colombia,' according to a statement by the White House.
   ``President Barco indicated he had read press speculation about
the U.S. troops in Colombia. He affirmed to the President that U.S.
troops would not be necessary.''
   Bush assured the Colombian president of U.S. support and
``reiterated the United States' intention to render appropriate
assistance as rapidly as possible.''
   Officials of the Drug Enforcement Administration said Monday they
were scrutinizing a list of 50 to 100 names among those arrested in
Colombia to see who might be extradited to the United States on drug
charges.
   On Sunday, Thornburgh said U.S. officials would ``have to look at
any request that we get for either law enforcement or military
assistance seriously.'' Last week, Bush himself said he would give
serious consideration to any request from drug-fighting South
American nations for U.S. troops.
   But Sununu told reporters Monday:
   ``We have in no way prepared for that kind of a request. We
assume that a request for additional assistance would primarily be
focused on material and resources, assets we could provide to them,
and that all indications to date have been that they have ... great
faith in the capacity of their personnel if they have the
appropriate equipment to be able to deal with the problem.''
   Indeed, the Colombian government appears to have no intention of
asking for U.S. military assistance.
   That nation's envoy to the Organization of American States,
Leopoldo Villar Borda, said ``no'' when asked Monday if his
government were preparing to ask for the dispatch of U.S. troops.
   Bush will detail his anti-drug strategy, developed over several
months by his drug policy coordinator William Bennett, in a
televised address from the Oval Office.
   Sununu, who met with Bush in the morning at the president's
vacation home on Walker's Point, talked to reporters while the
president and two of his sons played a fast 18 holes of golf.
   Bush was asked as he teed off about new reports from Beirut that
pro-Iranian hostage holders have threatened the lives of two
kidnapped Americans, James Cicippio and Edward Austin, if France
intervenes militarily in Lebanon's civil war.
   Bush deferred questions to Sununu, saying his chief of staff
would ``explain our position.''
   But Sununu did not go beyond previous administration statements
on the hostages.
   ``We are not going to react to each new threat,'' he said. ``The
policy remains unchanged. The president underscored that the
hostage-takers are responsible for the safety of all the hostages.''
   He noted that France has said it does not intend to intervene
militarily.

<HEAD>Panama Accuses United States Of Treaty Violation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Panamanian government on Monday
accused the United States of violating the Panama Canal Treaties by
conducting military exercises in Panama.
   Also Monday, talks between the opposition and government broke
off with no agreement on who will run the country after Sept.1. The
opposition wants to take power based on its victory in May 7
elections, which were annulled by the government.
   Spokesmen for both sides said they would wait for Wednesday's
meeting of regional foreign ministers at the Organization of
American States' Washington offices before deciding how to proceed.
   Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Jorge Ritter made the accusation to
diplomats after a presentation of Panamanian government film clips
showing U.S. military exercises.
   ``All these maneuvers have been performed outside of the military
zones, and outside of the areas under joint military control,''
Ritter said.
   Ritter said he wanted the diplomats to be ``absolutely sure''
that the maneuvers violate both the treaties and Panama's
territorial integrity.
   Ritter said that the treaty obligates the U.S. government to
coordinate with Panama its maneuvers, air traffic and convoys. He
said the U.S. has not done this in the military exercises.
   U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian President Omar
Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaties in 1977.
   ``The U.S. government has repeated again and again its arbitrary
interpretation of the treaty, saying that all the maneuvers fall
within the treaty limits,'' Ritter said.
   The presentation included clips from 12 recent U.S. military
exercises.
   Ritter said the ``disproportionate presence'' of U.S. military
equipment in Panama was one of the factors impeding an agreement
between the Panamanian government and the political opposition.
   The United States has stepped up its pressure on military
strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega since the May presidential
elections, which international observers say the opposition won.
   Washington has been pressuring Noriega to step down since
February 1988, when he was indicted on charges of drug trafficking
and money laundering by a Florida grand jury.
   OAS foreign ministers proposed on July 20 that a provisional
government be installed Sept. 1, when the term of acting President
Manuel Solis Palma expires, and that new elections follow.
   The government, military and government political parties agreed,
but the opposition has refused, demanding that Noriega resign as
chief of the Defense Forces. The government says Noriega will not
step down.

<BYLINE>By KATHERINE RIZZO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   America's AIDS education efforts have been
impaired by staff shortages at the Centers for Disease Control, the
General Accounting Office said Monday.
   The arm of CDC that handles education programs, the Center for
Prevention Services, requested additional staff four times in 1988,
said a report from GAO, the congressional investigative body.
   But CDC was unable to provide the additional employees ``because
of agencywide staffing contraints,'' the report said.
   This year, the center sought 65 additional employees but money
was available for only 35. As of May 31, the center had 93 staff
members working on AIDS programs and funds to hire 33 more by the
end of the fiscal year, Sept. 30. The center believes it will need
30 additional employees above that, GAo said.
   The report was requested by Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, chairman of
the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
   ``We must make sure that every dollar spent on (AIDS) prevention
counts, and this report raises serious questions in my mind as to
whether this investment is being managed wisely,'' Glenn said in a
statement.
   Health administrators and Congress have been at odds for some
time, each accusing the other of failing to do enough to control
AIDS.
   Earlier this month Dr. James O. Mason, assistant secretary for
health in the Department of Health and Human Services, complained to
Congress that it too often has authorized programs but failed to
provide money.
   His example was an AIDS treatment program. Congress said the
government could spend $15 million to help pay for treatments with
the drug AZT, but lawmakers didn't come through with a new
appropriation. That meant administrators had to find the $15 million
somewhere else if they wanted to run the program.
   The same situation looms for the next fiscal year, when $30
million is authorized for the AZT program, Mason said.
   ``The only place I can find that is to take it out of prevention
or biomedical research,'' he told a House oversight subcommittee.
``Someone has to make a priority decision.''
   AZT costs are expected to rise sharply, whether through Medicaid
or other programs, because of recent dramatic findings that the drug
can delay the onset of harm to the immune system among people
carrying the AIDS virus.
   A course of AZT treatment costs $8,000 a year, which some experts
have said might be halved.
   Last month the number of Americans diagnosed as having AIDS
surpassed the 100,000 mark. More than 58,000 of them have died.

   British transport chiefs rebuffed a demand Monday
by relatives of victims of the Pan Am Flight 103 crash for a public
inquiry into gaps in airline security that allowed a bomb to be
placed aboard the plane.
   The disagreement came at a meeting between Transport Secretary
Cecil Parkinson and relatives of some of the 259 people aboard the
jetliner that exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, on Dec. 21. All of
the passengers and crew perished.
   Transport Minister Michael Portillo, one of Parkinson's deputies,
said there was ``a really very frank exchange of views.''
   Bert Ammerman, U.S. president of the Victims of Pan Am Flight
103, said he told Portillo that ``we are definitely at odds with
some of the statements and the approach'' of his department.
   ``Mr. Portillo is well aware that we are not pleased with his
statements and we were not reassured,'' Ammerman said. ``We are not
satisfied with the position that the Department of Transport has
taken regarding the inquiry and regarding airport and airline
security.''
   Portillo told reporters that the relatives ``were pushing very
hard for a public inquiry into what happened before Lockerbie.''
   ``I said to them that we didn't rule that out but that our main
concern was the criminal investigation and we didn't want to
prejudice that by having matters delved into in public,'' Portillo
said.
   Investigators have said the main suspect in the bombing is an
Arab terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.

   The head of a leading Hollywood
video entertainment company and his wife were found shot to death in
their $4 million home, police said Monday. The motive was unknown.
   The bodies of Joseph ``Jose'' Enrique Menendez, 45, and his wife,
Maria ``Kitty'' Louise Menendez, 44, were found late Sunday in a
front room by their sons, according to Lt. Bob Curtis.
   Menendez was chief executive officer and chairman of the board of
LIVE Entertainment Inc., an affiliate of Carolco Pictures Inc., a
Carolco statement said. He also was an executive vice president of
Carolco and a member of Carolco's board of directors, said Carolco
spokesman Thomas K. Levine.
   Carolco is best known for producing the ``Rambo'' films starring
Sylvester Stallone, which have been one of its major sources of
income.
   Menendez' sons, Eric, 18, and Lyle, 21, reported the slayings to
authorities in a ``hysterical'' 11:47 p.m. phone call, Curtis said.
Police who arrived less than two minutes later found the victims
dead at the scene. They were in street clothes.
   Detectives were considering a variety of possible motives, Curtis
said. Robbery was considered even though there were no signs the
house had been ransacked.
   Several people were questioned by police, but were released.
Police did not release any information about who was questioned or
the weapon used.
   ``All of us at Carolco are shocked by the apparent murder of Jose
Menendez and his wife,'' Carolco Pictures President and CEO Peter
Hoffman said in a statement.
   The $4 million Mediterranean-style house where the killing
occurred has been leased over the years to a variety of celebrities,
including singers Elton John and Prince, the U-2 rock band and
several Arab sheiks.
   Carolco finances, produces and leases motion pictures for
exhibition in domestic and foreign markets, and for later release in
such media as video and pay and free television. The company has a
48 percent voting interest in LIVE Entertainment.
   LIVE Entertainment's name resulted from the merger of
International Video Entertainment Inc. (IVE), where Menendez worked,
and Lieberman Enterprises of Minneapolis.
   Before joining LIVE Entertainment, Menendez spent 14 years as an
executive for RCA Corp. He was executive vice president of all U.S.
operations for the Hertz Corp., an RCA subsidiary, from 1972-1980,
and worked in various posts for RCA@Ariola from 1980-86.
   Menendez also was a member of the boards of directors of Arista
Records and of both the domestic and international ventures of
RCA@Columbia Home Video.
   General Electric Co. bought RCA in 1986.

   Tropical Storm Erin rolled over the open Atlantic
Monday, holding a course that will keep it far from the United
States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
   ``It looks like it will eventually turn northward and be of
primary interest to marine interests,'' said hurricane specialist
Hal Gerrish. ``The way the environment is shaping up, it would be
extremely unlikely for it to hit the United States.''
   At 10:30 p.m. EDT Monday, Erin's poorly defined center was
located near 25.5 north latitude and 43.2 west longitude, or about
1,200 miles southwest of the Azores island chain, Gerrish said from
the center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The storm packed winds of 45 mph, sometimes gusting higher in
squalls, as it moved northwest at 11 mph. Little change in strength
or motion was expected Monday night, Gerrish said.
   Tropical depressions become named storms if their sustained winds
reach 39 mph. Hurricanes are formed when winds hit 74 mph.
   There have been seven depressions in the present Atlantic
hurricane season, which runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. Two hurricanes
have formed so far this year.

   Soldiers and police raided the estates of
cocaine barons Monday, seizing aircraft, cars and cattle and
bringing the number of people arrested in three days to more than
11,000, authorities said.
   One of those arrested Monday was believed to be a finance chief
of the Medellin drug cartel.
   The cartel bosses have eluded the emergency-rule crackdown, but
new raids were being reported hourly across the country.
   President Virgilio Barco authorized the raids after the killings
Thursday and Friday of a judge, a national police colonel and Sen.
Luis Carlos Galan of the Liberal Party, the leading presidential
candidate and an outspoken opponent of the drug bosses.
   ``We haven't yet been able to capture the drug cartel chiefs, but
we have struck hard against their immense fortunes,'' said army Gen.
Manuel Bonnet Locarno.
   In an interview broadcast by the national radio chain Caracol
from the western city of Cali, a cocaine smuggling center, Bonnet
said the strategy was ``economic war'' on the traffickers.
   Defense Ministry communiques said more than 11,000 people have
been detained in about 350 raids, but Bonnet said most were believed
to be simple employees of the cartel members or low-level underlings.
   However, military authorities in Sincelejo, capital of northern
Sucre state, said they had captured an alleged finance chief of the
drug cartel based in the industrial city of Medellin.
   They identified him as Eduardo Martinez Romero and said he was
captured at a ranch two hours outside Sincelejo, but gave no other
details.
   Statements from the Defense Ministry said 622 weapons, 1,023
vehicles, scores of planes and helicopters and four tons of cocaine
paste were confiscated.
   Early Monday on Bogota's northern fringes soldiers swarmed over
an opulent compound said to be owned by Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, one
of the biggest cocaine dealers.
   The estate included tennis, soccer and basketball courts, a duck
pond with a water wheel, a gymnasium with weight-lifting equipment,
an indoor swimming pool and billard and table tennis tables.
Soldiers guarding it said Rodriguez Gacha owned many other estates.
   Among targets of the raids were scores of properties owned by
Rodriguez Gacha and other drug lords, including Pablo Escobar and
Jorge Ochoa. At one of Escobar's ranches, soldiers confiscated 2,000
head of cattle and 100 pigs, the Defense Ministry said.
   Barco invoked the powers of a state of siege that has been in
effect since 1984. It gives the military and police special powers
to detain suspects, stiffens penalties for those convicted of drug
dealing and allows confiscation of property.
   He also authorized the government to extradite drug suspects
wanted in the United States, which the cartel has opposed with
threats and murder.
   Monday was a national holiday and no officials were available to
comment about U.S. willingness to send troops to help in the drug
war.
   At Galan's funeral Sunday, Barco called for international
cooperation to stop the drug trade. U.S. officials said soldiers
might be sent if Colombia asked for them.
   Colombia has repeatedly stressed its opposition to the presence
of foreign troops on its soil and there was no indication that
position had changed.

<TEXT>
   Kim Dae-jung, the leader of the largest
opposition party, surrendered to prosecutors Tuesday for
interrogation involving a legislator's secret trip to communist
North Korea.
   For the second time in three weeks investigators called Kim, head
of the Party for Peace and Democracy, for questioning about the
illegal trip to North Korea by National Assemblyman Suh Yung-won.
   Kim arrived at the Seoul prosecutor's office by car escorted by
12 national legislators from his party. After a nod to dozens of
photographers he went inside with aides.
   Prosecutors said questioning would center around allegations that
Kim knew of the banned trip to North Korea by Suh well before the
case was made public and that he received $10,000 from Suh who had
received the money from North Korean agents.
   Kim has denied the charges.
   Suh, who was arrested June 28, has been charged with espionage,
violating a ban on travel to North Korea and with receiving $120,000
from communist agents.
   Prosecutors claim Suh has admitted he received $50,000 after
meeting North Korean President Kim Il Sung in Pyongyang in August of
1988 and that he gave $10,000 to Kim Dae-jung after returning to
Seoul.
   Lawyers who also belong to Kim Dae-jung's party visited Suh
Saturday and said he had been forced to make a false confession to
incriminate Kim.
   Kim Dae-jung said recently, ``l've never received a penny of

   Military and police forces raided estates
of top cocaine chieftains and detained 10,000 people nationwide as
they tried to put the squeeze on Colombia's powerful drug
underworld, authorities said.
   There were no reports, however, of any drug cartel bosses
arrested in the emergency crackdown, which follows the
assassinations of a leading presidential candidate, a national
police colonel and a magistrate.
   Sen. Luis Carlos Galan, the 46-year-old Liberal Party candidate,
was buried Sunday after hundreds of thousands of people took to the
streets in a public display of grief.
   Meanwhile, thousands of judges and magistrates who walked off the
job last week to protest inadequate security from hitmen hired by
drug traffickers have called off the strike to join the fight, a
spokesman for the jurists said.

   The United States should stand ready to help
the Colombian government in its fight against drug terrorism even if
it means sending in U.S. troops, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh
says.
   ``I think we have to look at any request that we get for either
law enforcement or military assistance seriously,'' Thornburgh said
Sunday on NBC TV's ``Meet The Press.''
   ``You now see an aura of terrorism rather than simply
narco-trafficking,'' he said. ``The assassination of a presidential
candidate, of the chief of police in Medellin, of other judges and
top officials have really brought that country to its knees as far
as enforcing its own laws'' is concerned.
   ``I don't think we ought to respond, as some suggest, willy-nilly
with a military response,'' Thornburgh said. ``But I do think that's
an option that we have to keep open.''

   Dire forecasts of summer gas lines and higher
prices aren't materializing, and analysts say prices at the pump may
be headed even lower as the vacation season draws to a close.
   Although consumers are paying about 15 cents a gallon more this
summer than last, nearly all the increases came in the two months
following the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March. Since June, retail
prices in most areas have slipped slightly.
   On June 13 the consumer group Buyers Up, a division of the Ralph
Nader-founded Public Citizen organization, issued a report saying
tight supplies and rising demand would lead to higher prices and
possibly 1970s-style gas lines by early August.
   In fact there have been no reported shortages of gasoline, even
in remote areas with heavy tourist traffic, according to Joseph
Koach, executive director of the Service Stations Dealers of
America. He noted that many industry groups, as well as the Bush
administration, had disputed Buyers Up's prediction.

   Five months after he retired from a 16-year
career in Congress, Missouri Republican Gene Taylor reached into his
old campaign fund-raising account and tok home $345,000.
   It was perfectly legal thanks to a decade-old law, but even so,
Taylor's decision highlights a practice that is drawing criticism as
ethics questions simmer in Congress.
   President Bush has proposed outlawing the practice and the Senate
already has voted to ban it. The debate could shift this fall to the
House, which has vigorously resisted such proposals because its
members are the ones that would be affected and they have millions
of dollars at stake.
   ``It amounts to a special interest-financed retirement fund,''
complains Susan Manes of Common Cause, a government watchdog group
that advocates an overhaul of the system for financing congressional
campaigns.

   In Manhattan, where even the air is for sale,
developers are wheeling and dealing to keep building higher and
denser on an island that isn't getting any bigger.
   Donald Trump wants to use the rights he owns to land under the
Hudson River to create the world's tallest building. Across town,
the owner of the air space above Grand Central Terminal has been
battling for more than 11 years to convert it to glass, steel, and
cash on the ground.
   ``It's a logical extension of the cleverness of New York City
developers' lawyers,'' says Steve Robinson, co-chairman of
Westpride, a community organization fighting excessive development.
``They push the limits, they invent new mechanisms, they try
anything that may have a shot at working, because there are so many

   Dozens of office and apartment buildings are going up in New
York's midtown area alone, especially around Times Square.

   Developers offered Hannelore Kraus
$1.6 million to drop her lawsuit blocking the construction of what
would be Europe's tallest skyscraper in her neighborhood in downtown
Frankfurt.
   She refused.
   It would ruin the neighborhood, Mrs. Kraus explained in her home
about 200 feet from the building site overlooking one of Frankfurt's
busiest and noisiest intersections.
   Her one-woman campaign against the Campanile, as the skyscraper
would be called, has made the 49-year-old Mrs. Kraus a local
celebrity _ and the bane of developers planning other skyscrapers in
Frankfurt, a world financial center.
   Mrs. Kraus has the right under Hesse state law to block the
Campanile because it would cut her home off from sunlight, and the
law specifies that every homeowner has a right to sunlight.
   The developers have not said how many stories they plan in the
building, but it will be 265 meters tall _ or 869 feet, which would
make it slightly less than three-quarters the height of the
102-story Empire State Building in New York City.
   ``The Campanile is just too big for this area,'' Mrs. Kraus said.
``Then you have the whole array of problems that crop up, for
example, traffic and burdens on the environment.''
   That, she added, isn't worth becoming an instant millionaire.
   ``I can't approve of this building by somehow personally taking
myself out of controversy or by being paid off,'' she said in an
interview in her apartment in the six-story building she owns near
the main railroad station. Developers originally had hoped to start
construction in March and say she is the sole cause of a costly
delay.
   Mrs. Kraus also runs a small pension nearby in her Gutleutviertel
neighborhood.
   While the ethnically mixed crossroads in the city's center often
puts German speakers in the minority, Mrs. Kraus says the Campanile
would destroy the ``excellent neighborliness'' in the area.
   ``Even my pension guests who are here for a short time notice
that,'' says Mrs. Kraus. ``They go down to the small restaurants
nearby, to the Spaniard, or the Yugoslav or the Greek.''
   She says that during the annual summer street festival everyone
in the area takes part, ``even the Turkish grandmothers who before
just looked out of the upper-story windows and didn't dare to come
down.''
   Mrs. Kraus takes pride in defending the area where she has lived
most of her life, and she chuckles as she recalls how a former city
planner predicted money would persuade her to change her mind. Mrs.
Kraus is unmarried but it is customary in Germany to refer to women
in her age bracket as Frau, or Mrs. She also holds a doctorate in
political science and that requires her foes to address her as
``Frau Doktor Kraus'' when they discuss the issue with her.
   ``These skyscrapers are a thing of the past,'' she said, because
of what she called their excessive energy consumption.
   Various developers are watching the outcome closely, because they
plan to build a half-dozen or so skyscrapers in Frankfurt.
   Critics claim the building boom is excessive in this city of
about 600,000 people.
   Developers say the total price tag for the Campanile project,
including the land, runs to nearly $405 million.
   Mrs. Kraus faced off with Valentin Weber of the Fay Industrie-und
Wohnbau KG, representing the developers, on a recent television
program.
   ``If we were making a movie,'' said host Guenther Jauch, ``then
you two would get married in the end, and everything would be
settled that way.''
   Weber responded that he was already ``happily married'' and Mrs.
Kraus observed that, alas, marriages aren't as simple as they used
to be.

<HEAD>Suriname's Government at Odds with Army over Guerrilla War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANA HAYWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARAMARIBO, Suriname (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fragile accord setting out
conditions for ending Suriname's 3-year-old guerrilla war is testing
the civilian government's authority over the army, which previously
ruled the former Dutch colony.
   The government of President Ramsewak Shankar signed a preliminary
accord with the warring Jungle Commando in July, despite the army's
objections that the agreement failed to disarm the guerrillas and
could place too much power in the hands of rebel leader Ronny
Brunswijk.
   Lt. Col. Desi Bouterse, the armed forces chief who ruled the
Georgia-sized nation on South America's northeast shoulder for seven
years until elections in November, 1987, says that if the government
insists on implementing the agreement, it will do so without the
army's help.
   The outcome of the dispute could help answer a question
Surinamers have long been asking: Who is running the country, the
government or the army?
   ``The agreement is testing the obedience of the military,''
human-rights activist Stanley Rensch said in an interview. ``We are
facing a rather complicated and dangerous situation.''
   Since fighting broke out in July, 1986, at least 300 people have
been killed, dozens of villages destroyed and crucial bauxite and
aluminum mining disrupted. An estimated 7,000 Bush Negroes have fled
to refugee camps in neighboring French Guiana after repeated raids
by soldiers flushing out guerrilla sympathizers.
   The war began as a personal feud between Bouterse, 42, a former
physical education teacher, and Brunswijk, 28, a Cuban-trained
soldier who wears dreadlocks and gold chains and once served as
Bouterse's bodyguard.
   Over the years, however, the insurgency assumed political
dimensions, with Brunswijk, a Bush Negro, demanding democratic
reforms, civil rights and economic development for the country's
50,000 to 60,000 Bush Negroes.
   Bush Negroes, also known as Maroons, the descendants of runaway
African slaves, inhabit the rugged eastern interior, where the
fighting has been concentrated. Suriname, South America's only
Dutch-speaking country, has a total population of 400,000.
   Long-stalled peace talks bore fruit after a period of heightened
tension, culminating in the rebel seizure of Suriname's main
hydroelectric plant June 1. The rebels had threatened to blow up the
power plant and part of Afobaka Dam, flooding the capital of
Paramaribo, unless the government agreed to direct negotiations with
the Jungle Commando. The rebels withdrew, however, after 36 hours,
on Brunswijk's orders.
   After talks June 7-8 on the French Guianese island of Portal, a
delegation from Suriname's National Assembly and Brunswijk's Jungle
Commando reached agreement on a tentative peace proposal. The
government signed the pact July 21 and it was approved by the full
National Assembly on Aug. 7.
   The accord declared the intention of both sides to end
hostilities but stopped short of calling for a cease-fire.
Nevertheless, only minor skirmishes have been reported since it was
signed.
   Among the agreed conditions for a permanent peace are an
emergency aid program to rebuild Bush Negro villages, an end to a
state of emergency in the eastern part of the country and the return
of refugees to Suriname.
   The most contentious issue, however, stipulates that Brunswijk's
200 to 300 guerrillas would not have to give up their weapons and
would be transformed into a special security unit to patrol an
interior region comprising two-thirds of the country.
   Bouterse says such a force would be unconstitutional, split the
nation and make Brunswijk the de facto ruler of the interior.
Moreover, the army demands the Jungle Commando be disbanded and
forced to turn in its weapons.
   ``As long as the Jungle Commando is not brought under the central
authority of the government, no other arrangements are possible,''
Bouterse told reporters recently.
   Although Bouterse insists he is not trying to subvert the
agreement, his opposition puts the army in direct conflict with a
government it has never fully trusted.
   ``We are feeling like the government is the enemy of the National
Army,'' said Maj. Badrissein Sital, commander of the 2,500-man force.
   ``Most of the time there is no trust or understanding. The
government uses the excuse that we are a hindrance, but the truth is
they are incapable of dealing with day-to-day problems.''
   Brunswijk's supporters say making the Jungle Commando a police
unit would give the rebels, the main inhabitants in the interior, a
chance to participate in the development of the region.
   ``Ronny asks only that they be given a job ... the task of
attending to peace and development in the interior,'' said Ojerda
Von Dooren, a Franciscan nun close to Brunswijk.
   But Sital said such a force would mean ``the country will be
practically separated in different sections. We can't deal with
that.''
   ``We can't negotiate with terrorists and we've always referred to
Brunswijk as that,'' the army chief said.

<HEAD>Britain Faces War Crimes Dilemma</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Britain is to decide this autumn whether to allow
its first trials of suspected Nazi war criminals living in this
country.
   If it opts for prosecution, it will mean hauling at least three
aging men from the sheltered respectability of suburbia to answer
charges as mass murderers of Jews.
   A report commissioned by the government and published July 24
says there is enough evidence to prosecute four suspects _ one of
whom has since died _ and urges further investigation of 124 other
cases.
   ``To take no action would taint the United Kingdom with the slur
of being a haven for war criminals,'' the report says.
   But the government has made no immediate decision, preferring to
leave it to a vote in Parliament, where lawmakers are deeply divided.
   The year-long investigation, which amassed testimony from
witnesses in the Soviet Union, was conducted by two eminent lawyers,
one of them Sir Thomas Hetherington, 62, Britain's former director
of public prosecutions.
   With the videotaped accounts the lawyers obtained of death camp
atrocities in Nazi-occupied Soviet territories, a legacy of World
War II has returned to haunt Britain 50 years after it declared war
on Hitler's Germany.
   Immediately after the war in 1945, Britain and its allies
accepted waves of refugees; war criminals slipped through
perfunctory screening procedures.
   There was also a tacit policy of letting bygones be bygones. By
1951, Britain had ceased to take part in war crimes proceedings.
   Then the Cold War set in, and at least five Soviet requests for
the extradition of war crimes suspects were rebuffed on the grounds
that Britain had no extradition treaty with the Soviet Union.
   Latterday concern about war criminals prompted the United States
to set up an Office of Special Investigations, and Canada and
Australia have changed their laws in the past five years to allow
prosecutions.
   Now Britain must decide, through the parliamentary vote set for
October, whether to go ahead with the trials.
   The British inquiry followed the submission of a list of suspects
in October, 1986, by the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center to
Home Secretary Douglas Hurd.
   A Scottish Television documentary produced more names, and in the
end the government inquiry checked allegations against 301 people
living in Britain. Because of lack of time the investigators
examined only seven cases in detail.
   ``I was surprised by the size of the crimes and by the quality of
the evidence,'' Hetherington was quoted as saying in an interview
with The Independent newspaper.
   ``I was initially surprised by the memory of witnesses until, I
think it was Simon Wiesenthal, pointed out that people who have been
through that sort of horror don't forget.''
   The Scottish TV investigation focused on Antanas Gecas, now 73, a
Lithuanian-born mining engineer, the only suspect who has been
identified publicly.
   Gecas, a tall, burly man who came to Britain in 1947, lives in a
middle-class district of Edinburgh with his wife and daughter.
   In the Scottish film he acknowledged witnessing atrocities while
serving in one of the notorious Lithuanian police battalions that
killed an estimated 220,000 Jews.
   But he said he only watched and insisted he was now being
victimized by a Soviet smear campaign.
   He took no action against the Scottish TV program, ``Crimes of
War,'' when it was shown the first time in 1987. But when it was
repeated this past July 24, the hour-long film had to be cut off 15
minutes early because he obtained an injunction against it.
   The government report names the suspects in a separate section
being kept secret, along with the videotaped witness accounts, to
avoid prejudicing a trial.
   The suspects in Britain are almost all former nationals of the
Soviet territories of Lithuania, Ukraine and Latvia, scenes of some
of the worst atrocities.
   Mobile death squads, Einsatzgruppen, set up by the Nazi SS and
often enthusiastically manned by locals, killed tens of thousands of
Jews, rounding them up, shooting men, women and children and
sometimes burying alive bullet-ridden victims who attempted crawl
out from the mass graves.
   Hetherington says the first court case could begin late next year
if the law is changed speedily to allow the trial of naturalized
Britons for crimes committed outside this country.
   Some influential voices say nothing will be served; that elderly
witnesses may make mistakes; that Soviet authorities may pinpoint
men who were not criminals but anti-communists.
   One such is Lord Shawcross, a distinguished lawyer who prosecuted
top Nazis at the postwar Nuremberg trials.
   ``I cannot believe that a revival of all these sad and terrible
matters by sensational trials of a small handful of aged men ...
will help to promote understanding and friendship between the
different peoples of the world, will help to eliminate the evil of
anti-Semitism or _ still less _ enhance the respect for British
justice,'' Shawcross said in a letter to The Times of London.
   Legislator Spencer Batiste, of the governing Conservative Party,
replied: ``The simple fact is that those who have been guilty of
horrendous crimes against humanity must never be able to feel that
they are capable of achieving a safe haven in a civilized world.''

<TEXT>
   The state-run television
network faces charges of biased political coverage as the governing
National Party heads toward what could be its most difficult
election since taking power in 1948.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp.'s telecasts are the main
source of news for more than half of the country's 5 million whites,
according to surveys.
   The SABC insists it provides impartial reporting, but critics
charge that a strong pro-government bias undercuts both white
opposition parties and black anti-apartheid groups.
   The Sept. 6 election, although excluding the black majority, is
viewed as a potentially crucial event. Opinion polls suggest that
the far-right Conservative Party and liberal Democratic Party could
gain enough ground to deprive the National Party of an outright
majority in Parliament's dominant white chamber.
   The SABC has been carrying full-fledged political debates for the
first time, allowing opposition candidates to skirmish with their
Nationalist rivals. The debates have been welcomed, but accusations
persist that SABC's news division promotes National Party interests
despite a clause in the corporation's charter calling for
impartiality.
   ``The SABC goes far beyond simply being a propaganda vehicle,''
said John van Zyl, a professor of film and television at the
University of the Witwatersrand. ``It constructs a political map
which shows the National Party in the middle, where the Conservative
Party and Democratic Party are in disarray and the
extra-parliamentary opposition groups are suppressed completely.''
   Van Zyl and some of his students are conducting a study of the
SABC's political coverage during the election campaign. An interim
report issued Aug. 7 said the SABC had ignored the views of major
anti-apartheid organizations and reported their actions in ways that
were favorable to the government.
   They cited as an example the protest Aug. 2 in which black and
Indian patients sought treatment at white hospitals. SABC news
reports suggested that police vigilance helped avert chaos and made
no mention of organizers' statements that the protest was intended
from the start to be peaceful and non-disruptive.
   A wide range of prominent opposition leaders, including white
human rights activists, black trade union officials and clergymen
such as the Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, are seldom heard on
SABC newscasts, while routine speeches by Cabinet ministers often
are reported at length.
   The director of SABC news, Carel van der Merwe, said the
corporation's policy is to report on actions and statements from
non-parliamentary opposition groups if these are deemed newsworthy.
   He said the SABC did not seek to stereotype any political parties
and pursued coverage that would ``supply knowledge and insight to
the viewer.''
   SABC crews sometimes have exclusive access to police operations.
So negative is the SABC's image among activists that its crews
occasionally are evicted from anti-apartheid gatherings.
   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, a militantly
anti-apartheid labor federation, said it felt flattered by ``the
constant barrage of lies and misinformation being spread on SABC
television, radio and other National Party propaganda organs.''
   Van Zyl said government officials sometimes give explicit
instructions to the SABC regarding the content of news reports. One
such incident in 1987 was widely publicized, when President P.W.
Botha telephoned in the midst of an evening newscast and
successfully demanded a revised report on his ouster of a mixed-race
Cabinet minister.
   Asked about government interference in the news, van der Merwe
said: ``I'm not responding to dead horses.''
   The SABC's television service is relatively new, dating back to
1976. It operates two white-oriented channels and two black-oriented
channels.
   The only independent television service is provided by M-Net, a
pay-TV company established in 1986. It is barred from broadcasting
news programs.
   The SABC also operates more than 20 radio stations. The one
independent station, Radio 702 in Johannesburg, is allowed to
broadcast news and recently expanded its news programming.
   The SABC's directors are presidential appointees, and most of its
top managers are Afrikaners, the mainly Dutch-descended whites who
dominate the National Party. But many of the corporation's 7,000
employees are blacks seeking technical experience in broadcasting
that is not available elsewhere.
   Budget deficits have plagued the SABC in recent years, and
critics say the quality of locally produced programs has dropped.
British entertainment unions won't allow their shows to air in South
Africa, and most current programs are series produced a year or more
ago in the United States.
   Against this background, the political debates have been praised
by local television critics as a small step toward meaningful
programming.
   ``Now that the era of two-man (white) debate has arrived, perhaps
the possibility will one day arise of real debate involving all
South Africans,'' wrote Sheryl Raine of Johannesburg's Sunday Star.
``But don't hold your breath.''

   Today is Sunday, Aug. 27, the 239th day of 1989. There are 126
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   On Aug. 27, 1883, the island volcano Krakatoa blew up. Tidal
waves resulting from the cataclysmic explosions in Indonesia's Sunda
Strait claimed 36,000 lives in Java and Sumatra.
   On this date:
   In 1770, the German philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel was
born in Stuttgart.
   In 1859, Colonel Edwin L. Drake drilled the first successful oil
well in the United States near Titusville, Pa.
   In 1908, Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th president of the United
States, was born near Stonewall, Texas.
   In 1928, the Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed in Paris, outlawing
war and providing for the peaceful settlement of disputes.
   In 1945, American troops began landing in Japan following the
surrender of the Japanese government.
   In 1962, the United States launched the ``Mariner 2'' space
probe, which flew past Venus the following December.
   In 1967, Brian Epstein, manager of the Beatles, was found dead in
his London flat from an apparent accidental overdose of sleeping
pills.
   In 1975, Haile Selassie, the last emperor of Ethiopia's
3,000-year-old monarchy, died in Addis Ababa at the age of 83 almost
a year after he was overthrown in a military coup.
   In 1982, Rickey Henderson of the Oakland A's stole his 119th base
of the season in a game against the Brewers in Milwaukee, eclipsing
Lou Brock's record of 118 steals in one season.
   Ten years ago: British war hero Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed
in a boat explosion off the coast of Ireland. The Irish Republican
Army claimed responsibility. A three-day standoff between the U.S.
and the Soviet Union ended as American officials allowed ballerina
Lyudmila Vlasova to leave New York aboard an Aeroflot jetliner after
the defection of her husband, Alexander Godunov.
   Five years ago: President Ronald Reagan announced that a
schoolteacher would be the first ``citizen astronaut'' to fly aboard
the space shuttle. Christa McAuliffe died in the Challenger disaster
in January 1986.
   One year ago: Tens of thousands of civil rights marchers gathered
in Washington to try to recapture the spirit of the late Rev. Martin
Luther King Jr. on the eve of the 25th anniversary of his ``I Have a
Dream'' speech.

<TEXT>
   The name plate outside the building still
carries the old title: Veterans Administration. Upstairs, the boss
says he's going slowly on the trappings of the Cabinet status the
agency got more than six months ago.
   So they've kept the old signs and they're using up the old
stationery, says Secretary of Veterans Affairs Edward J. Derwinski.
This is, after all, a time of budget travail.
   ``We didn't want people to think the most important things were
the fluffy little percs of the world,'' Derwinski said.
   He figures the ones that count more are intangible _ the network
of contacts, friendships and political ties he has built up in a
Washington career that spans 24 years in Congress and a tour in the
State Department during the Reagan administration.
   So far, he said in an interview, the promotion of the veterans
agency to become the 14th Cabinet agency hasn't had a visible impact
on the people who use its services. But Derwinski thinks it will
make a difference.
   ``The real changes are going to come with time,'' he said. ``Some
are intangible... Just the psychology of being at the Cabinet
meetings... Access to the president....''
   That's the status the veterans lobby sought for years in its
campaign to make the VA part of the Cabinet. They got their way when
President Ronald Reagan, who had come to office saying he was going
to cut the size of the Cabinet, agreed to enlarge it in a political
farewell gift during the 1988 campaign. President Bush welcomed the
move.
   As Derwinski once remarked, no politician in his right mind is
against veterans.
   But the big veterans organizations may not always get what they
thought they were bargaining for when they campaigned to create the
department. Derwinski's clout strengthens his hand outside the
government, too.
   That's his answer to the skeptics who worried that interest
groups like the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars
might gain too much influence with the VA seated at the Cabinet
table.
   Derwinski said he looks to groups like those for constructive
advice, but cedes them no control. ``We're running the shop for the
benefit of the individual veteran,'' he said.
   In doing that, there are tricks of the politician-bureaucrat's
trade, and Derwinski knows them. The budget for veterans is handled
by a House appropriations subcommittee that also deals with spending
for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and for NASA.
Although that is not supposed to foster competition among agencies,
it does. ``We're fighting other entities of the government for a
share of the budget,'' he said. ``... Obviously, we've alerted the
veterans groups to that.''
   He also has a case to make at the Office of Management and
Budget, and some advantages to call in there, too, because of
congressional ties and because of the political muscle of the
veterans' groups.
   ``The Hill will take our side more often than not,'' Derwinski
said. ``They know that at OMB. We know that.''
   His predecessor, the last veterans' administrator, came under
criticism for budget cuts that forced reductions in some phases of
care at VA hospitals. The agency operates 172 of them, along with
226 clinics.
   Derwinski doesn't deny the budget problem. ``It's going to be
hitting all of us,'' he said. But he isn't acquiescing in cuts.
Medical care accounts for the biggest chunk of his budget _ nearly
$11 billion _ and those costs keep increasing.
   So Derwinski struck a deal with the administration's budget
managers; he's seeking a review commission to study all veterans'
health care programs, for the first time in 25 years, with an eye to
efficiency and economy, and with a commitment to invest any savings
in maintaining and improving medical care.
   Of course the review commission carries its own set of problems.
Derwinski has asked Congress to set it up to make binding
recommendations on veterans hospitals. Under the bill, Congress
would have to accept the commission findings or scrap the whole
review.
   Derwinski talks of changing missions and combining functions that
overlap or duplicate others, carefully avoiding any suggestion that
some VA hospitals might be shut down.
   Those would be fighting words in Congress. Derwinski said his
years as a Republican congressman from Illinois taught him that
members of Congress consider the VA hospitals in their districts to
be an inviolable combination of patronage and public works.
   So there'll be no easy route for his review plan. But Derwinski
figures he can negotiate with people among whom he served until he
lost his seat to redistricting in 1982.
   ``We can't have Congress piecemealing our operations,'' he said.
``I don't mind arguing with Congress. As an old congressman I can do
it more gracefully than some others.''

``sure things'' that can't miss, that a person is missing out on a
free ride.
   It's the beginning of a series of mistakes, each one leading
deeper into disaster. It's an old story too, one that everyone has
heard at least once and is bound to hear many times more.
   Bert Dohmen, who runs the Wellington Financial Corp. and
publishes the Wellington Letter, has succinctly described the
psychology of the sure thing that traps and embitters so many
individual investors.
   The process begins with the economy running smoothly. All visible
economic problems seem to have vanished. (They're still there, of
course, as they always are, but not so visible.) The stock market
has been rising.
   Why shouldn't it rise? Corporate earnings have been good for many
months, investors are falling all over each other to buy, your
neighbors are talking about the killing they've made, and the
forecasters say the sky's the limit.
   That's usually a market top, says Dohmen. The wonderful signs of
health that attract the small investor were foreseen months or even
years earlier by smart investors, and now they are preparing to take
their profits.
   After the market falls, the small investor who made mistake
number one is set up to make mistake number two. Having lost so much
money so quickly, the small investor is terrified and vows to get
out. That seals in the loss.
   To sell, however, seems to make sense. The urge is irresistible.
Everything looks bleak, the economy appears to be in shambles, other
investors are gloomy, and even some of the optimists are ready to
sell at the first sign of a rally.
   The sense of gloom is pervasive; it cannot be escaped. Bad news
begets bad news; one sad story at a cocktail party leads to another.
Nobody has a good word to say about stocks. Stock analysts forecast
even more bad news.
   One person's disaster is another one's opportunity. Smart
investors seize the bargains and sit on them. They recognize that
they're taking a risk, but they have confidence that unless America
is through, stocks will rise again.
   These long-term investors do not expect quick profits. They are
not ``playing the market,'' that is, trying to outguess it. They are
content to let their stock ride with the tide that eventually must
develop.
   Meanwhile, the sad-sack investor is trying to pay the bills and
doesn't want to hear anything about stocks. He, or she, has sworn
off the market with a vow never to return, probably complaining that
it's a rigged game.
   Eventually, however, the market begins to rise again, even before
the economy recovers. The rise is quiet and steady; investor hopes
are restrained, and any speculative fervor is still a long way off.
   After a year of this the hapless investor, the perpetrator of
mistakes No. 1 and No. 2, begins to harbor a secret greed. Maybe he
could get even; maybe he could correct the great injustice done to
him.
   He ponders. He is about to commit Big Mistake No. 3. Resistance
worn down, quick money and maybe retribution in mind, and convinced
that there's no money to be made in his low-interest CDs, he
prepares to act.
   The trigger might be almost anything, overhearing a chance
remark, the excitement of the media, a telephone call from an old
broker friend, a tip on a sure thing.
   But, says Dohmen, our error-prone investor now feels almost
embarrassed to have sold at the bottom and then missed the upturn.
He waits and waits for lower prices. The market keeps rising. The
pressure on him rises.
   Finally, he is convinced. More significant, he is determined not
to commit the mistakes he made earlier that caused him to miss out
on a good thing. He makes the plunge. He has erred again.
   It is hard for such people not to err again. To correct the
problem they should, of course, learn to measure the market cycles
and accept the fact that there is risk rather than certainty.
   Then, says Dohmen, they should begin with a brand new attitude.
   ``To increase your success in the markets, it's best to forget
the past and pretend you are starting fresh.
   ``If there's a great stock which you unfortunately sold at lower
prices, forget where you sold it, and buy if you think it's an
opportunity.''
   Don't be embarrassed. ``The market doesn't know where you bought
it or sold it. It just continues to do what it does.''

   On Sept. 6, South Africa's governing National
Party faces probably its toughest election since it took power in
1948 and formally imposed the system known as apartheid, or
separation of the races. Some experts say the party could lose its
outright majority in Parliament under a two-pronged assault from the
left and right. Here are profiles of its two resurgent rivals, the
far-right Conservative Party and the anti-apartheid Democratic Party.

<TEXT>
   The far-right Conservative Party's
solution to South Africa's political and racial turmoil is simple:
strengthen apartheid.
   The blunt call for strict segregation at a time of political
uncertainty earned the Conservatives 26 percent of the country's
white vote in 1987, a figure almost certain to rise in the elections
for a new Parliament on Sept. 6.
   ``We are not prepared to share power with blacks, coloreds or
Indians,'' the party's leader, Andries Treurnicht, wrote recently.
``That will undoubtedly lead to black majority government, a
racially integrated South Africa, the further impoverishment of
whites.''
   The Conservatives hold 23 of the 166 elected seats in the
dominant white chamber of Parliament and could gain at least 20.
They were given a boost by the resignation Aug. 14 of President P.W.
Botha and his bitter criticism of his own National Party, which has
held power since 1948.
   The Conservatives control dozens of local governments where they
have been reimposing hard-line apartheid measures despite
controversy and stiff resistance.
   The National Party has joined the chorus of critics attacking the
return of ``petty apartheid'' measures, but the Conservatives say
they are merely enforcing laws placed on the books by the
Nationalists.
   In Boksburg, an industrial town 12 miles southeast of
Johannesburg, the Conservative-controlled city council re-segregated
the town park, athletic fields, municipal halls and other facilities
last year.
   Blacks organized a consumer boycott in December that initially
looked as if it would cripple the town economically. Political
observers, both black and white, predicted Boksburg would produce an
embarrassing failure for the Conservatives.
   But the city council stood firm, and the boycott has weakened
over time. On a recent weekday afternoon, black shoppers far
outnumbered whites at the largest supermarket on the town's main
street.
   The Conservatives now point proudly to Boksburg as proof of its
ability to withstand pressure.
   ``We are fighting for the white man's future and we don't mind a
little pressure,'' said Sias Nothnagel, the Conservative candidate
for Parliament in Boksburg.
   In its pre-election newsletter, the Conservatives compare
Boksburg with Hillbrow, a ``whites-only'' section of Johannesburg,
into which thousands of blacks have moved illegally in recent years.
   The National Party government has said it might legally open
Hillbrow and a few other select neighborhoods to all races.
   Boksburg's crime rate has been falling, while Hillbrow has one of
the highest in the country, the Conservatives note. They say
property values are rising and new businesses are opening in
Boksburg, while housing prices are falling and shops are closing in
Hillbrow.
   ``Your Choice: Hillbrow (National Party) or Boksburg
(Conservative Party),'' a Conservative ad says.
   The message has strong appeal for many rural and blue-collar
whites who see the National Party's limited race reforms as
capitulation to the black majority.
   ``Why are so many people voting for the Conservative Party?''
asked Acting President F.W. de Klerk, the leader of the National
Party. ``It's not because they think the policy can work. It's
because they feel endangered.''
   Blacks are coming to the cities in increasing numbers and in many
cases are getting jobs previously held by whites. Most public
facilities have been integrated, especially in major cities.
   ``There is no way one can protect the white people in one
undivided state juxtaposed with an ever-increasing and overwhelming
number of blacks,'' said Treurnicht, who holds a doctorate in
theology and was a National Party Cabinet minister before resigning
in 1982 to organize the Conservatives.
   The Conservatives want to partition South Africa into one white
and several black ``nations'' as envisioned by Prime Minister
Hendrik Verwoerd, a Nationalist, in the early 1960s.
   The National Party government has created 10 black homelands, but
only four have accepted nominal ``independence'' and none is
recognized abroad. The government has given no indication it plans
to dismantle the homelands but has acknowledged that blacks living
outside these tribal territories should have some degree of
political rights.
   Whites account for only 5 million of South Africa's 37 million
people, but the Conservatives seek to claim all the major cities and
the best farmland for whites.
   ``We believe it is not too late to implement partition,'' said
Treurnicht. ``We will not be talked or intimidated out of that which
is legally ours, a part of South Africa where we will govern
ourselves.''

   With the help of
Hollywood-style glitz, South Africa's white liberals are trying to
shed their image as political amateurs and gain a powerbroking role
in the Sept. 6 elections for Parliament.
   The theme song from ``Chariots of Fire'' blared from loudspeakers
when the new Democratic Party was launched in April, welding three
separate and sometimes squabbling factions into one.
   Now, in the homestretch of the campaign, the Democrats have
unveiled South Africa's first cinematic political advertisements,
which appear amid film previews and cigarette commercials at movie
theaters nationwide.
   The films softpeddle the party's opposition to apartheid and its
call for black voting rights. Instead the ads accuse the National
Party government of economic mismanagement and corruption.
   The Democrats' roadside posters proclaim, ``We are the future.''
Ads in newspapers try to dispel the liberals' ``soft on security''
image by showing their candidates who were army or police officers.
   Whether the imagery will convert to votes remains to be seen, but
there is no question the Democrats have presented the National Party
with its most serious election threat from the left since it took
power in 1948.
   The Democrats hold 19 of the 166 elected seats in Parliament's
dominant white chamber. Party leaders hope to double this number,
and 30 seats seem possible to independent analysts.
   What the Democrats hope for is a hung Parliament, with the
National Party losing its outright majority in a two-pronged squeeze
from the left and from the far-right Conservative Party.
   In that event, it is at least possible the National Party would
form a coalition with the Democrats, agreeing to speed up reform in
exchange for support on legislation.
   For now, however, Nationalist candidates are contemptuous of the
new party, saying it is manipulated by militant anti-apartheid
organizations.
   ``Radicals and revolutionaries decide for them,'' said Law and
Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   The Democrats have three leaders, who agreed to a troika after
the unification of three anti-apartheid parties was completed in
April.
   According to opinion polls, the most widely favored of the three
is Denis Worrall, a former ambassador to Britain who quit the
National Party to protest the slow pace of reform. The other leaders
are Zach de Beer, a former corporate executive, and Wynand Malan, a
former National Party member of Parliament who now leads the
Democrats' most left-wing faction.
   ``Ordinary South Africans are hungering for a change,'' Worrall
said at a recent rally. ``They want to vote for the Democratic Party
because they know that in that way they are sending a message to our
fellow black South Africans, and the international community, that
we are ready to say goodbye and good riddance to apartheid.''
   On the key issue of black political rights, the Democratic Party
platform calls for negotiations with all factions _ including the
outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movement _ to draft a
new constitution.
   ``The DP constitution will protect our nation's various cultures,
religions and languages and will prevent majority domination,'' the
platform says. ``At the same time, it will allow every South African
a vote of equal value.''
   It calls for creation of a decentralized federal system and the
adoption of a bill of rights.
   The National Party has scoffed at the Democrats' professed
opposition to ``majority domination.''
   ``A federal system means majority rule in every federal state,''
said Acting President F.W. de Klerk, the National Party leader.
``Minority interests couldn't be protected. ... It can result in the
end of democracy.''
   One problem for the Democratic Party is that militant
anti-apartheid factions have little respect for it. Most black
activists, and white militants who work with them, oppose the entire
parliamentary structure because it excludes the black majority while
offering token power to Asians and people of mixed race, classified
as coloreds, who have their own separate chambers in Parliament.
   The Mass Democratic Movement, a coalition of several major
anti-apartheid groups, has been particularly critical of the
Democrats' decision to field candidates in races for the Asian
chamber. Militants have consistently called for boycotts of
elections for both non-white chambers since they were created in
1984.

<HEAD>Proposal to Redo Naples' Crumbling Historic Zone Worries Some</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NAPLES, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the Street of Small Hope, a forgotten
Italy lives on.
   Plump women hawk contraband cigarettes. Sewing machines whir in
sweatshops. Crammed-in families gather around supper tables just a
few feet from their beds.
   ``Here, nothing ever changes,'' notes shopkeeper Antonio
Vecchione, gesturing to the crumbling golden tenements lining
Naples' 16th-century Spanish Quarter.
   But recently, a dramatic proposal from a business group has put
in question the future of the Via Speranzella (Street of Small Hope)
and the rest of Naples' vast, dilapidated historical zone.
   The proposal, which envisions restoring or replacing thousands of
apartments, has prompted charges that one of Europe's biggest
historic areas could be erased and its occupants forced out.
   The city has not yet said how much of the plan it will approve.
However, the proposal's powerful backers _ and its critics _ believe
it has a good chance of becoming reality.
   ``We must intervene,'' declares Enzo Giustino, president of the
business group, known as ``The Kingdom of the Possible.'' ``The city
runs the risk of being left behind by history.''
   Neapolitans are intensely proud of their city, known for its
songs, its dark blue bay and its history, illustrated by medieval
castles and graceful palaces from the 15th to 18th centuries.
   But while Italy has become one of the world's biggest industrial
powers, Naples has remained dogged by unemployment, organized crime
and corruption. Its narrow streets are choked with traffic;
thousands of families live in dark, one-room apartments.
   ``The Kingdom of the Possible'' argues that only a dramatic step
by the private sector can save the cultural heritage, livability and
economy of the 1,780-acre historic center.
   ``The Italian state is the weakest in the world,'' Giustino
contended in an interview. ``It can't solve these problems by
itself.''
   Four years ago, Giustino, a construction executive and top
official of the Italian employers' association, assembled a
coalition of some of the city's most powerful forces _ banks,
construction firms and state-owned businesses.
   They enlisted dozens of architects, economists and sociologists
to study the historic center of the city of 1.2 million. Last year,
their 700-page proposal was presented to the Italian premier in Rome
and local officials.
   Cultural groups were outraged.
   Their biggest objection: The proposed demolition of at least 663
apartments to make room for parks, and the vast alteration or
destruction of 21,066 others to make room for more modern apartments.
   ``It would mean rubbing out a part of our history,'' protested
Guido Donatone of the national preservation group Italia Nostra.
   From a hillside, he pointed to the patchwork of gray and brown
roofs in the Spanish Quarter, named for the troops encamped there
when Naples was under Spanish rule in the early 1500s.
   ``This would all be skyscrapers,'' he said.
   Actually, the proposal would leave the renovation of the Spanish
Quarter to an architectural competition.
   The plan calls for keeping the character of most historic
neighborhoods. The exteriors of some buildings would be preserved
while apartments inside are rebuilt, for example, and others would
undergo extensive to minor restoration.
   But critics still fear the project would become dominated by
speculators, who in the past have covered Naples' hillsides with
anonymous concrete apartments.
   Giustino disagrees with that conclusion, saying his group has
presented all its ideas publicly.
   Critics also maintain the plan would force out artisans and
shopkeepers and prompt a rush of yuppies.
   Their concern is a proposal to finance the $7.4-billion project
by charging the owners of the apartments, assisted by state or local
funds.
   ``This has a social cost that is not quantified,'' said Maurizio
Barracco, a director of the cultural group Naples 99. ``How many
people will have to leave?''
   Despite the objections, the city is now drawing up renovation
proposals. Its urban planning chief, Maurizio Cardano, said, ``We
see the possibility of harmonizing their project with ours.
   ``We have a kind of strange attitude in Italy,'' he added. ``We
preserve everything without discrimination.''
   He added that improved living conditions were often more
important than preservation _ a view shared by people in the Spanish
Quarter.
   ``This is really degraded,'' said a dark-haired woman, indicating
the street outside her toiletries shop. ``It should all be knocked
down.''
   Shopkeeper Vecchione said he favored rebuilding but expected
little change.
   ``They haven't done it yet, I don't think they ever will,'' he
said with a shrug.

<TEXT>
   Guerrillas on the 6,000-foot
volcano looming over San Salvador's northwestern limits have turned
the working-class neighborhood of San Ramon into another
bullet-pocked battlefront.
   Contingents of leftist rebels have come down the slopes four
times in nine months to attack an army post in the center of the
ramshackle district of 30,000 people.
   The attacks are part of a year-old guerrilla campaign to bring
their war against the government into the capital. The Salvadoran
military says the guerrillas are making urban attacks because
they've failed elsewhere.
   But three of the four raids were staged in daylight, illustrating
the guerrillas' confidence in their ability to at least partly
neutralize the government's single greatest tactical advantage: air
power.
   ``Each time the combat is more fierce,'' said Marta Teresa
Figueroa, a vendor in the stall-lined market alley hard hit by the
fighting. ``It will happen again, and next time it will be worse.''
   She stood 10 feet from the spot where Santos Barrera, a
60-year-old mason, was killed by a bullet in the head the afternoon
of Aug. 1. That raid also left a soldier dead, another wounded and
two civilians _ a market-stall owner and her daughter _ wounded.
   Three of Barrera's grandchildren stood on the stoop of his humble
cinder-block home and told how they huddled under beds while the
fighting raged for two hours.
   Asked if the attacks made her afraid to come to the market,
16-year-old cheese-seller Julieta Lopez said, ``Yes. But necessity
obliges us to risk our lives.''
   Though residents of San Ramon have nothing against the soldiers
manning the post, several said there is a feeling that the
detachment should be withdrawn, or at least moved from the
district's center.
   Miguel Angel Rivera's arm is still bandaged and in a sling from a
wound he received in November during the first attack on San Ramon.
He had stopped to light a cigarette for a soldier when the first
fusillade exploded out of the darkness.
   The bone in the 21-year-old bus fare-taker's upper arm was
shattered, the artery severed and much of the nerve destroyed.
   ``They should remove the post to a more isolated place,'' he
said, standing a block from the one-story house that serves as the
15-man detachment's headquarters and barracks.
   The house is distinguished from its neighbors by green-and-black
camouflage daub and sandbag positions at its corners.
   ``There are too many people around here _ the market, the school,
the church, people who have nothing to do with the conflict _ and
things happen to them,'' Rivera said.
   Sgt. Mario Ventura Lopez, a stocky 51-year-old former
paratrooper, commands the post. A 32-year army veteran, Ventura lost
a lung from a wound suffered in combat with the rebels in 1982.
   Standing next to a patched hole in the wall where an antitank
rocket struck in the previous attack, Ventura said his detachment
was there ``to protect the community from these terrorist
delinquents.''
   He estimated that about 100 rebels took part in the attack Aug.
1. His troops were reinforced soon after it began by scores of 1st
Brigade soldiers on constant patrol around the San Salvador
volcano's base.
   A UH-1H helicopter with two M-60 machine-guns _ one of 70
U.S.-supplied choppers in the Salvadoran air force _ circled about
3,000 feet above San Ramon shortly after the battle began, too high
for its gunfire to be effective.
   The helicopters aren't coming in as close as they used to because
the guerrillas have acquired several hundred Soviet-designed
Dragunov sniper rifles, which have a range of 800 yards, compared
with about 300 yards for an ordinary assault rifle. The helicopters
have been taking more hits and abandoning more missions.
   With government air power reduced, the rebels have been able to
launch more daytime attacks than at any time in the last four years
of the conflict that began nearly a decade ago.
   Ventura contended his post is getting ever-greater acceptance and
support from the local people.
   ``They're tiring of seeing the way the terrorists' actions affect
the civilian population,'' he said.
   But a dozen residents interviewed indicated little or no
animosity toward the attackers. It was clear, however, they were
sick of the war.
   ``One asks oneself whey the two sides are fighting, and one
doesn't find an answer,'' said a produce vendor who preferred not to
give her name.
   Even Rivera says he has nothing against the rebel who wounded him
so severely.
   ``It was just bad luck,'' he said.

<HEAD>Economic Pressure Mounts on Palestinians in West Bank</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In days past, weddings in Hamad Badr's family
called for the slaughter of 20 sheep. But when a brother got married
three months ago, two were sacrifice enough.
   The wedding was a victim of the 20-month intefadeh, or uprising
against Israeli occupation, which has squeezed livelihoods and
altered lives for Palestinians throughout the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   Repeated strikes by Palestinian workers, curfews imposed by the
Israeli army and a drop in tourism have slashed incomes.
   As the economy has declined, the Jordanian dinar _ the key
currency in the occupied lands _ has plunged in value by 50 percent,
further ravaging savings and paychecks.
   Badr, whose family has owned a four-table restaurant in
Jerusalem's walled Old City for 25 years, said his business has been
devastated.
   ``Before, if you wanted to get food, you'd have to wait outside
for half an hour,'' said Badr, who now closes for the day at noon to
comply with the orders of clandestine uprising leaders.
   ``Today you see: in a half an hour, we sold only two Coca-Colas.''
   Nearly all Palestinians insist that the struggle for daily bread
has not weakened their will to resist Israeli occupation. But the
dinar's recent plunge coincided with a seeming drop of intensity in
the uprising and an increase in factional squabbling in Palestinian
ranks.
   ``If you are angry and hungry, you have to satisfy your hunger
first,'' explained Tarik Said, who owns a photo shop near Badr's
restaurant.
   But he said that rather than forcing an end to resistance, more
violence is the likely result.
   An official of Israel's military government in the occupied lands
said economic hardship was beginning to be felt in a widespread way
for the first time but that it was too early to say it would mean an
end to the uprising.
   Samir Saleh, an economist at the West Bank's Bir Zeit University,
said Palestinian incomes have fallen and buying power is probably
half what it was when the uprising began in December 1987.
   Average incomes per capita declined by 25 percent from a
pre-uprising level of $1,000 a month.
   Saleh said the falling value of the dinar ``has disastrous
effects.'' The currency has been a major means of payment and
savings for Palestinians since Jordan lost the West Bank to Israel
in 1967.
   ``Here people only believed in God and the dinar,'' said Nabil
Feidy, a money changer on Salah al-Din St. in east Jerusalem.
   The dinar was worth $3 early last year, but fell to less than $1
in July before recovering recently to about $1.50.
   Hospital workers, college teachers, Islamic preachers and tens of
thousands of private employees still earn wages in dinars, and most
paychecks have not risen as the dinar's purchasing power declined.
   Sheik Hassan Ali, an Islamic preacher who dropped by to visit
Badr, said he was forced to move his wife and two children out of
their apartment and into a single room of his father's house.
   ``My salary is 160 dinars,'' said Ali, noting that it used to be
worth about $480 but now is worth $200.
   ``The impact on people here is devastating,'' said Feidy, the
money changer. ``The worst part is that people have their dinars in
Jordanian banks and they can't bring them.''
   In an effort to stem the flow of orders and money from the
Palestine Liberation Organization, Israel sharply curtailed travel
and financial transfers across the Jordan River. Palestinians can
now bring in only 200 dinars a person per month.
   Israel has countered a tax boycott by Palestinians with increased
fees on vehicles.
   Abu Jafaar, a teacher who has seen his salary cut in half because
of the frequent strikes and school closures, said fees on his car
have risen to the equivalent of about $700 a year from $80.
   He has opened a small grocery store in his home.

   Every year scores of books are banned in schools
and libraries across America, usually at the behest of parents who
find their contents offensive. Here's a look at some of the works
that have been censored and the efforts by some writers and
librarians to fight back.

<TEXT>
   This week more than 40 million public school children and 13
million college students begin returning to their classrooms. But in
many of these halls of learning, the shadow of censorship hangs over
that source of light and knowledge, the library.
   Freedom of speech and the press, to write and to read whatever
you like, remains protected in America. But those freedoms are
frequently challenged. Public and school librarians often feel under
siege.
   Books as seemingly harmless as Mark Twain's ``Huckleberry Finn''
and L. Frank Baum's ``The Wizard of Oz'' have been challenged. Some
of the most-frequent targets are John Steinbeck's ``Of Mice and
Men,'' Kurt Vonnegut's ``Slaughterhouse Five'' and J.D. Salinger's
``Catcher in the Rye.''
   But, as the school board in Eliot, Maine, said in rejecting a
parental request to ban Judy Blume's novel ``Forever'' as
pornographic: ``... while you have the right to censor material for
your child, we do not believe you have that right for other children
in the system.''
   It's estimated that since Johann Gutenberg invented the printing
press five centuries ago, some 25 million individual books have been
written and published, almost a third in the English language.
Worldwide, an additional 350,000 titles are published every year, at
least 50,000 in the United States.
   To house and protect this multiplicity of ideas, the United
States supports more than 115,000 libraries of all kinds.
   Judith Krug, who writes and edits the American Library
Association's Newsletter on Intellectual Freedom, chronicles those
individuals and groups ``who attempt to remove those materials from
public availability and accessibility.''
   ``This is a constitutional republic, but the constitutional
republic does not work unless the electorate is enlightened,'' she
said. ``We are a nation of self-governors, but in order to make
appropriate decisions we need to have information available and
accessible.''
   In three weeks, authors and celebrities will visit bookstores and
libraries across the country to read publicly excerpts from banned
books as they did when Salman Rushdie's ``The Satanic Verses''
raised such a furor.
   In Los Angeles, for instance, PEN Center West, an author's group,
will meet in Malibu for readings of banned books. Among the invited
are Steve Allen, Alice Walker, Martin Sheen, Ray Bradbury, Hope
Lange, Alvin Toffler, Larry King and Billy Crystal.
   In the 1986-87 academic year, People for the American Way
reported 153 attempts to remove books from public schools or
libraries in 41 states, 37 percent of them successful.
   In the year ended May 1989, the American Library Association
reported that more than 100 books were brought up on charges,
including Jim Davis' ``Garfield: His Nine Lives.''
   That cartoon book was challenged in Saginaw, Mich., by a parent
who found some of the language and drawings offensive.
   Said Stephen James, assistant director for the Saginaw County
Public Library, ``It was intended to be a children's book. But some
of the language was challenging.''
   A parent objected to one illustration Davis had captioned, ``She
stormed, she fumed, she kicked ass.'' The drawing depicts a woman,
kicking a man and sending him tumbling.
   The library review committee decided to keep the book, but in the
adult section.
   It has been a rough time for James and the Saginaw libraries.
They received 11 challenges from May to December 1988.
   The Saginaw authorities reported to the library association,
``Although no evidence of an organized censorship effort has been
found as yet ... the sheer number of challenges placed a clear
burden on the library and to many seemed to suggest further
trouble.''
   The first was Larry King's ``Tell It to the King.'' The
complainant resented what she felt was foul language and called it
``an insult to one's intelligence.'' Said James, ``We decided to
keep it on the shelves. Our librarians felt the quotes were
well-handled.''
   Among those that followed were Alice Walker's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, ``The Color Purple,'' and another children's
book, ``Katie Morag and the Tiresome Ted'' by Mairi Hedderwick, the
story of a child's jealousy when a new baby arrives. Why? The
mother's breast is exposed as she holds a smiling baby, but the baby
is not suckling. The complaint asked that the illustration be
covered.
   The woman who complained about ``Sir Gawain and the Loathly
Lady,'' by Selina Hasting, found the book charming but asked the
library to ``white out'' a sentence that contained profanity.
   The library's review committee could not find anything
pornographic in ``Public Smiles, Private Tears,'' by Helen Van
Slyke, or anything objectionable in ``King Stork'' by Howard Pyle.
The review committee said:
   ``Howard Pyle is a classic children's author who was very much
respected in his time. His text reflects values and practices we now
find repugnant in the same way that other classic books
(`Huckleberry Finn,' `Legend of Sleepy Hollow,' `Dr. Doolittle,'
`Little House on the Prairie,' etc.) contain racist and sexist
attitudes or words that belong to a bygone age. Mr. Pyle is true to
the spirit of folklore in his original folktale.''
   Saginaw received a complaint because the Bible and books on
Christianity were shelved with books on myths and other religions,
but that is where the Dewey Decimal System places them.
   What about a picture book for children, named ``Where's Waldo?'',
in which young readers scan through a busy page of a hundred or so
small illustrations of tiny characters to find Waldo? He is either
lost in the illustrations of people doing things at a track meet or
a department store. But among the illustrations, one woman found a
little boy, peeking under a curtain at a woman in a department store
dressing room. As in the other cases, the review committee refused
to ban the book.

<TEXT>the book.    And, finally, Saginaw was asked to remove
a book called ``Young, Gay and Proud,'' an anthology of short stories,
poems and essays supportive of teen-agers who have homosexual tendencies.
   The complaint was filed by David A. Morel, the father of two young
daughters and a vice president of the 25-member Saginaw chapter of the
American Family Association, a religiously oriented group based in Tupelo,
Miss., formerly known as the National Federation for Decency. The chapter
embraces a principle known in the South as WRAP, White Ribbons Against
Pornography.    Morel, a church-going Baptist, objected to the book on
pornographic grounds. ``They go into detail on how to have sex between
two males. They get very explicit. ... Personally I think gay sex is wrong.
But there is no one out there who would accept my opinion, based on the
Bible, which points out it's wrong. But that doesn't carry much weight
in this country anymore. ... The country is founded on Christian principles,
but has deviated from it.''    Morel says pornography is addictive
in the same way alcohol and drugs are, and fears for his daughters' safety
as they grow up. ``I think we are all horrible rotten sinners,'' he said.
``The Bible says the heart of man is deceitfully wicked, and I think if
you dig deep enough we'll find that's true.''    The library reviewers
rejected his appeal. ``We felt, in fact, it was not enticing youngsters,
that it was intended to promote a sort of healthy self-image and that in
fact was a good thing to do once a person had made a personal decision,''
James said. ``We decided to keep it in the collection.''    It is only
one of some 400,000 books in the five Saginaw libraries. But it is part
of the diversity of books that can be found in any public library.   
``Many Voices, Many Books: Strength Through Diversity'' is the theme of
National Banned Books Week, Sept.23-30, sponsored by the library association.
``There are a lot of ideas out there I don't agree with,'' said Ms. Krug,
the association's guardian. ``But I don't think you can fight ideas
unless you know what they are. The solution to a bad idea is a good idea,
and ideas do build on one another.''    Libraries once practiced a concept
of balance, both sides of a controversy. But those were simpler days, when
there were only two sides. Things are so complex, opinions so varied, that
librarians now embrace the concept of diversity. But that does not keep
them out of trouble.    For instance, the library association filed one
of the record number of 80-plus amicus curiae briefs with the Supreme Court
in the recent Missouri abortion case. It was somehow listed on the abortion
side, and may have lost some members because of it.    The Missouri statute
would have limited the ability of publicly supported health-care officials
to ``counsel or encourage'' a woman to have an abortion. ``We have materials
in our collections that do just that,'' said Ms. Krug, ``often in very
strong terms. Our concern was just keeping them available on the shelf.
``If we had lost on that issue, which we did not, it would have
been the first time in our history that government had said that you may
not have some kind of information in publicly supported institutions.''
   Pat Conroy was understandably angry when his hometown turned against
his best-selling ``Prince of Tides,'' the story of a South Carolina shrimper's
family. ``Anytime the extreme right or the extreme left gets in, books
are always the first to go,'' he said.    It started when English teacher
Judy Fitzgerald of the St. Andrews Parish assigned the book to her advanced
English class and asked them to obtain their parents' permission, a standard
operating procedure. After all, the class had already read ``The Scarlet
Letter'' with no objection.    But the Rev. Elton Johnson Jr., himself
a former English teacher, objected, calling it ``trashy pulp pornography.''
He said he scanned only the first 50 of 567 pages and found enough explicit
language to ``gag a maggot.''    Some students and faculty rebelled
and put up signs saying, ``Sorry, this quote had to be censored due to
the fact that you might learn something.''    But despite the fact that
many of the students read the book anyway, and the school board stopped
short of banning the book, the protest pressured teachers to take more
care in assignments. Fitzgerald felt she had to withdraw the assignment.
   ``My students are writers in training,'' she said. ``It's very important
for them to see that this dream of success can be achieved out of South
Carolina and that they're not just hicks studying the realm of the untouchable.''
   Said author Conroy, ``This will scare teachers from assigning books
with any controversy at all. They're cutting the 20th century from literature.''
   At the base of many current censorship attempts is the Supreme Court
ruling that upheld the right of a Missouri school board to censor a student
newspaper. The extension of that ruling to school libraries is being tested
in Florida.    Despite the constant battle to preserve the sanctity of
the shelves, the passion for censorship continues unabated.    In Louisville,
Colo., an elementary school banned Halloween when parents said it promoted
devil worship. The ban was lifted when other parents protested it was depriving
their children of enjoyable activities.    But in North Pole, Alaska,
named after Santa's home base, a school banned the use of the word Christmas
in the holiday season on the basis that it violates separation of church
and state. The ban remains.

   He was, he says, the best and he has a fat
scrapbook to back up the boast. Hyman ``Pinky'' Ginsberg, the king
of the gate crashers, at age 84 isn't testing many ticket takers,
but he jokes that he's looking forward to his next big challenge,
St. Peter at the Pearly Gates.

   Pinky Ginsberg doesn't get around much
anymore. The days of dining with royalty, infiltrating big events
and thumbing his nose at officials are gone.
   ``I don't know who remembers me anymore,'' he says. ``There was a
time when they all knew me, though. There was a time when my name
was magic.''
   The man who once walked into Adolf Hitler's office and asked for
an autograph, attended the coronation of King George VI, crashed 37
World Series, 12 presidential inaugurations, eight Olympics and many
other events is a little short of magic these days.
   Hyman Ginsberg, 84, who bills himself as the world's greatest
gate crasher, now spends his days in a tiny apartment on the edge of
the French Quarter.
   An old man's gait has slowed his travels. So has an old man's
bankroll.
   ``Social Security. It's enough to keep you from starving, but not
by much,'' he says. ``I get $400 a month and that doesn't go far. In
my time I made and lost $15 million. I spent $100,000 on a little
redhead so quick you wouldn't believe it.
   ``In those days it came easy and it went easy. I was a bookie. I
owned several nightclubs in the French Quarter. Chez Paris on
Bourbon Street, that was mine. I owned a place called Punch and
Judy's, another one next to Arnaud's Restaurant.''
   His thin fingers thumb through his scrapbook, fondling the
clippings that yellow there. Clippings in French, Spanish, German,
English, along with letters and photographs, fill the book and
testify to his many adventures.
   The legend on the front of the book reads: ``Album of Fantasy,
Alright _ Let's Have It, Fantastic _ Fabulous, Step &amp; Peep into the
Wonderful World and the Pleasant Life of Pinky the Bum. Smiling
Pinky Ginsberg, King of the Gate Crashers, International
Personality, Professional Gourmet, Wine Sipper and Food Taster.''
   The citations making him honorary mayor, colonel, senator,
sheriff, cop and quarterback are taped to the wall.
   ``I can document everything I tell you,'' he says. ``I have
letters from people. See this pin? President Bush sent it to me when
he was vice president. I've met 12 presidents, crashed 12
inaugurations. I used to walk in and out of the White House like I
owned the joint. All I did was carry some papers under my arm and
they thought I was a senator or something. You can't do that now.
The assassinations changed all of that.''
   The last thing Ginsberg crashed was the 1988 Republican National
Convention.
   ``Easier than I would have guessed,'' he says. ``I just copied
the pass and walked right in. They put me through the metal detector
to see if I was carrying a gun, but nobody even tried to stop me.''
   Ginsberg began his gate-crashing career at the World Series in
1920.
   ``It was Cleveland against Brooklyn,'' he says. ``I came from a
poor family and didn't have the 50 cents for a ticket. I bought six
newspapers for two cents each, wadded them up and started a fire.
When the guy on the gate ran out to put it out, I went in.''
   He crashed many other major sporting events, he said. Super Bowls
_ ``Nothing to it.'' The Muhammad Ali-Leon Spinks fight in the
Superdome _ ``A piece of cake.'' The 1988 NCAA Final Four in the
same building couldn't keep him out either.
   ``It's just a matter of looking things over, figuring out the
best way in and them acting like you know what you're doing,'' he
says. ``Once you start, don't stop and don't look back.''
   Ginsberg was in Berlin in 1939 and decided he had to get into
Adolf Hitler's office. With six white shirts, which he says were
hard to get in Germany then, he bribed two guards to turn their
backs while he walked past.
   ``I went in and there he was sitting at the desk,'' Ginsberg
recalls. ``Now I sure didn't want to introduce myself with a name
like Hyman Ginsberg, so I just gave him a big `Heil, Hitler!' and
asked for his autograph. He hit the ceiling. Bells started going
off. A couple of guys came in and grabbed me and threw me out on the
street.''
   He crashed King George's coronation in England wearing a rented
tuxedo decorated with a yard of red ribbon and three rows of medals
bought at a pawn shop. The same ploy got him into the wedding of the
daughter of Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.
   He got into a lot of Sugar Bowls and a couple of Cotton Bowls
with a $2 camera and a `Press' button he says he got off a Coke
machine.
   But his best ploys won't work for him anymore, he says. Nobody
will believe an 84-year-old firefighter or cop or doctor might be
rushing into an event.
   ``I always had an angle,'' he says. ``I had a knack for getting
along with people and for getting by people. If they had had
television when I was in top form, I'd be a household word today. I
was the best at one time. Everybody said so.''
   His career isn't over, Ginsberg says, although he concedes time
has turned against him and all the fancy security and electronic
devices have made it harder for anyone to crash a gate.
   ``If it's big enough, I could still come up with something. I
still like a challenge. You know, they tell me that St. Peter is a
hard man to con and that's a hard gate to crash. Hell, I guess I'll
give it a try, though, when the time comes.''

   If some Eastern bloc countries are undergoing
reforms, Romania remains under the thumb of Nicolae Ceausescu, whose
Stalinist-style government does not tolerate dissent. Indeed, even
with shortages of food and energy becoming more severe, Romania is
shutting itself off from the outside world, and foreigners inside
the country are treated with suspicion.

   On a languid Sunday in this once-glorious
European city, a foreign car is the center of attention as it pulls
into the long evening shadow of the medieval cathedral.
   From a safe distance people stare, mindful of laws that mandate
the reporting of any unauthorized conversations with foreigners.
   A father leans over to his son, muttering, in English, that the
man behind the steering wheel is a ``driver.''
   A bolder spirit, a well-dressed woman, approaches the strangers,
asking in flawless French if they will change some money. She
retreats crestfallen back into the shadows when they refuse.
   In a nearby cafe, a waitress wearily explains to the foreigners
that there are no snacks, no coffee, no tea and no mineral water, a
familiar scenario across Romania today.
   Just ``soc'' (colored water that tastes of chemicals), she says.
   An aging band grinds out slow, almost bluesy versions of
Hungarian ballads as unsmiling guests drown any sorrow in barely
audible chatter and free-flowing ``cognac.''
   Romania 1989: a European country where European visitors are an
object of suspicion for authorities and mute curiosity for friendly
but frightened citizens, a polyglot nation where European cultures
blended for centuries and now vanish behind official intolerance.
   In Cluj and other towns, stylish but shoddily built apartments
sprout in record time, while old villages crumble away, depopulating
``naturally'' as their lone stores and schoolhouses are closed.
   Across the fertile land, rationing is in force and food stores
grow barer with each year of the vaunted ``golden era'' of President
Nicolae Ceausescu. Yet officials spouting statistics about Romania's
advances on the march to Utopia blandly assure foreigners the meat
they cannot see on shelves is available, just stored in
refrigerators.
   Last winter, the fifth in a row of government-imposed energy
rationing, six Communists who once held senior posts implored
Ceausescu to change course.
   ``Romania is and remains a European country,'' they insisted in a
letter that later reached the West. ``You started changing the
geography of the countryside, but you cannot remove Romania to
Africa.''
   The 71-year-old Ceausescu, the visibly healthy and unchallenged
ruler since 1965, swiftly squashed the protest before it had any
chance of spreading to other party members.
   According to Western diplomats in Bucharest, the six were
repeatedly interrogated. Refusing to recant, three were exiled
outside the capital and the three others were removed from
comfortable homes into rougher quarters in the city. Police guards
reportedly prevent diplomats from approaching the new abodes.
   Mircea Raceanu, the adopted son of one of the six and a senior
diplomat who served six years in the United States, was arrested and
charged with treason as media articles and rallies rammed home the
dangers of contact with foreigners.
   No one knows where Raceanu is, and a question about him clearly
rattled officials at a news conference during the Warsaw Pact summit
in Bucharest in July.
   Authors of other protests share this anonymous fate, according to
Romanian emigres and Western diplomats. Former Cluj university
professor Doina Cornea has not been seen since June 6, following her
third protest letter to Ceausescu.
   Writers Andrei Plesu and Mircea Dinescu were under virtual house
arrest after penning protests, while another writer, Dan Desliu,
spent two weeks in a Bucharest madhouse for his dissent.
   And the march to Utopia continues, cutting deep into the peasant
traditions of Romanians, and into the culture and mutual tolerance
nurtured for centuries by 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians and 200,000
Germans in the rolling hills of Transylvania.
   In German villages, freshly painted lettering over courtyard
gates proudly proclaims the family of the owner, and the date the
house was built. In Cluj, Hungarian-language theater and other
cultures still thrive, to judge by posters advertising the events.
   But the city's Hungarian consulate was closed last year in the
escalating war of words between Bucharest and Budapest, whose
traditional rivalry over Transylvania is exacerbated by sharp
ideological divisions over the future shape of communism.
   A Cluj schoolteacher now in Hungary, one of thousands of such
refugees from Romania, tearfully recalled how efforts to preserve
vestiges of Hungarian tradition in class were slowly eroded by
reprimands and the appearance of more and more Romanian-speaking
pupils.

   Transylvania's ethnic Germans, hard-working farmers who have
tilled the fertile soil for centuries, are hemorrhaging out of the
country at the rate of 13,000 to 15,000 a year _ and would go faster
if Romania let them.
   Fear of endangering this emigration once muted West German
protest at Romania's human rights record. Now, Bonn is as outspoken
as other capitals. Emigration has not suffered, diplomats say, but
the wife of the West German consul was brutally kicked and beaten by
a uniformed policeman on a Bucharest street this spring.
   Ceausescu is isolated, too, from most Eastern bloc nations. To
visitors, but not in articles, Soviet journalists based in Bucharest
make plain their distaste for a familiarly Stalinist government.
They say they are watched and harassed by Romania's KGB, the dreaded
Securitate, but insist open hostility would only ruin relations and
any chance at helping to shape the country's future.
   Ceausescu firmly believes his brand of Stalinism offers more
social security and Marxist equality than Mikhail Gorbachev's
topsy-turvy reforms or Hungary's open dash toward free elections and
a free market economy.
   As proof, his supporters cite surreal statistics _ that living
standards are 135 times higher than in 1945, that 675,000 new
apartments are available under this Five Year Plan, that industrial
investments will increase 30 percent and the annual harvest surge
from 30 million to 40 million tons a year by 1995.
   Failing to mention the cost in shortages caused by food exports
from this bountiful land, Romanian officials boast of their unique
feat of repaying the entire foreign debt, $11 billion, from 1980 to
last March.
   Consumers have noticed no improvement in the stores since. But
their diet of propaganda proclaims proudly that, for the first time
in its turbulent history, Romania is beholden to no one.
   Credit for all this goes to Ceausescu, who is the object of a
strong personality cult and has installed several close relatives _
including his wife, Elena, son, Nicu, and brother, Ilie _ in
powerful positions.
   The draft program for a November party congress describes him as
the ``most beloved son of the Romanian people, the man of genius and
architect of modern Romania.''
   ``We can and must assert most powerfully that only socialism
could make such grandiose and wonderful achievements of our nation
possible,'' Ceausescu insisted at a Communist Party meeting in June.
   Private ownership, small farms and the encouragement of
profit-seeking entrepreneurs, he emphasizes, are not communism.
Neither are ``any attempts to denigrate socialism.''
   Western diplomats in Bucharest say Ceausescu cites the massacre
of pro-democracy demonstrators in China or the deaths of protesters
in the Soviet city of Tbilisi as evidence that his policies are
correct _ he does not kill, so therefore criticism of Romania over
human rights is misplaced.
   Given the grip of the Securitate, and the disappearance of the
leaders of a spontaneous protest by 10,000 workers in November 1987,
it seems unlikely that popular unrest will erupt.
   Romania has weak democratic traditions _ a favorite proverb has
it that ``a stooped back cannot be broken by a sword'' _ and outside
influences that might stir mass protest are few.
   Ceausescu, once an inveterate traveler courted in the White House
and Buckingham Palace as a communist maverick, has made no trips
abroad this year, and receives no top visitors from the West these
days.
   Western diplomats report that even Romanian officials or
intellectuals once permitted carefully reported contacts with
foreigners have all but stopped attending embassy parties.
   There are no Western or even Soviet bloc newspapers broadly on
sale, and imports _ and hence contact with Western businessmen _ are
dwindling now that fresh foreign credit has been outlawed. Romanian
TV works two hours a night on a heavy diet of Ceausescu, and the
more interesting offerings from Bulgarian, Yugoslav, Soviet or
Hungarian television can be received or understood only on the
nation's fringes.
   ``It's just becoming a dinosaur of a country, if you like,'' says
a Western diplomat who asked not to be identified.
   A Romanian official counters, ``We had to cut ourselves off.''
   ``When you're getting beaten from all sides, you withdraw to a
place where it's safe,'' he adds, smiling. ``We'll see who's right.''

   Could a Welsh prince and his followers have
settled in the heartland of America three centuries before
Christopher Columbus reached the New World? That's the stuff of
local legend in southern Indiana. While most scholars debunk the
theory, a lot of questions remain unanswered and much of the
evidence has disappeared.

   On a rugged bluff overlooking the Ohio
River, a site known locally as the ``Devil's Backbone,'' natural
debris accumulated over the centuries shrouds a historical mystery.
   Popular legend says that there lie the remains of a large stone
fort and a lost colony of Welshmen who sailed to America three
centuries before Christopher Columbus.
   In 1799, early settlers found six skeletons wearing breastplates
with a Welsh coat of arms. Indian legends told of ``yellow-haired
giants'' who settled in Kentucky, southern Indiana, southern Ohio
and Tennessee _ a region they knew as ``the Dark and Forbidden
Land.''
   Archaeologists, debunking the legend, say better evidence
indicates native American Indians once conducted a vigorous trading
network nearby and buried their dead on the bluff.
   The site and its shadowy history has lain virtually undisturbed
since 1940, when the U.S. Army purchased 10,000 acres to build a
munitions plant.
   The Department of Defense is expected to relinquish almost 900
acres as part of a cost-cutting plan. The state of Indiana will have
the first option to buy.
   Both the Charlestown Chamber of Commerce and the state Department
of Natural Resources have called for a state park on the land, which
includes the peninsula 3 miles east of Charlestown.
   ``The older folks told children not to scale its walls, that the
devil had put a curse on the place,'' wrote Margaret Sweeney in her
1967 book, ``Fact, Fiction and Folklore of Southern Indiana.''
   ``In spite of the warning, many youngsters invaded the stronghold
and came away with broken bones, bruises, cuts or even completely
bewitched for investigating `Old Scratch's quarters.'''
   Fourteen miles upstream from Louisville, Ky., the craggy hill
rises abruptly from the Indiana shoreline. Fourteen Mile Creek runs
behind the hill, creating a narrow strip of land where it flows
along the larger river.
   The peninsula is less than 20 feet wide at the top and falls off
abruptly on either side to the Ohio River and the creek. The
resulting pear-shape bluff has a flat top of 5 to 7 acres that is
almost inaccessible.
   The earliest survey of the area, by state geologist E.T. Cox and
his assistant, William Borden, in 1873 revealed a prehistoric
fortification on the hilltop. An artificial limestone wall, 150 feet
long and 75 feet high in some places, stood along the front and one
side of the hill where the cliffs could be scaled, Cox said in his
report.
   The walls no longer exist, the area's early settlers having
carried the huge, unmortared stones away to build foundations,
bridges and fences seen throughout the county's rolling countryside.
   Local legend says the walls were built by followers of Prince
Madoc, who led an expedition away from his native Wales in the late
12th century and was never seen again. Oral tradition says they
landed in America, settling briefly in Tennessee before moving on to
Kentucky and southern Indiana.
   ``In my opinion, you couldn't find a better legend than this,''
says Dana Olson of Jeffersonville, an amateur historian and author
of ``Prince Madoc: Founder of Clark County, Indiana.''
   ``You've got princes and kings, and gold and silver, and wars. It
would make a great movie.''
   Olson's book says Madoc was a son of Welsh King Owain Gwynedd and
one of his brightest naval commanders. Madoc's skills and curiosity
took him to France, Spain, Venice and other Mediterranean ports _
and on at least two trips to the Americas in the period from 1165 to
1169.
   When Gwynedd died in 1169, his sons began to feud over the
throne. A disgusted Madoc, looking for more tranquil surroundings,
sailed from Lundy Island south of Wales with three of his brothers
and 10 ships.
   They are listed as missing in Britain's ancient maritime logs.
   Legend says they landed in Mobile Bay in 1170 and traveled up the
Alabama River to where it meets the Coosa River, close to Alabama's
borders with Georgia and Tennessee.
   According to Cherokee tradition, they settled there and
intermarried with native Indians, building five stone forts in the
Chattanooga area. Treasure hunters have found Roman coins, European
oil lamps and goblets among the forts, Olson says.
   However, excavations conducted by the anthropology department at
the University of Tennessee concluded one of the structures, known
as Old Stone Fort, was built in the third century A.D. by an Indian
culture that would have predated Madoc.
   No Welsh artifacts were found to substantiate the persistent
Madoc legend.

   ``In professional archaeological circles, it's kind of
pooh-poohed,'' says Steve Cox, curator of the Tennessee State
Museum. ``There's no archaeological evidence. That's really all that
we have to go on in the prehistoric period.''
   The legend says the Welsh Indians were forced out of Tennessee by
the Cherokee Indians. Three separate northerly routes took them into
Kentucky and the Ohio River Valley.
   American Indians apparently first spread the tale of a race of
White Indians who lived in the Falls of the Ohio area, where Madoc's
followers may have established their largest settlement.
   George Rogers Clark, the founder of Clarksville, Ind., first
heard the story from Tobacco, a chief of the Piankeshaws. He told of
a great battle between the Red Indians and White Indians on the Ohio
River's Sand Island where all the White Indians were slain.
   Maj. John Harrison, among others, has told of an extensive
graveyard in that area, where thousands of human bones were buried
in such confusion as to suggest a battle. The graveyard, if it
existed, has been washed away.
   Some of Clark County's earliest settlers reportedly found ancient
coins and European armor, some bearing the Welsh coat of arms. All
of that armor has disappeared.
   Clark found some skeletons adorned in armor that he thought were
ancient Welshmen and jotted down his findings in his personal
memoirs, Olson says. A copy of this book, in Clark's own hand, was
stolen years ago from the Jeffersonville public library.
   ``Baird's History of Clark County'' says that a tombstone, with
the date 1186, was found in Jeffersonville in the 1800s. Early
pioneers reportedly found native Indians throughout the interior who
could converse in the Welsh language.
   A skull taken from Sand Island in the 1800s was pronounced by a
Dr. Beckwith as ``not that of an Indian.'' Beckwith's qualifications
are not known.
   None of the evidence has been scientifically examined or
confirmed. In fact, virtually all of it has mysteriously disappeared.
   ``I wish I could reproduce everything that's been found or that
it had been put in a museum,'' Olson says. ``There are no museums
here.''
   Without such proof, archaeologists and other experts have their
doubts.
   ``Where you find prehistoric or human occupation you normally
find a range of evidence, such as refuse, garbage, settlements,
villages, sites, artifacts,'' says Gary Ellis, senior archaeologist
for the state of Indiana.
   ``There just isn't any. Most of it is rumor.''
   More likely, Indian scholars say, the stone fort was built by
native American Indians.
   ``A lot of people don't like to believe the Indians could have
stacked rocks that size, but there's evidence around the country
they did things like that,'' says Donna Calhoun of rural Scottsburg,
who is writing a history of Indians in southern Indiana.
   Ray White, tribal chairman of the Miami Indian nation, suggested
the coins, lamps, armor and other artifacts could easily have
traveled inland via the Indian trading network. A diary Calhoun
uncovered during her research locates an Indian trading post 1{
miles east of Charlestown.
   Yet Olson says the evidence supporting the legend is overwhelming.
   ``What something like this does is alter the apple cart of
history,'' Olson says. ``Anytime you get all this and put it before
all these people who've got degrees in anthropology, it really turns
the table. They don't know how to combat it, so they say, `No, this
is a myth.'''
   An archaeological overview done in 1984 predicted the research
value of Devil's Backbone could be quite high. Under federal law,
any Indian mounds and artifacts must be protected from development
there.
   They could provide a unique look into southern Indiana's early
beginnings.
   Or, they could lend credence to a legend and shatter accepted
theories on the discovery and exploration of America.
   ``We need somebody to go into Charlestown and just do a survey,''
White says. ``They really need to find out what's there.
   ``It's bound to tell something about the early, early Indiana
history, before what they're teaching in the schools. It's very
important.''

   The Roman Catholic Church, fighting on the one
hand to encourage legislation against abortion, is beginning to
offer a consoling hand to those Catholic women who have had
abortions. Project Rachel is that beginning.

   The 24-year-old woman with a substance
abuse problem came to Stephen Lynott for help.
   She was pregnant, alone and angry after being abandoned by her
boyfriend and thrown out of her parents' home, recalls Lynott,
director of Catholic Social Services for the Marquette Diocese.
   While counseling the woman, Lynott found out she had ended two
earlier pregnancies. Part of her substance abuse problem came from
her effort to erase the painful memory of the abortions.
   Because of her abortions, Lynott says the woman expected
condemnation from the Roman Catholic Church. Instead, she was
surprised to find compassion.
   It might have been condemnation before 1985, when the diocese
began a program to teach counselors and priests how to help women
who have had abortions.
   Named for a biblical story about a woman who grieved inconsolably
for her children, Project Rachel treats women more like mourners
than sinners.
   Before that, an average of one or two Catholic women a month who
defied church opposition to abortion came to Lynott's agency for
help. Counselors, unaware of the women's abortions, sometimes were
unable to spot what was troubling them.
   ``We didn't know how to begin,'' Lynott says. ``It was an utterly
foreign concept.''
   Vickie Thorn, the founder of the first Project Rachel, which
began in the Archdiocese of Milwaukee in 1984, says feelings of
remorse aren't confined to Catholic women.
   ``I don't think it's Catholic guilt,'' she says. ``I think it's
just generic human guilt.''
   The National Conference of Catholic Bishops endorsed the concept
of post-abortion reconciliation services such as Project Rachel in
1985, according to the Rev. John Gouldrick, director of the bishops'
Pro-Life Office.
   At least 60 Catholic dioceses in the United States have started
Project Rachel programs because of estimates that as many as 30
percent of Catholic women have had abortions, Mrs. Thorn says. It's
about the same proportion as the general population, she added.
   Howard Hoeflein, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Detroit, says
the numbers aren't surprising, despite the church's position that
abortion except to save the life of the mother is a serious sin.
   ``Usually, when a decision on abortion is made, it is within a
framework of a lot of pressures being exerted on the woman,''
Hoeflein says. ``The church is just one element. It may be a
situation that is overwhelming.
   ``What we're trying to do is make sure because of one bad
decision, they don't just throw away the stabilizing influence of
the church on the rest of their lives.''
   Lynott says, ``We had one woman who came in the day after her
abortion. It was a very, very tough situation. Another woman waited
20 years. You're dealing with awareness and you're dealing with
denial. What triggers that, what opens that door, you can't really
predict.
   ``Some want to talk about their experience and that's a very
gut-wrenching experience. Some are right up front. They know where
their pain is. The younger clients, you may have to dig a little bit
more.''
   Pro-choice organizations say they doubt many women are modern-day
Rachels who regret ending their pregnancies.
   ``The guilt they feel is guilt society imposes on them, and the
Catholic Church are masters at imposing guilt on women,'' says Kate
Michelman, executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action
League.
   ``To try and cause women to feel guilt when they have already had
to struggle with such a difficult situation is in fact
anti-Christian.''
   Raised as a Catholic but no longer an active member of the
church, Michelman had an abortion after bearing three children.
   ``What I ended up feeling guilty about was not feeling guilty,''
she says. ``I made one of the most moral decisions I ever made in my
life.''
   A study published in 1974 indicated that up to 91 percent of
women report a sense of relief following abortion, while a 1976
study indicated that up to 98 percent had no regrets and would make
the same choice again, she says.
   Project Rachel counselors say that husbands, boyfriends and
grandparents, feeling anger or guilt over a family member's
abortion, also call, as do non-Catholics.
   Mrs. Thorn says eating disorders, substance abuse and inability
to mother children later are often linked to an earlier abortion.
But Michelman says the U.S. Surgeon General found no evidence that
women suffer psychological or emotional problems after abortion.
   While some seek professional counseling through the program,
others ask to talk to a sympathetic priest to seek forgiveness, Mrs.
Thorn says. ``They want to get straight with God.''
   Mrs. Thorn says priests routinely heard confessions of such women
but before Project Rachel's training were unprepared to help deal
with grief, guilt and the need to forgive themselves.
   ``It flies in the face of what is expected of the Catholic
Church,'' she says. ``Everybody assumes all we have done is say this
is terrible, terrible, terrible and done nothing else.''
   Steve Rall, parish social ministry director for the Lansing
Diocese, says he was impressed by a recent Project Rachel conference.
   ``It was the first time I had met with a group of pro-life people
where they were not angry and bitter,'' he says. ``This was a chance
for the pro-life side to do something.
   ``We see the right-to-life people pointing fingers and accusing
people of being murderers. To me, that's not Christian. There needs
to be forgiveness.''

   No matter they might drive to their rendezvous in
a high-powered, high-priced car. No matter they may spend thousands
on their guns, knives and tents. When they meet, they exchange
ritual handshakes and hugs, and for the next few days they relive
the life of mountain men.

   They have a heavy-duty look, muskets slung
over their shoulders, a full growth of beard, knives in their belts,
a competitive glint in the eye. Their wives sew.
   They call themselves mountain men, the likes of Jim Bridger, Joe
Meeks, William Sublette, Jim Beckwourth, men who wrestled grizzlies,
lived Indian-style before their mountains came under the protection
of the Stars and Stripes and the U.S. Cavalry.
   They're out there now, shades of the early 1800s, every weekend,
thousands of them, a reborn subculture that one expert says may
rival the rodeo in popularity.
   They meet in something called a rendezvous, an encampment, a
transient community of tepees, lodges and tents, although why it is
called by a French term is somewhat murky.
   Patrick McCarthy, an assistant professsor of film and television
at the University of Northern Colorado here, estimates as many as
250,000 people have attended rendezvous across the United States,
dressing up as trappers, traders and their female companions.
   One million to 3 million people, he estimates, have visited
rendezvous as guests. Their popularity has blossomed coast-to-coast,
with as many as 30 rendezvous a year held in Colorado alone.
   ``Every indication I have is that the mountain man subculture is
growing,'' McCarthy says. ``It hasn't reached its peak yet.''
   Maybe it's the appeal of the wilderness and the simplicity of the
lifestyle, or maybe it's a subconscious yearning for the days when
men were men and got away with it. Whatever it is, there they are,
facing off with nature in the 20th century, clad in animal skins or
other 19th century-style clothing made of wool, cotton or linen.
   The rendezvous is often an outdoor bazaar where fire-starting
kits, knives, guns and clothing can be bought or bartered for.
Blacksmiths, working at crude forges, craft blades, candlestick
holders and cookware.
   And there is a competitive edge, with shootouts, knife and
tomahawk-throwing contests, and day's end around the ceremonial
campfire for a group meal.
   There is a ritualistic greeting, usually a double handshake which
is an ordinary handshake followed by a thumbshake, and that is
usually followed by a hug, called a squoze. Which is then followed
by the question, ``Did you winter well?''
   Rendezvous originally were held in the West for trappers to
replenish supplies, enjoy whiskey hauled from the East and send
their year's supply of pelts back to civilization, where beaver was
in great demand for gentlemen's top hats.
   McCarthy, whose dark shoulder-length hair and heavy beard show
hints of gray, says he moved here a year ago because ``Colorado
geographically is the center of the mountain man subculture. I'm
here primarily because of my research interest.''
   McCarthy's doctoral dissertation concerned the mountain man
subculture and he has published several articles on the subject.
This summer he is teaching a journalism workshop called ``Mountain
Man Subculture.''
   McCarthy says the 19th-century mountain man ``was a mercantile
capitalist who lived a scavenger lifestyle. His halcyon years were
from 1825 to 1840. That was when the mountain man was at his peak
activity.''
   He lived off a raw, undeveloped, hostile West sparsely populated
by nomadic Indians. His tools were traps, knives and rifles. His
rugged lifestyle became the subject of 40 or more movies.
   The reborn mountain man subculture began flourishing in the
1970s, some of the interest sparked by the nation's bicentennial,
McCarthy says.
   It is ``a weapons-minded subculture.'' There are displays of guns
and knives. ``Competition is built around the weapons. Shooting a
gun is an act of dominance,'' he says.
   A modern mountain man may invest $1,000 or more in his weaponry,
clothing and rendezvous living quarters.
   McCarthy attends rendezvous as an interested but detached
observer. When necessary he interviews some of the mountain men.
   One of his first questions is, ```Why are you here?'
   ``Almost invariably,'' he says, ``the answer is, `Camaraderie.' ''
   The escapist weekend activities may be fueled as the 21st century
approaches.
   ``One way to put off the future is to retreat to the past,''
McCarthy says. ``Maybe it's a regressive activity. We're not ready
to step into the 21st century.
   ``What does the mountain man represent? Democratic ideals of
individuality and freedom. No one was more free and
individualistic,'' McCarthy says.
   Ron Melchert, a retired Army officer who operates a gunsmith shop
in Penrose, Colo., is a modern-day mountain man who is known at the
rendezvous as ``Blind Squirrel.''
   He started as a shooting competitor.
   ``I like it (dressing up and organized shoots) because it is
family-oriented,'' Melchert said. ``The kids are included.''
   ``People come for different reasons,'' McCarthy says. ``They may
come to shoot, trade or just picnic on a Saturday afternoon.
   ``Some are more serious mountain men. They feel they are the most
authentic.''
   Rendezvous vary in size from the 30,000 people who meet annually
at Fort Bridger, Wyo., to gatherings of only a few.
   Two other large events are the Green River Rendezvous in
Pinedale, Wyo., and the Rocky Mountain Men Rendezvous in Jefferson,
Colo.
   They are organized by a wide range of groups and individuals,
ranging from the National Muzzle-Loading Rifle Association to
ranchers.
   The outings produce some incongruities, for instance the Lincoln
Continental parked next to a tepee at Lost Park, Colo.
   But, for the most part, the mountain men insulate themselves from
the outside world. As one told his wife when she said she was going
into town to buy a newspaper, ``I don't need no newspaper, I'm at
the rendezvous.''

   After being fired on her last outing, Joan
Rivers was wary when she was offered a chance to be host of a new
television talk show.
   She got over it.
   Her new venture, ``The Joan Rivers Show,'' premieres Tuesday as
an afternoon TV magazine with a heavy emphasis on gossip.
   The comedian was fired in 1987 from ``The Late Show,'' the
inaugural series on Fox Broadcasting, after an eight-month feud over
low ratings.
   ``I was so burned on my previous show, I was so leery of things,
that I called Geraldo Rivera,'' says Rivers, whose new show and
``Geraldo'' are both produced by Tribune Entertainment Co.
   ``I said, `Tell me the truth. Are they gentlemen? Are they
honorable? Do they stand behind their word? Otherwise, I don't need
this again.' He came over to my apartment in New York and we talked
for an hour. He said, `Go with them.'''
   Rivers calls her new show an alternative to ``Geraldo,''
``Oprah'' and ``Donahue.''
   ``I don't want to do those shows,'' she says. ``You can only
watch so much about cross-dressing. My show's going to be
entertaining. We'll have personalities and gossip. We'll have some
issues. We'll get into the pros and cons of abortion. Mainly, it
will be a magazine with four segments. But no recipes. Hey, look at
these hands.
   ``I'm going to do the book reviews I couldn't do at night. I'm
going to bring out the cystic fibrosis parents I couldn't have on
before. It's going to be what interests me.
   ``Sure, I'm going to ask outrageous questions. Sometimes you get
some unexpected answers. I'm not creating any new art form, nor do I
see why I need to. Pat Sajak and Oprah Winfrey didn't have to create
a new format.''
   Rivers was the permanent substitute host for NBC's ``Tonight
Show'' when she quit in 1986 to challenge her mentor, Johnny Carson,
with a new late-night show that was the first offering of Fox's new
``fourth network.'' Carson protested bitterly that he learned of her
departure on the day her Fox show was announced.
   ``The Late Show'' made a highly publicized debut Oct. 9, 1986,
and after some initial curiosity from viewers quickly sank into the
ratings oblivion that has been the fate of most Carson competitors.
   Rivers left the show after the May 15, 1987, telecast and was
replaced by a series of rotating hosts. The final host of ``The Late
Show'' was Arsenio Hall, who later created his own syndicated late
night show that is now seen on 160 stations nationwide.
   Rivers says Fox promised advertisers and its affiliate stations a
6.2 rating for ``The Late Show,'' which was unrealistic. The show
actually delivered numbers that were only about half of that.
   ``They pulled the number out of the air,'' she says. ``They had
nothing else on the air. The star was held accountable and it was
all founded on quicksand.''
   ``Going over past ground at this point is fruitless,'' says Brad
Turell, senior vice president for Fox Broadcasting Co. ``We wish her
the best of luck. She's very talented and we think she'll do very
well with her new show.''
   Rivers' husband, Edgar Rosenberg, took his own life with a drug
overdose in August 1987. She says she feels problems with the Fox
show and his ill health contributed to his death.
   ``The Carson thing is behind me,'' Rivers says. ``The Fox thing
is behind me. The tragedy is the death of my husband. The rest is
all nonsense. I met Edgar through Carson. It's almost like a chapter
closed with Edgar's death,''
   The new one-hour show, originating in New York, will be sent
daily by satellite to 130 stations.
   Rivers, who has lived in Los Angeles for 18 years, has moved to
New York.
   ``I'm keeping my place in California. We were here for 18 years.
I said with Edgar's death I was going back home. Then you realize
you have major ties that you don't want to break.
   ``Edgar was the brains before. It's been an interesting two
years. I'm doing things now that I thought I'd never do. I have to
read the contracts now. There's no one to bounce things off of.''

   There's a big difference, say Douglas Bernstein
and Denis Markell, between writing for a small stage and the small
screen.
   ``On television, you write a joke, then someone else decides if
it's funny or not,'' says Markell, the bearded, bespectacled member
of an up-and-coming writing team that at one time turned out TV
scripts for the likes of Ricky Schroeder on ``Silver Spoons'' and
for a short-lived fairy tale sitcom called ``The Charmings.''
   ``Everything goes up a level to that someone else and gets
rewritten, then up another level and rewritten and up a third level
and rewritten,'' Bernstein adds. ``Consequently, when you put names
of your own friends in the script, by the time it gets on the air,
the names are the friends of the producer.
   ``In our revue `Showing Off,' we've got all our friends' names in
it and nobody can change them,'' he says with a laugh.
   With their own show, Bernstein and Markell are helping to
resuscitate a neglected theatrical art form _ the topical musical
comedy revue. At one time, New York embraced those bright, witty
little shows, productions such as Ben Bagley's ``Shoestring Revue''
and his salute to Cole Porter or Julius Monk's entertainments at the
Plaza and Upstairs at the Downstairs.
   ``The revue puts such a premium on the words and the wit and
that's something that tends to get lost on Broadway today,'' says
Bernstein, who also is one of the show's four performers. ``The
revue asks an audience to sit down and pay attention. If you blink
or turn away, you sometimes miss the whole premise of a song.''
   ``Showing Off,'' currently running in a small Upper West Side
nightspot called Steve McGraw's, pokes fun at a variety of current
topics, although don't look for jokes about such easy targets as
Donald Trump, Dan Quayle or Leona Helmsley.
   Among its more unusual subjects are show-biz rabbis, video rental
addiction, New York's 72nd Street, a man who has a crush on a local
television anchorwoman and what Bernstein and Markell call
``S.I.P.,'' those self-important people like maitre d's, telephone
receptionists and box office personnel who enjoy their moments of
control over everybody else.
   ``We don't take the audience for granted,'' Markell says. ``We
assume that they come to the show with a certain amount of
intelligence, and we don't insult them. Rather than making an
audience scared, it makes them feel like they are contributing to
the show.''
   The collaboration between Markell and Bernstein is unusual. Both
men write music and lyrics. They don't divide the tasks so there is
a lot of trading back and forth of ideas.
   ``Music is a lot harder to write together,'' Bernstein says.
``And after it's done, you don't know who did what.''
   Who decides what the final version will be?
   ``In `Showing Off,' we have a wonderful director, Michael
Leeds,'' Bernstein says. ``The director, for us, has always served
as the ultimate referee.''
   Although only in their early 30s, both men were steeped in the
traditions of musical comedy.
   ``Denis and I were both lucky enough to be brought up by parents
who valued and respected the revue form,'' Bernstein recalls. His
father wrote for hotel revues in the 1950s. Markell's father was a
television producer as well as a set designer in the early days of
New York television.
   ``We listened to recordings of revues and were always told: `Look
who wrote these songs. This is where Sheldon Harnick and Jerry Bock
wrote their songs. This is where Harvey Schmidt and Tom Jones wrote
their songs. And look what they went on to do,''' Bernstein adds.
``We've always viewed the musical revue as a not very distant source
for a lot of the great musical writers.''
   Bernstein and Markell met some 15 years ago at a music camp in
Raymond, Maine, where they would write ditties like ``The Bassoon
Teacher's Birthday.'' The two would sit on the main porch at the
camp's lodge and talk about current films such as ``Blazing
Saddles'' or favorite comics such as Woody Allen and Robert Klein
and make fun of the other kids at camp.
   Both writers attended Amherst College in Massachusetts where they
created a series of satirical revues. Among their performers was
Prince Albert of Monaco. ``He played a frog who turned into a
prince,'' Bernstein says.
   They came to New York in the fall of 1980. Markell ended up at
the BMI Workshop, a training ground for aspiring musical theater
writers guided at that time by the legendary conductor Lehman Engel
and later by such theater people as Maury Yeston, Ed Kleban and Alan
Mencken.
   A year later, the two were working for director Martin Charnin of
``Annie'' fame. He was looking for young, unknown writers to
contribute material to a revue, ``Upstairs at O'Neal's.''
   They wrote two of its brightest numbers _ ``Something,'' a parody
of a song called ``Nothing'' from ``A Chorus Line,'' and ``Momma's
Turn,'' a number supposedly sung by the mothers of New York drama
critics.
   A chance to work in television and films lured them to California
in 1986.
   ``We were lucky because an agent had seen a sample script of
ours,'' Markell says, ``and told us, `Come out to California.'''
   For eight months, they learned the discipline of television
writing, working on a schedule and reacting quickly to change.
   But their hearts belonged in New York and they returned. An early
draft of ``Showing Off'' was done in early 1987 and evolved into the
current production two years later. Now they are writing the book
and lyrics for a HBO project that will have music by Marvin
Hamlisch. But ``Showing Off'' is still on their minds. There may be
Los Angeles and Chicago editions of the show with new material
tailored to those two cities.
   ``We are determined to make the show feel specific so that the
audience would feel that they were at a special place,'' Bernstein
says. ``But at the same time we try to tackle issues and themes like
the man who has the crush on the TV anchorwoman, which are really
broader. So it's not really limited to New York.''

   Germans hold the edge in such
things as fast cars, beer and sauerbraten, and now they're claiming
the edge in fashions.
   German fashions? No. 1 in Europe? Ahead of the French and the
Italians?
   ``German fashion has the same reputation as German food _ it's
actually good, but everyone thinks of it as bland and fattening,''
Herwig Zahm, head of Mondi apparel near Munich, remarked at a recent
fashion fair in Duesseldorf, a new European fashion mecca in the
heart of West Germany's industrial heartland.
   No one questions that the West Germans have become leading
exporters of women's wear, but the French and Italians have
something to say about the Germans becoming No. 1 in Europe: maybe
they turn out clothes, but do they design and create?
   For years style-conscious buyers associated continental chic with
the established couturiers of Paris and Milan, where famed fashion
houses like Chanel and Armani turn out their twice yearly
collections to the accolades of the rich and famous.
   Now, with an expanding world market of well-paid professional
women and globe-trotting tourists, West German designers say they
are upstaging their foreign rivals with the right mix of panache and
pragmatism.
   Duesseldorf's showings may not draw Princess Caroline of Monaco
or the actress Catherine Deneuve, but royals and other
discriminating clientele have applauded West German fashions with
their pocketbooks, if not their presence.
   The German designers also point to the sharp rise in interest
among foreign buyers for German-made clothing, shoes, cosmetics and
jewelry aimed at the upper-middle income brackets.
   ``Our exports are very high and increasing each year, which shows
that our reputation is growing,'' said Claudia Timm, spokeswoman for
Duesseldorf's sprawling Igedo fashion market that has given focus to
design centers scattered throughout West Germany.
   Nearly a third of the $13 billion in West German apparel
manufactured last year was exported, and the foreign sales account
for an even larger share of output this year, according to the
Cologne-based Women's Outerwear Association.
   Salamander Shoes of Kornwestheim is Europe's largest producer of
footwear, and Klaus Steilmann's motto, ``Fashion for Millions, Not
Millionaires,'' has made him the continental king of contemporary
sportswear with nearly $640 million in annual sales.
   The West Germans contend it is their attention to quality and
marketing that has won them the No. 1 rank in performance in Europe,
if not in repute.
   ``The French have all the image, but they don't have a product
anymore,'' said Wolfgang Ley, president of Munich-based Escada firm
that expects to sell $400 million in exclusive apparel this year.
   ``The designers create a couture line, but the managers leave it
to any manufacturer to produce a ready-to-wear line,'' he added.
``Some of what is being produced under very famous labels is
absolute junk.''
   Ley's company, for which his Swedish-born wife, Margaretha, is
chief designer, posted a phenomenal 40 percent sales increase in
1988 and has seen an even brisker sales pace so far this year.
   ``We design our own fabrics and our own color stories,'' Ley
said. ``We make our own market and give it a direction. We don't
wait around to see how the wind is blowing.''
   In France, Jacques Mouclier, president of the French Federation
of Couturiers, said Ley is right in saying French-designed clothes
are made in other countries, but he maintained Paris remains No. 1
in fashion.
   ``France long ago won the battle in terms of creation, design,''
he said. ``We have the designers, the reputation around the world.
The best proof of that is the number of people who come to our shows
every season. Why, the number of accredited journalists comes to
2,000. ... We not only have French designers showing their creations
but also Japanese, Italian and American, because the capital of
fashion is Paris. And it will remain so, for Paris is open and
generous to the creative spirit.''
   The major Italian fashion houses in Milan were closed for
vacation and officials could not be reached for comment.
   But Italian fashion experts have maintained in the past that
while the West Germans have made inroads in the more economically
priced women's clothes, their fashion is less stylized than Italian
ready-to-wear and high fashion garments.
   The West Germans use names like Escada, Mondi and Tuzzi, which
conjure a Mediterranean image, and that is part of the strategy of
those designing for an international customer.
   Zahm and Ley said they chose easily uttered names with a
international ring to add flair to their image.
   Mondi sells $213 million in clothing each year and counts among
its customers the Princess Diana, wife of Britain's Prince Charles.
She caused a run on the firm's designer socks in 1985 after wearing
them to a polo match, and still places regular orders with Mondi
each season. For this fall she ordered a wardrobe of burgundy, black
and vanilla.
   Jil Sander of Hamburg has captured another impressive corner of
the up-market with classic styles, subtle colors and natural fabrics
that pack well and wear long enough to justify their high-end price
tags.
   ``You can start with a few pieces and build up a basic wardrobe
over the years,'' said Miss Sander, a slender 45-year-old who still
models for some of her advertisements. ``That's much less costly
than getting a lot of clothes and having no style.''
   Her clothes are produced in West Germany and shown exclusively at
the fall and spring fashion fairs in Milan.
   Many West German firms have begun farming out some of their
production to Eastern Europe and other countries where wages are
lower.
   Women's Outerwear Associated reported a 22 percent increase in
out-of-country preparations last year, although the share accounts
for only about 5 percent of total production.
   Designers of exclusive sportswear, like Miss Sander and Ley,
contend production costs concern them less than maintaining quality,
and they plan to continue overseeing their operations close to home.
   But for the broader field of clothing producers competing for the
middle-income market, contracting out to Eastern Europe or
Mediterranean countries is likely to become an attractive means of
cutting costs.
   Another West German success story is Karl Lagerfeld, who
continues to boost his countrymen's image, although he has switched
to the Paris house of Chanel.
   Lagerfeld still markets the KL line from West Germany and retains
a showroom and boutique at the Igedo market.
   Part of the attraction for West German designers to the more
renowned fashion capitals is likely the glitz and glamor that
Duesseldorf lacks, despite its better balance sheet.
   ``Those things probably matter _ that French designers show up
with their Beautiful People,'' Ley noted. ``But the Princess of
Wales sneaks into our boutique in London at least twice a season.
They don't go to the shows, but we have the princes and queens of
Europe buying Escada.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Natalie Cole Sings and Says ``I Do''</HEAD>

   Singer Natalie Cole's ``I Do'' is climbing the
rhythm 'n' blues charts.
   And on Sept. 17 she'll say ``I do'' to record producer Andre
Fischer in a wedding ceremony in Los Angeles.
   ``I've got my gown. I never had a wedding gown before. I didn't
have a traditional wedding the first time.''
   Fischer was the original drummer and founder of the R&amp;B group
Rufus with Chaka Khan. He and Cole met about 15 years ago at a Tokyo
music festival.
   ``Chaka and I became friends,'' she said. ``I had no idea he
(Fischer) liked me.
   ``Last October I received a call from one of my background
singers that Andre had some material he wanted to submit. I later
found out what he really wanted was a date. He was very cool and a
little shy. I figured it was going to be a business relationship,
and it was for several months.
   ``We did work on the `Good to Be Back' album. He arranged and
produced `Matter of Fact' and `Gonna Make You Mine.'
   ``In January I was performing in Lake Tahoe and he called. Would
it be OK if he came to see the show, and he wanted to bring his
children. He has three. I said, `sure.'
   ``He told me he'd been in love with me 15 years,'' Cole said.
   Fischer proposed after her 39th birthday in February.
   Cole has been on a 40-city tour since July, promoting her new
``Good to Be Back'' album of mid-tempo ballads on EMI Records. In a
recent relaxed, happy interview, she said it's her first such tour
in at least seven years.
   The song ``I Do'' is a duet with Freddie Jackson. ``It is a
getting-married song. Freddie told me his sister is getting married
and wants to play it at her wedding. It is definitely a love
ballad.''
   On her tour, Cole's cousin, Eddie, sings it with her. Her father,
Nat ``King'' Cole, had three brothers, Ike, Freddie and the late
Eddie Sr. All were singers.
   Cole's first husband was Marvin Yancey, co-producer of her first
album, ``Inseparable,'' which won her Grammy awards in 1976 as best
new artist and best rhythm 'n' blues female vocal performance for
her single ``This Will Be.'' They divorced nine years ago. He died
of a heart attack three years ago.
   The ``Good to Be Back'' album isn't a comeback album. It refers
to Cole's 1987 ``Everlasting'' album, her first for EMI, which was a
comeback and was a success. The biggest single from it was ``Pink
Cadillac.''
   ``I think rock fans were a little upset,'' she said. That's by
their buddy, Bruce (Springsteen). How could I do a song he wrote? He
must have hated it because I never heard a word.''
   Her album, ``Dangerous,'' on Modern Records in 1985 was her first
since going through drug rehabilitation six years ago. ``That album
was OK. It wasn't a big deal but it was better than some things I
had done. That was a very difficult time for me.''
   Even though she knows how bad addiction can be, Cole doesn't give
advice about drugs. ``You can advise all day long and it doesn't
mean anything. I was advised. Kids are going to do what they're
going to do.''
   But she does have advice for parents. ``You try to show them the
road. If kids are brought up with a lot of animosity, friction and
noncommunication, where everybody walks around holding everything
inside, you're going to get in trouble,'' she said. ``We need to
keep the line of communication open with young people. My biggest
concern as a parent is that my son will be able to talk to me.
   ``Kids in the era I was brought up in weren't allowed to talk
about certain things. It wasn't right to have certain thoughts going
on in your head. You'd feel guilty if you brought them up to your
mom or your dad. I found my answers outside of the home, which isn't
the greatest place to experiment.''
   About her son, 11-year-old Robbie, she says, ``I want him to have
an education. I'm glad I got my education. In spite of all the
things I've been through, the bottom line is I know I'm educated,
intelligent. I can speak well, express myself. I can mingle; I don't
have to feel ostracized in any kind of group.
   ``With education my children might even be able to stand out,''
she said. ``Their education will be such that they can move around
and see the world. I had that opportunity and I would want the same
thing for them.
   ``We should upgrade our education system and put more money into
it. These days you want to send your kid to private school if you
can afford it. It shouldn't be like that.''

   Marty Raybon, lead vocalist for the
rising country music band Shenandoah, offers this description of the
group's promising career:
   ``We're hanging in there like a hair in a biscuit.''
   The five-member vocal band has had two straight No. 1 hit records
on the country charts: ``Sunday in the South'' in August and
``Church on Cumberland Road'' in April.
   By the end of the year, the group's album, ``The Road Not
Taken,'' may yield six hit singles. After just two years of
recording with a major label, Shenandoah has become one of the most
successful new bands in a crowded country field.
   ``I'd say our progress has been wonderful,'' Raybon said. ``We're
slap tickled to death.''
   The group, from Muscle Shoals, Ala., has been playing together
four years. They were a house band at a nightclub in Muscle Shoals
when they signed with Columbia Records.
   ``Church on Cumberland Road'' was a spirited up-tempo song while
``Sunday in the South'' was a graphic recounting of Dixie culture.
Among their other hit records, ``Mama Knows'' focused on parental
wisdom and ``She Doesn't Cry Anymore'' was tions, Sept 1-3

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Psychopathic Pediatric Nurse</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE COCHRAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associted Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AUSTIN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peter Elkind's new book, ``The Death
Shift,'' is precisely what it purports to be: a true and troubling
account of every parent's worst nightmare. And more.
   What could be worse than a psychopathic nurse entrusted with the
lives of children too young to know or tell that someone is secretly
trying to kill them?
   The answer: Only a medical community too timid or too callous to
expose the killer for fear of scandal or lawsuits.
   Elkind tells the story of licensed vocational nurse Genene Jones
and her reign of medical terror, first at the pediatric intensive
care unit of San Antonio's premier public hospital, and later at a
small private clinic in nearby Kerrville.
   Although convicted of killing only one child and injuring
another, nurse Jones apparently played a deadly role in the illness
and deaths of a number of other children. And while associates and
administrators suspected the worst _ or at least should have _ they
did little or nothing to stop her.
   ```The Death Shift' will make the hair on the back of your neck
stand on end,'' says author Gary Cartwright, Elkind's colleague at
Texas Monthly magazine. ``(This) tale of a maniacally evil nurse and
the duplicity of the medical community is a master stroke of
investigative journalism and a literary accomplishment. This is
Pulitzer material.''
   Elkind, an associate editor, weaves a story that at once
horrifies and infuriates.
   ``The Death Shift'' (Viking, $19.95) traces Jones' past from a
troubled, erratic childhood through a series of ill-fated romances
to her employment at Bexar County Hospital in 1978.
   Elkind uncovers awesome evidence of Jones' emotional instability
up to and beyond that point, but suggests that a feigned or
psychosomatic illness in March 1981 signaled the beginning of the
``nightmare.''
   What had emerged, he wrote, was a nurse with a strange attraction
to medicine who was unable to distinguish between true illness and
imagined calamity.
   That nurse was then set loose in a hospital to care for the most
helpless of human beings, where all the warning signs were ignored:
her firing from a previous hospital job, her history of lies, her
on-the-job errors, her inability to admit mistakes, her
unwillingness to follow orders, her exaggerated sense of her
abilities, her need to be in control and her desperate craving for
attention.
   ``For a while, Genene Jones would be satisfied to point out
medical problems that didn't exist,'' Elkind observed. ``It was only
a matter of time before that would no longer be enough.''
   The trouble began in mid-1981 with a series of inexplicable
emergencies in the pediatric intensive care unit at Bexar County
Hospital, now called Medical Center Hospital, a $17 million link in
the vast University of Texas medical system.
   Babies were suddenly dying and almost always on the 3-11 p.m.
shift, when Jones was on duty.
   As the crisis escalated, the hospital quietly conducted an
internal investigation and confronted the unimaginable prospect that
one of its nurses was actually killing infants.
   No one ever would know exactly how many babies died from lethal
injections administered by Jones, but an estimate much later would
run as high as 16, Elkind reports.
   ``Unable to admit that even to themselves, and fearful of bad
publicity and lawsuits, the hospital said nothing to the police or
the district attorney; it chose, instead, to remove Jones by
`upgrading' the ICU staff,'' he writes.
   But the nightmare did not end there.
   Armed, incredibly, with a good recommendation from the hospital,
Jones moved on to a private pediatricians' clinic in the nearby
Texas Hill Country. Overnight, the deadly pattern began again.
   In fact, Jones had accompanied a doctor named Kathy Holland from
the San Antonio hospital to Kerrville, where Holland opened an
office at a local clinic.
   Trial evidence would later indicate Jones was injecting the
Kerrville victims with succinycholine, a paralyzing drug believed by
many to be untraceable.
   But a medical expert in Sweden uncovered traces of the drug in
the body of a tiny victim named Chelsea McClellan, and it was her
death for which Jones was tried and convicted of murder in 1984.
Despite a 99-year prison sentence, and a subsequent 60 years
assessed in an injury-to-a-child case, she will be eligible under
Texas law for parole in 1990.
   ``In this tragedy of few heroes, many share blame with Genene
Jones,'' Elkind concludes. ``Among them is Kathy Holland, who has
never acknowledged that her failure transcended poor judgment and
naivete.
   ``But responsibility also rests with the doctors and
administrators in San Antonio who had known so much about the
troubled nurse before the clinic in Kerrville even opened. They were
the ones who had evidence she was harming children. They were the
ones who tolerated her blackmail. They were the ones who refused to
fire her for fear of litigation and scandal. ... Those people should
have known better.
   ``Unlike Genene Ann Jones, they lacked the excuse of madness.''

   ``5:01 Blues'' (Epic) _ Merle Haggard
   
   Country great Merle Haggard is batting .500 on ``5:01 Blues,'' an
album that succeeds with its more traditional material but falters
when the singer stretches out stylistically and ventures near
crossover land.
   When the album works, Haggard remains as vital as the younger
generation of country stars for whom he has been a major influence.
   The best songs are all on the first side of the album, which
opens with the rolling barroom piano of ``Broken Friend,'' a lament
about a relationship that falls apart when two friends become lovers.
   One could be forgiven for groaning at the title of ``Losin' in
Las Vegas.'' Who needs another song about hitting the skids in
Vegas, right? But this is a gem, with a world-weary Haggard singing
over a mournful guitar about a failed attempt to settle down (!?)
and make a home in Glittertown.
   The song ``5:01 Blues'' differs from the usual workingman's tale.
The guy in this song watches the clock, but he dreads quitting time
because he's got ``no one to go home to.''
   Haggard's rich voice and excellent backup musicians also shine on
the ballad ``Someday We'll Know'' and the mid-tempo ``Wouldn't That
Be Something.''
   The album takes a turn for the worse on the second side, an
aimless collection of songs redeemed by the bluesy ``A Thousand Lies
Ago.'' Haggard can do better than the lightweight boogie of ``If You
Want to Be My Woman'' and ``Sea of Heartbreak,'' an odd attempt to
incorporate a pseudo-reggae beat into his bag of tricks.
   Also, with only about half an album's worth of good material, it
seems appropriate to note the record's entire length is barely more
than 30 minutes.

   ``Diamond Mine'' (Atlantic) _ Blue Rodeo
   
   Knocking one band to praise another is usually a cheap way to do
business, but sometimes the comparisons are too good to resist.
   The virtually unknown band Blue Rodeo has perfected the languid
country-rock sound sought by ballyhooed Canadian cousins Cowboy
Junkies. But unlike the Junkies, Blue Rodeo's work is neither
affected nor boring.
   ``Diamond Mine'' is just as its title suggests, a record where
treasures are regularly unearthed.
   With nearly every song, there's the nagging sense that you've
heard it somewhere before but can't quite place it. And while there
are hints of Bruce Springsteen, the Band, Jackson Browne, Johnnie
Cash and dozens of others in the music, it's not strictly derivative.
   Common themes are dealt with succinctly and without cliche. The
Toronto-based band quickly undresses Oliver North on ``God and
Country.'' ``You call this justice,'' sing Jim Cuddy and Greg
Keelor. ``I call this self-service.''
   While ``Love and Understanding'' tackles the problems of war and
drug abuse with a hopelessly '60s approach _ ``Love and
understanding are the best answers I've heard yet'' _ it somehow
doesn't sound naive.
   Blue Rodeo mixes country twang and rock drive adroitly, with
Cuddy's relatively sweet voice offering a good counterpoint to
Keelor's sinister growl. The instrumentation is first-rate, with
inspired drumming by Cleave Anderson on ``Love and Understanding''
and duty on the piano, accordion and organ by Bob Wiseman.
   They mix brief instrumental interludes with titles such as
``Swells'' and ``Percussive Piano'' on the hour-long disc. The
approach gives a relaxed pace that accentuates the finer songs.
   The one miscalculation here is a whopper. The title cut's killer
hook rightfully makes it the centerpiece of the record, but a
meandering solo passage stretches the song to a grueling 8:18. Throw
out the Doors records from this group's collection!
   Even this mistake gives notice this is a band with a strong and
stubborn view of itself. Throughout ``Diamond Mine,'' this
self-confidence consistently rewards listeners.

   For Cheech Marin, the 1960s was an awakening.
   ``It was like I came out of my shell, and I found other people
were thinking like thoughts,'' he said. ``I became aware of my own
power to change events and people around me, no matter what a small
degree. I found the power of uniting with other people and effecting
change.''
   Marin and his partner, Tommy Chong, became symbols of those
turbulent years, the poets laureate of pot culture. Their first
album, ``Cheech and Chong,'' went gold; the second, ``Big Bambu,''
was voted top comedy album of 1972; the third, ``Los Cochinos,'' won
the Grammy. Much of the comedy was centered on getting stoned.
   The theme continued with their first movie, ``Up in Smoke,''
which was the top-grossing comedy of 1978. Cheech and Chong made
five more films and cameo appearances in ``Yellowbeard'' and ``After
Hours'' before splitting as a team four years ago.
   Marin is exploring the '60s once more in the Orion release,
``Rude Awakening,'' co-starring with Eric Roberts, Julie Hagerty and
Robert Carradine. Roberts and Marin play a couple of hippies who
return from 20 years of self-exile to find their former comrades
transformed into money-mad yuppies.
   Recalling his own transformation in the '60s, Marin reflected:
``I was kind of a straight college guy, belonged to a fraternity and
went to school every day. My dad was a cop, and I was straight down
the center. Then _ change picture!
   ``I discovered pottery and pot, and friends and ideas and other
bohemians and Topanga Canyon (a hippie hangout). So it was `goodbye,
see you later.' This was another life. I left the country and went
to Canada for three years, and I met Chong and came back and did
`Cheech and Chong.'
   ``I really feel sorry for kids who didn't experience (the '60s).
It was a great awakening, a great time of unity when everybody was
thinking the same thought.''
   Although the ``Cheech and Chong'' years made him rich, Marin
denies he has embraced the Establishment, like his old buddies in
``Rude Awakening.''
   ``I always consider myself an outsider as much as I'm a part of
Hollywood,'' he said. ``I don't really hang out in Hollywood too
much. I don't go to parties or hobnob with producers. I live way out
at the end of Malibu, almost to Oxnard.''
   Some of his old compatriots have turned yuppie, he observed, but
others have remained ``dyed-in-the-wool,
live-in-the-woods-in-a-tepee-with-no-electricity hippies who have
the same ideals.
   ``The people I hang out with more or less cling to those ideals,
the same as I do,'' he said.
   He admitted that today's younger generation does not have the
unifying factor of the Vietnam War. ``It was a real and present
danger that you were going to get drafted and shipped over there.''
   Saving the Amazon rain forest is not quite the same, but Marin is
pleased that young Americans are beginning to embrace such issues.
   After the friendly breakup with Chong, Marin sought new avenues
of endeavor. He wrote, directed and starred in ``Born in East
L.A.,'' which was a modest success last year.
   Marin, who actually was born in central Los Angeles and grew up
in the San Fernando Valley, is writing a new script, ``Angel of
Oxnard,'' which he plans to shoot in the spring. It's all about his
present home grounds, which he calls ``a small town that might be in
Kansas, an agricultural community caught in the midst of change.''
   As one time prophets of the drug generation, Cheech and Chong
might seem antithetical in today's ``just say no'' atmosphere. But
Marin has no regrets.
   ``Not a bit, absolutely not. I loved what we were doing, I loved
the Cheech and Chong movies and the albums. They will probably
outlast anything I've ever done. They're rented all the time in
video; the albums still sell today. We've become part of people's
vocabulary. Kids today see the movies and buy the albums. They make
people laugh, and that's what counts.
   ``The `Just Say No' campaign comes out of where the scene had
gone,'' he said. ``There's a real whole world of difference between
a bunch of hippies sitting around the fire smoking a joint and
trying to find God, and 14-year-old Uzi-toting, beeper-carrying
crack dealers. They have nothing to do with our generation and are
totally devoid of the message we were saying.
   ``Drugs have definitely gotten out of hand, and I agree with the
`Just Say No' campaign. There is a great distinction between what
people do and what people did.''

<HEAD>The Artists: Segal Adds Color and Gets Religion</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KNOKKE, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   George Segal, whose life-size sculptures
turned him into a pop art icon in the 1960s, is molding his plaster
into other shapes.
   The 64-year-old American artist is adding color and religious
themes to his work and is even trying theater designs.
   In his first major European show of the decade, at a seafront
casino in this beach resort, Segal has included his trademark
plasters, but this time in either rusty or vivid tones to add
contrast. A series of pastel paintings is also on show, revealing a
new side the artist perfected in the 1980s.
   Biblical themes such as the Expulsion and Abraham's farewell to
Ishmael are on show alongside his ghostly plasters, which seem to
sleepwalk through modern society.
   The soft-spoken sculptor avoid questions about these changes.
``You have to follow your own logic,'' he said in an interview in
the garden of the Knokke casino owners.
   Segal made a stopover here to open his show following a
three-week stay in Moscow, where he designed his first theater set
for director Maximilian Schell.
   He said he never felt trapped by the plaster sculptures that shot
him to fame with such pop artists as Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg,
Jasper Johns and Roy Lichtenstein.
   ``When pop art first became noticed, I felt I was sitting on the
tail of a rocket,'' said Segal. ``Amazingly, it still flies.''
   And it is still spanning the globe.
   He said interest in Japan had increased in the 1980s to the
extent that he had to reduce his presence in Europe, where he made
his first international breakthrough at the Parisian gallery of
Ileana Sonnabend in 1963. In the '70s, the West Germany contemporary
art museums stocked their showrooms with his plasters.
   Now he is back on the Continent, even making a rare detour to the
Soviet Union. Schell lured him into a Moscow theater to create the
decor for ``Faith, Love, Hope,'' a 1936 play by Austrian Odon Von
Horvath, because the stage director thought ``the dark, gray, grim
mood of the sculptures was similar to the mood of the play,'' Segal
said.
   Returning to the Soviet Union for the first time in 15 years
brought equally bleak visions of Soviet society to life for Segal,
despite the spirit of glasnost. ``It is just as grim. There is less
food and more cars.''
   His return there also proves his appeal has remained
undiminished. ``I never expected to be so popular over such a large
part of the world,'' he said.
   Segal still uses his chicken farm in New Jersey as a studio and
he continues to work at a steady pace, not pressured by increasing
demands and prizes.
   ``I just refused to accelerate production,'' he said, explaining
that it could have changed his art.
   Segal was first a painter, pursuing the impressionistic style of
Matisse, before a nagging insecurity pushed him toward experimenting
with plaster and wire in the late '50s. He soon started making molds
of models and placed them in real settings.
   His work was lauded by other pop art greats.
   ``We all knew each other. We went in and out of each other's
studio. We all shared basic ideas,'' he said. ``We were in reaction
against pure abstraction and wanted to reintroduce the real world.''
   Instead of abstract expressionist drippings of Jackson Pollock,
pop art produced such pieces of ``reality'' as Warhol's Campbell's
soup cans, Lichtenstein's blown-up cartoons and Segal's sculptures.
   Segal has gone on from there, and his pieces now increasingly
resemble the academic works of 19th-century sculptors such as Rodin,
another master in creating theatrical composition.
   Segal's method, however, is anything but traditional.
   He puts pieces of cloth dipped in plaster on a live model and
waits until they harden on the body. The uneasiness of the situation
brings out the real emotions in the models he said, and gives his
work much of its authenticity.
   ``It's very hard to be a fake with that kind of wet discomfort
over such a long period of time.
   ``They suffer for my art,'' he said with a grin.

<TEXT>
   In 1956, a 72-year-old retired teacher pondered
the idea of forming an organization to help older people get health
insurance.
   Two years later, Ethel Percy Andrus and two compatriots met at
Washington's Woodner Hotel and voted to incorporate the American
Association of Retired Persons, by then envisioned as more than a
mere source of insurance.
   What evolved was a non-profit organization that has grown in 31
years to 30.6 million members _ surpassed in size in the United
States only by the Catholic Church.
   Its activities include a mail-order pharmacy service, educational
publications and classes, a senior volunteer network, local chapter
activities, circulation-leading Modern Maturity magazine, driver
education courses, legal assistance, a discount purchase program,
group health, home and auto insurance, a motor club, travel service,
investment programs, and even help filling out tax forms.
   And topping the list is AARP's role as the voice of the elderly
in Washington and at statehouses around the nation.
   ``AARP is not just the most important force in the `gray lobby,'
it is unquestionably the nation's largest and most powerful interest
group,'' authors Peter G. Peterson and Neil Howe wrote in the book,
``On Borrowed Time.''
   AARP executive director Horace Deets said the organization's
influence _ he shuns the word ``clout'' as suggesting power gained
by threat _ stems from ``the reasonableness of our positions and the
thoroughness of our research.''
   But he acknowledges: ``Having 30 million members certainly gets
someone's attention. That will open a door for me to talk to a
congressman or a senator or a governor.''
   AARP has no political action committee to funnel money to
candidates, and it refuses to take sides in partisan politics,
preferring to explain the issues to its members _ who are among the
most politically active citizens in the electorate _ and let them
vote and write letters accordingly, Deets said.
   Political analyst William Schneider of the American Enterprise
Institute said another reason AARP _ and the senior lobby overall _
is so powerful is that most Americans don't see older people as just
another special interest group.
   ``The elderly are not seen as a special interest because everyone
expects to get old,'' Schneider said. ``It's impossible to get
people of working age to oppose benefits for people of retirement
age.''
   That attitude may have been altered somewhat, at least on Capitol
Hill, in reaction to a firestorm of protest from older Americans
angry at their costs for new Medicare coverage of catastrophic
illnesses.
   ``There's real resentment in the Congress about how ... senior
citizens have responded,'' said Bruce Fried of the National Health
Care Campaign. ``I'm afraid that will have a fairly negative
impact'' on efforts to further expand benefits.
   AARP itself caught heat from senior citizens over the
catastrophic program because it was a key player in the legislative
negotiations and reluctantly acceded to financing it partly through
an income tax surcharge on some elderly beneficiaries.
   Deets said AARP tried unsuccessfully to change the financing of
the program, and eventually backed the legislation as ``on balance
deserving of support.''
   He said AARP has gotten more than 60,000 letters about the
catastrophic program, most of them complaints, but he insists the
controversy hasn't weakened the organization.
   ``I think it probably makes you vibrant,'' he said. ``Sometimes
disagreement can bring light and breathe life.''
   Fernando Torres-Gil, associate professor of gerontology and
public administration at the University of Southern California, said
AARP may have alienated some of its affluent members by backing the
catastrophic bill, but it ``mitigated one of the criticisms that
they've always faced, that they represent the articulate and
well-off elderly.''
   ``In the long run, they will be much stronger,'' he predicted.
   While AARP's influence on Capitol Hill is well known, some
observers say the massive size of the organization and its diverse
membership may limit its effectiveness.
   ``It's just too big ... it's unwieldly,'' said Harry R. Moody of
the Brookdale Center on Aging at Hunter College in New York. ``The
aging lobby has a lot of differences within itself. The image of the
gray lobby as an all-powerful force is a vast exaggeration.''
   Torres-Gil said that while the perception of senior citizens'
clout ``has increased dramatically over the years, the reality is
that their political influence is becoming fragmented.''
   Deets acknowledged that with AARP's diverse membership, ``to
speak with one voice becomes difficult,'' but he said there still is
broad consensus on many issues, such age discrimination, income
security and long-term care.
   Howe, a senior fellow at the Retirement Policy Institute, said
that because AARP's ranks include members ranging down to age 50, it
is experiencing an ``identity crisis'' that eventually will spread
throughout the senior lobby.
   ``It's going to happen to all of the elderly lobbies, but it's
happening to AARP first,'' he said. ``It's getting a new generation
of elderly, a very different generation of elderly.''

   Suburban Detroit was no place to retire, so Virginia and Tom
Powers packed up their belongings and moved.
   They didn't go to the Sun Belt.
   The Powers retired north, to Michigan's Upper Peninsula, a
flannel-shirted place even on July nights, famous for arduous
winters and mosquito-bit summers.
   ``Land of the Loon,'' the T-shirts say.
   The Powers could have flocked south like so much of America's
retiring public, but it was in these snowbirds' minds to head
instead toward Canada.
   ``I think Florida is pretty crowded and in my opinion, there are
not enough young people there,'' she said. ``All you do in Florida
is get behind some large car going 10 miles an hour.''
   Older Americans are a moving lot. The U.S. Bureau of the Census
calculates that last year, 5.3 percent of those over 65 changed
homes, one out of five of them settling in another state.
   From 1975 to 1980, more than 9 percent of those over 60 moved out
of their home cities while another 13.4 percent moved within their
towns, said Dr. Charles Longino, a University of Miami researcher
who spent six years studying the migration.
   Warmer, dryer weather and lifestyle amenities like year-round
golf continue to draw most retirees south and west, said Don Fowles,
a statistician for the U.S. Administration on Aging in Washington,
D.C. ``People are more sensitive to cold as they grow older.''
   A minority of the affluent elderly seek colder climates, as did
the Powers. Virginia, 67, and Tom, 68, found their haven on the tip
of the Garden Peninsula, a remote spit of land on the north shore of
Lake Michigan.
   There is only one paved road down the peninsula. The largest
town, Garden, has just a single grocery store and two bars. Most of
the residents are farmers, loggers or fishermen.
   ``After living in an area as congested as Detroit, you need the
space the North provides,'' Virginia said. ``I think most retirees
find it so blissful up here, with the clean air and the space.
   ``There's no fear, and it's such a relaxed feeling,'' she said.
``There's a friendlier attitude up here.''
   There also are economic reasons for flying north.
   The bottom dropped out of the Upper Peninsula's economy five
years ago. Homes entered the market at rock bottom prices as iron
ore mines closed and workers moved away to find jobs.
   The economy has picked up since then, but housing remains a
bargain. A decent three-bedroom home in the Upper Peninsula goes for
$30,000, and $100,000 will buy you a dream house on the shore, said
Escanaba real estate agent Jeanne Bonefeld. Her son in Florida tells
her the same homes sell for two to three times as much among the
orange groves.
   The ruggedness has its definite disadvantages. Tom broke his leg
recently when he was hit by a falling cedar tree. The closest
hospital was more than an hour away, although the local ambulance
arrived within 15 minutes.
   And when Tom needed arterial bypass surgery two years ago, the
Powers elected to use a hospital in Green Bay, Wis.
   Retirees living in the North Woods may find themselves isolated,
financially and geographically, from health care.
   A hearing in Houghton Lake held by Michigan's Office of Services
to the Aging in June turned up tales of 20-mile ambulance rides to
the nearest hospital costing from $400 to $1,000 each. ``We need to
determine if they're paying actual costs or if they're being
bilked,'' said Mary Lindemann, with the state agency in Lansing.
   And then there is the snow.
   Delta County gets an average 56 inches of snowfall a winter _
more on the Garden Peninsula since it is surrounded by water _ so
the Powers own a snowblower and clear their 1,100-foot driveway
themselves.
   Their road is too narrow for a commercial plow. The Powers could
widen it, but that would ruin the remote atmosphere, Virginia says.
   ``It takes the kind of person who likes the isolation. We enjoy
having the elbow room. We had lived cheek by jowl in town and we
were looking for someplace else,'' she said.
   The Powers have found a definite change of pace since their
working days _ he as a school administrator and she as a high school
English teacher _ outside of Detroit.
   ``Chickadees eat out of our hands. I identified 42 different
kinds of wild flowers in my yard. I press flowers and make bookmarks
and make pine cone wreaths and I knit chair cushions and send them
off to my friends. You have time,'' Virginia said.
   ``We never realized how beautiful a sunset was and we never
realized how far north the sun moves in the summer, how far south in
the winter.''

<TEXT>
   For more than a decade Paul Isaacson has
labored to save the souls of his dead ancestors, patiently searching
miles of microfilm and stacks of catalogs in the Mormon Church's
Family History Library.
   Mormon missionary work isn't limited to the living, and each day
thousands of the faithful flock to the library, the world's largest
repository of genealogical records, to fulfill the church's
determination to baptize every person who ever lived.
   ``There's something spiritual to it,'' said Isaacson, a Mormon
who often devotes his days off and evenings to genealogical
research. ``Also, it's your roots, your family. It's kind of like a
mystery, trying to track someone down. It's a puzzle to be solved.''
   But as the popularity of tracing one's roots has become more
popular, the Family History Library of The Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-day Saints has become a prime resource for non-Mormon
professional and amateur genealogists.
   Of the 3,000 people who use the library each day, about 40
percent are non-Mormon, said Tom Daniels, the library's director of
information. Often they come by the busload in tours organized by
genealogical societies from throughout the United States and Europe.
   The most recent survey of users, conducted in the winter of 1988,
indicated that senior citizens made up about 40 percent of the
library's users _ a figure consistent with other surveys of recent
years, Daniels said.
   Seniors also make up the majority of some 250 church volunteers
who supplement the library's 200 full-time staff members. Daniels
said the seniors are ``called,'' or asked by the church to work at
the library for a limited period of time.
   Use of the library is free, and those who come have access to
birth and death records of an estimated 1.5 billion to 2 billion
people, culled from the archives of about 100 nations.
   Business is sufficiently brisk that the church's genealogical
department, which operates the library, has outgrown a three-story
building constructed five years ago across the street from the Salt
Lake Temple in downtown Salt Lake City.
   Several of the department's divisions are housed in an office
building a block away, and the library will expand to occupy a
portion of the old Hotel Utah, which is being renovated to house a
chapel and administrative offices.
   Daniels said library usage has increased 60 percent since 1984 _
the greatest period of growth since the early 1970s, when Alex
Haley's book ``Roots'' turned thousands of people to genealogy as a
hobby.
   Daniels said he cannot explain the latest surge in genealogical
activity. The church always has encouraged its members to research
their ancestry and submit names of their forebears to temples, where
such ordinances as baptism are performed by living proxies.
   But in recent years more people have been taking advantage of the
archives, and that may have induced more church members to get
involved.
   ``Why the large number of non-Mormons are coming, I don't know.
Maybe it's just a natural increase in hobbyists,'' he said.
   Mormons believe that spirits of dead persons should have the
opportunity to accept Mormonism in afterlife. Members are encouraged
to have the faith's ordinances performed for all their ancestors in
the hope that they will embrace the faith.
   The doctrinal injunction for genealogical work is strong. The
church's founder, Joseph Smith, told his followers more than 100
years ago that, ``The greatest responsibility in this world that God
has lain upon us is to seek after our dead.''
   The church has taken Smith's charge seriously. About 200
photographers regularly are dispatched overseas to photograph
records of birth, death and census records in any country that will
permit it.
   Records have been copied extensively in Europe. More recently the
collection effort has shifted to Latin America and Asia.
   For eight years church photographers have been copying Chinese
records, including some lines that reach back more than 1,000 years.
   ``They're far superior, far more accurate, than European
records,'' Daniels said. ``In Oriental records, 65 generations (of
continuous record-keeping) are not uncommon. In Europe, you're lucky
to find 10.''
   To ensure nothing is lost, master copies of the microfilm are
kept in the church's Granite Mountain Records Vault, carved deep
into a mountainside about 20 miles southeast of Salt Lake City.
   Designed to withstand a nuclear explosion, the vault features an
archive-quality air filtering system, a complete microfilm
processing laboratory and six storage rooms, each measuring 200 feet
long and 25 feet high.
   Ready to process records as they arrive from overseas is a
library staff that collectively is fluent in nearly every major
language. On the library floor, staff linguists are available to
assist patrons.
   ``There's nothing comparable to the library in terms of its
comprehensive nature,'' said Jay Hall, director of Global Research,
a Salt Lake City-based professional genealogical service affiliated
with Everton Publishing, which produces a directory of genealogical
sources called the Genealogical Helper.
   Hall said 98 percent of his business is with non-Mormons living
outside of Utah. Likewise, most of the Genealogical Helper's 50,000
subscribers are not Mormon and do not live in Utah.
   ``There's a vast amount of interest,'' Hall said. ``A lot of
people think it's totally fascinating to learn about their
ancestors. It gives them a feeling of heritage. For the
professional, the most important thing is to have the detective

   A two-generation gap is being wiped away in travel these days:
grandparents are often traveling with grandchildren. And tour
operators are designing trips especially geared for grandparents _
or great-aunts and -uncles, or surrogate grandparents _ traveling
with youngsters two generations down the line.
   Helene Koenig, founder and owner of The Ticket Counter, a travel
agency in Chevy Chase, Md., says she decided to create Grandtravel
when she herself learned a few years ago that she was going to be a
grandmother. Grandtravel's offerings range from the Washington area
to American Indian country in the Southwest, the Alaskan wilderness,
Dutch waterways and canals, New Zealand and Hawaii.
   The youngsters usually range in ages from 7 to 14. The oldest
``grandparent'' so far has been an unmarried gentleman of 79 who,
Mrs. Koenig says, just wanted to see how the idea worked.
   Mrs. Koenig matches her itineraries to the energy and interests
of both generations. So it's not surprising that the Tower of London
and Madame Tussaud's Waxworks are part of a British tour, or that
children may enjoy water sports, weather permitting, while their
grandparents visit the Aalsmeer flower auction in the Netherlands.
   But the favorite trip of young and old alike, Mrs. Koenig says,
is definitely the African safari. ``You never outgrow your love for
a lion,'' she said in a telephone interview.
   El Al, the Israeli airline, and AARP, the American Association of
Retired Persons, also are in the act.
   El Al aims to give the older generation an opportunity to
acquaint the youngsters with their Jewish heritage in Israel. And
again, keeping in mind the needs of old and young, the itinerary
includes a Biblical Zoo of species of animals that were living in
Biblical times, the stalagmite caves southwest of Jerusalem, and a
chance for the kids to float in the highly saline Dead Sea, as well
as more obvious attractions.
   Alice Gregory, marketing manager for the AARP's Travel Service,
says its program started only last year, with one devoted to an
American heritage area including Washington, D.C., and another to a
European destination. It is now planning to include tours covering
national parks, London, Rome and Amsterdam, and perhaps other
destinations.
   An agent for Saga International, a Boston-based branch of a
British company of the same name that specializes in travel for
seniors, says it has been conducting grandchildren-grandparent
travel ever since it began business in the United States in 1982.
The children may not be over 16, the grandparents must be at least
60.
   In all cases, most of the tours are in summer, when children are
out of school.
   Mrs. Koenig sees today's grandparents as already sophisticated
travelers, and ``in really good shape, aerobically fit and
nutritionally sound,'' and often more relaxed financially than the
grandchild's own parents. Often, grandparents and grandchildren live
far apart.
   Mrs. Ann Callison of Magnolia, Ark., and Mrs. Betty Edwards of
Jackson, Miss., are a couple of grandparents who have made trips
with Grandtravel.
   Mrs. Callison took grandchildren Christopher and Vanessa
Callison-Burch, aged 11 and 9 respectively, on the Washington area
heritage trip and says they enjoyed every minute. She told the
Associated Press that she probably would have started taking them
places on her own, to introduce them to the excitement of travel at
a young age just as her parents introduced her, but saw a
Grandtravel ad and decided to give it a try. It seems to have
worked, for she planned to add 7-year-old Alexa Callison-Burch to
the party this year, to visit the southwestern American Indian
territory. Mrs. Callison says she finds group travel a good idea for
youngsters because they meet others of their age group.
   Mrs. Edwards took 11-year-old Elizabeth Edwards on the National
Park tour last year. She says she chose group travel because she
cannot drive great distances. She also says that although she sees
her grandchildren about twice a week at home in Jackson, she saw a
whole new facet of Elizabeth on the trip and in the one-on-one
relationship it engendered. She is firmly against taking more than
one child at a time, feeling that a major purpose of such travel is
to get closer to one another minus sibling rivalries. This year,
it's the turn of Elizabeth's 9-year-old sister, Margaret.
Destination: the Southwest Indian country. Grandson Stephen Edwards
Jr. is only 5, but Mrs. Edwards says he's already telling everyone
that his turn is coming. His grandmother is guessing he'll choose
the Kenya safari.

   The work force is graying, and the help-hungry hotel business,
with annual turnover it says is 100 percent, is aggressively
courting older workers.
   Days Inn of America this spring held a national job fair, Senior
Power, and managed to pull in job applications from 5,000 older job
seekers for its 850 franchises and 634 other service-sector
companies who participated.
   American Hotel &amp; Motel Association President Elaine Grossinger
Etess has asked older job seekers _ as well as those with
disabilities _ to send letters or resumes to her or to local hotels
and motels. She promises she'll personally read all those received
at AH-MA headquarters in Washington before forwarding them to
members in applicants' localities. The organization represents over
9,000 lodgings in the United States.
   Tourism and travel is the nation's fastest-growing industry and
is expected to be the country's main employer by next year. The
industry projects a minimum need of 800,000 more employees over the
next decade.
   The AH-MA campaign is aimed at informing retired and semi-retired
men and women about job possibilities in the hotel business,
emphasizing that people skills and practical ability are more
important than academic credentials.
   ``The opportunities are not all minimum wage, either,'' says Mrs.
Etess. She cites flex-time and part- or full-time options, along
with on-the-job training and job advancement courses, as especially
advantageous to seniors.
   ``Older people are ideal employees in the service business,''
Mrs. Etess says. ``The older worker is more patient, tolerant, and
has a strong work ethic.''
   Days Inn President Michael A. Leven adds that older workers also
show a willingness to learn new skills and have better records
against absenteeism, tardiness and turnover, pointing to his
experience with senior staff at his Atlanta headquarters.
   Typical jobs for seniors are as desk clerks, sales
representatives, groundskeepers, telephone operators, security
officers, managers, auditors, housekeepers, cooks, van drivers,
bellhops, waitresses and waiters.
   The job fair, held simultaneously last May 6 at 64 Days Inn
franchises, included participation from other companies which were
nearly all from the service sector: Kelly Services, Wendy's,
McDonald's, K mart, Sears, Kroger, local banks, schools, libraries,
museums, hospitals, grocery stores, restaurants, and various retail
outlets.
   Days Inn says it is the first organization to organize a national
event aimed at employing older people. The success of the fair has
prompted the chain to make it an annual event. The 1990 Senior Power
job fair will be staged at 100 hotels next May 5.
   Mrs. Etess, a member of the family that founded and ran the
Grossinger's resort and the first woman president of AH-MA, notes
that more than 60 million citizens over 50 are capable of working at
least part time. ``As many as three-fourths are not employed. It is
a tragedy for productive people and a serious under-utilization of a
prime human resource,'' she says.

   You're never too old to get into the game.
   Proof comes from the Games Gang, a young company started by older
entrepreneurs which hit the jackpot, so to speak, with Pictionary,
currently the best-selling board game in the business.
   The Games Gang was founded in 1986 by a group of toy industry
veterans who found themselves out of work when their previous
employer, Selchow and Righter (the Trivial Pursuit company), was
bought out by Coleco (the Cabbage Patch Doll company).
   Rather than retire, they decided to pool their knowhow with Joe
Cornacchia, 57, an old friend who had been one of S and R's
contractors, to put together a new enterprise. Along with Tom
McGuire, an S and R veteran who had left the company earlier, the
founding group included Hudson Dobson, 68; Angelo Longo, 61; Tom
McGrath, 60; Frank Martin, 57; Kevin McNulty, 38; Mike Gasser, 35;
and Bill Napier, who has since died. Cornacchia is president of the
young company, and McGuire is vice president of sales and marketing.
   When Cornacchia contacted McGuire, he found he had been
independently representing Rob Angel, the inventor of Pictionary, a
board game that had done well in the Northwest market. The Games
Gang signed an agreement and made Pictionary its first product.
   With seed money of about $250,000, they began marketing the new
game nationally. Within six months they had 300,000 orders; by 1988
sales exceeded $125 million, making The Games Gang one of the top
board games companies around.
   With something like 13 million copies of Pictionary sold, the
group is now developing offshoots and other new games. One of the
newest entries is called Gender Bender, a role reversal game that
was developed by Chris Haney, co-inventor of Trivial Pursuit.
   One of the ironies of this self-described ``Over the Hill Gang''
is that they say they've made their biggest impact in the youth
market.

   You have property you want to continue living on, but you also
want to settle the question of who you give it to when you die _
preferably maximizing its value and minimizing taxes.
   Or possibly you need greater current income and look to your
assets as a source, but you find that the capital gains penalty will
prevent their profitable sale.
   What to do?
   Charitable trusts and gift annuities made to institutions like
schools are one legal way to have your cake and eat it, too.
   Alf and Betty Thompson still live on their lakefront property in
Illinois, even though they have deeded it to Millikin University in
Decatur.
   ``We spent 25 years building up our land and didn't want to just
let it go,'' says Alf Thompson. ``While we did get a gift tax
deduction, the more important benefit for us was helping Millikin
carry on our development here.''
   The Thompsons have planted hundreds of trees, shrubs and flowers
on the property, which has grown from 12.5 to nearly 20 acres since
they deeded it to the school. With their blessing, Millikin already
is using it for meetings, and the land will be turned into a retreat
for the school when the Thompsons die or give up life tenancy.
   If Elsie Welter had sold her 25 acres of land and an apartment
house in Minnesota worth $500,000, she would have failed to realize
a profit because of the capital gains penalty. So instead she
established a charitable gift annuity by donating the property to
her alma mater, Concordia College in Moorehead, Minn. That way, she
supported one of her favorite causes, education, and at the same
time got a large tax deduction and continues to receive guaranteed
annuity checks from the school.
   ``If Elsie had sold her real estate outright, the capital gains
tax would have been tremendous,'' says John Pierce, director of
planned giving at Concordia. ``It would have cut her earning power
incredibly. The annuity gives her the cash flow to continue living
life the way she wants to.''
   People who want their assets to go to colleges can use charitable
trusts and gift annuities to donate money, property, or appreciated
securities while continuing to receive income from those assets
during their lifetimes. Most universities have planned giving
offices to advise and help them manage donations so they can take
advantage of tax incentives and savings.
   ``There are different options to fit each donor's needs,'' says
Bob Nourse, associate director of planned giving at Lafayette
College in Easton, Pa. ``We work closely with each individual to
find the right one.''
   Most schools offer a pooled income fund, in which a number of
individual donations are combined and invested cooperatively.
   Another possibility is a deferred payment gift annuity, which
lets younger investors donate now and receive annual income payments
after retirement.
   Charitable gift annuities like Elsie Welter's are irrevocable;
the university owns the principal while guaranteeing an income for
life based on a fixed percentage rate. Others, like the revocable
charitable remainder trust, lets donors control principal and add,
withdraw or transfer funds at any time _ even opening a bank account
in trust for the university. Revocable trusts don't provide current
income tax benefits, but they do provide estate tax benefits after
death.
   ``Trusts and annuities allow an enormous amount of flexibility,''
says Mark Elliott, director of planned giving at Bucknell University
in Lewisburg, Pa. ``They can offer guaranteed payments, high income,
growth, or some combination of all three.''

   More people might use living wills to avoid futile
medical treatment if the documents set down specific guidelines for
care rather than rejecting vague ``heroic measures'' to maintain
life, two doctors say.
   Only 9 percent of Americans have living wills, although the wills
are recognized legally in more than 75 percent of the states, the
doctors noted recently in the Journal of the American Medical
Association.
   People can use living wills to instruct doctors and families that
they do not want to be kept alive indefinitely by mechanical means,
such as respirators, if they become ill or injured with no hope of
recovery.
   Samples of living wills ``are apparently not reaching physicians'
offices or hospitals,'' write the doctors, Linda L. Emanuel of
Massachusetts General Hospital and Ezekiel J. Emanuel of Beth Israel
Hospital in Boston.
   They recommend a document that outlines right-to-die dilemmas and
appropriate treatments.
   The doctors say that living wills tend to be written in vague
terms, such as instructions to stop care when ``there is no
reasonable expectation ... of recovery'' or when such care
constitutes ``heroic measures.''
   Such phrases ``are open to multiple interpretations on when to
act and on what interventions the patient would desire,'' say the
doctors.
   People who sign living wills often do so without discussion with
their doctors, leaving them ignorant of their wishes, the authors
say.
   Many choose to give all decision-making authority to a relative,
but the doctors cite surveys that show the relative often does not
know what type of care the patient would want.
   In the article, the doctors propose a document that would clarify
what treatments the patient thinks acceptable in four situations:
   _ A coma ``with no known hope'' of regaining awareness.
   _ A coma with a ``small likelihood'' of recovering fully, a
``slightly larger likelihood'' of recovering with brain damage, and
a ``much larger likelihood'' of dying.
   _ Irreversible brain damage or disease, accompanied by a terminal
illness.
   _ Irreversible brain damage or disease that makes speaking or
recognizing people impossible but is not accompanied by terminal
illness.
   For each category, the document would list 12 possible
treatments, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical
breathing, artificial feeding, surgery, drugs and simple diagnostic
tests.
   The form would not eliminate all medical or legal uncertainty,
but it would ``provide a tangible expression of the patient's
wishes,'' the doctors say.

   As you age, you need to exercise as much as ever, say health
experts. Regular exercise can help you maintain flexibility and
endurance.
   At the same time, you should be wary of of potential injury,
according to Dr. Gil Allen, vice president of the New York State
Chiropractic Association. He offers these tips to maximize the
benefits of exercise and minimize the possibility of getting hurt:
   _ Check with your doctor before starting any exercise program,
especially if you've been inactive for a while.
   _ Choose an exercise that you can do and will enjoy.
   _ Take it slow and steady. Remember, your body isn't 20 years old
any more, so allow time for your muscles to adapt to the added work
you're giving them. First try working out on alternate days, then
gradually increase intensity and duration.
   _ Consider your body type when choosing an exercise. People with
slender, angular frames usually don't have sufficient muscle mass
for high-strength exercises but do well in endurance activities such
as long-distance running or cross-country skiing. Overweight people
should be wary of putting too much pressure on joints or risk stress
injuries by running; they're better off with moderate aerobic
activities like biking, swimming and walking.
   _ Warm up and cool down. Exercise slowly at first to limber up
and get blood flowing into muscles and joints. This will increase
muscle elasticity and help prevent injury. Cool down for five
minutes by stretching; stretches should be slow and not painful.
   _ Pain signals injury, so pay attention to it. Be alert for pain
in bones, joints, or muscles; spasms or swelling; joint stiffness;
restricted motion; or numbness or tingling in a hand or foot. Use
the R-I-C-E (Rest-Ice-Compression-Elevation) treatment as first aid
and continue until pain and swelling are gone. Sprains are serious
and require immobilization of the injured part.

   Fewer people now lose their teeth as they age, thanks to greater
knowledge about dental hygiene, fluoridation, and more sophisticated
skills used by dentists.
   You can increase your chances of saving your teeth with proper
care and awareness of the types of problems that can develop as you
age, according to Pamela Parker Brangan, associate professor of
dental hygiene at Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Va. She offers
these tips:
   _ Fight tooth decay _ which most often occurs in the root at the
gum line _ by limiting sweets and brushing near the gum line with a
soft brush. Ms. Brangan points out that the roots are not covered by
enamel and are especially vulnerable to rapid decay. She notes that
hard toothbrushes are not only ineffective at cleaning at the gum
line but can abrade the root surface, sensitizing teeth to hot and
cold.
   _ Be alert to signs of gingivitis such as red, swollen and tender
gums that may bleed when brushed or flossed. This form of
periodontal disease, which develops slowly and progressively, causes
more tooth loss in people over 40 than any other problem, says Ms.
Brangan. Gingivitis can be prevented or reversed with daily care,
along with consultation with a dentist or dental hygienist. They can
recommend a proper cleaning routine and determine if hard deposits
need to be removed or fillings re-filled. The advanced form of this
disease is called periodontitis and is characterized by loose teeth,
receded gums, bad breath or bad taste in the mouth, and pus between
gums and teeth. Left untreated, periodontitis usually ends in tooth
loss.
   _ Offset dry mouth by trying a saliva substitute or consulting
with your doctor about changing medications, which can contribute to
the problem. Saliva production decreases with age, and because it
helps protect teeth from plaque, this can contribute to decay as
well as cause discomfort. Denture wearers also are likely to
experience discomfort because saliva is normally needed to form a
seal between dentures and soft gum tissues.
   _ Don't overcompensate for the natural decline of taste buds by
adding extra salt and sugar to foods.
   _ Take care of your dentures. Daily hygiene continues to be
important, since plaque and calculus form on dentures as they do on
natural teeth, causing irritation to the gum tissue and often
leading to oral lesions under dentures. Dentures should be rinsed
after meals and brushed once a day. Ms. Brangan recommends using a
non-abrasive cleaner and a toothbrush, cleaning the outer surfaces
with the flat portion of the brush and inner surfaces with the tip.
The tip also works well for cleaning clasps of partial dentures, she
says. Finish by thoroughly rinsing.
   _ Avoid long-term or severe sun exposure or excessive use of
tobacco or alcohol, since all contribute to possible cancers.

   The older person who has trouble remembering
simple things like the route to a friend's house or a store in his
neighborhood can use basic navigation principles to overcome the
problem, say researchers at the Catholic University of America.
   Consciously using landmark identification the same way as ships
or hikers can help the older person keep track of the way, according
to Paula Darby Lipman of Rockville, Md., a recent Ph.D. graduate.
Ms. Lipman and James E. Youniss, CUA professor, organized a study to
determine how people of various ages remembered routes as part of
their research on age-related memory function. They ``walked''
members of their study groups through slides representing trips
through neighborhoods.
   ``Older persons tended to make a lot more personal associations
with the routes. Younger persons looked strictly for ways to
remember the routes. When I interviewed the oldest subjects, they
often mentioned the flowers in the trees, the condition of the
neighborhood, or the season,'' says Ms. Lipman.
   She says that older people may have wanted to make the
identifying task more meaningful or personal to offset the burden of
coping with all the information presented. But her study confirmed
that those who concentrated on landmarks at turns were best able to
recreate the routes from unordered slides.
   ``There's so much information you can get from any route. It's
just that some of it is more important. Picking out the information
that will help in remembering turns is easier than trying to
remember all the landmarks in sequential order,'' she says.
   The study supports a widely held theory about aging and memory _
that for many people, short-term memory decreases with age. Though
some seem to use the landmark strategy naturally, others can learn
the technique with a conscious effort, Ms. Lipman says.

   That comforting amenity of memory, the
doctor's house call, still exists.
   Dr. James Mold, for one, still makes house calls to elderly
patients and says he finds them useful and, in fact, enjoyable.
   ``There are a variety of reasons physicians still make them,''
says Mold, assistant professor of family medicine and director of
the geriatrics program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences
Center. ``One reason I make house calls is that they allow me to get
to know patients in a way I can't during a regular office call.''
   Mold says that the home setting often alerts him to problems like
overuse of medication or alcohol abuse _ things he might miss during
an office appointment.
   ``With geriatric patients, how they function is often much more
important than diagnosing disease,'' he says. ``The place where
people function is in their home, so it's crucial in some cases that
you actually see what the person is dealing with.''
   Mold says the home setting is more relaxing and reassuring to the
patient, and he often can get a more accurate blood pressure reading.
   But the negative side has to be considered, too, he says. The
doctor can't rely on staff and equipment backup that he has at his
office. There also is the cost, which isn't covered by fees.
   Despite these drawbacks, he predicts that a doctors will make
more house calls in the future, owing to the greater number of older
people and to the interest in home health care to shorten hospital
stays. Doctors probably will be working closely with home care
agencies, he says.
   Patients who are too frail to make trips to the office or don't
have transportation shouldn't hesitate to ask their doctors to come
to them, he adds.
   ``Personally, I find house calls very enjoyable. I feel more
comfortable, and the patients feel more comfortable,'' he says.
``People are appreciative when I take the time to come out, and
everyone likes to be appreciated.''

   Organizing caregiving in a businesslike way can defuse emotional
tension when you find yourself responsible for the care of an aging
parent or relative, says JoanEllen Foyder, author of ``The Family
Caregiver's Guide.''
   Foyder, of Yonkers, N.Y., is a former shopping mall management
executive who cared for her mother through a difficult Parkinson's
disease illness. That the responsibility fell on her as the closest
female relative was typical, since the majority of caregivers are
women, regardless of the number of male relatives.
   What wasn't typical was her response. ``Once I realized it was
sink or swim, I took it on as a business assignment,'' she says. She
organized charts, schedules and plotted ways to involve other
members of the family and even visitors.
   These are incorporated in her book, which the publishers say is
the first guide on the subject for non-professionals.
   She advises the caregiver to avoid the martyr role and to speak
up for her own needs. By giving copies of a care schedule to other
members of the family, they will become aware of just how many hours
each task takes and the size of the burden she's handling.
   She should ask for on-site help from each member of the family or
money to pay for professional help to give the caregiver respite. A
written family agreement will defuse many feelings of guilt or
resentment about the responsibilities, she says.

   Older adults can cut the strain of housework through organization

   Gary Van Deursen, Black and Decker's director of industrial
design and new product concepts, says his research shows that 40
percent of Americans 65 or older have problems doing housework and
operating appliances. Manufacturers now recognize that older people
need appliances that are easy to operate and simple to maintain, he
says.
   He offers these tips to make the best of them and lighten the
work:
   _ Don't strain your back by dragging around a full-sized vacuum
cleaner when a lightweight stick-type vacuum will do the same work.
   _ Cordless vacuums are another back-saver. Hand-held models are
more convenient for small messes and quick pickups.
   _ To pick up dust that accumulates underneath beds or sofas,
choose a cleaner that will operate in both upright and horizontal
positions. That way, you won't have to move furniture.
   _ When cleaning or dusting, start from the top of the room and
work down. A hand-held vacuum that has attachments that can reach
high areas like curtains and ceiling corners and a crevice tool for
getting into door tracks and under radiators will save hands-on
dusting.
   _ Look for a hand-held model designed to balance its weight under
the handle instead of in front of it. Also check if it has a lock-on
or slide switch instead of a button that must be pushed and held
down while cleaning. If you have arthritis, you'll find the
appliance easier to grip if you wrap a soft towel or cloth around
the handle for additional width and comfort.
   _ To deal with pet hair, choose a unit that has a motorized power
brush attachment with both long and short bristles.
   _ Clean spills and stains immediately, as chances for easy
removal are 75 percent greater if a stain is fresh. Spills of wax,
chocolate, crayon and bubble gum shoud be allowed to dry until they
are hard enough to scrape off with a dull knife.

   A California study indicates that older people
who take a driver training refresher courses may have fewer traffic
convictions and serious accidents than do non-participants.
   The report cautioned that drivers who took part in a voluntary
program on which the study is based were ``a highly self-selected
group who would be expected ... to have lower subsequent accident
rates.''
   Nevertheless, it said, there was ``suggestive evidence'' that the
driver training course helped reduce accident risk.
   ``We feel the results are quite suggestive and promising,'' said
Ray Peck, director of research for the California Department of
Motor Vehicles.
   Drivers over age 65 are second only to those age 15 to 24 in
traffic accidents, and when the number of miles driven is taken into
account, the two groups are almost equal.
   Results of the California study were released here by the
nation's largest senior citizen organization, the American
Association of Retired Persons.
   AARP President-elect Robert Maxwell said the study shows
refresher courses are ``one way older drivers can remain safe
drivers longer.
   ``To lose the ability to drive often traps older people in their
homes. Because of that, we are dedicated to helping older drivers
remain safe drivers.''
   The California study compared driving records for 40,339
graduates of the state's Mature Driver Improvement Program with
those of 75,064 older drivers who did not take the course. All were
age 55 or above.
   Adjusting the results to factor out differences between the two
groups, the graduates had 16 percent fewer accidents involving death
or injury and 15.7 percent fewer traffic convictions.
   Most of the participants in the California program took the ``55
Alive'' course developed by AARP. California drivers over age 55 who
take an approved refresher course are eligible for reduced auto
insurance premiums.

   After her high school graduation in 1918, Edith Levy stopped
taking piano lessons.
   But when she started a part-time job as a receptionist at
Chicago's Sherwood Conservatory of Music two years ago, she got the
idea to resume piano study _ nearly 70 years later.
   ``The piano had always been an important part of my life, and
there I was in an environment where people were playing the music
I'd always loved most _ classical music,'' says Levy, now 87.
   Having completed a group piano class and begun bi-weekly private
lessons, her current project is a complex piece by Bach.
   ``As my granddaughter puts it, I've never been the kind of
grandmother who just sits at home and knits,'' she says. ``I enjoy
being active, and playing the piano gives me that opportunity.''
   One of Levy's fellow students at the conservatory is 67-year-old
Weldon Hall, who began piano study while in his 50s. Now that he's
retired, Hall spends more time than ever practicing the piano _
about 90 minutes each day.
   ``I never could have found that much time to practice while I was
working,'' he says. ``Now I have a real sense of accomplishment
because I've mastered some very difficult pieces _ and I've overcome
my shyness about playing in front of other people.''
   Brenda Dillon, a Dallas-based piano teacher who teaches several
older adults, believes self-confidence is the most important factor
determining whether or not they succeed at piano study.
   ``There's a myth that older people have lesser abilities to
memorize and perform, and that's just what it is _ a myth,'' she
insists. ``The only handicap I see in older piano students is that
sometimes they start believing the myth themselves.''
   Dillon reminds her older students that whatever physical
difficulties they may have, technical problems can be found in piano
students of all ages, ``and with older people, often their great
enthusiasm and self-discipline more than makes up for any physical
challenges they may have.''
   At the Sherwood conservatory, piano teacher Harry Davidson _ who
counts Hall and Levy among a half-dozen students over age 65 _
agrees. He says:
   ``Of course, you notice a person's age initially, but once
lessons get going, I forget about it. I have the same expectations
and requirements of all my students, regardless of age.''
   At the Southeast Senior Center for Independent Living in
Englewood, N.J., officials point to a remarkable example of older
pianists overcoming physical adversity in an ingenious way.
   Ruth Eisenberg, 86, and Margaret Patrick, 75, met at a
post-stroke group session at the center. Both had enjoyed playing
piano in the past but had to stop. Eisenberg had been paralyzed on
the left side and Patrick on the right side.
   ``This idea just came to me,'' recalls Millie McHugh, a director
at the center. ``I looked at both of them and said, `You've got a
right hand and you've got a left hand. Now, let me hear some
Chopin'.''
   Through their joint playing of solo piano pieces, the two women
have discovered the true meaning of teamwork.
   ``Sometimes because of my arthritis, I have to stop playing for a
while,'' explains Eisenberg. ``But Margaret just takes over for me
and improvises a few measures until I regain my composure.''
   The pair _ who call themselves Ebony and Ivory _ now play
regularly at the center, and have begun lining up some performance
engagements in other parts of the country.

   Older adults often neglect eye problems because of the lack of
insurance coverage for preventive eye care, says an optometrist
writing in the Journal of the American Optometric Association.
   ``The availability of private health insurance covering vision
care is the lowest for the elderly,'' writes Dr. Satya B. Verma, an
optometrist at the Pennsylvania College of Optometry in Philadelphia.
   Verma cites figures from the National Center for Health
Statistics which show that visits to the eye doctor drop 50 percent
once the average person retires. Another NCHS study shows that
private health insurance pays for only 4.2 percent of eyeglasses for
the elderly, while it pays for 10.2 percent for those between 25 and
54 years old.
   Medicare in 1987 began covering the eye health part of an
optometric examination if prompted by a symptom or complaint. Yet
routine preventive examinations are still excluded from coverage,
Verma points out.
   ``Reimbursement of preventive vision care will help reduce
blindness,'' he says. --_
   Walking may be the best all around exercise for seniors, says one
sports medicine specialist.
   ``We often advise a regimen of low-impact conditioning, such as
that afforded by walking,'' says Dr. Ann Ward of the University of
Massachusetts Medical School's Department of exercise physiology.
   Advantages include overall toning and cardiovascular development,
with little risk of injury.
   ``Intensive exercise is not a prerequisite to senior fitness,''
she says. --_
   A breathing disorder known as sleep apnea can sometimes be the
reason elderly people need midday naps, say researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.
   Sleep apnea interrupts breathing during nighttime sleep and
leaves the person tired in the morning. Dr. Alan Pack, associate
professor in the cardiovascular pulmonary division of the school,
says that as many as one third of people over 65 may have the
disorder but don't realize it.
   Apnea causes the pharyngeal muscles to relax and block airway
passages in the throat, says Pack. This stops breathing from 10
seconds to a minute and alerts the brain to open the airway. The
brain ``awakens'' and prevents the sleeper from entering deep sleep,
or REM.
   Men, overweight people (particularly around the neck), and people
with nasal problems or jaw abnormalities are most likely to be
affected. It's often the spouse of the patient who notices the
problem.
   A box-like mask instrument that forces air through the throat can
be used to treat the disorder. Surgery to remove excess tissue in
the back of the throat may be called for. --_
   If you're over 50, walking is likely to be your favorite form of
exercise. A study sponsored by Dr. Scholl's found that 39 percent of
people 50 or older exercise regularly and walking is their leading
form of workout.
   But the study, in cooperation with the American Podiatric Medical
Association, found that three-quarters of adults polled said they
experienced sore feet.
   Taking care of your feet will increase your pain-free mileage.
Well-cushioned, well-fitted shoes and a daily foot grooming routine
is recommended by Dr. Scholl's for keeping your feet in good
condition:
   _ Soak your feet in lukewarm (not hot) water to help soften skin
and relax tense muscles.
   _ Use a pumice stone or file to reduce hardened skin and avoid
callus buildup.
   _ Apply a moisturizing lotion to soften skin.
   _ Cut nails straight across to avoid ingrown toenails.
   _ Apply a spritz of foot deodorant or antifungal powder to keep
feet dry and prevent odor or athlete's foot.
   _ Massage feet, then elevate them above hip level for about 15
minutes.
   _ Check feet for red, tender spots that may signal blisters.
Moleskin should be placed around but not on tender spots to prevent
further irritation. _ Make sure your shoes fit to avoid buildup of
corns and calluses. If these do develop, pad them with adhesive
cushions. --_

   Freshly revised, the new edition of ``Unbelievably Good Deals &amp;
Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over
50'' (Contemporary Books) can help older people cash in on special
rates in travel and other services.
   Author Joan Ratner Heilman has added new information about
seniors' organizations and the benefits they offer, as well a
chapter for the older single. Prices and conditions of travel and
other bargains have been updated from the first edition of the
paperback in l988. These include airfares, though Ms. Heilman points
out that airlines' pricing policies fluctuate and should be checked
before booking.
   Much of the book is devoted to travel, but it also covers bargain
opportunities in education, sports, stores, restaurants, taxes and
insurance. Books and magazines of interest to older people also are
listed.
   The book costs $6.95 in stores or can be ordered by mail (Best
Publications, 180 N. Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill. 60601) for $8.50.

   Most older Americans want to see national parks, natural wonders
and historic sites on their vacations, according to a National Tour
Association survey.
   The NTA study polled 1,750 Americans 50 or more years old. Of
these, 53.1 percent said they preferred national parks and natural
wonders; 52.3 percent selected historical sites.
   Warm weather destinations also are popular, polling 47.1 percent,
while fall foliage tours are favored by 42.6 percent. Vacations
featuring festivals and other special events drew a positive
response from 30.1 percent of the survey participants.
   NTA says the survey shows that mature Americans who travel expect
to be healthier longer and feel better about their age than those
who stay at home. Among the polling group, 71.1 percent feel their
50-plus years are their personal ``best of times.''
   NTA, the group travel industry organization based in Lexington,
Ky., estimates older travelers generate $12.8 billion each year for
their industry _ 80 percent of all leisure travel. --_
   Planning your retirement ahead of time can offset the stress of
this life change and make the transition smoother, say geriatric
psychiatrists at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine
in Philadelphia.
   People nearing retirement should try to balance their interests,
says Dr. George E. Ruff, professor of psychiatry at Penn. ``It is
important for people of any age to maintain interests outside their
jobs. Hobbies provide a sense of self-worth and importance that
replace the role of the job during retirement.''
   Up to 15 percent of retirees suffer depression after leaving
work, says Dr. Gary Gottlieb, director of Penn's geriatric
psychiatry program. ``Aging changes a person's life in many
fundamental ways _ health can decline, relationships can change, the
ability to work can decrease _ any of which can change how people
feel about themselves.''
   Gottlieb estimates that the average person over 65 takes as many
as eight medications a day, and this ``polypharmacy'' can contribute
to depression. --_
   Executives over 40, especially women, appear to be the most
motivated in improving their communications skills, according to a
survey conducted by the Olsten Corporation, a temporary services
provider based in Westbury, N.Y.
   The survey, based on interviews with Fortune 1000 executives,
found that over 70 percent of women executives over 40 and 52
percent of male executives in the same age range participate in
skills improvement courses offered by their companies.
   The survey showed that executives under 40 of both sexes were
less likely to take advantage of the courses _ 60 percent of the
women and over two thirds of the men did not take improvement
courses.
   Olsten says it conducts surveys on business-related subjects to
determine workplace trends.

   More than two dozen states have acted in the last three years to
improve guardianships, but experts complain that courts still don't
protect the rights of the elderly, some laws don't have teeth and
others are simply ignored.
   ``The real abuse has been in the supervision of the
guardianships,'' said John Regan, a professor of health care law at
Hofstra University. ``You can have the best laws in the world, but
if no one is paying attention to the system, the laws aren't worth a
damn.''
   Under guardianship, old people judged unable to care for
themselves or their finances are made wards of the court and
assigned guardians. This strips the wards of control over their
lives, including where they can live, what medical treatment they
receive and how their money is spent.
   Some 500,000 elderly Americans are believed to be under
guardianship.
   An Associated Press study of laws and cases in all 50 states
found old people were being placed under guardianship without legal
representation, often without their knowledge. Once under the
supposed protection of the court, some were abused and their money
misspent because no one monitored their welfare.
   As a result of a 1987 series of stories based on the study,
congressional hearings, efforts of the American Bar Association and
a growing advocacy of the elderly, at least 24 states have looked
anew at their guardianship systems.
   ``It's an issue that is not going to go away,'' said Shelda
Harden, a staff associate with the National Conference of State
Legislators. ``It is going to be on the front burner as the
population gets older.''
   Major changes in Indiana, Michigan, Oregon, Utah and Washington
state required courts to take greater steps to ensure protection of
the rights of potential wards, including detailed investigations of
guardianship petitions and representation of wards by attorneys.
   The laws also established alternatives to guardianship and
encouraged guardianships tailored to the individual, a step that
eliminates the wholesale deprivation of a ward's rights. Other
states have taken this step, including West Virginia, Oklahoma, New
Mexico and Rhode Island.
   Still others revised their laws. Some of the changes simply
cleared up questions of law. Others make it harder to place a person
under guardianship, better define guardians' duties and establish
more oversight on how a guardian uses the ward's money. States in
this category include Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Hawaii,
Iowa, Kansas, North Carolina.
   Guardianship laws are pending in Illinois, New Jersey, New York
and Pennsylvania. Legislative study committees were formed in
Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Rhode Island and Texas.
   Additionally, three bills are before Congress that would
establish federal standards for guardianship.
   All are similar to legislation introduced by the late Rep. Claude
Pepper, D-Fla. His bill would require that wards be better notified
about guardianship proceedings and be represented by attorneys, and
mandates better training for guardians and an annual review of
guardianship cases by the courts.
   States that fail to enforce the standards would face loss of
federal funds. While many oppose the law as federal intrusion into a
traditional state role, there is support from those involved in
guardianship.
   ``I think there has to be more protection,'' said Patrick Murphy,
the Cook County, Ill., public guardian. Illinois requires regular
accountings of wards' estates, yet only one in four cases is up to
date.
   ``Right now there's really nobody here looking over the shoulder
of private guardians making sure they're doing a good job,'' said
Murphy.
   Legislative action doesn't ensure that the rights of the elderly
will be protected, even under new laws. The Rhode Island Legislature
passed a bill in 1986 to establish limited guardianships _ limiting
the guardians' powers to specific issues such as medical care or
financial matters.
   But when questioned by the AP, neither the director of the state
Department of Elderly Affairs nor the chairman of a state bar
probate committee was aware the law had passed. One judge said he
didn't understand it and hadn't used it. And a committee established
last year to study guardianship has yet to meet.
   New Jersey legislators created a public guardian's office in 1986
to provide services for people without guardians. But despite an
increase in the number of wards to 300, the office's budget has been
cut this year.
   Marie Muhler, New Jersey's public guardian, complains she has
three caseworkers for the 300 wards and has had to ask state courts
to stop assigning her new cases. ``When they gave me the job, they
said, `Tell us what you need and you'll get it.' The first year I
got 20 percent of what I asked.
   ``It's a question of them coming to grips with dealing with the
problems of the elderly.''
   Even with good laws and administration, there remains potential
for abuse. While most states required courts to review annual
accountings by guardians, nearly half the case files examined by the
AP were missing at least one accounting.
   The ABA, whose House of Delegates this year recommended sweeping
changes along the same lines as state and federal legislation, will
study enforcement of the laws in California, Maryland and four
states still to be chosen.
   ``Cleaning up legislative problems is only the first step,'' said
Nancy Coleman, director of the ABA's Commission on Legal Problems of
the Elderly. ``You've always got implementation problems that are as
troublesome as the initial limitations with the legislation.''
   Those in the business of guardianship also are taking steps to
clean up the system. The 2-year-old National Guardianship
Association is working with its 300 members to establish training
and professional standards nationwide.
   The association, which meets in October in Atlantic City, N.J.,
also plans to discuss the possibility of certifying guardians.
   ``Many of us want to police our own to make sure that gurdianship
doesn't get a bad name,'' said Susan McMahon, association president.
``There is no question there have been problems with guardianship
and there is a need to make it a respectable profession.''

   In a state with one of the highest
percentages of elderly people, a 3-year-old change in guardianship
laws to protect the rights of prospective wards of the court has
rarely been used.
   Meanwhile, the head of the state Department of Elderly Affairs
was unaware that the legislature had made the 1986 change to allow
judges in the state's 39 probate courts to limit the powers of
court-appointed guardians and at least one judge said he didn't
understand it and hadn't used it.
   ``What it means, nobody knows yet,'' said North Providence
Probate Judge Domenic Tudino. ``Until we get some case law from the
Supreme Court,'' he said, interpretation of the measure would remain
vague.
   The intent ``was to provide the ward with as much latitude to
lead a normal life'' as possible, said the sponsor, former Rep.
Gilbert V. Indeglia. The law allows judges to limit guardianship to
just part of a ward's life, such as financial matters or medical
care.
   ``According to the affidavits of the medical people, (the wards)
are really totally gone,'' said Scituate Probate Judge Theodore A.
Miller. ``It's not a question of whether they can handle
themselves.''
   Despite the infrequent use of the limited guardianship provision,
other changes in 1986 improved the situation, Miller said. ``At one
time, just about anybody could go in and file a guardianship
petition and nobody else would have to be notified.'' Now, the
person's immediate heirs must be contacted.
   The law was also changed to require the court to appoint a
guardian ad litem, or friend of the court, to interview those in a
``medical facility,'' although no such requirement exists for those
living elsewhere.
   The determination of incompetency rests soley with a doctor, who
is not required to be in court for questioning unless the case is
contested. The ward also does not have to appear before the judge,
or to have legal representation.
   Department of Elderly Affairs Director Adelaide Luber, who
acknowledged recently that she was unaware of the changes, said
nonetheless that it is easy to label an elderly person incoherent.
``If you're the person whose bill isn't paid, you say that person
doesn't function,'' she said.
   David Reidel, chairman of the state bar's probate committee, was
unaware of the changes in the law. So was Elderly Affairs Department
protective services monitor Mary Ann Ciano, a member of a committee
established last year by the legislature to study guardianships. The
panel has yet to meet.
   Joseph Smallens, the Elderly Affairs lawyer, said he didn't know
of any cases of limited guardianship in the state. Attorneys don't
request it because ``traditionally lawyers are used to full
guardianship, probably because there is less paperwork involved. ...
A year down the road someone may have to come back and get full
guardianship'' because the person continues to deteriorate.
   Rhode Island, with 14.6 percent of its population aged 65 or
older, ranks third in the percentage of elderly residents, behind
Florida and even with Pennsylvania, according to the federal
Administration on Aging.

<HEAD>Ruling on Equal Taxation of Pensions Still Making Waves</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Denis in 8th graf is cq.</HEAD>

   Aftershocks still are rippling across the
country five months after an obscure lawsuit filed by a federal
retiree in Michigan produced a Supreme Court ruling that upset tax
laws in nearly half the states.
   States are raising, cutting and shifting taxes, federal retirees
are angling for more than a billion dollars in refunds and some
private pensioners are claiming they, too, are victims of unfair
state taxation.
   The furor began when lawyer Paul S. Davis filed suit in 1984
claiming it was unfair for Michigan to tax part of his federal
pension when the state exempted the full pensions of state and local
government retirees.
   The Supreme Court agreed, ruling in March that Davis was entitled
to a $4,299 refund and ordering states to treat federal retirees at
least as favorably as state and local retirees.
   The decision hit home in as many as 24 states that didn't tax all
government pensioners equally, 12 of which have enacted corrective
legislation, according to the National Conference of State
Legislatures.
   But instead of making all federal retirement benefits exempt,
some states have imposed new taxes on a portion of state and local
pensions.
   For example, Missouri used to provide a full exemption for state
pensions and none for federal. Now it provides a $6,000 exclusion
for all single public pensioners with income up to $25,000 and for
couples with public pensions up to $32,000; there is no exclusion
for those with higher incomes.
   Laws that exclude part of public pensions from taxation tend to
benefit state and local retirees disproportionately because their
pensions generally are lower, said Denis Harrington, of the National
Association of Retired Federal Employees.
   Harrington said he'd rather see states offer federal pensioners
the same benefits other government retirees received in the past,
``but as long as they comply with the Supreme Court ruling we
haven't got a leg to stand on.''
   The court left unsettled whether the states must refund tax
payments by federal retirees; most states are resisting refund
requests. Lawsuits seeking refunds have been filed in nearly all the
affected states, and potential claims total $1.5 billion to $2
billion for years within the states' statutes of limitation,
according to the Federation of Tax Administrators.
   Lawrence Lewy, a 75-year-old former IRS attorney, believes he is
due more than $10,000 from Virginia and is among those who have
filed suit. ``I'm not saying I won't be delighted with whatever
eventually comes if we win,'' Lewy said. ``But just the idea of the
accomplishment is a big factor.''
   Virginia has the most to lose if refunds are required _ an
estimated $370 million for a three-year period.
   Refunds so far have been forthcoming only for Davis and in
Missouri, where the state Supreme Court in May ordered $160 million
in refunds covering three years. The state will raise the money
through temporary increases in the sales and corporate income taxes.
   In Arizona, a tax judge this month ordered the state to reimburse
72,000 federal retirees up to $210 million on taxes paid from 1984
through 1988. Craig Corimier, deputy director of the Arizona
Department of Revenue, said the ruling could be ``financially
devastating'' if it stands, since the state recently had trouble
resolving a $165 million budget deficit.
   Harrington said the Missouri and Arizona rulings are encouraging,
but most states seem determined to ``go down fighting'' against the
refunds.
   ``Every time we get a favorable decision it improves the odds
dramatically. It's inevitable that they're going to have to pay
refunds of some kind.''
   Attorney Linda Riley of the Federation of Tax Administrators said
states ``are watching each other'' on the refund question, but she
cautioned that laws vary from state to state, and rulings won't
necessarily go the same everywhere.
   Harrington and Riley said many states are awaiting a Supreme
Court ruling next term on two consolidated cases that will help
determine when taxpayers are due a refund on a state tax that is
found to be unconstitutional.
   While the Davis ruling addressed only disparities in taxation of
pensions for government retirees, it has sparked interest among
private pensioners.
   A retired Teamsters union member in Missouri and a group of
private pensioners in Alabama have filed suits in their states
alleging that dissimilar tax treatment for private retirees is
unconstitutional.
   Virginia, one of the first to respond to the Davis ruling,
enacted a tax-reduction package that equalizes treatment for public
and private retirees aged 55 and older, at a cost of $70 million in
the first year and $87 million by the third. The state will exclude
the first $16,000 of pension income from taxation, reducing the
exclusion gradually for those with income from $16,001 to $40,000
and providing no exclusion for those with income over $40,000.
   Here's how the NCSL said other states have responded:
   _New York, North Dakota, West Virginia and Wisconsin extended
state preferences to federal retirees;
   _Arizona, Oregon and South Carolina repealed preferential state
pension exclusions and raised other benefits for state retirees;
   _Colorado, Iowa, Missouri and Oklahoma now provide a limited
exclusion for all public pensions;
   _Georgia and Utah have called special legislative sessions for
the fall and Michigan's full-time legislature may address the issue
yet this year;
   _Alabama, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico
and North Carolina have yet to complete action.
   In addition, Arkansas and Kansas argue they're not affected.
Arkansas says a 1985 law providing equal treatment of government
pensions after 1990 meets the requirements of the Davis ruling;
Kansas contends the ruling doesn't affect military pensions, the
only area of difference under state law.

<HEAD>Study Of Elderly Twins Raises Hopes For Aging Brains</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lissy Jarvik disliked the notion she was
doomed to get senile when she grew old, so as a young psychologist
in 1946 she began to study how age influences the brain.
   ``I didn't want to believe our intelligence would go down from
then on. It didn't seem like a good thing to face for the rest of
your life,'' said Jarvik, now a psychiatrist, pediatrician and
geriatrician.
   By giving intelligence tests to 134 pairs of elderly twins over
four decades, she concluded that old age alone doesn't rob people of
their mental abilities and that when people do get senile, it's due
to disease.
   So it's possible ``we'll die with all our marbles, and that's all
I care about,'' said Jarvik, a psychiatry professor and chief of
neuropsychogeriatrics at the University of California, Los Angeles.
Her research may help explain why some elderly people become senile,
while others remain sharp until death.
   ``I don't think mental decline is necessary in old age. We don't
know yet how to prevent it, but we have a lot of clues,'' including
the possibility that a healthy lifestyle _ including good nutrition
and exercise and avoiding drugs, alcohol, cigarettes and pollution _
may help prevent or delay senility.
   Jarvik's research also led her to speculate that people, through
lifestyle improvements, might someday live to 120 or even 150, and
that intelligence test scores might be used to identify people who
face senility and need treatment.
   Dementia, the preferred medical term, is the loss of the ability
to think clearly, express oneself intelligently and do complex
intellectual tasks.
   ``Her work certainly has contributed to change in the general
idea about what happens in normal aging,'' said psychologist David
Arenberg of the National Institute on Aging's Gerontology Research
Center in Baltimore.
   The once-controversial idea that old age doesn't necessarily doom
people to senility now is ``almost universally accepted,'' said
Arenberg, who studies how the elderly remember, learn, solve
problems and process information.
   But there still is disagreement over whether subtle loss of
people's mental faculties is due to disease.
   Jarvik said the elderly do tend to slow down mentally and
physically, and that some memory loss may be due to aging, not
disease.
   But even if mental deterioration often _ rather than always _
results from some underlying disease, there is hope that science can
learn to help people postpone any loss of their intellectual
abilities.
   Jarvik started her lifelong research project in 1946 when she
went to work for Columbia University psychiatrist Franz Kallmann.
   Kallmann had just started studying the 134 pairs of twins in
their 50s and 60s to learn what environmental factors, like
lifestyle, might be responsible for intellectual differences between
members of each pair.
   Because identical twins are genetically identical and fraternal
twins share inherited traits, scientists assume somewhat
simplistically that differences between them tend to be due to
differences in their environment.
   Jarvik took over the study a couple years later, administering
intelligence tests to the twins about every five years. Many
findings were published in the 1960s, but the study continued until
1986, after the last twins died.
   The twins didn't necessarily decline intellectually after 60.
Indeed, as their average age rose from 64 to 73, they did better on
all intelligence tests except those related to speed. Only as they
reached their 80s did scores fall.
   Jarvik's conclusion that disease, not age, was responsible, was
based on two other major findings of the study:
   _In every pair, the twin who first showed a decline on certain
intelligence test scores also was the first to die.
   _Those who initially scored low on the tests were roughly four
times more likely than high-scorers to become senile 20 years later.
   The findings ``indicate we're dealing with some sort of a disease
process that affects the brain,'' she said. Such ailments may
include those that attack the brain directly, such as Alzheimer's
disease, and ``some process taking place elsewhere in the body that
affects the blood supply to the brain.''
   That suggests that declining intelligence tests might be a way to
detect the subtle beginnings of Alzheimer's attack on the brain or
of brain impairment caused indirectly by other diseases, Jarvik
said. Older people who believe they are losing their mental
abilities might want to ``check with their doctor to see if they're
physically ill,'' she said.
   Arenberg disagreed: ``Just because a person believes his or her
mental capacity is diminishing doesn't mean that is accurate.''
   Jarvik said her study also suggests that if science ever finds a
way to prevent or treat Alzheimer's, intelligence tests could be
administered to aging people every three to five years to identify
those likely to develop dementia. ``They would be prime candidates
for a preventive approach or a treatment.''

<HEAD>New Party Aims to Galvanize West Germany's Aging Population</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Gray party, a new color on West
Germany's ever-expanding political palette, aims to unify 14 million
senior citizens and poses yet another threat to the beleaguered
party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Nearly one in three West German voters is 65, and as life
expectancy grows and the birth rate declines, they promise to
account for a hefty share of the electorate for years to come.
   Growing concerns over the future of the nation's elaborate social
security network and discontent with the established parties
prompted the West German Gray Panthers to form their own political
party last month.
   Falling in with the national penchant for adopting a color to
symbolize the party, the new political force of age advocates has
labeled itself the Grays.
   Trude Unruh, national chairman of the new party and the Gray
Panthers chapter, said the Grays already have 1,000 registered
members and 3,000 other letters have arrived over the past four
weeks that she hasn't had time to open.
   ``Since we made the decision to represent ourselves, the
reception has been tremendous, as much among the young as the old,''
she said.
   For the past four years, affairs of the elderly have been
included in the platform of the environmentalist Greens, and Mrs.
Unruh has served as a member of the federal Bundestag parliament
under the Greens umbrella.
   But the Greens refused to guarantee senior citizens a fixed share
of their parliamentary seats as it has set a 50 percent quota for
women representatives, so the Gray Panther faction broke off from
the leftists in early July.
   ``We tried to negotiate this with the Greens for 10 months and
got nowhere,'' the 64-year-old party leader said. ``We no longer
have confidence that our interests are represented by the
established parties.''
   The Grays are still a fledgling party and will require months of
organizational work and campaigning before gaining a voice in West
German state affairs, Mrs. Unruh acknowledged. But she said the
party would run candidates in the December 1990 national elections
and expected to get at least the 5 percent of the vote needed to be
seated in parliament.
   A recent public opinion poll commissioned by Stern magazine
showed the Grays with 6.5 percent of the vote. That would be more
than enough to earn it a small voice in federal affairs and the
possible role of kingmaker in determining the fortunes of the two
biggest parties.
   Smaller parties like the Grays, the Greens, the liberal Free
Democrats, symbolized by yellow, and the ultra-rightist Republicans
founded earlier this year have been drawing voters from Kohl's
conservative Christian Democratic Union and the left-leaning Social
Democratic Party (SPD).
   Neither of the leading parties has more than 40 percent of the
vote, so both the CDU and the out-of-power SPD are considering
various alignments with smaller parties to win at least 50 percent
of the vote next year.
   Berlin's 2 million residents have been governed since March by a
coalition of environmentalists and Social Democrats, signified by
red. Many expect a national red-green coalition to be offered to
voters next year, or a ``stoplight'' coalition that would also
include the Free Democrats.
   Mrs. Unruh said her party could not be easily cast into a left-or
right-wing category, but acknowledged that many members support the
SPD leader Hans-Jochen Vogel and that the Grays might add their
color to that rainbow.
   The Grays do not plan to run their own candidate for chancellor,
she said.
   Mrs. Unruh said her party in no way supports the anti-foreigner
sentiments gaining ground in West Germany, but that older citizens
are worried about the burden the new arrivals are placing on a
social security system already threatened by a declining pool of
younger wage earners.
   ``These calls of `Foreigners Out' are absolute rubbish,'' she
said, ``But neither should foreigners and refugees have rights and
privileges that exceed those of other citizens.''
   East German refugees and ethnic Germans arriving from other East
European countries qualify for immediate public assistance, while
pensions and benefits for West Germans are based on their working
years and contributions.
   ``These are the kind of issues we must address,'' Mrs. Unruh
said, ``and we want the older generation to have an influence.''

<HEAD>Downtown `Hotel' Pays Guests To Take Part In Experiments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT W. TROTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pat Phillipps is staying in downtown Boston for a
few months, in a room with a view of the theatre district. At her
disposal are a swimming pool, library and exercise room, and she
gets three meals a day.
   Rather than pay room and board, Phillipps will get about $2,100.
But then, most tourists aren't called back if they don't clean their
plate.
   Phillipps, 68, and about 11 other people are housed not at the
Sheraton or the Meridien, but a Tufts University laboratory.
``You've got a private room, private bath, and you don't have to
make up your bed if you don't want to,'' she said. ``Of course, I
make up mine.''
   Tufts' Nutrition Research Center on Aging, funded by the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, runs experiments and studies with
volunteers, mainly older people. For $50 to $3,000, depending on the
study, subjects are fed and monitored.
   The center, in an effort to slow the aging process through diet
and nutrition, studies ways to impede the decay of the human body by
osteoporosis, arteriosclerosis, cataracts, and overall loss of
physical capacity.
   ``There are life-threatening situations as people age,
debilitating situations,'' said Judy Frazier, metabolic research
unit manager and director of nursing. ``There really has to be a
better way.''
   The studies can last from two months to five years, including
follow-up experiments. The center, since its inception in 1983, has
completed 76 studies, is working on 18, and has seven ready to go.
   The main focus, naturally, is on diet, and meals are monitored
rigorously. Portions are carefully weighed and measured so the staff
knows exactly how much protein, cholestrol, body fat and other
elements the subjects are eating.
   ``We look at food as chemicals,'' said research dietician Nadine
Sahyoun. ``We are really a lab, not a kitchen.''
   Some studies require two identical meals, one that ends up poured
into a blender to be mixed together and inspected for overall
content.
   If a subject doesn't eat everything the study calls for, even a
dab of gravy left on the plate, the ``rinse and scrape'' method is
implemented. The plate is squirted with a bit of water, and the
volunteer scrapes the plate with a spatula to ensure that every last
bit of food is consumed. If a volunteer is found to have dropped a
pound or two, his or her meals are enlarged.
   Most of the participants, aside from the money, like to
contribute to the center's research and come from all over the
country.
   ``It's a great organization, great people,'' said Richard Harris,
a retiree from El Paso, Texas. ``That makes it more pleasant than
anything.''
   Harris, who participated in a vitamin B-6 study last fall and was
this year for a follow-up, said he would receive $3,000.
   The center offers guided boat tours, museum outings and other
diversions, and the nearby theaters provide entertainment.
Chaperones used to keep the volunteers from sneaking over to
Chinatown for a plate of sweet and sour pork, but most subjects
welcome the chance to find out if they've been eating right.
   Of course, there are other reasons. Phillipps, whose Walpole home
doesn't have air conditioning, likes to take part in summer
experiments so she can get some knitting done without her hands
getting sweaty.

<TEXT>
   At least 10 million adult Americans suffer
from loss of bladder control, including 15 percent to 30 percent of
older people who live in the community and at least half the 1.5
million residents of nursing homes.
   Contrary to what many people think, most incontinence _ in active
older people as well as nursing home residents _ can be cured or
improved. Treatments include drugs, surgery, and behavioral
therapies such as bladder training.
   Incredible as it may seem at a time when almost no health
condition is taboo, most older Americans afflicted with urinary
incontinence have never told anyone, not even their doctors.
Instead, they buy adult diapers and absorbent products to manage
their ``secret'' condition, assuming it incurable.
   Incontinence often causes shame and embarrassment about personal
appearance and odor. Incontinent people isolate themselves from
family and friends. They restrict their activities outside the home
and limit social interactions. In many cases, they become housebound
_ prisoners in their own home.
   Well-meaning but uninformed relatives may assume wrongly that
nursing home care is the only option available for a family member
with incontinence. Even more regrettable, few nursing home residents
who were incontinent beforehand or who developed the condition after
admission _ have any type of diagnostic evaluation, not to mention
treatment, or cure.
   Although researchers know a great deal about incontinence, the
number of people who are not treated successfully remains
surprisingly high. Many people still believe it is due to aging.
Age-related changes in the urinary tract make older people likelier
to develop incontinence but normal aging isn't the cause.
   The most common forms of adult urinary incontinence _ which
afflicts twice as many women as men _ are stress, urge and overflow.
Leakage of urine during exercise, coughing, sneezing, laughing, or
other movements that put pressure on the bladder is stress
incontinence. People who sense a need to void but cannot hold urine
long enough to reach a toilet have urge incontinence. Overflow
incontinence occurs when small amounts of urine leak from a
constantly filled bladder.
   Many cases of urinary incontinence are a mixture of more than one
type. Older people who can control their urine but cannot reach a
toilet because of arthritis or another crippling disability have
``functional'' incontinence.
   Often, incontinence results from a combination of many factors,
including nerve damage, restricted mobility, illness, confusion and
medications. In some cases, it is temporary and can be cured by
changing medications or by treating an acute illness such as a
urinary tract infection. However, many cases are chronic, lasting
indefinitely unless properly diagnosed and treated.
   The diagnosis of urinary incontinence includes a complete medical
history, careful physical examination and bladder tests. Patients
record in a ``voiding diary'' each episode of incontinence, what
they were doing at the time and the amount of wetness. The doctor
also evaluates a person's mental health, ability to perform
activities such as bathing and dressing, and living arrangements,
and asks about any associated illnesses, operations and current
medications.
   Most people with incontinence can be helped. For example, they
can learn to control bladder and pelvic muscles through behavioral
therapies like exercises, biofeedback and bladder training.
Beneficial drugs include bladder relaxants, bladder outlet
stimulants and estrogens. Surgery can support the bladder, increase
capacity, implant a device to control the flow of urine or create a
sling to support and compress an open urethra. Some patients may
require a combination of treatments. As a general rule, the least
invasive or least dangerous procedures should be tried first.
   Even when permanent improvement isn't possible, frequent
reminders to ask for help going to the toilet and an increase in the
number of trips may reduce incontinence. This technique can be
especially useful in nursing home residents with incontinence. Other
helpful changes include restricting liquids before bedtime,
providing easier access to toilet facilities, and if necessary using
absorbent products or a catheter, a thin tube inserted to drain
urine.
   The fact that therapies are often effective makes it particularly
tragic that so many people with incontinence do not seek treatment.
It is not a normal part of aging, and people with this burdensome
condition can be helped.

   Even the simplest gardening tasks _ like
sowing seeds _ may become formidable as you grow old. But help is
available, from special tools to expert advice, to keep your thumb
green.
   Many gardeners devise their own ways to cope with, or avoid, the
pain of pushing, pulling, handling, stooping, squatting and kneeling.
   As digital dexterity waned, I found tweezers indispensable to
pick up tiny seeds and plant them just where I want them. And at
least one company (Harris Seeds of Rochester, N.Y.) markets pelleted
seeds encased in a white coating that makes them easier to see as
well as handle.
   Some devices are expensive, but others require only ingenuity and
make-do materials. For instance, you can stack three old tires and
fill the hole in the middle with soil to make a planter just high
enough for easy tending from a wheelchair.
   Gardening indoors under fluorescent lights gives you many of the
benefits and few of the inconveniences, or the expense, of a
greenhouse. You can start with a small two-tube unit and go as far
as you want. Fluorescent stands of all sizes are available at garden
centers and hardware stores, or you can make your own. My wife and I
share a custom-made one along a wall of our dining room. She does
flowers and I grow salad greens in the winter and start plants for
summer.
   Raised-bed and container gardening also make chores easier. Craig
Hospital of Englewood, Colo., has put out a booklet on raised-bed
techniques, which, as the name implies, essentially involve planting
above ground level.
   A similar pamphlet was published by the Horticulture Department
of Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va. And the
American Horticultural Therapy Association of Gaithersburg, Md., is
a fruitful source of information for many aspects of gardening for
the handicapped and elderly.
   A few years ago, the National Gardening Association, of
Burlington, Vt., put out a booklet called ``Tools and Techniques for
Easier Gardening.'' This is unfortunately out of print, but may
still be available through libraries.
   Divided into sections on soil preparation, planting, weeding,
cultivating, watering and harvesting, it lists scores of special
tools and companies that marketed them. It also abounds with
homespun suggestions from many sources.
   Helen Ashworth of Heuvelton, N.Y., for example, said a chair with
boards attached to the legs so it wouldn't sink into the ground
enabled her mother to hoe while sitting and thus continue gardening
much longer than she expected.
   Eleanor Patterson of San Francisco suggested using barbecue tongs
to pull weeds, transplant small plants or remove dead leaves from
hard-to-reach areas.
   You can buy kneeling pads, make your own from a piece of foam
rubber, or just use old cushions. Lightweight combination
kneeler-sitters are available, easy to reverse and to grab onto to
lower and lift yourself. Grips attached to the handles of shovels,
hoes, spading forks or rakes reduce bending or arm strain. Hoes
turned upside down become canes.
   Indoors, there are planter pulleys enabling you to lower and lift
hanging plants and lock them into any position for watering or other
tasks.
   If you regularly turn the soil of your vegetable garden, power
tillers as light as 17 pounds make the chore easier. They come with
various attachments, including lawn thatchers. But keeping a garden
fertile by mulching with leaves, grass clippings and other
composting material eliminates much toil involving heavy equipment.
   Perennials also may reduce the volume of work, especially in
decorative gardening, but a couple vegetables also come in this
class. Asparagus beds may last 50 years and more; rhubarb also
repeats year after year with practically no care. My modest
asparagus patch, 20 years old, provided more than 700 spears this
year in a harvest period lasting two months. All I do is lay down a
mulch of salt hay to keep down weeds and fertilize once a year.
   Among plants that need sowing annually, squashes offer
long-lasting harvests, as do broccoli, pole beans and tomatoes of
indeterminate varieties. Some lettuces are cut-and-come-again types.
Ditto for New Zealand spinach and Swiss chard.
   But the biggest help and encouragement for gardeners comes from
the plants themselves. They want to live and grow. And they don't
care whether you use tweezers to plant seeds or featherweight hoes
to zap weeds.

<HEAD>Illinois Laws Protect Elderly, Restore Tax Exemption</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bills restoring a $1,000 income-tax
exemption to the disabled and elderly and strengthening protections
for senior citizens have been signed into law by Gov. James R.
Thompson.
   The tax measure, which will be worth $30 per taxpaer beginning in
the 1990 tax year, restores an exemption erased by federal tax
reform. Until 1987, both state and federal law allowed blind and
elderly taxpayers to claim an extra personal exemption on their
income taxes. Elimination of that tax break on the federal level
also erased it for Illinois taxpayers, since state income tax
calculations are based on the federal tax return.
   Other bills will establish an ombudsman in the state Department
on Aging as an advocate for nursing home residents; extend
eligibility of some low-income elderly for a program that pays for
heart and diabetes drugs; and create felony offenses for neglect or
financial exploitation of an elderly or disabled person to aid
prosecutors in punishing con artists who prey on the elderly.

than 100 hotels on May 5, 1990. There is no fee for the recruiting
employers or the senior citizens.
   ``Senior Power 1989 was an unprecedented success,'' Days Inns
President Michael A. Leven said in a statement. The company created
the job fairs as a way to involve its franchised hotels in hiring
older workers.
   Days Inns said almost all of the 634 employers at the fairs were
in the service industry. They included Kelly Services, Wendy's, K
mart Corp., Sears Roebuck &amp; Co. and McDonald's; local employers
included banks, schools, retail outlets, museums, libraries,
restaurants, hotels and hospitals.
   Days Inns said it has found older workers to be more reliable,
more loyal and more productive than many of their younger
counterparts. Where turnover in the hotel industry averages 105
percent a year, Days Inns has seen a decrease, and turnover among
the older workers is less than 1 percent.
   In addition, it said, tardiness and absenteeism are virtually
nonexistent and health insurance costs have not increased.

<HEAD>Project Tests if Southern Pines Can Grow in Israeli Desert</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Southern pines can make it there, they'll make
it anywhere, say the architects of an experiment to grow hybrid
trees in the Negev Desert of Israel.
   Using seeds for ``super pines'' developed in the Southeast by
Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific Corp., scientists are waiting to see
if such trees will thrive in the dry, unfriendly climate of the
desert in a project they say could boost the fight against world
hunger and global warming.
   If the trees, to be helped along with irrigation, take root in
the desert climate, there will be potential for advancing the
capability to grow food in other non-productive regions of the
world, said Stuart Paskow, spokesman for the Jewish National Fund,
which conducts agricultural research in Israel.
   ``If it works, we can go into the Third World,'' he said from New
York. ``The ultimate answer to hunger is to put the source of food
where the people are.''
   Trees are essential to advancing agriculture in arid environments
because they stabilize the land by slowing erosion, Paskow said. The
so-called super pine, or loblolly pine, developed by Georgia-Pacific
in Georgia and South Carolina through the cross-pollination of
several species, matures more rapidly than ordinary pines.
   Georgia-Pacific donated three pounds of seedlings, enough for
about 100,000 trees, to the Jewish National Fund three months ago.
Other than making sure the seedlings get water, the experiment at
this point is pretty much a waiting game, Paskow said.
   ``The main thing is, if they germinate then we're in business,''
he said. ``It should be about a year.''
   By employing a ``drip irrigation'' system that distributes the
scarce water according to plants' needs, the Negev has been able to
support some other plantings, Paskow said.
   The Negev is Israel's driest region, and without irrigation the
pines wouldn't stand a chance, said Walter Jark, corporate director
of forest resources for Georgia-Pacific.
   ``If you overcome the dryness, they ought to do quite well,'' he
said.
   Jark noted there are few sure things in nature.
   ``The main obstacle we know about is the water. But this is a
test _ we might find other obstacles.''
   Jark said the super pines have never been tested in areas with as
little rainfall as the Negev. However, except for the dryness, the
mild climate in Israel is not much different than that of the
southeastern United States, he said.
   Researchers say a successful pine planting in the Negev also
would bode well for efforts to combat the global warming phenomenon,
or greenhouse effect, by providing more trees to absorb carbon
dioxide and release oxygen, Paskow said. Carbon dioxide, which traps
solar heat, is one of the factors attributed by scientists to the
global warming.

<TEXT>
   J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., the nation's oldest venture
capital firm, says it has completed its cash tender offer for Prime
Computer Inc.
   Whitney said Sunday its DR Acquisition Corp. accepted for payment
49,520,864 shares of Prime common stock at $20 cash each. The offer
expired at midnight Friday.
   The shares represent about 79 percent of Prime's outstanding
shares on a fully diluted basis. Whitney intends to exchange notes
with a face value of $22 per share for the remainder of Prime's
shares. Analysts expect the notes to trade at a substantial discount
from face value.
   In June, Whitney agreed to buy Prime, which has posted losses the
past three quarters, in a friendly merger valued at about $1.25
billion. But earlier this month the deal was amended to lower the
purchase price to about $1.1 billion after Whitney said it had
trouble obtaining financing for the original offer.
   Prime, a minicomputer maker based in suburban Natick, had been
searching for a ``white knight,'' or friendly suitor, to ward off a
$1.13 billion hostile bid from MAI Basic Four of Tustin, Calif.
   The merger will mean the largest single investment ever for
Whitney, a private New York firm founded in 1946 by industrialist
John Hay Whitney.

<HEAD>Boat Manufacturers Try to Stay Afloat as Sales Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two large boat manufacturers are trying to stay
afloat after sinking sales hurt quarterly earnings and forced one
company to send pink slips to 20 percent of its work force.
   Brunswick Corp., the nation's largest recreational boat
manufacturer, based in Skokie, Ill., last month laid off 4,000
employees because of declining sales.
   Also last month, Brunswick reported a 75 percent plunge in
second-quarter earnings from $68.3 million, or 78 cents a share, in
the same quarter a year earlier.
   Outboard Marine Corp., based in Waukegan, 40 miles north of
Chicago, reported fiscal third-quarter net income of $6.8 million, a
76 percent drop from the same period last year.
   Boating industry officials can't pin down exactly what happened,
although they have some theories.
   Rainy weather in the East, the industry's largest market, a late
spring in the Midwest and cooler weather in the South are partly
responsible for the slump, said William McManaman, Brunswick's vice
president for finance.
   A 14 percent interest rate on boat loans also may have kept away
potential buyers, he said. Fear of a recession also may be a factor.
   ``Consumers aren't spending on big ticket items such as cars,
boats and real estate because of economic uncertainty,'' said Greg
Proteau, a spokesman for the National Marine Manufacturers
Association, a Chicago-based trade organization that represents 400
boat builders.
   There had been indications that 1989 would be a banner year.
There was record attendance at boat shows in January, February and
March. High consumer demand at dealerships followed the shows.
   ``A lot of people shopped, but few bought,'' said Gordy Smith, a
boat dealer at Waukegan Marine Co. ``Dreamers filled the showroom.''
   He said his sales dropped 50 percent in June and July.
   Outboard, the nation's third-largest boat manufacturer, has 10
subsidiaries, including Lowe, Chris Craft, Sunbird and Sea Nymph.
The company also makes Johnson and Evinrude outboard motors and
Cobra stern drive engines.
   Recently it laid off nearly 300 workers because of the sales
slump.
   Sydney Heller, a boating industry analyst for Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. in New York, predicts 1989 boat sales will drop 15
percent to 20 percent from last year.
   Boyd Poston, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons in St. Louis,
said the industry is catching its breath after going full throttle
for six years.
   ``Boating is in a cyclical pullback like in the past,'' he said.
``Once it stops resting, it will go back up.''

<HEAD>Navistar Reveals Prototype for Smokeless Engine</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Trucks equipped with Navistar's new ``smokeless''
diesel engine will leave cleaner air in their wake instead of the
characteristic black smoke of their predecessors, officials of the
truck-maker say.
   ``This is a diesel for the 21st century. This prototype model
already meets the toughest 1994 state and federal pollution
standards for diesel,'' said Vice President John Horne of
Chicago-based Navistar International Corp.
   The International '94 Smokeless Diesel also significantly reduces
emissions of major pollutants, company officials said Friday.
   Trucks equipped with the engine probably will not reach the
market until 1994 due to testing and fuel requirements, the company
said.
   Diesel engines commonly are favored by commercial operators
because they give better fuel economy, require less maintenance,
last longer and produce fewer pollutants than gasoline engines.
   A major drawback is the smoke they emit, federal regulators say.
   The smokeless diesel's development comes at a time when car and
truck makers around the world are working to meet new state and
federal emission guidelines.
   By 1994, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will require
that all diesel makers reduce particle emissions by 90 percent from
1985 standards, and cut carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide levels.
   Navistar's new engine will solve the problem by using a new type
of catalytic converter to reduce the amount of minute particles
released to the environment, Navistar officials said.
   The development of low-sulfur fuel also will prevent decay of the
converter, said officials of the company, the nation's leading
producer of medium- and heavy-duty trucks.
   Emission-control requirements will be so stringent by 1994 that
manufacturers will virtually have to produce a smokeless engine,
said Navistar spokesman Bill Greenhill.
   Officials of Ford Motor Co., the second leading manufacturer of
trucks, said they haven't announced plans for meeting the standards,
but expect to follow similar techniques.
   ``I would expect that we would do the same kinds of things
they're doing,'' said Ford spokesman John Emmert from Detroit. ``I
know we're all in the same boat and we're all going to have to meet
those standards.''
   A fleet of trucks equipped with 94 of Navistar's new engines will
begin open-road testing next year in Southern California, and the
company plans to begin widespread circulation of the engine in 1994,
Horne said in a news release.
   He said trucks with the new engine would not reach the market
until then because federal law requires that the catalytic converter
be tested for 150,000 miles.
   ``The other major reason is that the low-sulfur fuel needed to
allow the use of catalytic converters will not be widely available
until Oct. 1, 1993,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Dire forecasts of summer gas lines and higher
prices aren't materializing, and analysts say prices at the pump may
be headed even lower as the vacation season draws to a close.
   Although consumers are paying about 15 cents a gallon more this
summer than last, nearly all the increases came in the two months
following the Exxon Valdez oil spill last March. Since June, retail
prices in most areas have slipped slightly.
   On June 13 the consumer group Buyers Up, a division of the Ralph
Nader-founded Public Citizen organization, issued a report saying
tight supplies and rising demand would lead to higher prices and
possibly 1970s-style gas lines by early August.
   Christopher Dyson, author of the report, said then that he
expected prices to jump about 10 cents a gallon during the summer,
mainly because of a supply squeeze.
   In fact there have been no reported shortages of gasoline, even
in remote areas with heavy tourist traffic, according to Joseph
Koach, executive director of the Service Stations Dealers of
America. He noted that many industry groups, as well as the Bush
administration, had disputed Buyers Up's prediction.
   ``They've got to have egg on their faces,'' Koach said.
   Dyson, in an interview last week, acknowledged his report was off
the mark, but he said the nation still faced a precarious supply
situation and that a refinery or pipeline accident could throw the
retail gasoline market into crisis.
   Some other analysts in June agreed with Dyson's view that a
supply crunch was possible, but none went so far as to predict
motorists would face backups at the gas pump.
   Dyson said he had ``totally underestimated'' the refining
industry's ability to sustain an exceptionally high rate of
production throughout the season.
   ``That was the major reason our prediction didn't come out as it
should have,'' Dyson said. He also did not expect the high rates of
summer oil production by major foreign producers that pushed down
prices for crude used to make gasoline.
   U.S. refineries have run nearly full blast this summer, using an
average 89.8 percent of available capacity in June and 90.3 percent
in July. The July figure was the highest for any month in 11 years,
according to the American Petroleum Institute.
   The risk of shortages also was eased by a lack of growth in
gasoline use. The Energy Department said demand in the first half of
this year was unchanged from a year earlier, although it says growth
will resume soon. Last spring it had predicted about a 1 percent
increase for this year's first half.
   Summer usually is the peak period for gasoline consumption, and
demand normally tails off by September.
   Jan Lundberg, a private energy forecaster based in
Fredericksburg, Va., said the recent slump in gasoline prices ``is
clearly due to an unexpectedly weak summer driving season'' that he
said could mean the economy is entering a recession.
   Lundberg and other analysts say prices are likely to continue
dropping this fall, although the pace and depth of decline will be
determined in part by the willingness of wholesalers and station
dealers to pass on savings from lower crude prices.
   The Energy Department says it expects the average price of
imported crude oil by summer's end to be about $17 a barrel, or
about 10 percent lower than last spring. Theoretically that would
mean a decline of about a nickel a gallon at the pump, although many
factors, including state taxes, could change that.
   The department said in a recent report that 12 states have raised
gas taxes this year.
   Marion Stewart, an energy analyst at the private National
Economic Research Associates Inc., said in an interview that he
expects retail gasoline prices to fall ``at least a few cents a
gallon'' in the next several weeks.

<HEAD>BAT Profit Up 21 Percent, Issues Defense Document Against Hoylake
Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC today reported a 21 percent gain
in its six-month earnings and sharply attacked financier James
Goldsmith's $21 billion hostile bid for the British conglomerate.
   BAT issued a response to a letter Goldsmith sent Sunday to BAT
Chairman Patrick Sheehy. Goldsmith had requested a meeting to
negotiate the terms of his all-securities bid, which values BAT at
13.4 billion pounds.
   A BAT spokesman said the company has no interest in talking with
Goldsmith or his partners, British banker Jacob Rothschild and
Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, who have formed Hoylake
Investment Ltd. to try to take over BAT.
   The takeover of the British conglomerate would be the world's
second largest, after the $24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco
Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co.
   Hoylake has argued that BAT shareholders would get far better
value if BAT's assets were ``unbundled.'' Hoylake has said it would
sell BAT's non-tobacco businesses, which include financial services,
retailing and paper.
   In his letter, Goldsmith said all aspects of the Hoylake offer
were open to negotiation, a possible indication the group was
willing to offer some cash.
   BAT stock was up 6 pence at 819 pence a share at midmorning on
London's Stock Exchange.
   The conglomerate said its earnings in the six months ending June
30 totaled 489 million pounds, or 32.07 pence per share, compared
with 404 million pounds, or 26.74 pence, in the same period a year
ago.
   Sales rose 23 percent to 10 billion pounds from 8.13 billion
pounds.
   BAT does not release quarterly results. It is not required to
under British law.
   The company's financial services segment turned in the best
performance. Operating profit surged to 398 million pounds from 177
million pounds.
   BAT's results included a first-time contribution from Farmers
Insurance Group Inc., the Los Angeles-based insurance company the
conglomerate acquired last year for $5.2 billion.
   BAT said its tobacco business performed well, contributing 404
million pounds to operating profit, compared with 361 million pounds
a year ago.
   The company's tobacco brands include Kent and Kool. It also owns
the Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field's stores.
   BAT termed the Hoylake bid highly unattractive, saying it
consisted of a package of securities of ``dubious value.'' It
asserted that even Hoylake admitted it ``may be impossible to sell''
the debt instruments it is offering for BAT stock.
   The company said Hoylake's proposal to acquire BAT rests on a
``bewildering array of interlocking companies, most of whom are
resident in tax havens. Its vastly complex structure is designed to
add an enormous amount of money to the already substantial fortunes
of Goldsmith, Rothschild and Packer at the expense of the
shareholders of BAT.''

   In Manhattan, where even the air is for sale,
developers are wheeling and dealing to keep building higher and
denser on an island that isn't getting any bigger.
   Donald Trump wants to use the rights he owns to land under the
Hudson River to create the world's tallest building. Across town,
the owner of the air space above Grand Central Terminal has been
battling for more than 11 years to convert it to glass, steel, and
cash on the ground.
   ``It's a logical extension of the cleverness of New York City
developers' lawyers,'' says Steve Robinson, co-chairman of
Westpride, a community organization fighting excessive development.
``They push the limits, they invent new mechanisms, they try
anything that may have a shot at working, because there are so many
dollars at stake.''
   Dozens of office and apartment buildings are going up in New
York's midtown area alone, especially around Times Square.
   Under the city's complex zoning laws, the sale of air rights has
become commonplace. It works this way: An investor owns, say, a
five-story building in an area where 10-story buildings are allowed.
He or she ``sells'' the unused air space to a neighbor, who then
gets the right to build a 15-story building. With air rights
purchases and other maneuvers, such as offering to build public
plazas or low-cost housing in exchange for waiver of size
restrictions, developers have managed to put up bigger buildings
than the zoning law would otherwise allow. But such actions have
raised cries of foul.
   ``On street corners all over Manhattan ... you have
disproportionately large buildings going up,'' said Sandor E. Katz
of the Women's City Club of New York, a civic organization. ``There
needs to be some absolute limit on the amount of additional floor
area that can be imposed on any one lot.''
   Civic groups are focusing on Trump City, the billionaire
developer's massive West Side project. Katz calls it ``the most
dramatic single example of the kind of monstrous result you can get
by the accumulation of development rights.''
   Westpride targeted it from early on.
   ``If we are able to have an impact on what Trump proposes, then
other developers in the city would begin to get the signal,'' says
Robinson.
   On 76 acres of old railroad yards along the Hudson River between
59th and 72nd streets, the largest undeveloped land parcel in the
city, Trump City would include a 150-story structure and 13 other
buildings ranging from 13 to 60 floors. Besides offices, hotel space
and apartments, there would be an 800,000-square-foot shopping mall.
   Westpride says the 7,600 housing units would heavily overburden
the neighborhood's schools and sewers, and that the tower, the
world's tallest, would cast a shadow across the Hudson River and
Central Park. Trump's people say there are plenty of sewers and
schools, and that the shadow would not be that obtrusive in a city
full of skyscrapers.
   Trump wants to transfer to his shoreline property the development
rights he owns to 19 acres under the Hudson River, a holdover from
the days when waterfront industry extended onto the piers.
   William Valletta, counsel to the Department of City Planning,
said that the city's zoning law allows a lot's overall size _
including underwater rights _ to be the basis for determining the
size limits of a building. Zoning reformers want to get rid of that
provision.
   Trump hopes to start building in mid-1990.
   On the East Side, developers are hoping to use the air rights
created by the space above the Grand Central commuter train terminal
to build the city's fourth-largest skyscraper nearby.
   In 1978, the Supreme Court backed the city in blocking Grand
Central's owner, the Penn Central Corp., from building a 53-story
office tower atop the landmark train station.
   But the court said it might reconsider if Penn Central found it
couldn't use the leftover development rights on the station site or
get compensation by transferring them, according to a Penn Central
attorney.
   In 1983, Penn Central contracted to sell up to 1.5 million square
feet of air rights to 383 Madison Associates, which wants to use
about half of the rights for a 74-story building at its address
several blocks away.
   The zoning law allows such transfers from a landmark to an
adjacent lot. Penn Central owns the underground land, used for train
tracks, between the terminal and 383 Madison, and it and the
developers hope the rights to this land will qualify the properties
as adjacent, thus facilitating the transfer.
   The local community board rejected the 383 Madison Ave. proposal
in June, but it could be overturned by the city Planning Commission,
which is voting on the plan this week.

   The stock market drifted lower today in a quiet
late-summer session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.88 to 2,682.09
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 388 up, 470 down and
546 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 16.82 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates declined moderately in the credit markets this
morning. Prices of long-term government bonds rose about $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, lowering their yields to the 8.10 percent-8.16
percent range.
   But analysts said many traders remained skeptical that rates were
headed much lower in the immediate future.
   The Federal Reserve is generally believed to be holding off on
any further moves to relax its credit policy until it can see more
evidence that inflation has been successfully restrained.
   The Dow Jones industrial average remains within striking distance
of the closing high of 2,722.42 it reached two years ago this week.
However, brokers note that it has been stalled in that area for the

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of working oil and gas rigs in the
country rose by 45 to total 903 last week, Baker Hughes Inc.
reported.
   The steep increase partly was due to areas drying out from the
heavy rains brought on by Hurricane Chantal several weeks ago, said
Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations and economist
for Baker Hughes.
   The increase, however, was somewhat anticipated, he said.
   ``All the surveys done said there would be more drilling in the
second half of the year. I wouldn't be surprised if we didn't have a
steady increase for the remainder of the year.''
   In Texas, which accounted for more than half of the total rig
increase, the drilling activity was focused the east and north
central portions of the state, Kerridge said.
   A year ago, the count totaled 937, Baker Hughes said Monday.
   The company's rig count _ the widely watched industry index of
drilling activity _ reflects the number of rigs actively exploring
for oil as of last Friday, not the number of rigs actively producing
oil.
   Houston-based Hughes Tool Co., an oil toolmaker company that
merged with Baker International Corp. of Orange, Calif., has kept
track of the rig count since 1940.
   In December 1981, at the height of the oil boom, the rig count
reached a peak of 4,500. But oil prices plunged to less than $10 per
42-gallon barrel in the summer of 1986, prompting a collapse in the
rig count that bottomed out at 663 _ the lowest since Hughes began
compiling figures.
   Among major oil producing states, Texas had the biggest gain with
27 followed by Ohio, six; Kansas and Wyoming, three each; California
and Pennsylvania, two each; and Michigan, one.
   North Dakota posted a loss of two and Colorado and Louisiana lost
one each. New Mexico and Oklahoma saw no change from last week.

   Striking telephone workers in California and
Nevada returned to work today following a tentative three-year
contract agreement offering modest pay increases and health-care
cost controls.
   ``Our members are comfortable with this contract and they're
feeling very good about what they've won, what they feel they fought
very hard for,'' said Jessie Wilson, president of Local 9415 of the
Communications Workers of America.
   Most of the 42,500 telephone operators, repair people and factory
workers for Pacific Bell and the Nevada Bell Telephone Co. were back
on the job or already scheduled for their next shift, Pacific Bell
spokesman Richard Fitzmaurice said today.
   Meanwhile, the strike at Bell Atlantic, which covers six
mid-Atlantic states and Washington, D.C., moved a step closer to
agreement Sunday when the company's Pennsylvania subsidiary settled
with one of two striking unions.
   Strikes continued at NYNEX, serving New York and the Northeast;
and at Ameritech, which covers five Midwestern states. No talks were
scheduled in those two strikes.
   The three continuing strikes involve more than 150,000 workers.
   On Sunday, workers at Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell Telephone Co.,
subsidiaries of Pacific Telesis, began relieving 17,000 supervisors
who took over day-to-day operations following the walkout 16 days
ago.
   As at the other strikebound companies, managers had been working
12 hours a day six days a week to maintain service for PacTel's 13.2
million customers. There were minor delays in operator-assisted
calls, installations and repairs.
   After several marathon sessions, a draft of the tentative pact
was drawn up early Sunday and formalized later by negotiators.
   Workers won increases in wages, bonuses and other payments that
will raise overall salaries by 11 percent over three years, Wilson
said.
   Pay currently ranges from about $228 a week for some operators to
$650 for some skilled technicians, according to union figures.
   The proposed contract would grant wage increases of 3.1 percent
for the first year, 3.7 percent the next and 2.6 percent for the
final year.
   PacTel also won agreement to set up a network of doctors and
hospitals to provide health care for employees. Workers would pay
$10 for most visits while receiving free preventive care. Employees
would have to pay more if they seek treatment from doctors and
hospitals outside the network.
   Company efforts to get employees to share part of their soaring
health-care costs have been a major factor in several of the strikes.
   The contract also contains a no-layoff clause and provides added
family benefits, such as a $2,000 reimbursement for adoption costs
and tax benefits for dependent care.
   The contract must be approved by the membership, but a
ratification vote isn't expected to be completed until Sept. 22,
said Lynn Jimenez, a spokeswoman for Pacific Bell.
   Company officials complained there had been 450 ``serious acts of
sabotage or vandalism'' during the walkout. They said rewards of
$10,000 to $25,000 for information leading to an arrest and
conviction remain in effect.
   In Philadelphia, representatives of the International Brotherhood
of Electrical Workers reached a tentative agreement Sunday with Bell
of Pennsylvania.
   The subsidiary announced the settlement was similar to a deal
reached Thursday between the CWA and Bell Atlantic.
   But IBEW workers will stay off the job until Bell of Pennsylvania
settles local issues with the CWA and an agreement is reached
between the IBEW and sister company New Jersey Bell, officials said.
   ``It's a step forward, but we're not really going anywhere,''
said Chuck Schalch, a Bell of Pennsylvania spokesman. ``We're hoping
the CWA isn't far behind.''
   Bell of Pennsylvania's tentative deal with the 1,900 IBEW members
calls for a 7.5 percent pay increase over three years, a
profit-sharing plan that could provide workers as much as $600 a
year, and a new health-care arrangement intended to hold down costs,
the company said.

   Wang Laboratories, Inc., said today it had
successfully restructured its credit agreements with bank lenders,
gained an additional $100 million in borrowing power and would make
the debt payments it suspended last week.
   In announcing the agreement, the company said it now had a total
$575 million in outstanding indebtedness. It also said its
agreements with lender banks would enable it to raise $175 million
in working capital, with additional assets pledged as collateral.
   ``The company believes that this debt restructuring, together
with the completion of the $175 million of additional secured
financings, will provide the company with the financing required to
meet its business plan,'' An Wang, founder and chief executive
officer of the company, said in a brief statement.
   Wang began renegotiating its lending agreements with banks after
earlier this month announcing it had lost more than $300 million in
the latest quarter.
   Frederic Wang, Wang's eldest son, has stepped aside as president
of the company.
   Wang said the company continues to explore sale of certain
portions of the business, including domestic and international
leasing subsidiaries.

<HEAD>Ueberroth in Group Buying Hawaiian Airlines Parent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An investment group that includes former baseball
commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth is buying the financially struggling
parent of Hawaiian Airlines, company officials said.
   HAL Inc. said Sunday its board of directors unanimously accepted
a tender offer of $22 a share from the group headed by J. Thomas
Talbot, a former airline executive from California. The group plans
to obtain at least 51 percent of the company's stock, making its
offer worth around $22 million.
   HAL stock, boosted in recent months by takeover rumors, has been
trading far above the $22 offered by the Talbot group, closing at
$31.62{ a share Friday on the American Stock Exchange. The shares
were trading at the same level this morning after a temporary halt.
   Earlier this month, rumors circulated that Delta Air Lines was
interested in acquiring HAL, to ward off a takeover itself and to
gain access to Hawaiian Airlines' South Pacific and Japanese routes.
The rumors were denied by HAL.
   But HAL sustained a loss of $13 million in the first half of this
year and has lost a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.
   ``I thought the other (stock) price was probably an inflated
one,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``I think maybe this brings
it down to earth a little bit.''
   Last spring, Ueberroth and Talbot headed a group which made a
$464 million bid for strikebound Eastern Airlines in partnership
with its three unions. But the takeover agreement between Ueberroth
and Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.,
later fell apart over the unions' demand that Lorenzo be removed
from daily control of the airline.
   The group buying HAL also includes Ueberroth's brother John.
   John Magoon Jr., HAL's chairman and chief executive officer, owns
56.9 percent of the company's 1.9 million outstanding shares of
common stock.
   Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest interisland airline, also
serves Los Angeles; San Francisco; Seattle; Anchorage, Alaska; Las
Vegas, Nev.; Australia; New Zealand and other South Pacific points.
   The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers in 1988.
   The tender offer is subject to a number of conditions, including
a satisfactory agreement with the company's unions, financing and
receipt of the required approvals from government agencies, HAL said.

   Teen-agers Beth Young and Nate Deslandes
have no desire to spend their lives baling hay and milking cows, but
they didn't mind spending the last two months in a program intended
to give them farm experience while giving farmers a hand.
   ``We've had some problems, but we had some really nice success
stories too, and we had some farms having some good experiences,''
said Greg Voorheis, who runs the Farm Youth Corps, a pilot program
for the state Department of Employment and Training.
   The corps matched people aged 16 to 21 from northern Vermont with
farm jobs. The goal was to alleviate a labor shortage while the
young people gained experience and money for a summer's work.
   Farmers around the Northeast have especially had trouble hiring
help since wages at hamburger joints have risen to $6 or $7 an hour.
Few farmers can offer more than $4 an hour for harder work, longer
days and fewer benefits.
   ``One of my friends said he knew a kid who said, `I don't touch a
bale for less than $7 an hour,''' said John Lincoln of Westfield.
   The Farm Youth Corps took care of the problem of finding young
people who were willing to work for less money. A combination of
state and federal funds, plus some volunteers, provided training.
   The farmers pay their hired hands $4 an hour, and state funds
will pay the youths a $1-an-hour bonus at the end of the summer.
   The idea for the corps came out of a survey of Vermont's 2,500
dairy farms. More than one-third of the 700 respondents said a lack
of employees kept them from expanding. Nearly two-thirds said they
would consider hiring young Vermonters for the summer if the state
would help find them.
   Young, 17, hooked up with Jim Jones, a Craftsbury farmer.
   ``I like being outdoors and I've been around a farm,'' said
Young, who rides her bike two and a half miles to Jones' farm each
day. ``I like the animals. I think I like milking _ it's nice after
working hard in the woods all day _ and just joking with Jim or
whatever.''
   The experience helped confirm that she'd rather not farm for a
living.
   ``It's a lot of hard work and it's stressful,'' she said. ``But I
think (the corps) is a good idea because farmers need help, and I
think kids are a lot more willing to work than people think.''
   Most kids. Voorheis said eight of the 20 youths dropped out of
the program.
   Young's supervisor, Danny Paquin, said one girl dropped out
because she couldn't stand the thought of sending cows and calves to
slaughter.
   And some couldn't handle a tractor. ``One farmer tried to teach
one of the kids, and he was almost run over himself,'' Paquin said.
   Paquin also had a problem with a young woman who refused to eat
from her employer's table.
   ``Her family background _ these people just eat out of cans.
We're talking Chef Boyardee and Franco American. She wouldn't eat
fresh vegetables,'' Paquin said.
   Before going out to the field, 16-year-old Deslandes and the
others spent a week in classes at a state technical college, where
they learned crop and livestock management, milking techniques and
tractor safety.
   ``He didn't want to go at first. He didn't think he'd need it,''
Lincoln said of Deslandes. ``Now he wants to go back and do more.''
   ``It gives me a lot of experience in mechanics and carpentry and
different kinds of trades,'' said Deslandes, of Westfield, whose
buddies are spending the summer babysitting or working in stores.
   He also learned about growing up.
   ``Responsibility. There's a lot of trust, I think, that goes into
it,'' he said. ``I trust him, he trusts me. I think the
responsibility's the number one thing. It makes you work a lot
harder on goals.''

   Share prices fell slightly Monday on the London
Stock Exchange, as conflicting factors affecting the market canceled
each other out.
   The market was buoyed by selective buying interest on a range of
stocks, traders said.
   However, an early round of selling, combined with a weak opening
on Wall Street, served to upset the market's upward move.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed 0.4
points, or 0.02 percent, lower at 2,374.7, down from a session high
of 2,383.8. The market posted a session low of 2,368.1.
   Volume totaled 349.7 million shares, down from 378.4 million
traded on Friday.
   ``There is a stalemate between buyers and sellers at the
moment,'' one trader said. ``The market's looking for fresh
inspiration to move decisively one way or the other.''
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 10 points at
1,969.0. The Financial Times 500-share index slipped 0.83 point to
close at 1,333.57.
   At the London close, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was
down 15.17 points at 2,672.80 in New York.

<HEAD>World Bank Cuts off Loans to Afghanistan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World Bank loans to Afghanistan have been cut
off because the government has paid nothing on its old debts for six
months, bank spokesman Peter Riddleberger said Monday.
   He said the action taken by the bank's staff was reported last
week to the board of executive directors. The board's 22 members
represent the countries that own the bank.
   Afghanistan's Communist government, with help from the Soviet
Union, is battling a strong guerrilla movement helped by the United
States. It has fallen behind in its payments on $79.2 million of
debts to the bank. The bank's rules require the cut-off when the
arrears pile up for six months.
   As one of the world's poorest countries, Afghanistan borrowed
from the World Bank group's International Development Association
(IDA). The loans were made at less than 1 percent interest a year,
with as long as 50 years to repay. Money for such loans comes from
direct contributions by more than 30 donor countries, with the
largest contribution made by the United States.
   Afghanistan is the first country to be cut off from this fund.
   The World Bank group, the largest source of aid loans to the
Third World, lends larger amounts to somewhat more prosperous
countries through its International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD). The IBRD is owned by 151 governments, including
borrowers. The United States holds the largest block of shares.
   This money comes largely from the proceeds of bonds that the bank
has floated on world markets, and which it lends out again at rates
closer to those charged by commercial banks. Many borrowing
countries cannot get loans from commercial banks, however, and the
IBRD gives borrowers much longer periods to repay than such banks
will accept.
   Nine countries have been cut off from these loans because they
have piled up arrears for six months or more: Honduras, Guyana,
Liberia, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Sierra Leone, Syria and Zambia.
   Together, they owe the bank more than $3.19 billion. Sheldon
Rappaport, another bank spokesman, pointed out that this amounts to
only 4.1 percent of the $77.9 billion that IBRD has in outstanding
loans.

   Grain futures prices were mostly lower, but
soybean prices were sharply higher, following a dramatic turnaround
Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders credited heavy professional buying, reportedly led by
Refco Inc. and Rosenthal-Collins in lots of 2 million bushels each,
with sparking the turnaround.
   Soybean futures drifted lower at the opening bell after a series
of storms over the weekend brightened prospects for the crop. After
prices held stronger than expected, though, buyers stepped in and
began the upward move.
   Also supporting prices were expectations that a U.S. Department
of Agriculture report due out after the close of trading will show
that the condition of crops in the field has declined in recent days.
   At the close of trading, wheat was { cent to 3} cents lower, with

<HEAD>BAT Chairman Rebuffs Goldsmith Invitation to Negotiate Terms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By COTTEN TIMBERLAKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   BAT Industries PLC Chairman Patrick Sheehy on
Monday rebuffed financier Sir James Goldsmith's offer to negotiate
the terms of his hostile $21 billion bid for the British
conglomerate.
   Sheehy also unveiled his company's defensive strategy, aimed at
convincing shareholders they will profit more by holding on to their
BAT stock than by tendering it to Hoylake Investments Ltd., the
investor group led by Goldsmith.
   Underscoring that argument, BAT announced Monday its earnings for
the quarter ended June 30 rose nearly 22 percent.
   ``The defensive plank is on the performance of the businesses,''
BAT Deputy Chairman Brian Garraway said as his company released a
statement known as a defense document.
   The document stated that, ``Since 1980, BAT Industries has
delivered long term superior total returns to shareholders.'' It
also emphasized the strengths of BAT's businesses, which include
tobacco, financial services, retailing and paper.
   Hoylake, which also includes British merchant banker Jacob
Rothschild and Australian entrepreneur Kerry Packer, responded that
the document sidestepped issues such as the failure of BAT's tobacco
interests, strategic blunders in its retailing diversification and
fundamental flaws in its conglomerate structure.
   A takeover of BAT would be the world's second-largest, after the
$24.53 billion acquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts &amp; Co. earlier this year.
   On Sunday, Goldsmith wrote Sheehy, inviting ``you and your
colleagues to sit down and negotiate with us an offer, all aspects
of which are open to negotiation.''
   The approach could be an indication that the bidding group is
willing to offer some cash.
   However, Sheehy said Monday cash would not sway him. He said he
was refusing to meet with Goldsmith because, ``His objectives are
totally different to ours. He wants to destroy the company.''
   Hoylake has that if its offer succeeded, it would sell off all of
BAT's non-tobacco businesses. It has argued that BAT shareholders
would get far better value if BAT's assets were ``unbundled.''
   ``There's going to be no meeting of minds,'' Sheehy said. ``If
you start with two polarized objectives then there's no point in
meeting.''
   Sheehy called Goldsmith's offer to buy BAT for securities worth
13.4 billion pounds unattractive and opportunistic.
   In its earnings report, BAT said its net income for the quarter
ended June 30 totaled 297 million pounds, or $466 million, up from
244 million pounds, or $383 million a year earlier.
   Sales rose 26 percent to 5.25 billion pounds, or $8.2 billion,
from 4.2 billion pounds, or $6.6 billion.
   BAT said it earned 489 million pounds, or $768 million, in the
six months ended June 30, compared with 404 million pounds, or $634
million, in the same period a year ago.
   Sales for the period rose to 10 billion pounds, or $15.7 billion,
from 8.13 billion pounds $12.7 billion.
   BAT is using what is sometimes called a ``just say no'' defense
against Goldsmith. Securities analysts said they expected BAT had
other ammunition besides its earnings record but would save it for
possible use against a sweetened bid.
   ``They're (BAT) keeping their powder dry for later on in the
bid,'' said a London securities analyst who requested anonymity.
   The securities analyst said, ``BAT itself is going to remain
under a lot of pressure to unlock value to shareholders.''
   There had been speculation that BAT might respond by breaking
itself up, perhaps by separating its four main businesses and
creating a new stock for each.
   This idea, reportedly put forward by some BAT institutional
shareholders, would get around the problem of BAT's relatively
slow-growing tobacco business pulling down its share price.
   Sheehy noted Monday that BAT has sold off underperforming
businesses in the past and that ``it's a continuing process. We
haven't called a halt to it.''
   He said he had met with some of BAT's institutional shareholders.
``They have indicated to us that they would not like the shares to
fall, after all this is over, back to the undervalued situation of
before,'' he said.
   BAT is hoping that regulatory authorities will block the Hoylake
bid. U.S. insurance regulators are studying the offer because BAT
owns Farmers Insurance Group Inc. of Los Angeles.
   In addition, 200 U.S. congressmen oppose the bid. ``We are
encouraged by that,'' Sheehy said.

<HEAD>Wang Announces Debt Restructuring, An Wang Says Company Has Money
It Needs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOWELL, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wang Laboratories Inc. announced Monday it
had successfully restructured its credit agreement with banks and
will make loan repayments it suspended last week.
   Wang said its bank lenders had agreed to raise the computer
maker's line of credit by $100 million, to a total of $575 million.
In exchange, the previously unsecured line of credit will be secured
by the entire company's assets excluding inventory, which puts the
banks in line behind the bondholders in case of a liquidation.
   The deal also delays the payback for a $125 million portion of
the credit line that was to become due on Sept. 30. Payments for
that loan will begin on July 15, 1990.
   Wang is hoping to raise $175 million for working capital by
selling assets such as a factory in Scotland, its credit and leasing
subsidiary, and possibly its headquarters, which it would then lease
back.
   The agreement with the banks requires that any money raised
beyond that $175 million go toward paying off its fiscal 1990 bank
obligations, ahead of time if possible.
   ``The company believes that this debt restructuring, together
with the completion of the $175 million of additional secured
financings, will provide the company with the financing required to
meet its business plan,'' An Wang, founder and chief executive
officer of the company, said in a brief statement.
   Wang began renegotiating its lending agreements with banks after
posting record losses of $424 million in fiscal 1989, which ended
June 30. The company also announced earlier this month that
Frederick Wang, Wang's eldest son, was stepping aside as president
of the company.
   Wang said the company continues to explore sale of certain
portions of the business, including domestic and international
leasing subsidiaries. He also said the search for a new president
``is proceeding rapidly.''
   Wang Labs startled investors last week when it suspended payments
on some $209 million in debt while negotiating for new credit terms.
   Wang fell into technical default on its credit agreements on June
30 after it posted a record $424 million annual loss.
   Wang and its lenders _ led by Bank of Boston _ signed the new
credit agreement after a weekend of intensive bargaining.

   Stock prices tumbled in a sluggish late-summer
session Monday amid uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 40.97 points to
2,647.00, for its biggest one-day loss since it dropped 46.47 points
on June 29.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
382 up, 1,178 down and 418 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 136.80 million
shares, down from 145.81 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 165.79 million shares.
   Interest rates fell in early trading in the credit markets, but
then reversed course and headed higher as the day progressed.
   Analysts said many traders remained skeptical that rates were
likely to go lower in the immediate future.
   The Federal Reserve is generally believed to be holding off on
any further moves to relax its credit policy until it can see more
evidence that inflation has been successfully restrained.
   The Dow Jones industrial average began the day within striking
distance of the closing high of 2,722.42 it reached two years ago
this week. However, brokers noted that it had been stalled in that
area for the past several sessions.
   When stocks showed no sign of making a new run at that peak in
early activity Monday, sellers took control.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric dropped 1{ to
56{; International Business Machines 2[ to 113; Exxon { to 43\;
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph 1\ to 38\, and USX | to 33|.
   An exception to the downtrend was Dow Chemical, which gained \ to
100 and traded as high as 101|. The company said it had no news to
report that would account for the advance.
   Georgia Gulf fell 3 to 51{. The company said it adopted new
measures to strengthen its takeover defenses.
   Lyphomed jumped 7} to 30\ as the most active issue in the
over-the-counter market. The company said Fujisawa Pharmaceutical,
which owns about 30 percent of its stock, proposed to acquire the
rest for $31 a share.
   Deltona, traded on the NYSE, climbed 1] to 5}. The company, which
had earlier rejected a takeover proposal from Sycamore Acquisitions
Corp., said Sycamore made a new offer valued at about $7.01 a share.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $43.62 billion, or 1.29
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 2.67 to 189.97.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 6.29 to 389.55, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index was down 5.36 at 340.67.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 3.64 to 458.33. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 376.58, down 2.60.

   The dollar ended mixed Monday against key foreign
currencies in thin, lackluster trading.
   Gold prices rose slightly. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery closed 30 cents higher at $368.40
a troy ounce. Republic National Bank of New York quoted a late bid
for gold at $366.35 an ounce, up 35 cents from late Friday.
   Currency dealers said that in the absence of any new economic
data, the dollar drifted in a narrow trading range dominated mostly
by internal market forces.
   The dollar had risen sharply last Thursday following the release
of a better-than-expected U.S. trade report for July, but ended the
week lower as dealers cashed in on the rally.
   Trading was described as thin Monday, with many dealers out on
vacation.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.17 Japanese yen to close at 143.35 yen. It was
quoted at a lower rate of 142.80 yen in London, and at 143.05 yen in
New York, up from 142.60 yen late Friday.
   The dollar fell against the British pound in London and New York.
It cost $1.5745 to buy one pound in London, more expensive than
$1.5655 late Friday. Sterling fetched $1.5720 in New York, up from
$1.5659.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday,
included: 1.9570 West German marks, up from 1.9562; 1.6862 Swiss
francs, up from 1.6855; 6.5980 French francs, up from 6.5965; 1.1746
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1778; and 1,400.50 Italian lire, down
from 1,405.75.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Friday, included:
1.9520 West German marks, down from 1.9555; 1.6810 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6860; 6.5805 French francs, down from 6.5945; 2.2070
Dutch guilders, down from 2.2080; 1.1744 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1787; and 1,403.00 Italian lire, down from 1,405.75.
   Gold closed in London at a late bid price of $366.50 an ounce,
down from $366.65 late Friday. In Zurich, Switzerland, gold fell to
$366.00 an ounce from $366.75.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell 22 cents to close at $366.79 an
ounce.
   Silver prices declined. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery slipped to $5.227 a troy ounce from $5.238 Friday.
Silver fell in London to $5.24 an ounce from $5.25 Friday.

   Oil futures prices rose in quiet trading Monday
mainly on technical factors.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil,
climbed 28 cents to finish at $19.08 per 42-gallon barrel.
   Energy analysts said the September contract got a slight boost
from last-minute buying before the contract expires on Tuesday.
Contracts for later delivery rose between 14 cents and 21 cents.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded regular
gasoline for September delivery closed 0.09 cent higher at 52.82
cents a gallon. Domestic heating oil for delivery in September rose
0.86 cent to 51.89 cents a gallon. Other contract months also posted
gains.
   Traders said declining U.S. production has helped keep prices
firm despite a global surplus of crude oil and sluggish demand.
   ``The market can support these prices because domestic production
is going down,'' said Linda Simard, energy broker at Drexel Burnham
Lambert.
   The market is awaiting new production data by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries and beyond that to the next scheduled
meeting of the oil group's monitoring committee on Sept. 23, Ms.
Simard said.

<HEAD>Cocoa Prices Plunge on Surplus Supplies, Disagreement Over Price
Support</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LITKE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices plunged to life-of-contract lows Monday
following indications that two major producers would no longer back
current price-support levels.
   On other markets, soybeans weathered early pressure and made a
dramatic turnaround on heavy professional buying and copper finished
higher.
   Cocoa prices slipped as low as $69 before settling $46 to $57
lower on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the
contract for delivery at $1,108 a metric ton.
   Computer-programmed selling greased the slide, but traders found
no shortage of bad news Monday.
   The world's leading cocoa producer, Ivory Coast, suggested the
price-support level set by the International Cocoa Organization may
be nearly 10 percent too high. Malaysia, the fourth-leading producer
and considered by many a crucial player in any ICCO pact, reiterated
it would not join the organization until it sorts out ``domestic
problems.''
   ``The market was very demoralized. It's clear there's much cocoa
already out there, and the 1989-90 crop is in very good shape,''
said Arthur Stevenson, who tracks cocoa for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., New York. ``And matters could be further
complicated if there is continued disagreement over what price can
be defended.''
   Grain futures mostly were lower but soybean prices were sharply
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   Traders credited heavy professional buying, led by Refco Inc. and
Rosenthal-Collins in lots of 2 million bushels each, with sparking
the turnaround in soybeans.
   Soybean prices drifted downward at the opening after weekend rain
brightened prospects for the crop. But after prices held firmer than
expected, buyers stepped in and began the upward move.
   ``People who sold the market on the weekend rains might have been
surprised,'' said Vic Lespinasse, a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., Chicago. ``But we're headed back for more traditional August
weather and the crops are going to need more than the rain in the
forecast today and tomorrow.''
   Wheat was \ cent to 3} cents lower, with the contract for
delivery in September at $3.90\ a bushel; corn was { cent lower to \
cent higher, with September at $2.34} a bushel; oats were unchanged
to 1 cent higher, with September at $1.38} a bushel; and soybeans
were 4 cents to 12\ cents higher, with August at $6.28 a bushel.
   Copper resumed its recent rally Monday, following Friday's
interruption of a runup that had covered seven consecutive sessions.
The rally had been linked to production problems, among them ongoing
strikes by miners in Canada and Peru and many analysts attributed
Friday's brief decline the result of profit-taking.
   On Monday, prices were supported partly by reports that Mexico
had closed a state-run mining operation because of bankruptcy. Some
analysts suggested the government tried to pre-empt miners there
from going on strike.
   Copper settled .65 cent to 1.55 cents higher on the Comex, with
August at 125.45 cents a pound.
   Precious metals didn't fare as well. Gold was 30 cents to 70
cents higher, with August at $368.40 a troy ounce; silver was 1.1
cents to 1.2 cents lower, with August at 522.7 cents a troy ounce.
Platinum, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, was $1.60 to
$1.90 higher, with September at $485.40 a troy ounce.
   Livestock and pork futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .52 cent to .75 cent lower, with September at
74.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .45 cent lower,
with August at 84.12 cents a pound; live hogs were .52 cent lower to
unchanged, with October at 40.67 cents a pound; and frozen pork
bellies were .37 cent to 1.45 cents lower, with August at 26.80
cents a pound.
   Petroleum futures were higher on the New York Merc.
   Crude oil climbed 14 cents to 28 cents, with September at $19.08
a barrel; heating oil was .26 cent to .92 cent higher, with
September at 51.89 cents a gallon; and unleaded gasoline was .09
cent to .75 cent higher, with September at 52.82 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>O'Connor Issues Stay of Lucky-Alpha Beta Merger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The $2.5 billion merger of the Lucky and Alpha
Beta supermarket chains in California was blocked Monday by Supreme
Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, apparently at least until early
October.
   O'Connor issued an order halting the merger at the request of
state Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who contends that the
reduced competition would cost California shoppers $400 million a
year.
   The chains, which have a total of 550 stores, were to have
combined their operations under the Lucky banner. An appeals court
order blocking the merger was to have expired Monday, though the
process of consolidation would have taken several months.
   O'Connor's order, which was not accompanied by a written opinion,
forbids the merger until the full Supreme Court decides whether to
grant a hearing on Van de Kamp's appeal.
   The court reconvenes Oct. 2 and is not likely to take up the
issue until then. If the court grants a hearing, an action that
requires votes from four of the nine justices, the stay will be
extended until the court rules in the case, O'Connor said.
   ``This order means that a merger threatening California shoppers
with hundreds of millions of dollars in higher grocery bills will
not take place until the United States Supreme Court can review
it,'' Van de Kamp said in a statement. He said he anticipates court
action in early October.
   Chief Assistant Attorney General Andrea Ordin said O'Connor's
order apparently does not require Van de Kamp to post a $16.3
million bond that a federal judge had earlier required as a
condition of the appeal. Van de Kamp had said he would drop the
appeal if the bond were required.
   ``I feel it does show that we have raised a very significant
issue: whether the remedy of divestiture, keeping the two entities
apart or being permitted to separate the two entities, is
available,'' Ms. Ordin said of O'Connor's order.
   Troy D'Ambrosio, spokesman for American Stores Co., Alpha Beta's
parent, declined comment.
   American Stores bought Lucky in June 1988 and predicted that
increased efficiency from the consolidation would save California
customers $50 million to $60 million a year. Lucky is the state's
largest grocery chain, Alpha Beta the fourth largest.
   The Federal Trade Commission approved the merger. But Van de
Kamp, in a suit claiming violation of federal antitrust law,
contended that the merged chain would dominate the marketplace in
many areas and lead to higher prices.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon of Los Angeles issued a
preliminary injunction last September ordering separate operation of
the chains, finding a likelihood of reduced competition.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said this March that there
was evidence to support Kenyon's finding but overruled his
injunction against the merger, saying it was too late to undo the
merger once the FTC had approved it.
   Kenyon then required Van de Kamp to post a $16.3 million bond in
order to block the merger while appealing to the Supreme Court,
saying the money was needed to cover American Stores' losses from a
delay of the merger.
   Van de Kamp disputed the company's claim of losses and also
argued that he should be exempt from the bond because he was suing
on behalf of the state's consumers.
   The appeals court did not lift the bond requirement, however, in
an order last Thursday that said the merger could proceed Monday.
Van de Kamp appealed to O'Connor, who handles emergency appeals from
9th Circuit rulings, and she intervened Monday before American
Stores could begin final action on the merger.

   Defeated in a high-profile attempt to buy Eastern
Airlines, former baseball commissioner Peter V. Ueberroth has turned
his attention to another financially struggling carrier.
   Ueberroth, whose first job after college was with a small airline
in Hawaii, is part of an investment group that has agreed to buy HAL
Inc., the parent of Hawaiian Airlines. The sports figure has gained
a reputation in professional baseball and the Olympics for turning
problem enterprises into moneymakers.
   HAL said Sunday its board of directors unanimously accepted a
tender offer of $22 a share from the group headed by J. Thomas
Talbot, a former airline executive from California.
   The group, which also includes Ueberroth's brother John, plans to
obtain at least 51 percent of HAL's stock. At $22 a share, the group
could purchase a majority of the company's 1.95 million outstanding
shares of common stock for about $21.9 million.
   HAL stock, boosted in recent months by takeover rumors, plunged
on the American Stock Exchange from its Friday closing of $31.62{ a
share to $25.25 a share Monday.
   ``I thought the other (stock) price was probably an inflated
one,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst with Janney
Montgomery Scott Inc. in Philadelphia. ``I think maybe this brings
it down to earth a little bit.''
   Talbot, reached at a Honolulu hotel, said his group plans to
improve Hawaiian Airlines' service with an infusion of capital in
the form of better planes and equipment.
   ``The company has built up a strong base, first with its 60 years
in the interisland markets and now reaching out to the mainland,''
Talbot said. ``We think the employees who have been here for years
are very strong.''
   Talbot said his group was attracted by Hawaiian's established
routes in the Pacific Basin, which he called a booming air travel
market.
   Talbot said he and Ueberroth, who was on the mainland, would hold
a news conference next week to discuss their plans for the airline.
   HAL denied rumors earlier this month that Delta Air Lines was
interested in acquiring it to ward off a takeover itself and gain
access fo Hawaiian Airlines' South Pacific and Japanese routes.
   HAL sustained a loss of $13 million in the first half of this
year and has lost a total of $30.6 million over the past 2{ years.
   Honolulu stockbroker Randy Havre of J.B. Havre Securities Inc.
said the $22-a-share offer was reasonable for long-term investors
and even was paying shareholders a premium on the stock's value,
which he estimated to be between $15 and $20 a share.
   ``The bottom line is the employees are going to win on this
because they're getting new management which will reduce the
instability caused by financial losses over the past few years,''
Havre said.
   He attributed HAL's consistent losses to the high cost of
maintaining its aging aircraft.
   HAL spokesman Keoni Wagner said he did not know how great a role
Ueberroth would play in the company. There were reports Monday that
he could become co-chairman with John Magoon Jr., HAL's current
chairman and chief executive officer.
   Ueberroth was unavailable for comment Monday on the takeover bid.
   Last spring, Ueberroth and Talbot headed a group which made a
$464 million bid for strikebound Eastern in partnership with its
three unions. The deal later fell apart over the unions' demand that
Frank Lorenzo, chairman of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp., be
removed from daily control of the airline.
   After graduating from San Jose State College in California in
1959, Ueberroth worked for Trans International Airlines in Hawaii as
an operations manager and vice president through 1962.
   HAL completed a deal last year giving a subsidiary of Japan Air
Lines a 20 percent ownership stake and infusing almost $20 million
into Hawaiian Airlines.
   In its June 26 issue, Forbes magazine blasted the airline in an
article entitled ``What's Hawaiian for `Rotten Management?'''
   ``How do you flirt with bankruptcy in a business that is
indispensable during an unprecedented boom?'' the article read.
``You get swell-headed, expand stupidly, manage poorly, neglect
maintenance, delay and cancel flights and then plunge into a ruinous
price war trying to get a market share.''
   The magazine charged that Magoon ``has managed to run the state's
leading carrier almost into the ground.''
   Magoon owns 56.9 percent of HAL's common stock.
   HAL called the Forbes article superficial and subjective.
   Hawaiian Airlines, Hawaii's largest interisland airline, also
serves Los Angeles; San Francisco; Seattle; Anchorage, Alaska; Las
Vegas, Nev.; Australia; New Zealand and other South Pacific points.
   The 60-year-old airline's fleet of 31 planes carried 5.5 million
passengers in 1988.
   The tender offer is subject to a number of conditions, including
a satisfactory agreement with the company's unions, financing and
receipt of the required approvals from government agencies, HAL said.
   Lindsey Pollock, Hawaiian's senior vice president of marketing,
said HAL would call a shareholders meeting for next week for a vote
on the offer.
   Hawaiian's major interisland competitor is Aloha Airlines, which
had no immediate comment on the purchase, according to Aloha
spokeswoman Stephanie Ackerman.
   Hawaiian consistently has ranked among the nation's leaders in
consumer complaints compiled by the Department of Transportation for
problems with overbooking, reservations, ticketing, fares, refunds,
baggage handling and customer service.

   Northwest Airlines has ordered 12
Pratt &amp; Whitney PW4000 series engines to power six Airbus Industrie
A330 twinjets, an order worth about $162 million, Pratt &amp; Whitney
said Monday.
   Last February, Northwest became the first U.S. carrier to
purchase A330s when it ordered 10 of the planes, also powered by
PW4000 engines. The latest order for six additional aircraft brings
to 16 the total number of A330s that Northwest has on firm order.
   Northwest is also equipping its fleet of 10 Boeing 747-400
aircraft with PW4000 engines.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney is a unit of Hartford-based United Technologies

   MAI Basic Four Inc. reported a quarterly
loss Monday of $46.2 million, including nearly $40 million in
unusual charges related to its failed takeover bid for Prime
Computer Inc. and a reorganization.
   The Tustin-based manufacturer of mid-size business computers said
earlier that it expected the loss for the quarter ended June 30,
which contrasted with a profit of $6.8 million, or 45 cents a share,
for the same period last year.
   Revenues for the period, which is the company's fiscal third
quarter, declined 23.4 percent to $86 million from $112.3 million in
the 1988 quarter.
   On Aug. 4, Natick, Mass.-based Prime accepted a buyout offer of
$1.2 billion from J.H. Whitney &amp; Co., a venture capital firm. MAI
Basic Four tried to buy all or part of Prime for nearly nine months.
Recently it offered $525 million for Prime's minicomputer unit.
   MAI, which is controlled by investor Bennett LeBow, attributed
the quarterly revenue decline primarily to lost business and
deferred buying decisions related to the tender offer. MAI put its
cost from the offer at $25 million and said a reorganization
announced subsequently would cost $14.2 million.
   MAI's president and chief executive officer, William Weksel, said
the takeover attempt coincided with a decline in the mid-range
computer business. He predicted a return to profitability by the
first quarter of its fiscal year 1990.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, the company
reported a net loss of $38.3 million compared with net income of
$18.7 million, or $1.25 per share, for the same period last year.
Revenue fell from $302.9 million to $298.4 million for the nine
months.

   The U.S. dollar eased in early trading against the
Japanese yen Tuesday, while stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange
fell moderately.
   The dollar started trading at 142.78 yen, down 0.57 yen from
Monday's close of 143.35 yen. It closed at 143.08 yen in New York
overnight.
   ``It's moving narrowly as many market players are taking a
wait-and-see position'' in anticipation of the U.S. Federal Reserve
Board's open market committee meeting, to be held in Washigton later
Tuesday, said a dealer with the Bank of Tokyo, who spoke anonymously.
   The Fed committee is expected to discuss interest rates and other
economic matters.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues, which gained 77.69 points for a record closing of 35,140.83
Monday, shed 121.19 points, or 0.34 percent, shortly after the
market opened to move to 35,019.64.
   The drop in the Nikkei reflected a 40.97-point decline in the Dow
Jones Stock Average on Monday in New York, dealers said.

<HEAD>Attendants Union Urges UAL To Carefully Weigh Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A top official of the Association of Flight
Attendants on Monday urged UAL Corp., parent of United Airlines, to
weigh carefully the interests of the company and its employees
before it considers selling it.
   ``Corporate raiders and arbitrageurs and others with only
short-term interests in mind are pressing for the board to hastily
choose to auction United Airlines to the highest bidder,'' Patricia
A. Friend, president of the UAL Master Executive Council of the AFA,
wrote to members of the UAL board.
   ``We urge each of you to continue to resist that pressure and to
consider carefully the interests of the airline and all of its
constituencies.''
   In her letter, Ms. Friend also called on Chicago-based UAL to
resume contract negotiations with the attendants union. Talks were
suspended last week.
   Los Angeles financier Marvin Davis has offered to buy UAL, owner
of the nation's second-largest airline, setting off a buying spree
in the company's stock, which soared $97 in two weeks and closed at
$273.75 Monday.
   Last week, Davis sweetened his proposal to $275 a share, or $6.19
billion.
   The company's directors have delayed a decision on his bid, but
confirmed reports they had been contacted by other potential buyers
and that their financial advisers had met with an unspecified
employee group.
   UAL spokesman Rob Doughty said the company would not comment on
Ms. Friend's letter, and he refused to say if the employee group
that financial advisers had met with last week was the United unit
of the Air Line Pilots Association.
   ALPA made a bid to buy the company in 1987. The offer was
rejected by the company's board.

<HEAD>Better Business Bureau Disputes Most Ward Complaints Over Sears'
Ads</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An industry watchdog group said Monday that it
found no grounds for substantiating Montgomery Ward &amp; Co.'s
contention that Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s ``Everyday Low Pricing'' ad
campaign is misleading.
   Ward complained to the Better Business Bureau's National
Advertising Division, or NAD, that the campaign was misleading and
deceptive to consumers. Ward challenged Sears' statement that it had
reduced prices on 50,000 items, complaining that Sears treated each
size and color variation as a separate unit.
   ``Different colors or designs of the same product were counted as
separate if consumers commonly view them as different, for example,
whitewall versus blackwall tires, white shirts versus stripes,'' the
NAD report said. ``The 50,000 count was substantiated.''
   Both retail giants are based in Chicago, and their chief
executives are brothers.
   The Ward complaint, filed April 7, focused only on the first six
weeks of the Sears ad campaign, which was launched March 1.
   Ward Chairman Bernard Brennan said the company is disappointed
with the finding.
   ``The findings speak for themselves,'' a Sears spokesman said.
   In the complaint, Ward also said Sears was actually raising
prices on several items marked as ``lowered in price.''
   The NAD disputed that contention.
   Ward also said that Sears' price-matching policy on ``identical''
items carried in other stores, particularly appliances and
electronics, was misleading.
   Ward also said that in the first weeks of the new pricing format,
Sears refused to match competitors' prices as advertised. Much of
the merchandise carried Sears' own labels and salespeople claimed
items weren't directly comparable to those offered by competitors,
the complaint said.
   The NAD upheld the ads on this issue as well, but requested that
Sears' price-matching policy be examined further to clearly state
which merchandise is identical to competitors' items.
   The group also recommended that a committee be formed, with
members including Sears and Ward personnel, to study whether Sears
should clarify the way it handles price-matching.
   ``NAD agreed customers were provided a sufficient choice of
national brands to ensure the storewide price-matching pledge was
not illusory,'' the report said.
   ``However, NAD expressed concern that customers might remain
uninformed that the price-matching policy applies to derivative
models unless they request advice from a sales associate.''
