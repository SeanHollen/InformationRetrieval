   Tropical Storm Karen moved southwest away from Cuba
on Friday after dumping heavy rain on the island.
   Tropical storm warnings for Cuba were lifted by the National
Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla.
   The storm, moving in a clockwise loop, could make a complete
circle in the Caribbean if it stays together long enough to meet
with a big funnel trough located in the Gulf of Mexico, forecaster
Bob Case said.
   ``That could cause the storm to move to the northeast in a big
circle,'' Case said.
   But, there is a 50-50 chance the storm will dissipate before
then, he said.
   ``We don't see any major dramatic effect on land areas,'' he
said.
   The system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical storm
strength Thursday when its winds hit 39 mph.
   Rainfall reports Thursday from Cuba included more than 14 inches
at Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth, more than seven inches in
Matanzas and nearly five inches in Havana.
   At 10:30 p.m. EST Friday, the center of the storm was located
near latitude 17.8 north, longitude 85.2 west, or about 175 miles
east of Belize. Karen's highest sustained winds were near 40 mph.
   The hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. However,
hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.

<TEXT>
   U.S. Sen. Jeff Bingaman called on
Secretary of State James Baker on Friday to order an investigation
into the abduction and torture of a New Mexico nun in Guatemala
last month.
   Sister Diana Ortiz of Grants, N.M., was abducted Nov. 2 from a
retreat house in Antigua, about 30 miles from Guatemala City, and
released a day later. In his letter to Baker dated Friday,
Bingaman, D-N.M., said Ms. Ortiz was ``subjected to a 24-hour
interrogation that included both physical and sexual abuse.''
   ``There are indications that a man with a North American accent
who finally stepped in to stop the physical abuse may have been
associated with the U.S. Embassy,'' Bingaman's letter said.
   This possibility ``warrants an expeditious but thorough
investigation,'' the letter said, without giving further details.
   A State Department duty officer said nobody would be available
for comment until Saturday.
   In his letter, the senator also enclosed press reports
indicating a man wearing a Guatemalan police uniform participated
in the abduction.
   Sister Ortiz had been a school teacher in rural Huehuetenango
Province prior to her abduction. Her order, the Ursuline Sisters,
has indicated she will not return to Guatemala.

<HEAD>Iowa Puts Voter Registration Forms in Phone Books</HEAD>

   Iowa is distributing voter registration
forms inside each copy of the new telephone book, and officials
hope the process catches on in other states.
   ``In every election, fewer and fewer people vote in America,''
Secretary of State Elaine Baxter said Friday. ``We're making Iowa
the leader in convenient voter registration procedures.''
   Telephone books currently being distributed by US West, the
Denver-based regional phone company, include voter registration
forms at the bottom of one of the instruction pages. The form can
be clipped and mailed in an envelope to the county auditor.
   State income tax booklets that will be sent out at the end of
the year also will include voter registration forms, under
legislation enacted this year.
   Earl Mix, a US West vice president, said Iowa is the first state
in which the forms will be included in telephone books. He
predicted other states would follow suit.
   ``I hope that this becomes a model for the voter registration
process,'' he said.
   US West distributes nearly 2.2 million telephone books in Iowa,
Mix said. There are more than 1.5 million registered voters in
Iowa, and an estimated 500,000 eligible voters who are not
registered, Ms. Baxter said.

<HEAD>Utah Officials Say Japanese Fusion Work Spawning Patent Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japanese researchers have duplicated
recent U.S. ``cold'' fusion experiments and are reaching for the
lead in the emerging technology, one of the scientists who touched
off the furor complained Friday.
   A U.S. Department of Energy panel recently refused to back a
national nuclear fusion program based on discoveries by University
of Utah electrochemist B. Stanley Pons and a British colleague,
Martin Fleischmann.
   Physicists contend the Utah research has been largely
discredited because other experimenters have failed to fully
duplicate Pons' and Fleischmann's results.
   But Pons said Friday that Japan and India are making major
investments in nuclear fusion research and development that could
wrest leadership in the field away from the U.S.
   In March, Pons and Fleischmann said they had achieved room
temperature, or ``cold'' fusion, by immersing in deuterium-rich
heavy water rods of palladium inside electrically charged platinum
coils. The two said the reaction yield heat equivalent to 100 times
the energy needed to produce the reaction.
   ``They've been duplicating our experiments since late March,''
Pons said. ``The Japanese and Indians are doing just what's
obvious. They're doing the research needed to find out if it's
feasible or not, and they're finding it is.''
   A bitter Pons said if the U.S. does lose its lead in nuclear
fusion research, the blame should rest squarely on the shoulders of
the DOE's Energy Research Advisory Board. The board recently
concluded there is no conclusive evidence that Pons and Fleischmann
actually produced fusion.
   ``We've tried to tell the country that research money is the
only way to cover these (developments) properly, and its pretty
obvious that's not going to get done,'' Pons said. ``We certainly
can't match the scope of the work that the Japanese ... are doing.''
   Japanese physicists at Japan's Nagoya University said in the
November issue of the English-language Japanese Journal of Applied
Physics that fusion had occurred spontaneously between two
palladium electrodes in a flask filled with deuterium gas.
   The Japanese said the major difference between their work and
that of Pons and Fleischmann was the use of deuterium gas instead
of heavy water.
   However, Pons he and Fleischmann already have carried out the
same experiment as the Japanese, and have applied for a patent on
the procedure.
   Japanese researchers point out their own experiments yielded a
high level of neutron emissions _ up to 20,000 times the normal
background level. That is one possible indicator of a fusion
reaction.
   Topping that, another group of researchers at Osaka University
this week reported detecting neutron levels 2.5 million times
normal levels in a cold-fusion experiment using platinum electrodes
in heavy water.
   In addition to the Japanese and India, fusion research also
reportedly is under way in China and the Soviet Union.

   Former President Reagan stole the show with
his jokes and his new look at a fund-raiser for the gubernatorial
campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson.
   The guests at the Century Plaza Hotel on Wednesday night were
all abuzz over Reagan's undyed gray hair.
   ``The Prez looks like a Supreme Court justice all of a sudden _
very distinguished,'' said Joyce Valdez, the GOP fund-raiser who
put together the event, which was attended by 700 people and raised
$700,000 for Wilson's campaign. Actors Sylvester Stallone and
Charlton Heston also attended.
   Wilson fell out of favor with Reagan in 1976, when he backed
Gerald R. Ford at the GOP presidential primary. But there were no
hard feelings Wednesday.
   ``Pete's not one for raising taxes,'' Reagan said to the roars
of the crowd, ``unlike the Democrats, who look at your paychecks
the way Colonel Sanders looks at chickens.''

   Judge Joseph Wapner, who has dispensed his
own brand of justice on ``The People's Court'' for nine years, said
the syndicated television show has helped viewers make sense of the
court system.
   The program set off a flurry of small claims cases when it began
airing in 1981. But that was the show's intent, Wapner said Friday
in an address to the eighth biennial Bench-Bar-News Media
conference.
   Before ``The People's Court,'' many people didn't know there was
a small claims court, where to find it or how to use it, he said.
   ``We're trying to educate people. Judges should try to demystify
the judicial system,'' he said.
   Wapner, 69, explains every decision after he rules on a case. He
said the same practice should be followed by most judges.
   ``The litigants are entitled to know why you're deciding the
case the way you are,'' he said. ``Those three steps to the bench
don't make you a god. You're appointed, but not annointed.''
   Wapner, who has been nominated for four Emmys, turned to
electronic justice after retiring from the bench in 1979 after
serving 20 years as a judge in the Municipal and Superior courts of
Los Angeles.

   Actress Jane Fonda and California
Assemblyman Tom Hayden say their split after 16 years of marriage
was amicable.
   They filed separate divorce petitions on Friday after reaching
agreements on financial and property matters. Details weren't
disclosed because of a privacy pact, their attorneys said. The
divorce would be final in six months.
   The couple separated in December 1988; the court papers didn't
give a reason for the split. They will share custody of their
16-year-old son, Troy, their spokesman, Stephen Rivers, said.
   Attorneys said it was unusual for both parties in a divorce case
to file separate petitions. ``They just wanted to make it very
clear that neither side was initiating this,'' said Hayden's
lawyer, Ken Young.
   Miss Fonda, 52, won best actress Oscars for the 1971 film
``Klute'' and in 1978 for ``Coming Home.''

   Prime Minister Michael Manley's wife
Beverley filed for divorce on the grounds that their 17-year
marriage ``has broken down irretrievably.''
   Beverley Lois Manley, 48, the prime minister's fourth wife, said
in documents filed Friday in the Supreme Court that there was no
likelihood of reconciliation between the two, who have been
separated for more than two years.
   In the court petition she requested joint access to the couple's
two children, David, 8, and Natasha, 15, who live with their
father. Manley has three other children from previous marriages.
   Manley's first two marriages ended in divorce and his third wife
died four years before his 1972 marriage to Beverley Lois Anderson,
a former radio and television announcer.
   In February, a landslide electoral victory over former rightist
Prime Minister Edward Seaga brought the 64-year-old leader's
center-left People's National Party back to power. Manley
previously governed from 1972-1980.

   U.S. marshals arrested 23 people, including
activist Jesuit priest Daniel Berrigan, who blocked elevators in a
federal building Friday to protest government support for El
Salvador.
   The arrests followed a confrontation between U.S. Attorney John
Volz and the Rev. Gerald Fagin, head of the Southern Province of
Jesuits. Fagin was not arrested but said he supported the protest.
   ``I'm a Catholic and I'm sympathetic to your cause, but I can't
allow you to break the law,'' Volz told the demonstrators just
before ordering their arrest.
   ``We are upholding our civil disobedience rights,'' said Fagin.
   Prior to being arrested, Berrigan defended the protest to
reporters.
   ``This is a protest salvaging our own humanity,'' he said.
   The protests coincided with the second day of a two-day memorial
held by Jesuit-run Loyola University for six Jesuit priests
murdered recently in El Salvador.
   There was no violence by the 80 or so protesters. Fifteen men
and eight women were handcuffed and arrested later, then were
arraigned on misdemeanor obstruction charges and released without
having to post bail.
   The demonstration at the 13-story building's eight elevators
began about 12:45 p.m., capping a day of prayer, song and protest
joined by numerous Jesuit leaders, nuns and local high school and
college students.
   Among them were students from Loyola University, where Berrigan,
who began his social activism with his brother during the 1960s, is
teaching sociology this semester.
   Protesters blocked access to elevators by sitting in the
doorways, preventing doors from closing. Power to the elevators
appeared to have been shut off shortly after the protest began and
workers in the building headed for the stairs.

<TEXT>
   Chinese students are dismayed at President Bush's
veto of a bill to let them remain here after their visas expire,
saying he seems to be exempting China from the human rights
standards held for other Socialist countries.
   But several students expressed faith in Bush's promise that he
would help those who fear returning to their homeland through other
means.
   Pei Min Xin, a graduate student in government at Harvard
University and a pro-democracy leader, said Friday that Bush caved
into pressure from China, calling the fierce Chinese government
opposition to the bill a ``bluff.''
   ``People like us have come to this country not only to study but
to learn how democracy operates. We have found that this single
case is rather discouraging,'' Pei said. ``When it comes down to a
choice between human rights and geopolitical interests, the leading
democracy did not hesitate to choose the latter.''
   Said Brandeis University student Shen Tong: ``The basic signal
to me from the American government is that the government still
holds different standards about human rights in China and other
countries.''
   Bush on Thursday vetoed the bill, which had been passed without
opposition in Congress. The president said it was unnecesssary in
light of other administrative proposals.
   The bill affects about 40,000 Chinese students and scholars in
the United States. The Chinese government has attacked the bill and
has threatened to cut off all foreign exchange programs with the
United States if it passes.
   Bush said he was directing Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to
take steps to administratively extend visa benefits to Chinese
students.
   In a statement, Bush said the administrative steps will provide
``the same benefits'' and ``accomplish the laudable objectives of
the Congress ... while preserving my ability to manage foreign
relations.''
   Chinese students are particularly concerned about a Chinese
requirement that they return to China for two years before
reapplying after their visas expire. Bush's directions to
Thornburgh include waivers of the two-year requirement.
   Wu'er Kaixi, a prominent Chinese student activist who escaped to
this country after the Chinese crushed demonstrations in and around
Beijing's Tiananmen Square, believed Bush would help students.
   ``Of course we hoped very much to have the bill pass, but we
were also glad and thankful to President Bush that he did, in fact,
try to help Chinese students,'' Wu'er said through a translator.
``I hope Bush will do what he promised.''
   Bush may have been playing a diplomatic game _ supporting the
democracy movement in fact while ostensibly following the wishes of
the Chinese government, said Patrick Maddox, associate director of
Harvard's Fairbank Center for East Asian research and a frequent
vistor to China.
   Maddox said Bush also may be assuming that the bill will be
overridden by Congress, which would give ``a good plug to his
Chinese friends'' while letting the bill take effect.
   Pei said Chinese students are reluctant to seek political asylum
in this country because they eventually wish to return to their
homeland. ``I am a patriot living abroad, waiting to go back to
China,'' he said.
   Pei, who has studied in the United States for five years, said
he has learned his name is on a blacklist of pro-democracy
students. If he returned home now, Pei said, ``I would face at
least life in prison or execution right away.''

<HEAD>Czarist Bonds, Damage by US Troops Are Issues With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Presidents Bush and Gorbachev run out of
issues at their seaborne summit they could try to settle stubborn
disputes about bonds issued under the czar and damage claims
against American troops in the Soviet Union 70 years ago.
   The seemingly arcane bond issue is in fact a serious obstacle to
the Soviet Union's hopes of borrowing money in the United States.
   ``We've got a pile of obstacles that high,'' said Valery
Sorokin, economic counselor at the Soviet embassy, holding his hand
about two feet above a coffee table. Sorokin has compiled a 33-page
summary of problems that slow trade between the two countries.
   Negotiators have worked for over a year on the issue of bonds
that the Soviets repudiated when they took power after the
overthrow of the czar. Sorokin said there has been little progress.
The Soviets have made agreements with Britain and Switzerland to
redeem such bonds held by citizens there for a few cents on the
dollar.
   One Soviet official, speaking anonymously, estimated the bonds'
face value as high as $300 million. They were issued by railroads
and other privately owned business under the czar.
   ``We get letters from Americans every once in a while, asking us
what to do with them,'' Sorokin said in an interview.
   A few dealers have been willing to buy them for small sums.
Collectors have admired the certificates for their elaborate
engraving. They were not considered to have any other value, so
some were destroyed because they were creased or discolored.
   The government that ruled Russia just before the Soviet takeover
in 1917 was allied with the United States against Germany in World
War I. It got $192.6 million worth of loans from the United States.
The Soviets repudiated those loans too and made their own peace
with Germany.
   President Woodrow Wilson sent U.S. troops to Russia in a
combined action with Britain, France and Japan. The Soviet
government under Josef Stalin and his successors diligently kept
the memory of that brief conflict alive, though it has been
forgotten by most Americans.
   ``We have our claims, too,'' Sorokin said.
   With accumulated interest, the wartime loan claim now amounts to
almost $1 billion. As long as it is not settled, a law passed in
1934 bars the Soviets from floating commercial loans in this
country.
   On Thursday, members of Congress asked Bush to make a priority
issue of waiving another obstacle to commerce between the
superpowers, the Jackson-Vanik amendment. That law keeps tariffs
high against Soviet exports because of Soviet restrictions on
emigration, now considerably eased.
   Trade between the two nations faces other restrictions as well.
One U.S. law says no government agency can help the Soviets get
loans of more than $300 million _ not a large sum in world finance.
It makes an exception only for the Commodity Credit Corporation,
which lends to purchasers of U.S. farm products. But because of the
more far-reaching Jackson-Vanik amendment, the Soviets have never
been able to use that exception for their huge purchases of
American grain.
   A 1986 law bans gold imports from South Africa as a sanction
against race segregation laws, and also includes the Soviet Union
in the ban. Those are the world's two biggest producers of gold.
   A spokesman for MTB Banking Corp., which opens an exhibit of
coins in New York next week, said it will show Soviet silver and
palladium coins but no gold ones.
   ``They wouldn't let us bring in any samples,'' said Chris
Ullman, ``not even a collection of historic coins from the
Hermitage Museum in Leningrad.''

   Two Salvadoran officials are questioning
whether an American woman who was arrested in San Salvador after
weapons and explosives were found in the back yard of the home she
rented was willfully helping rebels.
   Ricardo Valdivieso, the Salvadoran undersecretary of foreign
affairs, suggested Friday at a news conference that Jennifer J.
Casolo may be ``a naive person who has been used by'' the leftist
rebels and that ``unfortunately she was found in the house at the
time.''
   Col. Carlos Amando Aviles, a spokesman for the Salvadoran
military, told the same news conference at the National Press Club
that he knows Casolo and ``she is a very nice, honest person that I
consider a good American.''
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Western
Hemisphere subcommittee of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he
was heartened by the statements about Casolo, a Connecticut native.
   ``I am encouraged by these statements, and I hope they reflect a
change in attitude by the Salvadoran authorities that will result
in the swift and favorable resolution of the case against Jennifer
Casolo,'' Dodd said.
   Still, Salvadoran President Alfredo Cristiani indicated in San
Salvador that ``a judicial process'' was called for.
   ``We feel that anybody that breaks the laws in this country, no
matter what nationality they are, should be submitted to the
judicial process,'' Cristiani said at a news conference.
   ``If there is enough proof, and apparently in this case there
is, in order to start a judicial process, one will be started,'' he
said.
   Of former Attorney General Ramsey Clark, who was in El Salvador
to advise Casolo, Cristiani said: ``If he is involved in any way in
the politics of El Salvador then his permit (visa) will be revoked
immediately.''
   Casolo, 28, has maintained she is innocent of any military
connection with the rebels. She works in El Salvador as a
representative of the San Antonio, Texas-based Christian Education
Seminars, providing tours for Americans who come to see and study
the country.
   She was arrested a week ago after Salvadoran officials, acting
on a tip from a captured rebel, dug up the back yard of the house
she had been renting for the past three months and found dynamite
and thousands of rounds of rifle ammunition.
   Friends suggested she was framed by the Salvadoran government,
but the Bush administration took a different view.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Monday, ``This
is hardly a case of a someone having a few things flipped in their
shopping bag on the way home.'' And the Justice Department began
reviewing the case to determine if she broke the U.S. Neutrality
Act.
   Fitzwater took a softer approach Wednesday, saying U.S.
officials were ``monitoring her case closely to assure she is well
treated.''

   Despite the rapid political change in
Eastern Europe and the role Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev is
playing there, six former U.S. defense secretaries are still
skeptical of the permanence of the shift.
   ``I think that we should recognize that although Mr. Gorbachev
is immensely popular in Western Europe and even in the United
States that his popularity, his position in the Soviet Union itself
has weakened dramatically,'' said James Schlesinger, who served
from 1973 to 1975 in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
   Schlesinger said Friday at the Third Annual Report of the
Secretaries of Defense that Gorbachev is walking a fine line that
could tumble him from power if his reforms become too politically
and financially costly.
   ``The Soviet economy is in serious decline. There is a
possibility of a recession within the Soviet Union, and Mr.
Gorbachev's position is precarious. He may or may not survive, and
it probably is in our interest that he survive.''
   The others participating in the forum, Caspar Weinberger, Melvin
Laird, Robert McNamara, Frank Carlucci and Donald Rumsfeld, agreed
that the Soviet reform spirit might not last. The panel discussion
was sponsored by the nonprofit Southern Center for International
Studies in Atlanta.
   Gorbachev and President Bush were in Malta to hold a weekend
summit aboard U.S. and Soviet warships. Bush praised Gorbachev
Friday as ``a dynamic new Soviet leader'' whose policies of
openness and other reforms are advancing the cause of world peace.
   But Weinberger, who served as Ronald Reagan's defense secretary
from 1981 to 1987, warned, ``The Cold War is not over.''
   Weinberger said the Soviet Union can transform soldiers into
farmers _ and back again _ in a matter of days. They can just as
easily change their party leaders, Weinberger said.
   He cited the reversal of what appeared to be democratic reforms
in China when the army cleared Tiananmen Square of demonstrators.
   ``The Soviet Union is quite capable of reversing these things,
like firing into crowds,'' Weinberger said.
   Still, the former defense secretaries agreed that the opening of
the Berlin Wall and relaxed travel in Warsaw Pact nations could
lead to U.S. troop reductions in Europe. And each said the United
States should keep hands off any attempts at reunifying Germany.
   ``We'll be bringing Americans home. And you'll be seeing that by
the end of the year,'' predicted Laird, Richard Nixon's defense
secretary from 1969 to 1973.
   Schlesinger said the changes sweeping Europe are staggering.
   ``The Warsaw Pact threat is quite different. For that reason, we
can spend somewhat less than we have on our readiness posture in
Western Europe. And I stress somewhat less,'' Schlesinger said.

<HEAD>Deadly Virus Found in Three Monkeys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists who began examining the
carcasses of 100 laboratory monkeys imported from the Philippines
by a Virginia firm say they have so far discovered three with the
ebola virus, considered the deadliest virus to humans before AIDS
was discovered.
   Health officials also say they are monitoring the 25 employees
at the Virginia research firm that had received the monkeys in
October even though they believe the disease would have turned up
in the employees by now if any had been infected. Officials said
none of the employees have shown any symptoms.
   The monkeys had been shipped to Hazleton Research Products of
Reston, Va., a subsidiary of Corning Glass Corp. that uses primates
for cosmetics and drug testing.
   This is the first time the virus has been found in a non-human
and the first time it had been found in the United States. The
discovery of the first infected monkey was announced earlier this
week.
   ``We don't know where they got the virus,'' Charles Dasey, a
spokesman at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious
Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md., said Friday.
   ``We're continuing to help Hazleton and public health officials
determine how far it has spread through the monkey colony,'' he
said.
   In mid-November, medical investigators helped Hazleton determine
that some of the monkeys suffered from simian hemorrhagic fever and
that one monkey had the ebola virus. All of the animals in the
shipment were then destroyed, authorities said.
   Since then, 17 monkey carcasses have been sent to Fort Detrick
for necropsies, similar to autopsies in humans. The first seven
arrived Wednesday, and three, including the initial animal, had the
virus.
   Ten more delivered Friday have not been examined, Dasey said. It
was not immediately known when the remaining necropsies would be
performed.
   The ebola virus causes a contagious disease that is transmitted
through body fluids and secretions, though not through casual
contact, according to Dr. Susan Fishel-Hoch of the institute.
   It was first identified in Zaire in 1976, where over 500 people
died.
   The virus kills 50 percent to 90 percent of those it infects.
There is no vaccine.
   Health officials said Friday that Hazleton employees who had
worked with the monkeys had worn surgical masks, gowns and gloves
on the job.
   ``At this point, I don't see where we have a health problem,''
said Barbara Mitchell, spokeswoman for the Virginia Department of
Health in Richmond. ``We probably would have seen something by now
if someone was infected, but we're still taking every precaution we
can.''
   Mitchell said the 25 workers will be examined daily for the next
three weeks in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.

<HEAD>White House Seeking to Tighten Medicare Spending</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The White House budget office wants to trim
about $9.5 billion from projected spending on health and social
programs in fiscal 1991, according to Bush administration budget
documents.
   Most of that would come from shaving $8 billion from what
otherwise would have been spent on the Medicare program next fiscal
year under current law, according to the documents obtained Friday.
   The Department of Health and Human Services _ which includes
Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, the Food and Drug
Administration and the National Institutes of Health _ proposed a
fiscal 1991 spending plan with $8.2 billion in savings.
   Of that total, HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan proposed to trim
$5.1 billion from projected 1991 spending on Medicare, which
finances health care for the nation's 33 million elderly and
disabled.
   The White House Office of Management and Budget, however, wants
to trim $8.1 billion from projected growth in the program, through
reductions in payments to doctors, hospital reimbursement rates and
other payments to hospitals for capital improvements and medical
education.
   An HHS source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
budgets of a number of programs, including Medicare, are the
subject of ``serious discussions'' between White House budget and
department officials.
   Medicare spending is expected to reach $114 billion this year.
   Michael Bromberg, executive director of the Federation of
American Health Systems, which represents private hospitals, called
the proposed cut ``ridiculous'' and said he doubted Congress would
go along.
   ``The economic impact of not having your income keep up with
your uncontrollable cost increases means either reduced quality or
reduced quantity _ either you cut services or the quality is going
to suffer,'' he said.
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, ranking Republican on the House Ways
and Means Committee, is circulating a letter among his House
colleagues saying the nation's rural, inner-city and teaching
hospitals ``simply cannot continue to absorb another year of
significant budget cuts.''
   This year, Congress restored about half of the $5 billion that
Bush had proposed to cut out of Medicare for the fiscal year that
began Oct. 1.
   In the federal-state Medicaid program, which provides health
care for the poor, Sullivan sought to expand eligibility to include
pregnant women and infants up to 150 percent of the poverty level,
up from the current 133 percent.
   The HHS source said the department is reassessing whether states
should be required or just encouraged to expand eligibility.
Governors have complained that expansions of the Medicaid program
are straining their state budgets.

   The government dropped its sedition
and racketeering case against three leading militants of the 1970s
after three years and more than $2 million in trial costs.
   U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said Friday he will not retry the case.
Prosecutors claimed the radicals conspired to overthrow the
government by force through a series of bombings and bank robberies.
   ``Given the amount of effort already expended in the
investigation and prosecution, and the effort that would be needed
for a new trial, I have decided that the best course is not to seek
a retrial,'' he said.
   The federal jury cleared the three of sedition charges with a
partial verdict Monday, then deadlocked on whether alleged bombing
exploits constituted racketeering. A mistrial on the racketeering
charges was declared Wednesday.
   Defendants Raymond Levasseur and Richard Williams will not go
free because they are serving 45-year sentences on convictions in a
New York federal court on some of the bombings.
   But the third defendant, Patricia Levasseur, has been released
from prison after serving 3{ years of a five-year federal term for
harboring a fugitive, her husband Raymond.
   ``I am grateful for my new life,'' Mrs. Levasseur said. ``I
think it was a very reasonable thing that the government is doing
by not retrying this case and I want to thank the jury and the
community that they come from here for having belief in my
innocence.''
   Defense attorneys were delighted.
   ``I'm speechless. After 2{ years or whatever it's been on this
case, it's the right result and I'm a little bit overwhelmed that
the government did the right thing in this case at this juncture,''
said attorney Kenneth King.
   Estimates of the trial costs ranged from $2 million to $10
million, much of it for the crew of U.S. marshals brought in to
maintain security.
   The case began in May 1986 with an indictment against eight
people on charges of seditious conspiracy, racketeering and
racketeering conspiracy. Each count carries a maximum term of 20
years and $20,000 in fines.
   During the course of the case, charges were dropped against two
of the defendants who were already serving long prison terms. Two
others pleaded guilty and charges were dropped against a fifth
person after a judge suppressed evidence seized at her house.
   By the start of trial in January, only three defendants remained.
   Prosecutors claimed the three were members of an underground
group which bombed courthouses and other facilities from 1976 to
1984 in a plot to overthrow the U.S. government. They claimed the
group robbed banks to finance their actions.
   But the defense hailed the jury's rejection of the seditious
conspiracy charges as vindication of their argument that the
indictment in effect was for ``thought crimes'' and should never
have been lodged.
   The government has used the sedition statute only a few times
since it was first invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil
War, according to Arthur D. Wolf, a professor at Western New
England College in Springfield.
   It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during
World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in
an assassination attempt against then President Harry Truman. Last
April, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious
conspiracy charges in Arkansas.

   The Defense Department has ordered an
immediate halt to all production spending on the V-22 Osprey, the
vertical takeoff plane the Marines and members of Congress want but
the administration wants to cancel.
   Deputy Defense Secretary Donald J. Atwood sent instructions
Friday to Navy Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III to ``terminate
forthwith'' all contracts financed out of the previous fiscal
year's $334 million for procurement, said Lt. Cmdr. Gregg Hartung,
a department spokesman.
   Those contracts were for items that take a long time to supply,
the so-called ``long lead'' items.
   Though all $334 million had been obligated, ``much of it remains
unspent,'' said Hartung, reading from Atwood's memo.
   Congress this fiscal year refused the administration's request
to kill the plane, but did limit its appropriation of $255 million
to research and development.
   Though the Marines had placed a high priority on the Osprey to
ferry troops ashore from ships off landing beaches, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney decided that the $27 billion needed for the
desired fleet of aircraft could be better spent elsewhere and
helicopters used for the ferry job.
   Backers of the plane, to built near Fort Worth, Texas, by a
joint endeavor of Boeing Corp. and Bell Helicopter Textron, argued
that it could be enormously useful in easing airspace congestion
around heavily used airports, but critics retorted that if it were
commercially valuable, airlines and manufacturers would finance it
themselves.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Halts Plutonium Production Indefinitely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN K. PAULSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government halted operations at
the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant to resolve safety questions
including whether enough plutonium dust has accumulated in the
pipes to cause an uncontrolled nuclear reaction.
   Energy Secretary James Watkins announced a major management
shakeup at the plant and said it would not reopen until the
government and the plant's new contractor _ EG&amp;G Inc. _ are
satisfied safety concerns have been met.
   At a news conference at the plant, 16 miles north of Denver,
Watkins said plutonium operations had been scaled back 20 percent
and would be shut down altogether in the coming days.
   Watkins acknowledged that any long-term shutdown could seriously
affect the United States' nuclear weapons capability. The plant is
the only one of its kind in the United States that makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons. Other plants in the nuclear weapons
industry that have been at least partly shut down in the last two
years include the Savannah River Site in South Carolina, the
plutonium processing plant at the Hanford Reservation in
Washington, and the Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium
plant in Ohio.
   Rocky Flats has been plagued by safety accusations in recent
years and is the target of a federal criminal probe that so far has
not resulted in indictments. Earlier this fall, DOE terminated its
management agreement with Rockwell International Corp. and signed a
new accord with EG&amp;G, which is scheduled to take over fully Jan. 1.
   After touring the plant, Watkins said, ``Although no major
hardware problems were identified by the Department of Energy team,
conduct of operations, standards of performance, engineering
support and management structure remain deficient.''
   Among the safety concerns he cited was an October report issued
by a team of independent investigators which found weapon-grade
plutonium in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct at
one of the plant's main buildings.
   Initial reports indicated there was enough plutonium present _
about 12 pounds _ to cause ``criticality,'' or a nuclear reaction,
but another study found there was less plutonium in the ducts than
originally thought. Both reports said there was no evidence a
reaction had occurred.
   Watkins said the criticality issue does not pose a public safety
threat.
   ``Nevertheless, because it is an important safety issue, I am
asking EG&amp;G to independently review the report's findings and
produce their own action plan,'' he said.
   Gov. Roy Romer, who was present at Watkins' news conference,
said the decision to shut down plutonium processing at Rocky Flats
shows a new commitment by DOE to safety. He added:
   ``It's obvious that the proof is in the pudding, and it's my job
as governor of Colorado to make sure the citizens are safe.''
   Rep. David Skaggs, D-Colo., who earlier called for a complete
shutdown at Rocky Flats, said Watkins ``seems to be taking a
positive, if somewhat uncertain step, but in the right direction.''
   Skaggs said it was unclear how the shutdown period at Rocky
Flats would be evaluated and verified.
   Watkins admitted that DOE made major mistakes at Rocky Flats.
   ``We did not bring our management into the modern world and
we're going to do that now,'' he said.
   Part of the shutdown period will be dedicated to safety
training, Watkins said. He said it would be necessary to regain
public trust.
   ``Of course we have a credibility problem. What we are trying to
do now is regain it,'' he said.

   A producer at NBC's ``Today'' show says his
deletion of an unfavorable reference to General Electric Co. in a
report on defective aircraft engine bolts had nothing to do with
GE's ownership of the network.
   ``I definitely wasn't more careful because GE was involved,''
executive producer Marty Ryan told The Washington Post in a story
published today.
   The original report said that GE, a manufacturer of aircraft
engines among other things, accepted defective bolts from a
supplier and for eight years did not require that the supplier
certify the product's quality.
   The report, broadcast Thursday on the network's morning show,
mentioned other manufacturers, but only the part pertaining to GE
was cut, the newspaper said. Ryan said ``an expanded spot'' about
the GE allegations will air on the show next week.
   Ryan said he did not think the reporter, Peter Karl of WMAQ-TV
in Chicago, had ``journalistically (covered) all his bases.'' The
Chicago station had prepared and originally aired the report.
   Ryan called the omission ``one of those things.''
   Karl said he had been asked by ``Today'' show producers whether
he had contacted GE for comment on the report. The reporter said he
had done so on several occasions.
   ``My view is that you make a mistake when you treat your
employer differently than anybody else,'' Ron Magers, an anchorman
at WMAQ, was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
   Vishwanath Pratap Singh was sworn in as
prime minister Saturday to replace Rajiv Gandhi, and the new leader
said his first goal would be to bring dignity to India, whose
previous government was dogged by allegations of corruption.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman, who administered the oath of
office at the presidential palace, has given Singh 30 days to prove
his National Front coalition can muster a vote of confidence in the
new Parliament.
   Gandhi, now consigned to the role of opposition leader, smiled
as he approached Singh after the 10-minute ceremony. He was one of
the first to offer congratulations.
   On Friday, Singh also was elected parliamentary leader of the
centrist National Front and of the coalition's largest party, the
Janata Dal.
   Singh's selection came after last-minute conferences, a
fistfight, and allegations of skullduggery within the front, which
is united by little more than antipathy to Gandhi and the Congress
Party.
   It formed a cohesive opposition force to defeat Gandhi in
national elections Nov. 22-26.
   ``My first task is to restore the dignity of the country,''
Singh said Friday. ``We should make an India of which every Indian
will be proud.''
   The 58-year-old former defense minister said foreign policy
would remain largely unaltered and that the government would take
the Congress Party into confidence on ``national issues.''
   The Janata Dal has 141 of the National Front's 144 seats in
Parliament's new policy-making lower house. The other three seats
went to smaller parties in the coalition. Gandhi's party has 192
seats, and its allies have another 17.
   The National Front has also been promised support by the
Bharatiya Janata Party, which has 88 seats, and by a combination of
left-wing groups, which won 51 constituencies.
   That would give the coalition and its tacit allies 283 seats _
enough to carry a vote of confidence in the government.
   Although the Congress Party has more seats than the National
Front, it would have had more trouble forming a coalition.
   Gandhi became prime minister in 1984 after the assassination of
his mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. His aides predicted the
new government will fall apart before its five-year term expires,
clearing the way for new elections and the Congress Party's return
to power. The party governed India for nearly all India's 42 years
of independence.
   The Congress Party said it would not stake a claim to form the
government. Instead, it appeared prepared to wait to see if Singh
could preserve a government with his ideologically diverse allies.
   Coalition members said Thursday that Singh, a former defense
minister, was the only candidate for prime minister. But Singh's
professed reluctance for the job spurred two other candidates,
Chandra Shekhar and Devi Lal, to enter the fray.
   A whirlwind of consultations began Friday as Singh and other
leaders drove from house to house and office to office.
   A few hours before Singh was named prime minister, riot police
quelled fistfights between supporters of Singh and Chandra Shekhar
in the street outside Chandra Shekhar's home.
   Ram Jethmalani, a senior member of the National Front, was
punched and kicked by supporters of Chandra Shekhar when he got out
of his car to begin a hunger strike aimed at persuading Chandra
Shekhar to step aside in favor of Singh.
   The 78-year-old Jethmalani, one of India's top criminal lawyers,
fell to the ground as the two sides traded punches.
   Chandra Shekhar stalked out of the parliamtentary meeting after
Singh was chosen party leader.
   Singh was in Gandhi's Cabinet until 1987, when he resigned amid
reports his investigations into government corruption were proving
embarrassing to the prime minister.
   Shortly afterward, Swedish and Indian newspaper and radio
reports disclosed the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid as
much as $50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a $1.4
billion contract to supply the Indian army with artillery guns.
   Gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing, and the charges have never
been proved, but they raised serious questions about the Gandhi's
integrity and cost him popular support.

   Researchers start clinical trials next month
on a new vitamin A cream that researchers believe will smooth the
small wrinkles from aging, sun-damaged skin, without the irritating
side effects of Retin A.
   Dr. Thomas Nigra, chairman of dermatology at Washington Hospital
Center, said the cream, called Pelretin, has proven in animal tests
to be able to restore wrinkled skin to a youthful look.
   Now, he said Friday, the cream will be tested for six months on
240 patients in three cities to see if it works on humans. The
results should be known in about a year, but it may take up to four
years before Pelretin is approved for prescription use, the
researcher said.
   The clinical tests were organized after Pelretin was tested on
rabbits and the rhino mouse, a rodent that is genetically disposed
to develop wrinkles early in life. The results of the animal tests,
said Nigra, were ``dramatic.''
   Pelretin, said Nigra, is a ``first cousin'' to Retin A, a
prescription cream that was developed to treat acne but which
doctors discovered also is effective against skin wrinkling.
   ``Pelretin should offer an advantage over Retin A because the
early studies suggest it has a similar therapeutic response but
with less side effects,'' he said. ``This is really a second
generation of cosmetic pharmaceutical.''
   The side effects of Retin A include a reddening of the skin,
scaling and flaking, along with a burning sensation, Nigra said.
   The doctor said Pelretin ``has been through all of the studies
... to make sure it is a safe product to be used in human testing.''
   Both Retin A and Pelretin contain a Vitamin A compound that some
researchers claim has been shown in tests to smooth aging, damaged
skin.
   Other dermatologists, however, claim that the creams only give
the appearance of smoothing the skin and that the effects are not
real.
   Nigra said his research with Retin A demonstrates that the
compound does remove some wrinkles, giving what he called
``excellent'' results for 28.5 percent of patients who use the
cream and ``good'' for 47.6 percent.
   But he said about half of the patients who used the placebo also
showed ``good'' results because ``we taught them how to take care
of their skin.''
   Nigra said laboratory tests have shown that vitamin A compounds
do improve skin tone. He said biopsies of skin treated with Retin A
show that it has a hormonal effect that causes skin tissue to
thicken. This, in turn, causes some wrinkles to smooth out.
   Volunteers for the clinical tests are being accepted at the
Washington Hospital Center, and at hospitals in Atlanta and San
Diego. The study is to start Jan. 8.
   Nigra said the patients in the study must be white, between 40
and 70 years of age and have skin that has been moderately to
severely damaged from a lifetime of exposure. Other races will be
tested later, he said, although dark skins tend not to be easily
damaged by the sun.

<HEAD>Perfect Gymnast Lands in U.S.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Nadia Comaneci, who vaulted gracefully into
American hearts as a tiny gymnast performing airy gyrations in the
1976 Olympics, has leaped what remains of the Iron Curtain to come
live in America.
   The 28-year-old Comaneci, who defected from Romania on Tuesday,
flew here Friday on the Pan Am plane ``Liberty Bell'' from Vienna.
   ``I'm very happy because I'm here in America and I wanted from
long time to come here,'' she said in halting English at a news
conference at John F. Kennedy International Airport. ``I wanted to
have a free life.''
   Comaneci contacted a U.S. embassy in Europe on Friday morning
and was quickly granted refugee status, said State Department
deputy spokesman Richard Boucher.
   He added, ``We certainly welcome Ms. Comaneci.''
   Asked how long she had thought about defecting, she replied, ``A
long time. I had it in my mind for a few years.''
   Comaneci has traveled abroad frequently since becoming the first
gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics. She won 21 gold
medals altogether in Olympic and other international meets during
her career, which earned her a life of privilege in a country that
has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of this
decade.
   Her defection Tuesday to Hungary was a blow to the hard-line
government of Romanian President Nicolae Ceausescu, who had named
the gymnast a ``Hero of Socialist Labor'' for her athletic
accomplishments. Comaneci was held up as a role model for Romanian
youth.
   When asked what political impact her defection will have on
Romania, Comaneci replied: ``It's not my business.''
   The refugee status means U.S. officials believe Comaneci has a
well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Romania, where
the government has rejected the reformist tide sweeping other East
European countries.
   Comaneci was accompanied at the news conference by a man who
appeared to be translating reporters' questions for her. She
introduced Konstantin Panit by saying: ``This is my friend who
helped me to come here. I want to thank him.''
   Her former gymnastics coach, Bela Karolyi, left Romania for the
United States in 1981 and had encouraged Comaneci earlier this week
to follow his example.
   ``I knew she was unsatisfied and unhappy about her personal
situation,'' he said. ``I was very happy to know she chose freedom
and decided to make this very difficult step.''
   Karolyi said he suspects she will be bombarded by ``business
propositions.''
   Karolyi coached the then 14-year-old Comaneci during her perfect
performances at the Montreal games.
   Speaking from Europe on Friday, Karolyi said he planned to
return to the United States on Sunday to meet with Comaneci,
possibly in Indianopolis, headquarters of the U.S. Gymnastics
Federation.
   Comaneci would be eligible to apply for permanent resident
status in the United States in one year, U.S. officials who
requested anonymity said.
   Comaneci, accompanied by six other Romanians, crossed the border
into Hungary on Tuesday and went into hiding. She reportedly told a
border guard she was leaving her homeland ``for the sake of
freedom.''

   A federal judge has issued a court order
stripping U.S. citizenship from a former Ohio man accused of
serving as a Nazi SS guard at World War II concentration camps.
   The Justice Department said Friday that the judge's order
stripping Jakob Frank Denzinger, 65, of his U.S. citizenship was
issued last Monday after the man's attorney told the government
Denzinger did not plan to respond to the charges.
   Denzinger, who had been a successful businessman in Akron, fled

   Dozens of AIDS activists who were arrested for
blocking a public roadway in front of the White House say they were
protesting what they call a lack of leadership on the issue by
President Bush.
   Many of the 78 who were arrested Friday are directors and top

money is needed for prevention efforts and health and social
services for victims.
   In all, about 200 protesters gathered in Lafayette Park across

   Speakers at the rally mocked a statement by Bush earlier this

<HEAD>Oak Ridge Tritium Sales Resume</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has concluded that
amounts of a key component of nuclear warheads that had been listed
as missing weren't stolen after all, so the agency is resuming
commercial sale of the material.
   The material, tritium, has been sold for 25 years in small
amounts for research and for making glow-in-the-dark markings, as
for clock faces, exit signs and airport runway markings in remote
areas.
   It is also used to boost the power of nuclear warheads and the
power thermonuclear weapons.
   The department had suspended commercial shipments from the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee earlier this year after
customers complained they had not received all of the material they
had been billed for.
   Friday, the agency said it had found no evidence to support the
possibility that the material had been stolen. Deficiencies in
measurement methods were among the causes of the shipping
discrepancies, the agency said.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Stop Exclusive Programming Rule</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An Oklahoma firm is again asking a federal
appeals court to stop a rule from taking effect in January that
would let local TV stations stop cable TV systems from carrying
some syndicated shows.
   John Cole, who is representing Tulsa, Okla.-based United Video
Inc., said Friday he had petitioned the U.S. Appeals Court for the
District of Columbia to stay the implementation of new syndicated
exclusivity, or syndex, rules.
   Opponents claim the rules will cause massive headaches for cable
operators and reduce the opportunities for viewers to watch some of
their favorite TV shows.
   A three-judge panel of the court in October denied an earlier
request for a stay, and then on Nov. 17 denied the overall
challenge to the rules. Cole said he was seeking a review by the
panel or by the full court on First Amendment grounds.
   The Federal Communications Commission decided to reimpose the
rules in 1988 after an eight-year lapse.

<HEAD>Eds: Chloroquine is CQ</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A malaria drug is being recalled by a New
Jersey company because some of the bottles instead contain an
animal diuretic.
   The recall by Biocraft Laboratories of Elmwood, N.J., applies to
Goldline brand 250 milligram chloroquine phosphate tablets packaged
in 100-tablet bottles labeled as lot number 14311, the Food and
Drug Administration said Friday.
   The recall began after a pharmacist found a bottle containing
the animal diuretic, a drug that steps up production of urine, the
FDA said. No injuries have been reported.
   Bottles containing the wrong drug have been found in California,
Utah, Arizona and Oregon.
   Using tablets from the erroneously labeled bottles would not
protect against or treat malaria, which can be life-threatening,
and large amounts of diuretics can lead to irregular heartbeat, low
blood pressure and general weakness, the agency said.

   Striking telephone workers ratified a contract
negotiated last week after a four-month walkout, and planned to
return to work on Monday.
   ``It's over, it's over, it's over,'' said Bob Master, a
spokesman for the Communications Workers of America. ``We're
happy.''
   Eighty-five percent of union workers approved the contract with
Nynex Corp. The ratification Friday marked the final settlement of
strikes against regional telephone companies that began in August.
The strikes at one point involved 200,000 workers in 20 states.
   The CWA's 40,000 regional members struck Nynex subsidiary New
York Telephone. New England Telephone, another Nynex subsidiary,
was struck by 20,000 members of the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers.
   The IBEW settled first, and its workers returned to work last
month.
   ``We are very pleased,'' Nynex spokesman John Bonomo said, after
the CWA ratification vote. ``The settlement is fair for everyone _
customers, employees and shareholders. We're looking forward to
welcoming all our employees back to work on Monday, and dedicating
ourselves to providing the quality service our customers rely on us
for.''
   The rancorous Nynex walkout left one striker dead after a picket
line confrontation; the company reported hundreds of instances of
sabotage against its equipment. The strike created long delays for
people and companies seeking new telephone installations.
   The major point of contention concerned the company's insistence
that workers share part of their health costs. But the final
settlement did not include any health-cost sharing.

   Roving bands of cunning red foxes are
outwitting Southern California officials, who worry that the
animals threaten endangered native birds and other animals.
   ``The population seems to be exploding now for some reason and
we are not sure why,'' said Larry Sitton, wildlife management
supervisor of the state Department of Fish and Game in Los Angeles.
``This has resulted in a terrible, terrible problem for native
species, pushing some to the brink of extinction.'' Red foxes have
been spotted in Torrance and El Segundo, and near the Los Angeles
International Airport. They attack endangered birds such as the
least tern and the clapper rail.
   Attempts to control the animal, which is not native to the area,
have proved futile.
   ``They are rather shy and wary of people,'' said Rudi Mattoni, a
biologist. ``The story about being foxy is no joke: They are very
difficult to catch.''
   Sarah George, a biologist with the Natural History Museum of Los
Angeles County said no one really knows how the red fox, a native
of the Sierra Nevada, got to this part of the state.
   Mattoni said despite her efforts, up to 20 species of small
animals have disappeared from the dunes just west of the airport
because of the predator's appetite.
   ``Remember how common it used to be to see rabbits on the
runways?'' Mattoni asked. ``Well, ain't no more rabbits.''

<TEXT>
   Alvin Ailey, the dancer and choreographer of
jazz- and gospel-inspired works both accessible and exhilarating,
was hailed as a ``giant'' of modern dance after his death at age 58.
   Ailey's unique, dynamic style introduced black American music
and traditions into modern dance and helped transform it into a
popular art form. He died Friday after suffering for more than a
year from dyscrasia, a blood disorder.
   Singer Harry Belafonte, who toured with Ailey in 1958 and was
his longtime friend, said Ailey ``was just at the beginning of his
achievements. ... He was just at the threshold of his most
important creative years.''
   Ailey died at 4:55 p.m. at Lenox Hill Hospital, said Meg
Gordean, a spokeswoman for his company. Blood dyscrasia is a rare
disorder that affects the bone marrow and red blood cells, said
Ailey's physician, Dr. Albert Knapp.
   ``Alvin Ailey was a giant among American artists, a towering
figure on the international dance scene,'' said Gerald Arpino,
artistic director of The Joffrey Ballet.
   The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater was founded in 1958,
dedicated to the preservation and enrichment of the American modern
dance heritage and the uniqueness of black cultural expression.
   ``He was clearly one of the giants of modern dance,'' said
Michael Wright, executive director of the Erick Hawkins Dance
Company. ``But he also did more for American blacks and American
black culture in dance than any other person that I know of.
   ``He combined a great artistic vision of modern dance with his
cultural heritage.''
   As a dancer, then a choreographer, Ailey was known for his
innovative blend of Afro-Caribbean and modern dance, ballet and
jazz, whilso drew upon the styles of Lester Horton and Martha
Graham.
   Sources of his inspirations included memories of black churches
and honky-tonk bars he knew as a child growig up poor in a small
Texas town, as well as social protest, as in his 1969 ``Masekela
Language,'' which dealt with being black in South Africa.
   Of his 19``Revelations,'' a celebration of black spirituapel
music and small-town religion that became a modern dance, Ailey
once said:
   ``Its roots ican Negro culture, which is part of the whole
heritage. ... But the dance speaks to everyone.Otherwise it
wouldn't work.''
   Ailey's balleappeared in the repertoires of companies include
Joffrey, the American Ballet Theatre, the Pari, the London Festival
Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet.
   Ailey, who stopped dancing in 1965 to concentrate on
choreography, started his troupe with seven members. Today it
numbers 28, many of them graduates of the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Center.
   He was born Jan. 5, 1931, in Rogers, Texas. His mother, Lula,
was 17 at the time and abandoned by her husband six months later.
Mother and son earned a living picking cotton and doing domestic
work.
   At 12, Ailey moved to Los Angeles. He discovered ballet on a
junior high p to see a performance by the Ballet Russe de Monte
Carlo. He ban his professional career with Lester Horton's troupe,
said toountry's first multiracial modern dance company.
   Ailey lefhe Horton Dance Group for a while to study Roman but
became its director after Horton's death in 1953.
   Ailey created 79 ballets and also staged or choreographed for
operas including Samuel Barber's ``Anthony and Cleopatra'' and
Leonard Bernstein's ``Mass.''
   The non-profit Alvin Ailey Dance Theater Foundation Inc.
administers the dance theater; the dance center, a school for dance
training which registers more than 2,500 students a year, and the
Alvin Ailey Repertory Ensemble.
   In 1988, Ailey received Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime
achievement in the performing arts.
   He also received New York City's Handel Medallion and the Samuel
H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award, given for lifetime
contribution to the field of modern dance.
   He is survived by his mother, Lula Cooper; his stepfather,
Fredrick W. Cooper, and a half-brother, Calvin Walls Cooper.

   Lawyers for Washington talk show host John J.
McLaughlin and a former female employee who had filed a $4 million
sexual harassment and discrimination suit against him have reached
an out-of-court settlement.
   Attorneys for McLaughlin and Linda D. Dean, a former executive
assistant at McLaughlin's Oliver Productions, confirmed the
agreement Friday but refused to provide details of the confidential
settlement, The Washington Post reported today.
   McLaughlin, 60, hosts ``The McLaughlin Group,'' a political talk
show that airs weekly on 230 public television stations and four
NBC stations. He is also the host of ``One on One,'' a weekly
interview program.
   Dean's suit had described McLaughlin's office as ``a work
environment which was hostile to women'' and charged McLaughlin
with ``sexually degrading and offensive remarks and behavior ...
toward past and present female employees.''
   The suit alleged that McLaughlin fired Dean in April 1988 after
she refused to resign.
   When the suit was filed, Fred Fielding, McLaughlin's attorney,
issued a statement that said McLaughlin and his production company
``emphatically deny these bizarre and outrageous allegations.''
   McLaughlin, a former Jesuit priest and former Nixon speech
writer, has been married since 1975 to Ann Dore McLaughlin, U.S.
Secretary of Labor in the Reagan administration.
   The Post said it was unable to reach McLaughlin or Dean.

<TEXT>
   Election officials in the Mexican state
of Tamaulipas declared an opposition candidate the winner in the
mayor's race in this border city, but his party claimed fraud in
another contest.
   In Reynosa, another border city, the campaign manager of the
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution accused the ruling
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, of trying to steal the
election by moving the vote count to the state capital, Ciudad
Victoria.
   Candidate Jorge Cardenas Gonzalez was declared the winner in
Matamoros, said Alfredo Davila, vice president of the State
Electoral Commission.
   Statewide mayoral elections were held Sunday, but the vote count
for Matamoros, Reynosa and other cities has been delayed by
protests, accusations of fraud and other problems.
   Davila said the results of the Reynosa mayor's race were not
complete Friday evening.
   Eliud Trevino Guerra, campaign manager for the opposition
mayoral candidate in Reynosa, Ramon Perez Garcia, said the vote
count for Reynosa had been suspiciously moved to Ciudad Victoria
after all of the opposition parties signed off on election results
showing Perez Garcia was the winner.
   Trevino claimed the PRI planned to cook the results.
   Pedro Hernandez Wilson, a PRI campaign coordinator in Reynosa,
said his party won the mayor's race in that city.
   Opposition party activists have been holding protests against
alleged PRI manipulations of the vote since before the polls even
closed. Accusations of fraud are almost routine in Mexico, where
the PRI has held most of the significant elected offices _
including every presidential administration _ since its creation 60
years ago.

   The son of suspended Navajo Chairman
Peter MacDonald appeared before a tribal court after special
prosecutors asked for an arrest warrant to force his return to the
reservation.
   Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr. pleaded innocent Friday in Navajo
District Court to conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's 1987
purchase of a northern Arizona ranch.
   The younger MacDonald had failed to show up at two other
arraignments, claiming that the Tribal Court had no jurisdiction
over him because he no longer lives on the reservation and because
the alleged crimes took place off-reservation.
   Defense attorney Donald Benally told District Judge Robert
Yazzie the younger MacDonald's failure to appear before was ``based
on a misunderstanding.''
   But special prosecutor Mark Donatelli said the younger MacDonald
agreed to the arraignment when he realized that the tribal judge
was planning to issue a bench warrant for his arrest and to start
extradition proceedings against him.
   ``I think he was just trying to see how far he could push the
court,'' Donatelli said.
   Yazzie released the younger MacDonald on his own recognizance
but ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer.
   The senior MacDonald has been on paid administrative leave since
Feb. 17. On Wednesday, he pleaded innocent to 107 criminal charges
alleging he received more than $500,000 in illegal contributions
and kickbacks from 1986 to 1988.
   The elder MacDonald was charged by special prosecutors with
conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations.
The charges focus on the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas
Ranch from non-Indian middlemen who made a $7.2 million profit on
the property.

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Supreme Court granted a
request from both sides in an Illinois abortion dispute to defer
arguments in the case, and a lower court was expected to approve an
out-of-court settlement.
   If it does so, it would defuse tension from a case that had been
viewed by legal experts as a likely opportunity for the high court
to alter the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   ``Because of this morning's action, Illinois is closer to having
a set of regulations that guarantee the health and safety of women
who choose to have an abortion,'' Illinois Attorney General Neil
Hartigan said in a statement Friday.
   The argument session in the case _ in which pro-choice advocates
opposed the state's regulations governing abortion clinics _ had
been scheduled for Tuesday, and many were awaiting the court's
ruling with considerable anticipation.
   The decision to defer arguments will keep the case on the
Supreme Court docket, in limbo, until U.S. District Judge John
Nordburg acts on a settlement reached by the two sides, and they
ask the justices to dismiss the case.
   The key issue in the Illinois dispute is a set of strict
regulations imposed on abortion clinics, where most early-pregnancy
abortions are performed.
   Opponents of the regulations, including the Illinois chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, which successfully had
challenged them in lower courts, said they could severely have
restricted the availability of abortions.
   ``We're gratified by the Supreme Court action in facilitating a
settlement of the lawsuit,'' said ACLU attorney Harvey Grossman.
   State Rep. Penny Pullen, a leading abortion opponent, said the
court's move came as ``no big surprise.''
   ``I am not so sure whether our interests would have been served
having Mr. Hartigan argue the case in the Supreme Court anyway,''
she said.
   Initially, Hartigan had sought to have the Supreme Court uphold
the state regulations and the high court accepted the case for
review last July 3.
   That was the same day the justices announced, in a Missouri
case, a decision giving states greater authority to regulate
abortions.
   But Hartigan, a Democratic candidate for governor in 1990, later
sought a settlement in which Illinois women would be guaranteed
continued access to abortions.
   The legal challenge to the abortion regulations was launched by
Dr. Richard Ragsdale of Rockford.
   Four years ago, Ragsdale won a preliminary injunction against
the regulations in U.S. District Court in Chicago, contending that
the state's elaborate building codes for abortion clinics were
medically unnecessary.

<HEAD>President Says Pakistanis Frustrated After One Year of Democracy</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Ghulam Ishaq Khan told a
joint session of Parliament today that one year after Pakistan's
return to democracy, high expectations have turned into despair.
   He blamed most of poor public morale on the government of Prime
Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   In a toughly worded address to Pakistan's Senate and National
Assembly, Ishaq said ``A year of trading abuses and inaction is
starting to frustrate budding hopes.''
   Ishaq, 77, criticized Ms. Bhutto's left-leaning government and
its center-right political opposition for squandering opportunities
to strengthen Pakistan's fragile democracy, which followed 11 years
of military rule.
   ``Instead of understanding and accommodation there has been
confrontation at all levels and political horse trading,'' he said.
   ``A year ago there was a festive look. Faces were flushed with
fresh resolve and new hope. But now, I'm honestly reflecting the
feelings of millions of our people. They are in the grip of agony
and concern,'' Ishaq said in Urdu.
   Ms. Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party won the largest bloc of
votes in November 1988 in the first free elections in more than a
decade. But an alliance of opposition parties won control of
powerful Punjab province.
   Ishaq said bitter squabbling between the two has given rise to
the admonishment that ``the country's legislators do everything but
legislate.''
   He warned that democracy in developing nations has to be more
than an intellectual exercise. He said charges of corruption, which
have plagued Ms. Bhutto's government, and only incremental
improvements in the quality of life, will weaken ``he common man's
faith in democracy.''
   In an interview after the president's speech, Amnar Piracha, a
People's Party lawmaker, said:
   ``We have to look at what went wrong ... and people may be
upset, but people have not lost faith in the democratic process.''
   She said Ishaq, who was closely aligned with his predecessor,
military President Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, ``has to rise above
past affiliations and play a role in building (relations) between
the federal and provincial governments.''
   The majority of the Punjab lawmakers are also Zia loyalists.
Zia, who overthrew Ms. Bhutto's father in a 1977 coup, died in an
August 1988 plane crash which cleared the way for elections.
   Ishaq complained that Ms. Bhutto's government has done little to
carry on an Islamization program launched by Zia. Before his death,
Zia was trying to introduce an Islamic legal system linking state
and religion.
   Ishaq also warned against parliamentarians changing allegiance
in mid-term, which is illegal under Pakistan's constitution.
   Ms. Bhutto in November inducted three opposition members into
her cabinet, which generated opposition cries that her government
was ignoring the rules. The three, however, have maintained their
original party affiliations.
   On the positive side, the president said Ms. Bhutto's government
has launched an economic renewal program that is making some
progress, particularly in keeping the inflation rate under control.
   He said Pakistan's return to democracy has improved its
international standing and brought economic benefits.

<TEXT>
   A woman who helped her husband spy on the U.S.
government for Israel is out of a federal prison in a halfway
house, prison officials said.
   Anne Henderson-Pollard had served two years and eight months of
her five-year sentence when she was released Nov. 20 from the
federal prison at Danbury, Conn., Steve Finger, acting executive
assistant at the prison, said Friday.
   Her father, Bernard R. Henderson of Secaucus, N.J., said there
was little publicity when she was moved because his daughter _ who
suffers from bilary dyskinesia, a rare gastro-intestinal disorder _
``needed a little time just to stand up. Every day she does a
little better.''
   She was sentenced in March 1987 after pleading guilty to
conspiracy to receive embezzled government property and being an
accessory after the fact to possession of state secrets.
   Her husband, Jonathan Jay Pollard, a former Navy intelligence
analyst, was sentenced to life in prison after pleading guilty to
selling secrets to Israel. He admitted selling classified
information to Israel from 1984 until his arrest in November 1985
for as much as $2,500 a month.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard was placed in the custody of the Women's
Prison Association and Hopper House, which maintains a halfway
house here. She is working at her father's public relations company
in Manhattan.
   Mrs. Henderson-Pollard is scheduled to be released on probation
on March 30.
   She has said she will press for her husband's release, speaking
on his behalf publicly and with U.S. and Israeli officials.

<HEAD>Pancreatic Cancer Again Strikes Former President's Family</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROLYN S. CARLSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deadly pancreatic cancer again has struck the
family of former President Carter, prompting a leading cancer
researcher to suggest regular testing for the entire clan.
   Gloria Carter Spann, Carter's sister, was released Friday from
Emory University Hospital in Atlanta, where the 62-year-old Plains
resident was diagnosed with the ailment, according to a statement
from Dr. Martin York.
   Mrs. Spann is the former president's last surviving sibling. His
father, James Earl Carter Sr., his brother, Billy Carter, and
sister Ruth Carter Stapleton each died of pancreatic cancer.
   While only about 6 percent of pancreatic cancer victims have a
family history of the disease, those who do have it in the family
are several times more likely to get it than the general
population, said Dr. Henry P. Lynch, a professor at Creighton
University School of Medicine in Omaha, Neb.
   ``We recommend a CAT scan of the pancreas or an ultrasound for
people who are at very high risk, such as Jimmy,'' said Lynch, who
recently completed a study of 18 families with 47 members having
pancreatic cancer.
   Lynch said research has shown that the Carter family children
could have a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer, a
disease that has its onset after the late 40s.
   Part of the need for early screening, he said, is that when the
cancer produce symptoms, ``it may have been there growing more
subtly for five or 10 years.''
   Carter's father died of pancreatic cancer in 1953. Billy Carter
died of the disease in September 1988 at age 51. Mrs. Stapleton was
54 when she succumbed to the disease in September 1983.
   Carter's mother, ``Miss Lillian'' Carter, had breast cancer that
had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died
in October 1983 at age 85.
   Mrs. Spann said in a statement released Friday through the
Carter Presidential Center that she was not feeling any symptoms
from the disease, which was diagnosed during routine testing.
   She said she was ``feeling great,'' said center spokeswoman
Casie Hughes. ``In fact, she and her husband Walter are planning to
ride their motorcycles to Florida for the weekend.''
   Researchers have found that pancreatic cancer is almost always
fatal, Lynch said.
   ``In spite of advances in chemotherapy, radiation therapy and
surgery, most patients with pancreatic cancer do not survive more
than a year,'' he said.

<HEAD>Crash Victim Say Airline's Ad Insensitive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Continental Airlines ad that ran in
British publications pokes fun at Boise _ the destination of a
Continental flight that crashed and killed 28 people two years ago.
   The ad pitches 2-for-1 tickets from London to Denver and other
destinations.
   ``Admittedly, there are a few places in the States that we don't
fly to,'' says the ad, which ran about a month ago. ``(But, be
honest, how often do you really need to go to Boise, Idaho?)''
   Idahoans, including Gov. Cecil Andrus, Boise Mayor Dirk
Kempthorne and victims of the Denver crash on Friday blasted what
they called the airline's insensitivity.
   Fourteen Idahoans died and 42 were injured in the Nov. 15, 1987,
crash of Flight 1713.
   On Friday, James V. O'Donnell, Continental's senior vice
president of marketing programs in Houston, apologized and said the
ad was changed immediately after he saw it.
   ``I'm very sorry that it happened,'' said O'Donnell, who said
the ad was crafted by a London agency unaware of the crash. ``It
was anything but intentional; it was based on ignorance.''
   Andrus slammed Continental chairman Frank Lorenzo.
   ``The ad is a cheap shot from a cheapskate,'' Andrus said.
``Unfortunately, the real insult is that in 1987 a lot of people
tried to fly from Denver to Boise on Continental and many of them
died or were injured. The remark is grossly insensitive. But then
again, what do you expect from Frank Lorenzo?''
   O'Donnell said the ad ran this fall in The London Times, The
Financial Times, The Economist magazine and perhaps other
publications. ``It couldn't have run more than a handful of
times,'' he said.
   Dave Daniel of Melba was on Flight 1713, and his wife Tami, was
killed. ``It just confirms your feelings about how callously and
poorly Continental is run. All they're thinking about is the bottom
line,'' he said.
   Continental pulled out of Boise and seven other airports in
September of 1988, saying it would focus on more profitable
destinations. Continental's departure from Boise came 10 months
after the Flight 1713 crash.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's decision to provide air
coverage to the Philippine government during its latest
insurrection could further complicate the issue of future American
military presence in the islands, analysts say.
   Committing U.S. planes to help President Corazon Aquino's
government might make the six American military bases in the
islands more of a terrorist target for some radical critics of the
Philippine government, said one analyst, Richard Fisher of the
Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
   But Fisher said the quick U.S. agreement to Mrs. Aquino's
request for help could also ``favorably influence'' her government
in negotiations starting in about two weeks on a possible extension
of the bases treaty, set to expire in 1991.
   Recognizing strong political opposition to continuing the U.S.
military presence, Mrs. Aquino has not yet declared whether she
favors prolonging the base arrangement. Many U.S. officials predict
a new treaty eventually will be approved.
   John Melegrito, a prominent Filipino-American, said it would
have been wrong not to accept U.S. help against the rebels if
Philippines democracy were truly at stake, and ``the question now
is what will be the price? It will add pressure on the government
as it enters into negotiations, an added complication.''
   The Washington-based Christian Coalition for Philippines Human
Rights issued a statement of concern that the use of American air
power ``in a coup situation may be used in upcoming base talks to
signify continued Philippine dependence on the U.S. military
presence.'' It quoted Manila analysts as saying ``reluctance of
Philippine pilots to fire on their rebel colleagues'' was one
reason U.S. planes were needed for air coverage.
   Melegrito organized a demonstration of more than 50 people
outside Washington's Philippine Embassy Friday that supported the
Aquino government and at the same time urged it to deal more
harshly than in the past with plotters who have attempted at least
five previous coups.
   Along with ``Long Live Cory'' chants and slogans, there were
speeches and placards demanding ``no amnesty for traitors ... lock
them behind bars.''
   Congress was in recess but bipartisan support for President
Bush's decision to provide air support for the Manila government
came from those reached for comment.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called
President Bush's decision to provide air support ``prudent and in
our national interest.'' A country might be justified to use
revolution and military insurrection to rid itself of dictatorship,
Mitchell said, but the Philippines is a democracy.
   ``If there are elements in the Philippines who disagree with
(Aquino's) policies, they have a means to change the government
through election,'' Mitchell said.
   ``President Bush took the kind of measured action required'' in
a situation where Philippines democracy was ``hanging in the
balance, and the safety of the civilian population was at stake,''
said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., chairman of the House
Asia-Pacific subcommittee.

   A treasure trove of artifacts looted from an
ancient Peruvian gravesite is going home after months of legal
wrangling following raids on Southern California art collectors.
   U.S. Customs Service agents delivered six crates carrying 123
pre-Colombian artifacts to Los Angeles International Airport for
shipment Friday night, Customs spokesman Mike Fleming said.
   The artifacts include one piece believed to be 8,000 years old.
   Fleming said representatives of the Peruvian government told
U.S. officials the objects of ceramic, wood, stone, fiber and metal
``have an intrinsic value of $1 million, but their historical value
is priceless.''
   Peruvian President Alan Garcia was scheduled to be on hand to
receive the stolen national treasures upon their arrival in Lima.
   The artifacts were stolen from Peru's Sipan Tomb, an ancient
burial site, more than two years ago, said John Miller, another
Customs spokesman.
   ``They've compared the site in significance to King Tut's (in
Egypt) because it's a site they weren't previously aware of and it
included royalty,'' Miller said. ``A lot of the site is intact and
it will tell a lot more about how people lived and died.''
   Some of the most valuable items, displayed at a news conference
Friday, include gold ear spools and a ceramic sculpture of a man
cutting his own throat.
   They were among 1,300 seized in March 1988 raids on eight
dealers and collectors. One dealer was convicted of making a
fraudulent customs declaration, sentenced to six months in prison
and fined $10,000.

<HEAD>Asian Elephant Dies During Surgery After Caesarean Section</HEAD>
<NOTE>By DAVID SEDENO</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Asian elephant who earlier underwent an
unprecedented Caesarean section died during emergency surgery at
the San Diego Wild Animal Park.
   A team of veterinarians worked on Jean, the 19-year-old,
7,000-pound elephant, for about three hours Friday in hopes of
alleviating complications caused by the death of the fetus in her
womb. But in the end there was nothing they could do to save her,
park spokesman Tom Hanscom said.
   The elephant was destroyed with a fatal dose of anesthetic while
still unconscious for the surgery, he said.
   Jean had been fighting a severe abdominal infection caused by
the dead 300-pound fetus, which was removed Nov. 20 during the
first Caesarean section known to have been performed on an elephant.
   After the infection started, veterinarians fed Jean
intravenously and gave her antibiotics and pain killers, but her
condition did not improve and veterinarians operated again Friday
night in a last-ditch attempt to save the pachyderm's life.
   ``Veterinarians attempted to repair the uterus. They were unable
to do so. They also attempted to do a hysterectomy but were unable
to do that because of its size and inaccessibility,'' Hanscom said.
   Jean had made the record books after being pregnant for more
than 730 days, surpassing the pregnancy of an Asian elephant that
gave birth at a zoo in Germany after 720 days. The normal gestation
period for the Asian elephant is between 618 and 648 days.
   ``If there is any positive sign to the ordeal, in our attempt to
save her life we have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge that
we can hopefully apply to the care of other elephants,'' Hanscom
said.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard gave up its search for five
missing lobstermen after nine days of searching amid snow and fog
over thousands of miles of the Atlantic.
   The hunt for the Heidi Marie and its crew of five was officially
suspended at 5 p.m. Friday. Hundreds of men and women and the Navy,
Air National Guard and even Air Force B-52s from Michigan had taken
part.
   Despite sightings of at least five flares that signaled life
somewhere out in the vast cold sea, neither the boat nor its crew
have been seen or heard from since Nov. 22.
   ``It's a very difficult conclusion to reach, but we've come to
the point where our chances of success are about nil,'' said Rear
Admiral Richard Rybacki, commander of the First Coast Guard
District in Boston, headquarters for the search for the 72-foot
steel-hulled vessel out of Stonington, Conn.
   Aircraft and cutters were deployed over more than 100,000 square
miles in the search.
   ``We feel awful,'' Coast Guard spokesman Steve Aitkins said.
``It is frustrating. You do all you can. It's frustrating for us.
We want to give everybody good news.''
   The last sign of life came Thursday when a Navy plane spotted an
orange object the size of a life raft about 4 feet under water, 300
miles south of Nantucket.
   On Friday, high winds, snow, fog and roiling seas hindered
efforts to get another glimpse of the object.
   The crew included the captain, Mark Middleton, 33, of Norwich,
Conn.; Michael Hare, 22, of Pawcatuck, Conn., Kenneth Raymond
Gould, 20, and Ray Morris III, 19, both of Westerly, R.I., and
Arthur Banks, 25, of Ashaway, R.I.

<TEXT>
   Bill Stout, a veteran television newsman
noted for his tough talk, dry wit and no-nonsense camera presence,
died of a heart attack at age 62.
   Stout died Friday after being hospitalized Thursday at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center for flu-like symptoms.
   He had delivered the last of his trenchant commentaries on
Tuesday for his ``Perspective'' segment of Action News on KCBS-TV,
the CBS-owned television station in Los Angeles. He had been
associated with the network for 36 years, and had written and
reported his commentaries since 1978.
   A curmudgeonly journalist with an irascible yet witty style,
Stout was one of the best known television newsmen in Southern
California.
   Stan Chambers of KTLA-TV said, ``He was really what I would call
the conscience of television news. He was real dedicated. He could
handle very complicated issues and express them with great clarity.
You always wanted to know how Bill felt about an issue because he'd
hit it right on the head.''
   Stout was described as ``one of the few remaining real reporters
in the city'' by Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates when he
received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 1988.
When informed of the honor, Stout said, `Oh God, I have to get out
of this.''
   At the ceremony, however, he was uncharacteristically touched:
``It's easy to be sophisticated and blase and say, `Who cares?,'
but I am overwhelmed.''
   Stout was born in Los Angeles and graduated from UCLA with a
degree in English at the age of 19. His first reporting jobs were
with the now-defunct Minneapolis Times and later with The
Associated Press.
   He came to KNXT, which later became KCBS-TV, in 1950, and spent
the next seven years as a writer, researcher and reporter for the
investigative series ``Special Assignment.'' In 1960 he went to
KTLA-TV as an investigative reporter and news anchor. He joined CBS
News in 1963 and for nine years was its Los Angeles correspondent.
He returned to KCBS-TV in 1972.
   Stout's ``Perspective'' series on the station had been
recognized over the years with many local Emmy awards, Golden Mike
awards and honors from the California Associated Press Television
and Radio Association. Earlier this year he won the Freedom of
Information Award from the Los Angeles chapter of the Society of
Professional Journalists.
   Stout had anchored KCBS-TV's special coverage of major events,
such as elections and the visit of Pope John Paul II. He also had
been a moderator of ``Newsmakers,'' a weekly KCBS-TV news interview
series.
   He is survived by his wife, Margaret, and eight children.
   Funeral services were pending.

   Lawyers for one of the four youths shot by
subway gunman Bernard Goetz demanded a judge declare Goetz the
loser in a $50 million lawsuit after he failed to appear for a
deposition hearing.
   ``Basically, the man's a coward when he doesn't have a gun with
him,'' Ron Kuby said. ``He has absolutely no respect for his legal
obligations.''
   Kuby and the other lawyer, William Kunstler, filed the motion
for sanctions against Goetz in Bronx Supreme Court on Friday in the
lawsuit brought by Darrell Cabey.
   The motion will be heard Dec. 18 by a judge to be appointed at
that time, Kunstler said.
   A request for comment left on Goetz's telephone answering
machine drew no response.
   Cabey and three companions, Barry Allen, Troy Canty and James
Ramseur, all teen-agers at the time, were shot by Goetz when they
approached him in a subway car Dec. 22, 1984. Goetz said they
intended to rob him; they said they were panhandling.
   Kuby said that Cabey, paralyzed and brain-damaged by one of
Goetz's bullets, has been declared incompetent and unable to give
testimony.
   Goetz, 42, was acquitted of attempted murder but found guilty of
a weapon law violation, for which he eventually served eight months.
   Several civil suits against Goetz have been pending in the
Bronx, brought by Cabey for $50 million, Canty for $5 million, and
Ramseur for $8.5 million.

   The security chief of a Montana church
that teaches nuclear war is inevitable was sentenced to three years
probation for using false identification to buy weapons for 200
members.
   Vernon Hamilton, 42, a 15-year member of the Church Universal
and Triumphant, also was fined $1,000 by U.S. District Judge Justin
Quackenbush.
   Hamilton said the firearms were only intended to protect members
from nuclear war.
   ``They were intended for myself and Mr. Francis (church vice
president Edward Francis) to be used only to protect our loved ones

civilization as we now know it,'' Hamilton said.
   The church, which teaches a blend of Eastern and Western
religions, is located on 33,000 acres of land bordering Yellowstone
National Park in Park County, Mont. Members have built bomb
shelters on the property in preparation for what they believe is an
inevitable nuclear war between world superpowers.
   Members follow the teachings of Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who is
said to receive spiritual and metaphysical messages from ``ascended
masters'' such as Jesus Christ.
   Hamilton pleaded guilty in October to conspiracy to use false
identification to purchase $150,000 worth of weapons and ammunition.
   He was arrested July 7 in Spokane, and a search of his car and a
rented storage space turned up seven .50-caliber assault rifles,
several sniper rifles and armor-piercing and tracer ammunition.
Federal agents also found $26,000 in cash and gold coins and
documents indicating plans to outfit 200 people with military-style
assault weapons.
   Hamilton said he used bogus identification to spare the church
from ``public ridicule.'' He said Francis, the church's vice
president and business manager, supplied him with the money to buy
the weapons.
   Francis has also pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge and
will be sentenced Dec. 15, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Rice.
   Prophet, called ``Guru Ma'' or simply ``Mother'' by followers,
has said church leaders did not sanction the arms purchase.

   President Bush, feeling ``pretty
good'' despite rough seas, received an update early today on the
coup attempt in the Philippines before embarking on his first
summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   High seas and gale-force winds forced a change in the site of
today's U.S.-Soviet talks to the Maxim Gorky, a Soviet cruise ship
anchored off Malta, and cancellation of the opening summit
ceremonies. But the talks began as scheduled.
   Bush took the admiral's barge from the USS Belknap, his summit
residence, to the Maxim Gorky, where he was met by Gorbachev. The
two leaders shook hands, and Bush told Gorbachev, ``Let's go to
work.''
   He told reporters he was ``feeling pretty good'' and that he
slept ``fine, just fine ... piece of cake.''
   White House officials said Bush awoke at 7 a.m. this morning
and, at a breakfast meeting, was given a detailed report on the
situation in the Philippines by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, White House chief of staff John Sununu and Brent Scowcroft,
the national security adviser.
   In Manila, renewed fighting was reported today as government
warplanes and helicopters hit remaining rebel positions. Rebels
were reported still holding an air base in the central Philippines,
and hundreds were gathered outside armed forces headquarters in
Manila and in the city's financial district. But the Aquino
government said the coup attempt had been defeated.
   Since arriving in Malta early Friday, Bush has divided his time
between preparations for his meetings with Gorbachev and updates on
the attempt by rebel military officials to topple the government of
Corazon Aquino. Bush, at the request of Mrs. Aquino, ordered U.S.
fighter jets Friday to provide air cover and help the government
defend against the coup attempt.
   Bush was already over the Atlantic Ocean on his way to Malta
when Mrs. Aquino asked for U.S. air cover to halt rebel air attacks
and keep the mutineers pinned down in two air bases they
controlled. A few hours earlier, the rebels had bombed the
presidential palace in the most serious effort to bring down Mrs.
Aquino since she came to power in 1986.
   The president approved the request from aboard Air Force One at
12:30 p.m. Manila time (11:30 p.m. EDT), and the decision was
relayed to Mrs. Aquino an hour later from Washington by Vice
President Dan Quayle, said Roman Popadiuk, deputy press secretary.
   ``The process went well under very difficult circumstances,''
Popadiuk said, noting that the request came late at night while
Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III were both in flight.
   In addition to the Air Force F-4 Phantom jets providing air
cover, 100 Marines were sent from a U.S. base to protect the U.S.
Embassy in Manila, Popadiuk said.
   ``There are no reports of any injuries to Americans, or any
attacks on Americans,'' he said.
   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said no U.S.
planes had ``fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft.''
   Even limited U.S. military intervention could give Gorbachev a
rejoinder to complaints Bush planned to lodge about Soviet military
involvement in Afghanistan, El Salvador, Nicaragua and elsewhere.
   Arkady Maslennikov, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet,
criticized Bush's decision.
   ``Any interference in internal developments, especially by
outside powers, is destructive and leads to deterioration of the
situation,'' he said. ``In any event, the best thing is to allow
the Filipinos themselves to sort it out.''
   Popadiuk said Bush's motive was twofold: ``A democratic
government has asked for assistance; we have American lives to
protect.''

   Two Southern Pacific freight trains collided
today, knocked eight cars into a swamp and forced the evacuation of
more than 50 people for fear hazardous materials were leaking.
   But authorities quickly determined there was no leak, and
everyone was allowed to return home, said Capt. Sam Zinna, a
sheriff's spokesman. There were no injuries.
   Zinna said it happened as one train with 106 cars en route from
Houston to New Orleans on the main line passed a spur line. New
Orleans is about 15 miles to the east. He said the train on the
spur line was waiting for the main track to clear but was slowly
backing and hit the rear cars of the passing train.
   Eight tank cars carrying flammable, hazardous materials _
including liquefied petroleum gas _ were derailed from the main
line and fell into the swamp along the tracks on their sides, Zinna
said.
   Two empty flatcars on the rear of the spur line train were
knocked off the tracks but didn't overturn, he said.
   People within one mile were temporarily evacuated. He estimated
50 to 75 people were evacuated from the area, which has a sparse
population.
   The derailed tank cars will be unloaded into other tank cars
before the job of righting them. ``That will probably take all
weekend,'' Zinna said.

<TEXT>
   Communist leaders, paving the way
for a new government, have developed a blueprint for reform that
charts a course for the future and dramatically alters the official
view of the past.
   Vasil Mohorita, a member of the ruling Politburo, unveiled an
``action program'' Friday for the party that meets some of the
demands of opposition groups who have spurred historic change in
the country.
   In Bratislava, an estimated 60,000 demonstrators Friday
celebrated the sudden changes in Czechoslvakia. The crowd braved
freezing temperatures for 2{ hours to cheer speakers invoking the
need for unity in achieving democracy in Czechoslovakia.
   The Politburo plan announced by Mohorita changes the official
Communist Party view that the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the
1968 ``Prague Spring'' reforms was justified.
   ``We are of the opinion that the intervention of five countries
in 1968 was not justified and the decision to do it was wrong,''
Mohorita said at a news conference.
   Mohorita said no decision had yet been made on another
opposition demand to end direct Communist control of the workplace.
   The draft also pledges the Communists ``will not interfere with
the media,'' Mohorita said.
   The proposed government plan outlines the ``new position'' of
the party following a vote by Parliament Wednesday scrapping
constitutional provisions guaranteeing the party a monopoly on
power, Mohorita said.
   The program has to be approved by the party's Central Committee
and be adopted by a party congress tentatively scheduled for Jan.
26.
   The Central Committee is scheduled to meet on Dec. 14, Mohorita
said, and could vote to hold the congress sooner.
   The party daily Rude Pravo reported Friday that the Politburo
had ordered the creation of a special commission to re-evaluate the
1968 reforms and ``the circumstances under which the armies of five
Socialist countries entered Czechoslovakia.''
   The commission's report would augment the decision already taken
by the Politburo, Mohorita said.
   The news came a day after more radical reversals of previous
policy. Czechoslovakia announced it would remove part of its border
with Austria and lifted virtually all restrictions on travel to the
West.
   The Interior Ministry said Friday that work on dismantling the
grim barbed wire, watchtowers and trip wire along sections of the
border with Austria would likely not begin until the second half of
December.
   Meanwhile, senior government official Frantisek Pitra renewed
talks with dissident Vaclav Havel on forming a new government that
will include non-Communists. The composition of the government is
to be announced by Sunday.
   Party chief Karel Urbanek backed the decision to review the 1968
reforms, which were introduced by liberal party leader Alexander
Dubcek, who was ousted in disgrace after the invasion.
   Mohorita's statement from the Politburo paved the way for a
possible reassessment of the reforms and invasion by the Warsaw
Pact at meeting in Moscow next week following the Malta summit of
President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   East Germany, Poland and Hungary have said the invasion was
wrong. The Soviet Union and Bulgaria have not, and Gorbachev has
said a re-evaluation by the Warsaw Pact alliance could take place
only if requested by Czechoslovakia.
   In Milan, Italy, on Friday, Gorbachev did say the ``Prague
Spring'' reform movement of 1968 was ``right at that time and is
right now.'' But he stopped short of apologizing for the invasion.
   Mohorita said there would have to be a ``new attitude toward
former leaders,'' but he did not say if that referred to Dubcek or
hard-liners who took charge after the liberal leadership was ousted.
   Dubcek has been cheered as a hero by thousands of people at
pro-democracy rallies. The hard-liners who ousted him were removed
in a party shake-up last week following 11 days of demonstrations.

   The Maxim Gorky, site of the first
summit talks between President Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev, is
the Soviets' most luxurious cruise ship and the Kremlin leader's
floating hotel for the Malta meeting.
   Today's summit talks were to have been held on the Slava, a
Soviet guided missile cruiser rolling at anchor within sight of the
slightly larger cruise ship, but rough weather prompted officials
to shift to the Gorky, which was brought to Malta to house the
Soviet entourage.
   Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, spent Friday night aboard the
630-foot luxury passenger liner, which is tied up to a pier in the
wind-swept Marsaxlokk Bay.
   The white-hulled ship, which boasts 12 decks, heated outdoor and
indoor swimming pools and a sauna deck with medicinal baths, is
distinguished by the yellow hammer and sickle painted on a red band
around the single smokestack.
   The two presidents met in the Card Room on the Promenade Deck.
   The Gorky, named for the Soviets' most famous revolutionary
writer, was built in West Germany 20 years ago and purchased by the
Soviets' Black Sea Shipping Co. in 1974. It has been used since to
generate hard currency by carrying West Germans and other foreign
tourists on North Sea cruises.
   Westerners who have sailed aboard the ship say it offers very
good service, uncharacteristic of Soviet tourist enterprises, and
relatively inexpensive cruises.
   The luxury liner struck an iceflow in the Arctic off Norway last
June, forcing evacuation of the 575 passengers and most of the 377
crew members. Norwegian vessels took the evacuees on board, and no
one was reported injured.
   The ship underwent extensive repairs and refurbishing after the
accident and is reported to have been modernized and fitted with
even more luxurious compartments than it had before.
   Izvestia, the Soviet government newspaper, reported at the time
the Gorky was ``one of the biggest and technically best-equipped
passenger ships'' of the Soviet maritime fleet.

<HEAD>Armenian Legislature Votes to Annex Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Armenian legislature has voted to annex a
disputed region in a neighboring republic, an activist said today,
in a move that defied the federal government and could cause
further ethnic violence.
   The lawmakers claimed the region, the Nagorno-Karabakh enclave,
on Friday after the national parliament asked Armenia's neighbor,
the republic of Azerbaijan, to quell tensions over the area, the
activist said.
   The Armenian Supreme Soviet and the National Council of
Nagorno-Karabakh informed the national government of the
annexation, the activist, Karen Shakhbazyan, said in a telephone
interview.
   The national government probably will not recognize the action,
taken in the Armenian capital, Yerevan.
   Nagorno-Karabakh's population is predominantly ethnic Armenian
and Christian, but the mountainous region is located in Azerbaijan,
which is mostly Moslem. Despite being called a Soviet autonomous
region, the enclave is supposed to obey the Azerbaijani government
in Baku.
   Unconfirmed reports earlier in the week said three people were
killed in violence stemming from the dispute, adding to dozens who
have been killed in the past 18 months.
   Shakhbazyan, speaking from Yerevan, said many Armenian deputies
will boycott the second session of the national Congress of
People's Deputies which begins Dec. 12 in Moscow.
   He accused Azerbaijan of imposing a new rail blockade on Armenia
like the one that halted shipment of fuel, food and other goods
this fall.
   No trains had arrived from Nakhichivan, a small area of
Azerbaijan sandwiched between Armenia and Iran, since Nov. 28, he
said. Trains were arriving on schedule from the Georgian republic
in the north, he reported.
   The Armenian population, citing what they call years of willful
neglect by Azerbaijan, began demanding in February 1988 that
Armenia annex Nagorno-Karabakh area.
   Mosow has rejected that demand, and in January it imposed direct
rule through a commission headed by Arkady Volsky.
   On Tuesday, the final day of the national Supreme Soviet's fall
session, legislators replaced the Volsky commission with a
legislative oversight commission.
   The Supreme Soviet also ordered Azerbaijan to work with local
officials in Nagorno-Karabakh to restore order. In the meantime,
Interior Ministry soldiers are to stay in the area.
   Azerbaijani activists have expressed displeasure with the
decision as well.
   Ekhtibar Mamedov, leader of the Azerbaijan People's Front
political movement, claimed there was a secret provision in the
Supreme Soviet declaration that prevents Azerbaijan from
interfering in Armenia's affairs.

   Hundreds of museums and galleries throughout the country
observed AIDS Awareness Day by holding memorial services,
temporarily removing art masterpieces to symbolize the disease's
ravages in the arts community.
   ``The point of `A Day Without Art' is to refer metaphorically to
loss and to try to get more people as concerned with the loss from
AIDS as it is often, with, say, earthquakes and other tragedies
that occur,'' said Philip Yenawine, director of education at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York and co-chairman of the nationwide
project.
   Some 600 art institutions participated in the Friday observance,
organizers said. A group of arts professionals called Visual AIDS
organized ``A Day Without Art'' to coincide with the World Health
Organization's second AIDS Awareness Day.
   Elsewhere, nearly 80 people were arrested in a protest in
Washington and New England corporate leaders convened in Boston to
discuss how the business world can better respond to the AIDS
epidemic.
   In New York, numerous art galleries closed for the day or
temporarily darkened their halls. At the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, Picasso's ``Portrait of Gertrude Stein'' was removed and a
placard was put in its place to explain the loss the art community
is experiencing because of AIDS.
   Elizabeth Taylor, chairwoman of the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, told reporters at the Museum of Modern Art that the
observance was just a small reminder of the plague, ``and everybody
in this world needs to be reminded time and time again.''
   At a 14th Street subway station, artist Ross Lewis encouraged
people to put the names of dead friends on index cards and tape
them to black paper with which he had covered a colorful mural.
   About 100 demonstrators marched in front of the New York office
of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to protest the U.S.
policy of forcing HIV-infected immigrants to get a special waiver.
   At the University of Maine Museum of Art in Orono, workers
draped the artwork in black.
   ``There are huge social losses and artistic losses in the art
world'' because of AIDS, said Charles Shepard, museum director.
   Similar observances were held in Atlanta, where the Arts
Exchange gallery was closed; in Pittsburgh, where lights were
dimmed for 10 minutes at the Carnegie Museum of Art; in Seattle,
where large black shrouds were hung over many downtown sculptures;
and in Los Angeles, where visitors to the Museum of Contemporary
Art and the County Museum of Art found the usual admission fees
waived and were asked instead to donate to the AIDS Project Los
Angeles.
   In New Orleans, the NO-AIDS task force displayed children's
artistic conception of AIDS. One simply had the word ``choose''
between the words ``AIDS'' and ``life,'' said Lisa Lee, a member of
the task force.
   In Washington, nearly 80 demonstrators were arrested Friday
after they sat down on Pennsylvania Avenue in front of the White
House to protest what they called the government's lack of
leadership in the AIDS epidemic.
   Those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200
people who attended an earlier rally criticizing President Bush for
what they said was the government's inadequate support for AIDS
research and services.
   At a conference at Boston's World Trade Center, business leaders
attended a variety of seminars on how to deal with acquired immune
deficiency syndrome in the workplace.
   ``A lot more things like these need to be done,'' said William
Baumhaur, president of the Fuddruckers hamburger chain and keynote
speaker at the conference. ``Every business will be impacted by
AIDS. We can't ignore it.''
   As of the end of October, the federal Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta had recorded 112,241 cases of AIDS in the United
States, with 66,493 deaths.
   AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system,
leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread
most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by
drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant
women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
   Two events this past week called attention to a
new headache of the technological era: the cost of reducing human
exposure to electromagnetic radiation.
   On Monday, International Business Machines Corp. confirmed that
it cut radiation from its new large-computer terminals to comply
with requests from European customers.
   On Wednesday, a researcher from Johns Hopkins University said
she had found a link between cancer and human exposure to
electromagnetic fields from power lines.
   The twin developments highlighted public concerns about whether
electricity _ the lifeblood of modern society _ could be harming
the people it is intended to serve.
   Most of the discussion so far has focused on whether
electromagnetic radiation really is harmful and in what amounts.
But even if the early warnings turn out to be overstated, a
movement to reduce human exposure to it seems to be well under way.
   The questions are what steps can be taken to cut exposure and
how much will they cost? The reassuring answer is that many steps
can be taken easily and cheaply. Even daunting problems may prove
easier to solve than many think.
   Louis Slesin, who began putting out Microwave News in New York
City a decade ago, said the latest developments carry conflicting
messages.
   On the bad side, he said, the Johns Hopkins study indicated
biological effects from alarmingly low levels of electromagnetic
radiation.
   But on the good side, the new IBM displays show that cutting
radiation _ at least in the case of video display terminals _ does
not always have to be expensive. An IBM official said this past
week that the new displays were built about as inexpensively as the
old ones.
   IBM, incidentally, says it produced the new displays only to
satisfy customer demands, not because of any health concerns. So
far no other companies have followed suit.
   IBM's new terminals don't reduce radiation at a frequency of 60
hertz (cycles per second), the frequency that has been implicated
in several medical studies, including the one at Johns Hopkins.
   Sixty hertz radiation is emitted by all kinds of electrical
devices, from hair dryers to coffeemakers to larger
electricity-powered machines.
   Fortunately, early studies indicate that any danger is mainly
from long-term exposure at sufficiently close ranges. The fields of
most devices drop off sharply a few inches away, and people don't
spend all day with them.
   Electric blankets and electrically heated water beds would seem
to be possible problems. Although Underwriters Laboratories says it
has no reason to believe they are dangerous, there may be better
ways to stay warm at night, advises a valuable new 45-page booklet
from the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
   Likewise, the hazard of video display terminals, if any, can be
minimized by keeping an arm's length from the screen and a greater
distance from neighboring terminals.
   There may even be relatively inexpensive ways to deal with power
lines, both the long-distance transmission lines and the
high-current distribution lines that go straight into populated
areas.
   According to Slesin, one way to cut power lines' fields is
disarmingly simple: Anchor two wires side by side, as in the
average extension cord. Their alternating current fields should
substantially cancel each other out.
   Utilities have gotten interested because the public's fear of
electromagnetic fields has contributed to long delays in building
transmission lines _ even longer than the notorious delays in
building new generating plants.
   Power lines will be ``the knottiest problem of all,'' said Paul
Brodeur, a New Yorker magazine writer and author of the newly
published ``Currents of Death,'' a critical study of the
electromagnetic radiation issue.
   Still, Brodeur said, ``We live in a vey advanced technological
nation. Now that the Cold War appears to be coming to an end, this
is not all that big of a deal.''
   Slesin agreed: ``I'll make you a bet that with a couple years of
research, the electrical utilities will be able to reduce magnetic
fields from power lines at relatively low cost by restringing and
rewiring the power lines.''
   ``I have great confidence in the ingenuity of American
engineers,'' Slesin said. ``We can solve problems if we decide
they're worth solving.''
   In other business and economic news this past week:
   _OPEC ministers meeting in Vienna settled on a production plan
that they hope will control surging oil output and head off an
expected price slump. Its success depends on whether some major
Persian Gulf producers such as the United Arab Emirates abide by
their output limits.
   _The government revised its estimate of third-quarter economic
growth upward to 2.7 percent. But many economists said they
expected much slower growth in the current quarter. According to
another report, personal spending fell 0.2 percent in September,
the first drop in more than a year.

   The Federal Reserve didn't come through with a
widely expected cut in interest rates this past week, but investors
remained optimistic anyway and stock prices rose.
   ``This was the first sign since the Oct. 13 mini-crash that the
stock market has accepted bad news with any grace,'' said Wall
Street analyst John D. Connolly of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The renewed optimism grew out of the latest economic indicators
that point to a fourth-quarter economic slowdown, and expectations
that the Federal Reserve will cut short-term interest rates to
stimulate growth.
   Data on October's personal spending and leading indicators and
the outlook for November manufacturing growth all declined, while
last month's jobless claims rose.
   ``We now live under the perverse perception that what's bad for
the economy is good for the market under the guise that the Fed
will lower interest rates,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical analyst
with Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.
   The Fed jolted the financial markets Monday by signaling that it
was not intentionally lowering short-term interest rates, contrary
to popular speculation. The loud and clear message came in the form
of the Fed draining funds from the banking system, which pushed
short-term rates higher.
   The assumption that the Fed was allowing short-term rates to
fall grew out of a sharp drop the previous week in the federal
funds rate, the interest banks charge each another for overnight
loans.
   The new thinking since Monday is that the Fed will lower rates,
albeit more slowly than expected, thereby stimulating the economy
and bolstering sagging corporate profits in the new year.
   Analysts said this week's stock market activity pointed to a
growing optimism following several weeks of uncertainty. Since Oct.
13, when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 190
points, many investors had shied away from any kind of commitment.
   Though some blue-chip stocks have been strong, as reflected in
the Dow average, the timidity was evident in the broader market,
which has languished. Stocks that have performed best are the
larger capitalization issues, companies with reputations for
long-term, uninterrupted growth.
   ``There's still some apprehension, but growing confidence,''
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
``The reason the market has been this good in the face of a slowing
economy is because it anticipates that the slowdown won't last that
long because the Fed will take steps to lower short-term rates.''
   Further fueling the argument for lower interest rates is a
growing consensus among economists that real GNP growth will slow
to roughly 1.5 percent in the final quarter of 1989 from 2.7
percent in the previous three months, analysts said.
   A surprise rally on Friday ahead of the weekend U.S.-Soviet
summit helped boost the Dow Jones Average to a 2,747.65 closing on
the week, up 72.10 points from the previous week and the 10th
highest finish ever.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 160.57 million shares a day, up
from a daily average of 127.02 million the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index closed the week up
3.37 at 193.66; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter
market advanced to 457, up 0.47; and the American Stock Exchange
market value index added 2.44 to 375.58.
   Analysts said the outlook for the market is positive as the year
draws to a close and some said they hope for a ``Santa Claus
rally.'' Two stimulants may help fuel the upward momentum, said
Alfred E. Goldman, vice president of A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis.
   ``Professional money managers get a big inflow of corporate
profit and pension fund money that gets invested,'' Goldman said.
``Secondly, the Christmas spirit makes people feel good.''
   However, Goldman and other analysts say the market might have to
give more ground first. ``Markets just don't go straight up.''

   One of world's longest insurgencies
formally ended today as guerrillas of the Communist Party of Malaya
pledged to lay down their arms and vowed loyalty to Malaysia.
   Cease-fire agreements signed by the Communists, Malaysia and
Thailand brought to a close 41 years of conflict that cost
thousands of lives and at one time involved 70,000 British and
Commonwealth troops.
   Analysts in Thailand and Malaysia said meager prospects for
success, changes sweeping the Communist world and perhaps China's
reluctance to be linked to the insurgency led to the cease-fire.
   Under the agreements, 1,200 guerrillas who operate mostly along
the rugged, 375-mile frontier are to lay down their arms and return
to civilian life.
   The Communist Party's general-secretary, Chin Peng, pledged
loyalty to the Malaysian government. ``We shall disband our armed
units and destroy our weapons to show our sincerity to terminate
the armed struggle,'' he said.
   A joint communique said the Communists had agreed ``to terminate
all armed activities and bring peace to the entire Thai-Malaysian
border and Malaysia.''
   The communique said Thailand and Malaysia will ensure fair
treatment for the disbanded Communists, who began their ``war of
liberation'' in 1948 when Britain ruled what was then called Malaya
as a colony.
   ``The government of Malaysia will in due course allow former
members of the disbanded armed units ... to freely participate in
political activities within (the) framework of the federal
constitution and the laws of Malaysia,'' the statement said.
   The Communists in turn pledged to respect the laws of the two
countries and to participate in social and economic development.
   Chin Peng said the agreements were ``consistent with the current
historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving
for peace and democracy.''
   On the eve of the ceremony, police lifted a 41-year-old curfew
in many parts of Malaysia because they said there was no longer any
threat from the guerrillas.
   The statement said two agreements were reached, one between
Malaysia and the Communist Party and the other between Thailand's
Internal Security Operations Command and the Communists.
   The ceremony took place in Hat Yai, a southern Thai city 30
miles from the Malaysian border.
   Chin Peng, who was last seen outside the Communist world in
1955, signed the agreements along with Thailand's army commander,
Gen. Chaovalit Yongchaiyudh, and Wan Sidek, secretary-general of
the Home Affairs Ministry of Malaysia.
   In the late 1940s and 1950s, the Commonwealth mobilized 70,000
troops to fight the largely ethnic Chinese insurgents, and the
British-led force drove them into the jungle along the
Thai-Malaysian border.
   The British effort ended in 1960 after the deaths of more than
10,000 on both sides. But fighting on a lesser scale continued
through the next decade, culminating with several successful
Thai-Malaysian border sweeps and a Thai amnesty that enticed large
numbers of guerrillas to surrender.
   Despite the peace agreement, Malaysia has no plans to do away
with internal security measures that allow for indefinite detention
without trial.
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad told reporters Friday that the
law had helped maintain peace in a multiracial country.
   Critics of Mahathir say the law is used to arrest activists who
oppose government policies. About 65 people are being held under
the law.
   Of Malaysia's 17 million people, 55 percent are Malays, 37
percent are Chinese and almost all the rest are Indians.

   President F.W. de Klerk of
South Africa said today that imprisoned black nationalist Nelson
Mandela will be freed but he declined to say when.
   De Klerk also said reforms undertaken by his government were
being recognized by African and other foreign governments.
   ``There is a spirit of hope, and people are reaching out for
each other in South Africa,'' he said.
   Speaking at a news conference after a day of talks with Ivorian
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, de Klerk said: ``As and when it
is possible, he (Mandela) will be released.''
   He declined to elaborate.
   De Klerk said he hopes to establish full diplomatic relations
with Ivory Coast, whose president has praised his reforms but has
insisted that Mandela be released before relations can be
established.
   ``I don't think it is a dream. It can become a reality,'' de
Klerk said.
   He said he wouldn't speculate on the timing of such a move,
because the Ivorian government must make its own decision.

   A United Nations mission to
help civil war refugees fled after its office was smashed and its
members were threatened.
   Gonzalo Perez, the chief U.N. representative here, said the
mission of about 30 members was evacuated Friday ``for lack of
guarantees'' and that the office will be transferred to Guatemala.
   The program was administered by UNICEF to help people displaced
by the decade-old war between leftist guerrillas and government
troops and to sponsor development programs.
   The U.N. office in Escalon was damaged Wednesday when guerrillas
invaded it and the adjoining affluent section of San Benito on the
city's west side.
   Employees inside the building were evacuated by the Green Cross,
an organization similar to the Red Cross, during a lull in the
fighting.
   Government troops entered the U.N. office later, Perez said, and
an inspection on Thursday, after the guerrillas pulled out of the
area, showed extensive destruction.
   The front of the building was pocked with bullet holes, and
equipment and furniture inside appeared to have been deliberately
smashed, Perez said.
   President Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government did not admit
responsibility for the damage. But Ernesto Ferreiro, the Foreign
Ministry's protocol chief, said he extended apologies to Perez on
behalf of Cristiani.
   On Thursday, more than 240 Americans were evacuated, most from
the Escalon-San Benito area. They included private citizens and
U.S. Embassy personnel and dependents.
   On Friday, Eloy Guevara, a photo stringer working for Agence
France-Presse, was killed by gunfire after a clash between
guerrillas and government soldiers in the working-class district of
Soyapango.
   Guevara, 27, was the 18th journalist killed since the war began
in late 1979 and the second since the guerrillas launched an
all-out attack, in phases, on the capital Nov. 11.
   Two reporters at the scene said Guevara was hit by assault rifle
fire as he crossed an intersection with three Red Cross workers,
and the fire came from the side of the street controlled by air
force paratroopers.
   Guerrillas had withdrawn from positions on the other side of the
street more than an hour before, and military officers on the scene
had given the Red Cross workers the go-head to proceed, the
witnesses said.
   Both insisted on not being identified by name for fear of
reprisals.

<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two candidates who want Taiwan to reassess
its relationship with China took early leads today in this nation's
first democratic election. Officials reported widespread
vote-buying.
   Long lines of voters waited to cast ballots, and state radio
reported a heavy turnout to choose legislators, municipal and
county officials. Tens of thousands of police guarded polling
places to prevent violence.
   The election was expected to mark a major step in Taiwan's march
toward democracy after four decades of rule by the Nationalists,
who lost a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland in
1949. It was the first election to include opposition candidates
and will test the opposition Democratic Progressive Party,
legalized at the end of martial law in 1987.
   Results were expected early Sunday. In all, 722 candidates ran
in the legislative, mayoral and county races.
   The Nationalists cannot lose all power in the election. The
256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by
elderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in
the late 1940s to support the party's claim that it is the
legitimate government of all China.
   The electoral college will choose a president next year.
   The most contentious campaign issue involved some opposition
calls for Taiwan's independence, a seditious act under Taiwan's
constitution. Communist China has threatened to invade Taiwan if it
declares independence.
   In one Taipei district, candidate Yeh Chu-lan, an independence
activist, was among the leaders for a seat in the legislature.
   Mrs. Yeh is the widow of Cheng Nan-Rong, who killed himself in
April to avoid a police investigation for advocating independence
for Taiwan. In her campaign, Mrs. Yeh continued her husband's work
and risks prosecution.
   Incomplete results indicated that Jaw Shau-kong, a popular
Nationalist legislator, was far ahead in his Taipei district. Jaw
has pushed for political reform, calling for the retirement of
aging legislators and negotiations with the Communist government in
Beijing.
   In the industrial city of Kaohsiung, Hsu Hsiao-dan, a former
dancer, model and painter, was behind. Ms. Hsu called for universal
love and freedom in her campaign and distributed nude photos of
herself.
   The Independence Evening News today reported large-scale
distribution of ``silver bullets,'' or bribes, before campaigning
ended Friday.
   ``Some candidates threw down big bucks,'' it said.
   The paper's sister publication, the Independence Morning News,
was sued for libel by the Nationalist Party Friday after it accused
the Nationalists of vote-buying.
   Financial officials have said cash in circulation jumped by $1.1
billion in the past week because of vote-buying.
   During balloting today several voters told The Associated Press
they had sold their votes.
   One voter said she sold her and her husband's vote to a
Nationalist candidate for $19 each. Other voters said that was the
going price, although one women said she only received $8 for her
vote.
   A spokesman for the Central Election Commission reported scores
of cases of vote-buying and intimidation.
   The spokesman, Ho En-pao, said investigations were under way and
that evidence had been found in several cases. He did not disclose
which party was to blame.
   In the only report of violence, a fight broke out in the
northwestern city of Hualian after opposition candidates
photographed a man voting on behalf of an elderly man. State radio
said the elderly man's hands were shaking so he needed help.
Election officials said the case was under investigation.
   Taiwan's three government TV stations initially gave almost
exclusive coverage to Nationalist candidates but yielded under
pressure from the public.
   The opposition claimed the Nationalists were helped by an
immense party machine that mobilized village chiefs and other
politicians to secure votes.
   Nationalists had also been accused of sabotaging opposition
office and shooting an independent candidate. The Nationalists
denied the charges.

   A top Communist Party official resigned today
and accused the East German leadership of being incapable of
overseeing the political and economic reforms demanded by the
pro-democracy movement.
   The resignation of Central Committee Secretary Hans-Joachim
Willerding was another blow to embattled party chief Egon Krenz,
who has been trying to gain respect for the party as it faces a
challenge to its 40-year monopoly on power.
   Willerding stepped down a day after the East German public was
told how top party leaders took bribes, lived opulent lifestyles,
went on luxury vacations and squirreled away billions of dollars in
Swiss bank accounts.
   Willerding told the official ADN news agency that he had no
confidence the leadership could gain the authority to lead the
drive for democratic change.
   ``Renewal is possible only when the Communist Party leads with
unity and determination,'' he said.
   He called for swift action against former leaders who abused
their powers.
   Willerding was named secretary of the powerful Central Committee
and a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo less than a month
ago, after Erich Honecker's longtime government was forced to
resign.
   Krenz, 52, has been trying desperately to distance himself from
the old guard, of which had been a prominent member.
   Shaking their heads in disbelief and disgust, members of
Parliament listened Friday to a litany of corruption involving
leaders who rigidly maintained a spartan society for their people
while indulging in excess.
   During a nationally televised session that ran late into Friday
night, Krenz declared his party's guilt but sought to separate his
new leadership from the disgraced figures now ousted from power.
   Nevertheless, he took responsibility for the party's alleged
misuse of power in 40 years of uncontested rule.
   ``Gross political errors have been committed by my party,''
Krenz told the parliamentary session. ``As leader of the Politburo
and the Central Committee, I take responsibility for this.''
   The party newspaper Neues Deutschland commented today: ``This is
all the more painful and incomprehensible in that these people for
decades handed out to others the bread of poverty.''
   The newspaper declared the old guard Communists to be guilty of
``outright grabbing and misuse of power, corruption, coverups and
acts for which there can be no understanding and no forgiveness.''
   Heinrich Toeplitz, head of the commission investigating abuse of
power, told Parliament that Honecker and other ousted leaders spent
huge sums on hunting lodges, luxury homes and other indulgences.
   Toeplitz confirmed that accusations against the ousted leaders
disclosed before his investigative commission suggest that 100
billion marks ($54 billion) has been spirited out of the country to
Swiss bank accounts.
   The official news agency ADN said the full, 163-member Communist
Party Central Committee would meet Sunday to weigh necessary
``consequences'' on the situation in the party. It could decide to
expel Honecker and others implicated in the corruption reports.
   Toeplitz's disclosures led to demands that Foreign Trade
Minister Gerhard Beil immediately explain the whereabouts of that
money.
   ``I cannot explain this right now, and you wouldn't want me to
be able to,'' Beil contended, saying a broad investigation is
needed.
   He was stopped with shouts of ``Why not?'' and accusations that
he and others held over from the former leadership were part of the
problem.
   Former Politburo members Guenter Mittag and Guenther Kleiber
were singled out as having pocketed bribes and kickbacks for
imported goods purchased at state expense.
   Mittag already has been ousted from the party.
   Krenz pledged that past mistakes will be corrected, but
anti-Communist sentiment has been spreading rapidly in the nation
of more than 16 million.
   The city council of Plauen demanded that Krenz resign over his
alleged role in faking results of municipal elections last summer
that gave the Communists an overwhelming majority.
   Krenz is facing growing challenges to his leadership from both
the opposition and his own party because of his longtime
association with the Honecker regime.
   Krenz, Honecker's hand-picked successor, took power Oct. 18
after most of the old leaders were ousted by a wave of unrest and
the exodus of hundreds of thousands of citizens to the West.
   Since then, the leadership has instituted sweeping reform,
including lifting travel barriers and opening the Berlin Wall.
   The Communists are struggling to regain political initiative
before the Dec. 7 start of talks with the opposition on the
nation's future course. The party has also scheduled an emergency
congress for Dec. 15-17.
   At Friday's Parliament session, the Communists were stripped of
their guaranteed ``leading role'' mandated by the constitution for
40 years.
   The legislature also passed a resolution regretting East
Germany's decision to join in the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of
Czechoslovakia that crushed the short-lived ``Prague Spring''
reform era.
   The resolution offered apologies to the people of Czechoslovakia
and expressed solidarity with the process of reforms going on
there. Czechoslovakia's Prliament abolished the Communists' leading
role Wednesday.

   Vishwanath Pratap Singh, who led an
opposition coalition to defeat the Gandhi government, was sworn in
today as India's prime minister.
   Singh, 58, a former king who now heads the five-party National
Front coalition, will preside over the first minority government
India has had since it became independent from Britain 42 years ago.
   Devi Lal, 75, also of the National Front, was sworn in as deputy
prime minister.
   Singh, a poet and painter, must now name his other Cabinet
ministers and win a vote of confidence from the majority of the 525
members of Parliament's policy-making lower house. He has 30 days
to prove his support in Parliament.
   President Ramaswamy Venkataraman administered the oath of
office, and Singh smiled as the crowd in an ornate chamber of the
presidential palace burst into applause.
   ``I will do my duty,'' Singh told reporters after the 10-minute
ceremony. ``My government will be a government of the people.''
   Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, now consigned to the role of
opposition leader, was one of the first to offer congratulations.
``I wish him well,'' he said. ``I hope he completes his five-year
term.''
   Singh was Gandhi's finance and defense minister until 1987, when
he resigned amid reports his investigations into government
corruption were proving embarrassing to Gandhi.
   One of Gandhi's last acts was to free a Sikh member of
Parliament who was accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of
Gandhi's mother, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, United News of India
reported.
   The government today withdrew all charges against Simranjit
Singh Mann and four others. The shots that killed Mrs. Gandhi on
Oct. 31, 1984, were fired by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One was
shot to death by other bodyguards. The surviving gunman and a Sikh
government clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in January.
   Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto today congratulated her
new Indian counterpart. In a message to Singh released to
reporters, she said Pakistan would ``make its full contribution
towards strengthening peace and stability in our region.''
   The two nations have fought three wars since 1947 and have
thousands of troops on their borders.
   For the past two years, Singh led the efforts to unite the
country's usually disparate opposition parties into a cohesive bloc
against Gandhi's Congress Party. He is modest and vacillating, an
unlikely leader for an ideologically diverse coalition in the
world's most populous democracy.
   Singh, born to a rajah, became king of the Manda district in
northern India but gave away his small kingdom to members of the
lower castes long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971.
   He capitalized on a desire for change in attracting factions
from the left and right to support his coalition and oust the
Congress Party for only the second time since independence.
   India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru; his daughter,
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi; and her son, Rajiv, all carried the
Congress banner to power.
   The only other show of opposition unity came in 1977, when Mrs.
Gandhi was defeated. The anti-Congress coalition, however, only
lasted 29 months.
   Given the fragilility of both his formal and informal coalition,
Singh may have trouble enacting any major changes.
   His National Front is a centrist alliance, but to win a vote of
confidence in Parliament, he is dependent upon the allegiance of
far-right and far-left parties.
   The Nov. 22-26 elections gave the National Front has only 144
seats in the lower house of Parliament _ far short of the 263
majority needed to carry a motion.
   But it has pledges of support from the Hindu fundamentalist
Bharatiya Janata Party and several communist parties. Combined with
the National Front, Singh could muster 283 votes _ and probably a
few more from independents and tiny parties whose have not declared
their allegiances.
   Gandhi's Congress Party has 192 seats plus the allegiance of 17
more legislators from regional parties.
   Gandhi became prime minister after his mother's assassination in
1984, winning a four-fifths parliamentary majority. His early
promises to root out corruption started to bear fruit under a
series of tax raids conducted by Singh.
   After Singh's resignation, Swedish and Indian news reports
disclosed the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors paid as much as
$50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a $1.4 billion
weapons contract.
   Gandhi vigorously denied wrongdoing, and the charges have never
been proved, but they raised serious questions about the Gandhi's
integrity and cost him popular support.

   Rebel troops occupying a luxury hotel
today opened fire on government forces and defied President Corazon
Aquino's ultimatum to ``surrender or die.''
   Government warplanes and helicopters pounded rebel positions
near the armed forces headquarters, but troops had held their fire
in the country's financial center, saying they didn't want to
endanger Christmas shoppers.
   The government said it had defeated the coup attempt that nearly
ousted Mrs. Aquino on Friday and described today's fighting as
mopping up operations. At least 42 people have been killed and more
than 200 wounded.
   Mutineers were reported, however, to still hold an air base in
the central Philippines.
   Hundreds of rebels swarmed over the financial center of Makati,
where many foreign diplomats and businessmen live, and roamed
through affluent shopping centers. Rebels also entered the
Intercontinental Hotel and barred non-guests. At about 11 p.m.
gunfire broke out near the hotel, with snipers firing toward
loyalist troops.
   Witnesses said pro-government units of the Capital Command were
moving toward the Intercontinental and the nearby, Japanese-owned
Manila Garden Hotel with armored vehicles.
   Earlier, gunmen fired at the home of Foreign Secretary Raul
Manglapus, but he was not there. Gunmen also killed 14 soldiers and
a bystander, but police said the assailants may have been Communist
insurgents unconnected to the coup.
   The military said it captured a coup leader early today, and
another renegade officer believed to be behind the coup issued a
statement urging citizens to support the military mutiny.
   A radio station broadcast what it said was a statement by the
suspected leaders of Friday's coup attempt demanding Mrs. Aquino
resign to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government.
   Sporadic fighting continued near Camp Aguinaldo, headquarters of
the armed forces near Manila. Jets and helicopter gunships strafed
and rocketed suspected rebel positions, forcing thousands of
civilians to flee their homes.
   Air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000 pro-government
troopers near Camp Aguinaldo, mistaking them for mutineers. At
least six of the loyalist soldiers were killed and 20 wounded.
   Manila's international airport remained closed for a second day,
and all domestic flights from the capital were canceled.
   Opposition Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile, who was fired as defense
minister after a failed coup in 1986, said the situation showed the
government had lost control of most of its 160,000-member military.
   Friday's assault by rebellious members of the army and marines
was the sixth attempt to topple Mrs. Aquino since she was swept to
power in the 1986 civilian-military uprising that ousted Ferdinand
Marcos.
   The rebels attacked the presidential palace, military garrisons
and television stations, prompting Mrs. Aquino to ask for U.S. F-4
Phantom fighters to provide air cover for her counterattacking
forces. President Bush authorized the aid, and the rebels abandoned
most of the bases they had overrun.
   The opposition Nacionalista Party of Vice President Salvador
Laurel condemned the decision to call for U.S. help as a ``brazen
violation and insult'' to national sovereignty.
   A statement issued in the name of renegade Lt. Col. Gregorio
``Gringo'' Honasan also denounced Mrs. Aquino for requesting U.S.
support. The statement, delivered to news organzations and written
in ink, urged citizens to support mutineers for ``the attainment of
a genuine Filipino government.''
   The government has never publicly identified Honasan as a leader
of the latest coup attempt. But rebel sources said he was among the
key planners. Honasan, who backed a movement to reform the
military, led an August 1987 coup attempt that also nearly toppled
the government. He remains at large.
   Meanwhile, Maj. Jose Gutierrez said one of the coup leaders, Lt.
Col. Tito Legazpi, was arrested after taking part in an attack on
the Sangley Point naval air station outside Manila, which the
rebels briefly held. It was one of the sites U.S. warplanes flew
over to provide air cover to pro-government forces. U.S.
authorities said the American warplanes fired no shots.
   Legazpi was a Honasan associate wanted for the August 1987 coup
attempt. Gutierrez said four other people were captured with
Legazpi.
   Brig. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, chief of the National Capital Region
Defense Command, said he expected government forces to ``finish
off'' the rebels by the end of the day. But attacks by the
government's helicopter gunships continued near sunset.
   In the working-class district of Navotas, gunmen in a passenger
jeep fired at a Capital Command station, killing 14 soldiers and a
civilian, and fleeing with the victims' pistols. Police said the
killers may have been Communist rebels taking advantage of the
chaos caused by the coup attempt.
   During a nationally televised news conference, Mrs. Aquino said:
   ``We shall not entertain any offer to negotiate from those who
have shamelessly betrayed the solemn oath of a soldier to defend
the Constitution. We leave them two choices: surrender or die.''
   She identified 12 officers, whom she promised would be hunted
down for their role in the coup attempt.
   They included Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, commander of the
Mactan Air Base in Cebu City, 350 miles south of Manila. The base
remained under rebel control.
   In Legazpi, 220 miles southeast of Manila, mutineers agreed to
evacuate the city airport after talks with local officials and
priests. They surrendered their vehicles but were allowed to return
to their barracks with their weapons.

   Rajiv Gandhi's election debacle had two
main causes. One of them he could have controlled: His aloofness
from the people who five years ago overwhelmingly endorsed him as
their leader.
   The other he was powerless to fight: An impatient desire for
change in a developing nation, where voters think the fastest way
to improve things is to throw out the old leader and usher in a new
one.
   The legacy of a powerful family brought Gandhi to the prime
minister's office, but it was not enough to keep him there. He
repeatedly invoked the achievements of his famous forebears _ his
grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, and his mother, Indira Gandhi, both
also prime ministers.
   But Rajiv Gandhi failed to preserve the initial wave of euphoria
that propelled him into the prime minister's job after Mrs.
Gandhi's assassination.
   For only the second time in modern India's 42 years as a free
nation, Gandhi and the Congress Party failed to win a majority of
seats in Parliament's policy-making lower house, the Lok Sabha.
   The Nov. 22-26 elections failed to give anyone a decisive
mandate, but one thing was clear: The Congress Party was no longer
the overwhelming choice of the people, although it won 192 votes,
more than any other single party.
   A centrist coalition called the National Front, formed early
this year at the instigation of one-time Gandhi ally Vishwanath
Pratap Singh, captured 144 seats in the new Parliament.
   Singh managed to galvanize other opposition parties, ranging
from communists to Hindu fundamentalists, into an unwieldy but _
for the moment at least _ effective alliance. Together this motley
crew commands 283 of the 525 seats the Lok Sabha, or House of the
People.
   On Saturday, President Ramaswamy Venkataraman installed Singh as
prime minister.
   Almost until the very end, the gap between the Congress Party
and the people was so great that Gandhi and his closest aides were
unable to grasp the fact they were losing.
   ``They woke up very late. They didn't know that a campaign was
going against them since 1987. They were hopelessly out of touch,''
said Vinod Dua, a political commentator who served as co-host of
state-run television's election coverage and analysis.
   ``Even as I was on TV seeing the results, their spokesmen were
saying they were going to win,'' Dua said.
   Singh, who served as Gandhi's finance and defense minister
before his tax raids and anti-corruption investigations struck too
close to home in Congress Park ranks, resigned from the Cabinet in
the spring of 1987. A few months later he was expelled from the
Congress for ``anti-party activities.''
   Gandhi, meanwhile, failed to recognize the mounting groundswell
against him, remaining confident voters would never again trust
opposition politicians who were elected to power only once before _
for 29 months in 1977-79.
   Gandhi's mother was ousted at that time but swept back to power
in 1980 after the intervening government started bickering and fell
apart.
   Ashis Nandy, a psychologist who switched to political science
and is now an analyst at New Delhi's Center for the Study of
Developing Societies, said Gandhi also failed to meet the rising
aspirations of a Third World country of 880 million people, most of
whom have yet to cast off the shackles of poverty, disease and
illiteracy.
   ``This is a society where the middle classes have emerged as a
great voter bank,'' Nandy said, estimating their numbers at 200
million to 250 million. ``But this is still a minority. ... It's
absolutely stupid the contempt for the other Indians that this
middle class shows.''
   And the middle class _ the people who read newspapers, have
money to spend, are politically aware _ also began to tire of their
government, he said.
   Two years ago, Nandy predicted that India was headed for a
series of one-term leaders as a restless electorate looked for a
changes in its life that did not come as fast as desired.
   ``Had there not been a Mr. Singh, the Indian middle classes
would have invented him,'' Nandy wrote in an article published by
the Indian Express in August 1987. ``The moral of the story is
this: After riding through the first half of its term in style, a
regime in India today tends to lose credibility dramatically,
irrespective of the quality or nature of the leadership.''
   In an interview last week, Nandy noted that when Gandhi came to
power in 1984, he promised to root out the corruption endemic in
India. But after 2{ years, the corruption was still there. So was
the unwieldy bureaucracy, the labrythine court system, the
illiteracy rate of 64 percent.
   Gandhi, in taking credit for changes he had made, such as
loosening up the economy for investment and easing strained
relations with Pakistan, also took the fall for things that had
gone wrong or had not improved.
   At the same time, Gandhi turned his back on the bosses in the
party whose ticket had brought him to power. His confidantes and
aides included personal friends with no experience in politics.
   He reshuffled his Cabinet at least 20 times in five years, never
quite attaining a workable combination.
   One of his closest aides, who ended up managing the fraud- and
violence-marred election campaign in Gandhi's own constituency, was
a fellow pilot from the prime minister's days at Indian Airlines.
   His speech writer was a man of biting wit who sometimes peppered
the prime minister's addresses with barbs aimed at the very people
he was supposed to be honoring.
   His official spokesman was aloof and often unavailable to the
reporters who covered Gandhi's daily activities.
   And there were few places in the country where the
Cambridge-educated Gandhi and his Italian wife Sonia seemed to
belong _ certainly not in his own dirt-poor constituency of Amethi,
no matter how many electricity poles and blacktopped roads he
pumped into it.
   Fluent and confident in English, he sounded squeaky, even
hesitant, in Hindi, mispronouncing words and throwing in English
phrases. He was outclassed at his campaign rallies by local orators
who warmed up the crowds and tried to keep them from leaving before
the prime minister arrived, sometimes hours behind schedule.
   The Nehru-Gandhi dynasty brought Rajiv to power, but it didn't
keep him there. His mother suffered the same lesson in 1977, but
she managed to rebound in less than three years and hold on until
her assassination in 1984.
   Some doubt whether her son has the same stamina, even if his
nemesis Singh falters.

<HEAD>Two Senior Politicians Released from Prison to House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government released from prison two
senior politicians jailed since a June 30 military coup but is
keeping them under house arrest, a government source and their
associates said Saturday.
   An official source, who refused to be further identified,
confirmed a newspaper report on the disposition of Hassan Turabi,
head of the fundamentalist National Islamic Front, and Mohamed
Osman Mirghani, head of the centrist Democratic Unionist Party.
   The source would give no further details, but followers of the
two said they were transferred from Kober Prison in suburban
Khartoum. Several politicians remain incarcerated at the prison,
chief among them the ousted prime minister, Sadek el-Mahdi of the
Umma Party.
   The official newspaper Al-Sudan Al-Hadith said Turabi and
Mirghani were released ``after they voiced their support for the
revolution'' and the policies of the military government, which
include disbanding Sudan's 36 political parties.
   ``They have not been implicated in recent communist plots aiming
to undermine the revolution,'' the newspaper said.
   That seemed to indicate the ruling junta is implicating el-Mahdi
and Mohamed Ibrahim Nugud, secretary-general of the Communist
Party, both still in prison, in a week-long strike by doctors. The
government has blamed communists for the illegal strike.
   In addition to the parties, coup leader Lt. Gen. Omar Hassan
el-Bashir disbanded all the country's professional associations and
trade unions. He jailed most senior government officials and vowed
to try them on charges of political and economic corruption.
   Only a handful have been put on trial. The government says about
20 officials remain in detention, but informed sources put the
figure at close to 100.

<HEAD>Britain Calls on New Bulgarian Leaders To Clear Up Markov Murder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain has called on the new Bulgarian leadership
to clear up the murder of Georgi Markov, the Bulgarian defector
killed in London 11 years ago by poison injected through the tip of
an umbrella.
   Foreign Office Minister William Waldegrave told the House of
Commons on Friday that the hard-line Bulgarian government led by
Todor Zhivkov, which was toppled Nov. 10, was ``the instigator'' of
the murder.
   With a new government led by Petur Mladenov now in power, he
said, the truth about Markov's murder must be told.
   Annabel Markov, the defector's widow, was quoted Saturday as
telling The Times of London she hoped the reforms sweeping Bulgaria
and Eastern Europe would help reveal the truth about her husband's
death.
   ``I have always believed evil does not go unpunished. There is
real hope now that my husband's killer may be tracked down,'' she
was quoted as saying.
   Mrs. Markov is convinced the Bulgarian secret police have a file
on her husband, The Times said.
   Markov defected in 1969 and received death threats after
broadcasting a series of programs in 1977 attacking Bulgaria's
Communist government on the British Broadcasting Corp. world
service. He was murdered on a London street in 1978.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The panic in the eyes of a man
grabbed by riot police. Shabby East German Trabants and sleek West
German Mercedes side by side on the Kurfuerstendamm in West Berlin
after the Berlin Wall crumbled. The explosion of joy in Wenceslas
Square when the hated leaders that suppressed the Prague Spring
reforms 20 years ago had to step down.
   Those are some of the lasting images of a turbulent month that
ended an era in Eastern Europe. Millions of people demanded a say
in politics and took their fear, their courage and their joy into
the streets.
   Here are some images of that breathtaking month:
   Oct. 28: Beloved Prague, city of a thousand spires, marred again
by hundreds of riot police hounding peaceful pro-democracy
demonstrators down alleys and sidestreets.
   Wenceslas Square, a tree-lined boulevard at the heart of the
city, resembles a police camp.
   A hapless Pole tries to explain to a police officer he is on the
square by mistake. Suddenly, a riot policeman charges, slams him
against a wall and beats him in a display of the kind of violence
that kept East Europeans in check most of the last four decades.
   Nov. 3-4: In Prague again, but East Germans are the drama.
Thousands of them cram into the West German Embassy, another wave
of East Germans heading West through Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Amid the jubilation, a prescient diplomat, scarcely believing he
could be right, mutters, ``The wall has gone.''
   Nov. 5: Pomezi, a Czech village sandwiched between East and West
Germany. A chill dawn beside the dilapidated church.
   Scores of East German Trabant cars arrive at the border every
hour, carrying their occupants away from a lifetime under
communism. A Leipzig worker tells how he got caught in the Dresden
train station on the bloody night of Oct. 3-4 and saw riot police
beating back thousands trying to get aboard trains carrying East
Germans to the West.
   ``I saw them beat children,'' he says. ``That was when my wife
and I decided to leave. We were always told the DDR (East Germany)
was a state of peace.''
   Nov. 6: Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, in the rain. Another side of
repression. In court, Jan Carnogursky, a Slovak dissident, facing
up to 10 years in jail over just one article in an underground
newspaper.
   Breaking through the barrier of fear that keeps most people far
from the courtroom, a crowd of 200 gathers in the name of freedom
under the watchful eyes of uniformed police and plainclothes
officers who film them from the window.
   Later, activists talk warmly of the popular revolt in East
Germany. Soon, soon, they say, it must come to Czechoslovakia.
   Nov. 9-10: East and West Berlin. A night of delirium as the
Berlin Wall really does open. For this moment, there are no words.
Car horns honk and people scream, weep and embrace. Even hardened
West Berlin punkers have tears in their eyes.
   An East German family sharing my 2 a.m. taxi ride around a city
they haven't seen for 28 years is dumbstruck. What the mother
really couldn't believe, as we inched our way through the Trabants
around Bahnhof Zoo, was that fresh flowers were on sale in the
middle of the night.
   Nov. 13: Leipzig. First taste of the center of the East German
revolution, when 200,000 people roar across Karl Marx Square, ``We
are the people!'' Everyone is there _ young and old, religious
believers and Communists, students and workers.
   ``I'll be here until we have free elections,'' says a
70-year-old woman, with the unbending Teutonic resolve that has
powered the revolt. ``We are the generation that was most betrayed.
Maybe the children will have it better.''
   Nov. 17: Leipzig. New fears replace the old. An ethnic German
family who abandoned a prosperous farm in Romania 25 years ago sits
at home, worrying. Will the opening of the borders mean a currency
reform? ``We'll lose everything again,'' shudders the mother, two
years away from a meager East German pension with only savings in
East German marks to rely on.
   Nov. 20: Prague as people dreamed to see it ever since the day
the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' was over, crushed by Warsaw Pact troops
and tanks. More than 100,000 people are on the streets saying ``No
more!'' to police brutality and Stalinist rule.
   The procession is an explosion of Czech wit, pride and joy. A
friend leaps toward me and his wife, hugging us tight with
happiness. ``We made it,'' he cries.
   Nov. 24: Alexander Dubcek returns triumphantly to Prague after
19 years in the political wilderness. On a balcony, Dubcek bows to
the cheers, smiling broadly his hands outstretched in thanks. Then,
he reaches toward the crowd and makes a movement as if to draw the
300,000 people to his breast. The vast crowd goes mad with joy. A
day later, a photograph capturing the moment goes up in the windows
of the state news agency.
   Nov. 27. Wenceslas Square is a sea of people and national flags
and even the clocks stop for the noontime general strike, the
biggest protest against 41 years of Communist rule.
   Hundreds of thousands sway like a huge soccer crowd as they
derisively chant the name of Miroslav Stepan, the sacked Prague
party boss they blame for past police brutality.
   ``We'll be so happy if we can have back the people who had to
leave this country,'' exults a villager from north Bohemia, in
Prague for the past week to drink in the most exciting days of the
revolution. ``Everybody's expecting to spend Christmas together.''
   ``What fascinates me,'' says a woman, ``is how all of a sudden
people like each other.'' She is standing 50 feet from the spot
where, just a month ago _ an era ago _ the policeman beat the Pole.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Criticizes Party, Food Distribution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu leveled
unusual criticism at his ruling Communist Party and called for a
program to modernize the food industry and improve consumer
distribution, the state-run Agerpres news agency said Saturday.
   In recent weeks, Ceausescu has shown an increasing interest in
improving the supply of food to the population, in what observers
speculate could be an attempt to appease the population and avert
the reform demands sweeping the rest of Eastern Europe.
   Ceausescu made his remarks Friday at the first meeting of the
Politburo since he was unanimously re-elected party leader last
week at a party congress. At that congress, Ceausescu reaffirmed
his opposition to reform.
   Ceausescu, who rigidly controls government and party affairs in
Romania, admitted at Friday's meeting that ``a number of problems
emerged in the area of trade and proper supplies to the
population,'' Agerpres reported.
   Under Ceausescu's centralized command economy, Romania, once the
breadbasket of Eastern Europe, rations basic food staples such as
meat, white flour, cooking oil and bread. Fresh vegetables and
fruit are scarce, even in spring and summer.
   Ceausescu said a ``special program was required to modernize the
food and light industries, better organize the shopping network and
to meet the comsumer demands,'' Agerpres reported, adding that
Ceausescu said the shortages would be remedied within two years.
   Leveling unusual criticism at his party and its work, Ceausescu
said the Politburo and the Central Committee must be improved.
   He said it was ``essential to ... strengthen the sense of
responsibility, order and discipline for the firm application of
the laws and the party decisions,'' Agerpres reported.
   Ceausescu called on the party leadership to improve
communication with local party leaders and not take any decision
that has not been discussed ``with the whole party.''
   Although Ceausescu was unanimously re-elected party leader,
there have been signs of dissatisfaction within the party.
   Romania is a one-party state with no parliamentary opposition,
and all key government posts are held by Communists.
   The Politburo also criticized economic shortcomings, including
factories operating at a loss and failures to meet export quotas.
   At the Politburo meeting, Ceausescu assumed the mandate of
organizing an international conference of Communist parties ``as
soon as possible.''
   Ceausescu had proposed such a conference during the party
congress, leading to speculation the hard-line leader could be
seeking outside support in the face of the reform movements
elsewhere in Eastern Europe, including Poland, Hungary, East
Germany, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakia.

   The House Government Operations Committee
urged the Bush administration Saturday to clear the way for use of
federal funds for research into the infertility problem plaguing
millions of American couples.
   Government unwillingness to fund research has slowed the search
for ways to improve in vitro fertilization and other high-tech
solutions to infertility, according to the report issued Saturday.
   In vitro fertilization, in which an egg is fertilized in a
laboratory dish and then implanted in the womb, ``has changed from
a rarely used technique to an established medical procedure'' over
the last decade, the report said. But it added that ``only 6
percent of initial in vitro fertilization procedures result in the
birth of a baby.''
   About 2.4 million American couples cannot have children because
of infertility problems, the report said.
   Right to life groups have opposed infertility research because
it involves studying fertilized eggs.
   Five Republicans on the 39-member committee disagreed with the
report's recommendation, saying the issue goes beyond religion.
   They said ``hundreds of infertility clinics have been
established across the United States as part of a billion-dollar
industry serving people in need ... Given the strong private sector
involvement in fighting infertility, perhaps this is not the best
use of scarce tax dollars.''
   The decision, in any case, should be made by Congress and not
the administration, they said.
   For a decade, government funding for in vitro fertilization
research has been caught in a bureaucratic tangle involving an
Ethics Advisory Board that first gave its approval, then went out
of business and has never been reconstituted.
   The report recommended that research on in vitro fertilization
be exempt from review by the board and instead be subject to
approval by the director of the National Institutes of Health. It
also recommended that the board be reconstituted to pass judgment
on other controversial research.
   The report said that as a result of the lack of effective
treatment for infertility, many couples who cannot conceive are
``exploited'' by health care professionals who claim to be
specialists in the field but yield few successful pregnancies.
   A 1988 report by the Office of Technology Assessment said that
more than half of the 169 in vitro fertility clinics in existence
at that time had not produced a live birth but patients were not
told of their lack of success.
   Patients pay an average of $9,376 for two in vitro fertilization
attempts, the report said. Additionally, because this is a method
of last resort, these patients have already spent an average
$13,000 on previous infertility treatments, it said.
   Most in vitro clinics have waiting lists of patients, some as
long as one to two years, the report said.
   The report also recommended an increase in federal funding to
prevent sexually transmitted diseases that cause infertility. The
Centers for Disease Control estimates that 125,000 cases of
infertility related to sexually transmitted diseases occur every
year. CDC also estimates that about half of these women want to
have children.
   The report is based on an investigation by the human resources
and intergovernmental relations subcommittee, which is chaired by
Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., and was issued by the House Government
Operations Committee.

   Israeli-backed militia gunners shelled
the southern market town of Nabatiyeh on Saturday, killing three
Shiite Moslem people and wounding nine, police reported.
   A police spokesman said the casualties occurred during a
three-hour barrage by gunners of the Israeli-allied South Lebanon
Army militia in the crowded market town, which has a population of
about 100,000.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said the attack started after fighters of the mainstream Shiite
Amal militia ambushed an SLA squad on a road east of Nabatiyeh.
   ``SLA casualties could not be determined, but judging by the
retaliatory artillery barrage, it seems they've had some
fatalities,'' the spokesman said.
   The 2,500-strong SLA, backed by Israeli troops, patrols a narrow
strip of south Lebanon referred to by the Jewish state as the
security zone.
   Israel carved out the 328-square-mile zone when it withdrew the
bulk of its invading army from south Lebanon in the summer of 1985,
ending a three-year occupation of the region.
   The zone serves as a buffer against cross-border guerrilla
infiltrations into northern Israel.

   The almost $1 billion American aid program for
Poland and Hungary is spawning a whole new industry as government
officials and private analysts assess opportunities in the Eastern
bloc.
   ``It's really exciting,'' said Jim Flanigan, a spokesman for the
Peace Corps which is preparing to send its first volunteers to
Europe in 20 years.
   Perhaps 65 people _ mainly English teachers _ will go to Hungary
next summer and Poland is expected to get volunteers as well.
   The Peace Corps is one of many agencies with a stake in the
``Support for East European Democracy Act'' passed by Congress and
signed last week by President Bush. The package provides $938
million in benefits over three years, with Poland receiving the
lion's share.
   The Agriculture Department will provide food aid and the
Treasury Department has $200 million earmarked for economic
stabilization.
   The Export-Import Bank will extend credit to exporters, the
Agency for International Development will set up a scholarship
program and the Energy Department will help retrofit a commercial
powerplant in Krakow. The Environmental Protection Agency will work
to improve water quality in that city and the Labor Department will
help Poles establish job training programs.
   Perhaps the most novel parts of the aid program are the
``enterprise funds,'' one for Poland and another for Hungary.
   The non-profit funds, to be run by private citizens, will make
loans, grants and guarantees to small businesses and agricultural
units. Poland's fund gets $45 million next year, Hungary's $5
million.
   With the Iron Curtain in shreds, businessmen, consultants,
bankers and academics are hustling to learn more about what the
future holds.
   ``We've had lots of calls, lots of interest,'' said Myra Leonard
of the Polish American Congress, a group that represents more than
8 million Americans of Polish descent. She said callers included
would-be investors and consultants with an eye to conducting
management seminars.
   One of America's best-known Polish-Americans, former national
security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski, has been bombarded by callers
seeking his views, according to his secretary.
   So eager are people to bone up on the situation that a seminar
at the conservative Heritage Foundation, a think tank, on ``What
are U.S. Interests Behind the Crumbling Iron Curtain'' attracted a
standing-room only crowd.
   The next day, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci chaired a
panel discussion on business opportunities in Eastern European at a
conference put on by the American Foreign Service Association.
   At the Agency for International Development, the lead agency for
assistance, officials are still working on details of how to
operate the first aid program in European countries with state
economies.
   ``We're still getting ourselves organized,'' said one AID
official.
   The course to be followed by the United States will be
determined in part by the recommendations of a presidential
delegation that returns to the United States after spending five
days in Poland this weekend.
   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter headed the delegation
which included Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Labor Secretary
Elizabeth Dole and AFL-CIO chief Lane Kirkland.
   While U.S. government aid is important, Gregory Flynn, an expert
of Eastern European affairs at the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, said ``government money is not going to be a
major force'' in redevelopment.
   More important, he said, will be the willingness of businessmen
to make long-term investments.
   Moreover, he said the Europeans, particularly the Germans and
the Italians, have an edge in doing business in the Eastern Bloc
countries because they have experiences and contacts in the area.

<HEAD>Moslem Girls Decide to Take Off Controversial Scarves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CREIL, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Moslem girls whose insistence on
wearing Islamic scarves to school kicked off a national debate
announced Saturday that they would take off the controversial
headgear in class.
   The 13- and 14-year-old sisters, Fatima and Leila Achaboun, said
they would bow to the request by their principal at Gabriel-Havez
College in the northern Paris suburb of Creil and take off their
``hijabs.''
   They gave no explanation of their decision to lower the hijabs
to their shoulders while in the classroom. A third student in
Creil, 15-year-old Samira Saidani, continues to refuse to abide by
the school's request.
   Wearing the hijab, which covers the hair, ears and neck, has
stirred debate over the separation of church and state in France.
   The principle of secularity in public schools has been the law
in France since the Roman Catholic Church was officially separated
from the state in 1905.
   The controversy began in Creil when the school principal, Ernest
Chenieres, applied the 1937 law prohibiting all religious symbols
in school and denied the three girls the right to attend class
until they removed the scarves. The girls refused.
   Similar cases arose in other French cities, and the arguments
became linked to the issue of immigration, particularly attitudes
toward immigrants from Moslem countries in North Africa.
   On Monday, the Council of State ruled that the girls could wear
the religous headgear if it did not cause disruptions. The ruling
by the council, France's highest administrative authority, left the
decision up to school authorities to judge on a case-by-case basis.

<HEAD>Tongue-in-Cheek Statisticians Offer Stuff for the Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sometime in the future, when yet-unborn
statisticians open a time capsule in Alexandria, Va., they will
confront a slick wooden ruler-like stick coated with tiny numbers
and lines.
   It is a slide rule, as anyone who had not made it to high school
physics or chemistry by, say, the mid-1960s might not know.
   A slide rule, says the Encyclopedia Americana, is ``a mechanical
device for making rapid mathematical calculations accurate to
several significant figures.''
   To the American Statistical Association, marking its 150th
anniversary, the slide rule was the perfect mathematical relic to
symbolize the past. A fancy solar calculator was encapsuled to
represent the present and a computer chip to stand for the future.
   The slide rule, invented in the 1620s or 1630s by an English
mathematician, was nearly universally replaced by the calculator
around 20 years ago. Has society lost something in the transition?
   ``No,'' says William Eddy, professor of statistics at
Pittsburgh's Carnegie-Mellon University. ``Slide rules are
inherently slower and more painful to use. They're less accurate,
too, because they're analog as opposed to digital. Of all the
things in the capsule, it is the least statistical.''
   Eddy was a member of the committee that chose what went into the
time capsule, which was implanted in a column in the ASA's
headquarters last week in Alexandria, a Washington suburb. The
capsule is to be opened in 50 years or a century _ that decision to
be left to the statisticians of the future.
   The 15,000-member organization believes itself to be the
country's oldest national professional association. Its members
have included nurse Florence Nightingale, telephone inventor
Alexander Graham Bell, steelmaker Andrew Carnegie and American
president Martin Van Buren.
   The committee conferred by mail and phone and spent a day last
August in deliberations to select the one cubic foot of objects
that went into the time capsule.
   Also encapsuled: the transcript of a speech by former Sen.
William Proxmire, D-Wis., to the ASA's meeting last summer; a
15-minute videotape on ``What Is Statistics?''; the front section
of last Monday's New York Times; a copy of an 1875 letter from Ms.
Nightingale together with ``An Annual Sanitation Report'' from
India that she sent along; a yellow and a blue ASA T-shirt; and,
``to prove statisticians have a sense of humor,'' says Eddy, a
Batman button.
   A few lottery tickets were thrown in too.
   ``Lotteries hold a great fascination for statisticians,'' Eddy
said, ``because they can't figure out why people play them, given
the odds.''

   Police were questioning three suspected
Basque terrorists Saturday after discovering a cache of explosives
in the wine cellar of a building near the Spanish border, Agence
France-Presse reported.
   About 50 police raided the apartment building in Anglet, west of
Bayonne, on Friday morning and found 18 rocket launchers and 190
kilograms of explosives commonly used by the Basque separatist
organization ETA, the French news agency said.
   ETA, which stands for Basque Homeland and Liberty in the Basque
language, is fighting for autonomy for the three-province Basque
region in northern Spain.
   AFP said five people were initially detained in connection with
Friday's discovery but two were later released. It said no charges
had been filed.

   President Bush and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev began a storm-tossed summit today with five hours of
talks, and the White House said afterward the two men worked in a
``spirit of forward-looking cooperation.''
   The president and his Soviet counterpart ``recognized that
economic and political challenges were ahead for Eastern Europe,
and vowed to consider the opportunities presented with sensitivity
and firm initiative,'' said the statement issued by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   High winds and rough seas forced the two men to scrap plans to
talk aboard a Soviet naval vessel anchored off-shore, opting
instead for a session on a docked Soviet cruise liner that served
as Gorbachev's headquarters for the two-day summit.
   Bush returned to his headquarters on the USS Belknap following
the initial sessions. The White House said an afternoon round of
talks were put on hold because of the bad weather, which kept Bush
from immediately leaving the Belknap.
   The White House said they talked ``almost continuously'' for
nearly five hours, including a session with aides and a session
with only note-takers, and then continued their talks over lunch.
   ``President Bush spoke for more than an hour to open the
meeting, laying out more than a dozen ideas for economic and
political progress in U.S.-Soviet relations,'' the statement said.
   ``The discussion ranged from the economic situation in Eastern
Europe to arms control and Central America. Chairman Gorbachev
spoke at length of perestroika and the goals of his reform
program,'' it said.
   The two men also arranged to have an afternoon of talks before
getting together for dinner. The summit concludes on Sunday.
   The White House said the opening talks included a `'very
productive, informal and substantive meeting.''
   ``The meetings were sparked by a spirit of forward-looking
cooperation during these increasingly changing times,'' it said.
   The White House said the discussion ranged from the economic
situation in Eastern Europe to arms control and Central America.
``Chairman Gorbachev spoke at length of perestroika and the goals
of his reform program,'' it said.
   ``The president emphasized his support for the success of
perestroika. He set forth his ideas as a broad framework for
actions that would help the two nations work together for peace and
prosperity,'' it said.
   The two leaders, both in an affable mood, met aboard the
25,000-ton Maxim Gorky, which is Gorbachev's headquarters for the
weekend summit, to begin nearly 12 hours of scheduled talks that
could bring down the curtain on the Cold War.
   ``I think we've got a very good beginning of the dialogue ... an
excellent beginning,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
reporters after Bush and Gorbachev completed their initial
three-hour session.
   Senior Soviet officials said Gorbachev wants the summit to
produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties on reducing
strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in central Europe
and chemical weapons.
   These officials, who spoke only on condition they not be
identified, said Gorbachev will convene a meeting of Warsaw Pact
leaders in Moscow on Monday to discuss the results of the two-day
summit. Bush will spend Monday briefing allied leaders at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
   Gorbachev and Bush were smiling and in high spirits as they
clasped hands across a long rectangular table, measuring barely a
yard across.
   ``It's so narrow that if we don't have enough arguments, we'll
kick each other,'' Gorbachev told Bush.
   Asked by reporters if they would reach any agreements, Gorbachev
replied, `` da, da (yes, yes).'' Agreement on what? he was asked.
``Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning ``a lot of things.''
   When Bush was asked the same question, the president echoed
Gorbachev. ``Mnogovo,'' he said.
   The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like
room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and
nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck.
   They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on
either side.
   Arms control, East-West trade and the breathtaking democratic
reforms sweeping communist Eastern Europe dominated the agenda for
the Bush-Gorbachev talks. Both leaders said they hoped their
discussions would strengthen long-term prospects for world peace
and European unity.
   Gorbachev, asked if he would discuss fast-moving political
changes in East Europe, replied, ``We'll be discussing everything,
including that.''
   The senior Soviet sources said Gorbachev wants a Stategic Arms
Reduction Treaty ready for signing at his next planned summit
meeting with Bush in Washington next spring or early summer.
   They said the Soviet leader also is seeking a Bush commitment to
attend a 35-nation summit at the end of 1990 to sign a separate
accord sharply reducing U.S. and Soviet troops in central Europe.
   The original site for the first summit session was the Soviet
guided missile cruiser Slava, anchored near the Belknap in this
harbor, but White House officials said the meeting was shifted to
the Maxim Gorky because gale-force winds would have made launch
transfers treacherous.
   The White House said ``there was no danger to anyone aboard
Belknap as a result of the high winds.''
   The 630-foot Maxim Gorky is about twice as large as the Slava in
total tonnage. Built 20 years ago in West Germany, it was sold to
the Soviet Union in 1974 and is used frequently for cruises through
the North Sea and Scandanavian waters. The vessel was repaired
after it rammed an iceberg off Norway last June with 900 people
aboard, but there were no injuries.
   The two leaders are scheduled to meet Sunday aboard the Belknap,
flagship of the U.S. Sixth Fleet which is anchored about 400 yards
from the Slava.

<HEAD>Five Years Later, Bhopal Survivors Still Waiting for Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BHARAT DESAI</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BHOPAL, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fourteen-year-old Mamta, who lost her
parents and five brothers and sisters in the deadly gas leak at
Union Carbide's pesticide plant here, tried to commit suicide two
weeks ago by setting fire to her house.
   She was rescued by neighbors and sent to an orphanage in another
town.
   Many of the more than 20,000 survivors of the world's worst
industrial accident share Mamta's despair, and five years later
they still have not been compensated.
   They have trouble finding work because their eyes and lungs were
damaged by exposure to the white cloud of methyl isocyanate that
passed over their crowded shantytowns on Dec. 3, 1984.
   Instead, they wait for their shares of the $470 million the
U.S.-based multinational Union Carbide gave the Indian government
in ``full and final compensation'' of the disaster that has killed
at least 3,598 people.
   The government alleged the leak was the result of negligence by
Union Carbide and sued it for $3 billion. Union Carbide said the
leak was sabotage by a disgruntled employee.
   India's Supreme Court ultimately approved Union Carbide's $470
million compensation, but many survivors bitterly contest the
settlement as much too small.
   The government's right to agree to the settlement as the sole
representative of the survivors has been challenged, delaying
disbursement of most of the money.
   Meanwhile, the deaths continue. At least 269 people have died in
the past year of ailments blamed on exposure to the gas. S.R.
Satyam, the Madhya Pradesh state government's commissioner for gas
relief, says 1,960 deaths await investigation.
   The government still has not reviewed all of the approximately
570,000 compensation claims.
   Some of the seekers were hundreds of miles from Bhopal at the
time of the leak but say they suffered mental anguish worrying
about the fates of loved ones.
   A survey by a team of doctors found that 70 percent of the
people who inhaled the gas still suffer from severe respiratory
disorders, chronic eye diseases, cataracts, menstrual problems and
neurological disorders.
   The government's figures of the permanantly disabled are
``grossly underestimated,'' the team's spokesman, Dr. Nishith
Vohra, told reporters Friday in New Delhi.
   Dr. Gurbaksh Rai Dheer, Bhopal's chief medical officer, said
there is no known treatment for the gas. ``Our treatment is
symptomatic. This has helped some of the victims to recover, but
many are showing no signs of improvement,'' he said.
   He said psychological disorders resulting from trauma are also
common.
   Satyam cites Mamta, who tried to burn herself to death by
setting fire to the family home.
   Her brother, Sunil Vishwakarma, 17, now sits brooding with his
dog, Moti, in the tin-roofed house, across the road from the closed
Union Carbide plant.
   The Indian government has spent millions of rupees on relief and
rehabilitation, but survivors say the measures are inadequate.
   ``The government began with dole of money, grains and milk,''
said Shankarlal Shrivastava, a grocer. But now, all assistance has
stopped, he said.
   ``We cannot exert ourselves because of breathing problems, and
it is difficult to find a job suited to our physical capability,''
he said.
   Activist groups call the $470 million settlement ``grossly
inadequate'' and organized demonstrations for more compensation
after it was announced.
   Protests have become rare. ``It is becoming increasingly clear
that the amount will not be raised any further,'' said Alok Pratap
Singh, who heads the Poisonous Gas Episode Struggle Front.
   Satinath Sarangi of the Bhopal Group for Information and Action
said the low compensation was offered because multinational
companies feel ``life in the Third World (is) cheap.''
   ``All we want now is that the charges of homicide against the
company should not be dropped and its officials should be
prosecuted,'' he said.
   ``How can we allow this killer company to be exonerated from the
charge of killing our family members and making our lives
miserable,'' said Razia Bee, 40, whose husband and two daughters
died in the gas leak.
   ``I just feel like dropping a bomb on the factory, but I fear
there are still poisonous gases inside,'' she said.
   Narmada Bai Rajoria, another widow, said the victims want jobs,
not alms. She said she returned an early, stopgap award of $625,
which was given by the government as compensation for her husband's
death.
   ``I want employment so that I can support my family and live
with dignity,'' Mrs. Rajoria said.

   Winds gusting to 48 miles per hour
and roiling seas moved the first summit session between President
Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev to a Soviet luxury
liner and delayed the second round of meetings.
   Bush and Gorbachev met this morning on the 25,000-ton liner
Maxim Gorky after gale-force winds caused both the Soviet ship
Slava, the original site of today's meeting, and the USS Belknap to
drag their anchors.
   Bush returned to Belknap after five hours of talks and was to
return to the Gorky for an afternoon summit session. But the White
House said the weather forced a delay in that second session.
   This morning, the White House issued a statement saying that the
winds, which built overnight, ``make it difficult to disembark from
launches at the Slava and the Belknap. Therefore, this morning's
meeting has been shifted to the Soviet ship Gorky at anchor at
Malta.''
   Maltese meteorologist Spiro Agius said the winds should abate by
Sunday, the final day of the summit. ``It will definitely be
improving tomorrow,'' he said.
   Despite a little pitching from the heavy seas, the winds did not
present a danger to anyone on the Belknap, Bush's headquarters for
the summit and the site of his wrap-up meeting on Sunday with
Gorbachev, the White House statement said.
   In fact, Bush, who slept aboard the Belknap Friday night, said
on the Gorky that he was ``feeling pretty good.'' Asked how he
slept, he said, ``fine, just fine...piece of cake.''
   The stormy conditions prompted Raisa Gorbachev to delay a
sightseeing tour, but she later went ahead with the visit,
including an inspection of a 16th-century cathedral.
   ``This is the type of weather that shipwrecked Saint Paul on
these rocks. We usually have this in February,'' Joe Cassar,
Maltese minister for housing, told a rain-soaked crowd that had
gathered to see the Soviet leader's wife at Santa Lucia, a suburb
of Valletta, the capital city.
   Both the 12,500-ton Slava and 8,600-ton Belknap are anchored in
the middle of the Bay, while the much larger Gorky, which has been
Gorbachev's base during his time in Malta, is tied up at a pier.
   The high winds were blowing from the northeast. Marsaxlokk Bay,
a large indentation in the southeast coast of Malta, is exposed to
winds from easterly directions.
   The hasty change in plans for the superpower meeting in the
Mediterranean came as the tiny wind-whipped island nation was as
ready as it would ever be for its weekend in the international
limelight.
   Malta was hoping the summit would boost attention for the
island, but the bad weather probably was not the type of publicity
the Maltese had in mind.
   On shore, red Soviet flags flapped in the stiff breeze.
   On Friday, street salesmen were out in force to hawk
commemorative T-shirts and other souvenir and residents strolled to
the edge of Marsaxlokk Bay for a look at the two anchored warships.
   ``This may help your tourism,'' Bush had told Prime Minister
Edward Fenech-Adami on Friday following his arrival from Washington.
   ``It will probably bring positive economic effects,'' said a
21-year-old woman who identified herself only as Dorothy, assessing
the summit's meaning for the 350,000 Maltese.
   She and two companions had come out Friday night for a glimpse
of the warships. ``We were bored,'' she admitted.
   On the other side of the bay, in the fishing village of
Birzebuga, Albert Roberts led a group of Labor Party workers
preparing for a peace demonstration timed to coincide with the
summit, decorating a float that will be a part of a 60-piece parade
on Saturday.
   ``Give peace a chance,'' said signs on the float in both English
and Russian.
   Although Bush and Gorbachev were unlikely to see the parade
itself, Roberts said: ``Malta is ready to show to the world that we
hope for peace.''
   Traffic circles and seaside roads were decorated with Soviet and
U.S. flags, and Maltese security forces stood through the night in
clumps of two or three on streets overlooking the harbor.
   Malta's entire 1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police
officers have been assigned to the summit security job. Roadblocks
and checkpoints made it hard to get around on the narrow island
roads, although it seemed anyone with a good story could get waved
through.
   Although thousands of Maltese had skipped work or classes to
catch a glimpse of Bush's arrival early Friday, most were already
in bed by the time Gorbachev's Il-62 rolled up to the airport
gangway at 11 p.m. sharp during a gentle mist.
   The prime minister and his cabinet broke from their line and
walked over to the plane's gangplank as Sgt. Emmanuel Gatt, a
32-veteran of the Maltese army, and two other soldiers rolled out a
red carpet for Gorbachev and his wife Raisa, who walked arm-in-arm
down the steps.
   After a 21-gun salute, a Maltese armed forces band in dark blue
uniforms with red piping on their pants played the Soviet and
Maltese national anthems.
   Gorbachev thanked Malta for preparing the summit for him and
President Bush.
   ``Although we will be meeting on naval ships, I would like to
assure you that we will be speaking about peace, about how we can
work for a better world,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Chin Peng, one of the world's
longest-surviving and most secretive Communist guerrilla leaders,
laid down his arms Saturday after a half-century of jungle warfare.
   And the insurgency he started with the killing of three British
rubber planters 41 years ago in what is now Malaysia has formally
ended in a southern Thailand city known more for its sex trade than
politics.
   Now in his late 60s, Chin Peng signed an agreement ending the
armed struggle of the Communist Party of Malaya, which has within
its much-withered ranks some 1,200 weary jungle fighters who are to
return to civilian life.
   The Communists agreed to lay down their arms and pledged loyalty
to king and country. Thailand and Malaysia promised to ensure their
fair treatment.
   The signing ceremony at Hat Yai, a bustling center attracting
thousands of tourists and smuggled goods from nearby Malaysia,
marked another failure of communist effort around the world.
   Chin Peng called the agreements ``consistent with the current
historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving
for peace and democracy.''
   Chin Peng's future appears uncertain. Some Malaysian officials
have expressed suspicion of his motives, and the country appears
unwilling to accept ex-guerrillas once officially known as CTs, or
Communist Terrorists, who sought power through the barrel of a gun.
   Dubbed ``the world's senior surviving guerrilla'' by one Western
expert, Chin Peng belongs to a now all but vanished breed who
fought to create a Marxist-Leninist order following the chaos of
World War II.
   In World War II, the young Chin Peng was a courageous,
behind-enemy-lines fighter against the Japanese, learning guerrilla
tactics from his British comrades-at-arms in the jungles of Malaya,
formerly a British colony and now a part of Malaysia. He also
became a committed Communist.
   ``Unusual ability, an incisive brain, reliable, a frank man
(who) possessed marked courage, and commanded the natural respect
of men without fuss or formality,'' one of the British officers,
John Davis, said of him.
   He was awarded the Order of the British Empire after the war.
Soon, however, he became secretary-general of the Communist Party.
   He was born in 1920 or 1922 in Malaya's Perak State of Chinese
parents who immigrated to Malaya shortly before his birth. His
father made a good living selling and repairing bicycles and sent
his son to local English schools where he excelled.
   The Chinese were in many respects an underprivileged class in
British-ruled Malaya, and for a number of young people among them,
communism represented social justice and a shortcut to power and
status.
   In 1948 the party decided to wage armed struggle, the opening
volleys of which were fired June 16 when guerrillas walked into two
rubber plantations in northern Malaya and methodically executed
three planters.
   The country was plunged into 12 years of violence known as the
Malayan Emergency. It became one of the few successful efforts by a
government to stamp out a communist insurgency within its borders.
Later, in the Vietnam War, the U.S. government sought advice from
some of the architects of the victory, but conditions were far
different in America's war.
   At the height of the Emergency, some 70,000 British, Australian,
New Zealand, Fijian, Gurkha and other British Commonwealth troops
fought about 10,000 guerrillas. More than 10,000 fighters and
civilians died between 1948 and 1960.
   Although the casualties were relatively light, the jungle
fighting was agonizing and the communist attacks vicious. Tens of
thousands of often innocent Chinese were uprooted as a result of
the ultimately successful strategy to separate the guerrillas from
all sources of support.
   Clearly losing, Chin Peng emerged from the jungle in 1955 to
negotiate with Malayan officials at a schoolhouse near the
Thai-Malay border.
   Tunku Abdul Rahman, shortly to become prime minister of an
independent Malaysia, insisted on surrender and an amnesty. But
Chin Peng wanted his party included in a coalition government and
the talks broke down.
   ``The amnesty means surrender, surrender means humiliation. We
will not accept surrender at any time,'' Chin Peng said. ``If you
demand our surrender, we would prefer to fight to the last man.''
   Davis, his wartime friend, was present and the two men shook
hands before Chin Peng disappeared into the jungle. It was the last
time he was seen by the non-communist world until his recent
emergence in Thailand, which brokered the agreement.
   Although the Emergency was declared over in 1960, communist
attacks continued. Their last major raids were in the mid-1970s,
when guerrillas blew up the National War Memorial in Kuala Lumpur.
Thereafter, communist strength was sapped through joint
Thai-Malaysian military operations and a Thai amnesty that saw mass
surrenders in recent years.
   Chin Peng reportedly spent most of his time in China, making
periodic trips to the rugged Thai-Malaysian border where the
Malayan Communists were largely concentrated. There also were
reports of his death.
   Chin Peng became a legendary figure, the ruthlessness of his
movement mingling with the personal respect he had elicited from
his enemies.
   C.C. Too, the onetime Malaysian psychological warfare chief who
matched wits with him, described Chin Peng in a 1976 interview as
having ``a scholarly, monastic quality. When he talked and acted,
it was with dignity.
   ``If there is a Communist who can be called gentlemanly it was
Chin Peng,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Democratic Group Claims Inspiration from Hart, McCarthy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN L. HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A fledgling faction of the Democratic Party is
organizing under the title ``New Democrats'' with plans to promote
liberal candidates in coming elections.
   The group claims the support of former presidential candidates
Eugene McCarthy and Gary Hart in its self-declared mission of
wresting control of the party from ``political managers,
technocrats and media consultants.''
   McCarthy, whose early success in the 1968 Democratic primaries
led President Lyndon B. Johnson to abandon his re-election bid, has
accepted the position of director of the New Democrats' steering
committee.
   He said he hopes the group can help counter the notion that
wearing a liberal tag is a political liability.
   Democrats, not the Republicans, must shoulder the blame for
liberalism's evolution into the dreaded ``L word'' of the last
presidential campaign, the former Minnesota senator said in an
interview.
   ``Gradually the word began to take on the characteristic of a
noun. At that point it was subject to all kinds of attacks by the
conservatives,'' McCarthy said.
   ``But then in the 80s, liberals began to attack liberalism and
admit that it had these serious faults. I think (New York Mayor Ed)
Koch said he was a sane liberal _ the implication being that all
other liberals were insane.''
   Hart, a former Colorado senator and frontrunner in the 1988
presidential campaign until a furor over his private life sabotaged
his standing, has given his blessing to the movement but declined a
leadership position, the New Democrats say.
   The group's founder, Jesse Yoder, is a philosophy professor at
the University of Lowell in Massachusetts who worked in McCarthy's
1968 campaign. He said the group plans to field its first
candidates for political office in 1990, including congressional
races.
   Philadelphia-area political activist and sports handicapper
Darcy Richardson said he intends in January to become the first
congressional candidate to run as a New Democrat.
   ``I think the New Democrats label will draw some attention.
It'll make people look twice and at least give us a hearing,'' said
Richardson, who has his eye set on Pennsylvania's 13th
congressional district seat currently held by Republican Lawrence
Coughlin.
   The New Democrats will try to unite the Woodstock generation
with the younger one politically weaned on Reaganomics, Yoder said.
   The group's positions include rolling back tax breaks for the
wealthy, immediate reductions in automotive and industrial
pollution levels, and higher pay for teachers.
   ``People who were around in '68 are now the decision makers
today and I think those are the people we will appeal to, but of
course we'll also be appealing to new people _ the students and
others within the party who see the merit of emphasizing the
envirnment, the economy and education,'' Yoder said.
   James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies at American University, is among the skeptics
who say the new group is unlikely to ever put a Democrat in the
White House.
   Any faction trying to rescue the Democratic Party should be
appealing to southern conservatives such as Sens. Charles Robb of
Virginia and Sam Nunn of Georgia, not liberals, he said.
   ``They will not be able to pull from the South. If you cannot
pull from the South, you lose the election,'' Thurber said.

   Nobel laureate Mother Teresa was doing
fine Saturday and resting comfortably a day after a pacemaker was
implanted to restore normalcy in her heartbeats, hospital officials
said.
   There was no recurrence of the mild bout of fever she suffered
Friday.
   ``Mother Teresa is cheerful and her general condition is good,''
a statement issued by the Woodlands Nursing Home hospital said.
   The 79-year-old Roman Catholic nun, who suffered a heart attack
in September, was admitted Wednesday to Woodlands Nursing Home.
   Hundreds of nuns of Missionaries of Charity, the headquarters of
her worldwide charity that cares for the destitute and the dying on
six continents, prayed for her recovery Saturday.
   The Yugoslav-born nun founded the charity in October 1959 in an
abandoned hostel donated by the city of Calcutta. The order, which
was formally recognized by the Vatican in 1965, expanded and now
has 3,000 nuns working in 87 countries.
   Mother Teresa won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work.

<HEAD>Senate Ethics Counsel Known as Tough But Fair</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett, who has
won acquittals for many white collar defendants, is known as a
tough but fair negotiator with a quick grasp of legal issues.
   The Senate may have had that reputation in mind when it chose
the 50-year-old Bennett to look into the case of five senators
under fire for their role in the $2 billion Lincoln Savings and
Loan controversy.
   Bennett, whose office overlooks Pennsylvania Avenue five blocks
from the White House, was chosen by the Senate Select Committee on
Ethics as its special counsel in the case of the so-called
``Keating Five.''
   He will provide legal advice on whether any or all of the five
senators violated the rules when they met with banking regulators
on behalf of wealthy campaign donor Charles H. Keating Jr. in 1987.
At the time, Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.
was collapsing and its failure is now expected to cost taxpayers $2
billion.
   The brother of national drug policy coordinator William Bennett,
stocky, animated Bob Bennett is described by fellow lawyers as a
tough negotiator who can quickly grasp complex legal issues.
   ``If I were one of the senators and had done nothing wrong, I
wouldn't worry,'' said attorney E. Lawrence Barcella Jr. ``But if I
were one of the senators and had something to worry about, I'd be
scared to death.''
   Bennett's role is to advise the committee on whether to launch a
formal investigation of the five: Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald
W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz.;
and Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.
   Keating had contributed some $1.3 million to the senators'
campaigns and political causes.
   Bennett's role could become even more powerful if the panel
proceeds with a full-scale investigation and invites him to remain.
   For Bennett, that would not be a first-time experience. He was
the panel's counsel in the Abscam bribery case against former Sen.
Harrison A. Williams Jr., D-N.J. Williams resigned in 1982.
   In his report, Bennett said the senator's behavior was
``illegal, corrupt and unethical.''
   William Bennett, four years younger than his brother, said,
``When Bob got you in a headlock, that was it _ you didn't get out.
The thing is concentration. His brain is like a radar screen. When
Bob sizes up the topic, nothing interferes.''
   The president's drug coordinator recalls that he once was
roughed up by a neighborhood bully when he was about five.
   ``Bob went to the kid's house and when the mother answered the
door, he was very polite,'' William Bennett said. ``But when the
boy came to the door, Bob said, `This is for hitting my brother. He
decked him in the doorway. That's classic Bob.''
   Bennett's whose 55-member law firm has one of the nation's
largest law practices representing white collar defendants.
   Current and former clients include former Navy Secretary John F.
Lehman Jr.; four defense contractors in the Pentagon bribery
scandal known as Operation Ill Wind and the Boeing Co.
   Joseph E. diGenova, the former U.S. attorney for the District of
Columbia, praised Bennett's appointment.
   ``He can look at something and smell it and know when
something's wrong,'' said DiGenova. ``He's the kind of guy who has
judgment. He knows when enough is enough.''

<HEAD>Police Close Art Show Sponsored by Foreign Journalists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ABRAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police Saturday shut down an exhibition of
paintings by young Chinese artists sponsored by foreign
journalists, saying the exhibitors failed to obtain permission from
the government.
   Police also said the one-day show was ``activity incompatible
with your status as journalists,'' said Jaime Florcruz, president
of the Foreign Correspondents Club of Beijing.
   Florcruz, a reporter for Time magazine, said three uniformed
police officers and a plainclothes officer gave the artists 40
minutes to remove their oil paintings from a room at the Great Wall
Sheraton, a U.S.-China joint venture hotel.
   The Correspondents Club was allowed to hold a show in 1988 at
the hotel as a way for journalists to meet young artists.
   However, freedom of expression for artists, writers and others
has been strictly limited since the June crackdown on the
pro-democracy movement here.
   ``Everyone is just flexing their muscles during martial law,''
said Meg Maggio, also a Time staffer and the organizer of
Saturday's exhibition of 40 works by six artists.
   She said police ``never looked at the paintings.'' Many were
avant-garde or abstract but did not appear to carry political
messages.
   Ms. Maggio said she was aware that under martial law, in effect
in Beijing since May, the club needed authorization for the
exhibit. But, she said, ``there is no procedure. We didn't know how
to get permission.''
   Florcruz said he called the Beijing Cultural Bureau on Friday
but was not told how to obtain the needed authorization.
   He said he told police the paintings were not for sale and there
would be no commercial activity at the exhibit. The police
responded, ``There's no room for discussion,'' he said.
   In November, the Ministry of Culture forced the French Embassy
to cancel a nine-day exhibit of the works of a 28-year-old Chinese
artist.
   ``We were told that foreign embassies are not allowed to sponsor
exhibitions by artists _ whether singers, painters, whatever,'' a
French Embassy official said on condition of anonymity.
   Culture Ministry officials told French diplomats at the time
that the ministry planned to distribute a circular informing
embassies of the policy. Several embassies said they had not
received such a notice.
   Since the military marched on Beijing June 3-4 and crushed the
student-led pro-democracy movement, writers have been told they
must discard ``bourgeois liberal tendencies'' and produce works in
support of socialist ideas.
   Film directors who had done works about the darker aspects of
life in China have stopped directing or have returned to
government-sanctioned films.
   Most of the young artists who a year ago astonished the nation
with the first public shows of nude and avant-garde works have gone
underground. Artists can earn little or no money for their works
domestically and those who once sought foreign buyers have been
censured.
   The official China Daily on Saturday criticized some art stores
and individuals who ``manage artwork sales without licenses, doing
illicit trade in black markets or profiteering through underground
channels.''

   President Bush, stranded by high
winds and choppy seas aboard an American naval cruiser, canceled
his second round of summit talks and a dinner Saturday with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, White House officials announced.
   The summit was to resume on Sunday.
   Putting a sunny spin on a rain splattered day, the White House
said, ``We feel this has been a very productive day in terms of the
five-hour meeting this morning.'' There was no immediate word from
the Soviet delegation.
   Bush and Gorbachev had held five hours of talks earlier in the
day before Bush returned to his ship to prepare for the second
round and the dinner, which originally was supposed to have been
aboard the president's command ship, the Belknap.
   Bush was unable to cross 500 yards of roiling waters to reach
Gorbachev, resting on a luxurious Soviet cruise liner tied up at
shore.
   A White House statement, making fun of the frustration, said,
``The 60 miles per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship
this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon
sail.''
   Stranded on the Belknap along with Bush were Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, Brent Scowcroft, the president's national
security adviser, and Marlin Fitzwater, the president's press
secretary.
   The meeting on ships in the Mediterranean had been Bush's idea
for the beginning, but the White House tried to share any
embarrassment with the Soviets.
   ``We are disappointed that the Soviet delegation was unable to
join us for dinner on Belknap due to the storm,'' the statement
said, adding that U.S. officials look forward to Sunday's scheduled
meeting.
   ``We also regret that we were unable to visit the Slava for this
afternoon's meeting,'' it added. The Slava, a Soviet naval cruiser,
was to have been the site for Saturday's meeting, but the talks
were moved to a Soviet cruise liner docked at the shore.
   Stating the obvious, the statement said that Bush and his
delegation would remain on the Belknap for the night. ``We expect
Sunday's schedule to be maintained as orginally planned,'' it said.

<HEAD>After Six Months, Foley Has Imposed Leadership Style on House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Through the upheaval of Democratic leadership,
the fight with the White House over capital gains and the
end-of-session pay raise, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley has been
able to maintain his dry sense of humor.
   During his last daily news conference before Congress adjourned
last month, the Washington Democrat took note of the first live
telecast of the proceedings of the British House of Commons.
   ``I know you're going to think they are much more witty and much
more stimulating in every way,'' Foley, an ardent admirer of
Britain's parliamentary system, said of his British counterparts.
   ``What I understand from reading the paper is that British
television consultants have been suggesting that they behave like
U.S. congressmen, which will make it a dull place, indeed, over
there if they do.''
   Foley went on to say that the speaker of the British House of
Commons recently asked him what number speaker he was.
   ``I said I was the 49th,'' Foley said. ``He said he was the
634th. They generally date the speakership from 1377.
   ``And I said, `Well, that's what we call a putdown in the United
States, Mr. Speaker.'
   ``And he said, ``Well, eight of them were beheaded, two of them
on the same day.'''
   After six months as speaker, Foley also has been able to impose
his leadership style on a House that was soured by deep, partisan
divisions that climaxed in the resignation of former Speaker Jim
Wright of Texas.
   Foley has preached the doctrine of cooperation, not
confrontation, and reduced the bitterness and tension by working
closely with Republican leaders to create an atmosphere in which
policy differences, rather than personal or partisan differences,
dominate the debate.
   As the first session of the 101st Congress ground to a close,
House Minority Leader Bob Michel of Illinois introduced a
resolution thanking Foley for the ``able, impartial and dignified
manner'' in which he had run the House.
   ``Part of the achievement has been getting the focus of Congress
back on the legislative agenda,'' Foley said in an interview. ``I
don't accept the notion that Democrats should be confrontational
and resist everything the administration does.''
   Despite lingering grumblings from some Democrats that Foley
needs to be more combative, the speaker said he has no intention of
changing his approach.
   ``I am not a basher,'' Foley said. ``Just to be an opponent of
the president every day of the week because I'm a Democrat and he's
a Republican is not what I think the public had in mind. ... That
doesn't mean we will be a Greek chorus of background for the
administration.''
   Foley gave the first session of Congress a grade of B, pointing
with pride to legislation bailing out the savings and loan
industry, raising the minimum wage, increasing funding for the war
on drugs and overhauling existing oil spill liability laws.
   Foley also defended the pay increase, which was coupled with
what he called the ``most important'' ethics reforms since 1977.
   ``I don't fool myself that this is always the most popular
legislation with the public,'' Foley said of the pay raise.
   Foley said he was disappointed there was no final action on
child care legislation and that both Congress and the
administration ``wasted time and energy'' on an ``ill-timed,
ill-conceived'' proposal to cut capital gains taxes.
   He said that how the United States reacts to the easing of
tensions with the Eastern bloc and ``carve up the peace dividend''
if the defense budget is cut will be top priority issues for
Congress next year.
   But he said it was ``premature'' to talk about deep cuts in the
defense budget.
   The speaker said he too was caught off guard by the rapid pace
of the developments in Eastern Europe and it is hard to
``contemplate where it will lead. It is premature to say the Cold
War is over.''
   Foley did not rule out the possibility of the United States
committing ``money and resources'' to furthering the opening of
Eastern Europe and suggested that Congress may have to approve
``credits for food and fuel'' to prop up the Soviet economy through
the winter.

   President Bush and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, meeting at a storm-curtailed summit,
discussed the political upheaval in in Eastern Europe on Saturday
and vowed to respond to events with ``with sensitivity and firm
initiative,'' U.S. officials said.
   After five hours of talks that began with handshakes and smiles
between the two leaders, a White House statement said the meetings
``were marked by a spirit of forward-looking cooperation during
these increasingly changing times.''
   But gale-force winds and roiling seas forced cancellation of
afternoon talks and a scheduled dinner. Bush was unable to leave
the USS Belknap and cross 500 yards of Meditereanean Sea to reach
Gorbachev, resting on a luxurious Soviet cruise liner tied up at
shore.
   Both sides said the reason for the change in schedule was the
weather.
   Referring to the talks held before weather intervened, Gennady
Gerasimov, Gorbachev's spokesman, said ``things went well. They
talked about everything, arms, Europe, philosphical questions.''
   Bush opened the morning meeting with an hour-long presentation,
proposing more than a dozen ideas for economic and political
progress in U.S.-Soviet relations, the White House statement said,
without elaboration.
   It said the talks ranged from the economic situation in Eastern
Europe to arms control and Central America, and added that
Gorbachev spoke at length about perestroika, his program of
economic restructuring, and the goals of his reform program.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler stressed there
was ``no other reason'' for the change in schedule except the
weather.
   A White House statement said, ``The 60 miles per hour winds
preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have
made for a very exciting afternoon sail.''
   Bush and Gorbachev had been scheduled to wrap up their talks on
Sunday, and the White House said ``we expect'' that to be the case.
   The weather aside, the White House assessment of the talks was
upbeat. ``We feel this has been a very productive day in terms of
the five hour meeting this morning,'' said the White House.
   ``I think we've got a very good beginning of the dialogue ... an
excellent beginning,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker III told
reporters after Bush and Gorbachev completed their initial session.
   ``They recognized that economic and political challenges were
ahead for Eastern Europe, and voewed to consider the opportunities
presented with sensitivity and firm initiative,'' said the
statement issued later.
   ``The first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which
you cannot board in this kind of weather,'' Gorbachev joked to Bush
as he welcomed him aboard.
   ``We will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the (U.S.)
Sixth Fleet,'' the Soviet leader said with a laugh. The Soviets are
serious, however, in pressing the United States to agree to
reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and
to remove nuclear weapons from the Mediterranean zone.
   As the small talk ended, Bush said, ``Let's go to work.''
   Bush braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the
Soviet liner, and then ran into trouble when he returned to his
command ship, the cruiser USS Belknap, also anchored about 500
yards from land.
   His launch had to make four passes at the Belknap before he
could board.
   The White House sought to minimize the effect the bad weather
was having on the summit and put an upbeat spin on the talks,
saying that Bush thought the talks were ``extremely productive.''
   Senior Soviet officials said Gorbachev wants the summit to
produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties on reducing
strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in central Europe
and chemical weapons.
   These officials, who spoke only on condition they not be
identified, said Gorbachev will convene a meeting of Warsaw Pact
leaders in Moscow on Monday to discuss the results of the two-day
summit. Bush will spend Monday briefing allied leaders at NATO
headquarters in Brussels, Belgium.
   Gorbachev and Bush were smiling and in high spirits as they
clasped hands across a long rectangular table, measuring barely a
yard across.
   ``It's so narrow that if we don't have enough arguments, we'll
kick each other,'' Gorbachev told Bush.
   Asked by reporters if they would reach make any achievements,
Gorbachev replied, `` da, da (yes, yes).'' On what? he was asked.
``Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning ``a lot of things.''
   When Bush was asked the same question, the president echoed
Gorbachev. ``Mnogovo,'' he said.
   The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like
room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and
nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck.
   They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on
either side.
   Bush, who had spent the night on the storm-buffeted Belknap,
said he had not been bothered by the rough weather. ``Piece of
cake,'' he said.
   Bush and Gorbachev held three rounds of talks that the White
House said amounted to almost continuous discussions between 10:05
a.m. until 3 p.m.
   They began with an expanded meeting that included at least 16
people and then held a one-on-one session, with notetakers, that
lasted about 1{ hours. That was followed by a working lunch, after
which Bush returned to the Belknap for some private time.
   The rain and wind disrupted Raisa Gorbachev's sightseeing plans.
She at first canceled plans to visit a 16th Century cathedral,
choosing to remain aboard the Gorky, but then later went ahead with
the tour. First lady Barbara Bush did not accompany Bush to the
Mediterranean.

   American consumers are likely to see
broad changes in the way they do business with their bankers and
investment firms in the early 1990s.
   That was the prospect raised Friday when Wall Street's main
trade group, the Securities Industry Association, proposed a
radical revamping of the 56-year-old law that defines what distinct
services banks and brokers can offer.
   That law, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is designed to guard
against conflicts of interest and threats to financial stability
by, for example, keeping a safe distance between bank deposits and
risky investments like stocks.
   But in recent years financial deregulation in this country and
increasing international competition have been steadily chipping
away at Glass-Steagall.
   Banks have entered the securities business, such as by opening
discount brokerage offices and selling mutual funds. Brokers have
encroached on bankers' turf by creating ``central assets accounts''
that are not federally insured, but feature check-writing and
credit cards.
   Late Friday the SIA endorsed a proposal to scrap Glass-Steagall
and rebuild it from the ground up. This approach could result in
new services being available at banks or investment firms, and it
conceivably could wipe out some changes consumers have grown used
to in recent years.
   ``The critical question is not whether there will be a
Glass-Steagall in the future, but what will replace it,'' Richard
Breeden, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said Saturday.
   Proponents of the change stress that they want to keep federally
insured deposits separate from investments and securities deals
that are exposed to market risks.
   But they do envision single corporate entities, formed perhaps
through mergers, with separate subsidiaries overseen by separate
regulators that would offer banking and brokerage services.
   Advocates of the change say American financial companies of all
kinds need a new framework to compete with foreign financial
institutions of increasing size and strength, with a growing
presence in this country.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said of the SIA initiative,
``I think that's appropriate, particularly from an international
perspective.''
   Many interested parties are still to be heard from on the
proposal, including the Federal Reserve and the banking industry.
And for the proposal to become reality, Congress would have to take
a new look at the issue when it reconvenes next year.
   ``We recognize how complex these matters are and that they will
take time to work out,'' said Robert Downey, a partner at the
prominent Wall Street firm of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co., who took over
Friday as the SIA's chairman for the next year.
   ``Our nation's banks and securities firms need to be ready to
compete internationally. But we must avoid precipitating huge new
risks for the federal deposit insurance system.
   ``We do not want a repeat of the $160 billion bailout of the
thrift industry.''

   A 19-year-old man shot himself to death
in a game of Russian roulette as a group of people watched, police
said.
   Kevin Pillow of Rochester shot himself in the head with a
.38-caliber revolver Friday morning, said police Officer Michael
Coon.
   Five or six of Pillow's acquaintances watched the shooting, Coon
said.
   Witnesses told police that Pillow placed one bullet in the
chamber, spun and closed it, then put it to his head and fired. The
gun did not discharge, so Pillow pulled the trigger again and was
killed, Coon said.
   Pillow was pronounced dead at the scene.

   Other leaders have predicted better
times are coming, but President Carlos Andre Perez has bet his
homeland on it.
   Perez says he will seek asylum in some other country if next
year's inflation goes over 40 percent, half this year's projected
rate.
   In statements published in Saturday newspapers, he said the
government's economic reform plan and measures to keep down
inflation were working well.
   ``We won't go over 80 percent ... and next year, if we come out
with even half of this year's, I'll go into exile,'' he said.
   A similar prediction in February nearly had Perez packing his
bags.
   Shortly after his inauguration that month, Perez startled
Venezuelans by promising to go into exile if 1989's inflation went
over 80 percent. This year's inflation, including November's 1.3
percent, comes to 77.9 percent.

<HEAD>Solar Max Meets a Fiery End Over Indian Ocean; No Sightings Reported</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Solar Maximum satellite, a scientific
window to the Earth, the sun and even distant stars for nearly 10
years, plunged to its fiery destruction Saturday in the atmosphere
over the Indian Ocean.
   Capt. Thomas Niemann of the U.S. Space Command in Colorado
Springs, Colo., said the satellite re-entered the Earth's
protective atmosphere at about 5:26 a.m. EST, and broke up in what
likely was a 500-mile-long path of burning debris over the Indian
Ocean, roughly halfway between the coasts of India and Australia.
   Niemann said there were no reported sightings of the plunge of
Solar Max, which occurred during afternoon hours in that part of
the world. A re-entry at night could have produced a spectacular
fireworks display visible for hundreds of miles.
   There was speculation that a chunk of the satellite, involving
an inch-thick titanium plate about 5 feet high by 4 feet wide,
might survive the searing journey through the atmosphere. But ``If
it did, it's at the bottom of the Indian Ocean,'' Niemann said. ``I
think we've heard the last of Solar Max.''
   The Solar Max, once given new life by the ill-fated space
shuttle Challenger, succumbed to its decaying orbit after a
research odyssey in which it traveled 1.4 billion miles, in an
orbit which normally ranged 300 miles from Earth.
   Launched in February 1980, Solar Max was the first satellite
designed to be retrieved by a space shuttle crew. That came in
handy in 1984, when the shuttle Challenger drew alongside, brought
the satellite into the cargo bay, replaced a failed electronics box
and sent Solar Max back on its way.
   That was the first satellite repair mission in space. A month
later, Solar Max recorded one of the largest flare eruptions ever
seen on the sun.
   Other achievements in Solar Max's career:
   _In 1987, its gamma ray spectrometer was the first instrument to
detect rays from Supernova 1987a, a distant star that exploded in a
neighboring galaxy, the Magellanic Cloud.
   _It detected 10 comets colliding with the sun, the latest on
Sept. 28.
   _Its ultraviolet spectrometer detected increases in
high-altitude ozone levels around the Earth just north of the
equator, and decreases just south of the equator.
   _It recorded more than 12,500 solar flares _ powerful eruptions
on the sun, and made it possible for scientists to measure sunspot
magnetic fields above the visible surface of the sun for the first
time.
   The satellite orbited at an altitude of 300 miles originally and
maintained its position with spinning wheels and magnetic torque
bars. But as Solar Max traveled 1.4 billion miles, its altitude
gradually lowered, until it was subjected to intense heat from
friction with thicker air.
   There was no way to boost it to a higher orbit without help from
another shuttle, and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration said it could not fit such a $25 million rescue
mission into the shuttle schedule.
   David Douds, deputy project manager for satellite servicing
missions at the NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said the public
got its money's worth from the $77 million satellite.
   ``It provided a real window into the dynamics of solar activity
and total output of the sun,'' Douds said.
   Originally, the Space Command had predicted the satellite would
smash into the atmosphere at 6:12 a.m. EST over the Pacific Ocean,
and west of the Galapagos Islands. But it had cautioned that the
projection could be far off the mark, because of variables such as
the satellite's attitude at re-entry and waves in the upper
atmosphere.
   All along, experts had said the chances of fragments hitting a
populated area were remote. More than 80 percent of Solar Max's
orbital path was over water. In the United States, only Hawaii and
extreme south Texas and south Florida were on its track.

<HEAD>High School Chemistry Teacher Is Lithuania's Poet Laureate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Vitalija Keblys left her home in
1945 just ahead of invading Russian troops, she never dreamed she
would be invited back to her native land to be honored as the poet
laureate of Lithuania.
   But that's what happened when the high school chemistry teacher
became the 20th person, the fourth woman and the only ``foreigner''
to hold the honor in Lithuania, once an independent country but
under Soviet domination since World War II.
   ``I was born in Lithuania, but we left when the Russians were
coming, and now I am an American citizen, so I am really a
foreigner in my native land,'' she said.
   ``We left on foot,'' she continued. ``We just walked away. The
Russians were only half a mile away, and as we left we could see
them. We went to Dresden and lived through the Dresden firebombing.
   ``I came to the states with $2 in my pocket. I was 15 years old,
and a friend of mine had sent me the money.''
   The young immigrant arrived in Baltimore as a sophomore in high
school but went to work in a factory and finished high school in
summers and evenings in just over a year. She studied chemistry
because she knew mathematics but not English.
   ``I was in a Shakespeare course, and I could memorize it but
didn't know what it meant,'' she said in a recent interview. ``I
wasn't going to stay in the factory, so I worked and went to school
at Notre Dame of Maryland and got my master's in chemistry
education.''
   Keblys, 55, kept writing all her life _ in Lithuanian.
   ``I was a poet before I was a chemist,'' she said. ``I never
write in English because I don't have the command of the language.
It has to be your mother tongue. I'm strictly a Lithuanian poet. I
teach in English and write in Lithuanian.''
   Keblys met her husband, Kestutis Keblys, at a Lithuanian college
student meeting in New York. The two discovered they had lived in
villages some 20 miles apart and had left at about the same time to
spend much of their childhood in refugee camps, then came to the
United States and on to college.
   All of Keblys' work has been published in Chicago, except her
last book of poetry, ``Kelione'' (``A Journey''), which was
published in Lithuania. She writes under her maiden name, Vitalija
Bogutaite.
   Her husband describes her poetry as ``not nationalistic in a
direct way. But in a symbolic way she brings out concerns about
national survival and the oppression of the war years.''
   A few of her poems have been translated, and ``Ode Laikue'' (Ode
to Time) reveals some of her attachment to her native country:
   ``When you will tear and divide
   the steaming loaf of rye
   remember that it too swayed and ripened
   in the fields of my homeland.''
   Keblys went to Lithuania two years ago and again this year to
participate in the festival, an event that draws crowds comparable
to football-game crowds in the United States.
   This summer she went with her husband to the festival and didn't
know she had won the prize until she arrived. Its 500-ruble prize _
worth about $350 at the time _ was about what a Lithuanian doctor
would earn in three months, she said.
   ``I didn't expect to get the prize,'' she said Saturday. ``I
just went to sit in and celebrate with them at the poetry festival.
When I got off the plane in Moscow, I was told I won the prize. As
long as it wasn't the Lenin prize, it was fine by me.''
   In Baton Rouge, she teaches honors and advanced placement
chemistry at Scotlandville Magnet High School. Her husband, a
chemist for the Ethyl Corp., also teaches in the schools as a
volunteer once a week.
   She is now working on a new poem, ``Meditation,'' which is eight
pages long and is ``conversations with myself.''

   A $4 million sexual harassment and
discrimination lawsuit filed against political talk show host John
J. McLaughlin by a former employee reportedly has been settled out
of court.
   Attorneys for McLaughlin and the woman who brought the suit,
Linda D. Dean, confirmed the settlement but refused to disclose the
terms, The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions.
   Aides to McLaughlin and his attorney, Fred F. Fielding, said
Saturday afternoon they were not immediately available to confirm
the report.
   McLaughlin, 60, is host of ``The McLaughlin Group,'' a political
panel show that airs weekly on 230 public television stations and
four NBC-affiliated stations.
   The U.S. District Court lawsuit, filed in August 1988, described
a ``work environment which was hostile to women'' and charged
McLaughlin with ``sexually degrading and offensive remarks and
behavior ... toward past and present female employees.''
   Fielding issued a statement at the time the suit was filed
saying that McLaughlin and his production company ``emphatically
deny these bizarre and outrageous allegations.''
   McLaughlin, a former Jesuit priest and onetime speech writer for
Richard M. Nixon, has been married since 1975 to Ann Dore
McLaughlin, who was a secretary of Labor in the Reagan
administration.

<TEXT>
   The army began disarming the
Communist Party's paramilitary force on Saturday, putting thousands
of rifles into warehouses at the demand of opposition leaders.
   And Czechoslovakia's leading dissident warned the new coalition
government being formed this weekend to implement democratic
reforms without delay or face renewed opposition from millions who
have taken to the streets.
   The People's Militia, the force created 40 years ago to protect
the workplace from counterrevolution and later guarded the
Communists' monopoly on power, began surrendering weapons to the
army, the state-run news agency CTK reported. All weapons were
expected to be in army hands by Sunday.
   ``This is to honor a pledge by the new Communist leadership that
in the solution of the current political situation (the
paramilitary) means of the party will not be used,'' an unnamed
Politburo member was quoted as saying.
   The action came one day after Politburo member Vasil Mohorita
agreed to turn over control of the Communists' militia to the state
as a concession to opposition demands that the militia be disbanded.
   There was no mention of the future of the militia.
   The gray-uniformed militia is a paid, part-time force that is
believed to have tens of thousands of members recruited from among
workers. It was last used in January to help riot police smash a
weeklong series of demonstrations in Prague.
   In its terse dispatch, CTK noted that the Politburo spokesman
made the announcement after concerns were expressed by segments of
the population over ``increased movement of military vehicles on
Czechoslovak territory.''
   That was an obvious attempt to dispel any fears of army
intervention to reverse the democratic reforms that have been
promised.
   The beleaguered Communist-controlled government last week agreed
to appoint a new government by Sunday that will include
non-Communists for the first time since Warsaw Pact tanks crushed
``Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968.
   Playwright Vaclav Havel, a leader of the Civic Forum opposition
group, said the rapid pace of change must continue.
   ``If we are to structure our society in a democratic, peaceful,
decent and loving way, and avoid possible conflicts, then it is
necessary for the government to act quickly, and not only declare
certain things, but really implement them,'' he told the Communist
Party daily Rude Pravo.
   ``Any kind of postponement or delay would turn not only against
us, that is in this case the Civic Forum, but also against the
government and the entire society,'' Havel said.
   ``It would mean that all of us failed to manage the situation,''
he added.
   Havel spoke after six tough hours of negotiations Friday with
Czech Prime Minister Frantisek Pitra on the shape of the new
government.
   Federal Premier Ladislav Adamec agreed Tuesday in talks with
Havel and other Civic Forum representatives to include
non-Communists in the government. An announcement was expected
Sunday, government spokesman Marcel Jansen said.
   Because Czechoslovakia is a federation of the Czech and Slovak
republics, formation of the new federal government will have to be
accompanied by overhauls in the Czech and Slovak governments.
Justice and education, for instance, two key areas in which the
opposition seeks reforms, are controlled by the republic
governments.
   Civic Forum spokesman Jiri Dienstbier told The Associated Press
the opposition is not proposing specific candidates for the new
Cabinet but concentrating on outlining what characteristics the
office holders should have.
   Communists, members of previously docile allied parties, and
non-party people are acceptable to Civic Forum if they have no
obvious blemishes in their pasts and are willing to implement
reforms now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy,
Dienstbier said.
   Civic Forum, established only 13 days ago, is an umbrella
movement of opposition groups. Its leaders have said they are not
offering themselves for Cabinet posts but have left open the
possibility of accepting nominations.
   ``I am a writer by profession, and I'd like to stay one,'' Havel
said, when asked by Rude Pravo if he aimed for office. ``I never
had ambitions of being a politician. I don't feel qualified for
it.''
   ``I'd like to get back into the theater,'' he said. Havel's
plays were banned for 20 years here until censorship was largely
removed last week.
   ``I firmly believe and hope that it will not be necessary (for
me to become a politician) and that the common good, which I always
place above my own interests, is not going to force me into
anything of the kind,'' Havel said.
   The formation of the new government will cap a week of historic
changes, brought on by 11 days of anti-government demonstrations
and a nationwide general strike Monday that sent millions into the
streets.
   On Tuesday, Adamec agreed to include non-Communists in the
government.
   On Wednesday, Parliament formally removed the Communists'
guaranteed leading role in politics from the constitution. A
Politburo member said free elections would be held within a year.
   On Friday, the Communists dramatically reversed 21 years of
policy, condemning the 1968 invasion that crushed the ``Prague
Spring'' reforms, and paving the way for a formal reassessment by
the Warsaw Pact in Moscow later this month.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev swiftly followed the
admission by saying the 1968 reforms were correct and democratic
and that the Soviet-led invasion was an ``inappropriate response''
from Moscow.

<TEXT>
   George Bush, commander-in-chief of
the world's largest Navy, was marooned on his own ship Saturday as
a fierce December gale bewildered the best-laid plans of superpower
leaders, protesters and local tourism officials.
   ``This is the type of weather that shipwrecked Saint Paul on
these rocks. We usually have this in February,'' said Joe Cassar, a
government official on Malta, host country to the snake-bit
superpower summit.
   Winds gusting to 60 miles per hour and thundering foam-topped
waves forced a postponement of a second round of talks between Bush
and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev until Sunday, as well as
cancellation of a scheduled dinner.
   The weather also played havoc at the fringes of the summit. A
big anti-nuclear parade was postponed until Sunday and Raisa
Gorbachev's schedule of sightseeing on the island was disrupted.
   This wasn't what local tourism officials had in mind, either. A
government travel brochure describes Malta as the ``perfect winter
holiday destination.''
   ``The sun worshipper who flees Northern Europe's cold and damp
winter weather finds in Malta the perfect refuge,'' the brochure
says, adding that the island 's mild winter climate ``makes it
possible to practice quite a variety of winter sports.''
   Be that as it may, seas that built overnight forced a change of
sites for the opening session between Bush and Gorbachev.
   Instead of holding the morning meeting aboard the Soviet cruiser
Slava, the leaders met aboard a Soviet luxury liner docked at a
pier in a more sheltered part of the bay. The liner, the Maxim
Gorky, normally caters to West German tourists on North Sea cruises.
   Bush crossed the choppy bay from his summit headquarters aboard
the USS Belknap to the Gorky without incident on a canopy-covered
admiral's barge. But returning after lunch was more of a problem as
the heaving launch had to make three passes before it could safely
deliver Bush to the U.S. ship.
   Then, the weather got worse. Bush, a former naval aviator and
speedboat enthusiast, wound up stuck on the cruiser for the night.
   ``The 60 mile per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship
this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon
sail,'' said a statement by White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater was stranded with Bush, as were Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft.
   ``They cannot get off of the Belknap,'' said Baker's aide,
Margaret Tutwiler.
   Sig Rogich, director of advance planning for the White House,
was asked if he was disappointed that the elaborately staged scene
of the ships and meetings had been disrupted by the weather. Rogich
frowned slightly and nodded.
   The original script called for Bush to travel by boat from the
8,600-ton Belknap to the 12,500-ton Slava to begin his talks with
Gorbachev.
   Conditions were not bad enough as to endanger anyone on board
the heavy warships, but the waves were rough enough to make getting
on and off from smaller shuttle craft a major problem.
   Summit planners apparently considered moving Saturday's meeting
to land, but finally decided to use the 25,000-ton Gorky,
Gorbachev's floating residence during the weekend. It is moored at
a pier about 1,000 yards from the Belknap.
   Moving the talks to the Gorky in case of bad weather was one of
several contingencies that had been discussed prior to the weekend,
said the assistant to the Maltese prime minister who has been in
charge of planning the Maltese side of the meeting.
   ``It is December in the Mediterranean,'' said Richard Cacchia
Caruana, noting the weather is always undependable this time of
year. ``We made sure that both the Soviets and the Americans knew
about it.''
   ``We've done the best we could in three weeks,'' said Cacchia
Caruana philosophically. ``We really couldn't do anything about the
weather.''
   Fear of bad weather was one reason it was decided to hold the
summit in Marsaxlokk Bay rather than further off the coast of
Malta, he said.
   Cold air from western Russia appeared to be the culprit for the
low pressure system causing the strong easterly winds over the
central Mediterranean, said Maltese meteorologist Spiro Agius.
   ``It will definitely be improving tomorrow,'' Agius added.
   But maybe not.
   Forecaster David Membrey of the London Weather Center said to
expect the strong winds to continue through Sunday afternoon.

   Nine-year-old Amanda Walker put her Christmas wish
list on 3-by-5 index cards, thinking that since she's deaf that
would be the best way to communicate with Santa Claus.
   Santa had a surprise for her Friday at Valley View Mall. He knew
sign language.
   ``She got a lot more animated when she saw that I could sign.
That opened things up more,'' said Curtis Snethen of suburban
Irving, who has been filling in for Santa at several malls this
year.
   Snethen, who learned sign language in a class at his church,
said his role reminds him of the scene in the holiday movie
classic, ``Miracle on 34th Street.''
   ``It's the part where the girl who has just arrived from Holland
is sent in to talk to Santa, and Santa is told the girl only speaks
Dutch and to just nod along like he understands her,'' Snethen
said. ``And then when Santa answers her in Dutch and her eyes
sparkle ...
   ``That's beyond her imagination, but that's Santa, and Santa is
part of the miracle of Christmas.''
   Amanda asked Santa for roller skates and dolls.

   A businesswoman is leading a drive to
give more than a thousand sleeping bags to the city's street people.
   ``Were replacing HO, HO, HO with OH, OH, OH, for Operation
Homeless,'' said Jane Ashford, an investment adviser for Ashford
Capital Management Co. The sleeping bags will be distributed the
week before Christmas, Ashford said.
   ``We're not deluded into thinking were curing the problem,''
said Ashford. ``We just want to keep the homeless warm.''
   Ashford said state social services officials estimate there are
1,200 homeless people in Wilmington. Although she suspects the
number is higher, Ashford said 1,200 ``seems to be a number we can
deal with reasonably'' in supplying sleeping bags.
   The bags could be used not only by those sleeping on the street,
but also by women and children living in vacant, abandoned or
condemned buildings, she said.
   Ashford said the drive is being coordinated by two social
service agencies, Immanuel Dining Room West and Friendship House.

   A formation of
French-built Mirage 2000 jet fighters highlighted a two-hour
military parade here Saturday marking the 18th anniversary of the
1971 merger of seven sheikdoms into the United Arab Emirates.
   Desert drummers and torch bearers marched through streets along
with sword-wielding nationals in Bedouin robes and headgear as each
of the emirates also held separate celebrations.
   U.A.E. President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan attended the
display of ground, sea and air weapons at a seafront boulevard in
Abu Dhabi. About 5,000 spectators packed a grandstand.
   Flanked by his top aides and rulers of the various emirates, the
leader clapped as the Mirages swooped low overhead. One Mirage drew
an ovation with aerobatics before formations of transport planes,
armed helicopters and interceptors paraded.
   The Mirage 2000s, six in all, were delivered a few days ago, the
first batch of a $2.2 billion deal signed with France in 1985 and
involving a total of 36 Mirages and various types of military
hardware.
   The arrival of the Mirages was seen as a sign of improved
relations with France after a disagreement over a demand that the
aircraft be equipped with U.S.-built Sidewinder air-to-surface
missiles.
   The parade was attended by French Defense Minister Jean-Pierre
Chevenement along with a number of Arab Cabinet ministers and
military commanders.
   Units of the various arms of the 43,000-strong armed forces took
part in the parade, which also featured French-made Gazelle and
Alouette III helicopters, Crotale, Exocet and Rapier missiles,
Ferret scout cars, Saladin and Saracen armored personnel carriers.
   U.S.-made Hercules and Buffalo transport planes and
British-built Hawk jet fighters also were displayed.
   It was the first military parade since 1977. Armed Forces Chief
of Staff Gen. Mohammed Saeed al-Badi said the parades had been
interrupted largely on account of ``sadness caused by the Middle
East wars'' and the recent eight-year conflict between Iran and
Iraq.
   A leading oil-exporting nation, the U.A.E. like its neighboring
countries of the Persian Gulf has diverted sizable funds from the
oil bonanza years of the 1970s to build a strong military.
   Traditionally armed by Britain, which controlled the former
Trucial Coast sheikdoms from which the U.A.E. was formed in 1971,
the federation has spread out its military shopping.
   Aside from France, it has concluded new arms deals with Britain,
Italy and Egypt offering unspecified types of weapons.
   Al-Badi said the U.A.E. was in the process of strengthening the
armed forces and will shortly introduce conscription.
   The federation comprises Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ras
al-Khaimah, Umm al-Quwain, Fujairah and Ajman, under the leadership
of the bigger and richer Abu Dhabi.
   The vast revenues from oil sales have helped turn large tracts
into farmland, build light industries and give its estimated 1.8
million people one of the world's highest per capita incomes _
$15,000.
   Mainly due to oil and gas sales, the country's gross national
product increased from $1.81 billion in 1972 to $24.52 billion in
1989, according to Central Bank statements.
   The federation, mainly Abu Dhabi and Dubai, produces a total of
2.6 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to a recent
statement by Oil Minister Mana Saeed Otaiba. It earned some $3.5
billion this year from oil exports, but suffers a budget deficit of
$500 million. The deficits have been chronic since the world oil
market weakened in the early 1980s.
   Sheik Zayed in a speech appealed to Iran and Iraq to hasten the
pace toward a peace treaty ``so that the gulf may reap the fruit of
stability and security.''
   He also declared his ``undivided support'' for the Palestinian
uprising against Israel in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, asking
leaders of the world to help the Palestinians regain their ``rights
and stop the barbaric perpetrations of Israel against the Arabs in
occupied territory.''
   He urged the people and leaders of Lebanon to patch up their
differences and push their country toward national reconciliation.

without the cycle, authorities said.
   David Guillen, 33, died late Friday at St. Francis Medical

   Sheriff's Deputy Rafael Estrada said Guillen was on his way to
use a pay phone when he saw four men in a car confront a
13-year-old boy who was pushing a disabled mo-ped.
   One man pulled a gun and demanded the mo-ped, Estrada said. When
Guillen told the group to leave the teen-ager alone, the gunman
turned and shot him, and the four fled in their car without the

   Bell is about eight miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles.

   Black nationalist Nelson
Mandela eventually will be freed from prison, President F.W. de
Klerk said Saturday, but he refused to say when.
   Meanwhile, police used dogs, whips and batons to break up
protest rallies in Durban and Cape Town, witnesses said, while a
march to a police station in the rural Orange Free State was
allowed.
   De Klerk returned from a visit to the Ivory Coast, which has
demanded that Mandela be released before it agrees to establish
diplomatic relations with South Africa.
   ``As and when it is possible, he will be released. But I am not
prepared to speculate on when,'' de Klerk told a news conference in
Yamoussoukro after a day of talks with President Felix
Houphouet-Boigny in the Ivory Coast.
   Mandela, 71, was convicted of sabotage and subversion in 1964
and is serving a life term. Last year, the African National
Congress leader was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis and
later transferred to a home on a prison farm.
   De Klerk said he was hopeful that South Africa could establish
relations with the Ivory Coast, whose president has praised his
reforms.
   ``I don't think it is a dream. It can become a reality,'' he
said.
   Houphouet-Boigny has made clear that though he favors closer
economic ties with South Africa and favors negotiations to end
apartheid, Mandela must be released before full relations can be
established.
   Police used whips and dogs to break up an attempted march by
thousands of blacks against inadequate housing and rent increases
in Durban, said a journalist, who said children were trampled as
the crowd fled in all directions. Shoppers, and people posting
Christmas mail were dragged away to police vehicles.
   Police said they used rubber batons to disperse thousands of
people who marched in the streets in defiance of a police order.

<HEAD>Bomb Tossed at Cabinet Minister's Home; No Injuries</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MOHAMMED SALAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bomb was tossed from a speeding car
Saturday at the south Lebanon home of Information Minister Edmond
Rizk, a foe of Christian Gen. Michel Aoun, causing damage but no
injuries, police said.
   Also Saturday, Aoun's command accused Syrian forces of firing at
a Lebanese army helicopter hovering over thousands of Aoun
supporters forming a human wall around his headquarters in the
presidential palace.
   A communique said eight supporters were wounded by falling
shrapnel from a Syrian anti-aircraft barrage, which missed the
helicopter.
   ``Gen. Aoun bestowed military medals on the eight injured
youths,'' the communique said. It did not specify the seriousness
of their injuries.
   The Syrian army command in Lebanon did not comment.
   The incident occurred a few hours before the arrival of eight
French lawmakers to declare support for Aoun, who opposes Lebanon's
Syrian-backed president and has vowed to drive Syrian troops out of
Lebanon.
   Rizk, a Maronite like Aoun, was in Moslem west Beirut when his
house was bombed at 10:30 a.m. in his hometown of Jizzine, 25 miles
south of the capital.
   His wife and children, who were at the house, escaped injury,
according to police.
   Rizk was among the Lebanese legislators who approved an
Arab-brokered peace plan for Lebanon in a special Parliament
session in Taif, Saudi Arabia in October. Aoun opposed the accord
because it does not set a timetable for the withdrawal of the
40,000 Syrian troops in Lebanon.
   The accord cleared the way for election of a president.
   Rizk was named information minister in Lebanon's newly formed
national reconciliation government, which was entrusted with
applying the Taif accord to end 14 years of civil war.
   Rizk's house was the first to be attacked in areas controlled by
the South Lebanon Army, a predmoninantly Christian militia allied
with Israel.
   There were similar bomb attacks on the homes of eight other
legislators in the Christian enclave controlled by Aoun's army in
the past five weeks.
   Rizk blamed the attack on ``Gen. Aoun and agents he recruited to
undermine the whole of Lebanon.''
   The right-wing French parliamentarians did not make any
statements when they arrived at the shell-wrecked presidential
palace in Baabda, five miles east of Beirut.
   They held a brief meeting with Aoun, who refuses to give up the
palace to President Elias Hrawi. Hrawi was elected by Parliament
last month after Rene Mouawad was assassinated by a bomb after 17
days in office.
   The French legislators then joined a dance with some of the
thousands of Christian youths camped in the woods around the palace
since Tuesday to raise the ante if Syria decides to attack Aoun.
   Last week, 33 right-wing French Parliament members visited the
Christian enclave for 24 hours to declare support for Aoun.
   The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio said the final decision on
how to evict Aoun from the palace will be taken this week.
   It said Hrawi agreed to delay the move in an effort to prevent
bloodshed.
   ``But if Aoun refuses to end his mutiny peacefully, then the
proper decision will be taken,'' the radio said.
   An-Nahar, an independent daily, quoted Hrawi as saying an
assault to dislodge Aoun has been delayed at the request of a
``number of Arab and foreign states'' that he did not identify.
   But at a news conference Thursday, Hrawi said, ``The day of
judgment is very near.'' Hrawi, a Maronite Christian like Aoun,
stressed that he hoped Aoun would leave the palace peacefully.
   Hrawi's remark coincided with a buildup of Syrian tanks,
artillery, and commando forces around the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave north of Beirut, an apparent preparation for an assault to
dislodge Aoun.
   Syrian troops were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 under an Arab
League peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war fighting. Aoun
said they abrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems.

   From the victims of Pan Am Flight 103 to
``Women for a meaningful summit,'' led by the divorced wife of
former Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, interest groups with their
own agenda were also stymied Saturday by the storm from placing
their issues before the summiteers.
   A delegation of the families of victims of the Lockerbie air
disaster arrived in Malta Saturday with a letter urging George Bush
and Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose an economic squeeze on such
countries as Syria and Iran for their alleged backing of terrorism.
   On Sunday, they planned to drop 270 flowers in the storm-tossed
Mediterranean in remembrance of those killed when a terrorist bomb
ripped apart the Pan Am airliner over the Scottish town last
December 21.
   Many of the groups had planned to deliver statements to Bush or
Gorbachev aides, most of whom were tied up in the storm-tossed
meetings or not reachable at their hotels or the Maxim Gorky liner
docked at Marsaxlokk Bay.
   Dr. Jim Swire said he had confirmation, however ,that the
delegation's four-page message had been received at the White House.
   At another venue, Margaret Papandreou and her women's peace
network claiming to represent `` millions of women around the world
(who) have sent representatives to all summit meetings'', urged an
end to nuclear testing, chemical and biological arms ban and the
strengthening of the United Nations.
   The women were joined by Greenpeace, who held a news conference
urging the ban on naval nuclear and strategic naval weapons. The
Greenpeace activists said they would try to interfere with an
impending Trident II missile test off the coast of Cape Canaveral,
Fla.
   Other groups with delegations include the National Conference
for Soviet Jewry, and the Maltese Labor Party _ presently out of
power in the Maltese grovernment _ which organized a peace concert
in a Valletta Hall and promised a rally for Sunday if and when the
weather improved.

<HEAD>Bulgarian Leadership Condemns 1968 Invasion of Czechoslovakia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New reform-minded Communist Party leaders
have condemned the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in
which Bulgarian troops took part, the state-run news agency BTA
said Saturday.
   Each of the five Warsaw Pact nations that joined in the invasion
of their neighbor has recently criticized the operation. Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday called the invasion an
``inappropriate response.''
   The ruling party Politburo and the government studied the issue
and noted that the decision to crush Czechoslovakia's ``Prague
Spring'' reforms was conditioned by the international situation at
the end of the 1960s, BTA said.
   BTA said that situation was ``characterized by confrontation,
armament races and relentless ideological fighting.'' The Warsaw
Pact decision to send tanks and troops was influenced by ``deformed
concepts of socialist society.
   ``Looking back from today's point of view,'' BTA said, ``and
from the positions of restructuring and new political thinking, the
action taken in August 1968 is assessed as unjustifiable and
illegal.
   ``History has proved it to be wrong and incompatible with the
new course of the Bulgarian Communist Party and the Bulgarian
state,'' said BTA, which reflects government policy.
   Referring to the moves toward democratization in Czechoslovakia,
BTA said ``the dynamic processes which have been recently triggered
in Czechoslovakia are received in Bulgaria with understanding and
sympathy.''
   Led by the Soviet Union, every Warsaw Pact nation except Romania
took part in the 1968 invasion, which crushed democratic reforms
and led to the installation of hard-line Communist leaders.
   The invasion recently has been condemned by leaders of Hungary,
Poland and East Germany, as well as Czechoslovakia.
   Bulgaria's longtime hard-line Communist Party chief Todor
Zhivkov was ousted on Nov. 10 and replaced by Petar Mladenov, who
is considered more moderate.

   A man holed himself up in his brother's variety

his temple and threatening to kill himself, police said.
   Herberto Figueroa, 35, finally gave himself up about 3:30 p.m.
Friday after speaking with two officers of the police negotiation
team. No shots were fired and no injuries were reported.
   Figueroa, who was freed on bail, faces charges of unlawful
possession of a firearm at arraignment in Roxbury District Court,
expected on Monday, police said.
   Police ordered the store and apartments above it evacuated and
blocked off a 30-foot area around the store while they negotiated.
   Figueroa has a history of suicide attempts and had been
previously hospitalized, officials said.

<TEXT>
   A member of Yugoslavia's collective
presidency said multiparty democracy is bound to prevail in this
Communist-ruled nation, a Zagreb daily reported Saturday.
   Stipe Suvar, the Croatian republic's representative in the
eight-person Yugoslav presidency, was quoted as saying Communism
``is heading for the reconstruction of political (freedoms) that
will certainly result in a multiparty system.''
   His comments were in an interview carried in the Vjesnik daily
newspaper.
   ``I would prefer for two parties to emerge ... and to creatively
compete,'' he was quoted as saying, adding that ``even if the
present Communist Party were to disintegrate, a new party would
eventually emerge in its ashes.''
   He also blasted the republic of Serbia for severing ties with
the more liberal republic of Slovenia, the newspaper reported.
   Mass Serbian rallies ``cannot make Yugoslavia a happier place,''
he was quoted as saying.
   In an unprecedented move, the leadership of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
largest republic, broke off all business and government contacts
with Slovenia Wednesday after authorities there banned the rally by
an estimated 40,000 Serbs. They were reportedly seeking the ouster
of Slovenia's liberal leadership.
   Yugoslavia consists of six republics and two autonomous
provinces, each with its own government and party structure.
   The decentralized system of government and a collective federal
presidency were devised to prevent one republic from gaining sway
over the others, but it has often resulted in tensions and
ineffective government by compromise.
   In the interview, Suvar also described the current
counterrevolutionary activities trial of Azem Vlasi, a former
leader of hard-line Serbia's southern province of Kosovo, as
``unnecessary and harmful'' for Yugoslavia. He called for Vlasi's
release.
   In Yugoslavia's largest political trial in decades, Vlasi and 14
other ethnic Albanian defendants are accused of opposing Serbia in
its drive to strengthen its control over the impoverished province.
   Kosovo has been the scene of continuing unrest that left at
least 28 people dead this year.
   Ethnic Albanians, who make up almost nine-tenths of the region's
1.9 million people, are seeking greater autonomy for their
province. Serbia exercises some control over Kosovo, though it is
nominally autonomous.
   Vlasi's trial has been sharply criticized in Slovenia and by
international human rights groups.

   Hundreds of Israeli troops
seized uniforms, hatchets and homemade swords on Saturday during
house-to-house searches in an area where the army had killed four
armed Palestinians.
   At least 30 Arabs were detained during the operation, which came
one day after soldiers clashed with seven members of a Palestinian
gang called the Black Panthers outside a barber shop in the Casbah
quarter of Nablus. Four Palestinians were slain during the clash.
   In the Gaza Strip on Saturday, Israeli soldiers shot and wounded
23 Palestinians during a sympathy strike for the four, Arab reports
said.
   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai on Saturday blamed the Black
Panthers for killing 16 Palestinians suspected of collaborating
with Israel and said its activities were directed by Yasser
Arafat's Fatah faction of the PLO.
   Since the start of the Palestinian uprising, underground groups
known as ``strike forces'' and ``popular committees'' have been
formed to enforce orders of its PLO-backed leadership. Some of
these groups have gradually focused on violent interrogations and
killings of suspected collaborators as a main activity.
   In the past four months of his command, Mordechai said 130
hard-core activists had been arrested from groups such as the Black
Panthers and Red Eagles, which have used weapons in attacks on
Israeli soldiers and killed Palestinians suspected of having ties
to Israeli authorities.
   The use of weapons contradicts PLO policy against using arms in
the nearly 2-year-old Palestinian uprising.
   Recent leaflets from the pro-PLO underground criticized the
slaying of alleged collaborators and disowned the renegade actions
of unauthorized groups.
   Some 154 Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs, while 624
Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the uprising.
   The latest death came Saturday when Hamad Jaber, 20, of the West
Bank village of Tayasir, died of wounds suffered in a clash with
troops three weeks ago.
   Mordechai spoke at the site of Friday's shootout outside Kamal's
Salon, a barber shop in the Casbah quarter, where 30,000
Palestinians live.
   Bloodstains, broken window panes and shards of porcelain coffee
cup were seen. An army officer said slain Black Panther leader Imad
Nasser, 29, was holding the cup when soldiers approached the group.
   Across the street, two Palestinian men in their 20s kneeled
against a graffiti-covered wall, hands bound behind their backs and
blindfolded.
   Army officers said more than 30 Palestinians were detained
Saturday. Unofficial reports estimated the number of detainees at
60 to 100.
   ``I think the people of Nablus will be be grateful to hear that
this group is under control,'' said Mordechai, who claimed to have
documents linking the Black Panthers to senior Fatah officials.
``Behind this group are high-level PLO officials supporting, giving
money and encouraging them.''
   ``There is no serious group left operating in this area,'' said
Col. Raanan Gissin, deputy army spokesman who guided reporters on a
tour of the Casbah, where a curfew kept residents off the streets.
   Reporters were taken to a secondary school where soldiers had
collected dozens of knives and swords, piles of uniforms, outlawed
PLO flags, slingshots, posters of Arafat, wooden clubs and axes.
   According to witness accounts from Arab reporters, Israeli
forces disguised as Arabs and wearing Arab headdresses arrived
Friday in a red Mercedes with distinctive blue West Bank license
plates. They surprised the Black Panthers in the barber shop and
opened fire.
   Mordechai described that account as a ``tall story.'' He said
the soldiers were in uniform and arrived on foot after being
alerted by an army lookout.
   Gissin said two Palestinians were killed on the spot and two
died of wounds later. He said one of those killed tried to grab the
gun of an Israeli soldier. Bloodstains mark the spot where he died.
   Drops of blood were also visible where three Black Panthers were
wounded.
   ``In these kind of clashes, you have to fire first if you want
to survive,'' Gissin said. ``The soldiers had no choice but to draw
fast and fire first.''
   Mordechai said the Palestnians did not get off a shot, but other
officers said one Palestinian weapon had a bullet in the chamber,
ready to fire.

   More than 13 years after a car bomb killed an
investigative reporter for Arizona's largest newspaper, the murder
case has been reopened even though the motive is as murky as ever.
   When Attorney General Bob Corbin leans back and puts his cowboy
boots on the desk in his Old West-style office, he can choose from
a tangle of theories about who ordered the death of Arizona
Republic reporter Don Bolles.
   There's the mob. Casinos. Race track owners. Bankers. Even a
jealous ex-husband. And there are plots within plots. One theory is
that the hit men collected twice, from different people. So far,
though, only one man has been convicted, and the masterminds,
whoever they were, remain free.
   Corbin, a Republican whose office comes up for election next
year, has been attacked by potential challengers for not solving
the case. But he insists those attacks were not a factor in his
decision to reinstate a murder charge last week against James
Robison, a plumber accused of setting off the bomb.
   Corbin says he has ``new evidence'' but won't say what it is or
where it points.
   ``You don't need motive for a conviction,'' he said. ``It helps
... but I don't need to show motive.''
   Bolles, 47, died 11 days after the radio-controlled bomb blew up
his car in a hotel parking lot in June 1976. As he lay dying, he
was heard to say ``John Adamson,'' ``Emprise'' and ``Mafia.''
   Emprise Corp., now known as Delaware North Companies Ltd., was a
partner with the Funk family of Arizona in dog-racing tracks.
   John Harvey Adamson, 45, who ultimately became the only man
convicted in the case so far, was a greyhound breeder and tow-truck
operator who drank heavily and used cocaine. Bolles had left a note
at his desk saying he was planning to meet him to discuss a
land-fraud scheme involving high-level politicians.
   At trial, Adamson testified in return for leniency, saying he
planted the car bomb and Robison triggered it on orders from Max
Dunlap, a man trying to ingratiate himself with land and liquor
magnate Kemper Marley.
   Marley, a target of Bolles' stories, was never charged with the
crime, however, and an appeals court threw out the Robison and
Dunlap convictions. Dunlap was released, though Robison, 67,
remains in prison on an unrelated assault conviction.
   Corbin decided to drop charges against Robison and Dunlap when
Adamson refused to testify in a retrial unless he got a better deal
than he originally bargained for. Corbin, arguing that Adamson had
broken the plea bargain, brought him to trial and won a murder
conviction and death sentence he hoped would persuade Adamson to
talk.
   A federal appeals court threw out Adamson's death sentence
earlier this year, however, and Corbin filed a new murder charge
against Robison last week without waiting for further appeals to be
heard by the Supreme Court. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for
January.
   Separately, a state grand jury is investigating potential
obstruction of justice charges and has called in witnesses that
could fit several of the scenarios.
   Several people, including free-lance reporter Don Devereux, have
theorized that Bolles may have been killed because he was
investigating industrial gold thefts and their ties to California
bankers.
   Devereux and others have suggested Bolles was looking at
dog-track skimming, however, and they cite his dying words.
   Still others have linked the death to a ``Mafia diary'' that
describes casino skimming, but that some contend is a forgery.
   And some, including Corbin at one time, have pointed to a member
of the Funk family as a ``contingency suspect,'' saying he resented
his ex-wife's closeness with Bolles, whom she confided in.
   Some of the theories overlap, and there are those who believe
the hit men may have been paid originally by one person before
persuading a second who didn't know about the first contract to pay
for it too.
   Adamson declined to be interviewed last week, and Robison
referred a reporter to his attorney, who did not return calls.
   The reopening of the case pleased those close to Bolles.
   His brother Richard, an author, said: ``I'd just like to know
the truth.''
   John Winters, a Bolles colleague who still covers the case,
said: ``You at least have some activity going on in the case.''

<HEAD>East German Ambassador Apologizes for Treatment of Poles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The East German ambassador apologized on
behalf of his government for poor treatment of Poles in East
Germany during an unusual address Saturday on Polish national
television.
   ``In the name of my government, I want to apologize to all Poles
who suffered troubles, like damage to their property, insults,
undignified treatment,'' said Juergen Van Zwoll in his five-minute
speech.
   Speaking Polish, the East German diplomat said the actions
against Poles ``usually grew out of momentary emotions,
nervousness, excitement _ but sometimes also on the unhealthy soil
of nationalism.''
   Nazi Germany, along with the Soviet Union, invaded Poland at the
outbreak of World War II in September 1939.
   Earlier this week, Polish media reported that Poles in East
Germany were being harrassed at food stores, refused meals in
restaurants, and suffering attacks on their property.
   The Polish government sent a delegation led by Boguslaw Miernik,
a senior Foreign Ministry official, to East Berlin on Nov. 28 to
investigate, the official PAP news agency said.
   Miernik told reporters Saturday he had informed the East German
government that the Polish government would not tolerate
discriminatory acts against Polish citizens in East Germany, PAP
said.

<UNK>Bush Asks Soviets To Join In Backing 2004 Olympic Bid for Berlin</UNK>

<TEXT>
   President Bush urged Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday to join the United States in
proposing that the 2004 Olympics be held in Berlin, a U.S. official
said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Olympic proposal was among the subjects Bush raised on the first
day of his summit talks with Gorbachev. The discussions were
scheduled for a Soviet missile cruiser, but moved to the Soviet
liner Maxim Gorky because of bad weather.
   Berlin as a site for the Olympics was suggested by
then-President Ronald Reagan, at a time when the Berlin Wall _
symbol of Europe's division _ seemed to rule out any possibility.
Reagan did not propose a date.
   The idea of bidding for the 2004 games surged in Germany
immediately after the East Berlin government's decision Nov. 9 to
ease travel restrictions on its citizens and to cut new crossings
in the wall, allowing millions of East Germans to visit West Berlin
freely.
   Four West German cities preparing to bid for the 2004 summer
Olympics immediately said they would drop their applications if
Berlin were to become a candidate.

   The Central American country of Belize braced for
Tropical Storm Karen, spinning clockwise around the western
Caribbean with 40 mph winds, forecaster said Saturday.
   Storm warnings were lifted for Cuba, which was drenched with
rain before the rare, but weak, late-season tropical storm veered
south. The government of Belize extended a tropical storm watch
from its offshore islands to the entire country Saturday, the
National Hurricane Center said.
   At 5 p.m. EST, Karen's center was near 17.4 degrees north
latitude and 85.7 degrees west longitude, about 160 miles east of
Belize City, after being stationary for much of Saturday.
   A strong frontal trough was expected to push the storm toward
the northeast and deeper into the Caribbean, but no significant
change in strength was expected, said officials at the hurricane
center in suburban Coral Gables.
   On Thursday, the system surprised forecasters by reaching
tropical storm strength, defined as a storm with winds above 39
mph. At its peak, Karen's top winds hitting 55 mph.
   Reports from Cuba said Karen dumped more than 14 inches of rain
on Punta del Este on the Isle of Youth, more than 7 inches in
Matanzas and nearly 5 inches in Havana.
   While the hurricane season officially starts June 1 and ends
Nov. 30, hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.
   Belize is on the northeast coast of Central America and has a
population of 160,000.

   At the Sea Goddess Temple on Saturday, Li
Ying-shi tossed the wood blocks once, twice, three times.
   ``That's it,'' said the grizzled fisherman. ``Sea Goddess says
no voting today.''
   As he hobbled away, a young woman in a blue dress took his place
in front of the altar, facing an image of the fetching goddess.
   ``I've never voted before,'' she said with a shy smile after
tossing the blocks, a Buddhist ritual. ``I needed advice.''
   Indeed, for the first time in Taiwan's history, a legal
opposition party has given voters something close to real choice in
the first nationwide elections since martial law was lifted in 1987.
   Long lines formed at polling booths throughout the island.
   ``We've been going full steam since 8 a.m.,'' said one police
officer at a polling station near the Sea Goddess Temple in
northern Taipei. ``It's just getting busier.''
   As he spoke, three elderly women moved slowly out of the voting
booth.
   ``We choose the opposition,'' said one, as she stood between her
two sisters clutching their hands. ``We talked about it last night
and decided to vote our mind. The people must speak.''
   The opposition, or Democratic Progressive Party, ran a spirited
campaign against the ruling Nationalist Party, which has governed
Taiwan since 1949 when it fled mainland China after losing a civil
war to the Communists.
   The DPP finds its strength mostly among the Taiwanese working
class who were here when the mainlanders came over from China.
   The opposition portrayed the Nationalists as corrupt, accusing
them of vote-buying and using state-run television to push
Nationalist candidates.
   The Nationalists depicted the opposition as a chaotic band of
radicals, ready to proclaim Taiwan's cultural and political
independence from China.
   The issue was an emotional one because China has warned it could
attack Taiwan if this island of 20 million proclaims independence.
It also cut to the heart of the Nationalists claim on power. Ever
since fleeing to Taiwan, the Nationalists have said they alone are
the legitimate government of China.
   Hugh G. Chang, an 83-year-old retired Ministry of Finance
official, fled to Taiwan in 1948 to help set up a government for
the beleagured Nationalists and their leader Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek.
   After years of supporting Chiang's martial law policies, Chang
said he now he supports political liberalization.
   ``But slowly, slowly,'' he said, banging his cane on the
pavement. His grandson, Chang Yin-lien agreed.
   ``Instability is a bad thing,'' said the 25-year-old law student
who voted for the Nationalists with his grandfather in western
Taipei. ``We want calm for Taiwan.''
   Their viewpoint is common among Taiwan's people, strongly
influenced by Confucian ethics that worship harmony.
   Still, some voters said they didn't agree.
   ``A little turmoil may not be a bad thing,'' said one voter
after casting his ballot for the opposition. ``It's like marriage.
If you don't argue, you never make up.''

<HEAD>Alyssa's Condition Improving, Second Girl Awaits Surgery</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 21-month-old girl was drinking liquids, growing
more alert and doing well Saturday, five days after becoming the
nation's first living-donor liver-transplant recipient, a hospital
spokesman said.
   While Alyssa Smith recovered with her mother, who gave the child
part of her liver Monday, surgeons at the University of Chicago
Medical Center were deciding whether a 15-month-old Tennessee girl
could undergo a similar operation.
   ``Doctors will continue to evaluate and assess the options and
decide whether she still fits the protocol for a living-donor''
liver transplant, said spokesman John Easton.
   Sarina Jones of Millington, Tenn., remained in serious condition
in the hospital's intensive care unit, a day after she was flown in
by air ambulance and taken by helicopter to the hospital, Easton
said.
   Sarina suffered from an infection recently, and was not
considered an immediate candidate for surgery.
   ``It doesn't look like it's going to be this weekend,'' said
medical center spokeswoman Mary Fetsch. ``It's tentatively set for
Wednesday.''
   Sarina's parents, Robert, 20, and Michelle, 21, who live near
Memphis, arrived Friday night, a few hours after their daughter.
   ``They said our chances were small, but they're still chances,''
said the father, a dry-wall installer and contractor.
   He is expected to act as donor for his blond, blue-eyed
daughter, who became a transplant candidate almost a year ago but
whose parents became frustrated waiting for a suitable organ in the
Memphis area.
   Both little girls suffered from biliary atresia, a usually fatal
genetic disorder involved in more liver transplants than other
ailments.
   Sarina's condition was more advanced than Alyssa's, however,
even though Alyssa had also waited a year after becoming a
transplant candidate, Ms. Fetsch said Friday.
   Alyssa's mother, 29-year-old schoolteacher Teresa Smith, was in
good condition Saturday while recuperating from the operation, in
which she donated the left lobe of her liver, Easton said.
   ``Mom's doing well,'' Easton said. ``I imagine she's still in
some discomfort. But she's not having any complications.''
   The girl's father, John L. Smith, 27, an assistant shipping
supervisor, has been at the hospital this week with his wife and
daughter, as well as the couple's 3-year-old son, Richard.
   The Smiths, of Schertz, Texas, near San Antonio, are the first
people to participate in a living-donor transplant in the United
States, which followed a total of four such procedures in other
countries _ Brazil, Australia and Japan. One child has died.
   The University of Chicago developed its living-donor
liver-transplant program, in which it hopes to perform the surgery
on 20 patients within 12 months, partly as a response to the
shortage of available organs from children's cadavers for
youngsters who need liver transplants. An estimated 25 to 50
percent of children who need liver transplants die without them.
   Dr. Christoph Broelsch, who led the surgical team in Monday's
operation on Alyssa, pioneered the technique of transplanting part
of adult organs into youngsters, whose abdominal cavities are too
small to hold a whole adult liver.

   The memory of four previous riots this decade hangs
over Miami as the racially charged manslaughter trial of a
policeman nears its end, but this time there is hope the bloodshed
can be avoided.
   ``I've got a very good feeling about it,'' Miami's Mayor Xavier
Suarez said Friday after a visit to an school in a predominantly
black neighborhood. ``I think a couple of blacks on the jury _
that's very helpful. The process is going to be viewed this time as
complex, but fair.''
   Barring last-minute delays, the case of officer William Lozano,
31, accused of manslaughter in the deaths of a black motorcyclist
and his passenger, is expected to go to the six-member jury later
this week. The trial was recessed on Friday until Monday.
   Lozano faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of Clement
Lloyd, 23, and Lloyd's passenger, Allan Blanchard, 24. Lozano shot
Lloyd in the head, killing him instantly. Blanchard, also black,
died the next day of head injuries suffered in the subsequent crash.
   Four times since 1980 _ including the Jan. 16 shooting that led
to the current trial _ racial disturbances were touched off by
violent encounters between police and blacks, or by the subsequent
acquittal of the officers by all-white juries.
   Willie Sims, a black member of Dade County's Community Relations
Board, says he has felt the difference participation in the legal
system makes in the community's reaction.
   ``You have blacks on the jury, you have a black prosecutor,''
says Sims. ``It definitely goes a long way toward defusing the
situation _ you reduce the perception of unfairness.''
   Another difference is that the local media have given almost
blanket coverage of the trial. The school district's television
station WLRN runs a complete tape of the day's proceedings each
night. Radio station WINZ-AM interrupts its programming with live
broadcasts from the trial. Several commercial television
broadcasters _ including Cable News Network nationally _ carried
Lozano's appearance live on Thursday.
   The media have acted more responsibly than before the previous
riots, asserts Marvin Dunn, a prominent black sociologist and
author of a book on the May 1980 riot that left 18 people dead.
That violence followed the acquittal of policemen accused of
beating to death black insurance executive Arthur McDuffie.
   ``I just don't have a sense of any tremendous support for a riot
in the wake of an acquittal,'' Dunn says. ``In going around the
community, you don't hear the same level of anger as before the
McDuffie riot. ... There is an overwhelming sentiment in the
community for peace.''
   Another difference is that unlike 1980, the city police are
ready this time if there is unrest.
   The department has 700 new gas masks and two armored vehicles,
and has upgraded shields, batons and other equipment, says police
spokesman David Rivero. Police will move in quickly at the first
sign of trouble.
   ``We have a major plan where every policeman in this entire
department has an assignment,'' Rivero says. ``We are going to put
everybody in jail who breaks the law.''
   But not everyone shares the optimism of local officials, or
feels that two black jurors will be enough to prevent violence in
case of an acquittal.
   At the Nu Lounge _ a bar only 100 feet or so from where Lozano
shot Lloyd _ many patrons fear the trial will end in a replay of
what they see as a long history of injustice.
   ``Since 1919 until today, it's been the same _ `Get the
nigger,''' says Joseph Williams, 72, a lifelong resident of the
community. He mentions the McDuffie case and the 1982 shooting of
Nevell Johnson, a black, in a video arcade only a few blocks away,
which both sparked rioting.
   In 1984, violence broke out again when an all-white jury
acquitted Miami police officer Luis Alvarez in Johnson's shooting.
   ``All these things make the guy in the street feel like `a
policeman can kill me because I'm black,''' says Ivory Lewis, a
former policeman and now a longshoreman. ``That's why people want a
guilty verdict, so they feel our children's lives are worth
something.''
   While attention has focused on black neighborhoods where the
riots took place, the case also has riveted the attention of south
Florida's Hispanic community _ especially the 200,000 Colombians
who constitute the region's second-largest Latin ethnic group,
after Cuban-Americans.
   Even in Lozano's homeland of Colombia, news of the trial is
carried in detail by the media, and a fund-raising drive has helped
pay the expenses of his legal defense.
   Support for the policeman is widespread, says Dario Restrepo, a
member of Florida's official Commission on Hispanic Affairs and
governor of the Colombian American Chamber of Commerce.
   Lozano's brothers and his wife are all law enforcement officers,
he notes _ a welcome relief to a nationality whose country has
become synonymous with cocaine trafficking.

   President Bush proposed to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Saturday that NATO and the Warsaw
Pact conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in Europe next
year and sign the accord at an international summit meeting in
Vienna, U.S. officials said.
   The proposal was part of a presentation on arms control, trade,
human rights and other U.S.-Soviet issues that Bush outlined at the
opening round of talks with Gorbachev at their storm-tossed summit,
according to officials who asked not to be identified by name.
   Bush also suggested that Secretary of State James A. Baker III
and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze meet next month
in the Soviet Union to resolve several key issues blocking
agreement on a separate treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet long-range
nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent, the officials said.
   That pact would be signed at a superpower summit to be held in
the United States, which Bush suggested be held in the second half
of June, according to officials.
   The recommendations extended to a call for the two summit
partners to jointly propose Berlin as the site for the Olympic
Games in 2004 _ a gesture that would dramatize the improvement in
East-West relations.
   On the negative side, Bush told Gorbachev the continued delivery
of Soviet arms to leftist rebels in El Salvador through surrogates
was the single most destructive factor in the superpower
relationship, said the officials.
   The U.S. officials said Gorbachev did not respond directly to
any of Bush's initiatives. Presumably, the response, at least in
part, would come on Sunday during a final day of talks.
   On the arms-control front, officials said that Bush was willing
to end production of U.S. chemical weapons once an international
treaty is put into operation to ban poison gas.
   On trade issues, the officials said Bush told the Soviet leader
the United States would support granting Moscow observer status in
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 97-nation trade
organization, once the Kremlin eases emigration restrictions, as it
has promised.
   Bush also proposed negotiations begin on a trade agreement that
would also lift tariff and import controls against Soviet goods
entering the United States, the official said.
   The trade restrictions were imposed by Congress in the mid-1970s
with the aim of forcing the exodus of Soviet Jews. The official
made clear that Bush's offers were conditional, based on completion
of Soviet legislation to establish freedom of travel. Completion of
that landmark law is expected within a month.
   One of the restrictive U.S. laws, known as the Jackson-Vanik
Amendment, has for many years denied the Soviet Union the kind of
access to U.S. markets enjoyed by most other nations by imposing
high tariffs. The other legislation, known as the Stevenson
Amendment, denies export credits to Moscow.
   Apart from imminent action on emigration, the Soviet Union is in
the midst of reconstructing its economy under Gorbachev's
perestroika campaign.
   A U.S. official said that Bush urged Gorbachev to move toward a
market-pricing system. But he gave no indication how Gorbachev
responded to any of the President's propositions. But Gorbachev is
known to want Soviet entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (GATT).
   Bush proposed only observer status for the Soviets _ not full
membership. It would be granted next year, the official said.
   Bush's proposal for an international summit in Vienna follows
one by Gorbachev last week to have the leaders of the United
States, Canada and 33 European countries meet next year to ease
East-West divisions.
   The treaty that would be signed is under negotiation in the
Austrian capital between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. It would reduce
U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe to 275,000 each and also cut
tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons from the Atlantic
Ocean to the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   The two key obstacles at this point concern what kinds of
airplanes to scale back and whether to include a Turkish port
through which supplies flow to Turkish troops on Cyprus.
   The strategic arms reduction treaty, known as START, is under
negotiation in Geneva between the United States and the Soviet
Union.
   Bush said Baker and Shevardnadze should focus on such nagging
problems as how many nuclear-tipped air-launched cruise missiles to
be permitted, whether missiles not deployed on bombers, submarines
or in silos should be scrapped and measures to prevent the
disguising of missile tests.
   In the area of human right, Bush told Gorbachev that ``all
outstanding human rights cases'' should be resolved before that
meeting, an official said.
   He presented a list of cases to the Soviet leader. The number
was not disclosed.

<HEAD>Ukrainian Church Leader Urges Catholics to Officially Register</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of the Ukrainian Catholic Church urged
millions of faithful in the Soviet Ukraine on Saturday to take
advantage of new concessions allowing them to register with
authorities.
   ``We have prayed for this day for over 43 years, and God has
answered our prayers,'' Rome-based Cardinal Myroslav Lubachivsky
said. ``Our suffering is coming to an end.''
   Lubachivsky was referring to Friday's announcement by government
officials in the Ukraine that Ukrainian Catholics could officially
register their congregations like other religious groups. The
church has been banned since 1946.
   The move came as Pope John Paul II was holding historic talks at
the Vatican with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I call upon our faithful in Ukraine to avail themselves of
this right and to begin to register our congregations with
authorities as soon as possible,'' Lubachivsky said in a statement.
   He described the decision by Ukrainian officials as a ``first
step'' toward complete legalization of the church, which was
suppressed by dictator Josef Stalin in 1946 and forced to merge
with the Russian Orthodox Church.
   According to Western estimates, there are 4 million to 6 million
Catholics in the Ukraine. Until recently, they practiced their
faith clandestinely, but in recent months many have emerged to
worship openly and demand official recognition.
   The pope on Friday urged Gorbachev to assure full religious
freedom for the Ukrainian church and all Soviet Catholics,
estimated at 10 million. Gorbachev pledged that a new law
guaranteeing religious freedom for all faiths would be adopted soon
and he invited the pope to visit the country.
   ``We extend our sincere and deep gratitude to (the pope) for his
unwavering support of our church,'' said Lubachivsky, former
Metropolitan-Archbishop of Philadelphia.
   He urged Ukrainian Catholics to ``work patiently and according
to the law with the authorities'' and to respect the churches now
controlled by the Russian Orthodox Church.
   The Russian Orthodox have opposed legalization of the Ukrainian
Catholic Church. They stand to lose hundreds of churches and
thousands of followers they gained with the suppression of the
Catholics.

   A private investigator who secretly
distributed Bibles behind the Iron Curtain for nearly 15 years says
he's happy that religious reforms in the Soviet bloc may end his
days as a smuggler for God.
   ``I've been able to smuggle in $2.5 million in Scriptures since
the middle 1970s,'' Ted Grevers said. ``The days of smuggling are
over.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev pledged Friday to Pope John Paul
II that he would establish diplomatic ties with the Vatican and
guarantee religious freedom in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev said
people ``have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs.''
   ``Many Christians behind the Iron Curtain have been praying for
this for years,'' Grevers said. ``I didn't think this was going to
happen. It's a tremendous milestone.''
   Grevers, a former elder of the Cascade Christian Church in Grand
Rapids who owns Fatman International Private Detective Service,
says he has made about 30 trips behind the Iron Curtain to
distribute Bibles and medicine. He says he has smuggled bibles into
the Soviet Union, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.
   ``The Bibles were taken in by car, barge, train, some with
tourists. All material was given to me by various missions
throughout the U.S. and Germany on an anonymous basis,'' he said.
   ``For instance, some trucks going from the West to the East
would be delivering food and other goods. Some drivers would be
Christians and help us,'' Grevers said. ``There are many ingenious
ways you can penetrate these countries.''
   Grevers, whose church is part of the Disciples of Christ
denomination, said he received most of his financial backing from
Amish and Mennonite churches in northern Indiana.
   In the past year, Grevers said, he and others have been allowed
to mail Bibles into the Soviet Union. But Romania and Albania,
which have resisted the wave of liberalization sweeping the rest of
the East bloc, remain difficult to penetrate, he said.
   ``Now we're concentrating on shipping several truckloads of
medicine through our church contacts,'' he said. The medicine is
distributed to Baptist Union Church in Warsaw, Poland, then sent to
various Christian denominations, a Jewish group, a Roman Catholic
convent and various nursing homes, he said.

<HEAD>Eds: SUBS one graf for graf 6 pvs `Eric Ramiriz...' to RESTORE dropped

<TEXT>
   Eden Pastora, the daring Sandinista
guerrilla leader known as Commander Zero who switched sides to the
Contra rebels, returns Sunday to resume his fight, this time on the
political field.
   Pastora will join others who gave up the armed struggle and now
are seeking power through Nicaragua's Feb. 25 general elections.
   ``I am going to Nicaragua because everybody knows me and my
military and political career. I am going to tell the people what
is best for them. I am like the phoenix that rises from his
ashes,'' he said by telephone last week from Costa Rica.
   However, the arrival of the charismatic former Sandinista vice
minister of defense is expected to add little more than spice to
the campaign.
   Pastora has pledged to support the small Social Christian Party
by attacking the two main political blocs _ the Sandinista Front
and the National Opposition Union, known as UNO.
   Eric Ramirez, the Social Christian presidential candidate, is
expected to finish a distant third. Independent polls and political
observers give Sandinista President Daniel Ortega an edge over the
UNO's Violeta Chamorro in his bid for re-election.
   But adversity will not stop the fiery Pastora, who says he has
survived because Jesus is on his side.
   ``His arrival represents an option for a solution that rejects
war and Marxism and seeks to rescue the true values of the
revolution that overthrew (Anastasio) Somoza,'' Ramirez said.
   Others disagree.
   ``The man is a guerrilla. All he knows how to do is fight. He
has no political ideology,'' said Jaime Chamorro, assistant
director of the opposition newspaper La Prensa, which backs his
mother. Mrs. Chamorro is the newspaper's director.
   The Sandinistas hope Pastora's charisma has worn out.
   Pastora, 52, has been working in Costa Rica on a fishing
cooperative with members of his former guerrilla band since 1986,
when he gave up the fight.
   He became known worldwide Aug. 20, 1978, when he led 20 rebels
in a daring assault on the National Palace. The rebels held scores
of congressmen hostage until they obtained the release of 50
Sandinistas held in the prisons of then-President Somoza.
   Among those released was a young rebel, Daniel Ortega, who went
on to become president and Tomas Borge, now interior minister.
   A photograph of Pastora smiling and holding a rifle aloft as he
boarded the plane that took his comrades out the country was a
great propaganda boost for the Sandinista cause.
   He led the Sandinistas' southern guerrilla front and in July
1979 marched into Managua with the victorious forces to become vice
minister ofdefense and one of the most popular Sandinista leaders.
   But Pastora always called himself a nationalist and never
identified entirely with radical leftist colleagues in the
Sandinista leadership. They in turn considered him a politically
unstable man with more guts than brains.
   In 1983, Pastora disappeared from public view. Months later he
announced he was taking up arms against the Sandinistas, accusing
them of betraying the revolution and trying to establish a Marxist
regime.
   Pastora organized a guerrilla force along the Costa Rican border
and admitted he was getting some covert funds from the U.S.
government.
   A master of the surprise attack, he briefly took over the
Pacific port town of San Juan del Sur.
   In 1984, he was wounded in a bomb attempt at a jungle hideout in
southern Nicaragua during a news conference to which he had invited
a large number of journalists.
   The CIA withdrew financial support from his group in 1986. He
accused the United States of giving all its support to the Contra
groups led by former Somoza National Guard officers.
   ``We want a movement that is free of influence from the United
States and from Moscow,'' Pastora said last week.
   He dismissed Mrs. Chamorro as ``an honorable woman worthy of all
respect, but not a politician. She is being used by the extreme
right just as she was was used by the extreme left.''
   Mrs. Chamorro, whose husband was murdered by the Somoza
government, served on the first Sandinista junta before resigning
after a year.
   Pastora will be able to campaign but not vote because he did not
register in October.

   A glass and bronze lotus lamp sold at Sotheby's
Saturday for $1.76 million, a record price for a 20th century
decorative work of art, the auction house said.
   The lamp by the French artists Daum Nancy and Louis Majorelle
had been expected to bring $500,000 to $600,000, said Sotheby's
spokeswoman Laura Stewart.
   Each of its three sockets supports a mold-blown, wheel-carved
glass shade in pink and green, with the largest in the shape of a
lotus blossom and the other two molded as lotus buds. It was made
about 1900.
   A lamp by Emile Galle sold for $1.1 million, a record for the
French artist, Stewart said. The price was within the pre-sale
estimate.
   The 1902 lamp, known as ``Les Coprins'' (The Mushrooms), is made
of internally decorated and intaglio-carved glass and wrought iron.
   The buyers and sellers asked not to be identified, Stewart said.
The prices include the auction house's 10 percent commission.

   Sammy Davis Jr., the self-described ``saloon
entertainer,'' will receive the NAACP Hall of Fame Award at the
Image Awards ceremony this week, a day after his 64th birthday.
   Actor-director Sidney Poitier will bequeath the honor Saturday
to the tap-dancing singer and actor who has spent 60 years in the
entertainment industry appearing on Broadway, television and in
movies.
   The Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People said in a statement Friday
that ``despite a career that his peers and public alike would
classify as nothing less than legendary, Davis refers to himself
simply as a `saloon entertainer.'''
   The performer, who is undergoing radiation treatment for throat
cancer, served as grand marshal of the Hollywood Christmas Parade
last Sunday and was recently honored in a television special for
his years in show business.
   Born to vaudevillian parents on Dec. 8, 1925, Davis was a child
performer and later became known as a member of Hollywood's young
``Rat Pack'' of entertainers, which included Frank Sinatra, Dean
Martin and Peter Lawford.

   The man who introduced PTL founder Jim
Bakker and former church secretary Jessica Hahn was charged with
drunken driving twice within four hours by the same officer,
according to police reports.
   John Wesley Fletcher, 49, was first arrested shortly before 10
p.m. Thursday when he was charged with driving while impaired,
careless and reckless driving and driving with a revoked license,
police reports said.
   He registered .20 on the breath test, twice the legal
intoxication limit. Fletcher was released under $1,000 bond,
officials said.
   At 1:55 a.m. Friday, Fletcher was charged with driving while
impaired and driving with a revoked license. He recorded .15 on the
breath test and was then freed under $2,000 bond, police said.
   Fletcher is a former Durham ambulance driver-turned-evangelist
who returned here in late April. His phone number was not listed
and he could not be reached for comment.
   Fletcher said in an August interview that he was seeking
forgiveness, self-worth and a new career after the role he played
in the events that toppled Bakker from the PTL television ministry.
   The sexual encounter between Bakker and Ms. Hahn in a Clearwater
Beach, Fla., motel in 1980 became public in March 1987 and wrecked
Bakker's television ministry. Bakker has since been convicted of 24
counts of fraud and conspiracy and is serving a 45-year term in a
federal prison in Minnesota.

<TEXT>
   Just when quake-frazzled San Franciscans
were recovering their equilibrium, the collapse of a construction
crane and other accidents are rattling them all over again.
   Some are crying. Some are laughing so they won't cry.
   Quake jokes have been big on the comedy circuit since the Oct.
17 shaker, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale. Now crane jokes
are starting to make the rounds after the 16-story plunge of a
giant crane last Tuesday that killed five people and injured 21.
   It's hard to feel safe anywhere after a week when, in addition
to the crane accident, a bus and train collided, killing two, and a
street caved in from a broken water main.
   Oddball theories abound on the cause of the troubles.
Astrologers claim the calamities were preordained, based on the
city's ``birth date'' of Jan. 30, 1847, when the pueblo of Yerba
Buena became San Francisco.
   ``San Francisco is moving into a period of bad luck and
disasters, being injured in our tenderest places, while being in a
position of negative publicity and changes in our image,'' said
astrologer Jayj Jacobs.
   The string of bad breaks continued Friday when Mayor Art Agnos
was hit by a big wave and slammed into a beach in Hawaii. Agnos,
who was on the island of Maui to speak about earthquake
preparedness and crisis management, broke his collarbone and will
need to wear a brace for two to three weeks, mayor's spokesman
Scott Shafer said.
   The mayor scoffs at suggestions the city is cursed, but worries
that a disaster a day will keep tourists away.
   The recent accidents, though spectacular, did not result in a
larger number of deaths or injuries than occur daily in many big
cities. But San Francisco, for all its glamour and international
presence, is a relatively small place _ the population is about
one-tenth that of New York _ and events are magnified.
   Crisis hotlines are so busy callers often are put on hold.
Mental health clinics are packed with stressed-out patients, some
afraid to go into tall buildings, cross bridges or ride
double-decker freeways.
   Calls to the suicide prevention and related hotlines for people
with problems such as drugs or marriage troubles were up 30 percent
in the first couple of weeks after the quake, reaching about 260 a
day.
   Though the number of calls has since eased off, the numbers
don't tell the whole story because callers in the past week have
tended to be more upset on average and each takes longer to help,
said Eve Meyer, executive director of San Francisco Suicide
Prevention.
   ``The calls we've been getting this week are more intense ...,''
said Meyer. ``The events this week triggered memories of the quake.
And the fact that this is happening during the start of the holiday
stress season is adding to the anxiety. We've burned out a lot of
volunteers in the last month.''
   If comedy is tragedy plus time, as Alan Alda observes in Woody
Allen's latest film, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' then San
Francisco is getting funnier every day.
   ``Humor is a defense mechanism,'' says comedian Mark Pitta.
``When the quake first happened, there was nothing funny about it.
There was no way I was going to make fun of the Bay Bridge or I-880
collapse. But after a grace period, you could start telling jokes.
Now so many things are happening it's ridiculous.''
   Pitta suggests that ``the networks are going to keep crews out
here all the time just to wait for disasters.''
   The thousands of people complaining of feeling more vulnerable
these days are experiencing a normal reaction, but they should seek
help if the fear gets too intense or lasts more than a couple of
months, psychologists say.
   ``Many people have had trouble sleeping or eating properly,''
said Rosemary Martinez, a social worker and psychological clinician
at the Mission Crisis unit. ``But when they are unable to leave
home because it's the only place they feel safe, at that point they
really need to be seen on an emergency basis.''
   Recent immigrants, the homeless and people dealing with personal
tragedies are more severely affected psychologically by the
disasters, said Dr. Allen Turpin, a psychiatrist who treats many
Soviet immigrants.
   ``It's been really traumatic for them, especially the older and
more recent immigrants,'' Turpin said. ``They still can't sleep
well. It seems everything is still shaking.''
   ``Their lives are unsettled and this exacerbates what they're
already going through.''
   One newcomer to the region has been closer to the disasters than
most, but she's vowing to keep on.
   Joyce Vincentz, a 25-year-old New Jersey native, was aboard a
commuter train that plowed into a chartered bus Monday. The next
morning, she arrived for work in the Financial District minutes
after the 240-ton crane fell onto a busy street.
   After each accident, she called her mother in New Jersey to
assure her she was OK.
   ``After the earthquake, everybody in the East asked me if I was
packing my bags,'' she said. ``I said, `No, it will take more than
an earthquake.' And then I was on the train. So ... my mother asked
if I was going to pack my bags. And I said, `No, it will take more
than that.'''

<TEXT>
   Thousands of Communist Party members jeered
party leader Egon Krenz on Saturday and booed his promises of
change as he appeared at a rally on the eve of meeting that could
lead to changes in the leadership.
   ``We don't believe you anymore!'' party members shouted at Krenz
as he addressed the rally in front of the Central Committee
building in East Berlin.
   The crowd booed and whistled when Krenz promised the party
leadership would thoroughly investigate disclosures of massive
corruption and high living among top party officials.
   ``Too late!'' they shouted.
   Krenz, 52, has been trying desperately to distance himself from
the old hard-line leadership, of which he was a prominent member.
He replaced party leader Erich Honecker on Oct. 18 and began a
campaign to disclose abuse and purge the Old Guard.
   However, immediate reform efforts did not stop the exodus of
thousands to the West and the huge street demonstrations. And
Krenz's support in June for China's crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators has been another obstacle in his effort to win over
the public.
   Krenz's government bowed to pressure Nov. 9 by opening East
German borders and the Berlin Wall to allow citizens to travel
freely. He has denied living opulently, as other leaders did under
Honecker.
   Krenz earlier in the day spoke to his party organization in
Barth, near Rostock, and repeated that he was ready to resign as
party leader if that was what the party rank-and-file wanted.
   ADN reported that several regional party leaders called for
Krenz and the 10-member Politburo to resign and that several
thousand people also took part in opposition-organized rallies in
Rostock and Magdeburg.
   Late Saturday, 15,000 people rallied in the town of Plauen near
the border with West Germany to press for quicker reform and call
for a referendum on German reunification, ADN said.
   The activists also expressed support for a two-hour ``warning
strike'' set for Wednesday to press demands for more rapid change,
ADN said.
   A senior Communist who said he lost faith in the leadership
resigned, and party members at Bergmann-Borsig, a heavy industry
factory in East Berlin, called for Krenz's ouster.
   ``As the chairman of an election commission responsible for
faking election results, Egon Krenz is unacceptable to us,'' they
said in a statement published by the party newspaper Berliner
Zeitung.
   Krenz supervised this summer's municipal elections, which
officially gave the Communists an overwhelming majority. The
opposition says the balloting was rigged.
   Hans-Joachim Willerding, a secretary of the influential Central
Committee and a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, said he
was resigning because he did not believe the current leadership
could gain the stature needed to lead the drive for democratic
change and economic recovery.
   ``Renewal is possible only when the Communist Party leads with
unity and determination and with full authority,'' the official
news agency ADA quoted Willerding as saying.
   His resignation followed a tumultuous parliamentary session
Friday, when lawmakers disclosed that top party officials had taken
bribes, lived in luxury at state expense and stashed away more than
$54 billion in Swiss bank accounts.
   Willerding said the party was in danger of collapse and called
for swift action against those guilty of corruption.
   He was named the Central Committee's secretary in charge of
foreign relations less than a month ago, after Honecker's
government was forced to resign.
   In another report of alleged corruption, ADN said Saturday that
a secret East German operation has been shipping weapons to the
Middle East, Africa and South America. The report said people in
the town of Kavelstorf, near Rostock, complained that ``thousands
of cases of munitions, weapons, and other military technology,''
are stored in a large metal-sided warehouse near homes in the town.
   ADN identified the East German operation as IMES GmbH and its
manager as Erhardt Wickert. It said IMES GmbH came under the
supervision of East Germany's Commercial Coordination department in
the Ministry of Foreign trade, headed by Alexander
Schlack-Golodkowski.
   Foreign exchange proceeds obtained through the weapons deals
were paid into the Foreign Trade Bank of East Germany addressed to
Golodkowski, ADN said.
   ADN also reported that two high-ranking party officials had been
arrested on suspicion of ``fraudulently damaging socialist
property.'' They were identified as Hans Albrecht, a Central
Committee member and former party chief in the region of Suhl, and
Walter Wolf, director of a large home construction company in Suhl.
ADN did not give details.
   On Friday, the country's Parliament stripped the Communists of
their constitutionally guaranteed leading role in the society,
abolishing their 40-year monopoly on power and clearing the way for
further democratic reform.
   The party leadership scheduled an emergency session of the
163-member policy-making Central Committee for Sunday that could
show how much support Krenz has going into a key party congress
Dec. 15-17.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow, in an interview released Saturday
by the West German news magazine Der Spiegel, said the Communists
could win no more than 20 percent of the vote if elections were
held now.
   Elsewhere in the East bloc Saturday:
   _Czechoslovakia's army began dismantling the Communist Party's
paramilitary force, which was last used in January to help riot
police smash a series of demonstrations. Dissident Vaclav Havel
urged the new government being formed this weekend to implement
democratic changes immediately or face more opposition.
   _Bulgaria condemned the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of
Czechoslovakia that crushed a reform movement under way there. It
became the fifth and final participant in the invasion to denounce
it.

   A fisherman found the 5-pound bronze spectacles
snatched from a statue of the late U.S. Rep. Claude Pepper in a
downtown park.
   George Valdes, who was fishing near Jose Marti Park, found the
glasses broken in two and turned them in to police Friday.
   Valdes was fishing Thursday on the banks of the Miami River when
he saw two children about 7 years old playing with what looked like
pieces of copper.
   ``They were playing like swords with them and I scolded them:
`That's Senor Pepper's! Give them to me,''' said the 30-year-old
drummer.
   The specs will be screwed in rather than soldered on Pepper's
nose this time around, said sculptor Tony Lopez, who did the
statue. The result of a $60,000 fund-raising effort, the 9-foot
statue was unveiled in October and the glasses were swiped three
weeks later.
   Pepper, D-Fla., died in May at age 88.

   President Bush, at a summit meeting
abbreviated by stormy winds and high seas, presented Mikhail S.
Gorbachev on Saturday with a wide-ranging plan to speed work on
arms control treaties and lower trade barriers to help Moscow's
ailing economy, U.S. officials said.
   The Soviet leader made no immediate response to Bush's
proposals, officials added, although both sides said the first day
of talks went smoothly.
   ``Things went well. They talked about everything: arms, Europe,
philosophical questions,'' Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said
after five hours of discussions.
   Later came the embarrassing announcement that weather had
stranded Bush aboard his ship _ the USS Belknap _ within view of
the luxury liner Maxim Gorky where Gorbachev awaited him for
afternoon talks. The session was scrubbed, along with dinner.
   U.S. officials said Bush recommended that next year's proposed
summit in the United States _ the target date for signing a pact
for deep cuts in long range nuclear weapons _ be held in late June,
and called for speedy work on a treaty to reduce conventional
forces in Europe.
   They added that the trade proposals included granting the
Soviets observer status at a 97-nation international trade
organization, conditioned on loosened Soviet emigration policies.
   Bush also urged Gorbachev to resolve the problems of divided
families in 1990 and gave him a list of names of people that he
recommended should be granted emigration rights, officials said.
   Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bush
complained about the continued delivery of Soviet-made weapons
through third countries to leftist rebels in El Salvador, saying it
was the most destructive element of superpower relations. The U.S.
officials said Gorbachev replied he didn't know how the arms were
getting to the rebels.
   The two leaders were smiling and in high spirits as they began
their session, clasping hands across a long rectangular table that
measured barely a yard across.
   ``It's so narrow that if we don't have enough arguments, we'll
kick each other,'' Gorbachev told Bush.
   If the schedule holds, the two leaders will end their summit
early Sunday afternoon and depart from this storm-tossed
Mediterranean island, with Bush heading for Brussels to brief NATO
allies and Gorbachev flying to Moscow to report to Warsaw Pact
leaders.
   Soviet officials, told that the United States was putting out
its side of the story, said they would wait until Sunday to react
publicly.
   But earlier, senior Soviet officials said Gorbachev wanted the
summit to produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties
on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in
central Europe and chemical weapons.
   Bush recommended that Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze meet next month to
resolve key obstacles to a treaty to slash long-range nuclear
weapons by up to 50 percent, officials said.
   On another arms front, Bush said NATO and the Warsaw Pact should
conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in Europe next year
and sign the agreement at an international summit in Vienna, the
officials added.
   And, Bush said he would be willing to halt production of U.S.
chemical weapons once an international treaty is reach to ban
poison gas.
   On the economic front, Bush promised anew to lift trade
restrictions against the Soviet Union once it enacts legislation to
ease emigration barriers, the officials said.
   If that condition is met, Bush said the United States would
support Soviet participation as an observer at an international
trade forum, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).
   He also called on Gorbachev to join him in recommending Berlin
as the site for the Olympic Games in 2004, officials said, a
gesture that would dramatize the changes taking place in Europe.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, stuck with Bush on the
Belknap, issued a statement from the cruiser saying the president
thought the talks had been ``extremely productive.''
   Gorbachev seemed unperturbed by the foul weather and scrambled
schedule, escorted his wife, Raisa, on a tour of the Maxim Gorky.
The Gorbachevs spent several minutes in a shipboard ballroom and
then poked their heads into the adjacent library.
   Outside, three wind surfers showed off by darting around the bay
while Bush was stranded.
   A printed U.S. statement said Bush opened the morning meeting
with an hour-long presentation, proposing more than a dozen ideas
for economic and political progress in U.S.-Soviet relations.
   It said the talks ranged from the economic situation in Eastern
Europe to arms control and Central America, and added that
Gorbachev spoke at length about perestroika, his program of
economic restructuring, and the goals of his reform program.
   ``The meetings were sparked by a spirit of forward-looking
cooperation during these increasingly charged times,'' said the
White House statement.
   ``They recognized that economic and political challenges were
ahead for Eastern Europe, and vowed to consider the opportunities
presented with sensitivity and firm initiative.''
   ``The first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which
you cannot board in this kind of weather,'' Gorbachev joked to Bush
as he welcomed him aboard.
   ``We will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the (U.S.)
Sixth Fleet,'' the Soviet leader said with a laugh. The Soviets are
serious, however, in pressing the United States to agree to
reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and
to remove nuclear weapons from the Mediterranean zone.
   Bush braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the
Soviet liner, and then ran into trouble when he returned to his
command ship, the cruiser USS Belknap, also anchored about 500
yards from land.
   His launch had to make four passes at the Belknap before he
could board.
   A White House statement later said the obvious: ``The 60 miles
per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening,
but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail.''
   Asked by reporters if they would reach any achievements,
Gorbachev replied, `` da, da (yes, yes).'' On what? he was asked.
``Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning ``a lot of things.''
   Asked the same question, the president echoed Gorbachev.
``Mnogovo,'' he said.
   The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like
room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and
nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck.
   They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on
either side.
   Bush, who had spent the night on the storm-buffeted Belknap,
said he had not been bothered by the rough weather. ``Piece of
cake,'' he said.
   Bush and Gorbachev began with an expanded meeting that included
at least 16 people and then held a one-on-one session, with note
takers, that lasted about 1{ hours. That was followed by a working
lunch, after which Bush returned to the Belknap.

Dive</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A London-bound Pan American World Airways 747
with 133 people aboard lost cabin pressure at 37,000 feet and dived
for several minutes before returning safely to Los Angeles,
officials said.
   The decompression of Flight 120 Friday afternoon began with a
bang and was followed by a cold rush of air and automatic
deployment of oxygen masks, passengers said. No one was injured and
the cause was not immediately known.
   ``We were very scared,'' said Jane Hinckley, a tourist from New
Zealand. ``We went down so fast that we were pressed back flat
against out seats. We could hear the wind rushing and it suddenly
got freezing cold.''
   The pilot, whose name was withheld by the airline, followed
standard emergency procedures by diving to a lower altitude where
the crew and passengers could breathe without oxygen masks.
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the airline were
investigating, said an FAA regional officer who declined to give
his name.
   The airliner left Los Angeles International Airport shortly
after noon Friday and was heading east at an announced cruising
altitude of 37,000 feet when it lost pressure, passengers said.
   ``The scariest thing was that we were dropping for three or four
minutes and they never told us that we were going to level off,''
said Jal Haemel, a member of the U.S. international sailing team on
his way to a competition in the Soviet Union.
   The jumbo jet eventually leveled off and the pilot informed
passengers they would be returning to Los Angeles. Passengers were
offered spots on a later flight Friday night.

<TEXT>
   President Bush appealed to Soviet
leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev during their summit talks Saturday to
halt the flow of Soviet weapons to rebels in El Salvador, but U.S.
officials said the issue was not resolved.
   Gorbachev, according to the officials, said he did not know how
the arms get to the Central American country.
   The United States alleges that the weapons, including Soviet
anti-aircraft launchers, are channeled through the leftist
governments of Cuba and Nicaragua. A plane that crashed last
weekend in El Salvador carried a cache of Soviet weapons, the State
Department charged.
   U.S. officials at the summit, declining to be identified, called
the dispute the biggest stumbling block to a further improvement in
superpower relations.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker last week denounced the
weapons flow as a ``relic of the Cold War.''
   He had taken the issue up in September with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A . Shevardnadze in Jackson Hole, Wyo. The Soviets
promised at that time to stop direct deliveries and to try to stem
the flow, U.S. officials said.
   The Salavadoran rebels are using the arms in their war against a
U.S.-backed, right-wing government.
   The Bush administration, meanwhile, refuses to stop providing
weapons to rebels fighting a Marxist government in Afghanistan. The
State Department has ruled out a tradeoff with Moscow halting
Soviet arms for Salvadoran rebels and U.S. arms to the Afghans.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow, freezing temperatures and winds gusting to more than 50
mph moved down from Minnesota across the Great Lakes Saturday, and
snow also fell over southern New England.
   Winds gusted to 56 mph at Rochester, Minn., during the early
morning, damaging trees and power lines.
   Warnings for heavy snow squalls and gusty winds were posted
through early Sunday for much of Upper Michigan and southwest Lower
Michigan. Advisories for snow and drifting snow were in effect over
eastern Upper Michigan and much of the rest of western Lower
Michigan.
   Sixteen inches of snow covered the ground at Sault Ste. Marie at
noon.
   Heavy snow warnings also were posted for the snow belt of
northwest Wisconsin, where the town of Hurley reported a foot of
new snow and drifts up to 3 feet deep. Gusty winds with
temperatures in the teens were expected to drive wind wind chills
well below zero overnight.
   Snow and snow showers also stretched into northern Illinois,
northern and central Ohio and northwest Pennsylvania, and into
southern New England.
   A heavy snow warning was posted for northwest and north-central
Indiana, where winds up to 30 mph were expected to cause drifting
and drop wind chills to near 10 below zero overnight.
   A winter storm watch also was posted over the central and
eastern lakeshore counties of Ohio, with up to 6 inches of snow and
overnight wind chills of 15 below zero forecast.
   Squalls were expected to drop 10 inches or more of snow along
the lakeshore and in the mountains of northwest Pennsylvania.
   Winter storm watches for 6 or more inches of snow were posted
over portions of eastern and northwest New York state, Vermont, New
Hampshire and Maine. The northern mountains of West Virginia also
were expected to get up to half a foot of snow.
   Snow and winter weather advisories also were posted for much of
Massachusetts and Connecticut.
   An advisory for snow was posted over western Maryland, and an
advisory for wind and cold temperatures was posted for the northern
mountains of North Carolina, with some light snow possible.
   Elsewhere, rain fell across southern Texas and along the coast
of Washington state.
   The cold early Saturday set or tied records in the Northeast and
around Bakersfield, Calif., which tied a record low of 33 degrees
set in 1938.
   Among eight marks in the Northeast, Burlington, Vt., set a new
low with a reading of minus 2 degrees, Providence, R.I., set a new
low with 11 degrees and New York City tied its record low of 17.
   This morning's low in the Lower 48 states was 13 below zero at
Houlton, Maine.
   Temperatures at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 9 degrees at Caribou and
Limestone, Maine, and St. Johnsbury, Vt., to 79 degrees at Bartow,
Fla.

<HEAD>Delay Reported in Start of Search for Lost Commuter Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The search for a commuter plane that
disappeared off Rhode Island last week was delayed at least 20
minutes until somebody at the Westerly airport noticed it was late,
a newspaper reported Saturday.
   Eight people were aboard when the plane presumably crashed into
Block Island Sound while flying the 17 miles from the island to
Westerly on Tuesday. The Coast Guard gave up searching for
survivors Wednesday night after finding debris and two dead dogs
from the plane.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said
investigators had not recovered the plane, but were compiling
various evidence, including records showing the aircraft underwent
extensive repairs for a crack three years ago.
   Officials planned to use sonar Monday to scan the ocean floor
for debris. New England Airlines President William Bendokas told
The Providence Journal-Bulletin the search was delayed because
ticket agents at Westerly did not realize the flight had not
arrived until 7 p.m., when they called him at home and said it was
20 minutes overdue.
   The pilots commonly fuel and unload planes before checking in
with the terminal desk, he said. Bendokas said he called the
Federal Aviation Administration at 7:15 p.m., alhough Robert A.
Ferreira, manager of the FAA center at Quonset Point, said his logs
show the call coming in at 7:35 p.m.
   FAA records from the agency's Oklahoma City office indicate the
airplane underwent repairs for a crack on July 1, 1986. Seventeen
separate steps were taken to fix the hole, said FAA spokeswoman
Linda Whitfield.
   ``The company was doing more maintenance than required by the
manufacturer'' on the 1969 model Britten-Norman Islander, said NTSB
spokesman Alan Pollock in Washington.
   Pollock said an examination of a dog that was accompanying one
of the missing passengers indicated the animal drowned. He would
not speculate whether that meant the airplane broke up when it hit
the water.
   Seas were 5 to 6 feet and water temperatures about 45 degrees,
making survival unlikely for anyone in the water.
   The plane was not tracked on air traffic control radar and there
were no radio calls for help before the crash, NTSB spokesman Ted
Lopatkiewicz said.
   Since older commuter planes normally don't carry the ``black
box'' flight recorders that are on larger commercial airliners, the
NTSB said investigators were piecing together other evidence,
including the pilot's background.
   Pilot John Beck Jr., 46, had flown part-time for the airline for
about six months, Bendokas said. Beck previously flew for the Navy
and for about 10 years with area charter operations, he said.

   Soviet spokesmen expressed
satisfaction Saturday after five hours of talks in which Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and President Bush advocated a quicker timetable for
completion of nuclear and conventional arms treaties next year and
edged toward a chemical arms deal.
   ``Things went well,'' Gorbachev's spokesman Gennady Gerasimov
told reporters who waited in vain aboard the Soviet passenger liner
Maksim Gorky for an afternoon session. Bush was forced to postpone
the meeting and a dinner because gale force winds prevented him
from leaving the USS Belknap, anchored a few hundreds yards
offshore from the Gorky, which was tied ashore.
   ``They talked about everything, arms, Europe, philosophical
questions,'' Gerasimov said of the morning and luncheon talks.
   Bush suggested that the two men meet again in the United States
in the last two weeks of June, said a White House offical who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   And the U.S. president reiterated his commitment, which is
shared by Gorbachev, that they should use the occasion to sign a
treaty to slash superpower strategic nuclear aresenals by 30 to 50
percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece.
   Gorbachev planned to brief his Warsaw Pact allies Monday in
Moscow on the summit, said Soviet officials, but it was unclear
whether problems with the weather here would delay that meeting.
   For the first time, a non-communist _ Polish Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki _ likely will sit around the table with Warsaw
Pact leaders.
   Gorbachev was pressing Bush for greater speed on the strategic
arms treaty, said Vitaly Churkin, a spokesman for Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   Gorbachev also wanted a commitment from Bush to attend a
proposed 35-nation summit of European and North American leaders in
late 1990 to sign a pact, now under negotiation, to remove 30,000
U.S. and 325,000 Soviet troops from Central Europe.
   The White House spokesmen said that Bush had proposed completing
the deal and signing it at a summit of the 23 NATO and Warsaw Pact
alliance members at a summit in Vienna, Austria, last next year.
   Gorbachev also appeared successful in prodding Bush toward an
agreement to curb or eliminate U.S. and Soviet chemical weapons.
Bush proposed at the United Nations in September that the
superpowers cut their chemical arms by 80 percent, but the United
States would continue to produce a new generation of chemical
weapons.
   The bilateral treaty would be intended to build momentum for a
40-nation accord to eliminate chemical weapons over 10 years. Bush
said that the United States would destroy all its chemical arms by
that deadline if all chemical-capable nations did likewise and
signed the accord, but administation officials that American would
retain 2 percent of its stockpiles through the 10th year.
   The White House official said Bush now was willing to drop the
idea of continuing chemical weapons production, and that the United
States would stop making a new generation of chemical weapons as
soon as a multi-lateral agreement to ban such weapons take effect.
   The leaders also agreed to schedule two or three arms control
meetings between between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and
Shevardnadze, the first in the Soviet Union in January and the next
at a multinational meeting in Ottawa in February.
   A Soviet media commentator, Vladimir Posner, said it was
possible that the summit would stretch into late Sunday to cope
with the interruption Saturday, but stressed he was not speaking
for the Kremlin.
   Such a delay might force postponement of the planned meeting in
Moscow of Warsaw Pact leaders, convening amid sweeping changes in
Eastern Europe that the Soviet officials said would require a
restructuring of the Soviet-led military alliance, which was formed
in 1955 in response to the creation of NATO.
   In the past, Gorbachev and other Soviet leaders have met with
the Communist Party leaders of the six Warsaw Pact members, but the
dissolution of the Hungarian party and the creation of a
Solidarity-led government in Poland has complicated the process,
said the officials.
   ``It is now up to the countries to decide who to send to
Moscow,'' said a Soviet official. ``It will be the bosses as
usual.''
   Poland, for example, is likely to send President Wojciech
Jaruzelski, a former Communist Party leader, and Mazowiecki, the
Solidarity official who last August formed the first non-Communist
government in the Soviet Bloc. The communists retain control of the
defense and internal security minstries.
   The reorganization of the alliance, however, will not be settled
Monday.
   ``It's a hot period now. We need to wait until the situation
sorts itself out in these countries,'' said one official.
   ``The future of the blocs must be discussed'' by Bush and
Gorbachev, said the official, who minimized talk of a reunified
Germany along the lines proposed last week by German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.
   ``They should work on the basis of two Germanies for the
foreseeable future,'' said the official. ``That means as long as
you can see.''
   Bush has said he will not negotiate the future of Eastern Europe
with Gorbachev.

   The opposition made strong gains in the
island's first multiparty elections and handed the ruling
Nationalist Party an embarrassing defeat in the hometown of
Taiwan's president, according to election results Sunday.
   Ballot-rigging and noisy protests marred Saturday's election,
the first national vote since the Nationalist Party lifted martial
law in 1987. The Nationalists have been in power since they fled to
Taiwan following their 1949 defeat by the Communists in China's
civil war.
   Thousands of angry opposition supporters surrounded government
office buildings in several cities Saturday, calling for recounts
or demanding results. Protesters broke windows in one city.
   The opposition Democratic Progressive Party claimed ``a great
victory.'' With nearly all districts reporting, the Nationalists
were garnering 55 percent of the popular vote, while the opposition
won about 35 percent. The rest went to independents.
   ``This is a setback for the Nationalists,'' said Ting Tin-yu, a
professor of sociology. ``They should have won 70 percent of the
vote.''
   In 1986 elections, the opposition won 22 percent of the vote
campaigning as independents.
   In the Legislature, the opposition won 21 seats; it previously
held 12. The Nationalists won 72 seats.
   In county and mayoral races, the opposition won six posts, up
from two before the vote. The Nationalists won 14. One seat went to
an independent allied with the opposition.
   An opposition faction that ran on an illegal campaign platform
calling for an end to Taiwan's claim on the Communist mainland also
polled well.
   In a slap in the face to the Nationalists, opposition candidate
You Ching, a 47-year-old legislator, won the executive post in
Taipei county, President Lee Teng-hui's hometown. The president is
a symbol of Nationalist power.
   ``One of the first things I will do is demolish the Nationalist
Party headquarters,'' You told a screaming crowd early Sunday.
``Then you will be able to walk your dogs on the property.''
   Tens of thousands of revelers celebrated You's victory in what
the local press had dubbed ``the war of the century.'' Supporters
set off firecrackers and danced in the streets near You's campaign
headquarters in Panchiao.
   In all, 722 candidates ran in the legislative, mayoral and
county executive races.
   The Nationalists cannot lose power in the election. The 256-seat
Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by elderly
Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late
1940s and frozen in office to support the party's claim to be the
legitimate government of all China.
   Still, the vote is of tremendous importance to this
highly-industrialized island of 20 million, considered an economic
miracle in Asia.
   It is the first nationwide election since 38 years of martial
law ended in 1987 and the first with a legal opposition. It is also
the first to witness relatively open debate on taboo subjects such
as Taiwan independence and official corruption.
   At least 20 of 32 candidates of the opposition New Country
Alliance won seats in a variety of races. One member, the widow of
a dissident who committed suicide to avoid prosecution for his
beliefs, got one of highest vote tallies in the election. Another
woman, whose husband has been jailed on political charges, also won.
   Even those who chose Nationalists had a preference for change.
   Two crusading reformers from the liberal wing of the party
polled the highest in southern and northern Taiwan.
   Reports of vote-buying were widespread. Several voters in Taipei
on Saturday told The Associated Press they had been paid for their
votes. The going rate was $19.
   Earlier Saturday, the Central Election Commission said it was
investigating scores of reports of voter intimidation and ballot
rigging.
   Angry crowds surrounded county government buildings in Nantou,
in central Taiwan, and Tainan, in the south, alleging that the
Nationalist Party had cheated at the polls. In Tainan, a rowdy
crowd smashed windows at the government offices and beat government
officials, the state-run radio said.
   Protests also broke out in Taichung in central Taiwan. But
police said crowds dispersed Sunday.
   The opposition's campaign focused on the local, rather than
legislative, elections.
   ``We cannot control the Legislature, but we can rule the local
governments,'' said Democratic Progressive Party Secretary-General
Chang Chun-hung.
   In Kaohsiung, Hsu Hsiao-dan, a dancer who used nude pictures of
herself as campaign posters, lost. She ran a campaign based on love
and freedom.

   As leaders of the American Medical Association
prepare to meet to set policy on U.S. health-care issues, some
members are questioning how well the group is running itself after
recent revelations about money-losing deals.
   The AMA is coping with a controversy involving an executive's
pension losses in a high-risk stock market fund and a loan to
another executive who defaulted.
   The disclosures have shaken the conservative image of the
Chicago-based AMA, which with 300,000 members is the nation's
largest organization for doctors.
   ``It's a huge embarrassment to us, to the profession and to the
organization,'' said one East Coast doctor and AMA member who spoke
on condition of anonymity. ``We are concerned about our image
because so much of medicine is based on trust.''
   A resolution calling for the AMA's top executive to step aside
during an investigation is expected to go this week to the group's
House of Delegates. The policy-setting body is meeting in Honolulu
Sunday through Wednesday to consider a host of other issues as
well, including patients' rights and funding for AIDS care.
   Last month, four AMA affiliates passed resolutions concerning
revelations that Executive Vice President Dr. James H. Sammons had
approved two money-losing deals for other top association
executives.
   Making the matter even more painful, doctors say, is that
Sammons is widely admired within the association as an eloquent and
effective spokesman and has been credited with saving the AMA from
financial disaster when he took the job in 1974.
   The AMA's Board of Trustees, after receiving a report from the
law firm doing the investigation, issued its own report Saturday
concluding Sammons had ``acted within the scope of his authority.''
   The report, which will go to delegates for ratification this
week, also said the board will restructure its committees and hire
a new outside auditing firm to try to provide the type of
accountability sought in the affiliates' resolutions. The trustees
declined to comment on the report.
   In 1987, Sammons approved a $353,000 reimbursement to Chief
Operating Officer Whalen M. Strobhar for losses he suffered in the
``Black Monday'' stock market crash. Sammons said he ordered the
reimbursement after Strohbar reported that his $1.4 million in
pension funds was moved by mistake from relatively safe
money-market funds to high-risk but potentially more lucrative
investments.
   Two years later, Sammons reversed his decision after AMA
attorneys said the transfer of funds before the Oct. 19, 1987,
market crash was not a mistake but a ``deliberate act.''
   When the deal was reported in a Chicago Sun-Times investigation
in October, Strobhar, 57, resigned and agreed to repay with
interest what he acknowledged was an ``inappropriate''
reimbursement.
   In the second deal, the AMA lost $50,000 on a $267,000 loan
Sammons approved in May 1985 to help another top executive buy a
luxury condominium while he was going through a divorce.
   AMA counsel Kirk Johnson said there was nothing unusual about
the loan to Richard A. Noffke, 42, then deputy executive vice
president in charge of real estate and other financial affairs.
   But Noffke defaulted on the loan, forcing the AMA to foreclose
and costing it $50,000. Several months after the loan, Noffke lost
his $187,500-a-year job in a management reorganization.
   The revelations about Strobhar's stock market loss prompted the
Illinois State Medical Association to call for the investigation of
AMA financial practices, as well as a review of the association's
administrative structure.
   The doctors' societies of Delaware and the District of Columbia
asked for a curtailment of the broad financial discretion of the
chief executive.
   The Washington State Medical Association said Sammons should be
put on administrative leave until the investigation is closed.
   Mark Meister, executive director of the Medical Society of
Delaware, said his group's resolution wasn't meant to express a
lack of confidence in the AMA or Sammons.
   He said the society is urging establishment of a system of
financial accountability and checks and balances so the chief
executive won't be solely responsible for non-budget disbursements
such as those made to Strobhar and Noffke.

   Tien Lui, who helped develop the Play-Doh

   Lui died Thursday in Cincinnati. He was believed to be in his

   Lui came to the United States in 1924 to attend Cornell
University. He earned a doctorate in agricultural biology, then
taught pharmaceutical science and conducted research.
   In 1957, Lui was hired by Rainbow Crafts, Inc., to develop a
soft sculpting substance that would be easy for small children to
use. Working with Joseph McVicker, whose father owned the company,
Lui formulated Play-Doh.
   ``Other people were involved in it. He made it work,'' said Jim
Kipling, an attorney for Kenner Products, which acquired Rainbow
Crafts in 1971.
   Lui, who lived in suburban Reading, continued to work for Kenner
as a part-time consultant until his death.
   He had no survivors.

   A moderate earthquake under the San
Jacinto Mountains jolted an 85-mile stretch of Southern California
on Saturday, but there were no reports of damage or injury,
authorities said.
   The quake hit at 3:16 p.m. and had an estimated strength of 4.3
on the Richter scale, California Institute of Technology spokesman
Hall Daily said in Pasadena. The epicenter was 16 miles southwest
of Palm Springs.
   The National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo.,
estimated the quake's magnited at 4.5 and put its center 15 miles
southwest of Palm Springs, said geophysicist John Minsch of the
U.S. Geological Survey.
   Magnitude estimates from various monitoring points often differ.
   No injuries or damage were reported, said a Palm Springs police
lieutenant who declined to give his name.
   The quake was also felt in Pomona, 70 miles west of Palm Springs
in northeastern Los Angeles County, and in Indio 15 miles east of
the desert resort.
   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable of
widespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable of
tremendous damage. The killer earthquake in the San Francisco Bay
area was put at 7.1.

   An Episcopalian minister and
eight members of his church detained two weeks ago were charged
with helping leftist rebels and transferred to prison, a human
rights group said Saturday.
   Americas Watch, the human rights group, said the nine
Salvadorans who had been in police custody since Nov. 19-20were
transferred to prison to await trial after charges were filed
against them Friday.
   The human rights group, which is based in New York, made the
statement from its office in El Salvador.
   There was sporadic shooting in San Salvador's northern Mejicanos
district early Saturday, but it ended by daylight and military
officials said the capital was quiet. The rebels launched a major
offensive three weeks ago, attacking numerous targets in San
Salvador.
   The military press office said 19 guerrillas and 10 soldiers
were killed in clashes Friday in Mejicanos and the eastern
Soyapango district. More than 1,000 people were reported killed
during the rebels' offensive.
   Business activity was generally normal in San Salvador on
Saturday, and crews were repairing eletrical lines destroyed by the
guerrillas.
   The Rev. Luis Serrano Lorente and eight members of his Episcopal
church, including its lawyer and social programs directors, were
arrested in police raids Nov. 19 and 20.
   They are accused of allowing rebels to hide trucks loaded with
homemade mortars at their church the night before an Oct. 30 attack
on the Defense Ministry.
   Mortar shells were fired from two trucks, killing a gas station
attendant working near the ministry compound and wounding 15 people.
   Sources at Serrano's church told The Associated Press that armed
guerrillas forced their way into the church compound on Oct. 29 and
spent the night there. They said none of the church members was a
participant in the mortar attack.
   The government has accused Salvadoran and foreign workers
involved in church and human-rights organizations of supporting the
rebels.
   President Alfredo Cristiani on Friday referred to the rebels'
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front as a ``minority joined by
internationalists who come here to murder Salvadorans.''
   The 10-year-old civil war has claimed at least 71,000 lives.

   A man accused of helping his wife kill a
couple in order to take their 9-day-old son was acquitted Saturday
on all counts in the Christmas Eve 1987 kidnap-slaying.
   Jurors returned the innocent verdicts after more than three days
of deliberations in the case of Richard Lynch.
   Lynch claimed his wife, Joyce, had duped him into thinking she
was pregnant, and that he was unaware the child he thought was
Richard Lynch III was not their child.
   ``Oh Daddy, it's over,'' the defendant said as he embraced his
father after court was adjourned.
   Joyce Lynch was found guilty in June of killing Joseph and
Beverly Gibson of Hazletteville, snatching their infant son,
Matthew, and trying to pass him off as her own. She was sentenced
to life in prison without possibility of parole.
   At her trial, Mrs. Lynch had argued unsuccessfully that her
husband controlled her by injecting her with overdoses of a strong
painkiller and that she thought the killings were all a dream.
   The victims' parents avoided reporters after Saturday's verdict.
But the Rev. Kenneth Valentine, a spokesman for the families, said
they were shocked by the decision, which he called ``a nightmare.''
   ``It's hard for us to fathom that one person could have done all
that they did _ murdered two people, kidnapped a baby, Christmas
Eve morning at 1:30 or so,'' he said.
   Asked outside the courthouse if he planned to divorce his wife,
Lynch said, ``More than likely.''
   Concerning the Gibsons, he said, ``I feel sorry for what
happened. Ain't nothing I can do to change it.''
   Prosecutors accused the couple of stalking Gibson, 32, and his
wife, 27, for at least a week before gunning then down at the
mobile home on Dec. 24, 1987, and then taking the infant. The
Gibsons' 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son were not hurt.
   When the Lynches were arrested Jan. 7, 1988, they still had
Matthew Gibson, whom they referred to as their son Richard Lynch
III. Police found them by tracing telephone calls from their
Houston, Del., home to the Gibsons' home.

<HEAD>Investigator To Question Subcontractor in San Francisco Crane Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The investigation of a San Francisco crane
collapse that killed five people will explore possible criminal
wrongdoing by a subcontractor for rehiring a crane operator after
he made nearly ``catastrophic'' mistakes, a newspaper reported
Saturday.
   In Oakland, meanwhile, it was reported that the subcontractor
had been cited for safety violations four times in the past four
months.
   Erection Co. executives will be questioned about the work and
medical history of operator Lonnie Boggess, who died in the
accident, Hamilton Fairburn, deputy chief of California's
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, told the Seattle
Post-Intelligencer.
   Any criminal involvement ``would depend on why they rehired him
and what evidence they had at that time to feel assured that he was
OK,'' Fairburn said.
   Newspapers have reported that Boggess said in a sworn statement
last summer in his divorce case that he was upset over a custody
dispute and made job mistakes that nearly caused ``catastrophic
injury to fellow employees.''
   Boggess had tried to commit suicide twice during the past nine
months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric observation twice
since March, according to court documents obtained by McClatchy
Newspapers.
   There also have been published reports that Boggess had a
history of alcohol problems, as well as suggestions that he may
have suffered a heart attack at the time of the accident.
   Boggess didn't report for work between April and October,
according to employees of his union.
   If the firm laid him off because of his mental state, it ``would
have to show how he was able to return to work,'' Fairburn said.
   The cab of the crane made a sudden 180-degree turn Tuesday while
the crane's height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the
construction site of a new high-rise.
   Fairburn said investigators are focusing on human error as the
likely cause of the crane collapse, which showered tons of steel on
the city's busy financial district.
   It takes deliberate action to release the ``dead man's switch,''
which locks the crane in place, Fairburn said. Investigators still
haven't ruled out a mechanical failure, though, he added.
   The cab, along with other parts of the crane, has been taken to
an undisclosed yard where it will be studied by experts.
   Fairburn said he is aware of published reports that Boggess had
a history of alcohol and drug abuse and has asked the coroner to
speed a toxicology report. Coroner's officials have said blood
alcohol test results will be available in about two weeks.
   Tom Hanley of the California OSHA office in Oakland said state
inspectors have cited Erection Co. four times and fined it $1,500
since Aug. 4 for work on a $122 million, 22-story building in that
city, The Tribune reported Saturday.
   The company was cited for not requiring a worker to wear a
safety belt, failing to provide adequate safety platforms for
workers, failing to post safety rules at the site and carrying out
hazardous crane operations by lifting more than one steel beam at a
time. The first citation came after an ironworker fell 35 feet and
was injured while welding at the site.
   Earlier this week, the Department of Labor and Industries in
Washington state, where Erection is based and Boggess lived, said
the subcontractor had been cited 20 times for safety violations in
the past three years, including once for a fatal accident and four
times for accidents involving injuries.
   Washington regulators have fined the company $117,610 since the
beginning of 1987 but Erection is appealing six cases representing
$99,770 of the fines.

   A twin-engine plane crashed Saturday
afternoon while approaching a mountain airport in snow and fog,
killing both people aboard, officials said.
   ``Weather was a factor. It was snow showers and fog,'' said Dave
Wingert, area manager in charge of the Albuquerque Air Route
Traffic Control Center. ``They were conducting an instrument
approach to Sierra Blanca.''
   The names of the victims were not immediately disclosed.
   An instrument flight plan was filed for the Beechcraft King Air

Wingert said.
   The plane crashed in the Capitan Mountains of south-central New
Mexico three miles east of Lincoln and about 20 miles northeast of
the resort community of Ruidoso.
   Rescuers planned to remain on the scene overnight to guard the
plane until Federal Aviation Administration investigators could
arrive Sunday, said Yolanda Mills, a state police dispatcher in
Alamogordo.

<TEXT>
   An affluent accountant whose wife was
strangled last week was ordered to cooperate in the murder
investigation by giving fingernail scrapings, blood and hair
samples to authorities.
   The order Friday by Cabell County Circuit Judge Dan O'Hanlon
came several hours before a land company sued Lyle B. McGinnis Jr.,
42, charging he swindled the company out of more than $5.64 million
since 1980 and set a fire in his office to destroy the evidence.
   Nighbert Land Co. of Maryland, which handles coal leases in
Mingo County, alleged that McGinnis also took $649,000 from a
corporate stock account he established for Nighbert.
   Kathy McGinnis was found dead behind a St. Albans shopping
center Wednesday afternoon, 15 hours after apparently being
strangled at her home in Huntington. Police did not find Lyle
McGinnis until 36 hours later, when he was involved in a single-car
accident in eastern Kentucky.
   McGinnis did not return telephone calls left at his house or at
his parents' home Friday. Cabell County Sheriff Ottie Adkins said
McGinnis has refused to talk to officers on the advice of his
attorney.
   Police visited McGinnis in an Ashland, Ky., hospital after the
accident to question him about his wife's slaying, but allowed him
to be released when he wouldn't answer questions.
   ``His attorney was down there last night, but he didn't want to
make any comment,'' Adkins said Friday.
   The sheriff wouldn't say whether McGinnis was a suspect. State
police and sheriff's officials from West Virginia and Kentucky
pored over McGinnis' car Friday to look for evidence.
   Nighbert's attorney, Michael J. Farrell, said McGinnis purchased
an interest in the land company in 1979 or 1980 and was named its
accountant in early 1980. Beginning that same year, he allegedly
diverted money to himself, his business or a joint account with his
wife, Farrell said.
   In addition, the lawsuit said, McGinnis failed to pay Nighbert's
taxes since 1980, prompting federal officials to seize the
company's assets. Internal Revenue Service agents were to look over
the records Aug. 22, but the documents were lost in an Aug. 20 fire
at McGinnis' office.
   ``McGinnis caused a fire to be set for the purpose of destroying
Nighbert records,'' the lawsuit said.
   The lawsuit seeks the return of $5 million and punitive damages
of $10 million. It also seeks any additional money that might be
found and asks that McGinnis be forced to pay any federal or state
penalties.
   Nighbert fired McGinnis in October, Farrell said.
   Nighbert obtained an injunction prohibiting McGinnis from
disposing of any of his assets, which Farrell said included a jet
and several cars. Court records show McGinnis in June 1986 paid
$495,500 for an elaborate home just east of Huntington and held
other property in the county.
   In the August fire, McGinnis said robbers broke into his office,
tied him to a chair and set a fire. There were signs of a scuffle,
but police did not close the books on that case.

<TEXT>
   This Dallas suburb's city council changed
its mind and agreed to seek a sister city in the Soviet Union even
though many residents made it clear they consider the Cold War far
from over.
   Council members voted 5-2 to endorse a program that will provide
for student, cultural and business exchanges with a Soviet city to
be determined later, according to The Dallas Morning News.
   ``I think the city council should be proud of themselves,'' Bob
Weidman, president of the Plano Soviet Sister City Program Inc.,
said after Friday's vote. ``They came through and in my estimate
did what was right.''
   Nevertheless, most of the more than 40 people who spoke on the
issue before the council vote opposed the plan.
   Ray Williams said he still believes Communists are out to
dominate the world despite the recent liberalization sweeping
across Eastern Europe.
   ``This is part of the most massive propaganda campaign, which we
swallow hook, line and sinker,'' Williams said. ``If Plano becomes
part of this program, we are approving of the Communist government
by adding the city of Plano stamp of approval.''
   Councilman Mike Teague, who opposed the measure, said there has
been ``too much sacrifice and too much loss to just forgive and
forget.''
   ``I'm about as excited as anybody else about the Berlin Wall,
but what's been torn down can be built back up.''
   The council had rejected a similar proposal seven months ago.
Several members who changed their minds said they were influenced
by the National League of Cities meeting last week in Atlanta.
   The preservation of the human spirit was stressed at the
conference, ``and a new spirit needs to be generated,'' Councilman
Mike Meyer said. ``This is a good chance for us to do that.''

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A correspondent for a Spanish-language radio
network who was reporting from El Salvador was last heard from
early last week and a network official said Saturday he feared the
reporter was dead.
   Salvador Valdez had not be in contact with Cadena Radio Centro
since Tuesday, said Barrett Alley, president of the Dallas-based
network that provides programming for 26 affiliates in the United
States.
   ``If a foreign correspondent hasn't filed (a story) in four full
days, then there's a problem,'' Alley said.
   The 44-year-old reporter was staying at a hotel in San Salvador,
but had checked out early Tuesday after interviewing top government
officials, including President Alfredo Cristiani.
   Alley said Valdez called in seven stories and was not heard from
again.
   ``We believe his last call may have been from somewhere other
than the hotel,'' said Alley, who was in Los Angeles for business.
   The news agency has contacted the Embassy of El Salvador in
Washington, and the press officer at the U.S. Embassy in El
Salvador, but have yet to get any responses, said Alley.
   Officials with the Embassy of El Salvador were not available for
comment. Calls to the embassy were not answered.
   Valdez left for the war-torn Central American country Nov. 25
after leftist rebels mounted an offensive in the nation's capital
of San Salvador.
   More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict between
leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-supported government, the majority
of them civilians.
   Gilberto Cortez, news director for the agency, said in a
telephone interview from Dallas he is trying to stay positive about
his colleague's condition.
   Valdez had not registered with the U.S. Embassy there or with
military authorities, a standard procedure for journalists in
foreign countries.
   ``He had orders to register and he had all the proper press
credentials,'' Cortez said. ``What I believe is that maybe he got
involved too deep with the information he is sending us.''
   Cortez said Valdez is the operations manager for the agency, but
was sent to cover reaction of the uprising because the agency was
short-staffed and Valdez has extensive experience as a reporter.
   Valdez had interviewed a number of government officials,
including defense and health ministers, over four days, Cortez said.
   Valdez was born in Mexico, and is a U.S. citizen whose home is
in Dallas. He has worked for the radio network since its inception
3{ years ago.
   Cadena Radio Centro provides 18 Spanish newscasts a day to
affiliates across the country, including radio stations in
California, Texas, New York and Chicago. The network also provides
music programming and sports information.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The bosom-baring models at Yves Saint Laurent and
the very proper late Duchess of Windsor had one thing in common _
perfectly coiffed tresses cared for by Alexandre de Paris.
   His hairstyles add zing to styles shown at nearly every major
fashion show in town _ from Saint Laurent to Chanel and from
Jean-Louis Scherrer to Emanuel Ungaro.
   During the shows, Alexandre and 20 assistants turn out
everything from ``snail'' chignons to lion locks on hundreds of
models.
   ``I have to know what's going on in the designers' minds,'' said
Alexandre during an interview in his office above the salon on the
Champs Elysees. ``I can't just play the matador with hair. It has
to be a logical part of fashion.''
   Known as king of coiffeurs, Alexandre also performs at royal
marriages such as Princess Caroline's first big wedding in Monaco.
He is on constant call for friends like Elizabeth Taylor and Sophia
Loren.
   He admires Loren ``who actually does her own hair almost every
day.''
   Born Louis Alexandre Raimondi to a family of vintners in the
Riviera seaport of St. Tropez, Alexandre started cutting hair in
1938 when he was 15, working for Antoine, the Cannes hairdresser
who was known as Coco Chanel's favorite.
   Alexandre was encouraged by the bushy-haired writer Colette, a
neighbor and friend of his grandmother ``who talked about Paris all
the time. I knew I had to go there.''
   After World War II, he met the Begum and the Duchess of Windsor,
who insisted he come to Paris, and he transferred his salon.
   Alexandre kept Jean Cocteau's wavy gray locks in line. The
artist-writer-film creator called Alexandre the sphinx, which
became the hair stylist's logo.
   When he met the Carita sisters the trio decided to set up shop
in 1952 on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honore, not far from the
presidential Elysees Palace.
   Five years later, he branched off and hired a staff of 150,
becoming ``Alexandre de Paris.'' In 1980, he moved to the present
salon.
   With outlets throughout the United States and his own salon in
Houston, Alexandre's turnover is about $7 million a year _ much of
it from his accessory and cosmetics business.
   In November, he opened a small luxury accessory shop on the rue
du Faubourg Saint Honore with Francois Lesage, the master
embroiderer of haute couture.
   The whirlwind of fashion shows, royal weddings and openings are
all taken in stride, but some events are more memorable _ such as a
wedding in 1951 in Venice where he made a real splash.
   ``I'd done Princess Ira von Furstenburg's hair for her wedding
and was walking the gangplank from the gondola to attend the
ceremony.'' he recalled. ``Suddenly, I tripped and fell in the
Venice canal like a piece of lead.''
   Alexandre spends much of his free time with his two children
(neither in the hair business) and five grandchildren, often
spending holidays with them at his villa in St. Tropez.
   But his obsession remains with tresses, and he loves to give
advice: ``Long hair is for young girls or women who can afford to
have their hair done every day.'' he said. ``Most women should wear
something more modern, easier to care for.''
   As for older women letting their hair go gray, Alexandre doesn't
think much of it ``unless the woman has a lovely silvery sheen or a
snowy white color, as my grandmother did.''
   Though Alexandre is coiffeur to the stars, he also finds time
for ordinary customers ``provided they reserve well in advance.''
   A cut and restyling at the salon costs $35 dollars, inexpensive
by Paris standards. The price for styling by the master himself is
higher and is set according to the client.
   ``I've done the job so well on a few that their own husbands
didn't recognize them,'' he said.

   Leftist guerrillas raided an irrigation
project, drowned a worker in a tank of gasoline and tried to
recruit others to join the insurgency, police reported Friday.
   They said 30 rebels armed with guns, dynamite and machetes
attacked a workers camp at Ichucruz, 25 miles south of Ayachuco in
the Andean highlands, Thursday night.
   The guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path group dynamited
vehicles and machinery and ransacked the warehouse, authorities
said. When a watchman resisted they tied his hands behind his back
and threw him into a tank of gasoline, according to police.
   About 80 workers were at the camp of the Rio Cachi project.
Before leaving, the guerrillas urged the workers to join the revolt
and threatened those who remained with the project.
   Godofredo Cordoba, the engineer in charge of the project, said
it is designed to irrigate 37,000 acres of cropland, produce
electricity and provide drinking water.
   He said Thursday's attack was the fifth time Shining Path rebels
have raided the camp. In December 1988 they killed four engineers.
   Police said 200 people were detained in a search for suspects
and army units were dispatched to pursue the rebels.
   The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 near Ayacucho, 235
miles southeast of Lima. The government says more than 17,000
people have been killed in guerrilla-related violence.

<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet, nearing the
end of his 16 years of military rule, said Friday the Chilean
people will soon want the armed forces back in power.
   He departed from a prepared text to comment before a gathering
of 2,500 cheering, pro-government women, ``Within years, not many,
Chileans will be asking for the military regime to return.''
   Pinochet did not elaborate.
   He is scheduled to surrender power March 11 to a civilian
president chosen in the Dec. 14 election. Most opinion polls favor
Patricio Aylwin, candidate of a coalition of 17 centrist and
moderate left-wing parties, to win.
   When Pinochet spoke of stepping down, some women pleaded with
him to stay in office.
   The 73-year-old general and army commander responded: ``Don't
forget that I am a soldier, and since the people asked me to leave,
I'm leaving.''
   Pinochet came to power in a bloody 1973 coup that deposed the
elected government of Marxist President Salvador Allende.
   He had to call this month's election after voters in an October
1988 referendum massively rejected a military proposal to extend
his rule until 1997.
   Pinochet will remain army commander after leaving the
presidency, as allowed by the 1980 constitution written by his
government.
   He said that as commander, ``I'll be watching what happens in
our country, not as a bird of prey, but with a wish of
collaborating.''

   An interim, all-party government headed by
Premier Xenophon Zolotas won a vote of confidence in Parliament
Saturday and a mandate to stabilize the Greek economy.
   With all three major parties supporting his administration,
Zolotas, an 85-year-old economist, received 292 votes in the
300-member Parliament. Five deputies were absent, one voted against
and two abstained in the roll call.
   Marina Dizi, the lone Environmentalist Party deputy, voted
against the government. Two legislators from former Premier Andreas
Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement abstained.
   The conservative, socialist and communist parties, which control
297 seats, agreed last month to form a joint government until new
elections in April. National elections in June and November left no
clear winner.
   Zolotas told Parliament when debate began Wednesday that his
priority will be to tackle government deficits and reduce the
government borrowing rate.
   According to central bank figures, the government will spend
$1.9 billion more than it receives in taxes this year, up from
$1.22 billion in 1988 and $844 million in 1987.
   Zolotas, widely credited with Greece's economic recovery after
World War II, blamed ``oversights of the last 20 years'' for the
economic situation. He promised ``frugality with economic
development.''
   The three parties will have to agree on specific measures, such
as boosting public utility rates and a proposed one-time tax on
personal and company earnings.
   They put aside their differences on Nov.22 and asked Zolotas, an
independent, to head the government.
   Constantine Mitsotakis's conservative New Democracy Party won
the most votes in elections on June 18 and Nov.5, but fell short of
a governing majority.
   Papandreou urged immediate acceptance of Zolotas' measures,
telling Parliament: ``Fiscal developments are serious, but they can
be controlled if quick measures are taken and are successful, and
they will be successful if they are taken quickly.''
   Mitsotakis also called for immediate action. ``If measures are
not taken before the holidays it will be too late,'' he said. ``We
will have a cash flow shortage by the end of December of ... ($1.3
billion) which the Bank of Greece will not be able to make up.''
   Hariloas Florakis, head of the communist-led Coalition of the
Left and Progress, asked the government to protect the standard of
living and wages of the workers, ``so as to allow us to support the
government until the end of its term.''
   The Bank of Greece, the central bank, has said the real income
of salaried workers decreased by 10 percent in the last two years
because of an annual inflation rate now estimated at 15-16 percent.
   All three party leaders told Parliament an unprecedented spirit
of cooperation exists among their organizations.
   The conservatives and communists joined forces this year to
indict Papandreou, then premier, on corruption charges. He is to be
tried by a special court next year.
   Mitsotakis said, ``The cleanup can continue, without anyone
claiming that petty political interests are being served.''

<HEAD>Public Employees Strike To Get Promised Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 7,000 public employees began
a strike Friday after Prime Minister Herbert Blaize said his
government could not keep its promise to deliver about $9.3 million
in back pay.
   The strike call came near the end of the business day. It was
expected to shut down virtually all government offices starting
Monday.
   At a meeting attended by about 1,000 workers, union leaders
criticized Blaize's announcement Thursday night that the government
could not pay the retroactive wage increases covering the last
three years.
   Blaize said the government could not pay the money on Friday as
promised because it had not received funds ``from expected external
sources.'' He did not elaborate but said the money would be paid
within three months.
   The government has had trouble collecting export, property and
other taxes, and revenue shortfalls have forced it to borrow
heavily from banks.
   In 1987, imports were nearly three times the value of exports,
and the trade deficit was about $55 million for this Caribbean
island of 100,000 people.
   Leaders of the Public Workers Union, the Grenada Union of
Teachers and the Technical and Allied Workers Union vowed to
continue the strike until the money is paid. They issued a
statement calling Blaize's action unethical and ``a manifestation
of gross contempt.''
   Participating in the strike are teachers and employees of post
offices, banks, ports, customs, the telephone system, hospitals and
utilities.
   Several private organizations, including the Chamber of
Commerce, released a joint statement expressing their ``grave
concern resulting from this development and its potential impact on
the economy and stability of the country.''
   Most of this island's 7,000 government workers are members of
the three unions that ordered the strike.

   A twin-engine Army cargo plane with
four crew members and a civilian on board crashed into a river
Friday as it approached Patuxent Naval Air Station, Army officials
said. No survivors were found.
   The CASA-212 aircraft plunged into the Patuxent River about 9:20
a.m., said John Ooley, Army spokesman at Fort Belvoir in northern
Virginia.
   A Washington television station quoted an Army spokesman as
saying the pilot was on his landing approach when the right wing
dipped and the plane crashed nose-first into the water.
   The aircraft, which left Davison Army Airfield at Fort Belvoir a
few minutes after 9 a.m., was scheduled to have its on-board radar
detection equipment checked at Patuxent, said Pentagon spokeswoman
Paige Eversole. The procedure is a routine part of the Army's
certification process, she said.
   Ooley said the civilian on the plane worked for Lear Siegler
International Corp., a company based in Stamford, Conn. He was
identified as Ronnie Whitely Jr., 31, of Alamogordo, N.M., by his
father, Whitely Sr. The other four on board were from Fort Belvoir.
   Identities of the other victims were withheld until their
families could be notified, Ooley said.
   Navy divers believed they had spotted one body in the wreckage,
submerged in 45 feet of water, 50 feet offshore, said John Romer,
spokesman at the naval station in St. Mary's County in southern
Maryland.
   Rescue crews worked until dusk and a floating crane was to be
used to lift the wreckage from the water, Romer said.m., Ooley
said. The investigation of the crash will be handled by the
Aviation Safety Board in Alabama, Ooley said.
   The CASA-212 was built in Spain and can be used for troop
transport, maritime patrols, paratrooper operations or
anti-submarine actions, Romer said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department said Friday it was
resuming commercial sale of a key component of nuclear warheads
after concluding that amounts listed as missing hadn't been stolen
after all.
   The material, tritium, has been sold for 25 years in small
amounts for research and for making glow-in-the-dark markings, as
for clock faces, exit signs and airport runway markings in remote
areas.
   It is also used to boost the power of nuclear warheads and the
power thermonuclear weapons.
   Twice this year, the Department suspended commercial shipments
from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee. The first time
followed complaints of customers that they had not received as much
as 40 percent of the material they were billed for; the second
time, in October, followed the loss of a substantial fraction from
a trial shipment designed to test handling procedures.
   The department's announcement late Friday of the resumption of
shipments said: ``Four investigations of the tritium shipping
discrepancies have found no evidence to support the possibility of
theft or diversion ... Among the causes of the discrepancies were
deficiencies in equipment, measurement methods, procedures, records
and management and technical oversight'' as well as the unique
properties of tritium.
   Department spokesman Phil Keif said he was unable to assign a
percentage of the 5 grams listed as missing from commercial
shipments to the reasons given, but ``We think it is explainable''
by those reasons.
   ``We don't think tritium was stolen,'' Keif said.
   Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, notoriously difficult
to confine in piping and containers. Officials said in October they
believed undetected leaks could be one cause of the missing
material.
   The department said it had revised its measurement techniques
and saw no need to revise its handling regulations.
   The nation's tritium production and inventories are secret, but
there have been estimates that only about 4 grams is needed for a
plutonium-powered warhead.

   A state legislator's son who is accused of
killing his mother with a hunting arrow is competent to stand
trial, the youth's attorney said Friday.
   The defendant, Chad Goetsch, 19, appeared in Dodge County
Circuit Court at a brief competency hearing on a charge of
first-degree intentional homicide in the Nov. 8 killing of Carolyn
Goetsch, 51.
   Rep. Robert Goetsch, the husband of the victim and adoptive
father of the defendant, sat in a corner of the last row in the
courtroom. He left without comment at the end of the preceedings.
   Judge Daniel Klossner said he had received competency reports
from doctors at the Mendota Health Institute who examined Chad
Goetsch the last week of November.
   ``It's the defense's position at this time that Mr. Goetsch is
competent,'' said Chad Goetsch's attorney, Willima Retert, in reply
to Klossner's question of whether he could stand trial.
   Klossner set a Dec. 5 date for a hearing on motions regarding
evidence in the case. Chad Goetsch has yet to enter a plea to the
charge, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.
   When he was taken into custody, Chad Goetsch told authorities he
shot his mother accidentally while playing with a hunting bow at
the Goetsch farm house, according to the complaint.
   But Robert Goetsch said Chad shot his wife, then pointed an
arrow at him.
   ``My son was going to kill me,'' the lawmaker said in the
complaint.
   Robert Goetsch said he and his son fought, passing through a
hall and several rooms.
   Chad Goetsch, a freshman at Marquette University, had not lived
at home recently, said Dodge County Sheriff Stephen Fitzgerald.

   Investigators want to know why the ``dead
man's switch'' failed on a crane, letting tons of steel pour down
on a busy street and killing five people, a state official said
Friday.
   ``The brakes on the crane are its dead man's switch,'' said
Hamilton Fairburn, deputy chief of the state Occupational Safety
and Health Administration. ``It takes energy to release brakes.''
   The crane's cab made a sudden 180 degree turn Tuesday as the
crane's height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the
construction site of a new high-rise.
   There have been published reports that the crane's operator, who
was among those killed, had a history of alcohol problems and also
suggestions that he may have suffered a heart attack.
   The crane is being studied by experts, but Fairburn said going
over the wreckage would not be a quick job.
   The crane, capable of lifting 177 tons, had to be perfectly
balanced during the repositioning operation, according to Gordon
Marks, a vice president with Swinerton &amp; Walberg Co., the general
contractor for the project.
   Despite the necessary balancing, both Fairburn and company
officials agreed that repositioning a crane is not considered
dangerous.
   ``No one in our firm has ever seen or heard of an incident where
a crane collapsed while being raised from one position to
another,'' said Ned Gates, the firm's chairman.
   ``Historically, it's a very safe operation,'' said Fairburn.
   Both government and company investigators are trying to find out
why the cab suddenly went out of control.
   ``The crane's dead-man arrangement isn't like it is on a
motorcycle,'' said the investigator. ``There, it's the throttle.
You let go, it shuts off. With brakes that are locked in place, you
have to take deliberate action.''
   He said investigators must find out ``whether it was released by
the operator or if there was some malfunction.''
   Right now, he said, the probe is focusing on human error.
   Fairburn said he is aware of published reports that crane
operator Lonnie Boggess had a history that included alcohol and
drug abuse.
   ``We have expanded our investigation to look into that and have
asked the coroner to speed the toxicology report. The alcohol
concerns me because of the psychological and physiological problems
associated with it,'' he said.
   Coroner's officials have said blood alcohol test results will be
available in about two weeks.
   There also has been speculation that Boggess may have suffered a
heart attack.
   Boggess' sister, Genoa Hefke, said she spoke with a worker who
was on the ground and in radio contact with Boggess before the
accident.
   She said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent
and that Boggess, 45, may have had a heart attack.
   ``All of a sudden he stopped answering, and then it started
rocking back and forth,'' she said.
   But, said Fairburn, a heart attack wouldn't account for the cab
suddenly going out of control.
   ``Even if he had a heart attack and slumped forward, it is
relatively safe because the brakes are locked up. They have guards
on them so you can't slump over them. Again, it would take
deliberate action to release them.''

<HEAD>Committee Approves Measure for Public Vote on Extradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A congressional committee ignored
government appeals Friday and approved a bill to have voters decide
if suspected drug traffickers should be extradited to the United
States for prosecution.
   Telling the committee members not to make themselves
``accomplices of drug traffickers,'' Interior Minister Carlos Lemos
Simmonds said approval of the measure would increase drug-related
violence.
   He also suggested drug traffickers were responsible for the
crash of a Colombian jetliner Monday. All 107 passengers and crew
were killed.
   If adopted by Congress and signed by President Virgilio Barco,
the bill would provide for a referendum to determine if the
extradition of Colombian drug suspects should continue.
   The Barco administration has sent nine suspected traffickers to
the United States since it reinstituted extradition on Aug. 18 as
part of an anti-drug fight following the assassination of a
presidential candidate. Drug traffickers were blamed for the
killing.
   Lemos Simmonds called the proposed bill ``monstrous'' and
``shameful.'' He said a referendum would lead to a national
bloodbath as drug traffickers would step up violence to intimidate
citizens into rejecting extradition.
   ``You are inviting Colombians not to a referendum but to the
slaughterhouse, because (the election) will provoke tremendous
violence, deaths and intimidation,'' he said.
   He also said he feared more drug-linked violence before the
presidential elections in May 1990.
   ``Don't dirty Colombia,'' the minister told the 35-member
committee. ``Don't become the accomplices of drug traffickers.''
   The committee voted 24-11 in favor of attaching the referendum
bill to legislation to amend the constitution. The House of
Representatives is scheduled to vote on the legislation Monday.
   The Senate then will have to ratify the referendum. Lemos
Simmonds said he would ask Barco not to sign the measure.
   Some members of the committee objected to the minister's
suggestion they were pandering to drug traffickers. Several said
the public had a right to decide if extradition should continue
amid a wave of terrorist violence.
   Authorities have blamed drug traffickers for some 200 bombings
that have killed 29 people and injured 238 across Colombia in less
than four months.
   Lemos Simmonds, citing examples of violence by drug traffickers,
spoke of ``planes that don't finish their journeys because they are
blown up.''
   Drug smugglers ``bring down aircraft,'' he added.
   He was referring to the Avianca Airlines Boeing 727 that
exploded minutes after taking off from Bogota's international
airport Monday on its way to the southern city of Cali.
   Lemos Simmonds told Caracol radio later that he based his
statements on claims of responsibility for the jetliner crash by
the Extraditables, a terrorist group linked to the Medellin cocaine
cartel.
   A man saying he represented the group told Caracol it blew up
the plane in retaliation for a police raid on the hideout of Pablo
Escobar, a leader of the Medellin cartel, on Nov. 22.
   Caracol later said it doubted the call's authenticity.
   Government investigators said they have not determined the cause
of the crash but it could have been from an explosive device.

   Nearly 200,000 AIDS cases have been reported
worldwide to the World Health Organization, the U.N. agency said
Friday in a report published to coincide with World AIDS Day.
   The WHO report covers only people diagnosed as having the
disease. The number of notified cases seriously underestimates the
true extent of the problem as many cases, especially in Africa, go
unreported. The WHO report also does not include people infected by
the HIV virus who have not developed the disease itself.
   WHO headquarters in Geneva were draped on Friday with patchwork
quilts bearing names and mementos of AIDS victims, including ``Baby
Jessica,'' as a poignant reminder of the global tragedy.
   WHO said in its AIDS Update that 11,000 new victims of the
deadly disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, were
registered by the end of last month, bringing the total number of
cases to 198,165.
   The United States reported 3,025 of the new cases, raising its
mid-November total to 110,333, about 56 percent of the world total.
The United States has recorded 18,043 new victims so far this year,
according to the WHO report.
   Updated figures from France brought the total of cases there to
8,025, the second highest behind the United States. Brazil has
reported 7,787 cases and Uganda, which has not revised its
statistics since April, 7,375 cases.
   Bermuda, with 122 notified cases, has the highest rate of the
disease, with 49.1 cases per 100,000 people. Another popular
holiday resort, the Bahamas, follows with 38.0 cases per 100,000.
The rate in the United States is 12.0 per 100,000.
   WHO said that Kuwait, the tiny Comoro Islands republic off East
Africa and San Marino in Europe reported their first case of AIDS.
   Jonathan Mann, director of WHO's AIDS program, said that during
the 1980s, full blown cases of AIDS are believed to have numbered
600,000 and of those, some 300,000 were thought to have died. He
said more than 5 million people became infected with the HIV virus.
   ``The World Health Organization predicts that by the year 2000,
6 million AIDS cases may have occurred. If HIV spread accelerates,
especially in Asia, these estimates will be too conservative,'' he
told his audience in Geneva.
   AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact.
Other means include sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or
syringes by drug abusers and transfusions of tainted blood or blood
products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before
birth.
   At a ceremony to mark the second World AIDS day at WHO's
headquarters, its director-general, Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, appointed
Princess Chulabhorn of Thailand as WHO's goodwill ambassador for
the next two years.
   Chulabhorn, who holds a doctorate in organic chemistry, said she
saw as her main task promoting WHO's health objectives among heads
of state throughout the world.
   The daylong event, which focused on young people, included panel
discussions, workshops with local schoolchildren and release of two
new films on AIDS.
   Brightly colored quilts hung on the walls of the WHO building.
   ``Baby Jessica'' was embroidered among pictures of teddy bears
on one large piece of patchwork. A huge patchwork map of Africa
hung in silent tribute to the unknown number of victims on the
continent.

   A minister whose controversial children's
home spurred a law governing such operations is being sued by the
state for not complying with the statute.
   The Rev. Herman Fountain and his Bethel Children's Home are
named in the lawsuit as failing to register the church-operated
boarding home with the state.
   Fountain has contended he answers only to God and doesn't have
to abide by state law. The minister is free on $40,000 bond pending
appeal of a year's prison sentence stemming from a raid in 1988
that led to 72 children being taken into custody following
allegations of abuse at the home.
   The incident spurred the Legislature this year to pass a law
regulating all 24-hour child-care services, including those with a
religious affiliation.
   Fountain, a 40-year-old independent Baptist minister, was found
guilty of assault on a police officer, but was never charged with
any mistreatment or abuse of the children.
   Reached by telephone, the minister declined to comment on the
lawsuit.
   Fountain is accused of failing to turn over information to the
state concerning his boarding home for primarily wayward youths,
located on a 28-acre complex on the outskirts of Lucedale.
   The complaint also alleges that Fountain refused an inspection
by the State Fire Marshal's Office.

<HEAD>ACLU Ponders Legal Action Over Bracelet Labeling of Homosexual Inmates</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BARTOW, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday
decried a county sheriff's policy that forces homosexual jail
inmates to wear pink bracelets.
   ``It reflects homophobia,'' said Jim Green, an ACLU attorney in
West Palm Beach. ``Labeling people's clothing based on a sexual
preference seems an extreme response to a situation that doesn't
warrant it.''
   For at least 15 years, homosexual inmates at the Polk County
Jail have been kept separate from other inmates and labeled with
pink wrist bands. The sheriff says it's for their own safety.
   ``All hell would break loose'' in the prison if homosexuals were
allowed to mix with the general population, said Sheriff Lawrence
W. Crow Jr. ``If this system wasn't needed for their own
protection, I'd change it in a minute.''
   Crow said homosexual inmates are often the targets of ridicule
and beatings, so jailers ask all inmates their sexual preference
when they enter the facility.
   If the inmate says he is homosexual, ``he is given a wrist band
and kept separate from the general population,'' said sheriff's
spokeswoman Lynne Breidenbach. ``If we find out things later and
have probable cause that he's a homosexual, then we put the wrist
band on.''
   Ms. Breidenbach said different colored bands are used to
distinguish inmates for other reasons, such as green for
escape-risk inmates. She said there was no special reason pink was
chosen to distinguish homosexuals.
   ``It's really an off-red,'' she said. ``That's just the color
that was available.''
   The county jail has 1,199 inmates, of which 25 to 35 are wearing
bracelets identifying them as homosexuals, Breidenbach said.
   ACLU attorney Green said he is studying possible civil action to
have the practice stopped as unconstitutional. He cited a case in
Indiana two years ago in which a federal court ruled against
segregation of homosexual inmates.
   Kirk Warren, the sheriff's legal counsel, said Thursday the
practice of labeling inmates is legal and ``in the best interest of
the safety of all the inmates.''
   The sheriff, while not acknowledging complaints from inmates or
the ACLU, said he has been looking into switching the colored bands
to bands that have bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets.
   Waving a scanner over the bracelets would tell staff members
whether inmates have medical problems or are wanted in another
county, according to Crow, who said no immediate plans have been
made to switch to the system.
   While bands with bar codes would be an improvement, they're not
a solution, ACLU officials said.
   Robyn Blumner, executive director for Florida's ACLU, described
the bar codes as ``more palatable than pink tags.'' But she
maintained that sexual orientation shouldn't have anything to do
with inmate classifications.
   ``Predator inmates should be separated from victim inmates, but
sexual preference should have nothing to do with it,'' she said.
   Gays who seek protection from others should be granted it,
Blumner said, but only at their choice _ not the sheriff's.
   Blumner said six lesbian inmates have written to her with
complaints that being ``pink tagged'' has limited their privileges
and brought harsh treatment from corrections officers.
   Crow denies the charges.

<HEAD>Thousands of Bodies Allegedly Buried in Already Occupied Graves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators hope to make a map of two
cemeteries where it is believed thousands of bodies might have been
buried in already occupied graves, a state official said Friday.
   Attorney General Fred Cowan's consumer protection division
launched an investigation of the cemeteries in May after a tip from
a grave-digger that old burial lots were being re-used.
   Investigators have since unearthed old headstones at the Eastern
Cemetery, near downtown, and at Greenwood Cemetery, on the city's
west side, and have speculated that many old graves were not marked
properly, if at all. The cemeteries are thought to contain about
81,000 bodies.
   Both cemeteries probably were full by the turn of the century,
said Phil DiBlasi, a University of Louisville archaeologist.
   The burial grounds are owned by Louisville Crematory and
Cemeteries Inc., founded in 1854. The corporation and three of its
officers were charged with 60 criminal counts, including theft,
corpse abuse and grave desecration.
   Burials in reserved graves have continued at both cemeteries
since the investigation began, Cowan said.
   Investigators ``cannot provide any individual consumer with
specific assurances about their particular family member who may be
buried there,'' Cowan said. ``I'm very sorry to say that, but
that's simply a fact of life.''

   A Soviet official on Friday denied
that the Soviet ambassador here ordered the Nicaraguan and Cuban
governments at a secret meeting in Managua to stop shipping weapons
to leftist rebels in El Salvador.
   The French newspaper Le Monde on Wednesday quoted an
unidentified leader of Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government as
its source.
   According to Le Monde, the man said Soviet Ambassador Valeri
Nikolaenko gave the order after Salvadoran authorities reported
finding two light planes bound from Nicaragua with arms for
Salvadoran rebels.
   ``We have spoken with our ambassador ... and he utterly denies
having made statements in this sense,'' said Igor Rybalkin, of the
international department of the Soviet Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee.
   ``Besides, because of the very principle of our relations with
countries like Cuba, like Nicaragua, this is excluded.''
   President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua has not denied the
Salvadoran accusation.
   Rybalkin said his government was concerned about the situation
in Central America, and the region's conflicts will probably be
discussed at the weekend summit between presidents Bush and Mikhail
S. Gorbachev.
   He said that althouth the agenda was open for the Gorbachev-Bush
summit, ``it's very possible, and I'm even sure, that the Central
American conflict is going to figure'' in their discussions.
   Rybalkin is on a goodwill tour of the region.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured
visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West
Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of
the senators said Friday.
   ``He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified
Germany be neutral,'' Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the American
delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.
   Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to
staying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, the
Indiana Republican said: ``Without any reservations.''
   There is growing discussion in West Germany about German
reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms
underway in East Germany. There has been speculation that West
Germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the
Kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.
   Kohl on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with German
reunification as its ultimate goal. But the Soviets, who suffered
millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have
said the idea of German reunification is ``dangerous and
unrealistic.''
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are to
begin a shipboard summit off Malta on Saturday. The dramatic events
in East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East bloc
are likely to be a main topic of their talks.
   Lugar came to Bonn with eight other members of the U.S. Senate's
arms control observer group. He said the purpose of the trip was to
``visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of these
procedures that are going on.''
   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined the senators for their
75-minute closed-door talks with Kohl. The senators also met with
Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense Minister
Gerhard Stoltenberg during the day.
   Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a
``procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe'' and
that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
   Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, ``There is much to work with
there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the
(NATO) alliance.''

<HEAD>Jurors May Have Reached Decision on Five More Counts, Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jurors who turned in one verdict in the
McMartin preschool molestation case may be withholding five others
for fear of disrupting work on dozens of remaining counts, the
judge said Friday.
   The panelists may be trying to avoid explaining their verdicts
to friends and work colleagues while on a scheduled two-week
vacation that begins Dec. 16, Superior Court Judge William Pounders
said.
   On Tuesday, jurors handed in one sealed verdict, but they may
have reached a decision on five more of the 65 counts against
Raymond Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, Pounders said.
   Buckey, 31, and his mother, 63, are charged with molestation and
conspiracy in connection with the alleged sexual molestation of 11
students at their now-defunct, family-owned school in Manhattan
Beach.
   The 2{-year-old proceeding, the nation's longest criminal trial,
has cost Los Angeles County more than $15 million.
   Meanwhile, the judge said he may not read the sealed verdict by
Dec. 15 as he had previously considered.
   The judge said he is considering sequestering the jury and
waiting until all the verdicts are in before reading them. Earlier,
he had indicated he had tentative plans to read the verdicts
piecemeal.
   Pounders previously had ordered the jurors to return verdicts as
they were reached, calling it ``an insane process'' but a way of
avoiding a potential mistrial if one of the 12 panelists is unable
to continue.
   No alternates are available, and the sealed verdicts become
legal only when the jurors affirm their decisions in court.
   ``The worst possible situation is to have verdicts that are not
legally effective and then lose jurors,'' Pounders said Friday.
   However, the judge said last month he could find no case law to
support his plan to accept sealed verdicts one at a time, and
Buckey's lawyer, Danny Davis, had objected to the procedure.
   Attorneys were to meet with the judge on Monday to discuss when
the verdicts should be read.

<HEAD>Search Called Off for Missing Lobster Boat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Coast Guard on Friday ended the search
for a lobster boat and its five-member crew after 11 days of rescue
efforts spanning thousands of miles of the Atlantic.
   ``It's a very difficult conclusion to reach, but we've come to
the point where our chances of success are about nil,'' Rear
Admiral Richard Rybacki said in a statement.
   Rybacki commands the First Coast Guard District in Boston, the
search operation headquarters where the search was launched after
the 72-foot Heidi Marie of Stonington, Conn., was reported missing
last week.
   Aircraft were dispatched more than 50 times in a hunt that
covered more than 100,000 square miles, Rybacki said.
   High winds and rolling seas on Friday hampered efforts to get
another glimpse of a submerged object rescuers thought might have
been a life raft.
   Missing are Mark Middleton, 33, of Norwich, Conn., the Heidi
Marie's captain; Michael Hare, 22, of Pawcatuck, Conn., Kenneth
Raymond Gould, 20, and Ray Morris III, 19, both of Westerly, R.I.,
and Arthur Banks, 25, of Ashaway, R.I.
   During the 11-day search, five flares were sighted, as well as
the Heidi Marie's emergency radio beacon and other debris. Efforts
to find the flares' origin failed.

   Some politicians go out of their way for
votes, but one Nashville city official is appealing to a
constituency that's out of this world.
   George Darden has been trying to get his fellows on the
Metropolitan Nashville-Davidson County Council to fund construction
of a landing pad where extraterrestrials can bring their ships.
   He got some teasing, but no support when the issue came to a
vote this year.
   At a taping for the Joan Rivers Show on Wednesday, though,
Darden found he was not alone.
   ``There was a woman who spent $29,000 turning her mother's house
into a communications center to talk to UFOs, and a man who spent
$30,000 to build a ship similar to what he's heard people
describe,'' Darden said.
   The program is scheduled to air Dec. 7.
   Darden, who has not seen a UFO himself, told Rivers he has
thought about abandoning the issue since the council overwhelmingly
defeated his bill earlier this year to build a landing pad.
   ``But something keeps pushing me to do it and folks keep calling
me about sitings,'' Darden said.

   Top Communist Party leaders took bribes,
lived opulent lifestyles, went on luxurious vacations and managed
to squirrel away more than $50 billion in Swiss bank accounts, a
government investigator says.
   Shaking their heads in disbelief and disgust, members of East
Germany's Parliament listened to a litany of corruption involving
leaders who rigidly maintained a spartan society for their people
while indulging in excess.
   At a tumultuous session that ran late into Friday night,
Communist Party chief Egon Krenz declared his party's guilt but
sought to separate his new leadership from the aging and disgraced
figures now ousted from power.
   The 52-year-old Krenz boldly took responsibility for the party's
alleged misuse of power in 40 years of uncontested rule.

   Alvin Ailey, the dancer and choreographer of
jazz- and gospel-inspired works both accessible and exhilarating,
was hailed as a ``giant'' of modern dance after his death at age 58.
   Ailey's unique, dynamic style introduced black American music
and traditions into modern dance and helped transform it into a
popular art form. He died Friday after suffering for more than a
year from dyscrasia, a blood disorder.
   Singer Harry Belafonte, who toured with Ailey in 1958 and was
his longtime friend, said Ailey ``was just at the beginning of his
achievements. ... He was just at the threshold of his most
important creative years.''
   Ailey died at 4:55 p.m. at Lenox Hill Hospital, said Meg

disorder that affects the bone marrow and red blood cells, said
Ailey's physician, Dr. Albert Knapp.

   The government dropped its sedition
and racketeering case against three leading militants of the 1970s
after three years and more than $2 million in trial costs.
   U.S. Attorney Wayne Budd said Friday he will not retry the case.
Prosecutors claimed the radicals conspired to overthrow the
government by force through a series of bombings and bank robberies.
   ``Given the amount of effort already expended in the
investigation and prosecution, and the effort that would be needed
for a new trial, I have decided that the best course is not to seek
a retrial,'' he said.
   The federal jury cleared the three of sedition charges with a
partial verdict Monday, then deadlocked on whether alleged bombing
exploits constituted racketeering. A mistrial on the racketeering
charges was declared Wednesday.

   Chinese students are dismayed at President Bush's
veto of a bill to let them remain here after their visas expire,
saying he seems to be exempting China from the human rights
standards held for other Socialist countries.
   But several students expressed faith in Bush's promise that he

means.
   Pei Min Xin, a graduate student in government at Harvard
University and a pro-democracy leader, said Friday that Bush caved
into pressure from China, calling the fierce Chinese government
opposition to the bill a ``bluff.''
   ``People like us have come to this country not only to study but
to learn how democracy operates. We have found that this single
case is rather discouraging,'' Pei said. ``When it comes down to a
choice between human rights and geopolitical interests, the leading
democracy did not hesitate to choose the latter.''

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Evidence of the AIDS epidemic is everywhere
in this city, from the political coalitions formed to battle the
lethal illness to the millions being spent to care for its victims.
   Most residents know of someone who has AIDS. The health care
system is saturated, local officials are pleading for federal funds
and the gay community has rallied as never before.
   San Francisco has the nation's highest per-capita incidence of
AIDS. Authorities expect that by the end of the year more than
24,000 residents will have been infected with the virus. Of 7,416
people reported with full-blown AIDS, 4,827 have died.
   Eight years after AIDS began to cut its deadly swath across San
Francisco, changes are apparent.
   Instead of organizing to get government ``off our backs and out
of our bedrooms,'' gay activists have launched a powerful movement
to make government work for them.
   ``We realized that government did have a role to play in our
lives,'' said Ron Braithwaite, president of the Alice B. Toklas
Lesbian and Gay Democratic Club.
   As gay men and lesbians work together on AIDS, they are forging
an alliance some believe will exert unprecedented influence.
   ``It has made us politically stronger, wiser and better
organized than we have ever been,'' said Jean Harris, an aide to
Board of Supervisors President Harry Britt and chairwoman of the
Gay and Lesbian Caucus of the California Democratic Party.
   The city has become an international model for low-cost,
patient-oriented AIDS care that relies on an enormous base of
volunteers, but the cost of the epidemic is daunting.
   Total AIDS spending this year is estimated at $115 million,
according to mayoral aide Susan Ehrlich. Most of the $80 million
from the private sector will come from private health insurers, the
city will add $7.6 million, and state and federal government will
provide the rest, she said.
   And officials expect an additional $30 million will be needed
when the city formally endorses early care programs for people
without symptoms.
   The city's AIDS Office has 75 employees and a budget this year
of $25 million, including state and federal funds, to coordinate
more than 200 different AIDS organizations and service providers.
When it was established in 1983, the office had one director, a
secretary and $150,000.
   At San Francisco General Hospital, AIDS care will cost between
$15 million and $20 million this year, executive director Phil Sowa
said. The 20 beds designated for AIDS patients are always full and
20 overflow patients are hospitalized in different wards, he said.
   A crisis looms in the city's inability to provide sufficient
post-hospital care at skilled nursing facilities and board-and-care
homes, he said.
   Many speak of the ``talent drain'' as the city loses so many
people in their prime. The impact can be devastating.
   ``Who would've thought I'd be reading the obits at 40? Every
day,'' said Scott Smith, former lover and business partner of
Harvey Milk, the city's first openly gay supervisor, who was slain
in 1978 along with Mayor George Moscone.
   Smith said he can't bear to replace his outdated address book
``and leave out all the names that wouldn't move into the new one.''
   AIDS also has politicized a new generation of activists who
scrutinize anything having to do with the disease.
   Organizations like Stop AIDS Now Or Else have staged
controversial protests like blockading the Golden Gate Bridge and
disrupting the glittery opening night of the opera season to call
attention to demands for faster action on drug testing and
increased financing for AIDS care and research.
   ``I think AIDS is one of the new exciting things to be radical
about,'' said Eric Rofes, executive director of the Shanti Project,
a volunteer-based AIDS agency that serves 1,200 a month.
   In the gay community, AIDS prevention and education remain a top
priority.
   Some credit AIDS with triggering a trend toward long-term,
committed relationships between gay men, while others say the
health crisis simply speeded up a process that began before AIDS.
   ``I believe that without AIDS, the picture would look very
similar in terms of more coupling and more (adopted) children,''
said Rofes.
   Public health experts worry that their greatest challenge in the
gay community now is keeping the ``safe sex'' message alive.
   Researchers have noted a slight increase in the number of gay
men who are engaging in unsafe sex again, despite the high risk.
About half of the gay men in the city are believed to be infected
with HIV.
   Having saturated their own community with prevention
information, gays are forming alliances with other high-risk
groups, including intravenous drug users.
   Fighting AIDS also has united gay men and lesbians.
   Although some doubt the durability of the alliance, Harris
points to Britt's domestic partnership legislation as a byproduct
of the AIDS epidemic and a signal of future struggles.
   The proposal, which was narrowly defeated by city voters in
November, would have recognized unions between unmarried live-in
lovers who register with the city, and would have extended
visitation and bereavement-leave rights to city workers.
   The proposal had strong backing from gays in the age of AIDS who
had been denied hospital access to their dying lovers or were
turned down when requesting time off to attend funerals, Harris
said.
   Large corporations have developed AIDS education programs and
provide referrals for employees seeking counseling or other
services.
   But many small businesses cannot get affordable health coverage,
according to Scott Hauge, president of the Small Business Network
of San Francisco, who said one company with 200 workers faced
across-the-board rate increases of 125 percent after two employees
came down with AIDS.
   ``We've demonstrated that the health care system in this country
is very fragile and a lot of people are slipping through it,'' said
Braithwaite of the Toklas club.
   Signs of the AIDS epidemic are everywhere _ even in the chirp of
personal electronic timers frequently heard in restaurants and
movie theaters in predominantly gay neighborhoods. They're
reminding AIDS patients to take the anti-viral drug AZT.

<HEAD>Muni Bonds in Moscow? Consultant Trying To Point the Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is Moscow ready for muni bonds?
   An American financial consultant is trying to find that out.
Jeffrey A. Sachs has signed an agreement with Soviet officials to
help develop the concept of public bond financing in the Soviet
Union.
   Sachs says his plan is aimed at giving Soviet residents a place
to put their huge savings of rubles and at the same time aid the
rebuilding of the nation's economy.
   Any bond program would have to overcome intense skepticism on
the part of the Soviet people, but Sachs believes it is worth a try.
   ``The whole essence of the program is to put the ruble to
work,'' he said in an interview last week.
   Sachs, 37, runs a consulting firm in New York and used to be
chief of staff for Rep. Thomas J. Downey, a New York Democrat. Last
summer he directed government affairs for the Moscow Peace
Festival, a rock concert.
   He is not to be confused with the Harvard University professor
of the same name who advises Latin American debtor nations and
Poland's Solidarity movement.
   The president of Jeffrey A. Sachs Associates Inc. said he
developed his contacts with Soviet officials while helping set up
the Make a Difference Foundation concert, whose proceeds went to
programs fighting drug and alcohol abuse.
   ``I realized that in the Soviet Union, public finance is a very
logical place to begin developing an investment banking system _
everything is government there,'' he said.
   He said the Soviets were taken with the idea, including ones
from the influential Institute of the U.S.A. and Canada.
   In a letter to Sachs in September, Georgy Arbatov, the
institute's director and a member of the Soviet Parliament, said
the biggest concern was the non-convertibility of the ruble into
hard Western currencies.
   To tailor public finance bonds to Soviet investors _ who may not
be attracted by the prospect of earning more rubles, since there is
little to buy with them _ Sachs proposes that the bonds pay
interest in the form of foreign currency certificates. These
certificates could be spent in the country's hard-currency shops.
   Sachs also suggested to the Soviets that they create a savings
bond program, which would pay interest in rubles rather than hard
currencies. Such an issue would need to address concerns about
inflation and compensate for any devaluations in the ruble, Sachs
said, in order to attract Soviet investors.
   These bonds would leverage the vast amounts of rubles Soviet
citizens have salted away, and be a good use of the country's
scarce hard currency, Sachs said.
   Under the ``protocol of intentions'' Sachs signed last month
Soviet officials, including Arbatov, Sachs agreed to assemble a
group of U.S. economic and investment advisers to help devise a
demonstration project using a bond issue. Possibilities under
consideration include housing, a manufacturing plant and a hospital.
   Sachs said he has had preliminary discussions with several Wall
Street firms, which he declined to identify. He said the protocol
is the first step in a process that is expected to lead to a
joint-venture agreement with the Soviets.
   The protocol, which also was signed by the deputy chairman of
the Commission on Economic Reform of the Soviet Council of
Ministers, states that ``the development of a system of public
finance in the Soviet Union is a critical component of economic
reform.''
   One expert on the Soviet economy was skeptical of Sachs's
proposals.
   ``Bonds have a bad reputation among the Soviet people,'' said
Josef C. Brada, an Arizona State University professor.
   Brada said Soviets were soured on bonds by a Stalin-era bond
program used to help finance the government. ``Everyone had to buy
these bonds. They hated it,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   The bonds were repudiated by Khrushchev, who said the government
would not make payments on them.
   Brada said Soviets also would question any plan to index a
bond's return to inflation or currency changes.
   ``People see that real inflation is much higher than what the
state's index shows,'' he said. ``No one is going to believe that
the indexing is going to be done honestly.''
   Brada believes a better way to improve the Soviet economy would
be to devalue the ruble sharply and make it convertible into
Western currencies.

   Big success has come in small packages for Lewis
Galoob Toys Inc.
   Its tiny vehicles have been zooming off store shelves. Micro
Machines have ridden onto Toy and Hobby World magazine's monthly
lineup of fast sellers all year, consistently finishing in the top
10 places and frequently in the first, second or third slots.
   David Galoob says the company is headed toward being a major
player in the toy business in the 1990s. Analysts are impressed
with its progress so far.
   Galoob provided an early look at next year's toys Friday in a
tour of the company's New York showroom.
   ``Miniature has worked for Galoob and we believe that it can
work again,'' the president and chief executive officer said in an
interview. The company is named for his father, who founded it more
than three decades ago and died in 1971.
   Many of the new toys Galoob will roll out next year continue the
small-size theme that has helped the company stage a strong
comeback from a 1987 industrywide slump. Galoob lost almost $25
million that year but returned to profitability in 1988 by earning
more than $6 million.
   New models of the thimble-sized Micro Machines will be added to
the hundreds already available. Some will have a magnifying lens in
place of a sun roof so children can peer into the teeny interior.
New playsets are being added to the car-wash and service station
already on the market.
   Ultra-small vehicles inside regular-sized Micro Machines will be
brought out in 1990. A motorized train and track set also will be
unveiled.
   The existing collection, which appeals to children's acquisitive
instincts, includes commonplace and fancy cars from diminutive
Rolls Royces to souped-up Dodge Vans. The line also has ambulances,
fire engines, trucks, boats, tanks, planes and trains.
   One 1990 addition to Galoob's miniatures for girls is Secret
Places, a series of dolls in rooms with furniture and appliances
that open to reveal even smaller but virtually identical versions.
New offspring of the successful Bouncin' Baby miniature doll line
will make their debut.
   Galoob started thinking small in 1987 when consumers soured on
high-priced, high-tech toys.
   Keeping prices down _ a package of five Micro Machines can be
bought for under $10 _ proved wise over the past two years when so
much money was being spent on home video games. Children and their
parents haven't had much left over for other toys after buying
Nintendo games.
   ``We were able to live and compete very well with the video game
onslaught,'' Galoob boasts.
   Retail analysts say Galoob is one of the only companies that has
kept coming up with creative products despite the competitive
challenge of video games.
   While industry leaders like Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. turned
to classics like G.I. Joe and Barbie, Galoob has established a new
category of miniature collectibles. In the process, Micro Machines
have whizzed past Mattel's Hot Wheels and Universal Matchbox Group
Ltd.'s matchbox cars to become the most popular collectible vehicle
line in the world.
   The company expects to have $200 million in sales this year, up
from $140 million in 1988. It has managed to do it with less money
to spend on research and development than its larger competitors,
such as No.1 Hasbro, which analysts estimate will have $1.5 billion
in 1989 sales.
   ``It really is a challenge for us to compete with those
gentlemen that have bigger dollars at their disposal,'' Galoob said.
   After previewing next year's toys, analyst Paul Valentine of
Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. said he upgraded his investment opinion on
Galoob to a strong buy from neutral. ``I was very impressed with
what they had,'' Valentine said.
   Besides the miniature items, one of Galoob's 1990 toys is a
stuffed animal with battery-powered, illuminated eyes that small
children can take to bed as a night light. A talking doll that
moves her lips also is waiting in the wings and will sell for about
$60.
   ``We don't mind getting into higher priced, high-tech toys _ we
just don't want to be dependent on them,'' David Galoob said.
   How well Galoob does outside the miniature category could
determine whether it can make the transition to a big-time toy
company.
   Analyst Walter Kirchberger of PaineWebber Group Inc. said the
verdict is still out on whether Galoob has done enough to diversify
and protect itself if Micro Machines fall out of favor. Micro
Machines will account for more than half of Galoob's 1989 business,
which was the case in 1988 as well.
   It will be tougher for Galoob to impress Wall Street next year
because the company will face a much higher tax rate, eroding
after-tax earnings.
   ``For earnings to be up in 1990, sales will have to be up quite
a bit,'' Kirchberger said.
   Through three quarters of this year, Galoob has earned about $14
million, up more than three-fold from a year earlier, while sales
totaled about $170 million, up 80 percent.
   Eighty-five percent of Galoob's manufacturing is done in China.
The company is trying to spread out to other Asian nations and was
planning to rely more on Thailand and Indonesia even before the
June uprising in China, David Galoob said.
   Growth in the next decade will partly come through acquisitions
and Galoob says the company, which is based in South San Francisco,
Calif., has put aside $40 million for the purpose.
   In the meantime, he expressed confidence about business
prospects despite weakness in the economy. ``There are always
children so the toy industry is sort of recession-proof.''

<HEAD>Judge Denies U-Haul Motion in Suit Against Ryder</HEAD>

   A judge on Friday denied Phoenix-based U-Haul
International Inc.'s request to order 2,500 of a competitor's
biggest trucks off the road.
   U-Haul had asked Judge Paul G. Rosenblatt of U.S. District Court
for a preliminary injunction against Ryder System Inc., claiming
that Miami-based Ryder had equipped a fleet of 24-foot rental
trucks with a loading device similar to one U-Haul patented Jan.
30, 1973. The patent expires Jan. 30, 1990.
   The patented device, U-Haul maintained, gives its trucks a
competitive advantage of having lower rear decks, making them
easier for consumers to load and unload.
   Ryder told the judge it would suffer an $8 million loss in the
fourth quarter if it had to remove its trucks from the marketplace.
The trucks were introduced in early 1989.
   Both sides claimed victory Friday.
   ``It was very favorable to the U-Haul patent,'' said Thomas G.
Watkins III, an attorney for U-Haul.
   Watkins said Rosenblatt refused to issue the injunction largely
because the ``damage to Ryder, by having all 2,500 of its
infringing trucks parked, outweighed U-Haul's need for such a short
injunction.''
   ``We are gratified that the court has so far supported Ryder's
position,'' David R. Parker, president of Ryder Truck Rental, said
in a statement.
   Ryder contends it did not infringe on U-Haul's patent.
   The 2,500 trucks, which each cost about $30,000, represent about
8 percent of Ryder's fleet of consumer rental vehicles, Ryder said.
   U-Haul on Aug. 23 filed a patent-infringement suit against
Ryder, and on Sept. 15 filed for the preliminary injunction asking
that the trucks be taken off the road. A trial has yet to be
scheduled in the case, but is expected to go before Rosenblatt
during the first half of 1990.

<HEAD>Securities Industry Group Proposals Ending Barrier With Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

   Wall Street leaders have declared an end
to their lengthy battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds
business, proposing to repeal the law that has governed the
nation's basic banking structure since the Depression.
   Directors of the Securities Industry Association, at the trade
group's annual convention here, on Friday endorsed a proposal for
new legislation to let subsidiaries of banks ``engage in a broad
range of securities and securities-related activities.''
   At the same time, the SIA said its plan would let brokers engage
in consumer banking businesses and join banks in having access to
the Federal Reserve's banking system, including the right to borrow
from the Fed in emergencies.
   The move appears to herald one of the biggest breaks yet in the
gradually crumbling wall separating banking and brokerage
activities, erected by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 amid the
financial crisis that followed the stock market crash four years
earlier.
   The barrier has been weakened chink by chink in recent years,
with the move toward financial deregulation and court decisions
permitting banks to make increasing inroads into what had formerly
been the brokers' turf.
   For example, many banks now participate in new offerings of some
kinds of securities, offer discount stock brokerage and sell shares
in mutual funds.
   Brokers, for their part, have also successfully launched forays
into businesses once considered the domain of the banks.
   In 1977, for example, they began to offer ``central assets
accounts'' that are technically not bank deposits, but come with
such features as check-writing, credit cards and lines of credit.
   The banking industry itself has used such brokerage services as
an argument for dismantling Glass-Steagall and allowing them
greater authority to enter the securities, insurance and real
estate businesses.
   Nevertheless, brokers have until now consistently sought to hold
the Glass-Steagall line, arguing that banks would enjoy several
unfair advantages in any arena of unfettered competition.
   They also say banks, with their federal deposit insurance and
links to the Federal Reserve System, should not be allowed to
expose themselves to risky ventures involving such things as the
sale of stocks.
   SIA officials said that banking groups played no part in
formulating their plan, which was made after a lengthy board
meeting late Friday.
   Hardwick Simmons, of Shearson Lehman Hutton, the outgoing
chairman of the SIA, said the Securities and Exchange Commission,
which regulates Wall Street, had been consulted and indicated that
it ``applauded the initiative.''
   The SIA said it would be holding talks with the next few weeks
with the Bush Administration, Congress and regulators to work out
details of what could amount to one of the most sweeping changes in
basic financial legislation in 56 years.
   One widely discussed possible result of any Glass-Steagall
reform has been mergers between the biggest banks and brokerage
firms.
   SIA did not address such specifics. However, most observers
point out that after any merger banking and brokerage activities
still would have to be conducted by separate subsidiaries of the
same company because brokers are regulated by the SEC while banking
is regulated by a different set of agencies, including the Fed,
Comptroller of the Currency and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   ``We think that anything that leads to vastly increased
financial concentration is not in the broader interests of our
financial system,'' said Ken Guenther, spokesman for the
Independent Bankers Association of America, which represents
thousands of community banks.
   Asked about the late-afternoon development, Citicorp spokesman
John Maloney in New York said executives at the nation's largest
banking company would want to study the full resolution. But he
added, ``It's been a bad month for walls.''
   Outside observers see a variety of possible motives for the
SIA's change of strategy.
   Some believe that influential members of the securities business
felt it was useless and costly to keep fighting pitched battles, a
good many of which were being lost.
   Also, the proposal comes at a time when brokers are confronted
with a barrage of other problems, including high overhead and
shrinking profits from many of their traditional activities.
   When one prominent Wall Street figure, Chairman John Gutfreund
of the investment banking firm Salomon Brothers Inc., spoke to the
convention on Thursday, he declared:
   ``It is time for all the institutions in the financial services
industry to find some common ground.''
   A major mission facing U.S. financial institutions, he said, is
to ``work to design the post-Glass-Steagall world.''
