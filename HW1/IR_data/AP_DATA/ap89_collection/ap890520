<HEAD>Irving Goff, Member of 1930s Lincoln Brigade, Dies at 77</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irving Goff, who fought Spanish fascists as a
guerrilla in the famed Lincoln Brigade of the 1930s and later
became a decorated hero in World War II, has died at age 77 after a
longtime heart condition.
   Goff, who died Wednesday at a Los Angeles convalescent hospital,
will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Washington
sometime next week, said his brother, John Goff. No funeral was
planned.
   The Abraham Lincoln Brigade, young political activists concerned
about spreading fascism in Europe, was immortalized by Ernest
Hemingway in ``For Whom the Bell Tolls.''
   Goff, who grew up on New York's Lower East Side, said he learned
about the Lincoln Brigade in 1936. ``I got a passport and joined up
in New York,'' he said in a 1986 interview.
   He and 200 others, some of them leading American intellectuals,
were soon on an ocean liner bound for the Spanish Civil War.
   Within days of their arrival, during a march across the Pyrenees
mountains from France, Goff and other American volunteers blew up a
train carrying Italian soldiers to the front to fight Goff's fellow
Loyalists.
   Goff fought behind enemy lines, usually with a cache of dynamite
as his primary weapon. He finished the civil war relatively
unscathed, suffering only from a case of scurvy, but half the
3,300-man brigade perished in the struggle.
   During World War II, Goff served with the Army's Office of
Strategic Services, forerunner of the CIA, and fought in Germany,
North Africa and Italy. He was discharged as a captain and awarded
a Legion of Merit.
   Following the war, Goff settled in Los Angeles and became a
salesman for a printing supply firm. He married and had two
children.

   China declared martial law in parts of the
capital Saturday to crack down on hundreds of thousands of people
demonstrating for political reform. The government sent in troops,
but residents blocked army trucks and some soldiers turned back
waving victory signs.
   Martial law began at 10 a.m. (9 p.m. EDT Friday) in eight
districts in the central city, including Tiananmen Square, the
center of the protests. No curfew was imposed, and no date was
given for lifting martial law.
   Shortly after martial law took effect, military helicopters were
seen flying over the 100-acre square.
   (ABC's ``Nightline'' reported that witnesses had seen police
clubbing protesters.)
   The protesters, thousands of them on a hunger strike, have
occupied Tiananmen Square for a week, demanding talks with the
government, a free press and an end to official corruption.
   Three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by buses
deliberately placed across the road by protesters. No troops were
seen in the square, but medical workers were distributing gauze in
case of a tear gas attack.
   Premier Li Peng said the protesters threatened Communist Party
rule and were being manipulated by people who wanted to overthrow
the government.
   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, who opposed a crackdown,
offered to resign but the party had not acted on his offer, sources
said.
   The English-language China Daily still referred to Zhao in
Saturday's edition as party general secretary. A reporter said he
did not know about Zhao's political status but had heard he was
sick.
   It appeared clear, however, that the moderate Zhao had lost out
to the hard-line Li in the government's decision to confront the
protesting students.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li signed the martial law
order to put an end to ``serious turmoil ... (that) destroyed
people's life and social order.''
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong signed six measures forbidding
marches, strikes, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets,
spreading rumors, attacks on leaders and media outlets and ``any
other destructive actions.''
   Chen said soldiers were authorized to take any measures
necessary to maintain order in the city of 10 million.
   In a separate order, he said foreign reporters were forbidden to
``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not conduct
interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at government
offices, schools, factories and mines. ``Any violators will be
stopped according to the law,'' the order said.
   The government ordered the Cable News Network to halt
transmissions, and the network had to end its coverage at about
10:10 p.m. EDT. CBS and ABC also said officials cut off their
transmissions.
   CNN reported that even China Central Television, the state-run
network, had been shut down after the martial-law order was
broadcast.
   It was the first time martial law was declared in Beijing since
Communist China was founded in 1949. Beijing becomes the second
city under martial law. Lhasa, capital of Tibet, has been under
martial law since March after anti-Chinese riots.
   Soldiers began moving into the city from the east and west
before dawn, but thousands of local residents poured into the
streets to surround troop trucks. They parked factory trucks and
buses across key intersections to serve as barriers, lifted lane
dividers across the road and at some places formed human barricades.
   ``We are people and you are people! Why do you have no
feelings?'' one demonstrator shouted at the troopers.
   Military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city, a
rare sight.
   About 15 trucks, each filled with about two dozen soldiers,
turned around and drove back the way they came after about 500
students and supporters surrounded them for several hours in
western Beijing and urged them to leave.
   ``You should think about what you are doing,'' one young man
said earnestly, standing on a truck's rear bumper and looking in
the faces of about a dozen soldiers. No weapons were visible.
   When the trucks turned around, the crowd cheered and some
soldiers smiled, waved and flashed V-for-victory signs.
   More than 200 trucks and 50 vans filled with soldiers still
stood further down the road to the west, blocked by thousands of
protesters. About 10 sat on the east side of the city, but a bus
parked across the road blocked the way.
   President Yang Shangkun said the army's task was to protect
important ministries and key installations.
   Zhao was not visible in the audience as Li and Yang announced
the troop deployment in a nationally televised address. Also not
shown was senior leader Deng Xiaoping, 84, believed to be the main
force behind the crackdown.
   After Li's announcement, some students at Tiananmen Square said
they would resume a week-old hunger strike, which had been called
off late Friday.
   Leaders said 200,000 demonstrators would participate, but many
were seen eating after the announcement.
   Demonstrating students said they would remain passive if
soldiers tried to move them and would continue their sit-in until
the government agrees to a dialogue on reforms.
   About 100,000 people were in the square, and an equal number
filled nearby streets. Women cried, men yelled and loudspeakers
blared. Police sirens wailed throughout the city, and one police
vehicle chased several trucks of banner-waving student supporters.
   Li announced the army's intervention in a speech to military and
civilian officials at the Great Hall of the People, which looks out
on the square.
   ``We must adopt firm and resolute measures to end the turmoil
swiftly, maintain the leadership of the party as well as the
socialist system,'' Li said, speaking in an agitated manner and
occasionally waving his fist. He said Beijing was in a state of
anarchy.
   The student protests, which began in mid-April, have evolved
into a nationwide movement and represent the biggest show of
defiance in China's 40 years of communist rule. They overshadowed
this week's historic visit by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   The students in the square drowned out the broadcast of Peng's
speech by singing the ``Internationale,'' the worldwide socialist
anthem. They also chanted, ``Li Peng, step down!''
   Beijing university students began protesting for democracy on
April 15, after former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang died. He
was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier student
dmonstrations.
   Non-students cheered the initial protests, but relatively few
took part in the marches until the hunger strike began a week ago.
Then, fearful for the students' lives and angered by the
government's refusal to talk to them, people from every walk of
life joined in.
   Soldiers and police marched with the doctors, teachers, factory
workers, schoolchildren and dancing troupes.
   Protests also broke out in more than 20 other cities. The
largest marches outside Beijing were in Shanghai.
   An American witness said about 500,000 students and workers
marched Friday in Shanghai and that more than 500 students were on
a hunger strike there.

   Essex Community College students searching for
a class to fill out their schedule next fall may want to wake up
and smell the coffee.
   G. Stewart Eidel said his Essence of Coffee class ``will give
the students a better feeling for the beverage.''
   Eidel said the high price of coffee _ up to $1 for a cup of
basic coffee, and $2.50 to $3.50 for cappuccino and espresso _ has
forced restaurant owners and restaurant management schools to give
coffee a second look.
   The class, which will focus on coffee roasting, grinding and
brewing, is financed by a grant from the non-profit International
Coffee Organization, which is dedicated to increasing U.S. coffee
consumption.
   ``Coffee has become a big deal recently,'' Eidel said. ``For
one, the consumption of coffee has fallen in the U.S. over the last
10 years.''
   The restaurant industry has responded by emphasizing specialty
blends in an effort to increase demand, Eidel said.
   ``We are seeing the trend to gourmet coffees, yuppie coffees and
flavored coffees such as hazelnut,'' he said. ``Coffee is usually
the last item served with a dinner, so it is the most important
part of the meal.''

   Midwestern gamblers can go to class
before going to the track.
   Officials building a dog-racing track in the western part of the
city are teaching a course, Intro to Parimutuel Wagering, at the
Kansas City, Kan., Community College.
   The class will include instruction on the history of dog racing
and how dogs are trained. Information on how much money to take to
the track, and how to bet will be passed out. Students will be
taught how to read a racing program and about theories for picking
winners.
   No college credit will be given for the course, said school
official Sue Courtney. And just so no one thinks the college has
gone to the dogs, a class in horse racing will be offered next year.

   Unity High School's Class of '89 all
agreed on what color their graduation gowns should be. The all-girl
class of 10 picked pink.
   ``This is a pretty special class,'' Superintendent Basil Duffy
said Friday as he and others at the tiny school prepared for
graduation ceremonies.
   Duffy said the school, which serves the farming communities of
Niagara, Petersburg and Dahlen in northeastern North Dakota, has
never before had either an all-girl or all-boy class.
   Members of the class acknowledge there have been some drawbacks
to life without boy classmates. For one thing, they were unable to
crown a king at the Snow Ball dance this year.
   But as they prepared to graduate, the young women say they'll
miss the camaraderie they've enjoyed and their friends at Unity, a
school of only 34 students in ninth through twelfth grades.
   All 10 plan to further their education, either at trade or
business schools or four-year universities. Three of the 10 are
engaged to be married and a fourth ``is promised.''

<HEAD>CBS Announces Fall Schedule: No `Equalizer,' `Beauty &amp; the Beast'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   CBS is adding three new comedies to its Monday
night lineup and shifting its schedule on every night except Sunday
as it looks to shore up its prime-time schedule after a second
third-place ratings finish.
   The network, which announced its fall schedule Friday, is
dumping ``The Equalizer'' and ``Beauty &amp; the Beast,'' but keeping
critically praised but low-rated ``Tour of Duty.''
   It also is bringing back TV veterans Richard Chamberlain and
Lindsay Wagner in new series. Chamberlain will play a Hawaii doctor
and Wagner a zookeeper.
   NBC announced a basically unchanged prime-time schedule earlier
this week. ABC is scheduled to announce its 1989-90 fall lineup
next week. The new season begins Sept. 18.
   To quiet the expected howls over taking ``Beauty &amp; the Beast''
off the schedule, CBS Entertainment President Kim LeMasters said:
``We are not abandoning the show.''
   He said the network has ordered 12 episodes as ``backup.''
   ``We don't want to rush it on the air, because it needs a little
bit of work, and we want to tend to it, because we consider it a
precious commodity to our schedule,'' LeMasters said.
   The producers were unconvinced, however.
   ``They went out to murder the show,'' said Paul Witt of
Witt-Thomas Productions, which also produces the canceled
``Heartland.''
   ``They did give us a backup order for 12 shows, but that's a
face-saving gesture,'' he said. ``We're not angry yet. We're still
too stunned.''
   ``Beauty &amp; the Beast'' had emerged as the only hit among CBS'
new shows in the 1987-88 season. This season, delayed by the
writers' strike of last summer, it was taken off the air
temporarily and tried in other time periods. Its ratings dropped.
   As for ``The Equalizer,'' LeMasters said, it ``was a very, very
tough call,'' but was dropped because of lackluster ratings. The
crime drama had been on the air for four seasons.
   The Vietnam War drama ``Tour of Duty'' remained for its third
season despite mediocre ratings.
   ``It deserves to be on the schedule,'' said LeMasters. ``It says
a lot about our network and the kind of shows we want to be
associated with.''
   ``Paradise,'' a Western starring Lee Horsley, and ``Murphy
Brown,'' a comedy starring Candice Bergen as a network newswoman,
were the only new shows brought back for a second season.
   CBS is adding three new half-hour comedies to Monday night in an
attempt to bolster ``Murphy Brown,'' ``Designing Women'' and
``Newhart.''
   Other returning series included ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``Jake
and the Fatman'' and ``Wiseguy'' and the durable soaps ``Knots
Landing,'' ``Dallas'' and ``Falcon Crest.'' New dramas were added
to Tuesday night instead of made-for-TV movies.
   All three of the news division's prime-time shows made the cut:
``60 Minutes,'' ``48 Hours'' and ``West 57th,'' the latter to be
``reformatted'' with the additon of anchorwoman Connie Chung.
   ``Rescue: 911,'' a midseason replacement, also returns.
   Gone are midseason replacements ``Live In'' and ``Heartland''
and the long-running ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' whose stars had not wanted
to return for another season.
   The new comedies are: ``Major Dad,'' starring Gerald McRaney
(``Simon &amp; Simon'') as a newlywed and recently retired Marine;
``The People Next Door,'' a fantasy starring Jeffrey Jones as a
cartoonist whose imaginings turn real, co-starring Mary Gross as
his psychologist wife; and ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' from ``Frank's
Place'' creator Hugh Wilson, starring Jon Cryer (``Pretty in
Pink'') as a young, hotshot Hollywood agent.
   The new hourlong shows are: ``Wolf,'' starring Jack Scalia as an
ex-cop working to clear his name; Chamberlain's tentatively titled
``The Hawaiian''; Wagner's ``A Peaceable Kingdom''; ``Top of the
Hill,'' starring William Katt as an idealistic surfer elected to
fill the unexpired term of his ailing congressman father; and
``Snoops,'' starring Tim and Daphne Reid, formerly of ``Frank's
Place,'' as Washington professionals _ he a noted criminologist,
she a protocol officer at the State Department.
   Here is CBS' fall schedule, night by night:
   Monday: ``Major Dad,'' ``The People Next Door,'' ``Murphy
Brown,'' ``The Famous Teddy Z,'' ``Designing Women,'' ``Newhart.''
   Tuesday: ``Rescue: 911,'' ``Wolf,'' ``The Hawaiian.''
   Wednesday: ``A Peaceable Kingdom,'' ``Jake and the Fatman,''
``Wiseguy.''
   Thursday: ``48 Hours,'' ``Top of the Hill,'' ``Knots Landing.''
   Friday: ``Snoops,'' ``Dallas,'' ``Falcon Crest.''
   Saturday: ``Paradise,'' ``Tour of Duty,'' ``West 57th.''
   Sunday: ``60 Minutes,'' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' ``CBS Sunday
Movie.''

   Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of Chinese
political power, originally was built in 1651, in the early Qing
Dynasty. The Communist government quadrupled its size in 1958 to
about 100 acres.
   The square, where tens of thousands of Chinese have demonstrated
for political reforms this month, is almost as large as the
106-acre Washington Monument grounds in Washington, D.C.
   In the middle of the square is the monument to the heroes of the
revolution.
   At the south end are the mausoleum where Mao Tse-tung lies in
state and Qianmen, or ``front gate'' to the Forbidden City, a kind
of pre-gate that in the past was the entrance to the road leading
to the main gate of the palace.
   On the west and east are two massive monuments to socialist
architecture, the Great Hall of the People and the Museum of
Chinese History and the Revolution.
   To the north, across the six-lane Changan Avenue, is the
entrance to the Forbidden City, former palace for China's imperial
family.
   In normal times, Tiananmen is a favorite spot for Chinese _
accustomed to cramped quarters _ to take a leisurely stroll under
wide-open skies. The square is always crowded with tourists from
outside Beijing, families on Sunday outings or young couples.
   It also brings people together in times of turmoil or
celebration. A million people were said to have crammed into the
square on several occasions during the radical leftist 1966-76
Cultural Revolution to hear the words of Chairman Mao.
   Tens of thousands more flocked to the square to mourn the death
of the beloved Premier Chou En-Lai in 1976, and in 1984, 1 million
stood in the square to mark the 35th anniversary of the People's
Republic.

   The Magellan spacecraft heading to Venus
will maneuver Sunday night to slightly alter its course and
increase speed, Jet Propulsion Laboratory officials said.
   Magellan was moving at 59,970 mph relative to the sun Friday.
The maneuver at 7 p.m. PDT Sunday will increase the velocity by
about 6.6 mph.
   Jim Doyle, spokesman at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory which
controls America's unmanned planetary explorations, said Friday
that the correction is the first of two built into the mission's
trajectory.
   The space shuttle Atlantis carried Magellan into Earth orbit May
4 and launched it toward cloudy Venus.
   Magellan's mission is to map up to 90 percent of the Venusian
surface with imaging radar. The spacecraft will go into orbit
around Venus on Aug. 10, 1990. A second trajectory correction will
be performed 17 days before it goes into that orbit.

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts, translated by the official
Xinhua News Agency, from a speech by Premier Li Peng about the
student demonstrations:
   The capital is in a critical situation. The anarchic state is
going from bad to worse, and law and discipline are being violated.
   More and more students and other people were involved in
demonstrations and many colleges and universities had come to a
standstill. Traffic jams took place everywhere, the party and
government offices were affected and public security was
deteriorating.
   Some activities on the agenda of the Sino-Soviet summit that
attracted worldwide attention had to be cancelled, greatly damaging
China's international image and prestige.
   Actually, a handful of persons are using the hunger strikers as
``hostages'' to coerce and force the party and the government to
yield to their political demands. In this regard, they have no iota
of humanism. The party and the government have on one hand taken
every possible measure to treat and rescue the fasting students. On
the other hand, they have held several dialogues with
representatives of the fasting students and have earnestly promised
to continue to listen to their opinions in the future.
   The situation in Beijing is still worsening, and has already
affected many other cities in the country. In places, the number of
demonstrators and protesters is increasing. In some places, there
have occurred many incidents in which people broke into local party
and government organs, along with beating, smashing, looting,
burnings and other undermining activities that seriously violated
the law.
   All these have shown that this will lead to a nationwide turmoil
if no quick action is taken to turn and stabilize the situation.
The nation's reforms and opening to the outside world, and the fate
and future of the People's Republic are facing serious threat.
   The party and government have pointed out time and again that
the students are kind-hearted and they do not want to create
turmoil. Instead, these patriotic students hope to promote
democracy and overcome corruption, and this is in line with the
goals the party and government have strived to achieve.
   Now it has become more and more clear that the very few people
who attempt to create turmoil want to reach their political goals _
negating the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the
socialist system and violating the democratic and legal channels.
They spread rumors and smear and hurt party and government leaders.
They concentrate their attack on Comrade Deng Xiaoping, who has
made great contributions to China's opening to the outside world.
... Their purpose is to overthrow the people's government elected
by the National People's Congress and totally negate the people's
democratic dictatorship.
   Under such circumstances we are forced to take resolute and
decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil.
   I urgently appeal on behalf of the party Central Committee and
the State Council: to those students now on hunger strike in
Tiananmen Square to end the fasting immediately, leave the square,
receive medical treatment and recover their health as soon as
possible _ to students and people in all walks of life to
immediately stop all demonstrations and give no more so-called
support to the fasting students in the interest of humanitarianism.
Whatever the intent, further ``support'' will push the fasting
students to desperation.
   I now call on the whole party, the whole army and the whole
nation to make concerted efforts and act immediately at all posts
so as to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation.
   Comrades, our party is a party in power and our government, a
people's government. To be responsible to our sacred motherland and
to the entire Chinese people, we must adopt firm and resolute
measures to end the turmoil swiftly, maintain the leadership of the
party as well as the socialist system.
   We also hope the people in the capital will fully support the
People's Liberation Army, police and armed police in their efforts
to maintain order in the capital.

<DATELINE>VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>

   The British Columbia
Legislature has been saved from an 11th consecutive summer of
seemingly non-stop bagpipe serenades by a street musician.
   The City Council recently passed a resolution requiring street
performers to move at least two blocks after each three-hour set.
   The action has drawn mixed reviews, with officials who said Fred
Tarasoff's music gets on their nerves applauding the decision and
others saying you cannot get enough of a good thing.
   ``It'll be a great relief to all of us in the front of the
building,'' Finance Minister Mel Couvelier said Thursday.
   But Regional Development Minister Elwood Veitch, who has one of
the closest offices to the piper, is on Tarasoff's side: ``Listen,
I've got Scottish blood coursing through my veins. Even when
bagpipes are played off-chord, if that's possible, I still love
them.''
   Tarasoff, who has a doctorate in zoology, each morning commutes
to a corner a caber toss from the Legislature and plays until late
afternoon, weather permitting.
   A letter from the caucus staff of the New Democratic Party
prompted the council to look at limiting Tarasoff's time. Alderman
Eric Simmons said the complaints arose because the music was
incessant.
   ``I guess it gets a little upsetting,'' he said.
   Victoria New Democrat Robin Blencoe called the bylaw a
reasonable compromise between leaving Tarasoff alone or closing him
down.
   ``As far as I know, tourists like him. I don't think everybody
is against him,'' Blencoe said.
   Tarasoff said he is keeping his options open.
   One NDP caucus staff member who declined to be identified said
if Tarasoff is so good, he should be shared with the rest of the
city: ``He's got a monopoly on the corner and you can't get rid of
him. He's driving me crazy.''

   Actress Elizabeth Taylor was the first
choice of the late Aristotle Onassis, but her love for Richard
Burton could not be overcome. So the Greek shipping magnate chose
Jacqueline Kennedy instead, says an author.
   C. David Heymann, author of ``A Woman Named Jackie,'' said
Onassis' daughter, Christina, told him about her father's desire to
marry Taylor.
   Heymann said Christina Onassis called him shortly before her
sudden death in Buenos Aires last November.
   ``Christina told me her father liked Liz a great deal. After
all, she was a great beauty and he liked the fact she had a
terrific sense of humor,'' Heymann said. ``Christina said if it
hadn't been for Burton, Onassis probably would have married Liz.''
   Christina told Heymann she wasn't sure Onassis ever asked the
movie star to marry him but said, ``knowing my father _ yes.''

   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and
European Commission head Jacques Delors have won the 1989 Prince of
Asturias Prize for International Cooperation.
   Jury Chairman Leopoldo Calvo Sotelo, a former centrist prime
minister, said Friday the men were honored ``for their efforts over
the last few years to promote international cooperation and
eliminate barriers to understanding among nations.''
   The prize is among eight annually awarded by the foundation
named for the heir to the Spanish throne.
   Gorbachev, who became secretary-general of the Soviet Communist
Party four years ago, has won acclaim for his efforts to reduce
East-West tension and reach disarmament agreements.
   Delors, a former French Socialist finance minister, has been a
major force behind plans to create a single European market within
the 12-nation European Economic Community by 1993 and a promoter of
greater cooperation between Western and Eastern Europe.

   Bernard Sanders, the former socialist mayor
of Burlington, Vt., will teach next year at Hamilton College.
   Sanders, 47, has accepted a position as a visiting professor for
the spring 1990 semester at the college in upstate New York, school
spokeswoman Helen Burns said Friday.
   A self-described socialist, he will teach sociology courses
dealing with urban problems and democratic socialism.
   Sanders spent eight years as mayor of Vermont's largest city
before leaving office to run for Vermont's lone seat in the House
of Representatives. Running as an independent, he finished a close
second to Republican Peter Smith.

   Actor Todd Bridges reported suffering knee
and back injuries in a traffic accident while riding in a Sheriff's
Department jail van to a bail hearing on an attempted murder
charge, officials said.
   Bridges faces the charges, along with a second defendant, for a
Feb. 2 shooting in a reputed south-central Los Angeles drug den.
The victim, Kenneth Clay, survived and later identified his
attackers, authorities said.
   The accident involving the van and a flatbed truck occurred
Friday morning at a downtown intersection, said city police
spokesman Don Lawrence. He said he could provide no details about
the accident.
   Bridges, who was the only inmate in the van, complained of knee
and back injuries, Lawrence said. The 23-year-old actor was listed
in stable condition in the jail ward at the County-USC Medical
Center, said Deputy Sean Ruiz.
   No other injuries were reported in the accident, authorities
said.
   Bridges was a co-star in the NBC comedy series, ``Diff'rent
Strokes,'' and appeared in ABC's ``Fish'' as well as various
installments of ``Circus of the Stars.''
   Bridges pleaded innocent to the charge in March and was bound
over for trial in Superior Court. Municipal Judge David Horwitz,
who presided over the preliminary hearing, refused to reduce
Bridges' $2 million bail.

   Brigitte Bardot, the French actress turned animal
rights' crusader, returned to the airwaves as host of a series of
programs exposing abuse of animals.
   The first installment of ``SOS Animaux,'' which was broadcast
Friday, documented the slaughter of elephants in Africa, prized by
poachers for their valuable ivory tusks.
   Miss Bardot, 54, who played the blond seductress in ``And God
Created Woman,'' gave up stardom in 1973.
   Since then, she has lived virtually as a recluse in her Riviera
estate, surrounded by dozens of pets, making public appearances
only to promote animal protection.
   Miss Bardot said she was happy to put her name behind a good
cause.
   ``I don't care about my reputation, but I'm delighted to use my
name because it helps me to do something very important,'' she said
in an interview published in this week's issue of the magazine
Paris-Match. ``I have to, because the massacre of animals has
become an industrial and economic issue.''

<HEAD>USDA Reverses Self on Plan to Cut Back Inspections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A flood of complaints has forced the
government to withdraw a plan to cut back on federal inspections at
plants that turn out hot dogs, chicken soup and other processed
foods using meat and poultry.
   But officials of the Agriculture Department left open the
possibility they would revive the proposal later on, and a meat
industry spokesman said a consensus might be sought.
   Since the proposal was announced in November, there have been
many complaints that it would put greater reliance on the plants
themselves to meet federal inspection standards.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said the proposal would have allowed for
``varying the intensity of inspection at meat and poultry
processing plants according to a plant's ability to consistently
produce safe and wholesome product in a sanitary environment.''
   Crawford said the proposal was withdrawn, at least for the time
being, ``in direct response'' to more than 1,800 comments from the
public since it was announced last fall. Most opposed all or parts
of the proposal. He said the agency will gather additional
information and then determine if a new plan will be drafted.
   The withdrawal applied only to the so-called Improved Processing
Inspection proposal, which affects processed meat and poultry
products. The plan als is known as ``discretionary inspection.''
   A 1986 law authorized overhauling the inspection system and
putting in place a ``risk-based'' program in which processors with
good records would require ``periodic inspection'' rather than the
daily supervision previously required.
   The most troublesome plants would come under tougher review.
   One effect would be to cut in half over time the number of
federal inspectors.
   Another proposal, called the Streamlined Inspection System for
the slaughter of cattle, is still under consideration. A number of
consumer groups have rallied against it, alleging that it would
increase the chance of tainted beef reaching consumers.
   The streamlined cattle inspection program would let federal
inspectors in slaughtering operations concentrate on looking for
abnormalities such as tumors and abscesses while allowing company
employees to check some of the routine tasks to ensure cleanliness.
   One of the streamlining effects would be to have carcasses move
along the inspection line faster, meaning less time for checking on
beef headed for the consumer market.
   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee, had urged the department to withdraw both
the inspection proposals, indicating that Congress would step in if
the department didn't reverse itself.
   Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., who heads a Government Operations
subcommittee in the House, said Friday's announcement reflected the
panel's hearings last month which documented the failings of the
discretionary inspection program and showed that it should be
withdrawn.
   But Weiss said he was concerned that USDA was still proceeding
with a computer-based system to generate inspectors' schedules and
decide how often each plant will be inspected. At the April 11
hearing, he said, USDA acknowledged that the computer system was
seriously flawed.
   Weiss said the decision to retain the flawed computer program
was ``dangerous and shortsighted'' on the part of the department.
   Rich Parker, director of information for the industry-supported
American Meat Institute, said the department ``acted judiciously''
in Friday's announcement to pull back the proposal for inspecting
processors.
   The decision ``opens the door for developing a consensus'' plan
to carry out the 1986 law as Congress intended, and the trade
association will cooperate fully with the department and other
interests to help design an acceptable plan, he said.
   ``Consumers can thank these whistleblowers for winning this
battle,'' said Tom Devine of the Government Accountability Project,
which has helped lead the battle against the Agriculture Department
proposals.
   Elizabeth Hedlund of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy
said she was delighted with the decision, calling the original plan
``very poorly conceived.''

<HEAD>Japan May be on List of Unfair Trading Partners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration says no final
decisions have been made on which countries should be targeted for
possible retaliation because of unfair trading practices, but other
sources say Japan and the European Community are sure to be on the
list.
   Rep. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, said Friday he had learned that the
Economic Policy Council, chaired by Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, was recommending to President Bush that the administration
include Japan on the list for its barriers to the sale of American
wood products.
   The list is expected to be released perhaps as early as Tuesday.
   The New York Times reported Friday that the Japanese would
likely be cited for failing to open their market to the sale of
U.S. supercomputers. The newspaper said that the 12-nation European
Community could possibly be included as well for government
subsidies to Airbus, the government-backed aircraft manufacturer.
   The newspaper said that Brazil and India were also being
considered for including on the list of priority nations because
companies in both countries are allowed to pirate U.S. patents,
copyrights and trademarks.
   Christina McCowan, a spokeswoman for U.S. Trade Representative
Carla Hills, refused to comment on the paper's list of countries
other than to say that the final list of countries and products had
yet to be determined.
   At the White House, deputy presidential spokesman B. Jay Cooper
said that the matter was still ``under interagency review. It has
not gone to the president yet.''
   Under the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988, the administration must
issue by May 28 a list of countries that maintain persistent trade
barriers that impede American sales.
   Those countries would be targeted for intensive negotiations
over the next 18 months with the threat of retaliation against
their exports to the United States if no agreement is reached to
remove the barriers.
   While the list must be submitted to Congress by Ms. Hills, the
decision on what countries and products to include will be made by
Bush.
   The administration has been under heavy congressional pressure
to name Japan to the list because of that country's huge trade
surplus with the United States, which last year totaled $52
billion, 44 percent of the $119.8 billion total U.S. trade deficit.
   The compilation of a priority list of countries was mandated by
the massive rewrite of the country's trade law which Congress
passed last year. The provision, known as Super 301 for the section
containing the requirement, has turned out to be the most
controversial provision in the 1,000-page law.
   It has triggered sharp disagreement even within the
administration with the president's chief economic adviser, Michael
Boskin, warning that vigorous enforcement of the provision ran the
risk of counter-retaliation by other countries which could plunge
the world into a global recession.
   Both South Korea and Taiwan figured prominently in an initial
list of 34 countries with barriers against U.S. products which Ms.
Hills issued three weeks ago. It is from that list that the final
priority list of negotiating targets will be drawn up.
   A congressional source, who spoke on condition his name not be
used, said there was a good likelihood that South Korea and Taiwan
would be kept off the final list because of concessions they have
already made.
   On Thursday, Ms. Hills announced that South Korea had agreed to
a number of market-opening actions which the United States had been
seeking.
   In addition, the trade representative's office announced Friday
that Korea had agreed to open its market to imports of many
agricultural products, ranging from poultry parts to bourbon, in
three stages between July 1989 and January 1991.
   Ms. Hills called the agreement ``a positive first step'' but
said many U.S. products still would be restricted or banned in
Korea. ``I am prepared to take action on these products if Korea's
liberalization process does not continue,'' she said.

<HEAD>Fiscal '89 Deficit Smaller Than Expected, So Far</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The unexpectedly strong income tax payments
pouring into the federal Treasury are prompting analysts to predict
that the government's budget deficit this year may undershoot
official projections.
   The Treasury Department reported Friday that the government
posted a record $41.45 billion budget surplus in April.
   While tax payments always inflate the government's coffers in
April, the bulge was much bigger than expected and three times the
size of the $13.77 billion surplus registered in April 1988.
   For the first seven months of fiscal 1989, which began Oct. 1,
the government ran a $86.98 billion deficit, 17.9 percent smaller
than the $105.84 billion shortfall at the comparable point in the
previous fiscal year.
   If the pace were sustained, the shortfall for all of fiscal 1989
would undershoot both the Bush administration's projection of a
$163.3 billion deficit and the Congressional Budget Office's
estimate of $159 billion. Last year's deficit was $155.1 billion.
   ``It's a very encouraging number,'' Louis Crandall, chief
economist for R.H. Wrightson &amp; Associates in New York, said of the
April surplus. ``What we're seeing suggests that the current tax
structure ... is generating somewhat higher revenues than we
thought ahead of time.''
   Crandall, who now expects the deficit to be between $135 billion
and $140 billion, said government spending also has been smaller
than expected so far this year, adding to his optimism. He said the
good news could carry over into 1990 and help reduce future
deficits.
   Analysts said tax revenues may be running ahead of expectations
because of increased sales of stocks and other assets that resulted
in higher capital gains or because taxpayers shoehorned some of
their income from 1987 into 1988, when the top tax rate was lowered.
   The April surplus, representing the difference between what the
government took in and what it spent last month, was fattened by a
$68.53 billion bonanza in individual income tax receipts, up from
the $53.33 billion collected in April 1988.
   William V. Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. estimated the
fiscal 1989 deficit will be around $150 billion, but he said the
improvement was the result of a ``one-shot phenomenon'' in which
taxpayers shifted income from 1987 to 1988.
   ``We're still experiencing the after-effects of the Tax Reform
Act of 1986,'' Sullivan said. ``I would call it a windfall. It does
not portray a substantial pickup in economic growth.''
   Congress this week completed action on a fiscal 1990 budget
blueprint that would hold the next deficit to $99.7 billion, just
within Gramm-Rudman's $100 million limit for next year.
   The government's largest spending categories last month were the
military, Social Security, other programs in the Department of
Health and Human Services, and interest payments on the national
debt.
   Defense spending in April totaled $20.59 billion and reached
$168.63 billion for the first seven months of the fiscal year,
virtually even with the level of defense spending at the same point
a year earlier.
   Spending on Social Security last month was $17.31 billion and
totaled $128.38 billion so far in fiscal 1989, up 5.8 percent from
a year earlier. Other programs in the Department of Health and
Human Services cost $14.34 billion in April and $97.12 billion so
far this fiscal year, up 4.2 percent from the same point in fiscal
1988.
   Interest payments on the $2.77 trillion national debt totaled
$16.63 billion in April and $133.61 billion so far in the fiscal
year, 11.2 percent ahead of a year earlier.

<HEAD>Despite Controversy, Most Senators Accept Speaking Fees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most members of the U.S. Senate accepted
speaking fees last year from groups interested in legislative
favors, according to financial disclosure statements for 1988.
   Only 10 of the 95 senators who have released their 1988
financial disclosure statements refused honoraria. According to
separate calculations by the Common Cause lobbying group, honoraria
totaled $2.7 million.
   Among those to accept the payments:
   _Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, accepted $6,000 in honoraria from the defense industry.
   _Jake Garn, R-Utah, former chairman and now senior Republican on
the Senate Banking Committee, reported $16,000 in honoraria from
the financial industry.
   _Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., a member of the Senate Finance
Committee, which oversees major health programs, accepted $11,100
in honoraria from that industry. The Smokeless Tobacco Council also
paid him a $2,000 speaking fee.
   _Bennett Johnston, D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, accepted $10,000 for speeches to the
energy industry and a trip to Alaska subsidized by oil, gas and
forestry companies.
   _Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the Senate Banking
Committee, reported receiving $10,000 in just two days from the
financial industry.
   _Thomas Daschle, D-S.D., a member of the agriculture committee,
accepted a weekend trip to the Kentucky Derby from the Brown and
Williamson tobacco company, plus a $2,000 honorarium.
   Senators are allowed to keep honoraria equal to 40 percent of
their regular salaries of $89,500. Many earned much more than that,
but gave the excess to charity to stay under the limit.
   No limits are imposed on book royalties, and Senate Majority
Leader George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, earned $22,500 in royalties
from ``Men of Zeal,'' a book on the Iran-Contra affair that he
wrote with his Maine colleague, Republican Sen. William Cohen.
   Cohen's $25,763 in royalties also included some still coming in
from a novel he wrote with ex-Sen. Gary Hart.
   The disclosure forms confirmed once again that the Senate is
still populated with millionaires, about a third overall.
   A notably wealthy newcomer is Herbert Kohl, D-Wis., who reported
that his Milwaukee Bucks National Basketball Association franchise
lost $95,000 last year.
   The senators only have to report general ranges of assets and
income, but Kohl is among the richest senators. He listed assets of
up to nearly $28 million and liabilities of less than $2 million.
John C. Danforth, R-Mo., whose grandfather founded Ralston Purina,
listed assets of up to $13 million and no liabilities.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., reported he was unable to
determine his assets, which are in a blind trust. His income,
however, was at least $607,686. Similarly, the extensive wealth of
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., is tied up in trusts.
   Mitchell is among the paupers of the Senate, listing assets of
just $5,000 to $15,000. Under the rules, that figure does not
include his home.
   Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Republican leader, was better off. He
listed assets of about $293,000 to $691,000. Dole listed $36,000 in
honoraria, of which he donated $31,750 to charity.
   Dole was among those who reported receiving some interesting
gifts. He accepted a series of lithographs depicting ``the heritage
and history of Armenian life'' and a crystal magnolia for his wife,
Elizabeth, now secretary of Labor.
   Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, received from former heavyweight boxing
champ Muhammad Ali an inscribed championship ring. Hatch reported
he considered the ring ``priceless,'' but the gold content was
worth $6,500 and the gem $1,000.
   Five senators received extensions to file their disclosures
late. They were Malcolm Wallop, R-Wyo.; Steve Symms, R-Idaho;
Conrad Burns, R-Mont.; Bob Graham, D-Fla.; and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   The financial disclosure statements sometimes are only as
accurate as the lawmakers make them.
   The Justice Department on Friday accused Rep. Charles Rose,
D-N.C. in a civil suit of failing to report on his federal
financial disclosure statements $138,694 in loans he obtained over
six years.
   House financial disclosures for 1988 are scheduled for release
on Monday.

<HEAD>NRC Urges Appeals Court to Permit Low-Power Atomic Testing at Seabrook</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators are urging a federal
appeals court to allow the Seabrook, N.H., nuclear power plant to
conduct low-power atomic tests.
   ``Low-power testing should begin at once to ensure that Seabrook
can begin producing electricity as soon as the NRC has found that
it is safe to do so,'' NRC and Justice Department attorneys said in
a brief filed with the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia.
   The 20-page brief was filed late Friday in response to plant
opponents' request for an emergency court order blocking low-power
operations.
   On Thursday, the NRC gave final approval for the low-power
license, but said it would wait seven days before issuing the
permit to give the court time to consider the opponents' appeal.
   NRC General Counsel William C. Parler and other government
attorneys dismissed arguments by Massachusetts Attorney General
James M. Shannon and other Seabrook foes as far-fetched and
``simplistic.''
   Shannon, joined by anti-nuclear groups and the town of Hampton,
N.H., contends that the 1,150-megawatt plant 40 miles north of
Boston will never operate commercially because it will never win
approval of evacuation planning. Therefore, the critics argue,
low-power testing would only make the reactor more expensive to
dismantle down the road and pose a health risk to nearby residents.
   But the government lawyers said it is wrong to assume the plant
will not win a commercial license.
   ``There is no reason to believe that Massachusetts' refusal to
cooperate with Seabrook's emergency planning is an insurmountable
obstacle to the full-power licensing of the plant,'' they wrote.
   Seabrook officials submitted their own evacuation plan for the
six Massachusetts communities near the plant after Gov. Michael S.
Dukakis refused to submit state plans. Dukakis says it is
impossible to safely evacuate the seacoast towns.
   The NRC and Justice Department lawyers rejected the opponents'
contention that low-power testing would cost New England ratepayers
more money. They said a delay could result in an economic loss to
the consumers.
   ``If low-power testing should disclose problems that require
substantial time to remedy _ something not expected, but something
that has happened in the past _ delay in beginning such testing
will result in corresponding needless and expensive delays in
full-power operation,'' they wrote.
   ``The public interest lies in avoiding such needless delays in
utilization of poer plants that have been found safe to operate.''
   There was no indication when the court would rule.
   The commission said regulators could issue the license at any
point after 4 p.m. Thursday in the absence of a court order.
   Seabrook officials said they will begin preparations for
low-power testing immediately after receiving the license and start
the tests 10 days later.

<HEAD>Justice Department Files Suit Against N.C. Congressman over Disclosure
Forms</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. Charles G. Rose III, D-N.C., has become
the first member of Congress to be sued by the Justice Department
under the financial disclosure provisions of the Ethics in
Government Act.
   A civil lawsuit filed Friday in U.S. District Court in
Washington accuses Rose of failing to report on his federal
financial disclosure statements $138,694 in loans he obtained over
six years.
   The department sought $30,000 in civil penalties for the six
alleged violations of the Ethics in Government Act. It also sought
an injunction to bar future violations of the reporting
requirements of the law.
   The lawsuit charged Rose, who is chairman of the House
Agriculture tobacco and peanuts subcommittee, failed to report the
loans from his campaign and financial institutions on the annual
disclosure forms filed from 1980 through 1986, excepting 1983.
   Rose's personal loans were obtained both from financial
institutions and his campaign fund, from which he borrowed $52,995,
according to the complaint.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Amy Brown said Rose is the first
member of Congress to be sued under the financial disclosure
provisions of the Ethics in Government Act.
   In a statement, Rose said the lawsuit was intended to ``force me
to file amendments which the House Ethics Committee has not asked
me to file and to pay a fine for amendments (to disclosure forms) I
have already filed.''
   Rose said House leaders have told him they would support him in
the lawsuit because ``the litigation hinders the continued ability
of the (ethics) committee to serve as the primary enforcer of the
reporting requirements for members of the House.''
   In a Feb. 9 letter to a Justice Department official, House
ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., and ranking
minority member John T. Myers, R-Ind., said they believed their
committee already had taken appropriate action in the case by
permitting Rose to amend his disclosure form to reflect the loans.
   The financial disclosure forms are filed each year by members of
Congress by May 15 to cover the preceding calendar year.
   The law requires members to report liabilities exceeding $10,000
on the disclosure forms and provides for civil penalties up to
$5,000 for each violation.
   The complaint charged that Rose filed incomplete financial
disclosure forms by failing to mention both new loans and those
outstanding from previous years that totaled more than $10,000.
   In March 1988, the House ethics committee rebuked Rose after
concluding he improperly borrowed funds from his campaign and
failed to report the loans on his financial disclosure reports. The
committee said it found ``clear and convincing evidence'' of House
rules violations, and said Rose's behavior was ``deserving of
reproach.''

<DATELINE>DAKAR, Senegal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senegalese government has lifted the
state of emergency and nighttime curfew declared three weeks ago
during a wave of violence against Mauritanians living in Senegal.
   The lifting of the restrictions, announced Friday in a statement
by the Interior Ministry, apparently was linked to the opening of a
three-day summit of francophone countries Wednesday in Dakar.
   A dispute between peasants near the eastern Senegalese town of
Bakel on April 9 boiled into widespread violence with Senegalese
attacking Mauritanians in Senegal and Mauritanians attacking
Senegalese living in Mauritania.
   Two Senegalese died in the April 9 incident. The Senegalese said
the two died from the bullets of Mauritanian border guards. The
Mauritanians say it was a dispute between Peulh tribesmen.
   Whatever the cause, more than 260 people are thought to have
died in the subsequent violence in the two countries. An airlift
was set up to repatriate tens of thousands of Senegalese and
Mauritanians.
   The state of emergency in Senegal prohibited all public
demonstrations and meetings of a political nature.
   A meeting between the interior ministers of Senegal and
Mauritania held in Bamako, Mali, ended late Wednesday with no
apparent progress toward a settlement between the two countries.
   Mauritanian Interior Minister Jibril Ould Abdallahi and his
Senegalese counterpart, Andre Sonko, met in the presence of Malian
President Moussa Traore, who has been trying to mediate the
conflict.
   No statement was issued after the session.

<HEAD>Drug Testing Plan Blocked</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plans to administer drug tests to 30 employees
in the executive office of the president and hundreds of workers in
the General Services Administration have been temporarily blocked
by a federal judge.
   U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer issued a preliminary
injunction Friday against the random, mandatory testing which was
to have begun as early as next week.
   He said the programs may be overly broad and there is little
evidence in the court record of any drug problem among employees
covered by the programs.
   The judge also temporarily enjoined testing of GSA employees
suspected of using drugs. The agency's plan must first be revised
to provide that testing is based on more specific requirements,
``reasonable, articulable and individualized suspicion,'' he said.

   Even before he has been formally approved, the
controversial nominee to head the Bush administration's civil
rights program is working at the Justice Department.
   William Lucas is working as a $284-a-day consultant while
awaiting Senate confirmation as assistant attorney general for
civil rights, the department said Friday.
   Lucas, whose nomination is opposed by some civil rights groups,
is studying the Justice Department's role in training law
enforcement officials to be sensitive about civil-rights issues and
report potential violations, said David Runkel, chief Justice
Department spokesman.
   The consulting agreement, which took effect March 20, is a
common arrangement for Bush administration officials awaiting

<HEAD>Prosecutors Say North Wasn't Convicted on Immunized Testimony</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The evidence used to convict Oliver North was
gathered independently from the former White House aide's immunized
congressional testimony given two years ago, according to
prosecutors.
   The government made the assertion in a federal court filing
urging rejection of North's request for a post-trial hearing on the
issue.
   In his testimony on Capitol Hill, North detailed many of the
activities for which he was later accused of crimes, including the
three felonies for which he was ultimately convicted.
   North's lawyers want the case against him dismissed. They have
said the grand jury that indicted him and the jury that convicted
him might have been tainted by exposure to his immunized testimony.
Prosecutors disputed that in a response filed on Friday.

   President Bush's savings and loan bailout plan
is a ``banana republic'' scheme that will cost taxpayers $30
billion to $50 billion more than a Democratic alternative,
according to some Wall Street experts.
   The extra expense of paying for the bailout through 30-year,
off-budget bonds to preserve the illusion of deficit reduction will
likely be 10 times the $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion the
administration has acknowledged, a special House panel was told
Friday.
   ``This is an incredible price to pay for budgetary window
dressing,'' said Bert Ely, who heads a financial consulting firm in
Alexandria, Va. ``Billions of dollars can be saved if the cleanup
is funded for a few years with short-term borrowings until
long-term rates decline.''
   Comptroller General Charles Bowsher, head of the government's
General Accounting Office, agreed with Ely and representatives of
Wall Street investment houses that Bush's S&amp;L plan will tax the
public tens of billions of dollars in unnecessary interest costs.

   While her husband was flying Navy
planes during World War II, Bonnie Sparks bought a handicraft kit
for a leather purse to help pass lonely hours in their New York
City apartment.
   When Milt Sparks came home, he was intrigued by his wife's
hobby, which he developed a quarter-century later into the business
of making high-quality holsters sought by gun enthusiasts and
police around the world.
   Wiley Clapp, feature editor of Guns and Ammo magazine and owner
of several Milt Sparks Holsters, calls them ``the very, very
best,'' the first choice of many knowledgeable pistol owners.
   ``I'm sure in the days of Stradivarius there were other violin
makers,'' Clapp said. ``But the virtuoso used a Stradivarius.''
   The dirt-road outskirts of this former gold boom town provide a
natural location for Sparks' shop. The town's wooden sidewalks
would make an Old West gunslinger feel at home.
   But Sparks said the Wyatt Earps of yesteryear wouldn't stand a
chance in a modern-day showdown.
   ``I think that any modern pistolero could clean out the OK
Corral before they could get their guns out of their holsters,'' he
said.
   All holsters are not created equal, it seems.
   ``A holster can quite simply be a matter of living or dying,''
said Mike Waidelich, a Bakersfield, Calif., detective. ``When you
use it 40 hours a week, it needs to be very serviceable. It needs
to be right.''
   Three years ago, Waidelich convinced Bakersfield's 235-member
police force to make the Sparks standard equipment although it cost
about 50 percent more than the holsters they were using.
   Before strapping on a Sparks, Waidelich once had his pistol fall
out of his holster while chasing a suspect. Another time he spent
15 minutes coaxing his weapon out of a poorly designed holster, he
said.
   A Sparks holster is crafted to hold the weapon snugly as an
officer runs or climbs over a fence, but relinquish it when it's
needed, Waidelich said.
   Tony Kanaley, Sparks' shop manager, estimates that 60 percent of
the company's business is from police officers. Clients also
include such celebrities as Hank Williams Jr. and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar.
   Sparks starts with a stiff piece of vegetable-tanned cowhide.
Kanaley grades and cuts all the leather, and an individual worker
is responsible for finishing the job.
   Sparks said his motto is: ``Do it right.''
   ``Don't sacrifice your integrity to make money,'' he said. ``If
it's not right, if it doesn't save a man's life in a pinch, then
don't do it.''
   In the beginning, satisfaction in a job well done was Sparks'
sole reward. ``Now, I want to make a little money,'' the
72-year-old Sparks said.
   Recently he has been able to leave many day-to-day duties to
Kanaley and his three-person crew, freeing him to travel,
participate in shooting competitions and promote his products.
   Sparks, a former charter pilot and flight instructor, worked
briefly during the late 1940s for a Boise belt and holster maker,
but did not become serious about his craft until 1971 when a fellow
pilot asked him to make a holster.
   Impressed with the results, the friend convinced him there was a
market for well-made holsters.
   The following year Sparks quit his job as a pilot for the U.S.
Bureau of Reclamation and in 1973 moved to Idaho City.

<TEXT>
   Oil industry officials who testified
during federal hearings into the Exxon Valdez disaster lied under
oath to protect their companies' financial interests, a state
official charges.
   The latest skirmish in the battle of blame over the nation's
largest oil spill came Friday after the fourth day of fact-finding
hearings by a National Transportation Safety Board panel. The
hearings conclude today.
   Alaska's representative at the hearings, Bob LeResche, accused
representatives of Exxon Shipping Co. and Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. of conducting a disinformation campaign to help limit their
liability for the spill's damage.
   ``It's beyond me how officers of a big corporation like this can
just tell things that they flat know are lies, but they're doing it
repeatedly,'' LeResche said in an interview.
   LeResche said he was especially irked by Exxon's suggestion that
the March 24 spill was too large to remove, and that government
officials took their time approving use of chemical dispersants.
   The latter issue arose in litigation over the larger Amoco Cadiz
spill off the French coast in 1978. If Exxon and Alyeska can prove
the government stalled efforts to disperse the oil, it may be able
to escape some of its liability costs, he said.
   ``The dispersant issue is just a phony red herring that Exxon is
floating, and I'm sure as I stand here that their attorneys have
figured out that Amoco got off on just that issue in the French
courts,'' he said. ``It has no relation to the facts in this spill,
but it's the only legal theory that's ever worked for an oil
company, so they're telling lies.''
   William Deppe, Exxon's representative at the hearings, said he
and other Exxon executives had been told not to comment to
reporters.
   Exxon spokesman Joe Tucker in Valdez referred a request for
comment to the corporation's Houston offices, where calls went
unanswered late Friday.
   LeResche also criticized Friday's testimony by Alyeska
officials, who said their contingency plan did not guarantee that a
major spill could be completely cleaned up. For years the industry
promised it could handle a major spill and prevent an environmental
disaster, he said.
   ``Basically what they're saying is, `Yeah, we promised you this
but now we'll tell you we had our fingers crossed when we made that
promise,' '' he said.
   Alyeska, a consortium of oil companies that owns the Alaska
pipeline and Valdez shipping terminal, is responsible for initially
responding to spills in Prince William Sound.
   Company spokesman Tom Brennan denied LeResche's charges.
   ``Our witnesses told the absolute truth on the stand. We stand
behind their testimony,'' Brennan said.
   LeResche, executive director of the Alaska Power Authority, was
named the state's oil-spill coordinator by Gov. Steve Cowper after
the spill. He's a former state commissioner of natural resources.
   Although the overall atmosphere at the hearings has been polite
and non-adversarial, exchanges between state officials and industry
executives have been marked by tension and insinuation.
   A Coast Guard officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said
Friday that state officials were naive or uninformed if they
believed a spill as large as the one in Prince William Sound could
be cleaned up quickly.
   In the day after the tanker ran aground, no amount of boom could
have contained a slick that measured 25 square miles and was up to
a foot thick, he said.
   But LeResche insisted that the industry had changed its tune.
   ``They never said it wasn't reasonable or realistic before,'' he
said. ``They'd been promising everyone in America that it would
work. Now they say, `All along we knew it wouldn't.' I don't get
it.''
   In Friday's testimony, Alyeska managers testified that they did
not know whether the temporary unavailability of 25 tons of cleanup
gear hampered their response to the 10.9 million-gallon spill.

<HEAD>FDA Recalls Mushrooms From China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three separate outbreaks of food poisoning
have led federal authorities to order a recall of
institutional-sized cans of mushrooms from China.
   The 68-oz. cans of mushrooms carry the packer designations
``TM'' in the top line, or ``T3'' or M2'' in the middle line of a
three-line code on the end of the can, the Food and Drug
Administration said.
   The FDA said it is stepping up testing of home-sized cans of
mushrooms from China, but none are being recalled at this point.
   The FDA said it plans to cooperate with Chinese officials to
find the cause of the problem and has offered to send a team of
investigators to that country.
   Outbreaks of staphylococcal food poisoning were reported in a
cafeteria at Mississippi State University on Feb. 13; at the
Peninsula Hospital Center cafeteria in Queens, N.Y.; and a pizza
parlor in Phillipburg, Pa., on April 20.
   FDA said at least 15 people have been hospitalized with the
illness, which causes nausea and vomiting. Several other outbreaks
were reported that may be linked to the mushrooms, the agency said.

   The body of the man authorities say was the
``godfather'' of a cult linked to 15 slayings near the U.S. border
has been transported from Mexico to his hometown of Miami, a police
source said.
   The source, who works in the Mexico City attorney general's
office, said the body of Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo, 26, was
transported Friday on a commercial flight to Miami.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the body
had remained unclaimed at the Mexico City morgue since Constanzo
died May 6, when he reportedly ordered a partner to shoot him when
police closed in.
   Constanzo has been described as the leader of a sect authorities
blame for 15 killings outside the border city of Matamoros. Sect
members have said some slayings were ritual killings while others
were drug-related.
   Constanzo's body was claimed by a U.S. Consulate representative
acting on behalf of Constanzo's mother, Aurora Gonzales del Valle
of Miami, the source said. He said funeral arrangements were
pending in Miami, but did not have specifics.
   The process of transporting the body to the United States was
complicated by the investigation and red tape associated with
transporting a body across international borders, the source said.
He said even though Constanzo's family had made inquiries, they did
not claim the body until this week.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Bill Graves said late Friday that he knew
U.S. officials were working to return Constanzo's body to his
family but had no further details.

<TEXT>
   Metropolitan Museum gods were not amused when a
copy of their Zeus statue appeared at another New York museum,
adorned with a baseball bat and a futuristic G-string.
   An artistic and legal struggle ensued, followed by compromise.
The revised version, unveiled at the Whitney Museum Friday, was a
plain Zeus _ displayed with photos of his former self and signs
explaining the controversy.
   It all started in 1930, when the Met bought a bronze replica of
the Zeus, a famous relic from ancient Greece. Several years ago,
the Met loaned the Zeus to the Queens Museum, which in turn loaned
it to the Whitney.
   Enter Spanish-born artist Francesc Torres, whose work titled
``Oikonomos,'' the Greek word for economical, was commissioned for
the Whitney's Biennial Exhibition.
   Torres envisioned a Zeus that symbolized ``the economic
spectrum, the lowest and the highest: from guys who work at the
corner of Broadway and Houston cleaning windshields down to Wall
Street.''
   ``I wanted to use Zeus because, in Greek mythology, Zeus was the
chairman of the board,'' Torres said.
   This statue's right hand _ which traditionally holds a lightning
bolt or javelin _ was empty. So Torres added a baseball bat,
representing a threat to the economy.
   Torres pointed Zeus' left hand toward a video projection screen,
which showed a documentary of street people washing car windows for
change.
   Perhaps the crux of the matter was a 3{-inch video monitor. It
was hung from a piece of twine that was wrapped around the statue's
waist and looped around his genitals _ showing ``the chairman of
the board being hindered by his own power,'' said Torres.
   ``The monitor showed footage of the Stock Exchange from the
mezzanine. That was meshed with car racing material'' to compare a
car crash and the stock market crash, he said.
   The exhibit was opened April 27 and was seen by more than 25,500
visitors.
   On May 11, the Met's Department of Greek and Roman Art notified
the Whitney that it would take back its Zeus unless the
accoutrements were removed.
   The Whitney closed the Zeus gallery May 12, took pictures of it,
and opened the revised version Friday.
   ``It's preposterous but also very fitting, because the piece is
about power,'' Torres said. ``That's precisely what has generated
as a result _ a power backlash.''
   Dietrich von Bothmer, chairman of the Met's Department of Greek
and Roman Art, did not return calls for comment.
   But he told The New York Times earlier: ``Even if the statue is
a reproduction, it is a reproduction of a work of art. The image is
original. Adding material to it changes the intent and I still feel
that universally acknowledged masterpieces of ancient art should be
treated with the respect they deserve.''
   ``They're saying we have betrayed the original intent of the
artist. But who knows what the original intent of the artist was?''
Torres said. ``There is one small gratification I'm getting out of
this. I didn't think that in our blase world something like this
could create such an uproar. We haven't lost all the ammunition
after all.''

<HEAD>Despite Past Scrapes, Maynard Jackson Runs For Atlanta Mayor Again</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SONYA ROSS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Maynard Jackson's enemies haven't forgotten that
he laid off city workers, froze police promotions and snubbed the
city's business administration during his tenure as the city's
first black mayor.
   Still, Jackson appears poised to sail back into City Hall in
October on a wave of populist nostalgia.
   Prominent developer John Portman and Coca-Cola USA President Ira
Herbert are among those who have piled aboard the campaign of
Jackson's sole opponent, Michael Lomax, also a black Democrat and
commission chairman of Fulton County, which includes most of
Atlanta.
   But voters apparently remember Jackson as the lovable, portly
man who married couples, boxed with Muhammad Ali and stood outside
City Hall collecting NAACP donations in a huge cowboy hat.
   Jackson was leading the polls more than a year ago, before he
entered the campaign. That lead ballooned this month: 58 percent to
24 percent for Lomax, according to a poll by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution.
   ``The only think I'm going to say is I'm grateful for all the
support I have,'' Jackson said this week.
   The numbers are bad news for many business people, said
Claibourne Darden, a longtime pollster and political consultant.
   ``A lot of them don't want him back,'' Darden said. ``Maynard
had an anti-establishment, anti-business tone during the last of
his administration.''
   Jackson's angry confrontations with business leaders were a
major theme during his two terms, from 1973 to 1981. Atlanta mayors
are limited to two consecutive four-year terms.
   His temper wasn't reserved for the private sector. He fired
1,000 striking city workers in 1977, rehiring most of them a month
later, and froze police promotions after a mid-1970s scandal
involving cheating on promotions tests.
   But among these offended parties, only big business has clearly
adopted Lomax as its choice in the Oct. 3 non-partisan general
election. Local unions and police organizations have yet to endorse
a candidate.
   Campaign disclosure reports show Lomax has received about
$400,000 in campaign contributions from corporate interests over
the past two years; Jackson has yet to release his campaign
contributor list.
   In a recent television interview, Lomax denied that all his
business support could be attributed to anti-Jackson sentiment.
   ``People are supporting me because they believe I have a good
record as a competent, qualified elected official,'' Lomax said.
``There's no biased view on development on my part, neither for nor
against it.''
   Business leaders' main conflict with Jackson came over his
set-aside program, which awarded chunks of city contracts to
minority companies. Firms owned by blacks and women went from
getting 0.3 percent of city work in 1973 to 27.5 percent in 1981.
   ``What I had was a disagreement on issues, primarily affirmative
action, with some people in the business community who said I was
unyielding on the issue and the reality of it,'' Jackson said. ``I
was unyielding. I had to be.''
   Preservation has emerged as a big issue in this year's campaign,
because of recent highway construction and other building that has
changed the appearance of the city.
   Andrew Young, mayor since Maynard stepped down in 1981, has been
seen as favoring developers. Young cannot seek re-election because
of the two-term limit.
   ``I think that a lot of developers have seen in Mr. Lomax a
willingness to sacrifice quality of life for unrestrained growth.
Their money follows their comfort level with Mr. Lomax,'' Jackson
said. ``I do not believe in allowing our neighborhoods to be
destroyed.''
   Tobe Johnson, a professor at Morehouse College, said the
preservation issue is helping Jackson.
   ``The neighborhoods view Maynard as being protective,'' Johnson
said. ``The rap on Michael is that thus far he has not been.''

<HEAD>Lawmaker Introduces Bill to Make Spreading Computer Viruses a Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Alarmed by reports about the vulnerability of
computer systems to hackers, a Massachusetts state senator has
filed a bill that would make it a crime to enter a computer without
authorization.
   Sen. William Keating, the bill's sponsor, hopes to inoculate
Massachusetts hospitals, universities and businesses against
so-called computer viruses with legislation that would create a new
category of crime analagous to breaking into a building.
   ``It's an attempt to put on the statutes a law that would
penalize people for destruction or deliberate modification or
interference with computer properties,'' Keating said Friday. ``It
clarifies the criminal nature of the wrongdoing and, I think, in
that sense serves as a deterrent and makes clear that this kind of
behavior is criminal activity.''
   The idea for the bill came from a constituent, Elissa Royal, who
has a background in hospital administration and became concerned
about the security of patient files.
   ``I heard about (computer) viruses on the news,'' she said. ``My
first thought was the clinical pathology program. Our doctors would
look at it and make all these decisions without looking at the hard
copy.
   ``I thought, what if some malevolent, bright little hacker got
into the system and changed the information? How many people would
be injured or die?''
   Last November, a Cornell graduate student, Robert T. Morris Jr.,
clogged thousands of computers around the country by unleashing a
set of instructions into Internet, a widely used computer network.
   Keating and experts in the field believe that many cases of
computer viruses go unreported. Often victims file no complaints
because they do not want to attract publicity, or because they
believe prosecutors do not have the laws they need to press charges.
   Under Keating's bill, penalties would increase depending on
whether the attacker merely entered a computer, interfered with its
operations or destroyed data. In the most serious case, any person
found guilty of knowingly releasing a computer virus would be
subject to a maximum of 10 years in prison or $25,000 fine.
   The bill is pending in committee, as staff members are refining
its language to carefully define the term ``virus.''

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
was rallying from kidney, heart and lung failure, but still listed
in very critical condition, a hospital administrator said.
   ``In his current condition, there are periods of high and low,''
Gene Tiwanak, assistant administrator at St. Francis Medical
Center, said Friday. ``I guess you can say this is the time he's on
the upswing, so to speak.''
   Tiwanak said Marcos' fever had subsided and some vital signs had
improved, but the prognosis remained very poor.
   Marcos was on a kidney dialysis machine and a respirator that
was helping him breathe, Tiwanak said. He also was being treated
for pneumonia and bacterial infections.
   ``It is very serious, but he's hanging on,'' said Imelda Marcos,
wife of the 71-year-old deposed leader.
   ``He looks good, stable,'' said Dr. Edmund C.K. Lum, a friend of
Marcos who looks in on the former president every day. ``He will be
OK.''
   Marcos entered the hospital Jan. 15, but he suffered kidney,
heart and lung failure on Thursday.
   Mrs. Marcos made a public appeal Friday to Philippine President
Corazon Aquino to allow Marcos to return to his homeland to die.
   Mrs. Aquino, who came to power when Marcos fled here in 1986,
forbid Marcos' return and said she would not permit him to be
buried in the Philippines, out of concern his presence _ or burial
_ would spark unrest.
   ``I'm confident that sooner or later, the Filipino people will
allow him to come home because there is no reason not to,'' Mrs.
Marcos said.
   Marcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years, many of them under
martial law. After his departure there were several foiled coup
attempts by people linked to Marcos.
   ``The fact is the Marcoses have caused the Philippines a lot of
pain,'' said Tomas ``Buddy'' Gomez, the Philippine consul in
Hawaii. ``They are a bunch of troublemakers, who will utilize this
event as another opportunity for destabilization.
   ``We have every right to protect the state,'' Gomez said. ``We
have every right to protect the advances we have had in democratic
stability and economic progress'' since Marcos fled to exile in
Hawaii.
   The Marcoses are under federal indictment, accused of stealing
more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy art and
real estate in New York. In April a judge ruled that Marcos was too
ill to stand trial, but Mrs. Marcos was charged. She is free on $5
million bail.

   The declaration of martial law in metropolitan
Beijing today was accompanied by strict restrictions on reporting
and photography by the foreign media.
   Mayor Chen Xitong said foreign reporters were banned from
interviewing people on the street, at government offices, schools,
factories and mines. They also are barred from making tapes or
videos that would ``incite or instigate Chinese to march.''
   Photographers were also banned from taking photos under the new
measures.
   No curfew was imposed, however, and it appeared reporters would
be allowed to watch events unimpeded in the streets.
   China, which generally tries to control foreign reporting at the
source rather than interfering with the final product, had not
restricted foreign reporting earlier in the student campaign for
democracy.
   A Hong Kong cameraman reported being taken into police custody
during protests in April, when students tried to storm the
Communist Party headquarters. Several other reporters were pushed
roughly by police, but in general they have been allowed to take
photographs and conduct interviews at will during student marches
and confrontations with police lines.
   The Chinese, however, cut several U.S. television networks' live
transmissions. Normal transmissions from The Associated Press also
went down for several hours this morning, shortly after martial law
was declared.
   The Beijing restrictions are not quite as harsh as they are in
Lhasa, the Tibetan capital and the only other city in China under
martial law. Even before martial law was imposed in Tibet in March,
most reporters were barred. Any one who is in Lhasa when a protest
occurs is barred from even watching it.
   China has expelled foreign reporters in the past during
political crackdowns. Lawrence MacDonald, an American reporting for
Agence France-Presse, was expelled in January 1987 after a
crackdown on previous nationwide student protests. He was accused
of receiving intelligence from a Chinese student.
   A few months later, a Japanese reporter, Shuitsu Henmi of Kyodo
News Service, was expelled on charges of paying a Chinese source
for internal documents regarding the crackdown.
   Both reporters denied the charges.

   A year ago today, a disturbed woman walked
into an elementary school and opened fire on helpless students, a
tragedy that still stirs the pupils but has made them ``stronger in
some ways,'' an official said.
   ``This has been a year in which we have grown a lot and in which
we've come a long way,'' Winnetka schools' Superintendent Donald
Monroe said Friday after an assembly.
   Hubbard Woods Elementary School pupils held classroom
discussions in the morning, then sang at the afternoon assembly
held in the memory of Nicholas Corwin, 8, who was fatally shot by
Laurie Dann on May 20, 1988.
   ``For some of the children there is still some anxiety,'' Monroe
said. ``But for the most part the children in the school are
healthy and well _ and they are stronger in some ways. ``We ...
acknowleged the day and acknowledged how well they're doing and how
far they've come in remembering Nicholas Corwin.''
   Administrators also held a special session for parents, and at
least 60 attended, Monroe said.
   ``They all have some continuing anxiety about the safety issues
and the children, but they seem to be dealing with them very
well,'' he said. ``They feel this year has been a positive school
year and that the children feel comfortable in school and they feel
confident in school.''
   A year ago, Miss Dann, 30, spent 4{ hours delivering poisoned
juice and arsenic-laced snacks to her ex-husband, a psychiatrist
and homes where she had worked as a baby sitter.
   She tried to light a gas bomb at a school in Highland Park and
also set a fire at a Winnetka home where she had once worked.
   Then she carried three guns into the Hubbard Woods school and
shot several students, including Nicholas who died below a
chalkboard.
   She fled to a nearby home and wounded a young man, then fatally
shot herself.
   Miss Dann was being treated for mental illness, but her motive
for the rampage remains unknown.
   School officials tightened security after the shooting, locking
all doors except one during school hours and requiring parents and
other visitors to have identification tags.
   The tragedy also sparked debate over gun control in suburbs
along the Lake Michigan shore. Three suburbs in the past three
months have banned the possession of handguns, and a fourth has
banned the sale and manufacture of handguns.

   Premier Li Peng, a newcomer in the top echelons
of Chinese power, has emerged as a hardliner after ordering martial
law to quash student unrest in Beijing.
   Li, his voice fired with anger, told the nation that the
``anarchic state'' created by nearly five weeks of student protests
``is going from bad to worse.'' He promised to take ``resolute and
decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil.''
   Hours later, the State Council headed by Li announced that much
of the capital had been placed under martial law for the first time
in Communist China's 40-year history.
   For the student protesters, many who have called for Li's
resignation, the 60-year-old former electrical engineer was finally
showing his true colors.
   Li always has described himself as firmly behind China's
economic and political reforms and says those who classify him as a
conservative misunderstand him.
   He also has denied that there was a serious rift, or power
struggle, between himself and Communist Party General Secretary
Zhao Ziyang, generally regarded as a strong proponent of rapid
reform.
   But since last fall Li and Zhao have taken clearly divergent
paths. Li appears to have come out on top.
   Last September, with the nation's market-oriented reform program
reeling from 30 percent inflation and chaotic growth, Li took
control of the economy from Zhao and announced a two-year austerity
plan. Further reforms will be on hold for the duration.
   The latest conflict, over political reforms, has lead to Zhao's
resignation, Chinese sources say.
   Zhao reportedly favored giving in to student demands for a
dialogue to end a wrenching hunger strike by thousands of students.
Li, apparently backed by senior leader Deng Xiaoping, refused to
compromise, and when the students remained defiant, he called in
the troops.
   Li's image as a conservative dates back to his six years as an
engineer student in the Soviet Union in the 1950s, when he was
imbued with the virtues of central planning. He also spent many
years as an engineer in various energy ministries, where the need
for government controls is more apparent.
   Li was elevated to full membership in the party Central
Committee in 1978, became minister of Power Industry in 1979 and
was named vice premier in 1983. He became a member of the party's
power-wielding Politburo Standing Committee in 1987, and shortly
thereafter rose to be acting premier when Zhao moved over to the
top party post.
   Li was named premier 13 months ago.
   Despite the impression Li is a somewhat wooden technocrat _
unlike the suave Zhao _ he has excellent revolutionary credentials.
   His father, a leading Communist fighter, was killed by
Nationalist troops when Li was three, and the young boy was later
among a group of war orphans brought up by the late Premier Chou
En-Lai.

<HEAD>Survivors of `Voyage of the Damned' to Reunite</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Survivors are planning a commemoration of the
cursed 1939 voyage that brought 900 Jewish refugees to the Florida
coast where they were turned away by the Coast Guard.
   Most of the 900 passengers on the steamship St. Louis eventually
perished in Hitler's death camps. Their travails aboard the vessel
became known as the ``Voyage of the Damned.''
   About 20 survivors plan to meet in two weeks for a re-enactment
of the trip on its 50th anniversary, this time with a warm
reception at the Miami Beach Marina.
   The group will sail the Florida Princess to the place where the
St. Louis was forced to turn back, then return to harbor
accompanied by a flotilla of private boats and a Coast Guard cutter.
   ``It's a wonderful thing,'' said North Miami resident Herbert
Karliner, who was 12 years old when he and his family were among
the refugees fleeing Germany aboard the ship.
   It left Hamburg, Germany, for Cuba but was denied permission to
dock in Havana. When the passengers turned to the United States,
the State Department refused to make an exception to a strict quota
system for immigrants.
   On June 4, 1939, the Coast Guard chased the St. Louis from the
Miami Beach coast, Karliner remembered.
   ``I saw the coast of Miami Beach very vividly. I was so
impressed with the palm trees,'' he said this week. ``The Coast
Guard came by and chased us off ... Such a big country wouldn't let
900 people in.''
   On the return voyage, the ship's captain stopped in Belgium,
France, Holland and England _ countries that each agreed to accept
a quarter of the refugees.
   Those in England were safe. But within a year, the Nazis had
invaded the other three countries, and about 90 percent of the St.
Louis passengers on the Continent were killed, Karliner said.
   Karliner's family was sent to France. He and his brother went to
children's homes and survived.
   Their mother, father and two sisters were arrested by French
collaborators and sent to Auschwitz. They were never heard from
again.
   Those attending the reunion, organized by Miami Beach Jewish
leaders, will include eight residents of south Florida. The nephew
of the ship's captain, Gustav Shroeder, will fly in from Hamburg.

   The Chinese government halted live American
telecasts from Beijing as troops closed in on hundreds of thousands
of protesters in Tiananmen Square.
   ``In my 20 years of news reporting I've never seen anything like
this,'' CNN anchorman Bernard Shaw said Friday night.
   ``Goodbye from Beijing,'' he said, signing off.
   Correspondents were able to continue reporting by phone.
   Authorities first stopped transmissions from the square, where
videotapes showed soldiers hitting protesters with nightsticks,
then stopped satellite transmissions altogether.
   Networks were reduced to showing maps and photographs of their
correspondents, who said they hadn't been personally threatened. It
was unclear whether the networks would be able to videotape for
later airing.
   The blackout occurred at the end of a week of coverage of Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev's visit and the accompanying protests.
   Chinese officials used Gorbachev's departure as justification
for the move.
   ``Mr. Gorbachev China visit is over,'' a Chinese official said
to CNN, translating a written order that had been requested by CNN.
``Now I'm here announcing that CNN should stop the movable earth
station and its transmitting frequencies right away.''
   An official at the Atlanta-based Cable News Network said crew
members were trying to negotiate with the Chinese government for
permission to resume news coverage.
   CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said he did not think the CNN crew
was being ordered out of the country.
   Tapes showed CBS News anchorman Dan Rather preparing for a live
telecast from Tiananmen Square about 8:30 p.m. EDT, only to have
the picture turn to interference.
   Viewers saw the unusual sights of CNN and CBS producers haggling
with Chinese officials in hotel hallways and control centers.
   ``He must do what he must do,'' Rather told an interpreter as an
official stood by outside the Hotel Shangri-La. ``But I want him to
understand that I respectfully protest, as strongly as I can,
particularly since he doesn't have anything in writing to break a
written agreement with.''
   CBS spokeswoman Donna Dees said the network had a contract to
broadcast for another 16 or 17 hours. CBS was able to broadcast
from the Hotel Shangri-La for a couple of hours after the Tiananmen
Square blackout.
   ``It's good television and it's good news,'' Dees said. ``We
were prepared to go to Beijing for the summit, and though the
protests were building up, nobody expected it to explode like
this.''
   Bill Baxter of NBC News said the network shared a satellite with
CNN and was unable to get a signal out of China. He said efforts to
book other satellite time were also stymied by the official
blackout.
   ABC had arranged for two satellite feeds Friday night but got
neither of them.
   In a live transmission from the Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in
Beijing, CNN showed a government official writing the official
order _ on a note pad provided by CNN editors _ to shut down the
broadcasts.
   The blackout came about an hour after martial law was declared
in parts of Beijing, including Tiananmen Square, where hundreds of
thousands of Chinese have been demonstrating for political reforms.
   CBS special reports interrupted the season finale of ``Dallas.''
The episode was shown delayed but in its entirety.
   ``We've had some calls, but we always get calls during
interrupts,'' Dees said.

   A Navy training jet crashed in a
cornfield but two pilots ejected just before it hit the ground and
escaped serious injury, officials said.
   The jet, a twin-engine T-2, was on a training flight from Little
Rock, Ark., and crashed Friday about 6 miles east of Scott Air
Force Base.
   The pilots were identified as Marine Capt. Donald F. Meisner,
30, of McHenry, Ill., and Navy Ensign Mike F. Mahon, 24, of Towaco,
N.J.
   Mahon was treated for a broken arm suffered when he freed
himself from his parachute harness, which had hung up in a tree in
a farmer's yard.
   No civilians were injured.
   Navy and Air Force authorities said the pilots declared an
``in-flight emergency'' minutes before the crash. They declined to
elaborate.
   The pilots were on a seven-leg, cross-country training flight
that originated in Kingsville Naval Air Station in Texas. They left
Little Rock Friday morning and planned to stop at Scott before
traveling to Mitchell International Airport in Milwaukee for a
weekend ground exhibition.
   There was a small fire when the jet crashed in the 5-inch-high
corn, said Mike Riley, police chief in New Baden, in southern
Illinois about 25 miles southeast of St. Louis. The debris was
confined to a small area, he said.

<TEXT>
   About 1,000 Ferdinand Marcos
supporters marched today near the presidential palace to demand
their leader's return and cheered when a speaker predicted ``a lot
of dead Americans'' if Marcos dies in exile.
   Marcos, 71, was in critical condition today in a Honolulu
hospital after undergoing emergency kidney surgery.
   President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Marcos to
return from his Hawaiian exile and said her government will not
permit the ousted president to be buried in the Philippines despite
``a last appeal'' from his wife.
   Mrs. Aquino conferred today with five Cabinet members about
Marcos' health, and afterward officials said the ban on the former
president's return _ dead or alive _ still stands.
   About 1,000 Marcos loyalists, chanting ``Bring back Marcos'' and
``Marcos once more,'' marched today from Quezon city to within 100
yards of Mrs. Aquino's office in Malacanang Palace before
plainsclothed police turned them back.
   They withdrew about 150 yards and began a ``prayer vigil'' under
the watchful eyes of about 30 policemen.
   During the rally, radio commentator Leo Obligar warned of a
revolution if Mrs. Aquino does not relent and allow Marcos to die
in the land he ruled for 20 years.
   ``I also assure you that if Marcos dies, there will be a lot of
dead Americans,'' Obligar said as the crowd cheered wildly. ``We
want Marcos to return here to prevent a revolution.''
   Later, Obligar told reporters, ``Filipinos will kill Americans
because it is the Americans who are causing trouble.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Marcos supporters blame the United States for ``kidnapping''
their leader to Hawaii during the 1986 popular uprising that
toppled his government and propelled Mrs. Aquino to power.
   On Friday, Marcos' wife, Imelda, broadcast an appeal to Mrs.
Aquino to allow her husband to die in the Philippines.
   In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs.
Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but
was told the president was busy.

   A Korean-American businessman has been
convicted of conspiring to send nerve gas to Iran and may face
additional charges of espionage, a prosecutor said.
   A federal jury found Juwhan Yun innocent of a charge of trying
to export the deadly gas sarin, but guilty of conspiracy to export
the gas.
   No shipment took place, but Yun, 48, discussed with an
undercover agent the idea of shipping the gas in 500 quarter-ton
bombs.
   U.S. Attorney Samuel A. Alito Jr. said Yun could be charged with
spying for allegedly having classified documents in his office. The
Justice Department, FBI and military officials were considering the
possible indictment, Alito said.
   The conspiracy conviction carries up to five years in prison,
but under sentencing guidelines Yun faces around three years in
jail, attorneys said.
   U.S. District Judge H. Lee Sarokin set sentencing for July 13.
   ``The last chapter hasn't been written,'' said Yun's attorney,
Stephen Dratch.
   He said he would ask Sarokin to set aside the guilty verdict
because the government was obliged to convince the jury of both
charges.
   Dratch had argued during the nearly three-week trial that Yun
was entrapped by a slick undercover agent from the Customs Service
posing as an arms dealer. He maintained that the agent used
economic coercion to entrap Yun.
   Alito said entrapment was the usual argument in such undercover
``stings.''
   ``Without doing these undercover operations, it's virtually
impossible to enforce the arms export laws,'' he said.
   Yun contacted an undercover agent while seeking to make a legal
shipment of artillery shells to South Korea. He discussed buying
the nerve gas with the agent, but called off the deal Jan. 11.
   A day later, he was arrested near Newark International Airport
at what he thought was to be a meeting with a customs official.
   The prosecution succeeded in showing jurors that Yun had
intended to renew the deal when he was arrested.

   Blue-collar workers, white-collar professionals
and students demonstrating for democratic reform swarmed around
troop trucks today in an effort to prevent a government crackdown
from ending their protest.
   It was a kind of ``people power'' different from what
revolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung believed could modernize China
without foreign funds or technology and enable the country to
survive a nuclear attack.
   The people power displayed today was similar to that that pulled
down Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines in 1986. But the outcome
of today's action was far from clear.
   ``Li Peng, step down! Xiaoping, step down!'' many shouted as
they sped in trucks across the city toward where soldiers of the
27th and 28th armies were entering from the eastern and western
suburbs.
   The chants referred to Premier Li Peng, who signed today's order
imposing martial law in much of Beijing, and 84-year-old leader
Deng Xiaoping, who was believed the main force behind the crackdown.
   Others bicycled or ran to the scene, or pleaded with passing
cars and trucks for a lift.
   At a traffic circle in western Beijing, about five miles from
Tiananmen Square, about 500 people swarmed around 15 army trucks,
each containing a dozen or more soldiers. The soldiers sat
impassively, looking out the back from under canvas covers, as the
protesters earnestly lectured them about the month-old student
movement for reforms such as a free press and rights guarantees.
   ``Maybe you don't understand the real situation,'' a woman told
the soldiers in one truck. ``You haven't been to the square, you
don't know what it's like there.''
   ``We are people and you are people, why do you have no
feelings?'' several recited in unison. ``Your brothers and sisters
may be university students. You should join the people hand in
hand, heart to heart, for you, too, are Chinese!''
   ``We appeal to people in all walks of life: boycott class,
boycott teaching, strike from work and strike from commerce!'' one
youth sitting on the hood of an army truck bellowed through a
megaphone at soldiers. The crowd went wild.
   They went even wilder, clapping their hands in the air, when a
uniformed policeman joined workers on a truck bed. ``Come on out!''
he urged the soldiers, huddled in their trucks.
   ``Army, come out!'' the crowd took up the chant. No soldiers did.
   After hours of haranguing from the protesters, the soldiers
turned around and left in the direction they had come. The crowd
cheered. Some soldiers smiled, waved and flashed V-for-victory
signs.
   Up and down Beijing's main avenue, Changan, students, medics and
other supporters stood by the hundreds at intersections to form
human barricades. In many places, metal and concrete lane dividers
were torn from the pavement and thrown across the pavement to block
vehicles.

<HEAD>Tbilisi Children Suffer Symptoms Similar to Gas Poisoning</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Schoolchildren in Soviet Georgia have mysteriously
fallen ill with symptoms similar to those suffered by protesters
who were gassed in a demonstration last month, the official news
agency Gruzinform said today.
   The agency confirmed an earlier report from activists that
children from five or six schools in Tbilisi got sick weeks after a
April 9 clash between demonstrators and troops in the Georgian
capital left 20 protesters dead.
   Many protesters were hospitalized with nerve damage that doctors
attributed to the gas used by troops. Military officials, however,
deny using nerve gas.
   An editor at Gruzinform said the latest victims, including small
children in kindergartens, suffered mild versions of the illness
and none were hospitalized. He did not have the number of children
involved or the dates they became sick.
   At least 20 children who became ill shortly after the clash were
students in a school adjacent to the scene of the demonstration.
Soldiers reportedly chased demonstrators into their school and
sprayed the gas inside the building.
   There was no apparent explanation for the new illnesses. The
Gruzinform spokesman said a commission of deputies to the new
Soviet Parliament was investigating.
   Georgian schools were closing for the summer today on schedule,
the editor said.

<HEAD>Falling Gold Price Endangers Mines, Jobs in South Africa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The falling price of gold, at
its lowest level on world markets since 1986, has caused two gold
mines to suspend stock exchange trading and threatens about 15
marginally profitable mines that may have to close if the price
drops further, precious metals experts say.
   South Africa is the world's largest producer of gold, supplying
34 percent of the total. Export sales of an estimated 600 tons a
year provide half the country's annual foreign exchange earnings.
   This week's price plunge to $365 an ounce comes just as the
annual wage negotiations have begun between the major mining
companies and the black National Union of Mineworkers.
   A year ago gold was around $450 an ounce. Analysts attribute the
fall to a strengthening dollar and an increase in the world's gold
supply.
   Rand Mines Ltd. on Friday suspended listings on the
Johannesburg, Paris and London stock exchanges for two of its
oldest gold mines.
   The company said that at prevailing prices, the mines are
incurring substantial losses, and it appealed for more government
financial assistance to keep them operating.
   The two mines are Durban Roodeport Deep, which employs 8,177
blacks and 496 whites; and East Rand Proprietary Mines, where
10,289 blacks and 1,155 whites work.
   East Rand has received government assistance for some time, said
Rand Mines spokesman Greg Kukard, because production costs exceeded
revenue last year by about $12 per ton of milled gold.
   The National Union of Mineworkers, which represents nearly half
of the country's 600,000 black miners, believes companies should
use some profits from viable mines to keep marginal mines running
and support employment.
   The union opened annual wage negotiations Wednesday demanding a
uniform minimum wage of $222 a month for underground miners and
$210 for surface workers.
   Such a policy would mean pay increases of up to 100 percent for
some workers.
   Officials at the Chamber of Mines, which represents the major
mining houses, have warned that drastic increases in wages would
place 15 marginal mines in jeopardy, in an industry where an
estimated 17,000 jobs have been lost in the past 17 months.
   The Star, the country's largest newspaper, reported Friday that
the government has been cushioning the immediate effects of the
lower gold price on the industry by allowing the currency to fall
to 2.70 rands per dollar Friday afternoon.
   The gold price has fallen $9 in the past week, and $35 since the
beginning of the year, ``which could cost South Africa almost $700
million in a year, The Star estimated.

<HEAD>Medical Examiner Rules Death of Linares Baby Accidental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Cook County medical examiner has ruled that a
15-month-old boy unhooked by his father from a respirator died of
accidental causes.
   Dr. Robert J. Stein made the ruling Friday, the day after a
grand jury declined to indict the father, Rudy Linares, 23, who
removed his son's life support and held off hospital staff with a
gun on April 26.
   Samuel Linares had been comatose since accidentally swallowing a
balloon last August. Officials at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's
Medical Center had refused the family's request to withdraw
life-support.
   Linares on Thursday pleaded guilty to unlawful use of a weapon,
a misdemeanor, and was released on the condition he undergo
psychological evaluation and possible counseling.
   Stein said he reviewed the grand jury's decision before changing
the death certificate from undetermined to accidental.
   ``When the child was brought originally to MacNeal hospital (in
August) it had aspirated a balloon,'' Stein said Friday. ``In my
opinion, the child was dead at that particular time.''
   Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's, where the boy was transferred from
MacNeal Memorial Hospital, had claimed the boy was not brain-dead,
but Stein disagreed.
   ``The person was dead,'' he said. ``The only thing you kept
living was the organs. I think this is exactly what the jury feels
and the state's attorney feels.''
   State's Attorney Cecil A. Partee said his office decided not to
seek other felony charges against Linares after abandoning pursuit
of the murder count because the young father probably ``had
suffered quite enough.''

<HEAD>Trial Of Racist Mass Murderer Stirs Fears Of More Violence</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The highly publicized trial of
a white supremacist who killed seven blacks and an Asian could
incite further violence by right-wing extremists, a prominent
newspaper editor said today.
   The warning by Harvey Tyson, editor of The Star of Johannesburg,
followed a week of dramatic testimony in the trial of Barend
Strydom, a 23-year-old former policeman who killed or wounded more
than 20 blacks during a shooting spree on the sidewalks of downtown
Pretoria in November.
   Strydom was convicted of eight counts of murder on Tuesday. Over
the next three days, he and his father outlined their racist views
as part of proceedings to determine whether Strydom should be
sentenced to death.
   Sentencing is expected next week.
   Strydom told the Pretoria Supreme Court that his actions were
justifiable and said he would do the same again if given the
chance. His father, also a former policeman, said he believed
blacks were animals, not humans.
   Both father and son belong to the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement. Fellow members of the group have attended the trial to
show solidarity with the defendant.
   Tyson, whose newspaper is South Africa's largest-selling daily,
said in a column that the extensive local news coverage of the
trial ``bodes ill for a country which has bred so many extremists.''
   ``We may be witnessing an increase in the growth of the
ultra-right's incoherent killing,'' he wrote. ``It seems more than
likely that Barend Strydom's actions could be repeated, not just by
a madman but by sane members of a secret group in our society.''
   Tyson said he had received an anonymous death threat in the mail
last week.
   Police have been investigating Strydom's claims that he belonged
to a clandestine right-wing terror group called the Wit Wolwe
(White Wolves), but senior officers say they doubt such a group
exists.
   A weekly anti-apartheid newspaper, Vyre Weekblad (Free Weekly),
reported Friday that Stydom had handed a letter to one of its
reporters claiming that the Wit Wolwe were responsible for the
``removal'' of David Webster, a white anti-apartheid activist who
was assassinated on May 1.
   The letter also indicated the group was responsible for a recent
bombing that damaged the home of a Parliament member of the
governing National Party.
   In his testimony, Strydom claimed that Wit Wolwe leaders had
instructed him to try to kill Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu and
the Rev. Allan Boesak, two anti-apartheid church leaders.
   Dozens of activists, almost all of them black, have been slain
in recent years, but in only one case has there been a murder
conviction. Police have made no arrests in connection with
Webster's killing.
   ``It is vitally important that all political killers are brought
to book as quickly as possible,'' Tyson wrote. ``For if justice is
not swift and seen to be impartial, communal insanity will grow.''

<DATELINE>CHANDIGARH, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sikh extremists slipped into the house
of a Communist Party leader in the northern state of Punjab today
and killed him and four relatives as they slept, police said.
   A police official in Chandigarh, the state capital, identified
the victims as Dalip Singh, his wife, daughter, son, and
daughter-in-law. Dalip Singh, a Sikh, was the local leader of the
Communist Party of India-Marxist.
   A news agency, United News of India, said Singh's 2-year-old
grandson and a 3-year-old granddaughter, who were severely wounded
in the early morning shooting, also died.
   The police official in Chandigarh said four Sikhs armed with
Chinese-made assault rifles scaled a wall around Singh's house in
Chak Rahian village and opened fire on the people sleeping in the
courtyard. The village is 135 miles west of Chandigarh.
   The extremists came in a jeep and fled in the same vehicle, said
the official who cannot be identified under briefing rules.
   Mattresses and bed sheets were soaked in blood and bodies were
lying in the courtyard, he said, quoting reports from Chak Rahian.
   The militants, who want to set up a separate nation in Punjab,
previously have killed fellow Sikhs who do not symathize with their
cause. They have also killed left-wing politicians for opposing the
separatist movement.
   Sikhs form 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are in a
slight majority in Punjab, a rich farming state bordering Pakistan.
   Sikhs allege they are discriminated against by the majority
Hindus and the Hindu-dominated national government.
   The 7-year-old bloody separatist campaign has claimed at least
735 lives this year.

<HEAD>Soviet Ambassador Meets Party Officials About Krakow Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet ambassador has met with local
Communist Party leaders in Krakow to express his country's concern
over anti-Soviet protests there earlier this week, official
newspapers reported today.
   Jozef Gajewicz, first secretary of the provincial party branch,
and Krakow mayor Tadeusz Salwa voiced regret over the protests that
occurred on three succesive days, the Warsaw daily newspaper Zycie
Warszawy said.
   Protests supported by the banned pacifist group Freedom and
Peace resulted in 45 detentions on Tuesday.
   At least 10 poeple were injured Wednesday, and young people
protesting police intervention during those demonstrations clashed
with police on Thursday. About 300 people took part in each of the
demonstrations.
   The mostly youthful crowds shouted ``Soviets go home'' and
attempted to march to the Soviet Consulate.
   The Soviet ambassador, Vladimir Brovikov, met Gajewicz and Salwa
on Friday, the newspaper said.
   University and college rectors also met Friday, and the Krakow
academic community has disassociated itself from the protests, the
newspaper said.
   Shouting ``Soviets go home'' is a recent development in street
protests in Poland. The slogan is popular mainly among young
people, although a feeling that Soviet troops should withdraw has
existed in the country for many years.
   In a statement on Friday, Freedom and Peace said its movement
has always taken action advocating peace in Europe. ``United Europe
is Europe without foriegn troops,'' the statement said.
   ``We believe it is in the interest of peace on our continent for
the Soviet army to withdraw from the whole East bloc including
Polish territory. We want dialogue with the Russian nation, but not
under pressure of stationed Soviet troops,'' the statement said.
   According to the Institute for International and Strategic
Studies in London, there are about 40,000 Soviet troops stationed
in Poland.
   Earlier this week, the official news agency PAP said a tank
regiment and a motorized unit would soon be withdrawn from Poland.
The institute says a tank regiment usually includes 1,300 troops
and a motorized unit about 2,300.
   Late last year, in a speech at the United Nations in New York,
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said his country would reduce
its armed forces by 500,000 trooops over two years, including a
reduction of 240,000 in Europe.

<HEAD>Burmese And Thai Troops Reportedly Clash Inside Thailand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 Burmese government troops
clashed with Thai soldiers today after crossing the border to
launch an attack on a Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said.
   He said a group of 400 soldiers crossed the Moei River boundary
into Mae Sot's Ban Wangkaew village, which has been evacuated due
to the fighting, to set up heavy weapons to shell the camp. Some of
them also seized control of a road about five miles from Mae Sot,
he said.
   Thai forces fired into the village, but the Burmese soldiers
still remained in the evening, said the officer, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   A 64-year-old Thai man was wounded in the clash, and Thai
soldiers and paramilitary personnel were sent in as reinforcements.
   The officer said Thai forces fired artillery rounds as warnings
to a second group of 100 Burmese soldiers who crossed into another
area of Mae Sot.
   ``They are attacking across the river and fighting us from the
Thai side,'' said a Karen official who asked not to be named. He
said the offensive was the largest since 1977 and that thousands of
Karen civilians had fled to Thailand.
   The Thai officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hills
in Burma continued attacking Kaw Moo Ra with heavy shells today,
setting much of the Burmese camp ablaze. Fierce fighting was
reported in one part of the camp.
   He estimated that 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp
against about 3,000 soldiers.
   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, but the
Bangkok government has sent top level delegations to Burma to
discuss the situation. Last year, the military government in Burma
killed hundreds of Burmese during widepsread demonstrations for
democracy.
   After putting down the demonstrations, the Burmese army renewed
its battle with the Karens, who began their revolt in 1949, the
year after Burma achieved independence from Great Britain. The
rebels said at the time that the government reneged on its promise
of more autonomy for ethnic minorities.
   The Karen National Union has an estimated 4,000 combatants and
is the largest of the 10 ethnic insurgent groups in the National
Democratic Front.
   Kaw Moo Ra is in Karen State and is 140 miles east of Rangoon,
the Burmese capital. Government forces began shelling it Thursday,
two days after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, about
two miles to the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold to be captured by army
units since the government launched a bloody dry season offensive
in October. A government spokesman said Friday in Rangoon that at
least 43 rebels were killed in the battle for Wangkha. He said 35
soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.
   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the border
along Mae Sot district in Thailand's northern province of Tak.
   Thai officials say the Burmese offensive has disrupted the
cross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with funds
for their insurgency.

<TEXT>
   The founders of Hewlett-Packard Co.,
the $10 billion computer and electronics giant, returned after 50
years to the garage where they started out for the dedication of
the building as a state landmark.
   It was in the wooden garage that William R. Hewlett and David
Packard in 1938 parlayed $538 in capital and an audio oscillator
into one of the world's leading electronics companies.
   Their company, which employs 87,000 people, is has headquarters
a couple of miles away in Palo Alto.
   But after poking around the dark and dingy interior during the
dedication Friday, Hewlett and Packard said they did not accept its
billing as ``birthplace of Silicon Valley,'' and were not eager to
reminisce. A plaque is to be set in a sandstone rock in front of
the garage to mark its landmark status.
   Packard, asked how did it felt to return after half a century,
said:
   ``It makes me feel pretty old and decrepit.''
   ``I feel the same way,'' said Hewlett.
   Although both are billionaires, neither has thought about buying
the property at 367 Addison Ave., which has become a favorite photo
stop for touring Japanese electronics groups and young Stanford
engineers.
   ``Why would we?'' Hewlett said. ``It's a bunch of junk.''
   Packard said it was the first time they'd been back to the
garage since 1939. Packard and his wife rented the 1905-vintage
wood-shingle house in front and Hewlett rented a cottage out back.
   Hewlett, who is 76 today, and Packard, 76, have long retired
from daily management of the company, though they remain its
largest shareholders. Hewlett resigned as vice chairman of the
board in 1987; Packard remains chairman.
   Hewlett-Packard's success spurred the growth of the region
around Stanford University that became known as Silicon Valley. The
area got its name from the silicon wafers used to make most
computer chips or semiconductors.
   Hewlett said he doesn't think the garage should be called the
birthplace of the valley.
   ``We had practically nothing to do with silicon and we weren't
the first (company) in the valley,'' he said.
   About half a dozen electrical products companies were in the San
Francisco Bay area in 1938, Hewlett said, including a vacuum tube
factory in nearby Redwood City run by Charles Litton. His company
later became Litton Industries, a huge manufacturer of high-tech
appliances.
   A few hundred Hewlett-Packard employees threw a street party
outside the garage, complete with balloons, a brass band and food
kiosks, but neither of the founders seemed excited about the
landmark designation.
   ``The only trouble is, you can't tear it down now,'' Hewlett
said.
   ``I'm not very strong on reminiscing,'' said Packard. ``I think
we ought to be looking forward instead of backward.''
   The audio oscillator that the two started out with was a $79.50
model of a $400 machine sold by another company in the 1930s. The
oscillator emits various frequencies, allowing the testing of sound
equipment, telephones, amplifiers and talking pictures. Walt Disney
bought eight Hewlett-Packard oscillators to help make the movie
``Fantasia.''
   Packard couldn't remember how much rent he paid for the house
and garage, but guessed it probably was less than $25 a month. The
house, in what has become an upscale neighborhood, now rents for
$1,650.

   Israeli troops wounded nine Palestinians during
clashes today in the occupied territories, Arab reports said, and
two Palestinian teen-agers died of gunshot wounds suffered in
earlier violence.
   Troops maintained a curfew on most of the occupied Gaza Strip,
keeping more than 600,000 residents indoors for a second straight
day, Arab reports said.
   Merchants in the West Bank city of Hebron staged a general
strike, according to Arab reports, a day after a gun battle in the
area claimed the lives of an Israeli soldier and three Arab
guerrillas.
   The latest fatalities raised the Palestinian death toll in the
17-month-old uprising against Israeli rule to 494. Twenty-two
Israelis have also died.
   Mazni Abu Hatla, 13, died today in a hospital of a bullet wound
in the chest suffered during a confrontation on Friday that claimed
the lives of four other Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, Arab
reports said.
   An army spokesman confirmed four were killed Friday in the
southern Gaza city of Rafah during a clash between troops and Arab
protesters.
   Arab reports said the Rafah demonstration was caused by anger
over a nearly 2-week-long curfew in the area. A U.N. relief
official denied earlier reports that the Palestinians were
protesting a food shortage.
   ``Because of the uncertainty with extended curfews, people may
be anxious about keeping their stocks up but aren't suffering any
real shortages,'' the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Most of the refugee-packed Gaza Strip has been under curfew
since Monday, with only a daylong respite on Thursday.
   Also today, 18-year-old Ali Abdallah Mohammed Abdallah died from
a gunshot wound in the head he suffered during a May 10 clash in
the West Bank village of Khader, Arab reports said. The army
confirmed Abdallah's death.
   Violence was reported Friday night and today in four cities and
refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arab reports said.
   Israeli soldiers reportedly shot and injured two youths in
Gaza's Shati refugee camp. Seven other people were injured by
rubber bullets or beatings in Nablus, Idna and El Farah in the West
Bank, Arab hospital reports said.
   Arab reports said the clash in Nablus, the West Bank's largest
city of 120,000, began as soldiers dispersed a march by 150
activists of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a
faction of the PLO.
   The marchers reportedly held signs denouncing PLO Chief Yasser
Arafat for being too moderate toward Israel. The United States
recently began a dialogue with the PLO after it recognized Israel's
right to exist.

<HEAD>Quayle Accuses Gorbachev Of Making Phony Arms Control Offers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vice President Dan Quayle has accused Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of making phony arms-reduction
offers that amount to little more than ``PR gambits,'' The
Washington Post reported today.
   The newspaper said Quayle told a group of reporters Friday that
``I certainly accept'' and find ``nothing troubling'' about White
House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater's description of Gorbachev
as a ``drugstore cowboy.''
   ``A drugstore cowboy in a sense connotes a bit of phoniness,''
Quayle said. ``And there is a bit of phoniness about the
(Gorbachev) proposals. He is perceived as making radical proposals
out there when they are really marginal,'' particularly the latest
proposal for a unilateral reduction of Warsaw Pact conventional
weapons.
   Quayle said Gorbachev's popularity in the West ``makes it more
difficult for us''' and that having a Soviet leader who is ``very
pleasing to the West, has an easy mannerism to him, who is very
good from a public relations, press, PR point of view, makes it
harder for the U.S. to gain public approval that is needed to
maintain some its defense postures.''
   In another story, The Post today quoted Senate Majority Leader
George J. Mitchell, D-Maine, as accusing President Bush of a
``narrow, shortsighted'' and timid response to Gorbachev's
diplomatic initiatives.
   ``What has concerned me is the emergence in recent weeks of a
negative tone within the administration ... a (tendency) to respond
to Gorbachev's initiatives by engaging in name-calling,'' Mitchell
said.
   He said it is ``particularly non-productive'' to ``say what he
(Gorbachev) is doing is intended to influence public opinion. Of
course it is. So are actions that we take every day.'

   A Soviet air force captain was wounded by
gunfire as he fled a Soviet airport in a fighter jet today and flew
to Turkey, where he requested political asylum in the United
States, Turkish officials said.
   The MiG-29 aircraft landed about 5 a.m. at the airport in the
the Black Sea coastal city of Trabzon, said Foreign Ministry
spokesman Inal Batu.
   He identified the pilot as Capt. Alexander Zulyef of the
Mikatachaya unit of the Soviet air force. Zulyef was wounded in the
arm, apparently as he took off from an airport north of the Soviet
Black Sea coastal city of Batumi.
   The pilot underwent surgery and was in good condition at the
Black Sea University Medical School hospital in Trabzon, Batu told
reporters.
   Turkish officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
expected the pilot would be granted political sanctuary.
   Later, as Zulyef was being interrogated by Turkish authorities
in Trabzon, he requested asylum in the United States, according to
the city's governor, Enver Hizlan. The request was forwarded to the
Interior Ministry.
   U.S Embassy officials in Ankara refused to comment on the
incident.
   Batu said the Soviet ambassador was called to the Foreign
Ministry and told that the plane would be returned.
   The incident was not reported in the Soviet media.
   The semi-official Anatolia News Agency, quoting local officials,
said the plane was picked up by Turkish radar and the pilot was
warned to turn back but insisted on landing after lengthy radio
conversation with Turkish officials.
   Anatolia, without elaborating, said the plane was fully armed
and a pistol was found in the cockpit.
   The MiG-29 carries six air-to-air missiles and is able to carry
bombs and 57mm, 80mm and 240mm rockets. There is also one 30mm gun.

   Police used a steamroller Saturday to
crush about 6,000 watches with famous but phony brand names, part
of a crackdown on Bangkok's booming market in fake luxury items.
   Crushed on the street in front of a riverside police station
were watches carrying brand names such as Cartier, Rolex, Gucci,
Omega, Longines and Seiko.
   The watches are openly sold at numerous street stalls in the
Thai capital. A fake Rolex sells for about $35, compared with more
than $1,000 for some authentic models.
   The United States in particular has complained about Thailand's
wholesale piracy of foreign goods, patents, copyrights and
trademarks.

dynamite went off too soon, the coast guard said Saturday.
   Chief Petty Officer Crisanto Sy said the men were killed Friday
just off the island of Rapu-Rapu, about 230 miles southeast of
Manila. He said a stick of dynamite blew up as soon as one of the
fishermen lit the fuse.
   One other person was wounded and the canoe the fishermen were in

<HEAD>Panama Bars Street Protests During OAS Visit</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with government banning demonstrations.
No pickup.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today prohibited
street demonstrations in Panama until at least June 5.
   The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique
saying the prohibition was imposed in response to the visit next
week by delegates from the Organization of American States, or OAS.
   The move came after Panama accused the U.S. Embassy of
involvement in post-election violence earlier this month that left
three opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards dead.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala and Trinidad and
Tobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are
due in Panama on Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of
Panama's 15-month-old crisis.
   The OAS on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of Panama's
de facto leader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, whom it held
responsible for ``abuses.''
   International observers say opposition candidates were winning
the national election on May 7 when the government annulled the
results. Since then, there has been no decision on how to select a
replacement for acting President Manuel Solis Palma, whose term
ends Sept. 1.
   The government said the prohibition of marches, rallies and
demonstrations is in response to the clause in the OAS resolution
calling on ``the authorities and all political forces in Panama to
abstain from any measure or action that could aggravate the
crisis.''
   The government communique said the prohibition will remain in
effect until the three foreign ministers present their report on
the Panamanian situation at OAS headquarters in Washington. The OAS
gave them until June 5 to do so.
   Late Friday, U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone, responding
to a government communique, said the attempt to link the U.S.
government to the election-related violence was ``propaganda
foolishness.''
   Police arrested 17 Panamanians who provide security at U.S.
Embassy offices, the embassy reported Friday. Fifteen were quickly
released, embassy officials said.
   The government said the guards were questioned as part of an
investigation into violence May 10, three days after the national
election.
   The 17 work for the same private security company that employed
an opposition politician's bodyguard who was killed and another who
was wounded when Noriega supporters attacked members of the
opposition with sticks, pipes and rubber whips.
   The government claimed the bodyguards were trained by the U.S.
military, whose presence was bolstered when President Bush recently
sent in nearly 1,900 troops to U.S. bases to protect American
nationals in the country.
   Also Friday, the pro-Noriega news media attacked the OAS, saying
it had prostituted itself in approving a resolution critical of
Panama.
   The newspaper Critica printed a half-page cartoon on Friday
showing a naked Oscar Arias, president of Costa Rica and winner of
the Nobel Peace Prize, licking the feet of a U.S. Army general.
Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez was shown waiting his turn
to do the same.
   The governments of Arias and Perez promoted the resolution
adopted Wednesday by the OAS that criticized Noriega, who also is
head of the 15,000-strong Defense Forces.
   The 17 Panamanians who were detained work for Tesna Protective
Services, an American company that operates in Panama under the
name Minsa. The company provides by contract 87 employees who serve
as security personnel for U.S. diplomatic offices. They are not
employees of the U.S. Embassy.
   The bodyguard killed in the May 10 violence was Alexis Guerra, a
Minsa employee who was on leave from the company while he protected
opposition vice presidential candidate Guillermo Ford. Among the
wounded was another bodyguard, Humberto Montenegro, who had been
employed by Minsa until early this year when he resigned to work as
Ford's bodyguard. The government has said five Defense Force
soldiers were injured in the melee.
   A communique issued Friday night by the attorney general's
office accused the U.S. Embassy of lying to the media about the
detention of the 17 Minsa employees and claimed the embassy
presented the detentions as harassment.
   The statement also said ``high authorities'' of the U.S. Embassy
assigned Guerra and Montenegro to guard Ford. It claimed the two
men and other Minsa guards were trained in the use of arms and
explosives by U.S. military units stationed in Panama.
   Kneebone said both allegations were false. He said the embassy
conferred with the 15 who were released.

   A giant sea turtle towed five weak
and weary survivors to safety after their boat sank during the
height of tropical storm Brenda, a newspaper reported Saturday.
   The nationally circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer said the
survivors were passengers on the nine-ton vessel Albert, which sank
Tuesday during the storm off the southeastern tip of Luzon island.
   The Inquirer quoted one of the survivors, Emilia Briones, 25, as
saying the five stayed afloat for three days on a makeshift raft
before they spotted the sea turtle.
   They tied the raft to one of the turtle's legs and the big
amphibian towed the craft for two hours before they were spotted by
fishermen in the coastal town of Presentacion, about 200 miles
southeast of Manila, Briones was quoted as saying.
   Briones said there were 10 people on the raft but five of them
were swept away by waves and drowned. Five other passengers of the
Albert were missing and also feared drowned.
   Briones said the survivors released the turtle after they were
rescued by the fishermen.
   A Coast Guard spokesman confirmed the report about fishermen
saving the survivors but would not say whether the report about the
turtle was true.

   Riot police broke up protests and
arrested more than 1,000 people Saturday after the government
deployed 17,000 troopers to block a rally by dissidents calling for
the fall of the president.
   Thousands of riot troopers in combat fatigues and black helmets
flooded central Seoul, conducting street checks for radical
supporters and guarding key government buildings.
   Police charged hundreds of protesters who tried to block streets
and chant anti-government slogans in the city center. Struggling
protesters were taken away on buses. Police said more than 1,000
people were arrested.
   ``Punish Roh Tae-woo!'' and ``Drive out the Yankees!''
protesters yelled.
   About 120 students courted arrest by laying down in one main
street with their arms and legs interlocked. Police hauled the
students away as other protesters screamed abuse, but there were no
clashes.
   Riot police also blocked protests in the rural cities of Chonju,
Sungnam and Taegu. Small protest marches were allowed in eight
other cities after organizers obtained police permission.
   The United National Democratic Movement, the nation's main
dissident alliance, had called for a major protest in Seoul to push
for President Roh's downfall and to mark the anniversary of a May,
1980, uprising in the southern city of Kwangju.
   The movement issued a statement denouncing the government for
blocking the rally and said police had violated political rights.
Even after the rally was blocked, protesters tried to demonstrate
in the city center.
   Eight radical students armed with iron bars tried to attack the
Seoul headquarters of the Joint Investigation Team, which has been
spearheading a major crackdown on the dissident movement. Guards
stopped the students and seized two of them while the others fled,
police said.
   Police said four students briefly occupied a government
prosecutor's office in Suwon near Seoul before being overpowered
and arrested.
   Police banned the Seoul rally on grounds it was a threat to
public order, and thousands of riot police ringed the street where
it was to have been held. They stopped and questioned people who
approached the area, taking many into custody.
   Troopers in the downtown area also stopped and questioned
people, asking to see identity cards and checking bags for weapons
and anti-government leaflets. Suspects were bundled onto police
buses and taken away for questioning.
   Hundreds of riot police guarded key government buildings and the
U.S. Embassy.
   In other protests, about 500 people marched in Kwangju to call
for Roh's fall. The march was blocked by about 2,000 riot police in
the city's main square, and the protesters hurled eggs and rocks at
troopers.
   The Kwangju protest was the smallest since daily protests began
May 11 to mark the anniversary's uprising. Crowds estimated at up
to 100,000 took part in protests there last week.
   Dissidents have mounted a series of violent anti-government
protests and labor strikes in recent months to call for the
overthrow of the Roh. But the dissidents lack popular support
because of their violent tactics and extreme views.
   Roh, a former general, won a presidential election in late 1987
and has introduced broad democratic reforms, but dissidents claim
he is a front for military rule.
   One of the dissidents' demands is expulsion of the 43,000 U.S.
troops based in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. They
contend the soldiers hamper reunification with communist North
Korea.
   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the peninsula was
divided at the end of World War II. The two sides fought the Korean
War in 1950-53.

<HEAD>Bush, Mitterrand Consider Compromise on NATO Nuclear Dispute</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: Tops with seven new grafs with Mitterrand arrival, Bush quotes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said today he was
ready to ``go one-on-one in a relaxed personal way'' as he began a
series of meetings with French President Francois Mitterrand to
discuss an upcoming NATO summit.
   Bush and Mitterrand met amid reports of a compromise on NATO's
short-range nuclear arsenal.
   Bush greeted Mitterrand at the president's oceanside compound
here. Mitterrand arrived by helicopter and was to spend the day and
part of Sunday with Bush.
   Speaking to reporters moments before Mitterrand arrived, Bush
said, ``I view this meeting as very important for bilateral
relations which are very strong ... I'm looking forward to
informal, in depth, wide-ranging consultations with President
Mitterrand.''
   Bush said that he hoped the meeting would help to ``refurbish
that relationship and strengthen it on a personal basis because I
do believe that you avoid misunderstandings if you go one-on-one in
a relaxed, personal way.''
   Mitterrand landed at the helipad set up at the Bush compound on
a rocky point jutting into the Atlantic ocean. As the French leader
stepped from the helicopter, Bush clapped his hands twice and
welcomed Mitterrand saying, ``Bien venue.''
   Bush brushed off questions on the current turmoil in China and
the proposed compromise on short-range missiles in Europe, saying,
``I'll talk to you tomorrow.'' Bush and Mitterrand have a joint
news conference set for Sunday in Boston after the president's
address to commencement ceremonies at Boston University.
   Although U.S. officials disputed reports from West Germany that
a compromise had been nailed down, the issue was expected to be
high on the agenda today in the meeting between the two leaders
prior to the upcoming NATO meeting in Brussels.
   Even as the president was exploring ways to end the disagreement
among Atlantic allies on the future of nuclear weapons in Europe,
his administration was reacting cautiously to the current turmoil
in China.
   After a day of silence on the efforts by the Beijing government
to crack down on student demonstrators, White House press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater issued a statement Friday night urging restraint
on ``both sides.''
   China declared martial law in parts of the capital Saturday and
declared a news blackout on the demonstrations for political reform.
   ``The announcement of a news blackout is very disturbing and we
urge that it not signal an end to appropriate restraint or an end
to dialogue with the students,'' Fitzwater said.
   On the subject of NATO's nuclear arsenal, a senior White House
official with the president said Friday night the administration
had received a West German proposal for a compromise and had
suggested some changes in the wording, but had not yet heard back
from the Bonn government.
   In Bonn, a senior West German official said Friday that
Washington and West Germany have worked out a formula for a
face-saving compromise in the dispute.
   West Germany has called for U.S.-Soviet talks on eliminating
American-made Lance short-range missiles from western Europe. The
Bush administration has vigorously opposed holding such talks until
the Soviet superiority in conventional weapons is erased.
   Under the potential compromise, the United States would accept
the idea of negotiations with the Kremlin if West Germany makes
clear it does not seek immediate elimination of short-range nuclear
weapons.
   Such an agreement would be largely symbolic, since no date has
been proposed for the start of such talks and they would remain
conditional on an unspecified improvement in the East-West balance
of conventional arms, said the West German official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The senior White House official, also demanding his name not be
used, said: ``The United States returned a paper to the Germans
with a number of explicit conditions to consider. No responses have
yet been received. As far as we know, we do not have an agreement.''
   Mitterrand has generally sided with the United States in the
dispute. He said this week in Paris, however, there is no urgent
need to upgrade NATO's nuclear arsenal, despite U.S. insistence
that the aging Lance missiles be modernized and their range
extended.
   Fitzwater said Friday that Mitterrand ``shares our general
concern for the strength of the NATO alliance'' and that the issues
he raised ``is subject to discussion.''
   France is a member of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, but does not share in its military command. France
has its own short-range nuclear weapons, which it has already
announced it plans to upgrade.
   Fitzwater said the two leaders ``will discuss a wide range of
issues related to U.S.-French relations. Certainly, they'll talk
about the NATO summit'' May 29-30.
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg ended two days
of talks with Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Friday in
Washington, saying the two had ``made progress'' towards a common
stance on NATO's battlefield nuclear missiles.
   He did not elaborate, but said, ``The overall discussions were
very, very encouraging.''
   On Friday, Bush met here with his top arms-control advisers,
including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft, Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney and Adm. William Crowe, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   Bush was to take Mitterrand to Boston Sunday, where the
president was to give the commencement address at Boston University.
   Later Sunday, the president was expected to stop in Greenwich,
Conn., to see his ailing 87-year-old mother, Dorothy Walker Bush,
recently home from the hospital after suffering an apparent mild
stroke.

<HEAD>Opposition Failure Helps Noriega Buy Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD HERZFELDER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With the help of an opposition that
seems bent on displaying weakness, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega is
buying time to restore his position as de facto ruler of Panama.
   ``He's stringing it along and along and along and along,'' said
one Western analyst. ``Time is on his side.''
   Noriega, whose command of the Panamanian Defense Forces gives
him real power, has outlasted pressure in the past and appeared
stronger for surviving.
   Now he is fighting to recover from the May 7 presidential
election, lost by his own candidate, and from international outrage
brought on by attacks on opposition candidates and the annulment of
the vote.
   Hardball _ physical attacks on the opposition candidates _
appeared to backfire, and Noriega, as he has before, switched
tactics. He lay low and so did his troops.
   The stage was set for the opposition. But it proved, as it has
in the past, that it is not ready for a starring role.
   Despite its election claim that it had support from
three-quarters of the nation, the opposition was unable to put on a
credible display of unity.
   The attack on presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and vice
presidential candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford
caused outrage but also fear, achieving at least part of its
intended effect.
   There were no demonstrations in advance of last Wednesday's stab
at a general strike, even though Noriega could not have afforded
another round of political terror.
   The opposition leadership seemed to prefer following. On the day
of the strike, it asked people to ``use their imaginations.''
   ``People know that we are not using them as cannon fodder, and
that in itself increases support for our movement,'' said Arias
Calderon.
   Unfortunately, that support was invisible on the strike day. Few
stayed away from work, few factories or businesses closed. Even in
opposition strongholds, only a few dozen people went into the
streets.
   Excuses were rife.
   ``This is not Korea, this is not the Philippines,'' said some,
citing two examples where determined street demonstrations put
fatal pressure on autocratic regimes.
   Other excuses included government intimidation, an inability to
communicate because of government media control, or the fact that
Panama's ethnic diversity and class divisions militate against
unity.
   But perhaps one of Noriega's biggest advantages is the mystique
he has developed, even among opponents. Some speak of him almost as
if he were a warlock or a magician, a man who can dodge a speeding
bullet.
   He is said to enjoy crises, to like the pressure of having his
back against the wall. He is said to prefer death to loss of power.
   The opposition _ and the United States _ were reduced to almost
plaintive signals to the Defense Forces that a coup would be
welcome.
   But they have no contacts in the barracks, no way of fomenting
their own plot.
   Noriega, obviously confident despite condemnation of him by the
Organization of American States, began to give interviews and
appeared Thursday at a rally of government supporters.
   He accused the U.S. Embassy of being involved in the May 10
violence that left opposition candidates wounded. He tried to split
U.S. policy-makers by saying the embassy was misinforming Bush.
   An OAS mission to Panama, due this week to encourage a transfer
of power, may actually give Noriega more time by extending talks.
   Last year, after months of violence that followed his indictment
on U.S. drug charges, Noriega also played softball. He ended
harassment of the opposition and of U.S. troops at Panama Canal
installations while negotiations dragged on.
   He used the time to reorganize the government and purge the
Defense Forces. Then, his position consolidated, he suddenly ended
the talks.
   Nevertheless, this year Noriega is weaker. His election defeat
was real and showed one and all how small his base of support is.
   The nucleus of pro-Noriega officers that controls the armed
forces is also small, and no scapegoat for the election defeat has
been found.
   Noriega can no longer be sure he has the support of the
rank-and-file, many of whom apparently voted with the opposition
and must confront the economic difficulties and political
complaints of family and friends.
   Sources in the government report virtual paralysis, with layoffs
planned because revenues are down, in large part due to U.S.
sanctions.
   Finding civilians to run the government is becoming difficult,
despite a show of normality featuring appearances by acting
President Manuel Solis Palma.
   A member of the Panama Canal Commission and the head of Panama's
railroad have resigned.
   Noriega's anti-Yankee jingoism never really caught on, despite
his accusations the drug charges filed against him are part of a
U.S. plot to renege on turning over the Panama Canal at the end of
1999.
   The OAS resolution condemning Noriega, and the withdrawal of
Mexican and Venezuelan ambassadors, were real achievements for
Washington.
   And the opposition, despite its troubles, is unwilling to
compromise because it knows it cannot agree to let Noriega stay in
any form if it wants to govern.
   But Noriega's determination apparently remains firm, and with
the initiative back in his hands he seems to find the whole idea of
stepping down amusing.
   When asked at Thursday's rally how much longer he could hold on,
he laughed and said, ``That's a good question.''

<HEAD>Democratic State Chairmen Grow Restive Over Wright Ethics Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONALD M. ROTHBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democratic Party officials around the country,
while loath to prejudge House Speaker Jim Wright, are becoming
increasingly restive as the case drags on and heads toward the more
intense exposure of a televised ethics committee hearing.
   ``It just does not help the image of the party,'' said North
Carolina Democratic Chairman Lawrence Davis when asked about the
impact in his state of the continuing focus on the speaker's
ethical behavior.
   Davis also distinguished between the legal and political aspects
of the controversy, saying that if the Texas Democrat is not found
guilty of the allegations against him ``who's to say he should step
down?''
   Most politicians _ Republicans as well as Democrats _ said there
was little awareness of the Wright case in their home states.
   A Gallup poll conducted for Times Mirror Co. reported that only
15 percent of people questioned said they were following the ethics
investigation ``very closely.''
   ``It's an inside the (Washington) beltway issue,'' said Nathan
Landow, Maryland Democratic Party chairman.
   ``I don't hear much talk about it,'' said Dwight Adams, South
Dakota Republican Party chairman. ``It's not anywhere near the
scale of the Tower debate,'' he added, referring to the fight over
President Bush's appointment of John Tower to be secretary of
Defense. The Tower nomination was rejected by the Senate.
   On Tuesday, the House ethics committee will hear its special
counsel and lawyers for Wright argue the cases for and against the
allegations concerning the speaker.
   Wright was not expected to appear at the session at which his
lawyers will argue for dismissal of the allegations of 69
violations of House rules.
   That session will be televised. No decision has been made on
whether future committee deliberations also will be televised, but
the fact that the case is starting to get more detailed television
exposure has politicians speculating that public awareness may be
heightened.
   ``At some point television will at least make people aware that
Jim Wright exists and that he's speaker of the House and that
there's a problem,'' said Bonnie Campbell, Iowa Democratic Party
chairman.
   Her Republican counterpart in Iowa, Richard Schwarm, speculated
that television ``might accelerate the process a little bit.
Frankly, the more people learn about it, the more it stinks.''
   ``Television always has some effect,'' said Al LaPierre,
executive director of the Alabama Democratic Party. ``That's when
some folks will really start zeroing in on it.''
   ``The longer it goes on, you don't know what impact it's going
to have,'' said Jim Ruvolo, Ohio Democratic chairman.
   Republicans are split over whether the Wright case could evolve
into a national issue that could hurt all Democrats.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the newly elected Republican
whip, is the leading advocate of trying to raise an abuse of power
issue against the Democrats who have controlled the House for the
past 35 years.
   ``Those Democrats who want to gamble that Jim Wright's little
problems will disappear are welcome to do it,'' Gingrich said in a
recent interview. ``But it's both historically and morally wrong,
and they're both going to find politically it's a disaster.''
   But most House Republicans are shying away from appearing to
pursue Wright with the zeal shown by Gingrich in the past.
   ``It's very delicate right now,'' said Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn.
``Members of the House may be asked to act as jurors. ... The
country should not see Republican members of Congress as a hanging
jury.''
   Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the House GOP campaign committee,
acted intrigued by the possibility at a recent luncheon on Capitol
Hill.
   ``What if, because of the Wright case, because of Coelho, the
Public begins to focus on the powers of incumbency,'' he said,
referring to press reports that have forced Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., chief Democratic vote-counter, to revise his financial
disclosure statement.
   ``What they forget,'' said Ruvolo ``is national issues rarely,
rarely have that much impact on congressional races. What matters
is local issues.''
   ``Jim Wright does not run in North Carolina,'' said Davis.
``It's not reasonable or rational that a Democrat running in North
Carolina would be held accountable for or guilty of any of the
things alleged against Wright.''
   At the same time, he went on, ``It just does not help the image
of the party for an officeholder of that party to have unresolved
allegations made against them that are prominent in public
attention for any length of time.''
   ``I think it hurts the whole Congress,'' said Bruce Benson,
Colorado Republican Party chairman. ``It doesn't just hurt the
Democrats.''
   ``An issue or problem that festers leaves the opportunity for
infection,'' said Landow. ``If it's a wound, the way to take care
of it is to close it as soon as possible to prevent the infection
from spreading.''

   One passenger was killed and 16
others were injured when an express train jumped off the tracks,
the Communist Party daily Rude Pravo said Saturday.
   The likely cause of the accident was the ``changed shape of the
rail due to excessive heat,'' the daily said.
   Czechoslovakia has been experiencing unusually hot weather for
this time of year, with temperatures during the day hovering around
86 degrees.
   Six cars were derailed in the accident, which occurred between

<HEAD>Summary of Allegations Against Speaker in Ethics Case</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Wright-Politics Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas, was charged
April 17 with 69 instances of violating House rules, and new
allegations have since arisen in news reports. Here is a rundown on
the charges:
   BOOK SALES _ The ethics committee charged that on seven
occasions, Wright sold bulk quantities of his book, ``Reflections
of a Public Man,'' to groups to which he had given speeches. It
contends Wright improperly disguised speaking fees, which are
limited under the rules, as book royalties, which are not.
   LEGISLATIVE INTEREST _ The committee charged that Fort Worth
real estate developer George Mallick, by virtue of his extensive
financial holdings, had a direct interest in legislation before
Congress. That would make benefits Wright and his wife received
from Mallick from 1979 to 1988, totaling $145,000, improper under
the rules.
   GIFT REPORTING _ The committee charged that the benefits,
including Mrs. Wright's $18,000-a-year salary from 1979 through
1984, and use of a 1979 Cadillac and a Fort Worth condominium, were
not reported as gifts on Wright's annual financial disclosure form,
as required.
   SABINE LAKE _ Ethics investigators are still looking into
whether Wright received improper proceeds from a 1988 investment in
a Texas gas drilling venture. Known as the Sabine Lake Prospect,
the venture yielded Wright's blind trust a quick $170,000 profit,
even though the well has so far proven dry. Doug Jaffe, a San
Antonio businessman who arranged the investment, is seeking to sell
training aircraft to the Pentagon.
   JEWELL ENTERPRISES _ Wright borrowed $100,000 to invest in a
now-defunct business that bought and sold nursing homes. Although
he ultimately lost his money, at one point he reportedly received
$23,000 in dividends unavailable to other investors, and got help
paying the interest on his loan. The ethics panel still is
examining the transactions.
   PACIFIC INSTITUTE _ Former employees of a Seattle, Wash., firm
that sells motivational programs say Wright's wife Betty did little
or no work for the $36,000 salary she received from 1985 to 1988.
Her boss at the time insists she performed satisfactorily. Wright
used the Congressional Record to print a glowing endorsement of a
videotape his wife had helped produce for the firm. The ethics
panel is believed to be taking a look at these charges, as well.

   President Bush's call for $1.2 billion to beef
up federal law enforcement to fight crime is likely to get quickly
mired in the perennial budget battle on Capitol Hill.
   Bush unveiled his plan to ``take back the streets'' from violent
criminals just five days after his budget director told Congress
the administration opposed spending more money on the drug war this
year.
   Democrats were quick last week to point out what they called a
contradiction in Bush's position.
   Besides new death penalty provisions and stiffer sentences for
firearms use, Bush's plan calls for adding 24,000 cells to the
federal prison system, hiring 825 agents and staff for U.S. law
enforcement agencies and hiring 1,600 new Justice Department
prosecutors.
   Administration officials said the $1.2 billion to pay for the
program next year could come from a discretionary fund set aside in
the bipartisan budget agreement negotiated with Congress.
   But Democrats in Congress who want to first spend money to
finance programs enacted in last year's drug bill are ready to
battle Bush on the issue.
   Democrats are anxious to demonstrate to the voters that they,
not Bush, are willing to spend what they say it takes to fight the
drug war. At the same time there is pressure to keep spending
within agreed-upon limits to reduce the federal deficit.
   The drug law authorized $2.6 million in enforcement and
drug-treatment programs but only $500 million was actually
appropriated.
   An $822 million spending package proposed by House Democrats to
finance many of the enforcement programs in drug law was already a
point of controversy between Congress and the White House when Bush
made his proposal last Monday.
   ``The president hasn't said how we are to pay for his new
anti-crime package,'' Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, noted in a statement after Bush
spelled out his plan in speech to a law enforcement group on the
steps of the Capitol.
   ``At the same time, he is asking for more than $1 billion in new
programs, his budget director is telling Congress his adminstration
opposes the new funds to pay for the 1988 drug bill.
   ``We need to make tough, tough choices how to pay for these
programs,'' Biden said.
   The object of Biden's ire was a May 10 letter that Budget
Director Richard G. Darman wrote to Rep. Jamie Whitten, D-Miss.,
chairman of the House Appropriations Committee opposing the $822
million Democrats want to earmark for anti-drug efforts this year.
   ``Important though the drug problem is,'' Darman wrote, ``it is
also important that we attend to the urgent need for a restoration
of fiscal discipline.''
   Darman called drug issue an ``undesirable complication'' in
efforts to agree to an urgent supplemental appropriation that is
pending in the House. The emergency appropriation for the drug war
is scheduled to be debated Wednesday by the House.
   In his letter, the budget director urged Congress not to
appropriate any more money this year until drug czar William
Bennett makes his recommendations for a national drug strategy.
   Bennett, whose office was created in last year's drug
legislation, is expected to issue is report in September.
   But congressional aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, say
the Democratic leadership is ready to press the issue before
Bennett completes his report.
   Half of the $822 million is intended speed up procurement of
equipment by law enforcement agencies, such as surveillance planes
used to spot drug smugglers.
   Biden said he may propose an excise tax on cigarettes, liquor,
wine and beer to raise money for the drug fight. The excise-tax
proposal that proposal that Biden and Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H.,
proposed last year to raise $900 million for the drug war was
defeated in the Senate.
   Debate over Biden's excise tax could come when the Senate
considers the $822 million in the urgent supplemental appropriation.

<TEXT>
   Every decade or so the Western world frets
over what is perceived as the impending dissolution of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. But Mikhail S. Gorbachev was not
around for those earlier episodes.
   Like his predecessors, the Soviet leader has thrown fuel on the
smoldering fire of NATO discord. Unlike his predecessors, Gorbachev
has taken concrete steps toward what he tells the Europeans is his
vision of ``our common home,'' a continent undivided and secure.
   The 16-nation alliance is moving toward its May 29 meeting in
Brussels feeling the heat of disagreement between West Germany on
the one hand and the United States and Britain on the other over
negotiating with the Soviets on reductions or elimination of
short-range nuclear weapons.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whose coalition faces a
tough election next year, is pushing hard for NATO to negotiate but
the Bush administration is holding back.
   The issue may seem minor in the face of such arms control
accomplishments as the 1987 treaty to eliminate intermediate-range
nuclear missiles and progress in talks to radically cut the
superpower strategic and conventional forces.
   But there are fundamental disagreements among the Western allies
and the current problem can be blamed in part _ but only in part _
on skillful exploitation of those differences by the Soviets.
   Gorbachev has played the good guy, offering visions of a
undivided Europe free of nuclear threat.
   His foreign minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, has played the
heavy, threatening to halt destruction of SS-23 missiles and
thereby violate the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Force Treaty that
was the focal point of the U.S.-Soviet summits of December 1987 and
June 1988.
   Two other major factors are at work in the current NATO discord.
   One is the style, or lack thereof, the Bush administration
displays in dealing with the Soviets, symbolized by White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater's description of Gorbachev as a
``drugstore cowboy.''
   The other is more substantive: the fundamental difference
between the United States and its European allies over NATO nuclear
doctrine, specifically the so-called ``flexible response'' that
envisions the first use of atomic weapons by the West to repel an
invasion by superior Soviet conventional forces.
   ``The United States and Western Europe have different
strategies,'' said Paul Warnke, who was arms control negotiator
under President Carter. ``The United States wants to keep the war
in Europe. The Europeans want the United States and the Soviet
Union to blow each other up'' and keep the nuclear warheads from
falling on Europe.
   Gorbachev has capitulated in principle to Western demands to
radically reduce conventional armies in Europe, agreeing to
eliminate far more Warsaw Pact weapons and forces than he would
require of NATO and thereby bringing the opposing alliances into
rough numerical parity.
   But many details remain to be negotiated, and until then, NATO
must rely on flexible response.
   That doctrine has made Western political elites secure because
it deters Soviet aggression. But every time voters in European
democracies take a close look at it, they view the doctrine as
fundamentally terrifying, said Richard K. Betts, a NATO specialist
at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
   ``Periodically we get hysterical,'' he said. ``We tend to forget
that we have had these wrangles within the alliance in the past.
What is different this time is Gorbachev. He is playing some cards
that we have not faced on the other side of the table before.''
   While depicting Gorbachev as a ``drugstore cowboy'' was not the
way to win friends and influence people in the Kremlin, it does
focus attention on the style of the Soviet leader.
   Gorbachev and his aides ``often make sweeping promises without
conducting a policy review,'' said Dmitri Simes, an emigre Soviet
analyst who works at the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in Washington.
   For example, Simes said, ``the Soviets announced a 14.2 percent
cut in the defense budget, but they do not yet know what the
defense budget is.''
   ``They announced a 500,000 cut in the size of the Soviet Armed
Forces, and then sat back and watched the front pages. It was only
under pressure from Congress, from the administration and from the
Western press that they began to figure out what they wanted to
cut,'' Simes told the congressional Commission on Security and
Cooperation in Europe.

   Police beat 45 students today as citizens
demanding democratic reform and the resignation of Premier Li Peng
poured into Tiananmen Square by the thousands to defy a martial law
decree.
   In the most violent confrontation since pro-democracy
demonstrations began nearly five weeks ago, students said about 150
armed police attacked students with electric cattle prods on a road
in western Beijing.
   Zhu Bin, a student at the Beijing No. 2 Languages Institute,
said the students were blocking 20 military troop trucks from
advancing down the road when police appeared.
   ``They attacked the girls first. We tried to protect them and
they hit us too,'' he said. Zhu, showing bruises on his shoulder,
said 45 were hospitalized.
   ``Down with martial law!'' became the new rallying cry as
students called for the resignation of Li. Supporters of the
students arrived by bicycle, in the back of flatbed trucks and on
foot.
   Later today, 3,000 students on the square who had been on a
hunger strike, some for as long as a week, decided to abandon their
fast to conserve their strength for the struggle ahead, student
leaders said.
   Army troops moved into the capital late Friday and early today
but were stopped by thousands of citizens who clogged the roads,
climbed over their trucks and pleaded with them not to attack.
   ``We are people and you are people! Why do you have no
feelings?'' one demonstrator shouted at the troopers.
   Military helicopters made repeated low runs over the city, a
rare sight in this city of 10 million residents.
   Three tanks just south of the square were being blocked by buses
deliberately placed across the road today by protesters.
   As the day drew to a close, hundreds of thousands of people
remained in control of central Beijing and few soldiers were seen.
   Protests also have been reported in at least 20 other cities,
including Shanghai, China's largest city with 12 million residents.
   In Shanghai, more than 300,000 people rallied on the waterfront
of the Huangpu River and another 200,000 gathered in the city's
People's Square. Many carried banners demanding Li's resignation,
but the police presence was minimal, and there were no reports of
violence.
   ``You've got millions of soldiers _ we've got 1.1 billion
people,'' read one banner.
   The Bush administration late Friday urged China to use restraint
in dealing with the demonstrators and called a government
announcment of a news blackout ``disturbing.''
   Britain today expressed concern at China's imposition of martial
law in Beijing and urged the Chinese government and demostrators to
exercise ``restraint and moderation.''
   The Netherlands canceled a May 24-30 visit to China by Queen
Beatrix. Critics of the planned visit had warned her safety could
not be ensured and said the trip would be seen as a token of
support for China's rulers.
   Martial law took effect this morning in eight districts of the
capital, China Central Television said.
   The zone included Tiananmen Square, the symbolic center of
China, where hundreds of thousands of protesters have been encamped
the past week.
   ``Tiananmen is supposed to be under martial law, but it's under
student law,'' said a woman enrolled at Northern Communication
College.
   The regulations included strict limits on the activities of
foreign reporters and photographers covering the protests, and U.S.
television networks were ordered to halt transmissions from
Beijing. Normal transmission wires of The Associated Press were cut
for several hours this morning.
   The crisis over China's most serious popular unrest in 40 years
of communist rule also led to the resignation of Communist Party
General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, a reformer who pushed for compromise
with the students, Chinese sources said.
   One Asian diplomat said it appeared likely that Qiao Shi, a
member of the power-wielding Politburo Standing Committee with a
background in public security, would be named to succeed Zhao.
   Li announced the crackdown in a meeting at the Great Hall of the
People.
   It was the first time martial law was declared in Beijing since
communist China was founded in 1949.
   Beijing becomes the second city under martial law. Lhasa,
capital of Tibet, has been under martial law since March after
anti-Chinese riots.
   Beijing university students began protesting for democracy on
April 15, after former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang died. Hu
was ousted in 1987 for failing to crack down on earlier student
dmonstrations.
   Although students have been the catalyst for the protests, they
have evolved into broad-based demonstrations.
   The official Xinhua News Agency said Li signed the martial law
order to end ``serious turmoil ... (that) destroyed people's life
and social order.''
   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong signed measures forbidding marches,
strikes, class boycotts, distribution of pamphlets, spreading
rumors, attacks on leaders and media outlets and ``any other
destructive actions.''
   In a separate order, he said foreign reporters were forbidden to
``incite or instigate Chinese to to march'' and could not conduct
interviews or make videos on the streets or at government offices,
schools, factories and mines.
   Li also said a ``very few people ... concentrate their attack on
comrade Deng Xiaoping, who has made great contributions to China's
opening to the outside world.''
   Deng, 84, is widely admired for initiating market-oriented
reforms but has come under sharp attack by students for holding on
to power too long and letting political reform lag behind economic
reforms.

   President Najib said Saturday he will
appoint a commission to talk peace with Moslem guerrillas but
warned his troops are ready to ``inflict smashing rocket blows'' to
defeat the rebels.
   The guerrillas claimed to have killed at least 10 government
soldiers and shot down a Soviet-built jet in recent fighting.
   Najib said the three-member commission would negotiate with
rebels anywhere and at any time.
   ``This is the best proposal we can make, and what more can I do
for an opposition that claims to hold 95 percent of the country?''
Najib said in a speech to the opening session of the Loya Jirgah,
which is empowered to decide matters affecting the country's future.
   Members include the vice president, prime minister and his
deputies, the Cabinet, and National Assembly members.
   Najib said the commission would be selected by the Loya Jirgah
and would talk to guerrilla commanders inside Afghanistan and to
rebel leaders in neighboring Pakistan and Iran.
   The Loya Jirgah was called into session primarily to extend by
three months a nationwide state of emergency, which was declared
Feb. 18, three days after the last Soviet troops left Afghanistan.
   The Red Army had been in Afghanistan for nine years to back
Najib's troops in their war with the guerrillas, who are supported
by the United States and Pakistan and are based in Pakistan. They
are fighting to topple the communist government and declare an
Islamic republic.
   ``The republic of Afghanistan, by making use of its legitimate
and undeniable right for the defense of its independence and
territorial integrity, will infict smashing rocket blows on the
Afghan armed extremists in Pakistan. There should be no doubts in
this regard,'' Najib said.
   The president added that he would order a full mobilization to
defeat the guerrillas, suggesting every male could be called for
military service.
   He also said he would draw on all available assistance from
Moscow, which continues to airlift food and weapons into Kabul.
   In Pakistan, the guerrillas' Afghan News Agency said 10 Afghan
soldiers were killed and at least 20 were wounded Thursday in a
rebel attack on the city of Jalalabad. The report made no mention
of guerrilla casualties.
   Afghanistan's official Radio Kabul, monitored in Islamabad,
claimed only one soldier died but that 153 rebels were killed.
   The guerrilla news agency said rebels also attacked the military
airport of the southeastern city of Kandahar on Thursday, wounding
11 Afghan soldiers and shooting down a Soviet-built Mig-21 jet
fighter.

<TEXT>
   A Hollywood murder mystery which has been the
subject of movieland gossip for six years is unraveling at last in
court, and the characters could have stepped out of a writer's
imagination.
   In fact, a number of well-known wordsmiths are planning books
and articles based on the tale of greed and glitter that led
producer Robert Evans to invoke the 5th Amendment when asked to
testify about the murder of theatrical producer Roy Radin.
   Evans, the former head of production at Paramount Pictures, was
only one of the colorful witnesses who drew authors, magazine
writers and a cadre of celebrity watchers to the courtroom of
Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay on opening day of a preliminary
hearing last week.
   Author and magazine writer Dominick Dunne was there for ``Vanity
Fair.'' So were writers Steve Wicks and Michael Fessier Jr., who
plan books on the case. A Hollywood entertainment company announced
it had already optioned the story for a TV movie-of-the-week.
   The hearing, now entering its second week, will determine
whether a woman who was a reputed drug dealer and Evans associate
should stand trial along with two former bodyguards of ``Hustler''
Magazine publisher Larry Flynt in the ``Cotton Club Murder Case.''
A fourth defendant, also a former bodyguard of Flynt's, is fighting
extradition from Maryland.
   The first witness, who had ties to drugs and Flynt's security
network, implicated all of the defendants in the killing of Radin,
33, a corpulent, cocaine-sniffing impresario. Police reports
indicate that other witnesses will implicate Evans.
   Evans, now working on a sequel to his movie ``Chinatown,'' was
called as the first witness last week but refused to testify on
grounds that he might incriminate himself. Tanned and tense, Evans
sat nervously on the witness stand while his attorney won the
battle for him not to testify. Evans refused to say even whether he
knew Radin.
   The case might have been invented by a Hollywood scenario
writer. It has links to the secret deals of movie power brokers,
the underworld of Colombian drug dealers and Flynt's lurid porno
publishing empire. Key figures in the drama are Evans; actor Demond
Wilson, the former star of TV's ``Sanford And Son''; and William
Ryder, Flynt's former brother-in-law.
   The slaying of Radin became known as ``The Cotton Club Murder''
because it dates back to 1983 when Evans, a top Hollywood producer,
was negotiating with Radin, a flamboyant New Yorker, to raise
millions for the movie about a Harlem nightspot of the 1920s and
'30s.
   A woman known as Elaine ``Laynie'' Jacobs had introduced the two
men. That same woman, said to have ties to the Colombian cocaine
network of Carlos Lehder, is really Karen DeLayne Greenberger, now
charged in the Radin murder. Charged along with her are Alex Lamota
Marti, William Molony Mentzer and Robert Ulmer Lowe, the former
Flynt bodyguards. Lowe is fighting extradition.
   When Radin disappeared in May 1983, he was en route to dinner
with Mrs. Greenberger at the fashionable La Scala restaurant in
Beverly Hills. The two had been quarreling over her demand for a
share of the profits from Evans' movie. But there were other
problems. She had accused Radin of stealing $1 million in cash and
cocaine from her garage.
   A month after he was seen stepping into a limousine with Mrs.
Greenberger, Radin's body was found in a dry riverbed near Gorman
about 65 miles north of Los Angeles. He had been shot repeatedly in
the head.
   His death made headlines, but until last year no one was charged
with the murder. Then Ryder came forward and said he had new
information. Authorities ``wired'' him with tape-recording devices
and sent him to gather evidence.
   Since charges were filed last October, Ryder has been a
protected witness. He is expected to testify this week along with
Radin's former secretary, Jonathan Lawson, and Wilson. Wilson,
whose career was being managed by Radin, has said the doomed
producer feared for his life and wanted Wilson to follow him to La
Scala. Wilson lost the car in traffic when the driver ran a red
light, according to his earlier account.
   Most of those details were corroborated last week by Carl Plzak,
the first witness to link the defendants to the crime. Plzak, a
body builder and sometime Flynt bodyguard, received immunity from
prosecution in the Radin murder for his testimony. He said he heard
the others make plans to ``grab a fat pig and take him to the
desert.'' Later, he said, they told him about the murder.
   Plzak's motives have been attacked by the battery of defense
attorneys who were to conclude his cross-examination Monday. They
portrayed him as a drug user and dealer with a conviction record
and suggested he would say anything to avoid serving jail time. He
adamantly declared he was telling the truth.

   A man shot and killed four children, then
used the gun to kill himself at a house on the city's north side
this morning, police said.
   Police tactical unit officers found the body of John Dubbin, 31,
and the bodies of the children, ranging in age from 1 to 7, in the
house around 11:20 a.m., said Lt. Dick Morgan, commander of the
SWAT unit. The man's wife, who told police he had been acting
strangely before the shootings, was unhurt.
   The unit was called to the house about four hours earlier.
   Morgan said the man's wife told police that Dubbin had been
acting paranoid and fired a shotgun in the house around 5 a.m. She
said she was sent out to buy cigarettes and called police when she
returned and found she had been locked out.
   Morgan said officers decided to storm the house after efforts to
communicate with the occupants failed.
   ``We even knocked a window out and threw a phone in there to try
to get him to come to the phone,'' he said.
   He said that when there was no answer, he ordered tear gas put
into the house. When there was still no response from anyone
inside, the SWAT team went in and found men and the children, all
shot. A dog inside the house attacked officers when they entered
the house and was shot.

<HEAD>Burmese Troops Pursuing Rebels Clash With Thai Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAE SOT, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 500 Burmese troops clashed with
Thai soldiers on Saturday after crossing the border to attack a
Karen rebel stronghold, a Thai officer said.
   The officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hills in
Burma fired heavy shells on the Kaw Moo Ra stronghold, setting much
of it ablaze in the third straight day of heavy fighting.
   About 1,200 guerrillas were defending the camp against 3,000
soldiers, said the officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The camp is just across the Moei River separating Burma's Karen
State and the Mae Sot district of Thailand's northern province of
Tak.
   The officer said 400 soldiers crossed into Mae Sot's Ban
Wangkaew village, which has been evacuated due to the fighting, to
set up artillery to shell the camp. Some also seized control of a
road about five miles from Mae Sot, the officer said.
   Thai forces fired heavy rounds into the village, and the Burmese
soldiers later moved to another area inside Thailand, said the
officer.
   He said Thai forces fired artillery rounds to warn another 100
Burmese soldiers who crossed into another area of Mae Sot.
   No soldiers were reported hurt in the clashes, but a 64-year-old
man was wounded by shrapnel from shells that strayed into Mae Sot
from Burma.
   ``They (the Burmese soldiers) are attacking across the river and
fighting us from the Thai side,'' said a Karen official who
demanded anonymity.
   He said the offensive against the rebels was the largest since
1977 and that thousands of Karen civilians had fled to Thailand.
   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, who have
been fighting for four decades for greater autonomy.
   But the trade-oriented Bangkok government has sent senior
officials to Burma to discuss the situation and has repatriated
hundreds of Burmese students who had been fighting alongside the
rebels.
   These actions broke the international isolation of the military
government in Rangoon, which last year killed hundreds of people
while putting down widespread, pro-democracy demonstrations led by
students.
   Government forces began shelling the Kaw Moo Ra stronghold
Thursday, two days after overrunning the major rebel base of
Wangkha, two miles to the south.
   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold along the Thai frontier
to be captured since the government launched an offensive in
October.
   A government spokesman said in Rangoon that at least 43 rebels
and 35 soldiers were killed in the battle for Wangkha.
   With an estimated 4,000 combatants, the Karen National Union is
the largest of 10 ethnic insurgent groups joined in the National
Democratic Front.
   The Karens began their revolt in 1949, the year after Burma
achieved independence from Britain. The rebels said at the time
that the government reneged on its promise of more autonomy for
ethnic minorities.

   Comedian Gilda Radner, who created Roseanne
Roseannadanna, Emily Litella and a brace of other goofy characters
as part of the original cast of ``Saturday Night Live,'' died early
today of cancer, a hospital official said. She was 42.
   Miss Radner, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer about 2{
years ago, died in her sleep about 6:20 a.m. at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center, said hospital spokesman Ron Wise. Her husband of
five years, actor-filmmaker Gene Wilder, was at her side.
   On ``Saturday Night Live,'' which premiered on NBC in 1975, Miss
Radner gave life to such characters as the scatterbrained
broadcaster Ms. Roseannadanna, whose catch phrase, ``It's always
something,'' became the title of a book she wrote detailing her
fight with cancer.
   ``I loved her like a sister,'' grieving fellow ``Saturday
Night'' star Dan Aykroyd said in comments relayed by spokeswoman
Susan Patricola. ``My thoughts are with Gene and her family.''
   Besides the nasal-voiced TV news commentator, she also created
the Baba Wawa character, a spoof of news interviewer Barbara
Walters, as well as the nerdy teen-ager Lisa Lubner and the dowdy
Ms. Litella, who delivered misguided opinion pieces on such things
as ``violins on television,'' backing off a sweet ``Never
mi-i-i-i-ind'' when her error was pointed out.
   Miss Radner was rewarded with an Emmy Award for outstanding
performance by an actress in a variety series.
   Born in Detroit, Miss Radner began her professional career in
the Toronto Company of ``Godspell,'' then became a member of the
Toronto company of ``Second City,'' the improvisational group that
also gave Aykroyd his start.
   She was a writer and performer for the New York-based ``National
Lampoon Radio Hour'' and its stage counterpart, the ``National
Lampoon Show,'' in the early 1970s and in 1975 was selected for the
original cast of ``Saturday Night Live.''
   While working on ``Saturday Night Live,'' she also showed her
comic abilities on Broadway in 1979 with ``Gilda Live.'' It was
later produced as a movie and then an album, ``Live From New York
Gilda Radner.''
   After ``Saturday Night Live'' she appeared in several films,
including ``First Family,'' ``The Woman in Red,'' a 1984 hit
written and directed by her co-star, Wilder; as well as ``Haunted
Honeymoon,'' ``Hanky Panky'' and ``It Came From Hollywood.''
   She also starred in the Broadway play ``Lunch Hour'' with Sam
Waterson, in 1980.
   As an author she wrote a book of humor, ``Roseanne
Roseannadana's `Hey, Get Back to Work' Book.'' An autobiographical
account of her battle with cancer, ``It's Always Something,'' was
due to be published next month.
   Miss Radner entered Cedars-Sinai on Wednesday, hospital
spokesman Wise said.
   She had been diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 1986 and underwent
nine months of chemotherapy. She also had radiation therapy and
other treatments, including surgery as recently as February.
   The treatments sent the disease into temporary remission and the
comedian told a Life magazine interviewer in 1988 that ``cancer is
about the most unfunny thing in the world. But it doesn't mean you
have to die.''
   ``In fact,'' she told the magazine with a defiant edge to her
voice, ``I think I've never been as healthy and as well as I am
now.''
   Wise said funeral services will be private.

   The police department's crime prevention
officer was accused of stealing about $4,800 in cash seized by the
department as evidence.
   Ian Chaplin, 36, a five-year veteran of the Covington Police
Department, was charged with theft after a month-long
investigation, Police Chief Al Strain said Friday.
   Chaplin had the only key to the evidence room and was the only
person with access to anything in it, Strain said. The chief
suspended Chaplin on Friday and then turned on the department's
findings to the district attorney's office, which filed charges.
   The officer resigned Friday afternoon, and the district
attorney's office arrested him two hours later. He was released
Friday night on $10,000 property bond.

   South Korean workers have received
wage increases averaging 17.3 percent so far this year, and more
than 80 percent of labor disputes have been settled, officials said
Saturday.
   The Economic Planning Board warned, however, that the increases
would push consumer prices up 5 percent and make South Korean
exports less competitive abroad.
   The board said the nation's labor disputes, which cost almost $4
billion in lost production, were nearing an end. It said 81.2
percent, or 756 of 931 disputes, had been settled, and that the
rest were expected to be settled soon.
   The wage increases, given by 1,813 companies with more than 100
employees each, were 4.8 percentage points higher on average than
those awarded during the same period last year, the board said.

   Leona Tennyson is known as ``the Betsy Ross
of the Prairie'' for her work in assembling the world's largest
quilt. Now, like the original Betsy Ross, she has a fight on her
hands: State officials want to take apart her labor of love.
   ``I will never allow it to be dismantled. I will fight to the
end for that,'' declared Tennyson, a 74-year-old ranch owner and
insurance saleswoman.
   The quilt is shaped like North Dakota and features intricate
details of each of the state's 53 counties and 1,358 townships. It
weighs 800 pounds and measures 85 by 134 feet, 1{ times as long and
wide as a basketball court. Twenty-five to 40 people are needed to
carry it.
   But Tennyson's pride and joy now sits in a heap, stuffed with
mothballs and covered with plastic, in a storage room at Minot
State University's athletic complex. Critics call it a white
elephant, and they say Tennyson is too stubborn to admit it.
   The state Historical Board, which oversees items placed in the
state museum in Bismarck, refused to accept the quilt for display,
saying it was not a historical artifact. The board recommended it
be dismantled so each county could be given its particular section
_ a proposal that angered Tennyson.
   ``It is too beautiful of a piece of work to be torn apart,'' she
said. ``The sections fit together just like sections of land on the
ground.''
   The state Centennial Commission, which gave Tennyson about
$10,000 in expense money for the project, has appointed a special
committee to find a solution to the quilt quandary.
   State Tourism Director Jim Fuglie, a member of the panel, says
he ``pooh-poohed'' the quilt until he walked on it, tracing a path
from his hometown of Hettinger to Bismarck.
   ``Just the incredible calculation to make it fit to scale is
phenomenal,'' Fuglie said. ``My instincts are not to dismantle it.
... I think there is a way to display it. We just haven't found
it.''
   Tennyson, a rusty-haired great-grandmother, lives alone in a
modest home in this town of 100 people just two miles south of the
Canadian border.
   She recently bought a van to haul the quilt to events during the
state's 100th birthday celebration this summer. She probably will
charge $1 to see it, she said.
   State officials rallied around Tennyson when she struggled to
make her quilt the world's largest _ especially when she had to
enlarge it at the last minute to surpass a quilt in Australia.
   Gov. George Sinner held a news conference to promote the
project, and the quilt was displayed on the state Capitol grounds,
as well as in Fargo's civic auditorium.
   The Guinness Book of World Records certified the quilt last July
as the world's largest. A quilt that was assembled in San Francisco
to memorialize AIDS victims was many times larger, but its panels
were laid side by side, not actually sewn together.
   Former Gov. Arthur Link, chairman of the Centennial Commission,
said the dispute over the quilt involves some basic questions _ who
owns it and what possible use could be found for it.
   One solution would be to put it on a huge roller, ``sort of like
an endless towel,'' Link suggested. Another idea is to store the
quilt in an air-tight container and use pictures to explain it.
   Tennyson coordinated the Citizens Centennial Quilt Committee,
which used 7,000 volunteers to cut and assemble the pieces that
eventually became the quilt. Volunteers in each township and county
were responsible for their own sections, and the 53 completed
county sections were sent to Tennyson in Antler, where she and some
local volunteers sewed together the completed quilt.
   ``Some feel she got paid for it so it isn't hers. ... She's very
set in her ways,'' said bartender Madonna Eide in Antler, where
Tennyson and her quilt are a popular conversation piece.
   But letters Tennyson receives from people across the state _ one
woman suggested each resident of the state donate $1 to construct a
building for the blanket _ convince her that the quilt should never
be dismantled.
   ``I don't think you call that being stubborn. You are just
standing up for your rights,'' she said, smiling.
   North Dakotans should be proud they sewed the world's largest
quilt, the seamstress said.
   ``They (officials) have to sign papers that that quilt will not
be taken apart before I turn it over (to them),'' she said.
   ``That's my baby.''

   Donald Hiss, who with his brother Alger
was accused of being part of a Washington espionage ring in the
1940s, has died of lung cancer. He was 82.
   Hiss died Thursday at his home here.
   Hiss retired 13 years ago from the Washington law firm of
Covington &amp; Burling, which he joined in 1945 after holding posts in
the federal government.
   In 1948, Donald and Alger Hiss were identified as spies by
Whittaker Chambers, a Time magazine senior editor and admitted
former Communist, in testimony before the House Un-American
Activities Committee.
   Donald Hiss, who denied the allegations, was not prosecuted.
Alger Hiss was convicted of perjury and has devoted much of his
life to unsuccessful efforts to overturn that judgment.
   Donald Hiss, a native of Baltimore, graduated from Johns Hopkins
University. He received a law degree from the Harvard Law School in
1932 and served for a year as secretary to Supreme Court Justice
Oliver Wendell Holmes.
   Hiss joined the New Deal administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt
in 1933 as a lawyer in the solicitor's office of the Department of
Labor and later served in the Department of State's Office of
Philippine Affairs.
   During World War II, Donald Hiss was an assistant to Dean
Acheson, then assistant secretary of state in charge of economic
affairs and later secretary of state.
   After his retirement, he moved to this town on Maryland's
Eastern Shore.
   In addition to his brother, he is survived by his wife, the
former Catherine G. Jones; a son; two daughters; and three
grandchildren.
   A private service was to be held Saturday.

   U.S. officials who hatched the
Iran-Contra arms deal took advantage of the United States' good
relations with Honduras, the former head of the Honduran military
says.
   But retired Gen. Walter Lopez Reyes said he has no knowledge
that President Bush was involved in any deal through which Honduras
would receive aid in exchange for supporting covert aid to the
Nicaraguan rebels.
   Lopez was armed forces chief from April 1984 to February 1986,
which covered the period during which U.S. officials reputedly sold
arms to Iran in exchange for aid to the Nicaraguan Contras.
   Lopez was critical of the 1985 U.S. program to give Nicaraguan
rebels covert lethal aid and of the man who ran it, Oliver North,
   ``I always saw how it was going to affect Honduras, because of
how it (the plan) was conceived,'' he said. ``It was done behind
the back of Congress, behind the back of the general public, lying
publicly.
   Congress banned military aid to the Contras during part of the
time Lopez was in office.
   The aid scheme has raised questions about whether Bush, vice
president at the time, was involved. North, an ex-National Security
Council aide, was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an
obstruction of Congress, altering and destroying classified
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   The controversy over the aid and alleged political arrangements
has touched not only Bush, but Lopez and Roberto Suazo Cordova,
Honduran president from 1982 to 1986.
   Lopez, a 46-year-old career officer whose early retirement was
considered by some Hondurans to be a result of U.S. pressure, won't
name names.
   He says he is writing a book in which ``everything will come
out.'' He said he also fears retribution, but won't elaborate.
   In a recent interview at his modest appliance store, Lopez spoke
with some bitterness about what he called the ``atrocious policy''
in Honduras of ``the North group.''
   He declined to be specific about who was in ``the North group,''
but said, ``They came down here like entrepreneurs ... buying
favors, buying consciences.''
   Lopez in October 1985 seized a planeload of war materiel meant
for the Contras and returned it to Miami. He apparently was upset
that Mario Calero, brother of Contra directorate member Adolfo
Calero, showed up in the plane with two television camera crews.
   ``When I was told of this, I ordered that they should not leave
the plane,'' Lopez said. ``Then I told President Suazo that it
should be returned to Miami.''
   Suazo ordered the shipment sent back.
   ``The (North) group tried to influence us into letting it go,''
Lopez said. ``But that was covert aid, and they wanted us to leave
it alone.''
   The New York Times last week reported a December 1985 memo from
North to John M. Poindexter, his then-boss on the National Security
Council, who was about to visit Honduras and meet with Lopez.
   ``From previous meetings with Lopez, it is obvious that the
Hondurans perceive the U.S.G. (United States Government) is using
Honduras for its own political ends. They have learned that we
withhold our assistance ... in order to force concessions from
them. They are now using this same tactic with us as a means of
insuring that the U.S.G. will come through for them.
   ``Lopez and his colonels realize that the only leverage they
have over us is their covert support for the Nicaraguan
resistance,'' the North memo said, according to the New York Times
report.
   Evidence at the North trial showed President Reagan approved a
plan in February 1985 whereby Honduras would receive increased aid
in exchange for its cooperation with the covert Contra aid. The
plan was to be conveyed to Suazo through an emissary.
   Bush has denied making the offer when he visited Suazo's home in
La Paz, north of Tegucigalpa. Lopez said he knew of no such deal.
   ``I was at the La Paz meeting, but there are moments when
presidents want to meet alone,'' Lopez said. ``And later I can't
say to a president `What did you talk about?'''
   Suazo did not reply to interview requests from The Associated
Press, but he denied such a deal in April.
   ``I never negotiated our national sovereignty in that manner,''
he said.
   After the March 1985 visit by Bush, Suazo traveled to Washington
that May to sign a $110 million credit package for Honduras. The
money was meant to help Honduras with its balance of payments
deficit.
   Suazo said his government received $35 million of that package.
The money stopped flowing after the plane seizure episode by Lopez.
Suazo said his successor, current President Jose Azcona Hoyo,
received the balance, $75 million.
   Azcona's government also denies any tradeoff with Washington
over the Contra aid. ``Honduras has not received any aid beyond
what is publicly known,'' said presidential spokesman Marco Tulio
Romero.

<TEXT>
   Coast Guard personnel ceased physically
plotting the movement of ships outside Valdez Narrows _ including
the area where the Exxon Valdez ran aground _ after staff cuts in
1977, the Coast Guard commander in Valdez testified Saturday.
   But Cmdr. Steven McCall told federal investigators the change
``in no way reduced the vigilance'' of ship traffic monitors in
Valdez.
   McCall made his statements on the fifth and final day of a
National Transportation Safety Board hearing on the March 24 crash
of the 987-foot Exxon tanker in Prince William Sound.
   The Coast Guard's ability to monitor traffic in the sound has
come under scrutiny since the accident in which the ship spilled
nearly 11 million gallons of North Slope crude oil, the nation's
worst spill.
   NTSB officials, who heard earlier last week from representatives
of Exxon, some crew members on the tanker, state officials and
others, have said that they won't complete their report into the
cause of the spill for several months.
   McCall said a new radar system has functions that make it
unnecessary to physically plot ship movements.
   Ship monitors testified last week that they could not see the
Exxon tanker on radar in the minutes before it ran aground, and had
no indication it was in trouble.
   McCall said the radar system has a range of up to 20 miles, but
the range varies with the weather.
   ``It's well within the realm of possibility that (the monitor)
could have lost a reliable fix'' the night of the accident, he said.
   McCall also said the Exxon Valdez did not have the Coast Guard's
permission to leave normal traffic lanes. Members of the ship's
crew have said it left the lanes to avoid ice.
   In other testimony Saturday, McCall said there was no reason for
him to take over response to the Exxon oil spill soon after it
happened, because resources to deal with the spill weren't on hand.
   ``There was no benefit to be derived from me taking it over,''
he said. Response immediately after the tanker crash was handled by
Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., an industry consortium that manages
the trans-Alaska oil pipeline and Valdez marine terminal.
   McCall said that the use of oil-dispersing chemicals was
discussed soon after the accident occurred early the morning of
Good Friday. Tests of dispersant were conducted late that afternoon
or early in the evening, he said, adding that he does not believe
there was an unreasonable delay in carrying out those tests to
determine the dispersants' likely effectiveness.
   ``It took time for the dispersant-spraying equipment to arrive
at the terminal,'' McCall said, and when it did arrive, there were
``repairs or add-on equipment'' to deal with.
   McCall also told investigators Alyeska had in stock less
dispersant than would have been needed to significantly reduce
damage caused by the spill of nearly 11 million gallons of North
Slope crude oil.
   In the test, ``there appeared to be no positive effect'' from
the dispersant, he said, possibly because of the thickness of oil
on the water.
   ``It was still pretty thick,'' he said.
   The use of dispersants has been a continuing controversy in
evaluations of response to the spill, which has stained more than
700 miles of south-central Alaska shores and killed hundreds of
birds and marine mammals.
   Exxon has said the oil would not have spread to devastating
proportions if state officials had promptly granted permission for
the use of dispersant. Dennis Kelso, state commissioner of
environmental conservation, has said that the state did not stand
in the way of chemical usage, and that Alyeska did not have enough
dispersant to do the job.

   As Vice President Dan Quayle wound
his way through his first five months in office, a pair of former
stockbrokers decided he should have some time on his hands.
   The result is a Quayle watch, but don't expect to be able to
mark his time in office with it.
   The numbers on the $30 wristwatch are all scrambled, which
Richard Ongstad says is a reflection of the vice president.
   ``I think that he is a good vice president, he's just in a state
of confusion,'' said Ongstad, one of the two partners in the
venture. The other is keeping his identity secret.
   The two Thousand Oaks men are marketing the addled timepiece
through the Krazy Time Co., which they created especially for the
Quayle watch. They said their first 250 watches were sold in a
single day.

   First came the good news: Construction
worker Layne Landry had won $21.3 million in the lottery!
   Then the bad news for the Landrys: Maybe he didn't.
   Then the good news again: Oh yes, he did!
   Now, reasonably certain that they are, in fact, $21.3 million
richer, Landry and his wife, Bernadette, are doing what so many
rich people don't seem to be able to do. They are keeping quiet.
   ``They don't want any publicity,'' said Tammy Landry, Layne's
sister.
   The Landrys were not immediately certain they won, because they
learned that a Los Angeles TV station first had put the wrong set
of numbers on the screen during a broadcast Wednesday night.
   ``For about an hour, the whole family was in an uproar,'' said
Mrs. Landry's sister, Geri Velasquez of Glendora. She said they
finally called lottery headquarters in Sacramento to confirm the
winning numbers.
   ``By then, everybody was screaming,'' she said.
   It wasn't long before the Riverside couple, both 29, got on the
telephone to ask friends and relatives not to answer questions from
reporters.
   The effort was only partly successful, since Ms. Velasquez was
willing to talk to a reporter about why her sister doesn't want her
to talk to reporters.
   ``She's really scared,'' Ms. Velasquez said. ``I think anyone
who got that much money would be.''
   It was the third-largest individual prize ever awarded in the
California lottery. The only higher prizes went to two winners who
split a $51.4 million Lotto jackpot last June. Other large jackpots
were shared by more winners, or by groups of people who pooled
their money to buy tickets.
   The prizes are paid in installments over 20 years.

   A Soviet air force captain was wounded by
gunfire as he fled a Soviet airport in a fighter jet Saturday and
flew to Turkey, where he requested political asylum in the United
States, Turkish officials said.
   The Soviets said the officer had been discharged from flying for
health reasons and that he shot and wounded a sentry before
stealing the MiG-29 and flying it to Turkey. The Soviets asked
Turkish officials to return the pilot. The pilot, Capt. Alexander
Zuyev, 28, was wounded in the right arm when he was fired o while
taking off from a Soviet airport north of the Black Sea City of
Batumi, said Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Inal Batu.
   The pilot underwent surgery and was in good condition at the
Black Sea University Medical School Hospital in Trabzon, where he
landed, Batu told reporters. Zuyev asked for U.S. asylum while
being questioned in Trabzon, said the city's governor, Enver Hizlan.
   The request was forwarded to the Interior Ministry.
   U.S. Embassy officials in the capital, Ankara, refused to
comment on the subject. In Washington, State Department spokesman
Adam Shub said only that the United States ``understands a Soviet
MiG has landed at Trabzon.''
   He said the United States ``has been in touch with the Turkish
government'' about the incident. When asked if an asylum request
had been received, Shub said, ``I have nothing for you on that.''
   Batu said the Soviet ambassador was called to the Turkish
Foreign Ministry and told that the MiG-29 plane would be returned
to the Soviet Union.
   The Turkish ambassador in Moscow was summoned to the Soviet
Foreign Ministry, where authorities asked for the extradition of
Zuyev, the Anatolia News Agency reported. Batu said Turkey would
review the Soviet request.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Zuyev shot and wounded a sentry
who was guarding the aircraft at Tskhakaya airfield, north of the
Soviet Black Sea coastal city of Batumi. ``Zuyev, a military pilot
who had been discharged from flying for health reasons, hijacked a
fighter plane from Tskhakaya airfield to Trabzon airfield in
Turkey,'' Tass said.
   ``The U.S.S.R. Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested that the
Turkish government extradite the criminal offender and return the
plane,'' Tass said.
   Zuyev belonged to the air force's Mikatachaya unit, Batu said.
   Anatolia quoted local officials as saying the jet landed at 5
a.m.
   The dispatch said the plane was picked up on Turkish radar and
the pilot was warned to turn back but insisted on landing. Anatolia
said the plane was fully armed and a pistol was found in the
cockpit.
   According to Jane's All The World's Aircraft, a MiG-29 is armed
with six medium-range and-or close-range air-to-air missles. It can
also carry other missiles and is able to carry bombs and 57mm, 80mm
and 240mm rockets.

<HEAD>Commerce Secretary Favors Targeting Japan For Possible Trade Retaliation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said
Saturday he believes Japan should be among countries targeted by
the Bush administration for possible retaliation in response to
unfair trade practices.
   Under the ``Super 301'' provision of last year's Trade Act, the
administration has until the end of this month to decide on a list
of countries to target for potential retaliatory action.
   Mosbacher, interviewed on Cable News Network's ``Evans and
Novak'' program, said when asked whether Japan should be on the
list:
   ``Well, in my own opinion, they should be one of those
mentioned. Whether they will be or not is a matter of policy debate
that is going on right now in the Bush headquarters.''
   The United States currently has a trade deficit of more than $50
billion with Japan.
   Mosbacher said he did not believe that ``coming down on bad
trade practices'' would result in a trade war and deterioration of
U.S.-Japan relations.
   ``In my view, even though they (the Japanese) are good friends
and strong allies ... it needs to be brought to their attention
that they are not being good trading partners,'' the commerce
secretary said.

   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble
warned of an increased risk of terrorist attacks following the life
sentence imposed on TWA hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
   ``The risk of terrorist attacks and hijackings has increased
considerably,'' the Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag newspaper quoted
Schaeuble as saying.
   Schaeuble said security had been stepped up at the nation's
airports and that passengers should expect delays because of more
extensive baggage checks, according to the newspaper.
   Hamadi was convicted of murder and air piracy in Frankfurt on
Wednesday in connection with the 1985 hijacking of a TWA airliner.
A U.S. Navy diver was killed and 39 Americans were held hostage for
17 days during the ordeal.
   Hamadi, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was sentenced to life in
prison, the maximum sentenced allowed in West Germany.

   Mayor Coleman Young said the results of blood
tests have convinced him he is the father of a 6-year-old boy at
the center of a paternity suit, and would negotiate child support
payments.
   Tests from three separate laboratories showed the 70-year-old
mayor almost certainly fathered the son of a former city employee.
   ``I said when this paternity suit first came into the news that
I did not believe that I was the father of Joel Loving,'' Young
said Friday.
   ``Well, the results of the blood tests have caused me to
painfully reappraise my position, and I want everyone to know that
I have reappraised that position and I am fully prepared to fulfill
my full responsibilities in that regard.''
   The boy's mother, Annivory Calvert, filed a lawsuit in Wayne
County Circuit Court in January asking for child support.
   Calvert, 34, was executive deputy director of public works in
Detroit before taking the job of director of public works for the
city of Fontana, Calif. She said she and Young dated from 1981-87.
   The divorced mayor, who turns 71 this week, described media
coverage of the matter as ``atrocious. Personally I resent it.
   ``One of the most interesting items of the past year... has had
nothing to do with how the city is running. It's the question of
`Who's the papa?'''

   An explosion at an electrical transformer
left most of Madrid without power for two hours Saturday,
interrupting subway service and causing traffic problems as
stoplights went blank.
   An official at the Union Fenosa electric company said a short
circuit at a transformer in northern Madrid caused the explosion at
8:25 a.m. It cut power to about 70 percent of the capital,
including three subway lines.
   Subway cars on the affected lines reached their next station
under emergency power, where riders were told to get off, Spanish
National Radio said.
   Although service was restored two hours later, subways and some

<TEXT>
   A landscaper who abducted a sleeping
6-year-old girl from her bed and raped her in a neighbor's back
yard was sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison, with an
additional 80 years tacked on.
   Brian Richard Ranalli's attorney conceded Saturday that the
32-year-old man wouldn't be released ``anytime soon.''
   Ranalli allegedly left his home after an argument with his
former girlfriend last Oct. 19, went to the child's home and
abducted and raped her. The child lived in the same neighborhood as
Ranalli in an unincorporated area in eastern Cobb County.
   He was arrested a week later. His former girlfriend testified
that he had returned home the night of the rape with bloodstains
and dirt on his clothes. The child was unable to identify Ranalli
by his face but said she remembered what he was wearing.
   The jury deliberated about four hours Friday night before
convicting Ranalli of all six counts against him.
   Before sentencing, Ranalli told the court, ``I have no
recollection of this incident, or I wouldn't have come to this
court to put everybody through it.''
   Cobb County Superior Court Judge Harris Hines said he was
compelled to impose ``a very severe sentence'' because ``the one
place you would hope you would be safe would be within the confines
of your own home.''

<HEAD>Yellowstone's `Rebirth' On Schedule, Officials Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM ANGELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Buttercups, monkey
flowers, shooting stars and glacier lilies are sprouting up through
the ashes beneath the charred skeletons of once towering pines.
   A heavy winter snowpack and a moist spring have park officials
predicting a ``very, very lush early summer.'' That, plus the
hundreds of thousands of acres that were unaffected by 1988's
ravaging fires, is bringing back tourists.
   The spring's new growth marks Yellowstone's ``rebirth,'' which
researchers say eventually will roll a lush, green carpet over the
areas consumed by last year's firestorms.
   The National Park Service has also decided to combat any fires
that flare-up in Yellowstone this summer. A moratorium placed last
year on the agency's ``let burn'' policy, under which naturally
sparked fires are not fought unless they threaten structures or
people, will remain in place at leat through the end of 1989 while
the Interior Department ponders the wisdom of the policy.
   ``It's gradually coming,'' park spokeswoman Marsha Karle said of
the greening of Yellowstone. ``The grass is coming up. It should be
a beautiful spring and summer. This year, we will see bright green
grass. With a background of black, that will really be a nice
contrast. It will stand out more.''
   Even during the height of the fires that involved almost half of
Yellowstone's 2.2 million acres, biologists promised the flames
would clear the way for growth not seen since the early 1700s, when
extensive forest fires spawned much of the vegetation now seen in
the park.
   And though much of the burned areas appear at first glance to be
sterile, the nutrient-rich ashes are simply hiding new growth.
   ``We are right now in the tail end of winter,'' said John
Varley, the park's chief researcher. ``If you go to the lowest
elevation areas, the stuff that burned around 6,000 feet, what is
coming up is gorgeous. In addition to grass, all of our old friends
(trees and brush) are coming up, popping up out of the soot. Nature
is on schedule.''
   In some areas, such as the road between Old Faithful Geyser and
Norris Junction, it is hard to believe regrowth is occurring.
Charred trees cover the hillsides right up to the road; in places
the leaping flames created mosaics of life and death in the forests.
   In addition to new grasses and wildflowers, researchers expect
the fires to spur a major regrowth in lodgepole pine forests. Pine
cones that require extreme heat to pop and release their seeds did
so during the fires, and researchers believe some burned areas
could see up to 100,000 new trees per acre.
   ``The seeds are there, but it takes a little longer than (one
year) for them to germinate,'' Karle said. ``Over the next few
years, it will occur.''
   While officials have predicted schedules for regrowth, they are
not sure what will replace the dead trees or what will happen to
trees that were only singed and now carry an orange tint.
   ``There are a lot of things where we just don't know what is
going to happen,'' Karle said. ``We can predict to a certain point.
But something like this has not happened in many years. It is like
a big research laboratory.''
   Tourists are also witnessing the harsh side of nature. Many
meadows contain predators gorging on the carcasses of bison and
elk, grim reminders of forage shortages created by last summer's
drought and fires, unusually large herds, and the winter's harsh
cold and deep snow.
   While one visitor this weekend called the landscape ``eerie,''
others said they were not disappointed by the park's appearance.
   ``I'm sorry I didn't come before,'' said Lemuel Taylor, of Fort
Worth, Texas. ``But I think it didn't hurt the park's beauty.''
   Some were prepared for the sights they encountered, such as
Corky LaFlesch of Frenchtown, Mont., who said he tries to visit
Yellowstone once a year.
   ``It is kind of what I expected,'' he said. ``Trees grow back.
My grandkids will see them.''

   The Great Pyramid of Cheops, the most
famous of ancient Egypt's royal tombs, was declared safe for
tourists and reopened Saturday for the first time in nine months.
   A Dutch woman and an American student were the first of the
scores of tourists who waited under the hot Egyptian sun to tour
the pyramid.
   Since August, workers had been sealing cracks, reinforcing
limestone slabs for safety and clearing vermin from the inside of
the magnificent structure, which now boasts television monitors.
   The restoration project was the first step in a five-year plan
to transform the pyramid area, including the Sphinx, into an
open-air museum.
   Gasping after the 155-foot climb to the King's Chamber, Sophie
D'Lang of Rotterdam said she and her husband were spending the last
day of a vacation in Egypt.
   ``I didn't think we had a chance to see inside Cheops,'' said
Mrs. D'Lang, who waited more than three hours for the re-opening.
``I think what they've done is great.''
   Michael Saxton of Dayton, Ohio, said he waited four hours. ``For
me the pyramid has special meaning because of the way it's built.
It's amazing.''
   The Great Pyramid is Egypt's top tourist attraction, and tourist
officials protested when it was closed Aug. 15.
   But the Egyptian Antiquities Organization prevailed with the
argument that newly discovered cracks in blocks lining interior
passages and a half-inch layer of salt on inside walls had to be
fixed without interruption by tourists.
   With a base of 13.1 acres, it stood at 481.4 feet when it was
built 4,600 years ago. Today, it is 31 feet shorter after losing
about a dozen layers and its capstone. It also has lost almost all
its outer facing of hard, white limestone, stripped for use in
stone bridges, irrigation canals, houses, walls and buildings.
   Zahi Hawass, director general of the pyramids area, said nothing
had been done to restore the pyramid's interior since it was opened
in the late 1830s.
   Hawass said in removing salt from the limestone walls, restorers
found weak and cracking rock throughout the pyramid.
   In the Grand Gallery, Hawass said, 500 limestone blocks were
restored and 16 granite slabs reinforced with stainless steel bars.
``Some of these slabs were in critical condition,'' he said.
   Cheops' lidless red granite sarcophagus, soiled by the touch of
generations of tourists, was cleaned of soot, grease and other
filth, Hawass said.
   He said insects and rats, which had invaded the pyramid, were
exterminated. Television monitors were installed to ensure that
visitors behave themselves.
   During the renovation, rubble was cleared and lighting added to
a chamber winding 396 feet beneath the pyramid, opening it to
tourists for the first time.
   Of the seven monuments listed as Wonders of the World by Greeks
of the second century B.C., only Cheops and the other two large
Giza pyramids remain intact.
   The remaining monuments on the list _ the statue of Zeus in
Olympia, Artemis' temple in Ephesus, the Colossus of Rhodes, the
mausoleum of Halicarnassus in Asia Minor and the Pharos lighthouse
in Alexandria _ were destroyed by warfare or earthquakes.

<DATELINE>EXETER, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent citizen is killed by a shotgun
blast while opening his front door in a small, seacoast town. A
veteran police officer shocks the community by confessing to the
crime.
   Last week, former Officer Robert McLaughlin dropped another
bomb. He said his wife pulled the trigger.
   The 48-year-old McLaughlin's testimony was the latest twist in a
confounding mystery in tiny Hampton, N.H., where McLaughlin lived a
short distance from Robert Cushing, a well-known real estate agent
and former teacher.
   Two weeks ago, McLaughlin's wife, Susan, 36, was convicted of
being an accomplice to the murder of Cushing, 63, who was felled by
two shotgun blasts the evening of June 1, 1988.
   Mrs. McLaughlin is appealing the conviction, for which she
received the mandatory sentence of life in prison without parole.
   Prosecutors charge that McLaughlin killed Cushing, with Mrs.
McLaughlin serving as an accomplice, to settle a grudge that dated
to 1976 when Cushing intervened while McLaughin was making a
traffic arrest and told authorities that McLaughin had used
brutality.
   Last week, he made a surprise appearance on the witness stand at
a hearing Tuesday and Wednesday on his motion to suppress his
confession. His murder trial is scheduled to start May 31.
   It took McLaughlin two days, nearly six hours on the witness
stand and dozens of prodding questions from prosecutors and defense
attorneys before he said his wife had killed their neighbor.
   He said Mrs. McLaughlin told him about the death a few hours
after the shooting.
   ``I thought she was kidding,'' the haggard-looking McLaughlin
testified. ``I was advised by her that if I didn't believe her to
go out and look and see for myself.''
   McLaughlin, a Hampton police officer for 18 years, said his wife
threatened to implicate him in the murder if he turned her in. He
said he hoped that if he turned himself in, she eventually would
come forward.
   He also said he told his son, Robert Jr., that Mrs. McLaughin
killed Cushing.
   Robert Jr. had been the star prosecution witness at the trial of
Susan McLaughlin, his stepmother, telling the court that his father
admitted killing Cushing with help from Mrs. McLaughlin.
   Prosecutors say Mrs. McLaughlin helped her husband plot the
killing and stood guard, disguised as a man, while he committed the
crime.
   Robert McLaughlin Jr. sat unemotionally through his father's
testimony last week, seated a row behind Robert Cushing Jr., the
victim's son, who is a locally prominent anti-nuclear activist.
   McLaughlin told police last August that he had turned himself in
because he couldn't stand seeing Cushing's widow sitting on her
deck a short distance from the McLaughlins' apartment.
   Defense attorneys say the statement should be suppressed because
of McLaughlin's impaired mental and physical condition at the time
he gave it. But the judge ruled Friday that the statements will be
admissable.
   McLaughlin, dismissed by Hampton police last fall, has been in
jail since August.
   If McLaughlin is telling the truth about his wife's involvement
in the killing, prosecutors say, there would be no point of
charging her with the murder since she's already serving the
maximum sentence allowed by law on her conviction as an accomplice.

   The Chinese leadership, in choosing to impose
martial law and crack down on pro-democracy demonstrators, is
making ``a stupid and potentially tragic mistake'' that could lead
to their own downfall, Winston Lord, the former U.S. ambassador to
China, predicted on Saturday.
   Lord, who left China after President Bush's visit there earlier
this year, argued on CNN's ``Newsmaker Saturday'' that any violent
repression ordered by the leadership will short-lived, and that the
reform movement will survive.
   ``They have made a serious mistake in my view,'' Lord said of
the government's imposition of martial law. ``Whatever the
short-term repression ... it's going to be temporary.''
   The former ambassador called the reform movement ``too broad and
too strong'' to be halted. ``It will come back. There have to be
changes,'' he predicted.
   Lord argued that the students' demands were moderate and could
``easily have been met.''
   ``If the students had said we must have multi-party elections
next week, or that we must overthrow the government or the
Communist Party, then you could understand why the authorities were
resisting them. But they were asking for a freer expression,
anti-corruption and specific goals that could have been met,'' Lord
said.
   ``I think the government is making a stupid and potentially
tragic mistake,'' Lord added.
   Kenneth Lieberthal, the head of Chinese studies at the
University of Michigan, agreed with Lord, contending a crackdown
might not be successful because support for the students ``is just
extraordinary _ it extends into high levels of the party, the
government, the propaganda apparatus and some of the security
forces.''
   ``While there may be bloodshed in the next few days ... over the
longer run, the people who have been visibly associated with making
this decision are not going to have very long-term political
careers in China,'' said Lieberthal, who appeared on the same
program with Lord.
   Lord charged that Premier Li Peng, who appears to have won a
major victory with his hard-line approach to the demonstrators, has
incited the demonstrators because of his accusations that the
movement was a political conspiracy directed only by a handful of
people.
   ``Just watch the TV broadcasts _ to say that, you have to be on
another planet,'' Lord said, pointing out that even the old, blind
and young have taken to the streets to oppose the intervention of
the People's Liberation Army against the demonstrators.
   Lord predicted that hard-liners like Li Peng, who appear to have
forced the resignation of the more liberal Communist Party General
Secretary Zhao Ziyang, might be gone within a year because they
will be tainted by the violence of the crackdown.
   ``I dont' think you should count on the present constellation
(of leaders) remaining in place, and I wouldn't count out people
like Zhao Ziyang, who are temporarily eclipsed,'' Lord said.
   The former U.S. official said it was possible that Zhao has
stepped from the limelight in order to avoid being tied to the
hard-line approach, or could have been forced out. Lord noted that
such leaders as Deng Xiaoping have lost power and then returned at
a later time, adding, ``Zhou could come back.''
   Lieberthal even contended that the student movement has provided
Zhou ``with a potential political base that he could use to
galvanize the country, push reform forward and produce unity.
   ``He is the one figure who could potentially calm the situation,
if he acted boldly and had the proper opportunity to do so,'' the
China specialist said.

   The three top opposition leaders
defied a ban on rallies and marched through the streets on
Saturday, their first public appearance since they were badly
beaten following the May 7 election.
   Presidential candidate Guillermo Endaro and vice presidential
candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford were assaulted
by paramilitary forces of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on May 10.
   Independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading
the Noriega-picked government candidates in the national election
when Noriega's troops seized election ballots.
   The results of the election were annulled by the government.
   The government Saturday prohibited ``marches, meetings, public
demonstrations or caravans of vehicles'' by any political
organization until at least June 5.
   ``The prohibition does not have any meaning to us,'' Endara said
as he wended through an outdoor market in San Miguelito on this
capital's eastern outskirts. The stop was one of six made by a
caravan of about 20 opposition vehicles.
   The caravan briefly blocked traffic on some major arteries
leading into the capital. Police watched but took no action.
   Endara said the caravan was designed ``to thank the people for
their support May 7.''
   Ford said the action was intended ``to reconstruct the
confidence of the people in order to make another push.''
   The tour had all the trappings of a classic campaign swing, with
much kissing of babies, hand-pumping and shouts of ``Viva nuestro
presidente!'' or ``Long live our president.''
   A vendor at the Rio Abajo market shouted of Endara: ``He's the
true president of Panama!''
   The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique
saying the prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the
imminent visit by delegates from the Organization of American
States.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, Trinidad and
Tobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are
due in Panama on Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of
Panama's 15-month-old government crisis.
   The organization on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of
Noriega, the commander of the Panamanian Defense Forces and the
real ruler of Panama.
   The government said the prohibition of political street activity
was imposed to comply with the clause in the OAS resolution calling
on ``the authorities and all political forces in Panama to abstain
from any measure or action that could aggravate the crisis.''
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February
1988, when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
Noriega has survived economic sanctions and international pressure,
accusing the United States of seeking to scrap a treaty that will
give Panama full control and supervision of the Panama Canal by the
end of the century.

   A court on Saturday convicted seven people
on public health, negligence and fraud charges but acquitted them
of manslaughter in the sale of counterfeit cooking oil that caused
nearly 700 deaths.
   Six others were convicted of lesser health violations and fraud
charges, and 24 of the original 37 defendants were acquitted.
   Hundreds of people affected by the oil shouted ``Murderers! We
want justice!'' as the verdicts were read.
   Special riot police were called in to clear the courtroom.
Police outside the court fired rubber bullets in the air to
disperse hundreds of the afflicted and their families, who broke
windows as they tried to get back inside.
   Police arrested at least one woman and several people fainted,
but no injuries were reported.
   Thousands of people are still suffering from the oil, which
affected their lungs and nervous systems, and the government has
paid more than $400 million for their health care. Although
prosecutors had demanded long prison terms for the principal
defendants, the maximum penalty was 20 years.
   The defendants included importers, commodities dealers and
retailers. Prosecutors say they conspired in the spring of 1981 to
sell as cheap olive oil rapeseed oil that had been adulterated with
aniline dye and intended for industrial use only.
   Vendors later sold the oil in plastic jugs at weekly fairs and
markets in Spain.
   The harshest sentences went to oil importer Juan Manuel
Bengoechea and oil distributors Ramon Ferrero and Jorge Pich. The
three were convicted of gross professional negligence.
   Bengoechea and Pich also were convicted of violating the public
health code, and Ferrero was found guilty of fraud.
   Bengoechea was sentenced to 20 years in prison and fined 100,000
pesetas, or $854. He was acquitted of 600 counts of manslaughter.
   Ferrero received a 12-year prison sentence. He was acquitted of
numerous manslaughter charges. Pich was sentenced to 10 years in
prison.
   Two other defendants _ Elias Ferrero and Candido Hernandez _
were convicted only of fraud and sentenced to four years and two
months in prison each. They also were acquitted of manslaughter
charges.
   The court also convicted Enrique Salamo and Ramon Alabart of
violating the public health code. They each received a prison
sentence of four years and two months and were fined $854 each. The
court acquitted them of manslaughter.
   Bengoechea's brother, Fernando, was acquitted of manslaughter
and health code violation charges.
   During the 15-month trial, the three-judge tribunal heard
testimony from hundreds of the estimated 23,000 people still
suffering the effects of ``toxic syndrome,'' as the illness became
popularly known, and from relatives of those who have died from the
illness since it was detected in the spring of 1981.
   The trial began March 30, 1987, and the tribunal took another 11
months to reach the verdict after testimony ended. It was the
longest trial in the history of Spain, which does not have jury
trials.
   The prosecutor had asked for more than 85,088 years in combined
prison sentences for the eight principal defendants. Under Spain's
constitution, time served in prison is limited to 30 years.
   The tribunal said the prosecution proved a link between the
adulterated rapeseed oil and the deadly illness. The tribunal said
the principal defendants were aware the oil was toxic, although the
exact nature of the poison was unknown.
   The defense claimed there was no proof the oil caused the deaths
and illnesses.
   It is generally agreed that 8-year-old Jaime Vaquero Garcia, who
died May 1, 1981, was the first victim of the oil. His death at the
time was attributed to ``acute pulmonory insufficiency.''
   The prosecution based its case on 600 deaths, although medical
researchers say the number of dead is closer to 700.
   The government has paid $406 million in indemnities and health
care for those still suffering from the effects of the illness,
which affects the lungs and nervous system.
   An ongoing, separate judicial investigation into the role of
government officials in the case has not resulted in any charges.

   About 3,500 Chinese students, in a raucous
exercise of the democratic rights sought by their colleagues at
home, marched upon their embassy Saturday, shouting ``Down with
martial law!'' and ``Freedom now!''
   The hastily organized sympathy demonstration drew participants
from more than a score of American universities. Some were natives
of Taiwan or Hong Kong, but the vast majority were citizens of
mainland China.
   There are an estimated 40,000 students from the People's
Republic of China in the United States. Virtually all are in
postgraduate studies, and about half are financially supported by
their government. Others have won U.S. scholarships or obtained
other outside sponsorship.
   On a day when many students were beaten by police in Beijing,
the U.S. demonstrators were given a full escort and high praise by
capital law enforcement officers, who diverted traffic from an
eight-block stretch of Connecticut Avenue as the marchers made
their way from Dupont Circle to the Chinese Embassy.
   ``We've had no problems whatsoever,'' said Deputy Chief E. J.
Spurlock of the D.C. Metropolitan Police, who estimated the
marchers totaled 3,500. ``These are the nicest people I've ever
met,'' he said.
   The marchers, many wearing shorts and T-shirts on a bright,
balmy day, chanted ``Down with Li Peng,'' the premier of China, and
``Down with Deng Xiaoping,'' the senior Communist Party leader.
Most wore headbands with ``Democracy'' scrawled in both English and
Chinese lettering.
   The marchers paused for about 30 minutes in front of the embassy
before returning down the avenue for a final rally and dispersal.
Embassy officials did not emerge from the building during the
protest, and they declined to take reporters' calls about it.
   In a fashion reminiscent of scores of civil rights
demonstrations in Washington in earlier years, leaders of the
march, armed with bullhorns, would shout: ``What do we want?''
   ``Democracy!'' came the answering cry.
   ``When do we want it?''
   ``Now!''
   Chen Li Ming, a mathematics student at Cornell University and a
native of Xing Jiang in Northwest China, said neither he nor his
student colleagues in China seek to overthrow the Communist Party
or reverse the socialist economy. ``Everybody knows that would not
be realistic,'' said Chen, whose studies are paid for by his
government.
   ``But we want a China that makes more sense,'' he said. ``We
want more freedom, more economic improvement. We want to learn and
adopt some of the good things about capitalist systems, and get rid
of the worst things about the socialist system.''
   Chen was among about 30 Chinese students who made the trip from
Cornell, despite disrupting studies for final exams _ now occurring
at most other universities as well. Other sizable contingents came
from Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Brandeis, the University of
Virginia, Duke, New York University, Johns Hopkins, the University
of California, Pittsburgh, and the University of Pennsylvania as
well as several schools in the Washington area.
   The march was organized in less than two days. It followed the
martial-law decree of the Chinese government, declared early
Saturday in Beijing.
   Qiao Chun Ming, a student from Shanghai at the University of
Pittsburgh, said ``We want to show our support for other people who
are fighting for our freedom, and to show our own government that
its position is wrong.
   Qiao said he was disappointed in the ``weak'' tone of the Bush
administration's support for the students. ``But we want to express
our thanks to the American reporters, especially the Cable News
Network and CBS and Dan Rather, who have carried our story to the
world,'' he added.

   Eighteen drug traffickers convicted by
Islamic courts were hanged on Saturday, Tehran radio reported.
   It was the fourth mass execution of drug smugglers since May 13,
raising the total to 623 since December.
   An anti-narcotics law enacted in January mandates the death
sentence for any person caught with even small quantities of drugs.
   The radio broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, said the public
executions took place in the southeastern port city of Chabahar and
the northeastern cities of Mashhad and Shirwan.
   The cities are in Kerman and Sistan-Baluchistan provinces, which
border Pakistan and Afghanistan, the source of drugs smuggled into
Iran, officials claim.

   After a delay of more than a month, a
train carrying 1,500 tons of emergency food supplies left Saturday
for war-ravaged southern Sudan, an official reported.
   Abdul Rahman Hilou, acting relief commissioner, said the train
left Muglad in southwestern Sudan on its way to Aweil, a
government-held town 180 miles farther south, where it will deliver
some of the foodstuffs.
   He said the train, with 48 freight cars, also will unload
supplies in Malwal and Maput, two rebel-held towns between Muglad
and Aweil.
   Organizing the relief shipment is Operation Lifeline Sudan. It
is part of a U.N. effort to prevent a repeat of last year's
disaster when up to 500,000 people perished of starvation and
disease in villages isolated by Sudan's 6-year-old civil war.
   Officials say at least 100,000 people are threatened with
starvation.
   The train had been scheduled to depart on April 15 but its crews
refused to travel through embattled area without an armed escort. A
further delay was caused by government objections to providing food
to areas controlled by rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army.
   The $132 million program seeks to stockpile 100,000 tons of food
in southern Sudan by the end of this month, but less than half of
that amount has been delivered.
   U.N. officials have said the operation is a race against time
and seasonal rains that begin in May and turn roads and airfields
into quagmires until November.
   The mainly Christian and animist rebels began their struggle in
early 1983, demanding greater autonomy and economic reforms from
the predominantly Moslem Khartoum government for the three southern
provinces of Bahr el-Ghazal, Upper Nile and Equatoria.

   Pro-PLO leaders of the Palestinian uprising
issued a rare call Saturday for retaliatory slayings of Israelis.
Two teen-agers shot by soldiers died of their wounds and 16 were
reported injured in clashes.
   The deaths increased the number of Palestinian fatalities in the
17-month-old uprising to 494. Twenty-two Israelis have been killed.
   Also Saturday, Israeli police said they were investigating the
death of a 32-year-old Palestinian whose body was found at the
Jewish factory in the West Bank where he worked as a night watchman.
   The latest deaths came a day after a gun and grenade battle in
the West Bank that claimed the lives of an Israeli soldier and
three Palestinians.
   It was the first gun battle reported during the uprising between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians, who generally have attacked
troops with stones and firebombs.
   A leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising who are
linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization said ``the enemy
should pay an expensive price for its crimes.''
   ``The Unified National Leadership of the Uprising calls on the
strike forces to kill a settler or a soldier for every martyr of
our sons,'' said the leaflet, the 40th published in the territories
since the start of the anti-Israeli rebellion.
   Uprising leaders have made repeated calls for attacks on Israeli
targets, but in the past have stopped short of urging retaliatory
killings. Most attacks on Israelis during the uprising have been by
stonings or firebombs, which have often not been lethal.
   The underground leaflet urged Arab countries ``to work on
liquidating'' Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's plan for
elections in the occupied territories when they convene for a
summit in Morocco this week.
   It also supported the killing of Palestinian collaborators with
Israel.
   PLO chief Yasser Arafat warned that the use of arms may increase
if Palestinian deaths continue to climb.
   ``So far our people refrained from using arms in resisting the
occupation forces, but the Israelis should understand that our
patience is limited,'' Arafat told reporters Saturday in Baghdad,
Iraq.
   The army maintained a curfew on most of the Gaza Strip. Most of
the territory's 700,000 residents have been confined indoors for
nearly a week.
   An army spokesman said the curfew would be lifted Sunday and
that 50,000 Gazans employed in Israel would be allowed to return to
their jobs for the first time since Tuesday when they were barred
from entering Israel.
   Mazni Abu Hatla, 13, of the Gaza town of Rafah, died in a
hospital Saturday, Arab reports said. He was shot in the chest
Friday during a riot, according to the reports.
   Ali Abdallah Mohammed Abdallah, 18, of El Khader in the West
Bank, also died Saturday. He was shot in the head in a clash May
10, Arab reports said.
   In the West Bank on Saturday, a 13-year-old boy was wounded in
the back during a clash between stone-throwing rioters and soldiers
in the town of Anabta, Arab reports said.
   Seven Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets or beatings in
the West Bank, and eight were wounded or injured in the Gaza Strip,
Arab reports said.
   The army said it had no reports of casualties.
   Authorities were conducting an autopsy to determine how Naji
Mohammed Fakih, 32, of the West Bank town of Qatana, died, Arab
reports said.
   Mordechai Bareket, a police spokesman, said relatives found
Fakih dead on his bed Saturday when they came to visit him at his
workplace in a factory in the Mishor Adumim settlement near
Jerusalem.
   Bareket, who spoke in a telephone interview, suggested it was
unclear whether Fakih was slain or died of an illness. He said an
autopsy was being conducted.
   Arab reports said Fakih's family believed he had choked or been
strangled.

   West German officials voiced optimism
Saturday that a dispute with the United States over short-range
nuclear missiles would be settled in a way that maintained NATO
unity.
   The officials, attending a conference here on U.S.-West German
relations, said the administration had accepted the principle of
negotiations with the Soviet Union over the missiles.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Saturday
that West Germany's proposal for resolving the dispute is too vague
and must be linked more closely with reductions in the Warsaw
Pact's superiority in conventional forces.
   Baker, speaking in Kennebunkport, Maine, said Washington has
sent a counterproposal to Bonn and is awaiting a response.
   West German officials said negotiations would be linked at some
indefinite point to talks now under way in Vienna designed to
reduce tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear forces in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   They would not be held until the Soviet-led alliance agreed to
sizable reductions in its forces, the officials said.
   The acceptance of negotiations at some point represented a major
concession by the Bush administration. The West Germans, meanwhile,
relented in their demands for ``speedy'' negotiations.
   Baker on Saturday did not rule out eventual East-West
negotiations on curbing short-range nuclear weapons, as Germany has
urged over opposition from the United States.
   ``It's the view of our government that negotiations are a
mistake unless there are significant conditions with respect
thereto,'' said Baker, who commented after President Bush and
visiting French President Francois Mitterrand held a round of talks
at Bush's seaside vacation home.
   Baker told reporters that Bonn's proposal calls for negotiations
at too early a stage, without significant progress in talks to
reduce Warsaw Pact troops, tanks and other conventional forces.
   Baker said the U.S. counterproposal envisions postponing until
1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that have
a greater range and are faster than the U.S.-produced Lance
missiles stationed in West Germany.
   Helmut Schaefer, the West German deputy foreign minister, and
other officials said the United States still wanted to rule out the
option of negotiating the elimination of all short-range nuclear
missiles in NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals.
   Schaefer said West Germany wanted to leave open the option of
getting down to zero. ``We ought to see the circumstances before we
give up options,'' he said.
   The U.S. terms for a compromise are to be taken up in Bonn
Sunday by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher and Stoltenberg.
   If the dispute is not settled it could disrupt the NATO summit
meeting to be held May 29-30 in Brussels, Belgium.
   The U.S. terms included a major American concession. For months,
the Bush administration had ruled out any negotiations with the
Soviets over the missiles, saying they were essential to the
defense of Western Europe.
   West Germany, backed by several other NATO countries, demanded
negotiations and also opposed making NATO's missiles more powerful,
as the Unied States, Britain and France wanted.
   The potential compromise would permit improving the missiles,
but by the time the work began arsenals might be reduced through
negotiations _ or even eliminated, if West Germany has its way.
   There are 88 U.S.-built Lance launchers with about 700
single-warhead muclear missiles based in Western Europe, most of
them in West Germany.
   All the major West German political parties are united in the
demand for negotiations out of concern their country is the
likeliest battlefield in the event of a nuclear war in Europe.
   Schaefer said Britain and France ``give us advice but don't have
the weapons'' on their soil.
   Short-range nuclear missiles, which can have a range of up to
300 miles, are designed to deter a Soviet attack.
   But Schaefer, in a speech to the American-German conference
here, said ``we have to reconsider our positions and our strategies
in NATO'' in response to arms control overtures of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He criticized the Bush administration, saying it was ``sitting
back and discussing whether Gorbachev is going to fail or not.''
   Schaefer said the missiles dispute with the United States had
produced ``some irritations'' but that West Germany's support for
NATO had not flagged.
   At the same time, the deputy foreign minister said, it would be
a mistake to foreclose the elimination of all NATO and Warsaw Pact
short-range missiles.
   He said ``dramatic cuts'' in Warsaw Pact conventional forces
could make banning all ground-based short-range missiles feasible.
   Schaefer said the Bush administration's initial opposition to
negotiations ``is not backed, if I follow the polls, by the
majority of Americans.''
   He said he was optimistic that the U.S. and West German
governments would work out ``a good compromise'' preserving NATO
unity.
   Schaefer and other West German officials said later the proposal
presented to Defense Minister Stoltenberg in Washington would delay
missile negotiations until the Warsaw Pact agreed to make sharp
reductions in its non-nuclear forces.
   Then, Schaefer said, the missile negotiations would begin in a
``synchronized way'' that at this point did not have a fixed date.
Initially, the West Germans had demanded the U.S.-Soviet
negotiations begin ``speedily.''
   The conference here is sponsored by the American Council on
Germany, a private group based in New York. It brought together
government officials, educators, business executives and
journalists from the two countries.

   The Bush administration said
Saturday that West Germany's proposal for resolving a NATO crisis
over short-range nuclear missiles is too vague and must be linked
more closely with reductions in the Warsaw Pact's superiority in
conventional forces.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Washington has sent a
counterproposal to Bonn and is awaiting a response.
   At a news conference, Baker did not rule out eventual East-West
negotiations on curbing short-range nuclear weapons, as Germany has
urged over opposition from the United States.
   ``It's the view of our government that negotiations are a
mistake unless there are significant conditions with respect
thereto,'' Baker said, apparently reversing himself on flatly
rejecting such talks.
   Baker commented after President Bush and visiting French
President Francois Mitterrand held a round of talks here at Bush's
seaside vacation home.
   Addressing the crackdown in China against students demonstrating
for democracy, Baker said, ``I don't think it's in the best
interest of the United States for us to see significant
instability'' in China.
   While saying the United States supports freedom of speech and
assembly, Baker said, ``I don't think we should in any way be seen
to be inciting to riot.''
   The top item on the Bush-Mitterrand agenda was the rift in NATO
caused by West Germany's call for East-West missile negotiations.
   Amid a wave of disarmament feeling in West Germany, Bonn also is
resisting a plan to triple the range and increase the speed of the
U.S.-made Lance missiles deployed in West Germany against the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact forces.
   The disagreement has clouded plans for a 16-nation NATO summit
opening in Brussels on May 29. Bush will leave Washington for
Europe on Friday, stopping in Rome for two nights before traveling
to Belgium.
   Despite the NATO flap, Baker said Bush and Mitterrand had
concluded ``that the West has seldom been in a stronger position.''
   He said the two leaders, conferring in Bush's shingle and stone
house overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, thought the NATO summit would
be ``a successful and forward-looking event.''
   The secretary brushed aside criticism from Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who accused Bush of responding too
timidly to the disarmament initiatives of Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev.
   ``I suppose we would have to conclude, perhaps, that the
honeymoon is over,'' Baker said.
   Baker told reporters it was fair to say that Bonn's proposal
calls for negotiations at too early a stage _ that is, without
significant progress in talks to reduce Warsaw Pact troops, tanks
and other conventional forces.
   ``We think the conditions must be more significant and we think
that they must be more clearly expressed and that there must be
considerably more progress with respect to the completion and
implementation of a conventional forces agreement,'' the secretary
said.
   He said Mitterrand was in ``complete agreement'' on the general
outlines of the U.S. position.
   Baker said the U.S. counterproposal envisions postponing until
1992 a decision on deployment and production of missiles that have
a greater range and are faster than the U.S.-produced Lance
missiles stationed in West Germany.
   He said the proposal, if accepted, would continue an agreement
by the alliance ``to keep our forces up to date where necessary and
an affirmation by the alliance of the United States' development of
a follow-on system to the Lance.''
   Sources in Germany and the United States had indicated earlier
that a compromise was near on the missile argument.
   They said the Bush administration, after originally rejecting
the idea, had accepted the idea of eventual negotiations.
   However, Bonn would have to make clear it does not seek
elimination of the missiles, and the talks would be conditional on
an unspecified improvement in the East-West balance of conventional
arms, according to sources.
   Awaiting Mitterrand's arrival, Bush said the two had a friendly,
personal relationship and that he was looking forward to
``informal, in-depth, wide-ranging conversations.''
   Bush clapped his hands twice and exclaimed ``bienvenue'' as he
greeted Mitterrand and his wife, Danielle, as they stepped from a
helicopter on a warm, sunny day. Mrs. Bush was waiting to greet
them nearby at the Bush's shingle and stone house overlooking the
Atlantic Ocean.
   France is not a part of NATO's integrated military command, and
Mitterrand has made public comments straddling the gap between
Washington and Bonn.
   At a news conference Thursday, Mitterrand said ``the time has
not come, far from it'' when NATO could eliminate all the
short-range nuclear missiles in central Europe.
   At the same time, Mitterrand said NATO would not have to decide
about modernizing the battlefield missiles until 1992.
   For their talks, Bush and Mitterrand were accompanied by foreign
policy advisers, notetakers, and interpreters.
   At lunch, they dined on corn chowder and oriental chicken salad.
The dinner menu called for broiled shrimp, steamed Maine lobster
and charcoal broiled swordfish.
   Later Saturday, Bush went fishing while Mitterrand worked on a
speech. Then, the two leaders took a 45-minute walk through the
woods near Bush's compuond.
   Bush, as he had done earlier, shrugged off questions about the
current turmoil in China but appeared eager to talk about the
results of his fishing trip, claiming he had caught two fish
including what he called, ``une mackerel grande.''
   Mitterrand, asked by reporters who surrounded the two presidents
in the woods what he and Bush had been talking about, he said in
French ``we've been talking about fish and fishing.''
   To accommodate Mitterrand and his wife as overnight guests, the
Bushes borrowed a king-sized bed from for a local furniture store.
   Bush and Mitterrand will travel together to Boston on Sunday
where they will receive honorary degrees, make speeches and hold a
joint news conference.
   Bush's address is supposed to be a major speech on NATO.
   He is expected to say the defense of Europe depends on the
forward deployment of substantial U.S. conventional and nuclear
forces.
   At the same time, Bush is expected to say he has a vision of a
less militarized Europe and that he looks for a lessened
preponderance of Eastern European forces and greater openness.
   While their husbands talked, Mrs. Bush and Mrs. Mitterrand
traveled to Portland for a private luncheon, boat trip and museum
tour.

<HEAD>Christian Commander Accuses Syria of Sending Jets Over Lebanon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RODEINA KENAAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Christian army commander Michel Aoun on
Saturday accused Syria of sending jets on ``provocative runs'' over
Lebanon in a plot to continue occupying the war-torn country.
   Gen. Aoun, whose 20,000 mostly Christian soldiers have been
confronting an alliance of the Syrian army and Moslem Druse
militiamen, made the charge in a letter to Arab heads of state,
pleading with them to ``save Lebanon.''
   Aoun claimed Syrian air threats and persistent shelling of the
Christian coast threaten to ruin a cease-fire called by the Arab
League May 11 to halt the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's
14-year-old civil war.
   Aoun, who heads a Christian military Cabinet in Lebanon's dual
government, did not say when and where the Syrian jets made their
overflights.
   But Lebanese media reports said a pair of MiG-17 Syrian jets
twice flew at low altitude over Lebanon's central mountains in the
Christian enclave north of Beirut on Wednesday and Thursday.
   The last known Syrian overflights of Lebanon were in the early
days of Israel's invasion in 1982. Israel claimed it shot down 80
Syrian jet fighters in dogfights over east Lebanon's
Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley.
   Aoun, who spoke at his shell-ravaged presidential palace in
suburban Baabda east of Beirut, warned Arab heads of state, who
meet Tuesday in Morocco, against ``letting Syria swallow Lebanon.''
   ``You just cannot possibly keep silent about the continuous
crime to starve most of the Lebanese population and force a certain
(Christian) community down to its knees,'' Aoun said.
   Syria maintains 40,000 soldiers on 70 percent of Lebanon's
territory under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the Arab League.
But Aoun has charged that the Syrians have lost their credibility
as peacekeepers by siding with the Moslems. He declared a ``war of
liberation'' to drive them out.
   He also clamped a blockade March 6 against illegal harbors run
by Moslem militias south of Beirut in a bid to re-establish state
authority.
   Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's militia, joined by Syrian
gunners, retaliated by shelling the 310-square-mile Christian
enclave, sealing off its land exits and blockading its ports with
shellfire.
   By police count, 359 people have been killed and 1,393 wounded
since the fighting erupted March 8.
   Aoun said the United States and the Soviet Union were morally
obligated to intervene to stop the Syrian army from shelling the
enclave, home for 1 million Christians.
   He rebutted U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III's
contention that the United States cannot do anything to influence
the Syrians in Lebanon. ``The Americans can alter the blockade
against us with one single word,'' he said.

   Elderly women, old men smoking pipes, mothers
with their babies and thousands of students blocked major
intersections early Sunday in a defiant blockade to protect an
8-day-old student demonstration for democratic reform.
   Crowds in Beijing rolled huge cement pipes, six feet in
diameter, in front of roads. Truck drivers moved their flatbed
trailers, packed with coal, into position.
   Every major street going east-west and most major streets going
north-south were blocked. By 6 a.m. (5 p.m. Saturday EDT), the
government apparently had given in to the blockade and students
began moving roadblocks out of the way.
   ``Dawn is breaking!'' people shouted as the sky grew lighter.
``The people have won again!''
   Men in white headbands that read ``Freedom and Democracy''
checked identification cards, looking for military or security
personnel.
   ``It's only natural,'' said a middle-aged man who lived in the
neighborhood. ``We are protecting the people.''
   At Liu Li Qiao in southwest Beijing, thousands of local
residents assisted by students confronted a convoy of 20 army
trucks holding more than 600 soldiers. About 30 trucks with coal
and scrap metal also blocked the way.
   ``The People's Liberation Army belongs to the people!'' the
crowd chanted. ``Patriotism is no crime!''
   Young men climbed on the trucks and talked to soldiers. Some
soldiers laughed and discussed the student movement, sitting back
with automatic rifles in their laps. Others refused to talk with
the students.
   Students clutching microphones spoke to the crowd and the
soldiers from atop the cabs of the convoy.
   ``Dear soldiers,'' said a letter read by a woman in a hoarse
voice. ``Now is the critical time. Listen to the people surrounding
you. Our movement is a patriotic, democratic movement.''
   Liu Li Qiao was the scene of a confrontation between students
and People's Armed Police on Saturday after thousands of people
refused to let soldiers pass. A student involved in the clash said
45 of his classmates were injured when security forces attacked
them with electric cattle prods.
   Sunday morning the crowd was peaceful, but not boisterous.
   ``Who are you going to hit?'' an elderly woman yelled at the
soldiers. ``Are you going to shoot students or the people? I think
you should go home to your families.''
   On Friday night, Premier Li Peng and President Yang Shangkun
announced that China was sending troops to Beijing to end the
pro-democracy protests.
   Early Saturday, Li declared martial law in some areas of the
city, but the government so far has been unable to enforce it.
   ``People's power is unstoppable,'' said a middle-aged man as he
stood with his child near the troop trucks. ``I just can't believe
they would kill our own students.''
   Chinese sources said authorities have brought in army troops
from outside Beijing to carry out martial law because the 38th
Army, assigned to protect Beijing, has refused to suppress the
movement.
   At Liu Li Qiao, the army was from Shanxi. Another army pushed
back from an intersection early Saturday hailed from Hebei. To the
elation of the crowds there, they were forced to retreat early
Saturday.
   On Sunday morning, soldiers again attempted to break through the
people's line. Two city buses, a truck packed with old furniture
and a sit-in demonstration of about 800 blocked the way.
   ``Chinese people have always felt close to their soldiers,''
said one man at the Liu Li Qiao intersection. ``So we must educate
them about what's happening in Beijing. We also have been giving
them food and water. They are our brothers.''
   China army plays an important role in society, responding to
disasters, engaging in construction projects, operating factories,
publishing houses and movie studios.
   Uniformed soldiers can be found everywhere in China and are
referred to as ``Uncle Soldier.''
   On Sunday, many protesters said they felt no emnity toward
soldiers.
   ``They are puppets, like everybody else in China,'' said an old
man as he smoked his pipe and watched the scene at Liu Li Qiao.
``Everybody in their hearts wants democracy and to protect the
students. We are just afraid they will listen to their orders and
not their hearts.''

   The Bush administration said
Saturday it was not in the best interest of the United States to
have ``significant instability'' in China and said Washington did
not want to be seen as encouraging student demonstrators to riot.
   ``What may be happening here is that the economic reforms in
China got out a little bit ahead of the political reforms,'' said
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Meanwhile, in Washington the State Department issued a travel
alert, warning American citizens to avoid travel to China and
urging those already there to stay off the streets.
   ``We recommend that U.S. citizens defer travel to the People's
Republic of China for the next 72 hours,'' said spokesman Adam
Shub. ``Travelers in Beijing are being advised not to leave their
hotels or immediate residential areas.''
   An administration source, who spoke privately, said it appeared
U.S. citizens were not in any danger from the demonstrators, noting
some used a replica of the Statue of Liberty in their protests.
   ``That speaks for itself,'' the source said. But he said the
department had issued the alert to warn citizens against being
caught up in the ongoing demonstrations.
   Baker spoke at a news conference where he reported on talks
between President Bush and visiting French President Francois
Mitterrand. He said both presidents, conferring at Bush's vacation
home, hoped for restraint in China.
   His comments came as hundreds of thousands of students
demonstrating for democracy defied a martial law declaration and
swarmed into the streets in Beijing.
   The Bush administration has refrained from criticizing the
Beijing government for its promised crackdown on the demonstrators.
   Taking a cautious approach, Baker said, ``I don't think it's in
the best interest of the United States for us to see significant
instability in the Peoples Republic of China just like I don't
think it's in the best interest of the United States for us to see
significant instability in the Soviet Union.
   Asked why the United States was not encouraging the students,
Baker said, ``I think we should be expressing our support for
freedom of speech, for democratization and for freedom of assembly.
   ``And that's what we're doing,'' he said. ``I do not think that
we should in any way be seen to be somehow inciting to riot and I
think that we have to be appropriate in our response.''
   He said a news blackout declared by the government was
``regrettable. We wish that that had not been done. We continue to
urge restraint in the situation overall.''
   Baker said it was too premature to conclude that developments in
China have strengthened the hand of hardliners led by Premier Li
Peng.
   ``It's a little bit unclear exactly what the situation is as
between the hardliners on the one hand and those who profess to
support more openness on the other,'' the secretary said.
   ``I think we simply have to wait and see,'' he added. ``I do
think it's fair to say that the situation is unclear and there is a
certain degree of flux.''
   Asked how the United States would view a harsh crackdown on the
students, Baker said, ``that's a very hypothetical qeustion ...
that you can obviously understand why I wouldn't respond to.''
   President Bush's spokesman Marlin Fitzwater offered words of
support for the student-led demonstrations, saying, ``The United
States stands for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
   ``The demonstrations of the last few days indicate that the
hunger for change remains strong,'' said Fitzwater, with Bush on a
trip to his seaside home.
   The spokesman said the chief executive had received an update on
events in China during his morning intelligence briefing.
   Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney told reporters in
Cheyenne, Wyo., ``There is very little the United States can do
from a military standpoint and very little the United States would
want to do from a military standpoint'' regarding the situation in
China.
   In Washington, a State Department monitoring group was keeping
tabs on developments in China.
   The State Department also expressed concern about the news
blackout imposed by Chinese authorities.
   ``We are concerned over the interruption of the free flow of
information from Beijing, which has occurred over the past day. We
hope the progress the Chinese have made in recent years will be
sustained and further advanced,'' the agency said.
   ``The situation remains uncertain,'' Fitzwater said. ``Both
sides have exercised restraint and we urge that restraint to
continue. We remain hopeful that a dialogue between the government
and the students is possible.''
   Friday evening, Fitzwater called the blackout ``very
disturbing.''
   ``We urge that it not signal an end to appropriate restraint or
an end to dialogue with the students,'' the spokesman said.
   With martial law declared in some parts of the capital, Beijing
Mayor Chen Xitong said foreign reporters were forbidden to conduct
interviews or make tapes or videos on the streets or at government
offices, schools, factories and mines.

<HEAD>Two Picasso Works Stolen From Sao Paulo Gallery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thieves stole two Picasso works
valued at more than $100,000 from an art gallery in Sao Paulo, it
was reported Saturday.
   Horacio Penteado, director of the Association of Friends of
Modern Art, said an etching and a ceramic figure were stolen early
Friday from the downtown gallery and he valued each at more than
$50,000.
   ``There were no signs of forced entry,'' he said. ``Obviously
someone who had previous access to the gallery did the job.''
   Panteado identified the mising objects as the etching ``Goat's
Head on a Table'' and the ceramic figure ``The Dove.'' He said they
were completed in the 1940s by Pablo Picasso and given to the art
association in the 1950s by Count Francesco Matarazzo, a Brazilian
millionaire.
   The 23-inch by 31-inch black-and-white etching was cut from its
frame, according to Penteado. He said ``The Dove'' was 12 inches
tall.
   Both works were partially insured, he said, and the gallery
``probably would receive just half their value.''
   He said the objects were in the gallery's 80-piece collection of
20th century art.
   The Spanish painter and sculptor, a pioneer in cubism, died in
1973.

<HEAD>Report Four Indian Soldiers, Seven Tamils Killed</HEAD>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Four Indian soldiers were among 11
people killed in a mine explosion, assassination and mob violence
in the past 24 hours, officials and other sources reported Saturday.
   But none of the attacks was blamed on members of the People's
Liberation Front, an organization of militant Sinhalese battling
both Tamil separatists and the predominantly Sinhalese government.
   The People's Liberation Front on Friday declared a three-day
cease-fire for the Vesak festival honoring Buddha. No violence was
reported in central and southern Sri Lanka, which are populated
mainly by Sinhalese.
   These deaths were reported in Tamil dominated zones in northern
and eastern Sri Lanka:
   A land mine blew up an Indian army truck in a village near the
town of Vavuniya, 135 miles northeast of Colombo, killing four
soldiers. Surviving troopers shot and killed a Tamil rebel.
   The Indian High Commission also said Indian soldiers found the
bodies of three adults and an infant near the port city of
Trincomalee 147 miles northeast of Colombo. It said local residents
told the soldiers the victims were Tamils who were killed by a
Sinhalese mob.
   The High Commission said Indian troopers killed a Tamil Tiger
guerrilla in Vavuniya early Saturday.
   Vavuniya residents, contacted by telephone, said Tamil Tiger
guerrillas assassinated a member of the rival Eelam People's
Revolutionary Liberation Front.
   At least 9,000 people have been killed since Tamil rebels began
fighting six years ago for their own homeland in northeastern Sri
Lanka, an island off southern India.
   It is estimated that militants of the People's Liberation Front
have killed 3,500 Sinhalese who served or supported the government.
   The People's Liberation Front began its deadly campaign after
the government's attempt in 1987 to negotiate peace with the Tamil
rebels.
   Sinhalese militants accused the government of making too many
concessions to the Tamil minority.
   India, the broker in the 1987 peace plan, sent troops to Sri
Lanka to help disarm Tamil rebels but they became the targets of
attacks.
   Most Tamils are Hindus and they compose about 18 percent of the
Island's population of 16 million. The Buddhist Sinhalese make up
75 percent.

<HEAD>Credit Union Formed to Help Poor May Have Financed Lavish Lifestyle</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>OMAHA, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of a failed credit union has been
portrayed by authorities as a reverse Robin Hood who diverted
millions of dollars of deposits from the poor to fund a lavish
lifestyle of parties and private jets.
   Lawrence E. King Jr., a flamboyant Republican Party activist who
once ran up a $1.1 million American Express bill, was released
Friday on his own recognizance after being charged in a 40-count
federal indictment accusing him of fraud and violating income tax
law.
   King's wife, Alice, who faces 12 federal counts, also was
released on her own recognizance by U.S. Magistrate Richard Kopf.
Both were scheduled for Tuesday court appearances.
   Last November, the National Credit Union Administration shut
down King's Franklin Community Federal Credit Union and filed a
civil lawsuit, saying that as much as $39 million was missing from
Franklin coffers.
   The victims were not only neighborhood depositors who used the
credit union for their small accounts, but businesses and even
convents in North Dakota and South Dakota who invested.
   King, 44, owned restaurants and bars in Omaha and had a home
near embassy row in Washington, D.C. He chartered jets and
limousines. He wore expensive clothing and jewelry, including a
$69,000 watch seized when a judge ordered King's property into
receivership.
   King declined to comment on the indictment Friday, but has
denied any wrongdoing in the past. Calls to his residence Saturday
were forwarded to his catering business and an employee there said
he was out and declined to take a message.
   Friends and associates describe King as a generous man who
donated to community projects and AIDS research.
   King, who is black and a one-time Democrat, said he became a
Republican because blacks need ``to be on both sides of the
bargaining table.''
   He sang the National Anthem at the 1984 Republican National
Convention in Dallas and threw extravagant parties, including one
at the Southfork Ranch where the television show ``Dallas'' is
filmed. Last year, King spent $100,000 for parties at the GOP
Convention in New Orleans, according to court documents.
   Government documents allege he used credit union funds to make
more than $40,000 in political contributions to Republican
candidates and causes.
   King's affluent lifestyle caused some high-ranking Nebraska
Republicans, including Gov. Kay Orr, to keep their distance.
   Mrs. Orr received a $2,250 campaign donation from King, but
later balked at his offer to be the host of a fund-raiser.
   ``We couldn't figure out where his money was coming from,'' said
George Spence, Mrs. Orr's finance director.
   In a November letter to King, assistant U.S. attorney Thomas
Thalken said the grand jury investigation into Franklin's collapse
included allegations of false entries, mail fraud, wire fraud and
federal tax violations.
   Thalken said the probe also centered on violations involving the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. RICO contains
criminal and civil provisions aimed at racketeering and organized
crime.
   Court documents said King sold millions of dollars of purported
certificates of deposit at above-market rates.
   He ``committed a long series of fraudulent, dishonest and
illegal acts by which funds were transferred from (the credit
union) to himself,'' other people and entities, the government
alleged.
   During a 13-month period in 1987 and 1988, he made $32,120 in
Republican campaign contributions, according to government
documents.
   The biggest single contribution, $25,350, was to Citizens For
America, a lobbying group for President Reagan's economic and
defense policies.
   Documents show King also gave money to Americans for Bush, Jack
Kemp for president, Robert Dole for president, the Republican
National Committee and the National Black Republican Council.
   Because deposits are insured up to $100,000, most neighborhood
investors have been reimbursed by the government. But some groups
exceeded the $100,000 limit.
   Charities held about $8 million in Franklin deposits,
investigators said.
   The Sisters of the Presentation of the Blessed Virgin Mary in
Aberdeen, S.D., had $2 million in the credit union. Other investors
included the American Baptist Church USA and the Presbyterian
Church USA.
   The indictment opened Friday named King in 40 counts on charges
of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, bank fraud, credit union
embezzlement, making false entries in credit union records and
filing false tax returns.
   The indictment accused Mrs. King in 12 counts for alleged
conspiracy, wire fraud and bank fraud.
   If convicted on all counts, King faces up to 200 years in prison
and fines totaling $10 million. Mrs. King, 42, faces up to 60 years
in prison and $3 million in fines.

   Sunday Silence, the Kentucky Derby winner, won
a photo-finish duel with Easy Goer by a nose on Saturday to win the
$674,200 Preakness at Pimlico and a chance at horse racing's first
Triple Crown since 1978.
   No horse has won the Derby, Preakness and the Belmont Stakes
since Affirmed won all three races in 1978.
   Sunday Silence and Easy Goer, the beaten favorite in the
Kentucky Derby and the favorite again Saturday, ran
eyeball-to-eyeball in the stretch as the crowd screamed itself
hoarse. At the wire, Sunday Silence won by a nose.
   Before the victory became official, the stewards deliberated a
foul claim filed against Sunday Silence and jockey Pat Valenzuela
by Pat Day, who rode Easy Goer.
   Easy Goer finished five lengths in front of Rock Point, who was
two lengths ahead of Dansil. Completing the order of finish were
Hawkster, Houston, Pulverizing and Northern Wolf.
   Sunday Silence carried 126 pounds over the 1 3-16 miles in 1:53
4-5, the third fastest time of the 114 Preaknesses.
   The winner paid $6.20, $3 and $3.20, unbeaten in four starts as
a 3-year-old. His next race will be the 1{-mile Belmont Stakes June
10 at Belmont Park. Easy Goer paid $2.40 and $2.40 while Rock Point
was $3.60 to show.

   While their husbands discussed world
affairs Saturday, first ladies Barbara Bush and Danielle Mitterrand
enjoyed a yacht cruise around Casco Bay and a tour of the Portland
Museum of Art.
   ``We're having the best time. Perfect weather,'' Mrs. Bush said
as she boarded the 52-foot ``Love Dove,'' a privately owned yacht
that was chartered for the tour.
   The first ladies had a private lunch of seafood with about a
dozen guests at a residence in Cape Elizabeth, followed by a
45-minute cruise around the Casco Bay islands and the famous
Portland Headlight _ a lighthouse _ and they ended the day with a
guided tour of the art museum.
   French President Francois Mitterand and President Bush spent the
day discussing NATO issues at the Bush estate in Kennebunkport.
   The women did not entertain questions from reporters, but museum
Director Barbara Nasanow said Mrs. Mitterand ``really was taken
with the (Winslow) Homer watercolors. She just thought he was a
master of the technique.''
   Mrs. Mitterand also spent several minutes admiring French
artifacts that the French people gave to Maine in 1949 as gratitude
for America's help during World War II.
   The museum was designed by American architect I.M. Pei, who also
designed the new glass pyramid that caps the entrance to the Louvre
museum in Paris.
   Dorothy Bush LeBlond, the president's daughter, said that in
arranging the day's activities for the group, she and her mother
``tried to think of what's special in Maine.''
   So she began the day with a Maine lunch at the home of a friend,
Betsy Hunt of Cape Elizabeth, who served grilled scallops, tiger
shrimp with champagne, and asparagus raspberry salad, with a desert
of chocolate mousse torte topped with fresh strawberry sauce.
   Then it was on to the Channel Crossing dock in South Portland,
where the bejeweled women, dressed in skirts and high heels,
boarded the yacht for a cruise under sunny, cloudless skies,
followed by the museum tour.
   ``We're very proud of this museum,'' Mrs. LeBlond said, ``so we
wanted them to see that.''
   Small crowds at each stop craned to see the first ladies.
   ``We didn't know they were coming. It's a real treat,'' said
Nancy Maggs of Bar Mills, who was visiting friends on another boat
with her husband, Charles.

   Three days of rain-triggered
mudslides have killed 58 people and left more than 3,500 homeless
in the northeastern city of Salvador, rescue officials said
Saturday.
   Rescue teams on Saturday identified 21 more victims drowned or
buried alive in mudslides in this coastal city of 1.8 million
people, Civil Defense spokeswoman Emilia Vasconcelos said by
telephone from the region.
   Salvador is 1,055 miles northeast of Rio de Janeiro.
   Ms. Vasconcelos said two couples were found completely smothered
in their cars after a hill collapsed and swamped a nearby motel and
a row of homes Friday morning in the city's Lobato district.
   Rains forced the hillside to give way, releasing a wave of mud
that ripped through a concrete wall alongside the hotel, crushed a
row of homes and smothered the cars, she said.
   The fire department also found another 16 people buried in
mudslides in various parts of the city and another person who
drowned in a park, she said.
   Torrential rains and high winds knocked out power lines and
blacked out several of the city's outlying districts. Sewage
systems and water networks were completely destroyed in some areas,
Ms. Vasconcelos said.
   She said more than 3,500 people lost their homes to flood waters
and mudslides since Thursday and were being sheltered in schools,
churches and a soccer stadium.
   A state of emergency declared Thursday by Salvador Mayor
Fernando Jose remained in effect, she said. Heavy rain was forecast
for Sunday.
   TV film footage showed streets covered in chest-high water,
helmeted firemen helping slum residents pull mud-covered bodies
from flattened huts and cranes gouging into high mounds of earth at
the base of collapsed hills.
   Fire Chief Carlos Santos de Andrade said the rescue force,
nearly doubled to 150 workers, would search around the clock for
more victims.
   ``In the periphery of the city, everything is falling apart,''
said de Andrade. ``The high, hilly areas could collapse at any
moment.''

   Scattered thunderstorms boomed over the South on Saturday with
heavy rain, hail as big as golf balls and winds up to 56 mph that
uprooted trees in North Carolina.
   Scattered showers fell across the Great Lakes region and the
central Appalachians, sections of Texas again experienced heat and
humidity, and skies were partly cloudy along the East Coast.
   Sunny skies and mild temperatures extended from the northern and
central Rockies to the northern half of the Great Plains and the
upper Mississippi Valley, and dry weather prevailed in the western
third of the nation.
   In western North Carolina, thunderstorm winds uprooted large
trees in Texana and dime-size hail fell in Murphy.
   In Memphis, Tenn., a thunderstorm dropped hail as big as golf
balls and winds gusted to 56 mph at the Memphis Naval Air Station.
   Three to 5 inches of rain fell in east central Oklahoma, and
locally heavy rain fell on the Florida Panhandle. A flash flood
watch was in effect in southern Oklahoma.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 2.25 inches in Valparaiso, Fla.; more than an inch in
Birmingham, Ala.; and more than three-fourths of an inch in
Huntsville and Muscle Shoals, Ala.
   In south central and southwest Texas, temperatures were in the
mid-90s and the relative humidity was around 50 percent. The heat
index was 109 in Laredo and 107 in Cotulla and Beeville.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 48
degrees in Yellowstone National Park, Wyo., to 99 degrees at Palm
Springs, Calif. The nation's low Saturday morning was 21 degrees in
Jackson, Wyo.
   The forecast for Sunday called for showers and thunderstorms
from the central and southern Plains to the lower half of the
Mississippi Valley, the Tennessee Valley, the Gulf Coast states and
much of Florida, with storms most numerous over Missouri and
Arkansas; showers and thunderstorms in New York, New England and
along the coast of the middle and south Atlantic Coast states; and
rain along the Washington and Oregon coasts.
   High temperatures were predicted in the 60s along the California
coast, from the Pacific Northwest to northwest Montana, and in
upper Michigan; around 90 degrees in parts of Florida, Mississippi
and Louisiana; in the 90s in most of Texas and New Mexico; 95 to
105 degrees along Texas' Rio Grande Valley and in the desert
Southwest; and in the 70s and 80s elsewhere.

<HEAD>Newspaper Reports Powder Used On Iowa May Have Been Mishandled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Powder used in the USS Iowa's gun turrets,
where an explosion killed 47 sailors, may have been stored at
dangerously high temperatures before it was loaded aboard, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
   Cannon charges were stored in uncooled barges on the York River
last summer while the battleship was undergoing repairs, according
to The Virginian-Pilot and The Ledger-Star.
   Exposure to such heat dangerously accelerates the decomposition
of chemicals used to keep the charges stable, according to a Navy
manual. On board the ship, the powder is kept in cooled magazines.
   The newspaper said unidentified Navy sources with knowledge of
the investigation into the April 19 tragedy confirmed that
investigators were looking at how the powder was handled at the
Yorktown Naval Weapons Station.
   Storage was ``not, as I understand it, in accordance with all of
the provisions for appropriate storage,'' an unidentified spokesman
for the Naval Sea Systems Command, which oversees Navy shipyards
and weapons depots, told the newspaper.
   Navy spokesmen were not available for comment Saturday at the
Pentagon and the Naval Air Force's Atlantic Fleet headquarters in
Norfolk.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified sources discussing
preliminary investigation results, said the 110-pound bags of
powder sat on three barges at piers on the York from mid-April to
mid-September 1988.
   There was no monitoring of temperatures aboard the barges, but
station personnel estimated they exceeded air temperatures by 25
degrees. Air temperatures were 90 degrees or higher for 43 days
during the storage period, according to the National Weather
Service.
   The stabilizer used to keep the charges safe begins to decompose
at temperatures higher than 70 degrees, according to the Naval Sea
Systems Command OP-5 manual, the Navy's bible on the care and
handling of munitiions. Decomposition reaches a relatively high
rate above 100 degrees and is dangerously accelerated at
temperatures above 110 degrees.
   The 16-inch guns of the Iowa-class battleships use up to six of
the 110-pound silk bags of propellant, commonly called powder, to
shoot a shell weighing as much as a small car more than 23 miles.
   The propellant was manufactured during World War II and the
Korean War. There are no companies making such charges now, the
Navy said.
   When the Navy began reactivating the battleships in the 1980s,
some powder was disposed of because of deterioration. The rest was
reblended to eliminate any ``hot spots,'' the newspaper said. The
reblended propellant was closely monitored, the Navy said.
   The service is testing powder that survived the explosion and is
trying to determine what temperatures it may have been subjected to
last summer and in what condition it was returned to the ship, the
newspaper quoted an unidentified Navy official as saying.
   Munitions experts said unstable powder will either be quite
volatile or will fail to ignite. Sailors aboard the Iowa have said
that minutes before the explosion in turret No. 2, a gun in turret
No. 1 failed to fire after repeated attempts.
   The Navy has said the misfire was unrelated to the explosion,
and that the charges came from different batches of powder and were
of different types.
   The Navy was unable to say Friday whether both batches had been
subjected to the same high temperatures on the barges, the
newspaper said.

<TEXT>
   A blaze damaged a supermarket and
warehouse Saturday, the fire department said, and a caller claimed
it was set to protest the sale of fish from Iceland, which hunts
whales despite international opposition.
   The Nottinghamshire fire department said it knew of no one
injured in the fire, although 21 workers were reported in the
bakery and warehouse in Carlton, near Nottingham in central
England, when it broke out. More than 40 firefighters fought the
blaze.
   The fire caused an estimated $810,000 in damage to the Tesco
chain store, including all the stock in the warehouse.
   Later, a caller to a British Broadcasting Corp. radio station
claimed responsibility for the blaze, saying it was in protest over
Tesco's policy of stocking Icelandic fish.
   The environmental group Greenpeace, which has protested Tesco's
policy of buying Icelandic fish because of Iceland's whale
industry, condemned the attack. A spokesman said Greenpeace was not
involved.
   The International Whaling Commission has declared a moratorium
on the killing of whales to preserve their diminishing numbers. But
Iceland continues what it calls ``scientific whaling'' _ taking a
limited number of whales for scientific research but selling the
meat as well.
   Critics, saying the program camouflages commercial whaling, have
called for a boycott of Icelandic fish. Fishing is Iceland's
primary industry.

   Former Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos
remained in very critical condition Saturday as he drifted in and
out of consciousness from a variety of serious ailments, a hospital
administrator said.
   Marcos, 71, is suffering from kidney and heart failure,
pneumonia and bacterial infections.
   ``Marcos' physicians indicated he is continuing to rally,'' said
Eugene Tiwanak, assistant administrator at St. Francis Medical
Center in a briefing Saturday.
   ``The doctors stress, however, that his condition remains very
critical and the prognosis is poor,'' he said.
   The deposed president was more responsive Saturday than on
Friday, Tiwanak said.
   ``He's alert enough to understand and follow instructions
relative to his care,'' and communicates through hand signals
because a tube in his throat prevents him from speaking, he said.
   Marcos is hooked up to a kidney dialysis machine and is on a
respirator to help him breathe, Tiwanak said.
   Marcos, who has lived here since being ousted in a popular
revolt in 1986, has been hospitalized since Jan. 15, and was
returned to the intensive care unit early last week.
   ``It is very serious, but he's hanging on,'' his wife, Imelda
Marcos, said during a visit to the hospital Friday.
   Mrs. Marcos was joined by about 100 friends and supporters for a
prayer service in the hospital chapel Friday night.
   She said Marcos was able to smile when visited by their
daughter, Irene, who went to the hospital after arriving from
California. He puckered his lips and threw her a kiss.
   In the Philippines, about 1,000 Marcos supporters marched
Saturday near the presidential palace to demand his return.
   His successor, President Corazon Aquino, on Friday refused to
allow Marcos to return from exile and said her government will not
permit him to be buried in the Philippines despite ``a last
appeal'' from his wife.
   Mrs. Aquino conferred Saturday with five Cabinet members about
Marcos' health, and afterward officials said the ban on the former
president's return _ dead or alive _ still stands.
   Marcos ruled the Philippines for 20 years, many of them under
martial law. After his departure there were several foiled coup
attempts by people linked to Marcos.
   The Marcoses are under a U.S. indictment accusing them of
stealing more than $100 million from the Philippine treasury to buy
art and real estate in New York. In April a judge ruled that Marcos
was too ill to stand trial and suspended the charges, but Mrs.
Marcos still faces trial. She is free on $5 million bail.

<HEAD>President To Extend Wage-Price Freeze</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will
extend wage and price controls beyond the July 31 expiration date,
newspapers said Saturday.
   They reported Salinas said Friday the controls must remain in
force to ensure improved living standards for workers.
   The controls went into effect in February 1988 after prices
soared 159.2 in 1987. Inflation was reduced to 51.7 percent last
year.
   Under an agreement, the government pledged to curb spending,
labor to hold down wage demands and business to freeze prices.
   Newspapers did not indicate how long the extension might last,
but some business leaders said they thought it would remain in
effect through the end of the year.
   Salinas, addressing a union conference, also spoke about opening
the Mexican economy to foreign investments, according to the
papers. He was quoted as saying, ``We will pursue the changes that
are indispensible to put Mexico in the vanguard of modernizing
countries.''
   The newspapers also said Finance Minister Pedro Aspe defended
the government's decision last week to encourage foreign
investments.
   They reported he suggested other Latin American nations also
should open their economies to outside investments along with
renegotiating their debt burdens.
   Mexico's foreign debt is $107.4 billion.
   On Wednesday, Aspe announced a $1.96 billion package of loans to
Mexico by the World Bank. The money is to be used for public
projects and to reduce interest payments on the debt.
   On Monday, Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche announced new
foreign investment regulations that open some sectors of the
economy that had been sheltered for years and increases the amount
of foreign ownership allowed in other sectors.

   A man described as a paranoid drug user
sent his common-law wife to buy cigarettes, then shot and killed
four children and himself in their home Saturday morning, police
said.
   Police tactical unit officers found the body of John Andrew
Dubbin, 31, and those of the children, ranging in age from 1 to 7,
in the living room of a garage that had been converted into a house
in a working-class neighborhood.
   ``It's from hell in there,'' police Lt. Bill Mattei said after
SWAT team members stormed the house.
   The children were identified as Elizabeth Ann Dubbin, 2, and
Albert Michael Dubbin, 1, the daughter and son of Dubbin and his
common-law wife, Elizabeth Mahannah, and Heather Lynn Mahannah, 7,
and Christina Marie Mahannah, 4, Ms. Mahannah's daughters by
another man, a police statement said.
   Each of the children appeared to have been shot once with a
16-gauge shotgun, said Capt. Tony Lanata, head of the homicide
squad. The children were dressed in their bed clothing, said Mike
Elkins, a homicide detective.
   SWAT officers tossed tear gas into the house and entered it
after repeated attempts to communicate with the occupants failed,
said SWAT team commander Lt. Richard Morgan.
   ``We even knocked a window out and threw a phone in there to try
to get him (Dubbin) to come to the phone,'' Morgan said. ``I was
under the impression that I needed to do something in case there
were injured in there that needed aid ... so the assault team went
in.''
   SWAT team members shot and killed a dog that attacked them as
they entered the home, Morgan said.
   Ms. Mahannah called police from outside the house after she
returned from buying cigarettes and found Dubbin and the children
locked in the house, police said.
   ``The wife stated that her husband was very paranoid ... and
that he had fired his shotgun in the house about 5 a.m., thinking
the SWAT was coming to get him,'' said SWAT team commander Lt.
Richard Morgan. He said Ms. Mahannah also described her husband as
a user of cocaine and other drugs.
   Dubbin had been convicted for resisting arrest, burglary and
criminal damaging, Morgan said.
   Neighbors said they knew little about Dubbin, who had lived in
the area only a few months.

<TEXT>
   The three top opposition leaders
defied a ban on rallies and marched through the streets on
Saturday, their first public appearance since they were attacked
and beaten 10 days ago.
   Presidential candidate Guillermo Endara and vice presidential
candidates Ricardo Arias Calderon and Guillermo Ford were assaulted
by paramilitary forces supporting Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega on
May 10.
   That was the day the government, controlled by Noriega, the
Defense Forces chief, annulled the May 7 election.
   Independent observers say the opposition candidates were leading
the Noriega-picked government candidates in the national election
when Noriega's troopers seized election ballots.
   The government on Saturday prohibited ``marches, meetings,
public demonstrations or caravans of vehicles'' by any political
organization until at least June 5.
   ``The prohibition does not have any meaning to us,'' Endara said
as he wended through an outdoor market on this capital's eastern
outskirts. The stop was one of six made by a caravan of about 20
vehicles.
   The motorcade briefly blocked traffic on some major arteries
leading into the capital. Police watched but took no action.
   At one point the candidates met with Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa.,
who headed a delegation named by President Bush to observe the May
7 election. The delegation claimed Endara won the election.
   In a departure statement at the Howard Air Force Base, Murtha
said he had returned to Panama Saturday morning to inspect
conditions at American bases, confer with U. S. Embassy officials
and meet with opposition leaders and Archbishop Marcos McGrath, the
Roman Catholic primate of Panama.
   Murtha, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, indirectly
urged the Panamanian Defense Forces to move against Noriega.
   President Bush ``is not interested in punishing the PDF,''
Murtha said. ``He is interested in dealing with the PDF. The target
of our dismay is the leader of the PDF.''
   Murtha refused comment when asked if he had spoken to any
Defense Forces officers.
   Endara said the caravan was designed ``to thank the people for
their support May 7.''
   Ford said the action was intended ``to reconstruct the
confidence of the people in order to make another push.''
   The tour had all the trappings of a classic campaign swing, with
much kissing of babies, hand-pumping and shouts of ``Viva nuestro
presidente!'' or ``Long live our president!''
   A vendor at the Rio Abajo market shouted of Endara: ``He's the
true president of Panama!''
   The Ministry of Government and Justice issued a communique
saying the prohibition on demonstrations was in response to the
imminent visit by delegates from the Organization of American
States.
   The foreign ministers of Ecuador, Guatemala, Trinidad and
Tobago, accompanied by OAS Secretary-General Joao Baena Soares, are
due in Panama on Tuesday. They will try to promote resolution of
Panama's 15-month-old government crisis.
   The organization on Wednesday approved a resolution critical of
Noriega.
   The government said the prohibition of political street activity
was imposed to comply with the clause in the OAS resolution calling
on ``the authorities and all political forces in Panama to abstain
from any measure or action that could aggravate the crisis.''
   The United States has been trying to oust Noriega since February
1988, when he was indicted on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
Noriega has survived economic sanctions and international pressure,
accusing the United States of seeking to scrap a treaty that will
give Panama full control and supervision of the Panama Canal by the
end of the century.

<TEXT>
   South Africa will reduce its military
force in Namibia to 1,500 soldiers by June 24, an army commander
said Saturday.
   That is a week earlier than the July 1 date set in the U.N. plan
to bring independence to the territory, also known as South-West
Africa.
   Maj. Gen. Willie Meyer, commander of South African forces in
Namibia, said he had ordered the phased troop withdrawal to proceed
at a pace that would leave only 1,500 soldiers in the territory by
June 24 and they would be confined to two designated bases.
   South Africa has not said how many soldiers it has in Namibia,
but it should now be under 12,000 according to the U.N. timetable.
   On Friday, a South African, Cuban and Angolan commission
announced that South African troops and guerrillas of the
South-West Africa People's Organization had ceased hostilities and
returned to their bases, clearing the way for resumption of the
independence process.
   Delegations of the three countries, joined by Soviet and U.S.
observers, said after a meeting in southern Angola they had
received confirmation that South African forces had returned to
their bases in Namibia and SWAPO guerrillas were back in bases in
Angola.
   The three nations agreed in December to the U.N. independence
plan that calls for elections in Namibia in November. The plan
includes the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola where they
helped the Marxist government fight anti-communist rebels.
   The process was interrupted April 1, the day it started, when
hundreds of SWAPO guerrillas crossed into Namibia from Angola.
   South African forces left their bases to block the incursion and
Namibian officials reported 316 guerrillas and 27 security force
members were killed in the subsequent fighting.
   Under the U.N. plan, the guerrillas, who have been fighting for
independence for 23 years, will be allowed to return to Namibia,
unarmed, to participate in the elections.
   South Africa has administered Namibia, a former German
possession, since the end of World War I.

   Betty Irwin remembers the time in high school
when Gilda Radner acted like Chevy Chase, her prat-falling partner
on ``Saturday Night Live.''
   ``There was a play once, `The Mouse That Roared,''' said Irwin,
a classmate and friend of Radner's at The Liggett School in Grosse
Pointe. ``She was upstairs in the dressing room trying to get
dressed. Lee Jenkins was the queen (on stage). Gilda lost her
balance and literally rolled down the stairs and onto the stage.
   ``She began ad-libbing right away. Her and Lee Jenkins just
bounced off one another. Lee sort of said, `Well, she always was a
little clumsy.'
   ``The teacher behind the stage was just having a fit because she
couldn't follow the script. It was really cute.''
   The rest, as they say, was history. Miss Radner went on to
become an Emmy Award-winning star of NBC-TV's ``Saturday Night
Live.'' She died of cancer Saturday in Los Angeles at age 42.
   Miss Radner's talents were rooted deep in her Detroit-area
upbringing, from her skills as a writer and stage performer to her
hospital volunteer work.
   Born in Detroit, Miss Radner attended the all-girls Liggett
school and graduated in 1964. Eighteen members of the 24-member
graduating class held their 25th reunion party two weeks ago.
   ``We all knew Gilda was in the hospital,'' Irwin said. ``I know
if Gilda would have been up to it, she would have been here. We
videotaped (the reunion) but we couldn't get it to her in time. She
had gone into a coma before we could get it out.
   ``We really missed her, and we didn't know she was as bad as she
was.''
   In her freshman year, Miss Radner performed with her school
choir with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra at Ford Auditorium.
   In her junior year, she transferred to Detroit Mumford High
School and also worked as a volunteer at Sinai Hospital.
   ``Actually I was going to teach retarded kids. I used to work
with the emotionally disturbed in Detroit,'' she said in a New York
Daily News interview in 1977.
   She returned to Liggett for her senior year, then enrolled at
the University of Michigan as a drama student.
   ``Her sense of humor was constant and engaging. When she was a
student in Ann Arbor, we sort of got a free `Saturday Night Live'
every day because of that bubbling attitude toward life, and it was
original,'' said retired University of Michigan Professor Richard
Burgwin.
   ``It was a wonderful fountain of wit and joy,'' he said in a
telephone interview from his home in Bradenton, Fla.
   Radner quit school in 1969, he said.
   ``I think she was bored, quite frankly,'' Burgwin said. ``There
are performers who need and want training, and there are others who
are themselves and ready to go. I think Gilda made the right
judgment, what we had to give was not what she needed.''

<HEAD>President Says Coup Leaders Committed Suicide</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam
said Saturday that three generals who joined in a coup attempt had
killed themselves rather than surrender.
   It initially was reported the three were among officers killed
by loyal soldiers during the attempted coup that began Tuesday.
   Mengistu did not name the generals he said had committed
suicide, but spoke of them as ``agents of our detractors.''
   Mengistu spoke at a rally in downtown Addis Ababa in his first
public appearance since announcing on radio and television Thursday
that the coup had been crushed.
   He told the rally, ``Our detractors and their accomplices never
spared a moment to sow confusion and uncertainity by alleging that
we have failed to achieve immediate results in our endeavors.''
   Diplomatic sources said nearly the entire high command,
including six rebellious generals, were killed during the attempt
to overthrow the government.
   They said the revolt was led by generals humiliated by recent
defeats in Ertirea and Tigre provinces in northern Ethiopia where
different guerrilla forces are fighting for autonomy.
   The revolt began a few hours after Mengistu left for a visit to
East Germany. He hurried back Wednesday to face the biggest crisis
of his 15-year-old Marxist government.
   It was reported Tuesday that Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, the chief
of staff, and Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, the air force commander, were
killed in the revolt.
   The diplomatic sources said Friday that loyalist troops killed
Maj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, commander of the 2nd Army with
headquarters in Asmara, the capital Eritrea.
   The 150,000-strong 2nd Army, with nearly half of the country's
entire armed forces, had been split into rival factions, according
to the diplomatic sources.
   Mengistu and other officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on
Sept. 12, 1974.
   Addis Ababa was calm Saturday although tanks and armored
vehicles remained stationed at strategic buildings. There was no
information about the situation in the rest of the country.

   A rally marking the 20th anniversary of
the People's Park occupation turned into a violent clash with
police reminiscent of one of the bloodiest riots of the 1960s.
Twelve people were arrested.
   Fifteen police officers were injured during the riot Friday
night and Saturday morning near the University of California at
Berkeley, including one who was hit over the head with a bottle,
said police spokesman David Anderson. None, however, was
hospitalized. Two firefighters also suffered minor injuries.
   About 70 Berkeley and 30 university police scuffled with
combatants in a crowd of about 1,000 as piles of trash were
gathered and torched and looters smashed store windows, then fled
with merchandise.
   At least 28 businesses were damaged during the violence, but no
dollar estimate was immediately available, Anderson said. No other
injuries were reported.
   Two Berkeley fire department vehicles were overturned and one
was set one fire, said Anderson, who estimated the damage at about
$40,000. Another fire engine was vandalized while responding to a
fire at an intersection in the middle of the riot.
   The scene was an eerie replay of the 1969 clashes whose focus
was the 2.3-acre university-owned lot that the university had
targeted for housing. Activists wanted to turn it into a park, and
the dispute came to embody all that the two sides hated about each
other during that protest-filled decade.
   But this weekend's violence seemed oddly out of context.
   ``What started here tonight was something that began as a social
protest but it quickly degenerated into just plain vandalism,''
University of California student David Brooks, 19, said Friday
night.
   The rally started about 10 p.m. and broke up about an hour
later, but the crowd gathered again and smashed windows and looted
about a dozen stores in the nearby business district. Most of the
action was about a half-block from the park and some three blocks
from the UC campus.
   ``I thought that People's Park was all about creating peace, but
these riots have no place in the peace movement,'' said Julia
Tolley, who stood outside a boutique with her boyfriend, Rusty
Pacatte, owner of the store.
   The couple said several thousand dollars in merchandise were
stolen from the store, which carries expensive household
furnishings and clothing.
   The same Bank of America branch that became a regular activist
target in the 1960s was struck again by an arsonist.
   ``He lit a paper bag on fire and stuck his hand through a broken
window,'' said 17-year-old Greta Salmonson. ``It took a few minutes
and then the flames started coming up.''
   Some of the crowd tried to put out the fire, said 24-year-old
political science major Blake Marnell. The bank's carpeting and
paneling were scorched before Berkeley firefighters doused the
flames.
   Streets were littered with broken glass, capsized newspaper
racks and burning trash cans. A clothing store was trashed, and two
husky students stood guard in front of the store, trying to keep
looters from entering.
   Seven of those arrested were adults. Five were booked for
investigation of possession of stolen property, one for
investigation of assault with a deadly weapon and assault on a
police officer, and another for investigation of inciting a riot,
Anderson said.
   Five juveniles were arrested for investigation of possession of
stolen property, he said.
   People's Park has remained virtually untouched, an encampment
for the homeless, since activists occupied it a generation ago
after the university drew plans to erect student housing there.
   During the original occupation, gardens were planted in rolled
sod, tents went up and long-haired protesters moved in. The
university finally fenced the lot on May 15, 1969.
   When protesters tried to cut down the fence, they were met with
heavily armed sheriff's deputies, who peppered dozens of protesters
with birdshot. One man, James Rector, died a few days later. An
artist was blinded and two news reporters were among those who were
hurt.
   Then-Gov. Ronald Reagan sent 2,000 National Guard troops to
occupy the city for 17 days. A nightly curfew was imposed and
meetings of more than three people were banned. In the first week
after the riot, 1,000 people were arrested.
   In 1972, the university agreed to allow limited public access to
the still-vacant park. But it has never formally abandoned plans to
build student housing and recreational facilities at the site,
prompting some recent protests.

   European finance ministers on Saturday
hesitantly took their first steps toward forging common monetary
and economic policies.
   The finance chiefs of the 12 nations of the European Community
agreed to spell out the measures necessary for better coordination
among their governments.
   But they failed to embrace new proposals calling for sweeping
policy changes that would lead to a common currency and central
bank for the trading bloc.
   Britain has expressed opposition to the plan, saying it would
force countries to give up some of their sovereignty to new
institutions.
   ``It is, I think, very glib to assume that you can just go ahead
on this course...without making major changes on the political
front,'' Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, told
reporters.
   These, he said, ``are not changes which we are in any sense
ready to make.''
   Spain's finance minister, Carlos Solchaga, said the ministers
spoke at length and reached ``minimum agreement'' on the monetary
plan at their meeting in a luxury resort on Spain's Costa Brava.
   Dutch Finance Minister Onno Ruding described the discussion as
constructive. He said immediate progress should not be expected.
   The finance ministers, who arrived Friday, meet twice a year in
an informal setting to hash over financial and monetary issues.
   About 200 yards from the talks, about 100 protesters
demonstrated against military spending by the European countries.
   ``Military spending for social spending!'' they chanted.
   Leading off the ministers' agenda was a report released last
month that urged the nations to begin the move toward economic and
monetary union by July 1990.
   It is part of the drive to create a common European market by
the end of 1992. Such a goal would allow people, goods and capital
to move freely among the countries.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, the
community's executive body, led the 17-member committee that
drafted the monetary report.
   The committee's recommendations would require major changes in
the way in which the nations conduct economic and monetary policy.
The proposed changes were broken down into three phases.
   The ministers agreed community officials should set out what
needs to be done in the first stage, which generally calls for
greater policy coordination.
   They also want more details on the next two stages before
deciding whether to make changes in the Treaty of Rome, which sets
the legal foundation for the European-wide market in 1992.
   Delors insisted that if the governments make the initial moves
toward monetary union, they must complete the process.
   Not to do so, he said, would amount to ``one more failure on the
long road'' to economic and monetary union.
   Delors, asked about London's coolness to the monetary report,
noted there was an internal debate in Britain over European unity.
   He said he awaited a June summit of community leaders ``to make
a final assessment'' on Britain's views.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, often at odds with
Delors, has said the community's vision of unity would mean a
``superstate'' of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels.
   The ministers also welcomed a new proposal for smoothing their
widely varying value-added taxes, roughly like sales taxes in the
United States.
   Common Market members are: Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France,
Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands,
Portugal and Spain.

   Gang violence and drug peddling at a
housing project behind a junior high school show no signs of going
away, so officials are trying to make the campus bulletproof by
building a 10-foot high wall.
   Faculty and administrators wore T-shirts Friday bearing ``The
Great Wall of Lindbergh'' logo to show their enthusiasm for the
$160,000 project at Lindbergh Junior High School. It is scheduled
for completion in six weeks.
   Judy Wade, a physical education teacher, has said she's seen
beer bottles and even bicycle handlebars tossed at students during
her 25 years at the school. ``Now, it's not what they're throwing,
but what they're shooting,'' she said.
   Students were evacuated from the recreation fields twice during
one week in April because of gunfire. Two years ago, a student
playing basketball after school was hit in the chest by a bullet
that whizzed through a chain-link fence.
   ``They've had trouble there for as long as I can remember,''
said Principal Max Fraley, referring to the problem housing project
that is adjacent to the schoolyard. ``It is a very large area where
a lot of drug dealers congregate.''
   The concrete block wall will extend 300 yards along the school's
playground, separating the school and 1,200 students from the
713-unit Carmelitos Housing Project, Fraley said.
   Funds for the wall came from the city school district and Los
Angeles County after teacher Joan Reedy was nearly hit recently by
bullets as she walked with students to a softball diamond.
   ``Shots came through the fence and we heard the whizzing by,''
Ms. Reedy said. ``I was OK at first, but when I got home I was
scared. So I went to the Board of Education and said, `Something
needs to be done.'''
   Plans call for the wall to be bordered by shrubs and decorated
with a large mural, Fraley said.
   ``We'll use anti-graffiti paint, something that it will be easy
to wash the gang graffiti off of,'' he said.
   The mural will include a painting of the Spirit of St. Louis,
the airplane aviator Charles Linbergh flew in 1927 in the first
solo trans-Atlantic flight, and a large ``L'' overlapped by a
picture of an eagle, the school mascot.
   The slogan ``Lindbergh Leads the Way'' will top the mural
painted in school colors of blue and red.
   ``A 900-foot wall of this sort is significant because it
recognizes the problems we face today, and it will make everyone on
school grounds feel a lot safer,'' Fraley said.
   The principal said the student who was hit two years ago while
playing basketball is now in high school and still has the bullet
in him.
   ``The doctors said it would do more harm to take it out, and I'm
told he hasn't suffered any ill effects from it after he recovered
from the gunshot itself,'' Fraley said.
   ``The wall is terrific,'' said student Joe Trejo, 13, who lives
in the Carmelitos project next door. ``Why? Because I don't want to
get shot.''

   A new radar system installed in 1984
led the Coast Guard to stop plotting ship movements in the area
where the tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground, a Coast Guard commander
testified Saturday.
   But Cmdr. Steven McCall told federal investigators that the
change and a reduction in staff three years later did not
compromise tanker safety.
   McCall, the Coast Guard commander in Valdez, testified on the
fifth and final day of a National Transportation Board hearing on
the March 24 accident, which spilled nearly 11 million gallons of
oil into Prince William Sound.
   The NTSB panel _ which has heard testimony from Exxon
representatives, members of the tanker's crew, state officials and
others _ probably will not complete its report on the spill's cause
before January, said Chairman Lee Dickinson.
   The accident called into question the Coast Guard's ability to
monitor traffic in the sound. Tankers pick up North Slope crude oil
in Valdez, where the Alaska pipeline ends.
   Before 1984, the Coast Guard plotted ship movements on charts
using reports from vessels. The new radar system made that practice
unnecessary, McCall said.
   However, ship traffic controllers have testified that they could
not see the Exxon Valdez on radar before it ran aground, and had no
indication it was in trouble.
   The radar system has a range of up to 20 miles, but that varies
with the weather, McCall said.
   ``It's well within the realm of possibility that (the
controller) could have lost a reliable fix'' the night of the
accident, he said.
   The Coast Guard's traffic station in Valdez experienced some
staff cuts in 1987, and some staff members were reassigned, but
there were no major problems, McCall said.
   The commander confirmed that while the Exxon Valdez had Coast
Guard permission to cross the oncoming traffic lane, it did not
seek or receive permission to leave shipping lanes. Tanker crew
members have said they left the lanes to avoid ice, and
acknowledged permission had not been requested.
   Asked if he thought there was anything the Coast Guard station
could have done to prevent the accident, McCall said, ``No.''
   NTSB staff member Lou Colucciello suggested that the accident
might have been avoided if the Coast Guard had notified the tanker
it was outside shipping lanes.
   ``Presumably, they already knew that,'' McCall replied.
   Third Mate Gregory Cousins, who was in control of the ship at
the time of the accident despite not having proper certification,
has said he was aware it was outside shipping lanes.
   Arguments have raged over the response to the spill, which
stained more than 700 miles of Alaskan shoreline and killed
hundreds of animals, especially regarding the use of oil-dispersing
chemicals.
   McCall said there was no reason for him to take over the effort
to deal with the spill soon after it happened because equipment and
other resources were not on hand.
   The immediate response was handled by Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co., an oil industry consortium that manages the pipeline and the
Valdez marine terminal.
   McCall said using dispersants was discussed soon after the
accident early the morning of March 24. Tests of their
effectiveness were conducted late that afternoon or early that
evening, he said, adding that he didn't think there was
unreasonable delay in performing them.
   McCall said Alyeska did not have enough dispersant on hand to
significantly reduce damage by the spill, and that tests showed no
positive effect, possibly because oil on the water ``was still
pretty thick.''
   Exxon has said the oil would not have spread as much as it did
if state officials had promptly approved use of dispersants. Dennis
Kelso, Alaska's top state environmental official, responded that
permission had been granted before the spill and that Alyeska
didn't have enough dispersant for the job.
   During a break in Saturday's proceedings, Kelso attacked oil
industry testimony as ``revisionist history.'' The state's
representative at the hearings, Bob LeResche, said Friday that oil
industry officials lied under oath.
   At a news conference Saturday, Kelso said he would issue an
order or take other action soon to ensure that the oil industry
understands it must comply with its spill contingency plans.
   Kelso said Alyeska suggested in testimony Friday that its plan
represented optional guidelines.
   The Alaska Department of Law is reviewing the state's
enforcement options, including possibly closing the Alaska
pipeline, said Kelso, repeating a threat Gov. Steve Cowper made
soon after the spill.
   ``When it was in Alyeska's interest to say that they would do
the cleanup required by the plan, they promised to do so,'' Kelso
said. ``I think the American people are getting really tired of
hearing Exxon and Alyeska scrambling to hide from liability by
making up excuses for why they didn't get the cleanup done
properly.''
   Exxon's representative at the hearing, William Deppe, declined
to comment.
   Alyeska spokesman Tom Brennan said Friday that the company
stands behind its executives' testimony.

   Strong, shifting winds Saturday
night forced the Air Force to postpone the launch of a navigation
satellite designed to tell U.S. and allied forces their location
within 50 feet anywhere on the globe.
   The postponement was announced with the countdown holding at
just four minutes before the intended blastoff time, 7:55 p.m.
   ``The upper level winds are too variable to risk a launch of the
Air Force Delta 2 rocket through that environment tonight,'' said
Lt. Col. Ron Rand, the Air Force launch commentator.
   The countdown had proceeded perfectly throughout the day while
weathermen kept a close watch on the upper altitudewinds. Rand said
late weather balloon data indicated the velocities and directions
of shifting winds were too high to be safe. Wind velocities were
not reported.
   A new launch date was scheduled for 7:51 p.m. Sunday.
   Packed in the nose of the $30 million, 12-story rocket is a $65
million Navstar Global Positioning System satellite, which will
enable military units such as ships, planes, submarines and tanks
to determine their location within 50 feet and in some cases to
within 10 feet.
   The satellite will also keep track of their speed within a
fraction of a mile per hour and the precise time within a millionth
of a second.
   American and allied military users will receive information from
a coded channel. Civilian users, who also have access to the
satellite system, will monitor an open channel that will provide
them with a position accuracy of 300 feet.
   The 3,675-pound Navstar GPS contains an atomic clock with an
error rate of one second every 300,000 years.
   The satellite is the second of 21 upgraded Navstars that the Air
Force plans to orbit to complete a global system by 1992, giving
anyone anywhere in the world 24-hour access to the positioning
information.
   The first advanced Navstar was launched aboard the maiden flight
of the Delta 2 on Feb. 14.
   Seven earlier model Navstar satellites are orbiting the Earth.
The new model has more power and improved systems and has added the
coded military channel.
   The Delta 2 is a more powerful version of the earlier Delta
rocket that has been flying since 1960, logging 170 successes in
182 launches.
   It is one of at least 54 new unmanned rockets the Pentagon is
ordering in a $14 billion program to resolve a post-Challenger
crisis that left about 40 reconnaissance and other national
security payloads languishing in storage for want of a launch
vehicle.
   The backlog was created by the grounding of the space shuttle
fleet for 32 months after the 1986 Challenger explosion. The
Defense Department decided after the accident that it could not
rely solely on the shuttle for access to space and ordered
development of the Delta 2 and a more powerful Titan 4 rocket.
   The Air Force originally had planned to launch all 21 of the
advanced Navstars on the shuttle. All now will fly on Delta 2s.

<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zimbabwe police have denied permission
for a new opposition political party to hold its first public
rallies Sunday to explain why it seeks to replace President Robert
Mugabe's socialist government.
   Edgar Tekere's Zimbabwe Unity Movement (ZUM) was formed last
month with pledges to fight mounting top-level official corruption,
campaign against President Mugabe's aim of establishing a one-party
state next year and halt the march to socialism.
   Tekere, who intended to explain his party's policies at two
separate football stadiums in Harare, was a founder of Mugabe's
governing Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front) party
in 1963.
   A onetime secretary-general of the governing party, Tekere, 52,
was fired from the politburo and the central committee in October
after publicly denouncing corruption and charging that politicians
were building a personality cult around Mugabe. He founded the
oppposition party on April 30.
   The Herald newspaper, published in Harare by the
state-controlled Mass Media Trust, reported Saturday that police
had turned down Tekere's applications for permission to hold the
rallies.
   Under Zimbabwean law, all political gatherings have to be
cleared in advance by the police. Authorities have denied similar
requests by other opposition parties in the past, usually arguing
that they could trigger tensions between rival political supporters.
   ``They did request permission to hold the rallies and the police
did not approve,'' Chief Operations Staff Officer Emmanuel Ruzario
was quoted as saying. ``ZUM were notified of the police decision
within seven days ... We said no.''
   A spokesman for Tekere, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
ZUM would fight the ban in the courts.
   Tekere has declined to say how many members he has in a country
with only three other active political parties. Former Tekere
loyalists have said the formation of ZUM will only create divisions
in Zimbabwe, a British colony until independence nine years ago.
   Mugabe has promised he will transform Zimbabwe into a one-party
state next year after a formal merger of the two main parties, his
own and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (Patriotic Front), in
August.

   Former Sen. Warren G. Magnuson, a quiet but
skilled congressional dealmaker who won billions in federal funds
for his constituents over a 44-year career, died Saturday morning
at his Seattle home. He was 84.
   Magnuson died of congestive heart failure due to complications
from diabetes, said Gretchen Bakamis, a friend and family
spokeswoman.
   ``He went very peacefully, at 6:45 this morning,'' said his
wife, Jermaine Magnuson. ``I was at his side. We had our hugs and
our kisses. He went with dignity and no pain, and that's what I had
prayed for.''
   During his more than four decades in Congress, Magnuson built a
reputation as a potent yet genial wheeler-dealer who preferred to
remain little-known, except by the voters back home who called him
``Maggie.''
   ``There are showhorses and there are workhorses,'' Magnuson once
said. ``The workhorses usually return. The showhorses run into
trouble.''
   Magnuson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1936 and
won the first of his six Senate terms in 1944. He rose to
chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee before being defeated
by Republican Slade Gorton in 1980 _ his only election loss.
   ``He is one of the most significant individuals this state has
ever known,'' said Gov. Booth Gardner, a fellow Democrat. ``He is
an integral part of the history of this state. He was well loved
and appreciated for his contribution.''
   Magnuson's rumpled appearance, ever-present cigar and constant
malapropisms belied his reputation as a consummate Senate insider.
   ``We used to sit in the cloakroom and smoke cigars and chat,''
Magnuson said during a visit to Washington, D.C., after his
retirement. ``In my day, a fellow didn't introduce a bill of major
importance without the committee chairman's approval.''
   ``Now everything is willy-nilly. There isn't the discipline,
there isn't the courtesy there was when I was here.''
   Magnuson played poker in the White House with Presidents
Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, was a confidant of President
John Kennedy, and recruited President Lyndon Johnson as best man
for his second marriage.
   As Appropriations Committee chairman, Magnuson was never shy
about speaking up for Washington state. Among projects for which he
won money are the Hanford nuclear reservation, world's fairs in
Seattle in 1962 and Spokane in 1974, the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard
in Bremerton, Boeing Co. contracts, Columbia River dams and Mount
St. Helens disaster relief.
   Former Vice President Walter Mondale joked in 1980 that Magnuson
divided federal money ``50-50 _ half for Washington state and half
for the rest of the country.''
   But the liberal Magnuson also pushed legislation regulating
flammable fabrics, auto safety, cigarette labeling and truth in
packaging. And he was a champion of medical research, conservation
issues, the 18-year-old vote and measures to make oil vessels safer.
   After his 1980 defeat, he swore he wouldn't be a lame duck, but
a ``retired rooster.'' He campaigned successfully for a Seattle
city bond issue for senior housing and was a mainstay at Democratic
fundraisers.
   House Majority Leader Tom Foley, D-Wash., said he was 7 or 8
years old when he first met then-Congressman Magnuson in 1936.
   ``Maggie was a tremendous model to me of someone who had almost
unlimited influence on the affairs of the Senate and the nation,
but yet always kept this easy, casual manner,'' Foley said.
   Magnuson and Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson, who died in 1983, were
known as the ``Gold Dust Twins.'' Together they led a Washington
state congressional delegation that during the 1960s and 1970s was
known as one of the most influential on Capitol Hill.
   ``Magnuson was a very warm-hearted and compassionate person and
I think he cared more about people in this state than anyone I ever
knew,'' said Helen Jackson, the late senator's wife.
   Magnuson's inability to pronounce names was legendary. He once
called Olympics committee legend Avery Brundage ``Mr. Average
Brundy,'' and was known to call Johnson aide Joseph Califano ``Joe
Cauliflower.''
   ``No one is sure how much was intentional and how much wasn't,''
said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who once worked on Magnuson's staff.
   Warren Grant Magnuson was born April 12, 1905, in Moorhead,
Minn., and was orphaned before he was a month old. He was adopted
by a Swedish couple and took their name.
   He attended public schools, the University of North Dakota at
Grand Forks, and North Dakota State College.
   At 17, Magnuson rode the rails to Seattle. He entered the
University of Washington in 1924 and worked his way through school
delivering ice. He graduated with a law degree in 1929, and
practiced law for a time.
   He was elected to the Washington state House in 1932, briefly
served as a U.S. attorney in Seattle in 1934 and was King County
Prosecuting attorney from 1934 to 1936, when he won his first term
in the U.S. House.
   His service in the House was interrupted by an eight-month hitch
in the Navy in the South Pacific during World War II.
   Apart from his wife, Magnuson is survived by a daughter, Juanita
Garrison, and two grandchildren.

   Ku Klux Klansmen held a recruitment rally
Saturday but drew mostly bottles and cans thrown by protesters.
Police arrested eight people.
   More than 40 police officers, including state police in riot
gear and mounted officers, turned out for the rally by about 25
Klansmen at Ephrata Community Park in this city about 50 miles west
of Philadelphia. About 300 people watched from behind police lines
   About 10 minutes into the rally, two men threw bottles and cans
at Klansmen on the other side of a security fence. The two were
arrested.
   Fifteen minutes later, about 15 members of the New York
City-based International Committee Against Racism arrived with
signs and bullhorns, and tried to shout down the robed Klansmen
with such slogans as ``Death to the Klan.'' Klansmen made no move
toward the counterdemonstrators.
   Most of those arrested belonged to the anti-racism group.
   Six people were charged with disorderly conduct, one with
resisting arrest and disorderly conduct and one with public
drunkenness, said police Sgt. Brian Kurtz.

<TEXT>
   Hong Kong reacted nervously Saturday to China's
declaration of martial law, fearing the move might mean Beijing
will restrict freedoms in this British colony when it comes under
Chinese sovereignty in eight years.
   Under a Chinese-British agreement signed in 1984, China has
promised to preserve Hong Kong's capitalist lifestyle for 50 years
beyond 1997 under a unique ``one country, two systems'' formula.
   Chinese Premier Li Peng declared martial law in parts of the
capital Saturday after authorities were unable to quell massive
student-led protests for democratic reform.
   Liberal groups in Hong Kong condemned the decision, urging
residents to shelve their political differences and support the
student movement.
   They said the failure of the student movement could affect Hong
Kong's future and weaken China's promises to retain the
free-wheeling socioeconomic system that has made the colony a world
financial center.
   ``If they go against the freedom of human rights, Hong Kong
people will lose confidence in the (Chinese) government,'' said Lam
Wai-keung, a member of the lawmaking Legislative Council.
   Businessmen say Hong Kong's economy could suffer should the
situation in China deteriorate further, especially if clashes erupt
between students and the military.
   Hong Kong depends on China for its food and trade, and its
economy and stock market react violently to political developments
on the mainland.
   On Friday, the Hang Seng stock index plummeted 132.03 points in
panic selling over news from China, including the reported
resignation of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang. The
moderate Zhao had pushed for a compromise with the students.
   It was the worst single-day plunge since the worldwide market
collapse in October 1987. Brokers say the market could suffer
further when it opens Monday unless the crisis in China stabilizes.
   For Hong Kong's 5.7 million residents, 98 percent of whom are
Chinese, the thought of a future under Communism is a haunting one.
   An estimated two-thirds of them are refugees from China or their
descendants, who fled from despair or political persecution on the
mainland.
   A poll conducted by the conservative English-language South
China Morning Post earlier this month said one-third of Hong Kong's
population is considering emigrating before the territory reverts
to China in 1997.

   Premier Zeid Bin Shaker on Saturday
appointed Mohammed Saeed Nabulsi as head of the government's
Central Bank, the official Jordan news agency reported.
   It said Nabulsi replaced Hussein Kassem, who held the post since
1985.
   There have been numerous administrative changes since riots
forced the resignation of Prime Minister Zaid Rifai on April 26.
Protesters blamed Rifai for the kingdom's mounting economic
problems.
   Jordan ran up a $6 billion foreign debt over the past decade and
as part of an austerity package adopted by Rifai's administration
prices of essential commodities increased by 20 to 50 percent.
   Anti-price riots followed. King Hussein blamed the economic
crisis on what he called the failure of oil-rich Arab states to
provide promised financial aid.
   Nabulsi was governor of the Central Bank from 1973-85 and
resigned when Rifai took office in 1985.
   He was the finance minister in 1972-73. After leaving the
Central Bank he served as an adviser to the International Monetary
Fund for three years.

   Police on Saturday arrested two protesters
who scaled a fence surrounding the Seabrook nuclear power plant and
spent six hours atop a tower that supports high-voltage power lines.
   The demonstrators hung a banner from two legs of the tower
urging people to oppose low-power tests, which could start this
month at the reactor.
   Seabrook spokesman Rob Williams denounced the action as ``very
irresponsible'' and dangerous. But Seabrook police said they saw no
reason to forcibly remove Harry Leno, 52, of Ipswich, Mass., and
Christopher Nord, 36, of Merrimac, Mass., from the tower.
   The protesters climbed about 50 feet up the tower, but were
``nowhere near'' the 345,000-volt power line above them, said
Seabrook police Sgt. David Currier.
   ``It was certainly no danger,'' Currier said. ``We would have
simply left them up there until they got tired.''
   When they came down, Leno and Nord were charged with criminal
trespass, issued summonses and released.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave final approval to a
low-power license last week. A federal appeals court is reviewing a
request by Seabrook foes to delay the tests.
   Protests against Seabrook have resulted in about 2,500 arrests
since construction began in 1976.

   Police arrested more than 100 anti-abortion
protesters who tried to block entrances to two women's clinics
Saturday as abortion rights supporters formed a human chain to keep
one clinic open.
   Farther east in Pittsburgh, about 4,000 people prayed and sang
as they marched through downtown to an anti-abortion rally.
   The Cleveland protest was staged by Operation Rescue, a
Binghamton, N.Y.-based group that has staged numerous anti-abortion
demonstrations around the country resulting in mass arrests.
   Police Cmdr. William Stanley said 105 people were arrested at
Preterm-Cleveland and the Abortion Clnic of National Health Care
Services on the city's east side.
   However, the demonstrators' attorney, Edward J. Heben, put the
number at 119, including a juvenile.
   Demonstrators were charged with aggravated disorderly conduct,
resisting arrest and, in some cases, criminal trespassing, Stanley
said.
   Preterm clinic director Carolyn Buhl said scheduled appointments
were kept and there were no delays. ``Things went on as they
normally do.''
   Mrs. Buhl joined others outside the clinic to escort patients
inside.
   ``We formed a human chain to prevent Operation Rescue from
sealing off the doors,'' said abortion rights demonstrator Deborah
Meyer.
   Pittsburgh's rally, the 10th Annual Greater Pittsburgh March for
Life, was attended by about 4,000 people, estimated police Cmdr.
Edward Patterson.

   About 400 Communist Party members
demanding reforms on Saturday opened a two-day national conference
in this southern Hungarian city.
   It was a followup to an unprecedented meeting in Kecskemet on
April 15 when the reformers questioned the future of the party that
has ruled the country since the end of World War II.
   Gyorgy Kerenyi, a party leader in eastern Hungary said in his
opening address:
   ``We don't want to leave it (the party), we want to take it
over, thus paving the way for a massive transformation to bring
about a self-reliant, democratic and socialist party.
   ``The party needs a leadership that both listens to its members
and lets them decide. We've had enough of the sneaky and stealthy
way of doing politics.''
   Jozsef Geczi, a representative of the Csongrad district, said
Hungary's Communist Party cannot rid itself of the model built by
Josef Stalin, the late Soviet dictator, ``until it changes its own
internal mechanism and structure.''
   He said that would require the convening of a special party
congress next fall.
   Organizers said the conference was divided into five workshops
to consider the decades of one-party rule, the transition to a
democratic constitution and economic policies.
   Gyorgy Kerekes, a Budapest sociologist, said the conference has
gone ``well beyond the get-acquainted'' session in Kecskemet.
   He said members are debating the role of a younger generation
``who want no share of the stigma of the past'' but want to take
responsibility for the present and future.
   ``They feel they must either succeed in reforming the party
within the next few months and put the reformers in the lead or,
failing that, quit the party and start an independent left-wing
political party.''

   Thousands of Chinese college students staged raucous protests
Saturday from San Francisco to New York in support of the
pro-democracy uprising in their homeland, chanting slogans and
carrying banners reading ``Freedom or Death.''
   ``We are all supporting the students in China. They are heros,''
Lewis Lu, a business student at the University of California in
Berkeley, said during a rally in San Francisco that included a
meeting with Chinese consular officials.
   Demonstrations also were held in Washington, D.C.; Los Angeles,
New York, Chicago, St. Paul, Minn.; Honolulu and Montana. No
arrests were reported.
   The protests followed the declaration of martial law for
sections of Beijing on Saturday by Chinese Premier Li Peng in
response to huge demonstrations there, considered the largest
challenge to the nation's communist rule since its founding in 1949.
   But hundreds of thousands of people continued to swarm through
the streets of China's capital in defiance of martial law and in
support of the students who have led the uprising.
   The United States is host to an estimated 40,000 students from
the People's Republic of China.
   One of the largest demonstrations in this country took place in
Washington, D.C., where about 3,500 students marched on China's
embassy, shouting ``Down with martial law!'' and ``Freedom now!''
Some were natives of Taiwan or Hong Kong, but the vfast majority
were citizens of mainland China.
   In spite of final examinations going on at many schools,
students came from Cornell, Princeton, Harvard, Yale, Brandeis,
Duke, New York and Johns Hopkins universities and the universities
of Virginia, California, Pennsylvania and Pittsburgh, as well as
several schools in the Washington area.
   ``We want to show our support for other people who are fighting
for our freedom, and to show our own government that its position
is wrong,'' said Qiao Chun Ming of Shanghai, a student at Pitt.
   More than 3,000 students rallied near the Chinese consulate in
Chicago, chanting, ``Down with Li Peng, up with freedom!''
   In downtown Grant Park, they placed a sign reading ``Beijing We
Hear You. Do You Hear Us'' at the feet of a statue of Abraham
Lincoln.
   Among the demonstrators was Ciping Huang, 26, who drove with
about 20 others from the University of Toledo.
   ``It was an emergency call,'' she said. ``I told my boss I
couldn't stay (at work) any longer because my country is in
emergency status.''
   Others flocked to the Chicago demonstration from Purdue,
Marquette, Illinois State and Michigan State universities and the
universities of Notre Dame, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Michigan, Indiana and Louisville.
   In San Francisco, about 1,000 demonstrators, many wearing white
headbands, held a rally at the Chinese consulate, then marched to
Chinatown.
   They jabbed the air with signs in Chinese and English carrying
such messages as ``A Billion People, One Press'' and ``Freedom or
Death.'' One placard compared senior leader Deng Xiaoping to Adolf
Hitler.
   Cars crawling through snarled traffic honked in support.
   A handful of the protesters were allowed into the Chinese
consulate to meet with officials.
   ``Some of the (students') demands are justified,'' said Shaosha
Wong, a political and press officer at the consulate. Asked which
demands, he replied haltingly, ``Carry on the reforms.''
   In Los Angeles, about 500 to 700 students marched from Chinatown
to the Chinese consulate amid honking and chants. Marchers came
from Arizona State University, the University of Southern
California and University of California campuses in San Diego and
Santa Barbara.
   About 200 people gathered in New York's Chinatown, then marched
through the neighborhood, their ranks swelling by another 100.
Onlookers shouted and clapped from fire escapes and drivers honked
their horns.
   Chinese students collected $5,000 in just three hours to buy fax
machines, computers and paper to help communicate with students in
China, said Lu Dong, 34, a Hunter College graduate.
   In other protests Saturday:
   _Some 150 Chinese students and scholars chanted and carried
signs on a march from the East-West Center on the University of
Hawaii campus in Honolulu several miles through Waikiki, Hawaii's
main tourist area.
   _In Bozeman, Mont., about 60 flag- and placard-carrying Chinese
students and supporters at Montana State University marched down
Main Street to show support for their comrades, prompting friendly
waves from onlookers and honks from passing motorists. About 40
students at the University of Montana in Missoula also held a
demonstration.
   _In St. Paul, Minn., about 30 Chinese-Americans rallied at the
state Capitol, chanting among other slogans ``Long live students.''

   The government says the U.S. Embassy
was indirectly involved in post-election violence this month that
left three opposition leaders injured and one of their bodyguards
dead.
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Terry Kneebone, responding to a
government communique issued late Friday, said the attempted
linkage was ``propaganda foolishness.''
   Police on Friday arrested 17 Panamanians who provide security at
U.S. Embassy offices, the embassy reported. Fifteen were quickly
released, embassy officials said.
   The government led by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega said the
guards were questioned as part of an investigation into violence
May 10, three days after the national election and the same day the
government annulled the results. International observers say the
opposition was winning by a 3-to-1 margin.

oath to protect their companies' financial interests, a state
official charges.
   The latest skirmish in the battle of blame over the nation's
largest oil spill came Friday after the fourth day of fact-finding

hearings conclude today.
   Alaska's representative at the hearings, Bob LeResche, accused
representatives of Exxon Shipping Co. and Alyeska Pipeline Service
Co. of conducting a disinformation campaign to help limit their

   The unexpectedly strong income tax payments
pouring into the federal Treasury are prompting analysts to predict
that the government's budget deficit this year may undershoot
official projections.
   The Treasury Department reported Friday that the government
posted a record $41.45 billion budget surplus in April.
   While tax payments always inflate the government's coffers in
April, the bulge was much bigger than expected and three times the
size of the $13.77 billion surplus registered in April 1988.
   For the first seven months of fiscal 1989, which began Oct. 1,
the government ran a $86.98 billion deficit, 17.9 percent smaller
than the $105.84 billion shortfall at the comparable point in the
previous fiscal year.

   A flood of complaints has forced the
government to withdraw a plan to cut back on federal inspections at
plants that turn out hot dogs, chicken soup and other processed
foods using meat and poultry.
   But officials of the Agriculture Department left open the
possibility they would revive the proposal later on, and a meat
industry spokesman said a consensus might be sought.
   Since the proposal was announced in November, there have been
many complaints that it would put greater reliance on the plants
themselves to meet federal inspection standards.
   Lester M. Crawford, head of the department's Food Safety and
Inspection Service, said the proposal was withdrawn, at least for
the time being, ``in direct response'' to more than 1,800 comments
from the public since it was announced last fall. Most opposed all
or parts of the proposal. He said the agency will gather additional
information and then determine if a new plan will be drafted.

the building as a state landmark.
   It was in the wooden garage that William R. Hewlett and David
Packard in 1938 parlayed $538 in capital and an audio oscillator
into one of the world's leading electronics companies.
   Their firm, which employs 87,000 people, is headquartered a
couple of miles away in Palo Alto.
   But after poking around the dark and dingy interior, Hewlett and
Packard said they did not accept its billing as ``birthplace of
Silicon Valley,'' and were not eager to reminisce.
   ``I'm not very strong on reminiscing,'' said Packard. ``I think
we ought to be looking forward instead of backward.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Makes It More Difficult To Sue Your Broker</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1951, an investor sued his stockbroker after
losing $3,333 on a bum tip about a takeover deal.
   The case, Wilko vs. Swan, tested the limits of mandatory
arbitration agreements that brokerages typically require to settle
disputes. Ruling two years later, the Supreme Court said
arbitration pacts weren't binding under a 1933 federal securities
law.
   The decision stood until last week when the court reversed
itself, closing what was widely viewed as the final window of
opportunity for an investor to bypass industry-run arbitration
proceedings and sue a broker.
   The 5-4 ruling means that if an investor signs a contract with a
brokerage house requiring arbitration in the event of a fraud
claim, a dispute must go to a panel of arbitrators for resolution.
The courts won't listen.
   ``This puts everything in place,'' said William J. Fitzpatrick,
general counsel for the Securities Industry Association. ``It says
if you have an arbitration agreement, no matter what theory is
raised or how you peg your claim ... it goes to arbitration.''
   The Supreme Court in 1984 said all state securities law cases
had to be arbitrated if a signed pact exists. In 1987, the court
applied the same standard to an anti-fraud section of the federal
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
   The current ruling applies to a narrower anti-fraud provision of
the Securities Act of 1933 that gives people who buy securities an
avenue to complain about brokers.
   The three rulings cover all bases for how a client can contest a
broker-dealer's behavior.
   While the latest decision should clear federal court dockets of
an estimated 100-plus cases in which investors have challenged
arbitration agreements, it won't clear away criticism of a system
many claim is biased in favor of the securities industry.
   In arbitration agreements, investors normally waive their right
to sue and agree that fraud claims will be resolved by a panel of
arbitrators appointed under federal guidelines by the New York
Stock Exchange, National Association of Securities Deealers or
other industry body.
   The number of arbitration claims has increased more than
seven-fold this decade, to 6,100 in 1988 from just 830 in 1980.
   In the NYSE system, one securities industry arbitrator and two
from outside the industry conduct a hearing into a claim and can
issue judgments and award penalties. The exchange claims its
arbitration decisions are about 50-50 for investors and brokers,
with 1988 awards ranging from $100 to $2 million.
   A recent Securities and Exchange Commission study of NYSE cases
found that arbitration is indeed cheaper and quicker than
litigation. From filing to judgment, court cases took about 18
months, vs. 12 for arbitration. Median legal costs were $5,100 for
litigation and $3,250 for arbitration. But the amount of claims
recovered did not differ, the study found.
   The SEC last year also found that only 39 percent of cash
accounts _ typically used by individual investors _ at major
brokerages mandated abitration but more than 95 percent of more
sophisticated options and margin accounts did.
   Investor groups complain that brokerages don't always tell new
clients they can't sue. To that end, the SEC is forcing firms to
provide more information. Massachusetts has gone even further,
banning arbitration agreements that prohibit legal action. But a
federal district court blocked the law and an appeals court hearing
is set for next month.
   More than a dozen states are awaiting the outcome of the
Massachusetts case before enacting similar anti-arbitration laws.

<HEAD>``Dow 2,500'' Revisited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little less than two years after the Dow Jones
industrial average first crossed 2,500, the stock market has passed
that landmark again.
   The first time it happened, in July of 1987, it seemed only
natural. Prices had been rising for five years, acting as though
they were headed for the sky. Wall Street was awash in prosperity.
   This time, the mood is much different. Brokerage firm layoffs
make regular headlines, and worries abound in the financial world
about inflation and a possible recession.
   In the summer of '87, as it turned out, the market had a date
with disaster. Starting in late August, the Dow average fell almost
1,000 points in a matter of eight weeks.
   But now, the optimists of Wall Street contend, conditions are
far different from the runaway exuberance that set the stage for
the crash.
   ``The market appears to be somewhat undervalued'' using
price-earning ratios as a gauge, argues Richard Sichel, director of
research at the First Pennsylvania Bank in Philadelphia.
   ``We have come a long way since October of 1987 with the Dow
Jones industrials setting post-crash highs on a consistent basis.
   ``There is still ample cash on the sidelines to keep prices up
and ownership of equities is generally low by historical
standards.''
   Now that the Dow is just a shade more than 200 points below its
1987 peak of 2,722.42, ``there is the possibility of a new record
high this year,'' declares William LeFevre at Advest Inc.
   All this has amazed the many skeptics who have been lying low
since the crash, fearful of the economic and financial woes the
market's slide appared to be foretelling. Could the record-breaking
drop really have been nothing more than an outsized ``correction,''
just a temporary break in a long upward trend?
   That view has been collecting more and more believers of late as
stocks have posted gains in six of the past seven weeks.
   The Dow Jones industrials closed Friday at 2,501.10, up 61.40
points from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.79 to 178.92;
the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market gained
7.22 to 442.05, and the American Stock Exchange market value index
was up 5.53 at 353.83.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 192.71 million shares a day, up
from 160.87 million the week before.
   The widely accepted explanation for the market's recent strength
is growing faith that the Federal Reserve is succeeding in its
campaign against inflation, fostering a decline in interest rates
without inflicting any lasting harm on the economy.
   ``With the slowing economy and slowing price inflation, we would
appear to be two-thirds of the way toward a soft landing,''
observed Edward Kerschner, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.
   ``The question the market will increasingly address now concerns
the final one-third of the scenario: Will earnings hold up?
   ``It appears more and more that this is a `different' economic
cycle _ the soft landing.
   ``But, remember, if things don't prove `different' _ either
rates don't fall fast enough and-or profits don't stay strong
enough _ current interest rates suggest the market is 15 percent to
25 percent overvalued.''
   The Fed's seeming success in restraining inflation is very
favorable for bonds, Kirschner acknowledges. But he says it remains
to be seen whether it will be as beneficial to the stock market.

   Beer drinkers will see two messages this year _
one telling them alcohol consumption may cause health problems, and
the other claiming beer is ``as basic as bread.''
   While the first message will appear on government warning labels
on alcoholic beverage containers, the second will be included in
advertisements by Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the nation's largest
brewer.
   Anheuser, however, is not alone in defending its product. In an
industry battered by concerns over alcohol abuse and drunken
driving, some executives have decided to fight back and tell the
public that beer not only is safe but has a revered place in
cultural history.
   ``Most of the action has been on the playing field of the
critics,'' said James Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, a
trade association in Washington. ``We need to get out of the
reactive mode and into a proactive mode.''
   The U.S. beer industry has been stagnant in recent years, and
analysts say one cause has been a changing social attitude toward
drinking and a greater awareness of alcohol's potential hazards.
   But industry officials say they have been portrayed too often as
villains, and they say beer can be enjoyed safely if consumed
responsibly.
   ``Beer drinkers are not drug addicts,'' Leonard Goldstein,
president of Miller Brewing Co., said in an April speech to
Wisconsin beer distributors. ``Throughout history, beer has
provided lots of enjoyment for millions of consumers.''
   But, he added, ``if ever there was a time for our industry to
pull together and fight for control of our own destiny, that time
is now.''
   Last December, the U.S. Surgeon General's office held a workshop
on drunk driving and issued preliminary recommendations, which
Goldstein called ``an obituary for the alcohol beverage industry.''
   Among them were measures to ban alcohol advertisements by
celebrities ``who have a strong appeal to youth,'' and to create
equal time for public service spots to balance the advertising of
alcoholic products. Final recommendations will be included in a
report due May 31.
   Also last year, Congress passed the alcohol labeling law, which
takes effect in November. Labels on beverage containers will alert
people to the hazards of drinking while pregnant and warn how
alcohol can impair the ability to drive or operate machinery.
   A major supporter of alcohol labeling has been the Center for
Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group in
Washington. The center also has lobbied Congress for higher excise
taxes on alcohol.
   ``We're not interested in curtailing all alcohol use, in the
sense of being neo-prohibitionists,'' said Karen Lieberman, who
works on the center's alcohol policies project. ``We want to curb
alcohol problems.''
   Similarly, Micky Sadoff, president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, said: ``We've never taken a position against alcohol in
general. I drink myself.
   ``We're talking about the combination of alcohol and driving,
and flying, and boating and snowmobiling.''
   But beer industry officials, who share concerns about alcohol
abuse and drunken driving, have opposed the labeling law as a scare
tactic.
   ``We think it's not a contribution,'' said Sanders, of the Beer
Institute. ``You don't tell the whole story in a couple of words.''
   ``You might have young people who think that their parents who
open a beer at dinner are drug pushers,'' he said.
   The Beer Institute is planning a promotion to ``give the true
story of the beer industry,'' Sanders said. ``If beer is treated
with good sense, it works itself into a healthy lifestyle.''
   Anheuser, based in St. Louis, is expanding its ``Know when to
say when'' ad campaign aimed at responsible drinking. In addition,
the company will incorporate a message of moderation into another
campaign, to begin running later this year, which will trace the
tradition of beer through history.
   One ad will use early American paintings to show how beer was
brought to America on the Mayflower, was used to celebrate the
first Thanksgiving and was part of the daily ration for soldiers in
the American Revolution.
   A second ad, which shows how the art of brewing has passed down
through centuries, contains this line: ``It's older than the
written word and as basic as bread.''
   ``It talks about the heritage and the quality of beer,'' said
Steve Burrows, staff vice president in marketing at Anheuser.
``We've taken that quality message and put in a responsible
drinking message.''
   Such promotions could help push the pendulum of public opinion
in the beer industry's direction, said Anita Rosepka, senior editor
of Beverage Media, a trade publication in New York.
   ``I think the industry has had the attitude that publicity will
swing back to normal,'' she said. ``But now it's the time to do
something. It's gone on too long.''
   ``Their attempts are notable,'' Lieberman said, referring to the
beer companies' promotions of responsible drinking. ``But their
messages fall far short.''
   She said even statements like ``know when to say when''
encourage some use of the product.
   ``There's no message that abstinence is a serious option,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Looking Beyond Food and Energy: Is Inflation Spiral Spinning?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The economy should stay on a restricted credit
diet while it works off an inflationary bulge. Breaking the diet
now would keep the economy from getting into good shape.
   At least that's the view of a number of observers who think the
time isn't right for the Federal Reserve Board to dole out bigger
helpings of credit. Current rations are providing sufficient
nourishment for the economy to grow without slipping into a
recession, they say.
   Judging by the mood in the bond market this past week,
professional traders don't necessarily agree with this prescription.
   Bond prices moved up despite word from the Labor Department that
the Consumer Price Index rose 0.7 percent in April. Bonds benefited
from increasing optimism that the Fed soon will be able to loosen
its grip on credit and permit interest rates to fall.
   At first glance, the unexpectedly large CPI reading looked like
bad news for bonds. But traders quickly overcame their initial
shock, comforted from the realization that much of the thrust
behind last month's inflation rate was fueled by the largest
gasoline price surge on record.
   Excluding energy prices, which were affected by supply
disruptions after an Exxon oil tanker beached off the Alaskan
coast, the CPI rose 0.2 percent.
   In the opinion of economist Norman Ture, president of the
Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation, the special
factors that elevated the April CPI exaggerated the true inflation
rate.
   ``It's very difficult to see any reason for an inflationary
resurgence,'' Ture says.
   He says sentiment in the precious metals market supports this
view. Prices of gold, a commodity that investors frequently turn to
as a hedge against inflation, dropped late last week to the lowest
levels in three years.
   Though he doesn't consider gold prices a reliable gauge of
inflation expectations, Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa
Securities America Inc., shares the idea that the worst news on
inflation this year may be over.
   ``My view on inflation is that we'll see a very gradual easing
off of inflation during the course of the year,'' says Moran, a
former Fed economist.
   He says the central bank's credit-tightening actions late last
year and earlier in 1989 were enough to bring inflation under
control. Relaxing the restrictive stance now would risk inflation
getting out of hand, he says.
   So the Fed mustn't react to recent signs of slower economic
growth by immediately driving down interest rates, says Moran.
   ``How should the Fed respond to this situation? I think they
should be very cautious in easing monetary policy,'' he says.
   ``If they were to ease off too early we could get a bounce back
in the economy,'' says Moran, adding ``the risk is greater that
we'll have a pickup in inflation rather than a recesssion.''
   Recession may be all the more unlikely because the dollar's
recent surge is stimulating economic growth and partly countering
the negative impact of higher U.S. interest rates.
   Lacy Hunt, chief economist at the investment firm CM&amp;M Group,
says the strong dollar will spur consumer spending _ if it hasn't
already _ by cutting the price of imported merchandise.
   An inflow of foreign money, lured by the attractive returns that
high U.S. rates imply, could help rejuvenate the housing and other
sectors of the economy bruised by rising credit costs, Hunt says.
   For these reasons, he says, ``the inflation number was bad but
it didn't matter because of the surging dollar.''
